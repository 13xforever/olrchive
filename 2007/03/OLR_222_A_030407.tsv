13834	19304	Tonight, March 4th, 2007, drama ensues over Sony's rumored PlayStation Home.
19425	26318	We talk about who is starting an anti-Wii campaign, and the popular new computer game is rumored to be making a jump to Xbox Live.
32188	38852	Hello everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, their Zens, whatever devices you're using to listen to us.
38892	43255	Maybe your Xbox 360, thanks to the 360 cast or whatever that thing was called.
43735	45616	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
45916	49639	We are a show dedicated to video games and gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.
50119	54842	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
55042	55362	Yo.
55682	57103	How you doing, Mr. Jamie Summers?
58604	58764	Ow.
59565	59705	Ow?
59745	60165	What's wrong?
60645	61166	Your head hurt?
61526	61686	No.
62062	62262	What?
63103	63743	Female owl.
64244	64824	Oh, oh.
65405	65685	I see.
65725	67186	The TMI type of owl, huh?
67407	67647	Yes.
67767	68327	Sorry to hear it.
68728	71190	Well, I'm sure we'll have some extra special FUs tonight.
71590	71830	Yes.
72130	73251	But overall, a good weekend.
73271	75453	Jamie and I had a play day yesterday in San Francisco.
75513	76014	That was fun.
76334	76854	Mm-hmm.
76874	77375	It was a good time.
78116	79617	And we both have really hot hair now.
80077	81118	Yes, we got our hair done.
81438	83900	That's the first time I've ever paid $45 for a haircut.
84361	85121	But it looks nice.
85762	86202	Be glad.
86563	88764	You know how much I pay for mine.
89065	90446	Isn't that a sexist thing?
91369	93933	I have more hair and I have more shit done to my hair.
94033	95575	What if I was a dude with long hair?
96096	96897	It'd probably charge you more.
97117	97438	You think?
97798	97959	Yeah.
98119	101824	Not that I would ever have long hair, but I've seen guys with longer hair than a lot of women I know.
101904	104908	Well, like Marissa's boyfriend.
105169	105930	Oh, that's true, yeah.
106110	107212	He's got gorgeous...
108075	109836	and gorgeous supermodel hair.
110216	116660	I think of, if I remember right, I think he chopped it off at one point, but remember Blue from DDR Freak, who's really into Pump It Up?
116700	117661	Didn't he have kind of long hair?
117721	119382	Like, he almost had it in a ponytail, didn't he?
119842	121163	Yeah, he had really, really long hair.
121183	122584	Yes, that's who I kind of think of.
122604	123104	I remember him.
123464	125305	Anyway, say hello as well.
125846	131249	Before we talk about people who aren't here to defend themselves too much, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
132450	133510	Yes, I'm here.
133951	134731	How are you doing, Loki?
135312	135952	I'm doing good.
136226	142447	Great, I see you have not one, but two PSPs up and running with Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
142467	143948	Are you playing against yourself tonight?
143968	144668	What is going on here?
144928	146908	Yeah, I was just testing stuff.
147008	148629	He's playing with himself on live radio.
149769	151369	Fun, what types of things are you testing out?
152469	159191	Just Dark Galaxy's custom firmware, because it allowed me to run PS1 games on it.
161818	163639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
187216	188496	Such as I've done for the past three weeks.
188516	195578	So the custom firmware that I got, I got like a nice two gig memory stick so I can put, you know, PlayStation 1 games on there.
196099	201020	So that's kind of what I was doing because I, you know, have this other PlayStation or PSP.
201040	202801	I'm like, well, what the hell am I going to do with this thing?
202861	207542	So load up a custom firmware and I can make it all pretty because you can edit all the icons.
207562	209723	You can add the waves in the background, everything.
210063	213524	And you run Homebrew off of a memory stick.
213544	214244	Plus you can run...
215595	219396	Programs that require firmware 3.10 or 3.03, I guess.
220296	222057	And so it's like the best of both worlds.
223377	225018	All right.
225318	228279	Also joining us tonight, we don't have any other guests in studio.
228319	229119	That's a first.
229179	230720	We haven't had that in a long time.
230820	233160	So it's going to be a relatively quiet show tonight.
233200	233541	I don't know.
234141	234481	We'll see.
234801	236561	The three of us will entertain you the best we can.
236581	241463	But, of course, we always have our invisible other guest with us every week, the chat room.
241503	244244	And that's accessible over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
245390	246270	XB Stream.
246351	249732	That's the name of the Xbox 360 program I was trying to think of at the beginning.
250112	251753	You can listen to us on XB Stream.
252093	253614	We're one of the default podcasts.
254394	255154	I forgot about that.
255214	259516	Thank you to the XB Stream folks, and don't be too mad at me for forgetting your name.
260477	260917	Let's see.
261017	262198	Looking at the chat room there.
262878	264919	Alpha Canogram says, the soundboard is cursed.
265659	266840	We don't really use a soundboard.
266920	268060	It's just Winamp.
268100	268941	Nothing too fancy.
269241	269721	It's Rob.
270339	270799	It's my fault.
270999	275601	Actually, if I did switch to a soundboard, it would probably be easier, but I don't like the whole soundboard setup thing.
276761	281003	Plus, I feel like if I had a soundboard, I would use it far too much.
282823	288806	Not to say there's other shows out there that do use it too much, but I'm just thinking that we'd probably use it too much.
289486	292227	Blaze says that's three weeks in a row they've effed up the soundboard.
292267	293047	Yep, something like that.
293807	294868	I didn't eff up anything.
294968	296328	I was sitting here in my chair.
298249	298629	Sitting here.
299420	300501	All right, let's see.
301902	304184	Damani says, I got Crash Bandicoot on my PSP.
304465	306607	Remember when Crash Bandicoot was cool?
306787	307007	No.
307347	310190	Before it went the way of Spyro and all those other franchises.
310210	311831	They just drove into the ground.
312091	313293	No, I never remember it being cool.
313673	314734	It was cool at one point.
314774	316896	Crash Bandicoot 2 was the first PlayStation game I ever owned.
317236	318737	I never remember that game being cool.
318818	319258	Well, whatever.
320219	320619	Let's see.
321620	322221	What else is here?
322421	325784	Firebomba says, anyway, anyone here play Magic?
326997	330518	I haven't since I was in college the first time around.
330798	336880	Dude, I sold my deck when I was a junior in high school, which was a long time ago, over 10 years ago, if you can believe it.
337340	338481	And it's still going strong.
338541	339981	I remember the old computer game.
340201	343762	Not the one you could play online, but the very first computer game that ever came out.
343822	344603	I really liked that.
344703	347964	I remember you walked around a map and battled other people.
347984	349964	I should try and find that and play it again.
350024	354946	It was kind of fun, but I don't think they really make it anymore because didn't they go online with it?
355518	361420	SSJ100 Matt says, I remember the old Crash commercials where he would always cause trouble outside of Nintendo.
361460	363201	I remember that as well.
363221	364862	That's pretty cool.
364922	367783	Let's see, also, RK1HexAugust31st wants to know,
381006	382987	What about the part where you call out the noobs?
383268	384348	Well, alright, we can do that.
384408	385669	The noobs in chat tonight.
385969	388130	Of course, I don't rec- again, I'm going off memory.
388931	390992	DarkSakura, you may have to help me if you don't recognize any of these names.
391252	393654	I think, well, first off, that name I just named is new.
393914	395555	RK1HexOg31.
396295	396655	Let's see.
397456	398736	Broodwitch, I think, is new.
399857	402178	Alistar, I recognize from our World of Warcraft guild.
402218	402559	Hello.
402579	404580	Let's see, who else is new?
404980	406361	I don't know if I recognize any other new names.
407702	408282	Jodrew?
408362	409183	Have we had that before?
409223	409863	I might be new, too.
410501	410581	No!
410601	410641	No!
439099	440540	I like Metroid.
440560	446444	Look, I know you're really, well, then you should really like Castlevania Symphony of the Night because it ripped off Metroid in many ways, but that's what made it so great.
446864	448826	I'm going to kick DM in too, just because.
448906	449366	Okay, do it.
449386	451247	What was I going to say?
451687	455590	Rondo of Blood you love, but Symphony of the Night was kind of in some ways a sequel to Rondo of Blood.
455630	456891	You love Symphony of the Night a lot, right?
458812	460773	Yeah, that was a sequel to Rondo of Blood.
460854	460994	Right.
461094	464496	Are you going to play it on Xbox Live Arcade?
465126	467307	Or are you going to say, eh, why should I download this?
467547	470389	I already have the PlayStation and Saturn and whatever else.
470869	475992	And I don't really have a need to because I do have the other versions.
477853	482456	Although, to this one's credit, it'll be... If it's the Saturn version, hell yeah.
482836	483337	No, it won't be.
483437	483977	Then, no.
484117	486098	It'll be enabled for your HDTV.
486238	492682	Granted, it's got the stupid stagnant graphics on the side, but at least you won't have to worry about altering your TV settings or any of that stuff.
493220	493480	DarkSakura
521377	523538	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
541879	543600	It actually is a really good game.
543660	544300	It's surprising.
544380	547022	Although the PS3 version, it obviously is just a port.
547643	549124	Because nothing is prettier.
549444	551165	Well, I mean, it's really pretty.
551806	554908	The gameplay itself, but the cinemas are not touched up for it.
555388	560892	But the only complaint I really have with that game is the camera sometimes getting a little bit weird.
561773	564935	And the boss is in the Atlantis level right now.
565695	566476	But it was really cool.
566496	569118	It was like, dude, what the hell is Mysterio doing here?
570110	574715	I've determined that playing as Elektra sucks, but playing as Captain America is fucking awesome.
575155	578238	Because he throws the shield and it bounces off the walls while you beat other stuff up.
578278	581201	And then right when they're about to hit you, it bounces them in the head.
581261	584464	I see you remember it was kind of that way in an old arcade game.
584504	588188	Didn't they have an old arcade Marvel game that you could play that was very similar?
588208	589369	Yeah, there was the Avengers game.
589389	591952	It was just one of those little side-scrolling games.
591972	592252	Right, right.
593059	594119	I seem to remember S.H.I.E.L.D.
594159	595760	kind of did the same thing where it bounced around.
595820	596880	Dude, Captain America's awesome.
597160	597620	That's cool.
597801	599761	I have a mild obsession with Captain America right now.
600121	602642	And yes, SSJ100, Matt and his Marvel does rock.
603422	608024	Except I've decided that who rocks more than she does in that game is Spider-Woman.
609204	615766	For those that maybe don't follow comic books as heavily as you do, because I know you're a bit of a comic fangirl, but maybe, you know, I...
616556	617457	Thanks for watching!
629795	638337	I don't think you have to really follow, I mean, there's so much fun fan stuff thrown in that I think it's really great, but I don't think you really need to be a big fan of, you know, Marvel Comics to get into the game.
638757	652500	It does follow the established Marvel Universe, although for some weird reason, like a couple of the characters are in their Ultimate costumes, but I quickly went and changed all of them back to their regular Universe ones, but it was pretty cool.
653321	655201	That has Nick Fury in it, and he's awesome.
655999	656620	DC Comics Superman
681621	682482	Batman, too, right?
682502	682862	Batman.
683843	688165	I love the X-Men and I love the Avengers, except for Iron Man because he's an asshole right now.
688786	690087	But I really like Captain America.
690767	691067	All right.
691628	691888	Let's see.
691908	693769	I'm looking at chat room to see some other comics here.
695951	698132	Some folks in there are explaining their gaming week.
698672	701374	Of course, I see Brad saying DC Universe beats Marvel every day.
701454	701775	Uh-oh.
703616	704256	What else is there?
705417	706618	Some folks have been playing Crackdown.
706638	708339	Sounds like a lot of people playing Crackdown this week.
708953	709554	Tiger Claw X-Men Arcade
726084	727065	I walked off the screen, aww
754912	758794	Alright, I'm assuming DarkSakura is done, so Loki, how was your gaming week?
759074	759914	It was fun.
760894	762655	I played Crackdown a lot.
762795	766837	I've actually finished the game, but I'm getting those last few achievements.
766877	771679	Like, I have everything maxed out except for firearms now, so I just have to max that out.
772279	775060	I'm already at level 4 on it, but just, you know, almost there.
775540	780122	And then I have to get the rest of the orbs and hidden orbs and all that stuff.
780162	783984	So I'm just working on the last few achievements, but I'm done with the game, so yay.
784004	784084	Okay.
784628	786829	And then, what else?
786909	788249	Oh, I played DDR Universe.
788429	789029	And that was okay.
789249	790509	It's good for DDR, I guess.
790629	794911	But I got really uninterested after a while.
794931	796671	It took forever to unlock stuff.
796711	799031	And it's kind of just, eh, don't care.
800152	801392	I really hate quest mode.
801412	802212	I think it's retarded.
802912	806193	And, yeah, the challenge mode is kind of cool.
806353	808754	I really wish it was stuck with, like, the...
809813	813034	Interstellar Master Mode Bullet Witch Everything bad you've heard about that game is true.
813074	813514	It sucks balls.
831587	832228	It's really that bad.
832408	833749	What exactly do you do in Bullet Witch?
833789	834869	I've seen it, but I don't know much about it.
834890	836611	Bullet Witch, you just go around killing things.
837231	838973	But the thing that sucks about it... Like murder.
839313	846598	Okay, well, murder is good, but the game itself, there's no lock-on for anything, and the enemies are really fucking easy.
846838	855745	But then again, like I said, to be fair, I've only played it for a short amount of time, so I haven't really given it a fair shake yet, but from what I've seen so far, it doesn't look good.
855825	859868	It looks like a game that was like first-gen PlayStation 2 or something.
860008	860829	Just really...
862631	867153	I don't know, it just didn't feel very cool or anything, but, you know, whatever.
867713	877396	So, gave it a shot, and then I played the Armored Core 4 demo, um, that's out in Japan right now, and that one is awesome, and I can't wait to pick up the full game.
877676	879316	It's a lot faster than Chromehounds.
879356	884678	If you were turned off by Chromehounds, this might be the game for you, because it's a lot faster.
885198	889360	I mean, there's three fucking buttons for, you know, boost in the game, so, I mean, you gotta love that.
890020	890500	And, um,
891465	892105	It's just pretty cool.
892526	892926	I like it.
893326	898610	Although it was in Japanese, so I didn't really know what they wanted me to do, but it was fun blowing up things.
899011	900572	So I'm really looking forward to that.
901572	905375	And... I think that's pretty much all I played this week.
905996	907277	Yeah, lots of Crackdown, though.
907377	910619	I really need to play some co-op so I can get that last co-op achievement.
911900	914342	But, um... Oh, there's some fun things to do in Crackdown.
914362	916603	We were messing around with stuff.
917324	918064	Driving the...
919452	924375	Semi-truck round and just boosting through pedestrians like crazy was fun.
924976	926557	Killing hundreds and hundreds of people.
926857	932701	And you can actually level up your driving pretty fast that way because you end up killing more bad guys than you do the actual pedestrians.
933701	933981	I don't know.
934702	936003	It was fun.
936943	940065	I also played a little bit of Crackdown this week, but not enough to really review the game.
940405	944448	And it's odd because I don't really get into those types of games like Crackdown or Grand Theft Auto.
944468	945969	I mean, they're kind of fun for five minutes, but
946288	949272	When I try to play the story mode, I don't really get into them as much.
949332	959944	So I can't really give the game a fair review yet, but I'm going to force myself to play a little more and try to look at it a little more from the perspective of, well, okay, I realize I'm not a fan of this genre, but what my fans of the genre think of it.
960885	964069	But I'm more excited about getting to play the Halo 3 beta finally, after all.
964930	966672	So I'm looking forward to that as part of Crackdown.
967110	975793	GameTap gave this thing CPR recently and now it's up and running as of I think Valentine's Day or the day after is when they actually launched this so I went on there to check it out very much unlike any other MMO you've ever played in fact I
997114	1005838	I don't even know if it would be fair to call this game an MMO, because if you think this is going to be like a Warcrafty run quest, slash things, kill things, it's totally not like that.
1005938	1008079	You've got to remember, Myst was not like that.
1008179	1008900	Myst was what?
1008960	1018444	It was a puzzle game where you didn't really know what the hell was going on, you just knew you had to do things to unlock the way, and as you explored, you figured out more of the story.
1018744	1020625	So that's exactly what Myst Online is.
1020685	1022246	It's a game of exploration.
1022728	1023469	with other people.
1023849	1030954	And it's kind of weird at first because my brain wasn't really thinking that was what I was getting into, although I should have known better because I played Myst back in the day.
1031255	1032496	But, you know, I'm thinking, oh, it's an MMO.
1032516	1033596	We're going to go around and kill things.
1033696	1034817	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1035077	1035818	It's nothing like that.
1036599	1036739	So.
1037899	1038839	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1066841	1067662	Thanks for watching!
1089232	1091693	Download times are atrocious.
1092193	1098296	I mean, having to patch the game earlier in the week, there was no percentage bar or anything that showed me how long it was.
1098336	1100156	I swear, the game took like an hour to patch.
1100597	1109340	Additionally, when you try to access new areas in-game, it takes a long time to load up the new areas of the game, because sometimes it's like you're downloading them before you even go there.
1109360	1115082	And I understand it's trying to download the world to my computer, but I kind of wish there was a little more forewarning or something.
1115182	1116623	I literally had to wait like 30 minutes before
1117025	1123207	for some new area to download, and I just bounced, like, from five, from spending, like, only five minutes in another place.
1123247	1128529	I was just kind of exploring, walking around, then suddenly, bam, I gotta wait 30 minutes with no real warning.
1129049	1130709	So the load times in the game I was not a fan of.
1132030	1139953	I do think, though, back to the positives, I think if you're the type of person that gets sucked into those, like, reality gaming things, what do they call those things?
1140013	1143514	Like the, uh, Loki, you're into AR, alternate universe games?
1144014	1144414	ARGs?
1145182	1145462	What is that?
1145502	1147244	Alternate Reality Gaming, ARGs.
1147284	1148364	What are some of the popular ones?
1150106	1150786	I don't remember.
1150806	1156911	They had one for... Well, they have one right now for... It's not really an alternate reality game.
1156931	1160573	I guess it's more of a viral site or something, but... Sort of.
1160653	1163416	It's... What was it?
1163456	1166878	The... Primatechpaper.com or something like that.
1166898	1167999	Oh, for like heroes and stuff?
1168039	1168579	Yeah.
1168619	1171622	Okay, well, Myst is kind of something like that, but it's like... I mean, it's...
1172738	1175480	I love bees.
1175600	1177321	Actually, that might be a more viral site.
1177741	1183444	Myst Online really takes it to the next level because there are sites that are supposedly made by people in the cavern.
1183704	1194990	I think if you're into role-playing a little bit, you'd really be into it because there's people that play IC in cavern, like they pretend that they really are in the cavern, and they really are exploring these worlds and kind of talk with that perspective.
1195170	1198692	And there's people that play OOC out of cavern and kind of talk like it's normal.
1198932	1200853	And the Myst Online guides give a real...
1202065	1203706	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1229938	1231798	by interacting with the real life actors.
1232078	1238900	And they do this orientation every hour, Monday through Friday from like, I don't know what it was, like 5 to 10, they do orientations every hour.
1239160	1247481	So I actually went to one, and there was actually a guy there that kind of talked about what the universe was, and like I even, to make sure it wasn't a robot, I threw out a question and he actually answered it.
1247761	1251262	So like there were live people just kind of talking about the game and kind of took you on a tour of the main area.
1251602	1256183	So I mean, if you're really into those like alternate reality things, you're gonna get a kick out of it.
1256783	1257823	But if you are
1258610	1263771	You want a game where you quest, that has an objective, that has set goals and things you do?
1264111	1266152	Myst Online ain't going to be really feeling it for you.
1266212	1271713	And it doesn't seem like you really interact with people a lot in the beginning.
1271793	1273273	I think that's something you kind of work towards.
1273533	1279934	But anyway, if you're a GameTap subscriber, obviously you're already paying for Myst Online, so go in there and look at it.
1280455	1281035	It's worth it.
1281975	1282755	If you're not...
1284071	1285993	Already a subscriber of GameTap.
1286153	1287834	Is it worth it just for Myst Online?
1288275	1288795	I'm not sure.
1288935	1295300	You really need to check out the demo so you can kind of see for yourself what I'm talking about, that it's not your typical type of MMO, and make your decision from there.
1295461	1300685	I still recommend GameTap as a whole because, like, 800-something games for $9.95 a month, I think it's a great service.
1301506	1304388	Sometimes I talk about it so well on the show you'd think I'm on their payroll, but I'm not.
1304408	1305569	I think it's a really great service.
1305969	1308972	So, yeah, if you're a GameTap subscriber, go check it out.
1309272	1312695	If you're out of the country where you don't get GameTap and you're going to have to buy this game separately...
1313447	1313688	DDR Universe
1324073	1327075	For the Xbox 360, there's a lot of very good things about Universe.
1327135	1328776	There's a lot of very bad things about Universe.
1329256	1330997	The Ancestor Revolution Universe, the good things.
1331357	1332838	Song list, great.
1333018	1333798	I love the song list.
1334138	1335519	Graphics, pretty cool.
1335819	1337380	A little bit vibrant.
1337400	1340722	I had to turn them down because they were a little too colorful, but the videos are very well done.
1340762	1341222	They're vibrant.
1341262	1344164	Obviously, the game is in HD, which gives the game a whole new look.
1344204	1344864	It's very cool.
1345364	1346085	Things I didn't like.
1346545	1348626	Quest Mode, Quest Mode, Quest Mode.
1348646	1350246	That mode is atrocious.
1350787	1353928	It's the worst thing to ever happen to DDR since True Kiss Destination.
1354348	1354988	Seriously.
1355588	1356389	It's awful.
1356909	1358469	It is so awful.
1358549	1359630	I can't even explain it.
1359730	1360150	It is like...
1361083	1386174	and there's no questing to it it's just it's like you go to a city and you fucking oh we need to get some fame play songs over and over and over there's no explanation it's poorly done it's basically the same five challenges over and over and they have to unlock things through this mode as a joke so if you're thinking that oh I'm gonna get a thousand easy points from DDR universe no you'll get about 400 from playing just just play each song once
1386550	1388751	but quest mode, it's not even worth it.
1388851	1391312	Seriously, wait and see if an unlock code is released.
1391332	1394574	Like remember Ultramix 2, like an unlock code came out later that would give you all the unlocks?
1394814	1395475	Just wait for that.
1395855	1396635	See if something happens.
1396675	1399577	I don't know if there is one or not, but hopefully there is because quest mode sucks.
1400177	1401077	It's just not even worth it.
1401418	1416205	So, in other words, if you are buying this game as a single player who likes all that extra stuff inside DDR, the game itself is really solid, like the songs and the steps and everything, but if you're buying this for quest mode or
1417232	1419794	Xbox Live, which basically has all the modes we've seen before.
1419975	1421336	I don't think there's really a whole lot else.
1421416	1422737	Let me put it this way.
1422777	1426860	If you're contemplating upgrading to Xbox 360 just for DDR, don't.
1430452	1458214	DDR is a very unique game and I think it's something you should check out and they made it very beginner friendly which I think is cool and other good things I should say about it real quick other good things is that you know again it's very beginner friendly it does have like the jukebox mode and the edit step and video mode which is kind of neat and again the song list is great the downloads are pretty cool yes they're already on the disc but honestly some of the ultra mixes were done the same way it's you know something extra it's not essential to the gameplay but
1458761	1462403	and the basic game itself is fine.
1463724	1470508	But again, some of those other things like just the fact that the frame rate is still a little buggy.
1471048	1474950	I swear to God, Cowboy Emmy has her head on backwards when you play in certain songs.
1475150	1475951	Check it out for yourself.
1475991	1476611	I'm not joking.
1478672	1482634	For a DDR hardcore fan, there's going to be some things in here that really irk you.
1483014	1485036	Here's my thing that pissed me off, and I don't know if you noticed it.
1485276	1487557	Did you have trouble playing on a controller?
1488322	1489903	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1517506	1518226	Which is stupid.
1519006	1519366	I don't know.
1520747	1521027	Alright.
1521407	1522727	So, you know, I don't know.
1523207	1528869	Again, I do think DDR Universe is a good DDR game because essentially, what does DDR end up being?
1529049	1530649	It's all about the songs and the steps.
1530869	1534230	And DDR delivers on some awesome songs and great steps.
1534530	1536651	But the other stuff kind of built around it?
1537571	1538131	Not so great.
1538471	1540292	And I really hope they patch it up with Universe 2.
1541076	1543678	LankyStyle, do you want to be on the radio tonight?
1543698	1543758	No.
1568686	1570927	Okay, well, tell us about your gaming week anyway, because you're here.
1571547	1573248	With your freshly shaved head, I notice.
1573508	1574429	Oh, yeah.
1574509	1575149	What's that about?
1575589	1577570	I just, I, Britney Spears.
1577590	1578650	Oh, I was going to say Britney Spears.
1578670	1580471	Britney Spears did it, and I love her.
1581692	1582712	I want to do the spider with her.
1583032	1583292	Alright.
1584413	1585914	Anyhow, let's not explain what that is.
1586234	1586974	How was your gaming week?
1587834	1589115	Um, pretty good.
1589275	1596918	I've been playing Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy VI for the GBA, and just dual wielding the Final Fantasies, because that's what I do.
1597839	1598219	And, uh,
1599039	1599479	Good times.
1600340	1602441	Don't have any of the new systems because I'm old school.
1603822	1606404	But I did play DR Universe, which is pretty cool.
1606785	1612929	I like the license tracks on it, but the old school tracks that they pulled back, that they brought back, I don't know.
1613269	1614730	I don't think it was the best selection.
1614770	1617933	Well, they've kind of already pulled a lot back in the other Xbox games, right?
1618033	1618573	Yeah.
1618593	1620515	So they kind of, you know, they didn't want to repeat, so.
1620795	1621215	That's true.
1621235	1623777	I thought it was kind of cool they got Hot Limit back.
1624437	1625678	Eh, gay.
1627780	1628020	All right.
1629272	1633495	Let's see, going to chat, I'm trying to see what's being talked about previously there.
1634535	1641119	Most people were kind of taken back by the True Kiss Destination, or True Kiss TKD reference I made earlier in the show.
1642139	1645541	And then somebody had to explain the DDR games that only came out in Japan.
1647802	1651264	Let's see, it looks like there's controversy brewing over Rondo of Blood in chat.
1653745	1654706	Alright, let's see.
1655236	1657859	Firebomb wants to know, why do I keep hearing aim noises in the background?
1657879	1660121	Because Jamie's chatting while the show's going on.
1662063	1662824	You got busted.
1663605	1669231	I always have it open just like for only one person who is listening to the show, by the way.
1670012	1672014	So I can keep in touch with Tiara.
1672034	1672174	Gotcha.
1672475	1672755	Gotcha.
1673820	1677762	Alrighty, well, now that we've gone over all our gaming weeks, we're going to start getting into some gaming news.
1677802	1679522	But first, some housekeeping.
1680403	1681063	Housekeeping this week.
1681083	1687766	First off, we want to say a big thank you and hug, hug, kiss, kiss to PSP Fanboy, who profiled us on their site this week.
1688766	1693228	They, you know, posted like, hey, this is a cool show that you should download.
1693428	1694709	I think it's called RSS This.
1695242	1695762	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1716604	1728288	I have a bad feeling this guy listened to the episode where if you go back a couple episodes, DarkSakura and Chris were making those jokes back at each other where DarkSakura and Chris were joking that they were going to go off and have sex.
1731049	1732169	So that made me kind of laugh.
1732749	1735630	So I replied and I was like, actually, she's married.
1735670	1736611	You may not have caught that.
1736651	1740912	You may have downloaded the show where she was flirting with lesbians.
1741232	1745434	But she's just a cool girl who doesn't really – sexuality is whatever.
1745934	1746114	So –
1747641	1748062	There you go.
1748562	1752003	So they corrected the thing, but they still liked the show.
1753004	1753584	I like boobs.
1754064	1755365	I know.
1755385	1756245	You're cool.
1756805	1757125	Whatever.
1758726	1764068	I think what it boils down to, it's not that you're necessarily straight or you're a lesbian.
1764288	1765008	You're just a slut.
1765509	1766009	No, I'm not.
1766149	1766749	I'm just kidding.
1766789	1767129	You're not.
1767269	1769310	I've only slept with one person ever.
1769770	1770051	I know.
1770431	1771611	I'm saying this right now.
1771691	1773532	I'm in a monogamous relationship.
1774133	1777077	with my very first and only Soha.
1777518	1779220	And you still can look at boobs.
1779240	1779981	There's nothing wrong with that.
1780001	1781423	Because boobs are hot and squishy.
1781563	1782305	There you go.
1784407	1784668	All right.
1785068	1787031	Also, a couple other quick housekeeping things.
1787712	1791177	I want to point out over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com and our forums.
1791573	1794297	We've opened up our feedback threads a little early now.
1794617	1805231	So that way, those of you guys that are listening live, A, if you're too chicken to join the chat room at chat.orange.radio.com, you can post in our forum your live feedback as the show is going.
1805571	1808996	And also, it's a good way for folks that are listening live if they're in a chat room.
1809364	1814186	If they had a favorite topic or quote or some funny moment that they wanted to document, that can go in the thread.
1814206	1821348	And that's really good in helping us to write our synopsis, what you guys liked, because then we kind of know what to feature in the show because you guys say you liked it.
1821408	1822488	So just a little thing there.
1823468	1824649	Also, we want to mention this.
1824789	1829790	This doesn't directly have to do with us, but we're kind of throwing our support behind it, shall we say.
1830991	1835412	Obviously, if you didn't already know, Orange Lounge Radio is rebroadcast on a network called All Games.
1835802	1837702	All games is trying to build this community type thing.
1863458	1868802	It's kind of like Myspace, but without the suck.
1869082	1873024	Because Myspace is as nice as it is, and you get a lot of attention there and everything.
1873344	1882590	The problem with Myspace is that, I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting all these cam girls and sluts and hey, cam guys and everything that are trying to add me on there.
1882690	1886893	And you have to filter out all this spam and crap to get through Myspace.
1887549	1895095	So I guess all games found this other service called Ning that allows you to create your own social network without all the freaking ads and all that stuff.
1895475	1896276	And that's pretty cool.
1896296	1902660	You can have your own blog on there and talk about stuff and then the blogs go to the front page and you can add your own videos and all that stuff.
1902680	1903401	So it's pretty cool.
1903905	1904565	www.comunity.allgames.com
1922699	1924280	I think that's it for housekeeping.
1951605	1953326	We will get into some game news now.
1953946	1955027	Who's starting us off tonight?
1956067	1957868	I do believe that would be me.
1958608	1959269	Congratulations.
1959529	1965051	Well, for all five of us who have PlayStation 3s, we have something to look forward to.
1965492	1976157	The firmware is being updated to 1.54 that will add a video chat feature so that we can, I guess, watch naked people and sweaty fanboys on the other side.
1976217	1979018	But if it's our screen format, hey, that'd be great.
1981099	1998272	and if you've also, this of course is more going to go toward any of the UK listeners, but if you've imported your PS3, you'd go into the system menu and update via the internet or you can download the firmware from the US or Japanese support sites.
2000213	2001834	We actually have to pay 20 bucks for it.
2003275	2009179	I'm sorry, 20 bucks for Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection over in the UK, that would be $6.99.
2011369	2015312	and, um, that's really the only differences I'm seeing coming up with that.
2015693	2016914	I didn't download that either.
2017494	2023059	I was like, eh, no, 20, 20 some dollars is too much for me to pay for a game.
2024280	2025160	Well, wait a minute.
2025180	2026021	That you download.
2026041	2032426	I was going to say, you paid like 60 bucks for, yeah, but there's a big difference between like Tekken and Dig Dug.
2032606	2034328	I'm also not a, I'm not a Tekken fan.
2035528	2036168	I would download it.
2036188	2038890	I'm not really a fighting game fan either.
2038910	2045074	I don't think Tekken is worth $600, which is essentially what you're going to try to sell me on because I still don't have a PlayStation 3.
2045895	2048276	And Flow, I still haven't gotten Flow.
2048296	2049917	It's like, I have trouble paying $8.
2049978	2051559	Oh, you mean After Dark, the game?
2052099	2052840	Yeah, exactly.
2053340	2054761	They should put toasters in there.
2054821	2055762	That'd be even better.
2055882	2056342	That'd be fun.
2057311	2058272	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2080051	2082732	and put it on Xbox Live Market... Whoops.
2083052	2084593	PlayStation Network.
2085033	2086094	See where my mind goes?
2086214	2088215	I don't even realize there's a PlayStation Network.
2088495	2089756	So I have Lasers 3.
2090196	2093197	Well, if Xbox beats them to it, that's the nail in Sony's coffin.
2093838	2095318	So there you go.
2095398	2096159	It's a race now.
2096219	2097479	This is the real Next Gen Wars.
2097760	2100081	Who will obtain Laser Cats the game?
2100121	2103022	Because that will be the victor of the Next Gen Wars.
2103402	2107985	Now, not necessarily adding lasers to cats is a good idea.
2108025	2108885	I mean, for example...
2109465	2110646	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2137324	2140507	Future updates getting some upscaling for your DVDs.
2140787	2150174	Now, this is I think a feature that's already on the Xbox 360 and it's already on Blu-ray players out there.
2150194	2153777	At least some of the Sony ones and I think some of the other ones out there.
2155338	2157860	But that's something that's going to be coming later on.
2158000	2158941	Of course, you know...
2161289	2163070	Normal DVDs upscaled look pretty good.
2163350	2167972	Not exactly going to be as great as content that was made for that resolution.
2168532	2170233	But, hey, something's better than nothing.
2170333	2172694	I'd rather have my DVDs look a little bit better.
2174655	2175195	Hooray!
2175375	2177856	Something that's in the update other than video chat, because guess what?
2177956	2182398	I don't have any friends on the PlayStation Network, so video chat is kind of useless to me.
2182418	2184039	You have no friends on the PlayStation Network?
2184059	2185779	Okay, I have Bobby on there, and that's about it.
2185879	2187940	That is the only friend on my friends list.
2188120	2189661	Oh, Bobby's your only friend?
2191066	2195809	and I don't even play online, really, with the PS3.
2196029	2199991	I've never played Resistance online, which I really need to do because it's supposed to be pretty good.
2200391	2208656	And then Motorstorm, which this week we're going to have that, and maybe I'll play that online, but Motorstorm is not two-player split-screen.
2208876	2209816	That fucking sucks.
2210437	2212778	Why the hell can't they do split-screen games anymore?
2213556	2215037	Is it just too graphic intensive?
2215057	2218600	Because you're essentially having to render the two things at once.
2218780	2221562	Well, I would think that the cell processor could handle that.
2221762	2222463	I don't know.
2222483	2223343	I mean, shit.
2223924	2226606	It should be able to reconstruct my DNA.
2226806	2228887	I mean, the cell is awesome, right?
2229688	2231869	Anyways, so upscaling DVDs.
2232750	2235012	I think the cell processor should be able to do that.
2236232	2236573	Hopefully.
2237814	2238114	All right.
2239034	2239415	Let's see.
2239535	2242397	Going on to the chat room and kind of looking at what's going on in chat.
2243339	2243739	Let's see.
2244619	2247080	TheRobD was correcting me from earlier and said it's actually not $600.
2247980	2250400	It's $599 US dollars.
2251000	2254161	Oh, sorry, but you forgot tax and all that other crap they throw in there.
2254181	2254161	$599.99.
2255101	2256001	Yeah.
2256061	2256481	Let's see.
2257101	2258902	HolyShonen says, Aw, poor Loki.
2258962	2260182	Bobby, his only friend.
2260562	2263463	And Rama says, Loki is the Charlie Brown of Orange Lounge Radio.
2263483	2268423	Did you want to give out your username so that other listeners can take pity on you and you can have more than one friend?
2268583	2270324	It's just Loki space O-L-R.
2270724	2271244	Oh, there you go.
2271324	2271464	On the
2272783	2276564	I don't think it's just no one has PlayStation 3s.
2276664	2277304	I have one.
2277704	2279525	Why aren't you guys friends?
2279985	2282126	Because you don't like Loki?
2282166	2284066	Because she doesn't play her PlayStation 3.
2284146	2284826	Because I do.
2284866	2285947	I played it all day today.
2286467	2287967	I sold one of my PlayStation 3 games.
2288007	2289208	I sold Full Auto 2 finally.
2289248	2292248	I'm still keeping Ridge Racer 7 just for the fuck of it.
2292268	2293489	Because it's Ridge Racer.
2293789	2294389	Exactly.
2295149	2298310	It's Ridge Racer 6 in new packaging for the PlayStation 3.
2300351	2301651	I'm not buying Ridge Racer 8.
2303068	2304089	Hear me now, Namco.
2304310	2312538	You need to change more than just... Look, the cars are a little bit more shiny, and the tracks are a little bit more shiny.
2312618	2317302	What if Ridge Racer 8 allowed you to select Toons as the driving cat as a driver?
2317442	2318884	Would you then buy Ridge Racer 8?
2319244	2319765	No, I wouldn't.
2320966	2324850	Although, if Ridge Racer 8 had tons of sluts everywhere, then maybe.
2325610	2326171	That's what they'd need.
2326618	2328038	I wasn't rolling my eyes, I was popping my neck
2347971	2349732	I'm telling you, this is what they need.
2349932	2352134	Because Ridge Racer, it doesn't really stand out.
2352254	2352814	And you know what?
2353394	2358097	Need for Speed and fucking Juiced and stuff are kind of getting a little bit better.
2359218	2362880	But seriously, more women could never hurt.
2365682	2368584	Well, I don't know if there'd be anything in that for me.
2369464	2369784	Who cares?
2369804	2370605	You don't play Ridge Racer.
2371841	2373643	Fireboma says Ridge Racer ate sluts everywhere
2399389	2401651	Alpha Canogram gives the mandatory LOL sluts.
2402993	2405716	GS68 says Ridge Racer Extreme Beach Volleyball.
2406196	2406576	There you go.
2406977	2410320	And Bobby Blackwolf just joined chat going, did someone say my name?
2412583	2417888	To which Rob D promptly responded, it's Loki's only friend, Blackwolf.
2424798	2429499	Are you going to put the patent down on this Ridge Racer 8?
2430439	2433320	No, because they'll never do it.
2434320	2441202	They're still making weird... They still think that fucking Peanuts is a valuable franchise to them.
2441262	2442182	I mean, come on.
2446363	2447763	Actually, I wanted to pull up here.
2447883	2452364	I actually have... I overheard Blackwolf and...
2453254	2457917	Loki talking earlier, and I actually found the theme song of their relationship, so here it is.
2459858	2463379	Haven't you ever heard this song in your life?
2463560	2464140	Never mind.
2464280	2464720	Okay.
2464820	2466061	Joke gone wrong.
2480833	2487795	Also something that went way wrong earlier this week was the relationship between Kotaku and Sony.
2487855	2493397	Surely if you've been anywhere on the internet this week on game blogs you've heard about this whole fiasco.
2493797	2502499	Basically Kotaku published this rumor and the rumor is that PlayStation is going to be unveiling the PlayStation Home at Game Developers Conference.
2503909	2508913	Basically, you get to make an avatar for your console, like a Mii, and this avatar has a room.
2509353	2515718	As you play games and accomplish certain tasks, you will receive items with which to adorn the room that are specific to the game.
2515818	2516318	Achievements.
2516719	2520142	The kicker is that this is going to be a new requirement for every PlayStation 3 game.
2521102	2521502	Awesome!
2521742	2523463	PlayStation is doing something right.
2523703	2527785	They are ripping off some of the best parts of Nintendo and Microsoft, which is what they need to do.
2527945	2528526	That's fine.
2528646	2529766	Everybody rips each other off.
2530006	2532548	They're ripping off the Wii's and Animal Crossing from Nintendo.
2532828	2537910	They're ripping off the achievements from Xbox 360 and making a more dynamic online service to compete with them.
2538390	2538771	Great!
2539031	2540331	This sounds like a wonderful thing.
2540612	2542172	Certainly this couldn't be bad press.
2542392	2544093	This is good news for Sony for once.
2544453	2545354	And what does Sony do?
2545854	2547615	They fuck it up with bad press.
2548311	2559871	because suddenly, like, not even five minutes after this rumor goes up, Kotaku gets this huge, you done fucked up letter from Sony, essentially, and so many, I don't have the letter in front of me, but essentially it said,
2560700	2570423	You're a bad person for running that story, therefore you're uninvited from our press conferences, we want you to send the dev kit back, we're slapping you on the wrist, blah blah blah.
2570503	2579267	It is the equivalent of playing Monopoly with somebody who's losing, and they throw the board up in the air and say, fuck this game, I'm taking my board home.
2580407	2581767	That's basically what happened, yes?
2581827	2582288	Fair to say?
2583248	2588830	Yeah, and they're worried about negative press from the story, and yet...
2590282	2596104	So, this catches wildfire, you know, because everybody's like, what the hell did Kotaku do wrong?
2596424	2602746	Not only did they pretty much prove this rumor to be true, I mean, come on, is there any way this rumor could not be true?
2602866	2606547	Well, that and the fact that they've also registered trademarks for PlayStation Homes.
2611178	2614561	All they had to do was just... We do not comment on rumors.
2614641	2619706	If Sony had kept their mouths shut, they could have still had somewhat of a surprise at Game Developers Conference.
2619967	2625813	But from this happening, did they not think, oh, well, if we're gonna, you know, slap Kotaku's wrist...
2626223	2629605	Don't you think they're probably going to blog about it since obviously Sony doesn't care about them anymore?
2629865	2632286	Well, here's the other thing that I think is kind of bad.
2632446	2633587	Let me say real quick.
2633967	2637189	Obviously the rest of the story is the rest of the internet banded behind Kotaku.
2637589	2638489	It got on Dig.
2638809	2645653	Even other blogs like Destructoid changed their title banner to basically say like Brian Crescente has the biggest balls in the world, something like that.
2646834	2655378	The entire internet's jumping behind what Kotaku did and Sony got its tail between its legs now, has to go
2656118	2657679	Oh, we made a mistake.
2657739	2659140	Kotaku, can we play nice again?
2659801	2661042	And they made up.
2661082	2661802	They kissed and made up.
2662022	2663163	Well, here's the whole thing.
2663203	2665605	The big focus wasn't about this whole story.
2665785	2673531	It was that Sony was trying to dictate to a blog what stories they could post and what they can't.
2673811	2675032	They're reporting on stuff.
2675092	2675512	It's not...
2676397	2676937	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2696147	2697448	didn't quite go their way.
2697608	2703511	You know, they thought, oh, big bad Sony's going to make a huff and puff and they're going to just be like, oh, okay, we'll take the story down then.
2704291	2708314	Ranma says, Sky, the whole Kotaku Sony thing was a damn publicity stunt.
2709114	2709534	What do you think?
2709995	2710295	No.
2710715	2712156	Where's the evidence to back that up?
2712256	2712676	I don't know.
2712836	2713857	It's not publicity.
2713977	2715818	I think it was just being stupid.
2715978	2722621	Why wouldn't Sony use their own, what is it, three, three something, what is that, three, that site they have.
2722681	2723282	It's called like 3D.
2725242	2727424	I keep thinking of Frogger 2, 3, Deep.
2727544	2728165	I don't know why.
2728445	2729666	But they have... Yes.
2729706	2730107	Please.
2730127	2731408	Blog site's called Frogger 2, 3.
2731929	2733170	Could I have said anything more random?
2733390	2736493	They have some site, 3 something, that shows how much we care.
2736533	2736853	3Play.
2736953	2737294	Thank you.
2737854	2738995	You knew that the whole time.
2739056	2740497	You just wanted to watch me struggle.
2741238	2742519	They had 3Play or whatever.
2742830	2743411	I can't help, I know...
2768719	2769059	I don't know.
2769959	2771760	Great, I guess, that they're doing this.
2771940	2772320	Cool.
2772880	2774701	I'm not going to buy more games, though, because of it.
2774821	2775301	I'm sorry.
2775961	2782163	Microsoft was smart to do the achievements because I'm a sucker and I buy crappy games like Bullet Witch because of this shit.
2782903	2788065	And no matter how hard I try, I can't do that because I'm hooked like crack.
2788645	2792506	And so, you know, the PlayStation Network or whatever, great.
2792606	2794527	I get crap for my virtual house now.
2795234	2796014	That's awesome.
2796314	2797175	I'll show it to all my friends.
2797335	2797715	Oh, wait.
2798015	2800956	Bobby is my only friend on there, so great.
2801016	2802116	That's going to be awesome.
2802176	2804097	I can't wait to show all my friend.
2804857	2808758	It's just stupid, though.
2809358	2810238	They don't get it.
2810398	2818281	It's not because people are not buying a PlayStation 3 or going on their network service because there's no achievements or me's.
2818541	2823082	It's because of $600, not because there's no me's.
2823780	2827966	I didn't go, oh wow, you know, there's me's on here now.
2828206	2830169	I guess I'll spend $600 on a PlayStation 3.
2830950	2834114	No, that's not the reason why people aren't buying your platform.
2835196	2836598	Jamie, you want to chime in?
2837679	2838921	I like Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2840620	2844283	What if, let's say, PlayStation puts out a patch.
2844403	2846345	They actually do have an online version on that, by the way.
2846685	2850287	Let's say PlayStation comes out with a patch and all the old games get this too.
2850408	2854911	Because there's relatively enough games out there where they could go back to all the old games and patch them.
2855371	2858814	And let's say you could get a Captain America shield in your house from playing.
2859074	2860255	Would that be cool?
2860785	2861405	Yes, it would.
2862485	2867307	But is that enough to be like a real robust feature that could sell the PlayStation 3?
2867407	2869187	It's like, hey, come over to my house.
2869407	2871348	I've got a Captain America shield.
2871408	2873908	My answer time.
2873988	2875849	It would be a, hey, come over to my house.
2875909	2877169	I have a Captain America shield in it.
2877829	2888552	If it were like something where the whole environment was very like Animal Crossing where you can walk around and talk to people like this big online chat room almost with avatars.
2889073	2889993	That would be kind of cool.
2890013	2890374	Which it could be.
2890514	2893215	Keep in mind, it hasn't been officially announced yet.
2893235	2896636	If it was Browser the MMO or something, then that would be one.
2896976	2898337	I don't think it's enough to sell the system.
2898577	2910182	That's exactly what I think, is that I don't think it's $600 cool, but Sony badly needs something cute like this to kind of help their image, if that makes any sense.
2910563	2912884	Like, they really need something like this.
2912965	2914425	But again, it boils down to the games.
2914586	2921810	Well, they need something also to flesh out their network because right now their network's just kind of a clusterfuck of I don't know what's going on, you know?
2921970	2925833	I mean, there's no downloadable content for the games.
2926093	2928454	There's hardly any demos online.
2928534	2931416	There's hardly any download content other than PlayStation 1 games.
2931896	2932417	Great!
2932477	2933357	PlayStation 1 games.
2933477	2935859	I need a PS3 to download games to my PSP.
2936179	2939141	Which, by the way, people have broke already so you can, you know...
2940171	2943853	Copy them and completely pirate the shit.
2943913	2948917	But it's like there's no motivation for me to go online with this thing.
2950298	2950598	At all.
2950918	2952999	I mean, I'm sorry.
2953039	2955341	There's just... Motorstorm's going to be a great game.
2955561	2955821	Great.
2955981	2961184	I feel like I should buy a PlayStation 3 just to be your friend and take pity on you.
2961565	2961865	I just...
2962273	2963993	I feel so bad for you and you're my friend.
2964013	2964073	Why?
2964314	2965474	I don't play my PlayStation 3.
2965794	2969535	I play my 360 and I've been playing the Wii a little bit, but mainly my 360.
2970095	2974916	And there was a time when I was playing Resistance, I'm like, well, I don't know when am I going to go back and play my 360.
2974956	2979197	Well, it didn't take long, finished Resistance, and then there's no reason to play it anymore.
2979297	2985679	So now I'm back to playing my 360 where there's a bunch of new shit coming out, which is great, you know, but...
2986328	2989171	PlayStation 3 doesn't have anything really unique to it.
2989471	2990192	It's everything.
2990452	2994036	If I'm going to get a game, I'm going to get it on the 360 because it has achievements.
2995057	2996659	Black Wolf's getting a little territorial.
2996699	2999001	Black Wolf says, no, Sky, he's my friend.
2999302	3000423	You stay back, bitch.
3002785	3003866	You can add me and Dan.
3003886	3005188	We're on there as Gunstar Hero.
3005208	3009092	Cue the scary music theme, single white female, whatever.
3009642	3015105	All right, so definitely something that will continue to develop next week at Game Developers Conference when they actually announce it.
3015185	3017446	Oh, wait, sorry, it's supposed to be a rumor, but come on.
3017886	3019107	We all know it's probably true.
3019307	3019927	It is true.
3019987	3022369	They've already registered the fucking trademarks for it.
3022389	3023509	They got a logo for it.
3024089	3025130	It's coming out.
3025570	3032994	They just didn't want it to look like that this was something that they thought up real quick or anything like, I don't know, the six-axis controller.
3034123	3061618	What I want to know We always meant for that to have tilt control It wasn't like after we saw the Wii or anything that we decided to put this in here Could someone going to Game Developers Conference randomly shout out I love you Kotaku during the Sony press conference like after or before when everybody's coming in I would do it myself but I'm afraid of getting kicked out So I need someone with bigger balls I can't even go so I didn't get invited You can just go Is it free?
3062158	3063119	Well if you're a press, yes
3064408	3065589	I think you'd have to register, though.
3065949	3066809	You can do it at the thing.
3067930	3069731	You can't do that.
3069891	3070911	Anyway, I'll talk to you offline.
3071231	3074953	All right, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.
3075493	3078634	Well, there is a little bit more from Sony.
3078835	3084097	They have their launch lineup for the European PlayStation Network.
3085635	3114362	there will be a few downloads available on March 23rd Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection for £6.99 Blast Factor for £3.49 and Gran Turismo HD Trial for free other games that are set to come out is on the 30th Super Rub-a-Dub which is a duck 6th April Flow, 13th April Go Sudoku and 20th April Go Puzzle so there's just a few things
3115537	3128967	Have you noticed that a lot of their games that they make for the online network that use 6-axis tilt controls are just games where it's involving you shooting something or something in water that you tilt the thing around.
3128987	3133570	The only thing that the 6-axis is good for is fucking Etch-a-Sketch shit.
3134590	3135871	For the record, I hate the 6-axis.
3136532	3137913	Actually... I hate it.
3138313	3138613	Why?
3139774	3144157	Because you had to do shit with it on Marvel Ultimate Alliance and it's so fucking unwieldy.
3144938	3145919	It just isn't annoyance.
3146359	3152243	Actually, that would be kind of funny as an extra sketch because you could use the analog sticks and the dials and then you could shake the controller to clear it.
3153024	3153324	I don't know.
3153524	3157107	They should make downloadable... But what if I had Parkinson's and I'd never be able to draw anything?
3157447	3159408	Well, I don't know.
3160029	3160869	Don't buy that then.
3161710	3162270	Don't buy a Wii.
3162310	3163271	Buy a 360 then.
3163431	3164232	Alright, I will.
3164352	3165973	And where the 360 will rumble for you.
3167534	3168735	Anyways, so...
3170558	3170938	and DarkSakura.
3195305	3195805	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3224764	3233689	I guess, you know, maybe they may announce something at Game Developers Conference, you know, that they're redesigning the PS3 or something like that, so.
3234049	3235089	Now in pretty colors.
3235930	3236430	Oh, yeah.
3237191	3237671	You know what?
3237751	3241293	That might be pretty smart to beat Nintendo to the market with that kind of crap.
3241493	3242373	Beat them at their own game?
3242693	3243294	Yeah, exactly.
3244594	3248817	Well, unless they come out and say, now in pretty colors and $200 cheaper.
3250157	3251138	I don't know if I'm sold yet.
3253059	3253319	Anyhow.
3254137	3258399	Something that might bring some people back to the PlayStation 3, including Hideo Kojima.
3259279	3262820	If you can think back to an old story, I mean, yes, we all know Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming out on 360.
3263180	3267422	I can't get Microsoft out of my mind tonight.
3267442	3267922	What the fuck?
3268282	3271524	Apparently, Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming out on PlayStation 3.
3272784	3274265	But what did Kojima say he missed?
3274605	3275365	Rumble, right?
3275745	3277486	And that was an essential part of Metal Gear Solid.
3277546	3279827	And obviously, Rumble is not on the PlayStation 3.
3279867	3279967	Well...
3281570	3284292	Apparently, Rumble could be coming back.
3285013	3290578	And the reason why we say could be is because Sony and Immersion have settled their patent litigation.
3290938	3292219	Think back in the past.
3292559	3294581	Immersion sued Sony over the Rumble thing.
3294601	3296262	They actually settled with Microsoft.
3296282	3303068	And I believe Nintendo, they either settled or Nintendo had already worked it out with Immersion before they ever put it in there.
3303248	3304549	They worked it out with the other two companies.
3304569	3305770	That's why you have Rumble and the 360 and the Wii.
3306601	3307542	Rumble is so last gen
3325445	3331067	The Edge on the competition, but really, they're just kind of trailing behind in ideas and innovation.
3331508	3331988	This time.
3332448	3334989	Well, this time, I mean, well, all the time.
3335049	3335909	When have they been ahead?
3335949	3338691	I mean, okay, granted, they had a DVD drive and a PlayStation 2.
3339431	3341052	Okay, good for them.
3341212	3342032	I mean, that's good.
3342092	3345173	A lot of stuff on PlayStation 1 and 2 were a little bit ahead of time.
3345193	3348055	They were behind on the fucking, you know, rumble technology.
3348075	3351396	They're behind on analog sticks on there, but...
3352842	3356363	and even the controller designs fucking copying off of the Super Nintendo.
3356423	3358323	So, I don't know.
3358403	3359984	They're just playing the copycat game.
3360384	3362024	Oh, they did it pretty well the last two gens.
3362484	3364005	Well... Alright, well anyway.
3364945	3368406	What makes this whole thing very interesting is what Kaz Hirai had to say after this whole thing.
3368466	3375627	Quote, We look forward to exploring with immersion exciting new ways to bring the largest and best range of gameplay experiences to our customers.
3376008	3382089	We are very excited about our new partnership with immersion and the potential for new and innovative products incorporating their technologies.
3382580	3385161	Great, I gotta buy new controllers now, thank you very much.
3386942	3388003	I hope I can trade them in.
3390484	3392065	Interesting, I guess is all I can say.
3392105	3405551	I mean, not even like three days ago, someone over at Sony, I don't remember who said it, but somebody at Sony said, it was probably that crazy guy from Sony Europe, Phil Harrison, I think he was the one that said, Rumble is so last gen.
3410740	3436683	and now things seem to change on a dime yet again well we do though anything in this industry though does change pretty crazy including release dates however I have a fairly decent list for our UK listeners so starting with the releases on the 5th which would be tomorrow for us actually it's the 5th there already
3437205	3439447	is a Wario Master of Disguise in the DS.
3439927	3462304	Coming up on the 9th is Bullet Witch, Castlevania Portrait of Ruin, Garfield's Nightmare, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, Luminous Plus, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2, March of the Minis, Rogue Galaxy, Runaway 2, The Dream of the Turtle, Silverfall, The Household Detroit Streets, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, and Trackmania United on PC.
3463645	3463805	Cool.
3465088	3492994	we actually have a pretty good week as far as release dates in the United States definitely some good stuff especially one of my favorites coming to the Playstation 2 Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories for the whopping cheap price of $19.99 so you should definitely check it out of course I don't think there's going to be multiplayer in there so that kind of sucks Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 for the 360 and the PC Def Jam Icon for Playstation 3 and the 360 that should be pretty cool
3493815	3505064	Titan Quest Immortal Throne Motor Storm Wario Master of Disguise Rayman's Raving Rabbids Shrek's Smashing Crash Racing Burnout Dominator PlayStation 2 and the PSP Tortuga Two Treasures
3524141	3524541	VIRTUA TENNIS
3553479	3555320	and that's coming out on March the 8th.
3556041	3562166	On some other systems, over on the Nintendo Wii, Bomberman Land Wii is coming out on March 8th.
3562226	3563587	See, this is why I like doing this segment.
3563647	3566729	I didn't even know they were making a freaking Bomberman game for the Wii, so there you have it.
3567030	3569471	Hopefully much better than Bomberman Act Zero.
3570292	3572554	Hopefully they don't take Bomberman into the future.
3573054	3573815	We'll see what happens.
3574535	3580760	A game called iShield 21 from Nintendo is actually coming out over in Japan this week as well.
3580780	3581281	It looks like...
3582295	3584716	It looks like it could be a fighting game or something.
3584736	3585856	I'm not sure exactly what this is.
3587236	3589757	It's actually more of an action game, it looks like.
3590377	3592277	I'm trying to see what some of the screenshots look like.
3592297	3594838	It looks like it has a bunch of different modes in it there.
3594858	3597338	You kick a ball in one mode as a football player.
3598158	3600359	It looks like another one you throw a football.
3600719	3605980	I think it might be an amateur Olympics type of game.
3606800	3607300	So there you have it.
3608400	3610481	Maybe someone in chat will pipe up who knows more about that game.
3610721	3611021	Which one?
3611817	3614039	and it's called Eyeshield 21.
3615119	3618141	It's an anime-based football game, I think.
3618962	3619262	Interesting.
3619302	3620082	If I remember correctly.
3620483	3624725	And it's just like, I guess, Imagine Madden, but with fictional football characters.
3624745	3625245	They're anime.
3626266	3626546	All right.
3627407	3635692	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, you have Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania Masterpiece Gold coming out over in Japan.
3636072	3637753	Used to import all those Guitar Freaks games.
3637773	3638774	Jamie, are you going to get this one?
3639114	3639274	No.
3639294	3639334	No.
3639935	3641036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3661792	3662712	Kenka Banshu 2 Full Throttle Doraemon
3689125	3695669	Doraemon Nobita no Shin Maki Daibouken Dragon Sakura DS EQ Trainer DS Puzzle Series
3711716	3715921	Second Detsetsu Heroes of Mana coming out from Square Enix.
3716402	3719365	And I imagine that would be the next Mana game that we're going to get over here.
3720146	3721568	We're getting Dawn of Mana next.
3722109	3723771	Well, it's probably the same thing, just a different name.
3724251	3729738	That's, of course, speculation from someone who has not done their research on what exactly that game is.
3731155	3731836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3746384	3752986	and that game Spelling Spree which was being released by Ubisoft is now known as Wordplay.
3753546	3756927	So I guess they thought Spelling Spree was retarded as a name.
3757267	3761288	I would like to thank everyone in chatroom who was yelling at me over what Eyeshield 21 is.
3761689	3764849	You all watch far more Japanese import animation than I do.
3765010	3765490	There you have it.
3766350	3767830	It's fucking football, dumbass!
3769311	3769851	My bad.
3772185	3773466	Yeah, Rob, you should know better.
3773907	3775088	Sorry, did you know what it was?
3775268	3776829	Did you say anything to try to correct me?
3777290	3779632	No, I like seeing you flounder.
3779812	3780272	You're a bitch.
3781013	3782014	I know, so.
3782794	3796326	Well, speaking of bitchy things, you know, at least things that are going to have other companies bitching, it has been speculated that the Wii is going to outsell the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 through 2008.
3799747	3811076	The market research firm IDC has basically stated that they believe the hardware shipments of the Wii will capture more than a third of the worldwide market by 2008.
3811477	3815680	And it will rise above the PS3 and Xbox 360.
3816881	3819903	In related news, I still don't give a shit what an analyst has to say.
3821365	3823326	I think it's already proving, though, to be that way.
3823366	3825268	Just, you know, look at how it's performing.
3825668	3827870	I'll give you that, but I get so sick of these
3828380	3830021	Analyst says this.
3830101	3831341	Stories making it to blogs.
3831361	3834522	That's why I'm not talking about any stories with analysts.
3834562	3836343	And it's catching a lot of news and what have you.
3836463	3837363	You're right.
3837383	3840324	The whole reason I thought that it was relevant is because it is happening.
3840404	3841984	It's something that we actually see happening.
3842004	3842564	I'll give you that.
3842584	3845485	Just like we had this week as well.
3845665	3848286	There was another analyst that said that the PlayStation 3 is going to take over by 2010.
3848346	3851207	Then there was another analyst that says the Wii is going to take over.
3851227	3853668	Then there was another analyst that says the 360 is going to take over.
3854147	3855769	We need someone to analyze the analysts.
3855789	3856570	So you know what that means?
3857251	3858472	It's crap information.
3859013	3861055	Your guess is as good as their guess.
3861576	3862838	What do you think about this guess?
3862878	3865261	I actually kind of agree with it.
3865321	3873651	I do think that we will continue to outpace 360 and PlayStation 3 just based on the reactions of people I see who aren't gamers.
3874204	3884410	Again, keep in mind, Cars was one of the top-selling games last year, not thanks to any hardcore gamer who reads the blogs and thinks that that's the whole gaming world right there in that bubble.
3885270	3888672	The casual gamer is what's going to push the Wii, I believe, ahead of those other two systems.
3889693	3890753	I don't think so.
3890913	3895116	I think the 360, there's going to be some great games coming out.
3895216	3896877	It's a little bit slow in the beginning of the year.
3897377	3899718	January, there's Lost Planet coming out, Bell.
3899919	3900359	What was it?
3900439	3902240	January, there's two games for the...
3903638	3907640	3.60, most people were still picking up the Wii's because they couldn't get a hold of them at, you know, launch.
3908480	3915363	And they're just, you know, right now, I think, I think by the end of this year, I still think the 360's going to be beating the crap out of the Wii.
3915523	3918264	But I don't really hear people talking about Lost Planet anymore.
3918284	3918624	Oh, yeah.
3918644	3920705	Yet I still hear people talking about Wii Sports.
3921885	3925266	Well, that's because people are simpletons and they like Wii Sports.
3925967	3926967	You know, big deal.
3927007	3932209	I mean, people are picking up Wii Play not because of Wii Play, but because it came with another controller.
3933169	3935630	Nintendo's just not putting out enough product.
3935990	3942793	And, you know, I had a story here real quick that Nintendo is slow to resupply retailers with brand new Wii's.
3943353	3944614	And I can attest to that.
3944714	3950796	Distribution for the month of March is being cut out of their replenishment cycles.
3950856	3953117	Basically, Nintendo has said, guess what?
3953738	3957019	Distributors out there, you're not getting any new Wii's for the month of March.
3957159	3960521	We're giving them all to retailers because we can't make enough.
3961001	3961341	So...
3962305	3974661	They right now are having a problem with production, and I think they just need to pump out as many systems, but eventually it's going to plateau once all those people that were waiting to get one finally get one.
3974761	3975802	But right now there's...
3976980	3986505	Not that I mean, Super Paper Mario coming out in April, but there's not any real big games announced that have definite dates yet, other than, you know, the fall.
3986545	3988006	So I think it's going to just plateau.
3988026	3992509	Yeah, it's the DS drought all over again, despite what Mr. Fils-Aimé said previously.
3992569	3993129	Yeah, seriously.
3993209	3997411	Mario Party's been delayed to whenever, at least summer.
3997811	4000973	And then, you know, there's really a lot of crappy games coming out.
4000993	4003334	But Zelda Ocarina of Time on Virtual Console.
4003555	4004115	Fap, fap, fap.
4004890	4006171	Oh, goody, great.
4006751	4007371	That's awesome.
4008192	4011293	Virtual console, totally the reason why you should buy a Wii.
4012154	4017857	It's kind of, you have to admit, for some, again, casual gamers, that kind of appeals to them.
4018397	4020959	Well, great, but I don't think it's going to sell systems, though.
4021079	4029203	I think, really, right now, people saw, like, WarioWare, and it was a lot of fun, and they're seeing some of the games coming out probably in March, but...
4030366	4033528	There is going to be a drought, and I think that's going to plateau off.
4033689	4040975	Whereas the 360, if they have as big of a month as they're planning to in May, it's going to keep going.
4041055	4044798	And I think with Game Developer Conference, there's going to be some major announcements.
4046540	4051364	And then eventually, especially with November, we're just going to see it take off again, with Halo 3 especially.
4052125	4053666	So, I don't know.
4055291	4066581	Going back to both these topics here, Gaming Nerd in chat says, By 2010, none of these consoles are going to be good since the next gen will be here and some console will get released a year before the rest.
4067661	4068142	Good point.
4069003	4073266	Let's see, also talking about JV Mon says, Who the fuck cares about Ocarina?
4074167	4078231	Thank you very much because I think Ocarina is one of the most overhyped games ever.
4078451	4079652	I like Ocarina of Time.
4079872	4080813	It's one of my favorite games.
4080953	4081734	I like it.
4082392	4083012	I like it!
4083253	4084233	It's one of my favorite games.
4084513	4091058	You know, there's certain websites out there that review some of these Zelda games, and because it's Zelda, they give it a 10 out of 10.
4092639	4107068	Not saying which websites, but I saw that and rolled my eyes and go, well, I kind of figured you'd do this, seeing as you've got a big hard-on over fucking Twilight Princess, which, I might add, it's a great game, but it's not perfect.
4107188	4109470	I did have a hard-on over Twilight Princess, actually.
4109590	4109990	It wasn't...
4110797	4113840	It wasn't fucking, you know, the greatest thing on Earth.
4114080	4118604	I've seen way better, and... But, actually, it was pretty good.
4120345	4125069	But anyway, no, I don't think... For me, Ocarina was no Link to the Past.
4125330	4126090	That was my problem.
4126210	4129793	Call me a 2D gamer, whatever, but that was my problem, was Ocarina was no Link to the Past.
4130294	4132095	Exactly, so, whatever.
4132756	4134878	Controversial viewpoint, sorry, what can I say?
4135218	4138421	That's what we love to have here on this show, are controversial viewpoints.
4139349	4144190	What we also love on this show are other little bits of retro goodness, and this always makes me squee.
4144510	4149491	And I notice Rice Princess is here joining us now, so say hello to the fanboys and girls.
4149551	4150012	Rice Princess?
4150872	4151312	Hello.
4151932	4152592	How are you doing this week?
4153312	4153993	Kind of tired.
4154673	4155133	Sorry to hear that.
4155153	4156993	You want to nap on the ground there while we do the show?
4157593	4158234	No, it's filthy.
4159134	4159394	All right.
4160706	4173053	I don't know if you remember this game, Rice Princess, but coming to the Wii from System 3, we've talked about this previously on the show, but we have some box art now for Impossible Mission coming out to the Wii.
4173473	4175114	Are you freaking joking?
4175134	4175915	This is awesome.
4176415	4177015	No, I'm not.
4177095	4183299	This is news that just makes you want to shout, ah.
4183559	4185140	It's more like, another visitor.
4185500	4186321	Stay a while.
4186621	4187961	Stay forever.
4188142	4188802	Nobody's going to get that.
4189505	4192628	Anyway, Impossible Mission, if you can believe it, came out 25 years ago.
4192648	4199355	It was one of the first games to use real synthesized speech, such as the type that Rice Princess and I just performed for you guys.
4199795	4201997	Keep in mind, this is not Mission Impossible.
4202097	4203979	This was, I guess you could call it a spoof game.
4204259	4205801	There's some cool little screenshots there.
4205841	4207502	These are from the DS version of the game.
4207903	4208483	But look at that.
4209364	4213008	What they did right with this is the same damn game, just with really pretty graphics.
4213528	4214209	That's pretty cool.
4214844	4240902	and it's also coming out on the PSP you can see PSP, DS and Wii so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen there also what's new to this game there is a new tutorial mode there's also three game modes and three characters to choose from the characters look to be the dude that was in the original game a chick now is that a chick or a guy with long hair actually I can't tell oh no it's a chick and a robot named Gamma what?
4242163	4242904	a robot?
4243284	4244505	that's what it is a robot
4245527	4247108	Anyway, the three game modes you can play.
4247548	4250851	New, original, and of course, the hybrid mode.
4251072	4252693	The original game with the updated graphics.
4253074	4253474	Swoon.
4253774	4257738	Okay, so when you play the robot, does he say, get him, my humans?
4257858	4258959	Like, that doesn't make sense.
4258999	4259720	Why a robot?
4259740	4260260	What the hell?
4261021	4263483	Maybe it's like an android or something.
4263583	4263924	I don't know.
4264304	4266086	Can't you still say, get him, my robots?
4266926	4270870	Because what they do, they shot out little electricity beams, and if you're made of metal, that's probably going to hurt.
4271969	4274390	I don't know, that just seems a little bit shady to me.
4274771	4276391	I don't know if I want this game anymore.
4277112	4281074	You're gonna not buy this game based off the fact you could play as a robot.
4282054	4287177	Yeah, and I could also just play it, like, on the Commodore 64, like it originally was.
4287617	4288778	But new game modes!
4289538	4289878	So?
4289898	4291119	Alright.
4292040	4293260	I'm totally buying it for the Wii.
4293300	4294941	I'm looking forward to this game so much.
4295441	4297683	Did they ever say if this was coming to the US for sure?
4298523	4300224	Because I know this is coming to, um...
4300931	4305695	Europe, and I can see the box art has the Europe ratings on it, but did they ever say they'd confirm this for the U.S.?
4306556	4311060	Well, I know the same company's putting out Elevator Action, and that's coming to the U.S., so it is probably.
4311100	4311581	I hope so.
4312141	4312541	I hope so.
4312622	4315284	System 8 or whatever, we should call them and get an interview.
4315844	4316465	I'm going to do that.
4316745	4317085	System 3?
4317466	4317966	System 3, sorry.
4317986	4319848	I don't know why I thought System 8.
4320088	4325032	System 3, I'm going to call them and try to get an interview, and beg and plead for impossible admission like a sad little fanboy.
4327054	4327294	Well...
4328920	4337065	Speaking of sad little fanboys, but nothing actually having to do with sad little fanboys, guess what is coming out to the Wii, thanks to Vivendi?
4338025	4339106	We are getting Scarface.
4340767	4353154	Which is kind of funny, because with the game that it being, you're actually going to be using the nunchuck to walk, to drive, to walk around, to pilot boats, and you shoot using the Wiimote.
4354082	4358826	and you even have a chainsaw for hand-to-hand combat so you have to wiggle around and all that.
4359846	4368253	But where on the PS2 and Xbox Ones you had to swear to increase your kill factor, you do it by making dirty gestures with your Wiimote.
4369474	4372336	The more you gesture, the more your kill factor goes up.
4372516	4373617	Hot sluts, yes or no?
4374497	4375958	I see nothing regarding hot sluts.
4376038	4377520	There are hot sluts in the game.
4377880	4382023	The game will take place after the final mansion shootout.
4385019	4398365	OMG spoilers oh come on the movie's from 1983 Rob it's basically he doesn't die and he has to instead he has to reclaim his fortune wait he dies at the end?
4399085	4413632	yes he dies at the end of the movie oh great next thing I know you're going to tell me that like freaking Darth Vader is Luke's father or something you're going to tell me like freaking you know the Titanic sinks in that movie I mean what else do you want to ruin for me while you're here
4416035	4417356	I'm sorry, I have to kick somebody out of the chatroom.
4419636	4420557	Is somebody being bad?
4421457	4422678	I don't know, somebody's being punished.
4423378	4431021	I told Nintendo Maniac 64 not to use the, uh, um, the, what you're listening to shit in the chatroom.
4431041	4431841	Oh yeah, that stuff annoys.
4432201	4434942	Yeah, so, uh, next, uh, next time's gonna be a ban, so.
4435002	4435783	Ooh, regulate.
4435903	4436063	Yep.
4436483	4437083	I don't care who it is.
4437663	4438324	We have rules for reasons.
4438344	4439844	What if I'm listening to hot sluts porn?
4441425	4441865	I don't care.
4442811	4444811	No one gives a shit about what anybody else is listening to.
4444831	4446152	You're supposed to be listening to the show.
4448072	4448672	All right, anyhow.
4448892	4450192	Anything else on Scarface you want to add?
4452373	4452533	No.
4452833	4453093	All right.
4453573	4456573	Anyways, speaking of games... Snape kills Tony!
4457914	4467375	Speaking of games on the Wii, there is a trend that we're going to start seeing, much like we did with DS, where companies go, hey, we're making games for the Wii, too.
4467695	4469496	And then you're like, well, what games do you have?
4469596	4471916	And they're like, well, um...
4472677	4474037	Ninja Bread Man
4501767	4504389	Dude, Ninja Bread Man sounds awesome.
4505469	4506790	What are you talking about, crap games?
4506810	4507470	This sounds great.
4507651	4509532	Monster Trucks Extreme.
4509592	4511833	Trucks spelled T-R-U-X, of course.
4514214	4516275	Jamie, isn't that one of your favorite things ever?
4516395	4519317	When they purposefully missed Bratz, B-R-A-T-Z?
4519597	4520317	That's retarded.
4520718	4524520	Oh, it's Monster Trucks Extreme Off-Road Edition.
4524640	4527021	Because I guess the last game was on-road.
4528822	4530343	Is that related to Big Mother Truckers?
4530848	4532129	No, it's probably just a crappy game.
4533249	4537952	Anubis 2, Rock and Roll Adventures.
4537972	4541053	That's like Rock and Roll High School.
4541133	4541773	I'm so there.
4541953	4542434	No, it's not.
4543174	4544335	Hamster Heroes.
4545495	4546996	How can you call these bad games?
4547176	4548116	Hamster Heroes?
4548417	4549437	That sounds amazing.
4550898	4552058	Mini Desktop Racing.
4553439	4555320	These will be the people that put out Laser Cats.
4555919	4561043	Trixie in Toyland, London Taxi Rush Hour, and let's see what else we had here.
4561403	4565587	Billy the Wizard, uh, I can't even read what that said.
4565687	4571271	I think it's like fucking, oh, Rocket Broomstick Racing, and, um,
4572247	4573808	I wanna play Hamster Heroes!
4586448	4587709	Data Design Interactive.
4587729	4588810	Well, we could check out their website.
4588830	4589671	Can you send them an email, Loki?
4589991	4590652	Get in touch with them.
4590672	4591052	I'll send them.
4591072	4594935	Tell them we will promote Hamster Heroes here on the program and Ninja Bread Man.
4595156	4599559	I like hamsters, but, you know, I don't know if that game's going to be any good.
4599579	4600961	Eh, who gives a shit?
4600981	4604724	They're putting out Chicken Shoot on fucking, you know, the Wii.
4605084	4606045	So, you know what?
4606185	4609308	I think it's only fair that they're allowed to put these games out.
4609768	4611330	Just all you have to do...
4612418	4618639	Monster Trucks Extreme, at least better than Monster 4x4 World Circuit, because that game was atrocious.
4619099	4622580	Fireboma says, Rocket Broomstick Racing sounds like Quidditch, but worse.
4623660	4625501	To which somebody else had a follow-up.
4625541	4630722	Speaking of spoilers, because we were talking about spoilers in the last one, GS68 had a comment for DarkSakura.
4631002	4633563	GS68 has figured out who will die in Book 7.
4634683	4636463	Harry and Nintendo Maniac 64.
4637283	4638924	So he posted that spoiler there in chat.
4639384	4639604	Okay.
4641690	4642551	And let's see.
4643291	4647694	Oh, apparently there was a LaserCats 2 on last night on the old Saturday Night Live.
4647754	4649375	It was LaserCats 2.
4649756	4650116	Remember?
4650356	4651717	It was always LaserCats 2.
4652157	4653038	Maybe it was a rerun then.
4653058	4654459	I don't know.
4654639	4655680	Anyway, let's see.
4656420	4657021	What else was there?
4658081	4660463	FireBoma says Rock and Roll High School sounds like a porno.
4662013	4665254	Solid Goomba says, Hamsters are proof God loves us.
4665774	4667055	Now, the website... I agree.
4667215	4677157	To be fair, the company, Data Design Interactive, to be fair, they did put out E-Rake Extreme Metal Racing, which apparently is a pretty cool game.
4677217	4683539	I mean, it mixes heavy metal with racing, so... These guys sound like modern-day geniuses.
4683599	4685580	They know the types of games people want.
4686020	4687680	Who doesn't want Ninja Bread Man?
4688401	4689541	It's just, I don't know...
4690595	4693376	Please explain to me how this could possibly be a bad thing.
4694596	4697316	They're in the UK, so, I mean... That's even better!
4698717	4700217	Now Jamie's gonna want him, too!
4701057	4704058	We can contact their project director.
4704078	4706078	The hamster thing just sounds dirty.
4707578	4708639	I want them on the show.
4709499	4710459	I'll do whatever it takes.
4711799	4712099	Anyhow.
4715820	4719481	I think this is interesting, and this is one group that will not be playing...
4723843	4735506	What's basically going on is that there's this Christian group, and they call themselves the Porn Talk, which is backed by basically a faith-based ministry.
4735666	4742567	They've started a website that basically has this huge banner on it, and it says, We have a porn problem.
4742968	4745888	Porn safety facts for Nintendo's Wii gaming console.
4745908	4748049	And if you want to visit the site, it's theporntalk.com.
4749039	4749800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4770402	4788733	I would like to also point out to the geniuses behind ThePornTalk.com that the computers you used to make ThePornTalk.com, that you're urging your kids to go check out to keep them away from porn, or, well, okay, I guess they're really not doing that, but you're urging parents to go check out to keep their kids away from porn, that device can also be used to access porn.
4789293	4792915	If your child has a cell phone, that can be used to access porn.
4793075	4793956	Here's something funny, too.
4794016	4799479	If they have a dollar, or what is it, $3.95, that can be used to access porn.
4799927	4803008	at your local... Is somebody fucking racing outside?
4803028	4804028	That's why I don't like having the window open.
4804048	4804968	In your apartment complex.
4805128	4806669	Anyways, I gotta add this real quick.
4806749	4807509	Yeah.
4808850	4812891	Now, imagine, if you will, they tell them, yeah, go to that porn talk site.
4812931	4816092	They'll teach you how to, you know, prevent, you know, seeing porn and stuff.
4816552	4816872	Okay.
4817092	4820253	They don't remember what the website name was, so they search for porn talk.
4820873	4821273	Boom!
4821333	4821773	Porn!
4821793	4822393	There you go!
4823214	4828295	They've been... They've been, um... The porn beat them to the website, so...
4829369	4829649	I don't know.
4830009	4835230	They're bragging on their site that Porn Talk won best in show at the Addy Awards and all this junk.
4835250	4836751	What the fuck's the Addy Awards?
4836771	4837071	I don't know.
4837091	4837751	Who cares?
4838491	4844473	It's the award show where we invited just us and we won because we're awesome.
4844573	4847273	We've been talking about the Wii and Wi-Fi devices on the Porn Talk blog.
4847293	4853495	We'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this issue and your suggestions on dealing with devices that come with internet capabilities.
4853936	4859519	They should be banning PCs next then and Macs and your cell phone.
4859639	4861260	Why don't you crawl into a cave?
4862341	4864723	I'm just looking at some interesting comments on the actual site itself.
4865003	4866864	I figure these comments are posted publicly.
4866904	4868705	There's no problem with me reading them on air, correct?
4869686	4870346	Ray said...
4871013	4875034	I'm all for talking to your kids about porn, but the porntalk.com goes a little overboard.
4875415	4878095	Using filtering software on your 17-year-old is a little outrageous.
4878516	4880536	He or she will be in college the next year.
4880836	4882237	Do you really want them so sheltered?
4882277	4883057	They'll go crazy.
4883377	4889699	Not to mention the chances are your 17-year-old will know a lot more about computers than you and will have no problem getting any content they want.
4890219	4894241	In related news, Ray is the OLR Not Listener of the Week.
4899042	4899883	Common sense, people.
4899943	4900503	Fucking use it.
4903480	4908423	And you know there are ways to block the internet for your children.
4908503	4909724	Yeah, don't download the thing.
4911785	4912306	There you go.
4913386	4915748	But of course that would involve the parents being involved.
4915888	4919970	So, yeah, that's not going to ever happen.
4920010	4920951	That's never going to work.
4920991	4921791	I mean, come on.
4922152	4924513	GS68 makes an excellent point in chat.
4924813	4928515	GS68 over at chat.orangelearnersradio.com says, Women have boobs.
4928976	4930356	Women are gateway to porn.
4931237	4931637	There you go.
4932038	4932798	It's all women's fault.
4933407	4934468	What do you think about that, DarkSakura?
4935308	4936389	Oh yes, boobs.
4936869	4938270	Oh, it's all of our fault.
4938750	4943913	And while they're at it, how about putting live birth on TV too?
4944193	4945874	Because that shows off the coochie.
4946914	4950776	Well, don't they already have to show the miracle of life as part of education in schools?
4951317	4952257	Not if you live in Alabama.
4952297	4954138	Well, that was a gateway to pornography.
4954479	4960722	The minute I saw a baby flying out of that woman's vagina, I knew I never ever wanted to touch one.
4964132	4965213	Health Ed made you gay.
4965233	4970836	Yeah, yeah, sex education made me gay, I think, I don't know.
4971456	4985184	Anyway, obviously stories about these crazy people who go OMG porn and have these hair trigger reactions and this kind of crap get us angry, and when we get angry it's time for our FUs of the week.
4997569	4998449	My F.U.
4998469	5003332	of the Week goes towards people who say, you're not so-and-so, so you don't know.
5004312	5007293	Like, you're not a parent, so you have no right to talk about children.
5008974	5010955	No, I'm intelligent.
5011515	5012235	I have a brain.
5012336	5013176	I'm observant.
5013896	5014997	I've had little brothers.
5016077	5023380	As a human being and as a woman who may one day give birth to children... Shiver.
5024621	5026742	Not you, just the baby flying out of your vagina.
5028619	5032342	I think that that completely discounts anything that you have to say.
5032682	5044111	When people start off with, you don't know because you are not, you know, that instantly removes all credibility from any argument that you might have by, because you're trying to immediately dismiss the other party.
5045131	5048394	That doesn't put you in a superior position, that puts you in a position of ignorance.
5048474	5049394	Fucking shut your mouth.
5050956	5051256	I'm done.
5052417	5052777	Loki!
5053878	5053978	Um...
5054830	5061655	I guess FUV or Apartment Complex for not actually having lines in the parking lot so everyone has to kind of guess to where the cars are supposed to be.
5062395	5063236	So that kind of sucks.
5063376	5073803	And have you noticed that none of these blogs that point out the porn on the PSP and porn on the Wii and stuff, nobody's talking about the PlayStation 3 at all.
5073823	5074784	No one owns a PlayStation 3.
5075925	5076565	Exactly.
5077426	5079547	So more porn for me, and in high definition.
5079747	5080568	So, hell yeah.
5080588	5080668	Yeah.
5083300	5088464	Rob D in chat says, I like how Sky makes it sound like vaginas are rocket launchers.
5089084	5090385	Well, in a way they kind of are.
5092507	5092907	Right, Jamie?
5094148	5094548	No.
5095309	5095569	All right.
5095889	5104095	Anyhow, my FU of the week goes to lack of sleep because I swear like every night this week I got maybe four hours of sleep at the most.
5104155	5105596	Of course, granted, that's my own downfall.
5105616	5106237	I know what you're thinking.
5106497	5107358	Go to bed early, Rob.
5107378	5107818	Well, you know.
5108632	5111493	There's such good TV on at 2 in the morning.
5111513	5112154	What can I say?
5112214	5113694	No, just, you know, for circumstances.
5113974	5117336	So I was just exhausted yesterday when Jamie and I were running around San Francisco yesterday.
5117356	5119117	I was so tired I thought I was going to pass out.
5119137	5121157	I slept for 11 hours last night.
5121678	5123058	But I feel pretty good today.
5123078	5124739	A bit groggy from oversleeping.
5125359	5126440	So FU to lack of sleep.
5128741	5129581	And that's it.
5130161	5131122	Rice Princess left.
5131482	5132202	LankyStyle left.
5132242	5133383	So we're the only ones in studio.
5133423	5136444	So back to the gaming news then since there's no more FUs of the week.
5137256	5138136	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5155697	5169765	took a survey of 1,000 drivers between the ages of 16 to 24 about video games, how it's affecting their driving habits, and the results stated 27% admitted to taking more risks on the road after playing a racing game.
5171426	5174267	And a quarter saying they pretend they're actually in a video game when they drive.
5176609	5181592	They're saying that that's an indisputable link between gaming and dangerous driving.
5184000	5202786	What they're not really paying attention to is that if they're interviewing people between the ages of 16 and 24, chances are that your audience is not going to be very fucking mature and not going to have the skill to know about, you know, how to drive properly.
5204487	5207288	It's... You're dying to say something over there, Loki.
5207868	5210909	What they fail to mention is all those people that said they drive recklessly, women.
5212461	5218449	Of course, then again, I mean, I can't imagine too many of them actually, 27%, yeah, that sounds about right.
5219090	5220352	I don't know.
5221920	5222380	It doesn't matter.
5222420	5225701	Anyways, even if they weren't playing video games, they'd still be crashing into this shit.
5225941	5229582	I swear to God, people talking on their cell phones, drifting in and out of lanes.
5230143	5232863	Oh, the funniest thing happened to me today.
5233404	5234404	I bought food.
5234944	5236164	Oh my God.
5236565	5241466	Meanwhile, people are dying and just like totally oblivious to the fucking world.
5241606	5243327	How did I end up in this river?
5244047	5246147	They totally jumped out in front of me.
5246348	5250449	It's like... I think anything that...
5252452	5256154	has an effect on your reaction.
5256174	5263999	Like, if you have a predisposition toward anger or nervousness, that's what's going to, I think, more affect how you drive.
5265320	5267321	Not so much the game.
5267381	5276566	I mean, that's just, that's really, I mean, even when I was a new driver, you know, playing hard driving didn't make me want to go out and do the loop on the road.
5277007	5279288	But then again, hard driving, you were driving super damn slow.
5279308	5281069	At least it felt slow in the game.
5281300	5284921	It's not playing a driving video game that makes you want to drive fast.
5284981	5289702	It's the fucking Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 2 soundtrack that makes you want to drive fast.
5291042	5294842	Fuck yeah.
5295583	5298023	Try and catch me now, fucking coppers.
5298863	5299283	Exactly.
5299403	5308785	And to be a little bit serious here, I would think if anything, playing video games would help you drive better because you're actually going to have a faster reaction time.
5309529	5314651	Um, you know, from games, they've actually helped you improve your reaction time a little bit, I would think.
5315351	5319293	So, whatever, it's a fucking survey.
5319873	5320653	Surveys suck.
5322094	5324094	Survey says you suck.
5325655	5333578	So, funny you should be playing, um, you know, that kind of music, but, um, Yuzo Kishiro is going to be DJing play, um,
5335561	5341723	Actually, the concert in June, he's going to be DJing, I believe it's the concert in Japan?
5341963	5343603	No, in Singapore.
5344064	5345624	I better start driving to Singapore.
5351446	5353546	Yes, Rob, drive to Singapore.
5354807	5356747	Through the ocean, that would be awesome.
5357447	5359448	I'll drive so fast I'll float on the water, come on.
5361002	5361582	Right.
5362243	5365385	Or maybe you'll just fart so hard you'll float over the water.
5366526	5376932	But I thought that was pretty cool, and he's done such music from Streets of Rage, Revenge of Shinobi, Actraiser, Castlevania Portrait of Ruin, lots of stuff.
5378513	5379774	Going to be spinning some tracks.
5380594	5383036	Too bad he's not coming over here, just in Singapore.
5383796	5385757	Ah, Bandit is my new best friend in chat.
5386358	5388539	If Sonic can do it, why can't Sky?
5389180	5389820	Thank you very much.
5390419	5392641	Sonic is a fictional blue hedgehog.
5393842	5395903	I don't think hedgehogs move that fast anyways.
5397605	5398385	You're just pokey.
5401268	5403069	I think it was irony or something.
5404330	5407613	And hamster heroes, is there a hamster that runs real fast?
5408093	5409954	I don't know, but there's one that looks like Batman.
5410495	5412116	Oh my god, this is the best game ever!
5414418	5415399	Fucking hamsters...
5416178	5418380	Have you ever had a hamster?
5418520	5420121	In grade school.
5420161	5423743	I just remember whenever you go in the classroom that has a hamster, it smells like poop.
5424044	5426605	And they poop out pellets, which I always thought was amusing.
5426625	5429047	Let me tell you a story about hamsters real quick.
5429107	5430428	Hamsters are retarded.
5430748	5435472	The reason you would own a hamster is to watch how retarded it is.
5435972	5436893	I had a hamster.
5436913	5440095	We named him Sam because it was squeaks and moves.
5440155	5441816	That's basically what it stood for.
5441876	5442877	That's so creative.
5444238	5445519	The hamster would spin...
5446303	5447443	Thank you for watching!
5475000	5477182	That's the Wii game I want.
5477202	5483306	They sit there, their feet fucking up in the air, pull the poop out of their ass, and they throw it.
5485688	5487289	It's the weirdest thing to see.
5487990	5490171	You guys don't understand why I'm laughing so hard.
5490632	5496696	Because, and thank God this isn't TV, but Loki actually put his feet up in the air.
5499313	5503154	and reached for it and did the motion like the hamster does.
5503654	5505574	Rob's all red in the face and adorable.
5507195	5509695	Oh my god, we need a TV show just for moments like that.
5509715	5510455	The hell we do.
5511855	5513296	We'd have a hamster on the TV show.
5513856	5514476	Put a cape on him.
5514876	5516936	Maybe that should be our new mascot as a hamster.
5516956	5519757	Eh, they only live about a year or two, so it's not worth it.
5519797	5523578	And every single one of them dies from cancer, so I'm not even worried.
5525078	5526018	Not even worth it.
5527076	5527376	HamsterDance
5548520	5576848	and let's see that's coming out for $30 and that by the way originally showed up in Japan in September of 2005 so it's like one of those hey it's about freaking time we got that over here it was supposed to come out last year around August as well but then company it switched company XS Game dropped it so yeah whatever anyhow it should be noted though that Raiden 4 is coming out on Xbox 360 for those of you unfamiliar with the franchise it's just one of those shooter games that you know a lot of people love so there you go
5577899	5579400	Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence Online Servers
5607644	5608945	is going bye-bye.
5609465	5612347	As of April 2nd, it will be gone.
5614108	5615909	The community is not big enough.
5618051	5627857	Now, the user community for the game, those who are loyal to it, are putting up internet petitions to try to keep it up, but it's in the category of not fucking lightly.
5629158	5629358	Sorry.
5629558	5629758	Sorry.
5630680	5631600	We'd like if it works.
5631861	5635943	Petitions don't usually magically fix everything, but I know that's got to suck to get the plug pulled.
5636203	5638704	Music game fans got Amplitude's plug pulled on them.
5639024	5642026	But again, Amplitude came out like five years ago.
5642386	5645988	Metal Gear Substance 3, Substance, I can never remember.
5646008	5646408	About a year ago.
5646948	5647949	Yeah, it's not that old.
5648069	5648629	It was in March.
5648689	5649249	Substance.
5649530	5650570	I got it, Substance.
5651210	5655092	Yeah, and to be honest, it just didn't sell that well and not many people used it online.
5655152	5659094	And this is what you get when you have, you know, fucking networks that are run by each individual company.
5659134	5660355	So one centralized network,
5661024	5662185	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5687984	5689204	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5712210	5723338	including some photon whips and slicers, new stages, even a casino and apparently the casino is run by penguin-esque Rappies.
5723538	5724839	Maybe I should go back to PSU.
5726941	5727621	That sounds neat.
5728282	5728902	I like penguins.
5728942	5731844	I like Rappies.
5732125	5737909	Rappies, no, if you've done the Rappie holiday quest, you will never like Rappies again.
5738601	5743803	Which I believe is still going in the Fantasy Star Online, or the old PSO.
5744143	5750125	I believe the Christmas Quest is still going on the Xbox One, as it has been for the past, not 360, but the regular Xbox.
5750265	5753066	It was going on Blue Burst for like six months.
5753086	5753786	Yeah, seriously.
5754367	5755067	Oh, jeez.
5755387	5755987	That's awesome.
5756327	5758328	They're all, oh crap, we still have that game.
5759048	5759368	Hmm.
5760069	5763610	And for anyone who'd like to know, I quit PSU last week.
5764990	5766231	Congratulations.
5766491	5766951	Yeah, congratulations.
5767655	5772957	That goes to show just what my opinion of PSU is.
5773057	5778918	I've been playing World of Warcraft and I'm trying to get Jamie to join our little guild we've got going on Ravencrest.
5779838	5780699	I think I talked her into it.
5780759	5783379	How about when I have time and when someone gets me Burning Crusade?
5784920	5786580	Alright, how about we take a break?
5786640	5787681	I like breaks.
5788161	5796083	A break, and when we come back we'll have more of Orange Lounge Radio, more hilarious things coming out of Loki's mouth and other orifices probably.
5797142	5800523	in the next part, Part B. Because we have a lot of 360 news we haven't gotten to yet.
5800804	5808806	So we'll see you back in a little bit for Orange Lounge Radio Part B. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
5809266	5813588	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
