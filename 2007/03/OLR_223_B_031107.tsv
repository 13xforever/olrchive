20928	22068	Orange Lounge Radio
46147	47948	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
72389	77631	And how Sony's winning a lot of people back over thanks to their announcements about home Well, what about Nintendo?
78151	97517	Well, Nintendo basically made only two unveilings in their conference at GDC And that was a new Mario Galaxy trailer and the fact that it would be out this year And a type of, I don't know what you'd want to call it, Mii Idol or something like that Basically a, do you like this Mii, it's like a Mii popularity channel
98017	99659	has been announced for the Nintendo Wii.
100139	108665	Not a lot of announcements outside of that, but then again, a lot of people are saying, ah, Nintendo, you guys suck, Sony made all these announcements, and Nintendo, you didn't do crap.
108685	111407	Well, keep in mind, folks, it was Game Developers Conference.
111707	112928	What did Miyamoto talk about?
113209	121455	He talked about the waifu meter, he talked about how Mario 128 kind of evolved into the game Pikmin, he talked about game development types of things.
121935	124437	On that end, Nintendo really didn't disappoint, I don't think.
125181	131324	But, you know, if you were there looking for the E3 Bangin' Fireworks press conference, I guess you were going to be a little disappointed.
131704	136086	But, of course, we remember that story last week that said, hey, Nintendo's got some stock things going on.
136306	139708	They're not going to be able to make any big announcements at GDC, whether they want to or not.
140148	141149	So, there you have it.
141729	145011	So, unfortunately, the only little trinkets you got there from Nintendo were those two things.
145371	147292	But, curious, what do you guys think about that?
147332	149453	Did either of you guys watch the new Galaxy trailer?
149473	150073	What did you think of it?
150390	150950	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
166747	195016	Mario Galaxy because it looks like you can flip 2D to 3D at a touch of a button like if you're playing the 2D thing and like you see a wheel thing like there was one video I saw like a wheel spiked wheel was coming at you you hit a button to go to 3D and then you can run around the wheel and then you go back to the 2D mode it's so crazy I liked it it was very cool so that was something I'm looking forward to way more than any of the other stuff that was talked about unfortunately I don't know Smash Brothers I'll give Mario Galaxy a try of course I want my Smash Brothers we'll see
195539	199500	Again, if you want to give your comments in chat, it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
199520	200460	That's the second time I've done this show.
200721	202281	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
202401	204982	I'm out of it tonight.
205022	205562	Something's wrong.
206262	207823	There's something in the water I'm drinking tonight.
207883	210503	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
212124	214385	Actdeft says, Super Paper Mario for the win.
215065	218626	Blackwolf was at Game Developers Conference and played Super Paper Mario.
218646	220406	He says, Super Paper Mario equals fun.
220786	222147	The A button goes to 3D.
223587	252232	Joshi says Super Paper Mario is when I get a Wii so it looks like a lot of folks are very excited SSJ100Matt says yay more channels but how about Galaxy, Smash, and Metroid there's your comments from chat anyways this week we saw some pretty good stuff coming to the virtual console including Super Ghouls and Ghosts and that was of course very fucking hard as usual and of course Sword of Vermillion um
253050	255832	and Elevator Action for the, well, that was on the NES.
256973	260235	And this week, though, what are we going to be getting?
261135	265498	Well, from what I've been hearing, I think Sonic Spinball was among those.
265518	270681	I know it was on the Japan launch there, at least what they're getting this week.
271422	276205	And if I remember correctly, they also were getting Excitebike and Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
276986	278887	I think that was on the website, yeah.
278908	279668	So maybe that is on its way.
306522	308843	I think they saw Spinball there too, if I remember correctly.
308983	309343	Interesting.
309763	310283	I can't remember.
311263	316144	But, you know, you're going to expect about three games tomorrow or Monday.
316444	319305	Anything on Virtual Console that you were dying for still not out?
319385	321526	I mean, I got Kid Icarus, so I kind of got my wish.
321626	322486	I have R-Type.
323226	325407	Yeah, I know, but anything not out that you still want?
325447	332548	I mean, obviously Guardian Legend, but realistically something from either Nintendo itself or one of their very close third-party developers.
332568	333108	Snow Brothers.
333408	334029	Snow Brothers.
334529	335409	That's an interesting choice.
336018	337099	I remember that game, actually.
338460	342923	I would like to see, and I know Jamie hates this one, but I really like Strider on the NES.
343884	345485	I didn't say I hated it.
345525	348687	It was actually, the game was based off of the Strider manga.
349207	349608	Oh, okay.
349728	352730	I thought you told me once you hated it because the arcade one is so much better.
353410	355412	I didn't say I hate it, just the arcade one is so much better.
355452	358974	Wouldn't it be neat, though, one week to get Strider on NES and Strider on Genesis?
359495	360475	That would be kind of cool, wouldn't it?
360495	360896	Yeah.
361256	361416	Yeah.
362388	363988	Mega Man would be my other wish.
364008	365649	Yeah, they need some Mega Man games on there.
365669	366509	It would be pretty cool.
367809	369870	Actually, Capcom just needs some more stuff on there.
370690	371990	I would think it would be pretty cool.
372730	374211	I was a fan of this game, at least.
374491	375131	Uniracers?
376151	376511	I don't know.
376711	378312	No one really played that game for Nintendo.
378612	379932	I'm looking at chat room here.
380352	381912	Of course, you bring up Virtual Console.
381932	383173	Everyone makes their list of demands.
383473	385033	James Patrick says Secret of Mana.
385447	386808	Secret of Mana, and Evermore.
387408	389028	Mori says Earthbound, please.
389669	390829	Ryoma says Ice Climbers.
391029	392150	Actually, Ice Climbers is already up.
392190	392650	Go check it out.
393310	396411	Unless he was referring to something else, but I think that's what it was.
396451	396911	Salamander.
396971	399112	Life Force in this country, but yeah, that would be cool.
399612	401133	Actdeft says Kirby Superstar.
401693	402113	There you go.
402473	406375	Mel B on our staff says Tecmo Bowl, but will it be licensed?
406435	406995	Not likely.
407355	411677	I think they should just leave it in there with the old, like, 88 lineup or whatever that game had in it.
411697	412277	That would be funny.
413157	413478	Wouldn't it?
414178	414378	Mm-hmm.
414478	414638	Mm-hmm.
415267	419688	Then you could still play us the 49ers and actually be good because it's 1988.
419908	423169	That was a sports joke.
423209	424269	I don't make those very often.
424289	427030	It was a sports joke for you guys out there.
428990	436172	Well, for those who are disgusted with Rob's sports jokes, no, not really.
436532	438592	This has absolutely nothing to do with sports.
438872	440913	We have Chocobo Tales coming out in...
441798	457610	May in the UK, that is, it's coming out April 3rd here in the US, but you play as a chocobo, and you have to, you know, stop the bad guy from, you know, I guess being all evil, even though he's all evil.
458671	469559	So you go around and you do minigames, and you build up a deck in card battles and save the universe on your DS through the Wi-Fi.
470200	471401	So, um,
472509	474270	Final Fantasy 2 U.S.
474310	475311	Forge of Japan
500456	503819	You would have to use the big carrot when it came up on the screen and said, Smells like Chocobo.
504259	506661	And you kind of always wondered, what the hell does a Chocobo smell like?
506721	508882	Does it smell like farts or roses or what?
509203	509943	Smells like chicken shit.
510604	511604	Kentucky Fried Chicken?
512005	512225	What?
512905	514647	No, it's Kentucky Faraga Chocobo.
514827	515147	Sorry.
516465	517525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
541784	546766	No price announced here yet, but I guess based off those prices, you could speculate $34, $39.99, right?
546826	549328	That would be a fair statement.
550408	555390	I guess something to compete with the PSP a little bit, although this is not included with the DS.
555490	556471	It's kind of something extra.
557231	561693	But if you've ever wanted to surf the Internet while on the go on your DS, there you have it.
563454	564895	I would not buy that.
565975	566876	I'm not feeling this.
567056	567736	I'm really not.
568216	569237	You know what would have been cool?
570129	574292	If I had the internet channel on my Wii, then I could beam it over to my DS.
574612	576834	Whatever happened to that functionality?
576874	579036	Wasn't that something they said you could do at one point?
579316	581057	Is that the DS would interface with the Wii?
581477	585520	Well, they're going to have that with some future games, but they may add that later.
585900	588362	I have a feeling that's something up their sleeve.
588502	590864	DS demos on your Wii a little later on.
591064	591484	Why not?
592405	592765	I don't know.
593226	597629	But one thing I was going to say is I think that they've done this probably better at homebrew.
597649	597869	I mean...
599401	608344	Really, the only problem and the reason why they don't have a lot of the Flash support and stuff is because there's not enough RAM in the system and there's no storage.
608544	612405	It's just pretty much the cart itself, which doesn't hold that much.
612946	619448	And you would probably need to have some sort of Game Boy Advance thing plugged in the bottom.
619488	621128	In fact, I think that's what they did in Japan.
621828	623369	A couple different versions of that, so...
624305	627147	Joshi16 wants to know, is there going to be an OLR DS page?
627327	629789	Since we have the PSP page and a Wii one in the works.
630069	630609	Probably not.
631329	633491	I don't think that many people are going to be using that.
633511	636513	Maybe like five people would use it, if even that.
637073	638834	Do we even have five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?
638874	642956	I don't think we do, actually, so I don't think there'd be a lot of point to do that.
644157	645798	Five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?
645978	646098	Yeah.
646118	649260	I think we have more than that.
649300	650321	Maybe a handful, I don't know.
651865	655387	The first episode we only had five listeners, but my how we've grown since then.
656087	658249	Thank you guys so much for supporting us over the years.
658269	660751	You know our fifth anniversary is coming up in just two months.
661171	666274	Two months is the station, but I think we're actually going to celebrate it with the first live show, which was June 23rd, 2002.
667175	668316	Wow.
669737	674820	So last week we talked about how the Wii didn't have me support for third parties.
675655	682196	And now this week, SNK's president says that they're not letting third parties have online capabilities either.
684357	691158	Which is funny, because Sega's got a Pachinko game coming out that does have online and does have Mii support.
691238	697299	So I basically ask, are they just not letting SNK have online support or Mii support?
697319	701080	Because to be honest, I mean, and I'm sure everyone can agree with me,
701559	702500	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
731809	737451	Alright, well, let's go on to another topic, shall we?
738932	746174	Well, this is something that we've been, of course, talking about since the announcement of having our E3 taken from us.
747575	753637	But there is going to be E3 this year, if you were invited, it's July 11th through 13th.
755402	766753	To quote the invite, it says, The opportunity to engage in one-on-one meetings with leading game company executives in an intimate setting as well as network, socialize, and test pilot major company offerings.
768494	769956	Well, I got invited.
770937	771958	Congratulations.
772638	776142	So, if it works out for me, I'm going to go.
776242	777223	But I'm actually...
778274	783578	I sort of do see more now of the logic and them changing it to more of a meeting base.
783598	785959	I think we're still going to have the demos and such.
785979	790122	It's just not going to be the big over-the-top production that E3 was in the past.
790462	794084	And not really many people have figured out why people are getting invited.
794244	795805	I was actually looking just earlier today.
795845	798027	Joystick ran an interesting story on the whole thing.
798067	804731	And apparently they're saying, they said here in the story, this week that some journalists received their invites, but many did not.
804871	805952	And interesting enough,
806640	810904	Jamie did get an invite, and so did someone else on our staff who works behind the scenes.
811845	812846	But Loki and I have not.
813747	816189	So where's the love, you guys?
816490	818612	I know there's some developers out there that listen to us.
818872	820253	Sniff, sniff, cry, cry.
820293	820974	Send us an email.
821014	821554	We want to go.
821595	823016	We'll interview you, have you on the show.
823717	825038	We'll play Beat the Host with you.
825458	826279	We'll bring our rig.
827780	828741	No, but I do hope...
829892	831513	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
853266	853646	I don't know.
853706	866232	It's just like a lot of times we didn't go to... I mean, we went to meetings for some things, but I got a lot of accomplishments with booth tours and stuff like that and actually meeting people face-to-face instead of just actually having meetings and stuff.
866512	867613	Rob went to meetings with me.
868233	870414	At this point, it's really all speculation.
870454	871735	We just don't know how they're picking it.
872515	873936	It might also have to do with how you registered.
874887	876549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
896252	900276	Shifting gears completely here, going from E3 to talk about politics a little bit.
900836	906421	Game Politics ran a story earlier this week about the video games made me do it defense.
907622	920153	Well, apparently what happened is that this 19-year-old Patrick Morris actually shot his 15-year-old boy with a shotgun and used the good old excuse, the video games made me do it.
921073	926276	and his mom even tried to go in there and say, he would just go into his room and play those video games.
926857	933381	Well, the prosecution brought out Dr. Michael Knapp from Ashland, Oregon, and he said it was ridiculous to blame video games.
934001	942786	Moreover, he said while you usually can't predict violent behavior, other risk factors in Morris' life, such as his drug use and emotional disorders, were much stronger factors.
943627	948029	So after 30 minutes of deliberations, the judge sentenced Morris to life imprisonment
949412	949992	in prison.
950053	951233	The video games made me do it.
951253	952814	Defense carried no weight.
953235	953675	Ha!
954155	957858	As well, it should have not had any weight because that's a stupid defense.
958118	959779	Because it was the hip-hop music that did it.
960060	962601	No one made you press the power button, asshole.
962721	964763	It was the hip-hop music game that made me do it.
964783	966664	It's all Def Jam Icon's fault.
966684	968405	It was Def Jam Icon, absolutely.
970367	971247	Um, but anyway.
971348	977772	Actually, if anything makes me want to go out and get a shotgun and shoot people, it would probably be Sonic on the PlayStation 3.
978132	978913	I don't know about you.
980100	981341	Please don't take me literally.
981601	982802	I hope you guys know I'm joking.
984223	994412	Well, sometimes we talk about harming the certain beta testers of online functions in, say, portable Grand Theft Auto games.
995232	997234	Because you fucking sucked at it.
997434	1008783	But anyways, one thing, though, that's going to make people, especially Sega, make some more games is this online poll that they have where they're trying to figure out the interests of...
1010236	1011076	Night would be awesome
1038615	1043919	And, you know, I think it would be really good, though, to move on to something else that doesn't have to do with video game news.
1044740	1045020	Really?
1045080	1045500	Right, Rob?
1045761	1046381	What would that be?
1046561	1047442	That would be the mailbag.
1047862	1051225	Ah, but don't our emailers sometimes email us with video game-related things?
1051285	1051605	I would hope so.
1051625	1052646	Sometimes, but I ignore it.
1052946	1053207	All right.
1053767	1056349	All right, well, let's open up the old mailbag and see what's in store.
1056689	1059371	If you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1059672	1060793	All right.
1066492	1069274	Today's first email actually comes from GrinWithoutACat.
1069694	1070035	Hi.
1083104	1084606	and 45 million sold in Europe.
1084867	1090835	The slimline model is actually sold better in Europe than anywhere else, with 18 million against North America's 16 million and Japan's 6 million.
1091415	1098906	Europe also seems to be the one who takes a mis-interest in their casual and innovative games such as iToy, SingStar, and Buzz, a quiz game with buzzer peripherals.
1099346	1099946	Thanks for watching!
1120109	1121430	Thank you for watching.
1121450	1122030	See you next time.
1141163	1141564	I don't know.
1141584	1148548	It seems like every week we're getting some type of email from a European listener, and understandably so, don't get me wrong.
1148849	1153792	But a European listener who's a little bit upset because they're constantly getting screwed by the game companies.
1154292	1156674	So unfortunately I don't have an easy answer for you on that one.
1157254	1158115	But thank you for the insight.
1158315	1159036	We do appreciate that.
1160316	1162318	I thought that was actually a very well thought out email.
1162598	1163919	So thank you for sending it.
1165241	1167363	Next one comes up is from BearWhoDriveCar.
1167743	1170325	Please make Sky stop attempting accents, especially British.
1170366	1170766	That is all.
1172607	1174409	Well, I don't know what you're talking about.
1174689	1176050	Rob, your accent really is awful.
1176070	1176630	Carry on.
1177051	1178292	Would you like to go out and have some tea?
1178772	1179533	It's really awful.
1180293	1182655	BearWhoDriveCar, would you like to go out and have some tea?
1182695	1183516	A spot of tea?
1184797	1186378	Or are you going to continue to be a tit?
1188000	1190181	Next up comes from Cy.
1190201	1191522	This is DearOLR.
1191582	1192263	Hi, Grin.
1192737	1200804	Anyhow, on my World of Warcraft server, there's a guild called LessQQMorePewPew.
1201284	1202145	Just thought it was funny.
1202545	1203045	Love the show.
1203065	1203706	You guys rock.
1203726	1204246	Stuff like that.
1205367	1207549	The OLR guild is on Ravencrest, by the way.
1207569	1210151	If you want more information, go to the forums.
1210411	1213254	Although that is a great name for a guild, LessQQMorePewPew.
1213554	1214915	I should look that up on the armory.
1217977	1218698	So how about this?
1219879	1220980	This one comes from Ali.
1221980	1225603	So I thought I would voice a few opinions on your cynicism toward the PS3.
1225923	1229966	My brother had the opportunity to play a PS3 a couple of days ago, and he told me it was really a lot of fun.
1230346	1232948	I believe he played Resistance, Fall of Man, and Gran Turismo HD.
1233409	1235550	Now granted, my brother is a pretty hardcore gamer.
1235590	1239673	He pulled strings to get himself an Xbox 360 at launch, got a PS2 at launch, etc.
1240133	1242375	Now I thought I would remind you of the PS2 launch.
1242455	1247559	Everyone told us we were crazy for spending that much on a game system, and the Dreamcast was so much better.
1248473	1253075	I also remember reading that the emotion engine was nigh impossible to program for.
1253175	1256097	However, once time passed, the PS2 gained traction price-wise.
1256497	1262460	The price stayed even as Flint inflation went on, and people cracked how to get the most out of their EE.
1263141	1264381	Now, look at the PS3.
1264421	1270084	Everyone says the 360 is 100 times better, that the cell is near impossible to program for, and that it was too expensive.
1270164	1271585	I think that will happen in a year or two.
1271605	1273546	The PS2 will see a revival and will take the market.
1274164	1280446	Other than that, I literally got my 360 a half hour ago, and I got Crackdown, Call of Duty 3, Gears of War, Saints Row, and Test Drive Unlimited.
1280746	1284067	The reason I'm telling you this is that I want some music games.
1284527	1289649	I heard that DDR for 360 wasn't too good, and as far as I can tell, Guitar Hero 2 is not on Xbox 360.
1290269	1293731	Will Guitar Hero come out for the Xbox 360, and is DDR any good on 360?
1293791	1295211	Yeah, it is coming out on 360.
1295451	1298172	I believe April is the big month for Guitar Hero 2.
1298212	1298932	I like this.
1299132	1300713	Insert usual love the show drivel here.
1301819	1302080	Thank you.
1302661	1308972	Boom Boom Rocket, I don't know much about, but people that have gotten their hands on it say if you like music games, you're going to like yourself some Boom Boom Rocket.
1309495	1309975	There's that.
1310035	1312837	I don't know when that'll be out, though, knowing the release schedule.
1312857	1313617	It could be summer.
1313637	1314798	It could be the end of the year.
1315638	1318760	DDR on the 360 is actually, it's not that bad.
1319180	1321081	It's just components of it are bad.
1321601	1325923	But the game itself, the main core element of the game, I mean, what's DDR?
1325984	1326964	It's songs and steps.
1327284	1329125	The songs are great, and the steps are great.
1329525	1330466	So that's it.
1330806	1331546	It's a fine game.
1331586	1336629	It's just all the other stuff around it, like quest mode, sucks, and some of the other stuff is not so hot.
1336909	1338470	But the game itself is fine.
1339611	1341392	It depends how much do you love DDR.
1341452	1343133	I mean, are you willing to spend 80 bucks on it?
1343273	1344054	That's the question.
1344434	1347356	But it's some good songs, and they'll keep you in shape and all that good stuff.
1348917	1355322	And our last email of the day is from AZHP.
1356663	1359725	Hey guys, just had a comment, possibly a very long comment.
1360625	1361826	Did I miss some?
1361946	1365449	Sorry, LankyStyle was here and leaving, and I was trying to kiss him on his bald head.
1365809	1365989	Okay.
1367408	1380672	On the email you guys got last week on the topic of piracy affecting game development, first of all, I'd like to say that the fact that Nintendo puts out arguably higher quality games than Sony and Microsoft is that they simply care more about the fun factor in the games than any other developer out there.
1381453	1392236	Shigeru Miyamoto said in his GDC keynote that if at any point during the development he feels they have lost sight of the fact that this game is supposed to make people happy, he scraps it and redoes it from the ground up.
1392376	1393037	That's devotion.
1393997	1394397	Secondly,
1394929	1397271	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1414545	1419447	This is purely marketing and financial-based decision and is probably not affected at all by the piracy issue.
1419828	1421869	Nintendo is not like other companies in this regard.
1422289	1429192	They spend as much time as they want or need pushing back release dates if necessary to ensure the highest quality games, not the highest quantity.
1430193	1432914	Lastly, Nintendo's consoles are not much harder to pirate.
1433937	1437640	are not any harder to pirate games on than the PS2 or Xbox.
1437980	1446607	I have a mod ship in my GameCube and I burn my original discs to many DVD-Rs so that I don't have to lug around giant DVD cases that GameCube games come in as I travel a lot.
1447088	1451411	There are also mods that allow you to use full-size DVDs for your games.
1452012	1456896	So the argument that Nintendo games are harder to pirate as a reason that Nintendo is succeeding is not valid.
1457492	1457792	A-freaking-men.
1483909	1488692	I would agree that piracy is something really that not the masses really gets in on.
1489112	1495076	I mean, very few people would know how to put DDR fifth mix on a PSP, Loki.
1495849	1498272	or would know how to do some of that stuff.
1498592	1501614	They would know how to pirate or mod a GameCube and all that stuff.
1501635	1502876	It's not an easy thing to do.
1503316	1504917	Your average person is not going to be able to do it.
1505338	1512724	I kind of think about when piracy got really busted and got out of control and I think about Napster and when did Napster really cross the line?
1513185	1519931	When like every media outlet started reporting on it and then every college kid in the nation was using Napster to download music off each other.
1520311	1524812	and to some extent, yeah, the piracy still goes on today, but it's not as easy as it used to be, right?
1524852	1530353	Like, remember it used to be like you just download Napster, type in Metallica and bam, you get like any song you wanted, right?
1530633	1539356	Yeah, now you have to download LimeWire and type in Metallica and then you can... And hopefully you connect to the server and you have to configure, and the thing isn't as user-friendly and you have to configure all that stuff.
1540296	1541676	It's not as easy as it was.
1541696	1545897	It's all about BitTorrent and use groups or Usenet.
1546177	1549638	I'm not saying just because it's not easy makes it right, but I'm just, you know, that
1550066	1558848	That is true that, you know, you're probably never going to eliminate piracy completely, but you can make it difficult enough where that most people aren't going to figure out how to do it or care.
1559308	1559548	Right?
1560669	1560909	Yeah.
1562069	1563329	Loki, you're just an exception.
1563349	1564350	You're a special child.
1564430	1564790	Face it.
1565610	1566730	Let's give him some donuts.
1567030	1567991	All right.
1568391	1569191	Is that it for the mailbag?
1570031	1570911	That would be it.
1570931	1571992	Einhander is awesome.
1572212	1573092	Send more email.
1573672	1574712	Mailbag at Orange Lodge.
1574732	1576233	You have Einhander on your PSP?
1576573	1576793	Yeah.
1576953	1577673	God damn you.
1578601	1585244	Mailbag, OrangeLaunchRadio.com Well, this is something else we can get mad about because we didn't have this.
1585905	1589427	This is kind of old news because it's ending like now.
1589947	1594910	But Australia actually had a free Xbox Live Gold service all weekend long.
1595510	1598391	That ran this weekend, March 9th through March 11th.
1599632	1603754	So if you're an Xbox Live Silver subscriber in Australia, you got three days worth of gold.
1604475	1605295	So pretty cool there.
1606042	1608143	Discovery Channel gave the Gears of War maps.
1608163	1609284	It wasn't Discovery Channel.
1609324	1609964	It was somebody else.
1609984	1610244	I don't know.
1631102	1634364	I think it was some type of network or TV show or something.
1634384	1635904	I'm sure somebody in chat room remembers.
1636545	1636945	Who knows?
1638545	1639106	I'm trying to see.
1639406	1639786	Maybe not.
1641567	1642287	History Channel?
1642327	1644648	Dark Knight says it was the History... No, I don't think it was the History Channel.
1647029	1647309	Was it?
1647329	1648030	I don't know.
1648890	1649210	Alrighty.
1649770	1655533	Anyways, so people love free Xbox Live Gold Weekends.
1655673	1657614	People don't like Bullet Witch.
1658634	1659615	And Bullet Witch...
1660521	1662502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1680347	1692829	No lock-on, cheap deaths, horrendous voice acting, cumbersome systems for casting spells, which I might agree that is pretty bad, camera angle too low to the ground, and invisible and visible barriers all over the place.
1694009	1695910	I don't know, it just sounds to me... It's a giant brain.
1696150	1697170	It's sloppy stuff.
1697670	1705571	Well, a giant brain's kind of cool, you know, because that's just an enemy that you fight, and the fact that it's a giant brain makes it easier to hit with their crappy targeting system.
1706112	1707392	So, I don't know.
1708112	1708612	It's okay.
1708632	1708712	Okay.
1709071	1714774	I think it was one of those games, though, that probably shouldn't have been brought over here for, you know, the full price.
1714875	1720658	Maybe, well, it was $49.99, so maybe $39.99 would have been a better price.
1721318	1723640	Maybe, like, they have to pay us to play it.
1724620	1726301	Yeah, maybe free would have been a better price.
1727722	1728062	Maybe.
1728683	1731925	Hey, at least it wasn't as bad as Bomberman Act Zero.
1732405	1733185	That is one thing.
1733205	1735847	Oh, great, they could put that on the sticker, a little sticker, so, you know,
1736409	1739951	Loki from Horizons Radio says, hey, it wasn't as bad as Bomberman Act Zero.
1741111	1745954	Well, I have something that should make everybody happy in regards to Xbox Live.
1746634	1752217	We have the classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game going to Xbox Live.
1753037	1763382	And it's going to be actually out, I believe the date was March 21st, which is right before the movie comes out on March 23rd, guys.
1763682	1764983	Isn't that speculation still?
1765003	1765243	Because...
1765669	1766590	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1795540	1802886	Oh, also, you can still play it alone, and it's like co-op if you want it, I guess.
1803226	1803966	But it's still Turtles.
1804427	1805367	Dibs on Leonardo.
1806368	1807429	Dibs on Donatello for me.
1809210	1809590	All right.
1810371	1817276	Well, you know, I want to address this real quick before we get into our next segment, but I noticed this coming up quite a bit in our chat.
1817316	1819297	I've seen this like twice now tonight, and it's coming up again.
1819827	1823588	and the person who's posting it has an OL Army recruit number in front of him, so I can't credit it.
1823908	1830569	But somebody is spreading around this story about Mushroom Kingdom Hearts coming to the Nintendo Wii.
1831409	1832449	It's got to be fake, right?
1832469	1833970	It's an April Fool's joke.
1834230	1835070	That's what it is.
1835210	1838151	Every year they do an April Fool's joke and it's April Fool's joke.
1838171	1839191	God, I hate April Fool's Day.
1839611	1840031	Oh, I see.
1840071	1844772	So the upcoming April issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly and they always do some stupid-ass April Fool's thing.
1845252	1845972	All right, I get it.
1846661	1848201	It's gotta be a joke, come on.
1848381	1848902	It's a joke.
1848962	1849502	It is a joke.
1849522	1851082	They even pointed it out that it's a joke.
1851402	1852062	Yeah, alright.
1853723	1857744	It's a nice idea, but I don't... I would like a new Mario RPG.
1858324	1858504	Yeah.
1860004	1862105	But it's never... It's a great idea.
1862145	1865946	I think that's why it makes a pretty decent joke, but no, sorry guys, it's not a reality.
1866526	1866746	Yeah.
1868006	1875608	Alright, well, since Jamie brought up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles being confirmed for Xbox Live Arcade and all, we thought we'd take this opportunity...
1876395	1876636	LISTLESS
1893328	1909577	And it's been brought to my attention by a long-time listener and staff of the show, Dark Datsuya, that we may have actually done this topic once before, but we've deemed since it's been at least a year since we've done this topic, and so much has changed, and we have a lot of new listeners since the last time, we're going to go ahead and do a list list for this topic tonight.
1909897	1919162	And the list list would be, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was one of the most sought-after games for the Xbox Live marketplace, right?
1919182	1919222	So...
1921337	1925238	What arcade game now do people want to see on Xbox Live Arcade?
1925298	1928499	Now that Ninja Turtles has made its way over, what game should be next?
1929720	1931060	So this is the way Listless works.
1931700	1935781	Each of the three hosts and our special guest who's joining us for this segment, Miklatov.
1935881	1938362	Can we give Miklatov a mic so we can say hello to him?
1939863	1941443	No, good job dropping the mic.
1941723	1942123	Hello.
1942443	1942984	Hi, Miklatov.
1943004	1943344	How are you?
1943564	1943884	I'm good.
1944104	1944324	All right.
1944744	1946665	Miklatov's going to help us build a list.
1946965	1950446	So each of us are going to give our top three so we get a list of 12 games.
1951576	1957237	And then we're each going to go around and knock one thing off the list, leaving a list of eight games.
1957717	1969540	After that, the chat room will vote on their favorites, and we will get the definitive top one, two, and three list of the arcade games you would like to see ported over to Xbox Live Arcade.
1969900	1970961	So, let's start it off.
1971261	1972241	Who wants to start off tonight?
1973234	1973634	I shall.
1973835	1975076	Alright, ladies first.
1975376	1980481	What would be your pick for the game you would most like to see on Xbox Live Marketplace?
1980581	1981421	Arcade games, folks.
1981441	1982322	Number three, right?
1982402	1982903	Number three.
1983303	1983643	R-Type.
1984644	1985245	R-Type!
1985345	1986146	The arcade R-Type.
1986606	1987727	Why arcade R-Type?
1987747	1988868	Because it's fucking R-Type!
1991671	1993873	Alright, Loki, what would be your number three pick?
1995334	1997616	The arcade version of Bionic Commando.
1999403	2000564	Wow, that's kind of obscure.
2000624	2004269	How is the arcade version of Bionic Commando different from the NES, for those who don't know?
2004349	2005330	Hopefully not by much.
2006231	2006671	I don't know.
2006711	2007432	Better graphics.
2008894	2015742	I can just tell you, like, I haven't played Bionic Commando in the arcade, but I can tell you that, like, Rygar in the arcade and on the NES were completely frickin' different.
2016603	2018045	Alright, Mikotaba, why don't you go next?
2018065	2019166	Your number three pick.
2020009	2023672	I would say the X-Men game.
2024132	2025573	The big screen one.
2025693	2026413	The six person?
2026433	2027614	Yeah, that was a good game.
2027714	2030156	We talked about that last week here on the show, the X-Men game.
2030196	2031357	That's a very good choice.
2031637	2032337	Alright, X-Men.
2032718	2036420	My number three pick would be Quiz and Dragons.
2037020	2039882	So I can take on Bobby Blackwolf through Xbox Live.
2039982	2046287	Quiz and Dragons was this game and it had like, I think they used pretty much the same engine that Magic Sword and all those other games used.
2046307	2046947	What's Magic Sword?
2047247	2048168	God, okay, um
2048740	2050781	DarkSakura Planet Harrier Space Harrier
2077719	2079220	Which was a really freaking awesome game.
2079461	2081422	And I've played Planet Harrier in the arcade.
2081482	2082944	It's really, really fun.
2083744	2086087	And I think that it deserves some sort of home release.
2086707	2088629	Alright.
2088709	2089189	What next?
2089309	2093133	Loki, what would be your number two pick?
2093393	2103342	My number two pick would be... You know, actually, I would like to see... I see the image of the game.
2106001	2109623	I'm just going to have to go with, you know, the Beyonce Metal Slug, actually.
2110323	2112884	Because, why the hell not?
2113044	2115625	I mean, they're going to put Metal Slug in everything.
2115645	2117466	I'd rather have some achievements for it.
2118826	2119587	Alright, Metal Slug.
2119667	2123488	I can't believe you of all people just said that you need more Metal Slug.
2123528	2124829	You obviously are drawing a blank.
2125789	2129051	Alright, Miklatov, you're number two.
2130712	2131652	Turtles in Time.
2132093	2133914	because it's the superior one.
2134014	2135374	Turtles in Time, the sequel.
2135455	2135815	All right.
2135935	2136435	Sounds fair.
2136455	2138356	I love Turtles in Time.
2138376	2142017	It was so much fun to, like, throw the foot soldiers at the screen.
2142037	2143038	I think that's the one you do it in.
2143298	2144398	And, like, it was like Battletoads.
2144419	2145719	You could do it in the first one, too.
2145899	2146179	Okay.
2146379	2157624	I was originally... This is a case where the chat room yelling out random things can have influence on us because I'm actually going to pick one from chat for my number two because I originally was going to say Rampart because that game was pretty awesome.
2157644	2158225	What's Rampart?
2158285	2158365	We...
2159502	2161263	You don't ever play arcade games, do you?
2161323	2162063	I'm young.
2162383	2166746	It was kind of Tetris-y because you would rotate pieces to build a wall.
2167066	2168166	But they have it on PlayStation 3.
2168707	2169487	I don't see why they can't have it.
2169527	2170988	So I'll take it off since it's on PlayStation 3.
2171548	2177131	I'm going to say, I love this idea, NBA Jam totally needs to be on Xbox Live.
2177151	2180172	It needs to have the codes, though, for the Mortal Kombat characters.
2180212	2181333	That game was so good.
2181353	2186015	That could totally work, too, because Midway puts a bunch of stuff on Mario Kart.
2186075	2187076	I want NBA Jam.
2187116	2187516	Fuck yeah.
2188243	2189303	I'm putting NBA Jam down.
2189343	2190003	Thank you, Actdeft.
2191724	2193664	Number one pick, DarkSakura.
2194064	2194904	Radiant Silvergun.
2195564	2196185	Ooh, good pick.
2196245	2197005	Radiant Silvergun.
2197485	2199005	Because it's freaking treasure.
2199345	2200165	It's treasure.
2201626	2206466	And by the way, I do agree with GS68 for Blazing Star, but no.
2207447	2209607	It's got to be Radiant Silvergun.
2210387	2211687	All right.
2212028	2213408	Loki, your number one pick.
2214048	2214368	You know...
2214949	2221571	I had a couple things, and I just thought of my second pick, but I can't remember what the game's called, so whatever.
2222392	2224612	So my number one pick's going to be Simpsons, the arcade game.
2225353	2226653	Oh, good pick, good pick.
2226733	2232575	My number two, instead of Metal Slug, should have been, and I can't remember, those hentai puzzle games I kept playing.
2232595	2235436	Because those are fun.
2235456	2237057	The hentai kicks thing.
2237137	2239058	I remember what it was called, though.
2239098	2240598	You should have just said Gal's Panic.
2241018	2242539	That's what it was, Gal's Panic.
2243823	2247385	Will we allow Loki to remove Metal Slug and put in Gal's Panic?
2248185	2248666	Sure.
2249046	2249646	All right, fine.
2249666	2253368	We will allow Metal Slug to come off the list in favor of Gal's Panic.
2254089	2254549	There you go.
2254629	2255349	Gal's Panic.
2256450	2259131	That's the first time we've ever done that on a listless segment, by the way.
2259151	2260352	Allowed that to get changed.
2260412	2260712	All right.
2261653	2264714	Mikotov, you looked a little pissed off when Loki took Simpsons, the arcade game.
2264734	2266015	Did you come up with a new number one?
2266277	2270798	I'm trying so hard, but that's all the arcade games I played.
2271158	2273399	Shall we go to the chat rooms for some ideas?
2273419	2274079	Let me look at them.
2274419	2276880	Would you like me to read some to you?
2276920	2280261	I can't credit all these because a lot of folks are just yelling them out.
2280781	2287483	Super Offroad, Moonwalker Arcade, Dungeons & Dragons, Shadows Over Mysteria.
2290684	2291944	Can I pick a ticket game?
2292524	2293745	No, you can't do a ticket game.
2295583	2297304	No, there was this... Crazy Climber.
2298664	2300264	No, there was this game that everybody played.
2300284	2302385	Street Fighter 2 without getting fucked up.
2302445	2308467	It was by Midway, and it had like a joystick and a trackball, and it was like a third-person shooter type game.
2308487	2309367	The Grid.
2309387	2310187	The Grid, yeah.
2310207	2310847	You want The Grid?
2310867	2311507	Yeah, I want The Grid.
2311748	2312488	All right, The Grid.
2312508	2313788	We just talked about that earlier in the show.
2313828	2314168	Where were you?
2314188	2316929	Well, I was drooling over a guy at Starbucks.
2318089	2318669	My fault.
2319750	2321150	All right, yeah, yeah.
2321170	2323371	Shane comes back in here and goes, you guys want anything from Starbucks?
2323431	2324391	I'm like, they're going backwards.
2325945	2332407	My number one pick would be Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, because that game was awesome!
2333288	2335149	Especially with Dance Puzzle Jojo.
2335449	2336069	And why not?
2336149	2339170	Because they have Street Fighter 2 up, why not give us Puzzle Fighter 2?
2339210	2341391	Probably because the joystick sucks?
2344693	2348715	That's funny, because Actdeft said that again in chat, but I actually had that written down before he said that.
2349035	2351436	Actdeft and I are on very similar wavelengths tonight, apparently.
2351994	2352574	So there you have it.
2352614	2358196	Here's the list as it stands so far before the elimination part of this list.
2358876	2376702	We have Arcade R-Type, Bionic Commando, X-Men, Quiz and Dragons, Planet Harrier, Gauss Panic, Turtles in Time, NBA Jam, Radiant Silvergun, Simpsons, The Grid, and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.
2377122	2379503	Which of these games is not worthy of being on the list?
2379643	2380323	DarkSakura.
2384406	2384746	The Grid.
2386147	2387808	Oh, The Grid gets denied.
2387828	2389169	I'm not very fond of that game.
2389349	2393371	Nikolatov says, you know what, I pulled that out of my ass anyway, so I'm okay with that elimination.
2393431	2396573	Loki, which of these games does not deserve to be on the list?
2399755	2401316	You know, I would actually say...
2403055	2408399	Well, NBA Jam, just because there's no way they would be able to... I mean, it would be nice, but they can't do it!
2408920	2409700	Blame EA!
2409761	2413163	They have the rights to the NBA franchise for years and years and years.
2413564	2416726	Well, actually, no, they do it to... No, that's the NFL, not the NBA, right?
2417247	2417907	Oh, you're right, you're right.
2418187	2418748	My mistake.
2418928	2420689	So, it should stay!
2420729	2421670	Yeah, fine, it'll stay.
2421730	2422931	Woo!
2423252	2427395	Radiant Silvergun, because there's going to be already Ikaruga and a bunch of other shit coming to LiveRK.
2427435	2429076	Radiant Silvergun is unique!
2430470	2430850	It's gone.
2432311	2432411	Oh.
2433232	2433852	Any more, please?
2434612	2435333	Okay.
2435853	2436693	No donut for you.
2436734	2438154	Bye-bye, Radiant Silvergun.
2438214	2439015	Nice knowing you.
2439115	2439455	All right.
2440115	2442957	And it's funny because chat room was like, fuck you, Loki, fuck you, Loki.
2442997	2444578	And then I retract that, fuck you.
2445879	2447459	Miklatov, which of these comes off the list?
2449020	2449260	Oh, yeah.
2449280	2452322	Miklatov, which one of these does not deserve to be on the list?
2453022	2455864	Quiz and Dragons because it's too nerdy for that list.
2456905	2457445	I kind of...
2457975	2462797	I kind of accepted the fact that Quiz and Dragons would come off the list, so I'm okay with that.
2464438	2469601	And I will help Jamie out and take a little revenge on Loki, but not how you think.
2469681	2472022	I'm going to take off Bionic Commando, because come on.
2472702	2475083	He couldn't even tell me what was different from the NES version.
2475103	2477324	It had better graphics, that's it.
2477484	2479465	No, the NES version is awesome.
2479525	2482187	It's like, what's the difference between Contra and Contra in the arcade?
2482207	2483547	It has better graphics, that's it.
2483987	2485068	That's the only one you need.
2485458	2486439	Arcade R-Type X-Men
2502981	2511683	Planet Harrier, Gal's Panic, Turtles in Time, NBA Jam, Simpsons, or Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.
2511983	2520125	The way this works is you're going to send your number one and your number two pick in a private message to Sky in our chat room, only if you're listening live.
2520165	2523726	You send your number one and your number two pick clearly labeled.
2524066	2525646	That helps us break any ties.
2526007	2526687	So there it is.
2527847	2532008	Arcade R-Type, X-Man, Planet Harrier, Gal's Panic, Turtles in Time, NBA Jam, Simpsons,
2532375	2536417	Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, what arcade game should they port next to Xbox Live Arcade?
2536437	2537717	We'll have the results later in the show.
2537798	2543360	It's a good thing you said the X-Men game because the other game I would have mentioned was the Avengers game.
2544501	2551564	Because the Avengers game, I've been, like everybody knows I've been getting back into my whole obsession with Captain America and I love the Avengers.
2552284	2554885	So I've been like actually downloading them.
2555406	2558247	We actually played that the other day, the old game.
2559790	2565434	I was going to say, I don't think they would put Gals Panic on Live Arcade because it's too pornographic for them.
2566154	2567275	It's a fun game, though.
2567475	2569117	They could do Girls of Xbox.
2569837	2575681	Well, they have the one that's not Gals Panic, but it's like Gals Panic, but in 3D.
2576181	2579784	It's not nudity, but it's just scantily clad animation.
2579964	2580985	It's Bra and Panties.
2581125	2581665	Exactly.
2581725	2582686	The Bra and Panties game.
2582706	2584787	You should have just called it that.
2584848	2588330	If you can have Dead or Alive, Extreme Beach, Volleyball, whatever, then you can have that.
2588996	2591357	I have an engagement somewhere else.
2591437	2592198	I'll tell you offline.
2613575	2615836	because you're more than invited, which I told you about before.
2615856	2617176	OLR Extreme Beach Volleyball.
2617256	2619196	OLR Extreme Beach Volleyball, I think not.
2619396	2621037	If you want to see me in a Speedo, you need help.
2621057	2622377	I played volleyball in high school.
2622917	2623257	Did you?
2623598	2624238	Yes, I did.
2624898	2630279	Because I don't know why they always make me the server because I was short and I couldn't spike.
2630899	2633160	You played volleyball in high school, Shane?
2633220	2634400	Wow.
2634780	2637461	But was it sunny enough in Kansas to actually play volleyball?
2637861	2638822	Oh, it was indoor volleyball.
2640422	2640662	All right.
2641249	2642910	I played Marching Band.
2643350	2643971	That was my sport.
2643991	2644891	I was in Marching Band, too.
2645071	2645571	And your book.
2646452	2650514	Something else I played a lot of in high school that I haven't played a lot of since is Earthworm Jim.
2650954	2651615	And guess what?
2652095	2660219	Dave Perry, the shiny entertainment founder, has hinted that a new Earthworm Jim game is going to, quote, happen eventually.
2660719	2663361	Apparently, they have put together the pieces of the development team...
2664149	2666872	to revive this game that originally came out in 1994.
2667692	2670315	You might remember it was the game where you could launch cows.
2670615	2672016	And I remember the burping theme song.
2672036	2673317	It went, Earthworm Jim.
2673497	2676119	Like somebody burped the title and they recorded it.
2676320	2678922	Because that's how mature Earthworm Jim was of a game.
2679402	2681144	I think it would be kind of fun to see that come back.
2681224	2683806	Why do I have a feeling this might be an Xbox Live Arcade title?
2685207	2686848	Does it scream Xbox Live to anyone else?
2687229	2687729	Is it just me?
2687749	2688830	I don't know.
2689951	2690251	It does.
2690572	2691012	We'll see.
2692344	2698628	So, um, they did, didn't they do like a 3D remake of it or something like that that came out on the PSP or something?
2698668	2700669	You're thinking of Bubsy, I think.
2701049	2702670	No, no, I'm thinking Earthworm Jim.
2702910	2703150	Yeah.
2703250	2703651	I don't know.
2704071	2706632	There was like a quasi 3D remake or something.
2706652	2710735	No, somebody, I just, yeah, ew, 3D Earthworm Jim, the new Earthworm Jim better be 2D.
2711115	2712816	So apparently there was one, I just never played it.
2712896	2713836	I guess that's a good thing.
2714637	2719880	Anyways, so, um, well, Earthworm Jim, you know, it's a great game.
2720922	2724145	The question is, how do you get your girlfriend to play games with you?
2724725	2727167	Speaking of which, you have excellent timing.
2727668	2729790	There is a list that's been posted on the internet.
2729810	2732051	How to get your girlfriend to play video games with you.
2733613	2735614	You put lots of naked people in it.
2736335	2739878	You put things that she likes in it and not things you like in it.
2740038	2740519	I don't know.
2741459	2744242	Number one, they say find out if your girlfriend has ever played video games.
2744482	2749126	She may not be a full-blown gamer, but she may have played Mario games when she was younger.
2749881	2774817	and she may play games on the internet and stuff like that to remind your girlfriend that if you both play games you'll be able to spend even more quality time together bullshit pick out games she might like if you're not 100% sure she'll enjoy it you can rent it try to choose a game or system that isn't too confusing and doesn't require short reaction time because girls are feeble minded apparently
2775467	2776668	That's what I was just thinking.
2776708	2780210	Oh, because my female brain can't figure out these buttons.
2780610	2783212	The voice you're hearing, by the way, is Loki's wife, Nellie.
2783352	2783972	Oh, I'm sorry.
2784012	2784613	Hi, I'm Nellie.
2784773	2785133	That's right.
2785333	2787214	And I'm retarded because I can't figure out buttons.
2787274	2788535	What do I do with this?
2788695	2789856	I don't know.
2790556	2792297	Where does the thingy go?
2793338	2796500	If you can, get a game that is multiplayer, optimally co-op.
2796880	2799522	And it says, consider your girlfriend's personality when picking out a game.
2799962	2803865	Some girls may prefer brightly colored, all-ages games like Katamari...
2804915	2808076	Bustamove, Lego, Star Wars, Sims, or any Mario game.
2808316	2816079	But remember, if your girlfriend is an individual who could just as well go for Halo, Resident Evil, Grand Theft Auto, or Nelly's case, Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball 2.
2816959	2822201	Don't get games that involve things like strippers, prostitutes, sex, unless she has a sense of humor about the subject.
2823001	2827283	Well, yeah, it's a good thing that they added the sense of humor thing, but I was about to disagree.
2828677	2830159	Have fun when you play with her.
2830799	2832741	If you make a good time, she'll enjoy it.
2833221	2836905	Even if she's not into games and yadda yadda yadda.
2837325	2840148	And basically, I don't know.
2840768	2842149	So they have a whole bunch of tips out there.
2842189	2843591	It's on wikihow.com.
2843631	2847454	Get your girlfriend to play video games if you're really interested.
2849075	2853359	I just say, like Nellie said, make sure that there's porn in there or something.
2854861	2855341	Incentives.
2856209	2858410	Get Rez with the Transvibrator.
2858630	2859090	There you go.
2860091	2860371	All right.
2860391	2866013	Well, every week on this program, DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet up and down and left and right and back and forth.
2866513	2875737	Whatever the DDR steps are that she's dancing to this week will be the World Wide Web Surfing to find the website of the week to share with you all here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2875777	2877618	So, DarkSakura, what is your website of the week?
2878658	2879359	You picked it out.
2880139	2880779	I helped.
2881399	2882260	You asked for ideas.
2882340	2883040	I gave you ideas.
2883280	2885281	But it would have been one that I would have used.
2885866	2888848	It's PotterPuppetPals.com, which I think was down for a while.
2889508	2895112	And really, it's just the ones that came out in the actual puppet version.
2895932	2900915	With the sexy Snape animation and the muggle pants animation and stuff like that.
2901576	2902376	PotterPuppetPals.
2902396	2904558	It's Snape!
2904638	2905518	Let's bother him!
2906359	2908580	Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother!
2910121	2911642	Is that just PotterPuppetPals.com?
2911662	2912162	Yeah.
2912843	2913103	All right.
2913598	2915019	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2941434	2946459	as well as some episodic content, new modes and maps and whatnot.
2947299	2948020	So that's kind of cool.
2948721	2963614	And apparently on March 23rd, coinciding with the European launch, they're going to launch the two multiplayer modes, which is team conversion, basically the conversion mode with teams, and assault, where you destroy your team's defending base.
2964475	2967918	And they're also adding a spectator camera mode as well,
2969235	2975159	And, um, later on we should be getting some more story elements, um, in the form of episodic content.
2975299	2978861	So, I'm glad to see that they're actually doing some stuff with this game, because it is pretty awesome game.
2978921	2984084	It's just, you know, once you finish with it, I guess multiplayer is the only thing left for you.
2984564	2987266	Like, you can go back through the game and get some more weapons, but that's about it.
2988126	2988466	Fun, though.
2990668	2995831	Alrighty, well, we're going to open up our Skype line here very soon, so you guys can interact with our program.
2995851	2997652	We had a couple people calling in during part A.
2998268	2998488	877-GAME-OLR
3023920	3026742	Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.
3026922	3028223	Number three was your number two pick.
3028883	3034427	Your number two pick was NBA Jam was the number two pick you would like to see.
3035048	3038770	And number one, honestly, this isn't much of a shock to me.
3039210	3042773	I think it was based on the same hardware, lovable characters.
3043654	3047916	The Simpsons is the number one game you guys want to see on the Xbox Live market.
3047956	3048837	And they're still talking about that.
3048857	3049818	They might do that, too.
3050058	3050578	Yay.
3050618	3050938	Really?
3051099	3053100	Yeah, because with the movie coming out and everything.
3054046	3054566	It might happen.
3054907	3057748	By the way, I just want to point out, Turtles in Time, very, very close.
3057868	3059529	One vote away from making it onto the list.
3059589	3062411	So that was another one you guys wanted to see.
3062691	3065713	But every entry on the list at least got a little bit of love.
3066113	3067314	So there you have it.
3067454	3068254	Tonight's list list.
3068654	3070215	Thank you, chat room, for playing along.
3070235	3078600	If you're listening to this on your iPod, your Zooms, your PSPs, whatever the case may be, and you want to play along next time, you've got to join us live for a taping.
3078660	3081922	It's Sunday nights over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3082617	3086339	Shall we open up the Skype line and take a look at what our callers have to say?
3086580	3087280	Let's shall.
3087440	3088141	Let's do it.
3088961	3090502	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3090542	3090962	Who's this?
3092503	3093244	Hey, we're back.
3093484	3094525	Paradox Vincent.
3095145	3096146	Hi, Paradox Vincent.
3096166	3097006	What's on your mind, buddy?
3099127	3099908	Not much.
3100448	3104791	I just got another Beatmania game, 10th style.
3105552	3107713	And I just want to shout out a quick review for it.
3107893	3108273	Oh, sure.
3108373	3109534	Beatmania 10th style.
3109554	3110935	Now, this is an import game, right?
3112475	3116077	Yeah, it's an import game, so I have to use Swap Magic with it.
3116098	3121041	Alright, well, tell us, or you have to own a Japanese PlayStation 2, like I actually own one.
3121701	3123302	It has a lot of dust on it, but I have one.
3125484	3125844	Yeah.
3126144	3127225	Well, tell us your review.
3127245	3141515	So, uh, Be Many a Ten style, well, it has my favorite song list in it, and, uh, I heard a lot of complaints about it on, uh, just some of the various Bimani communities, but...
3142003	3143624	I didn't really see it.
3144625	3145685	What were some of the complaints?
3147707	3148187	I don't know.
3148807	3150748	I just heard that it was bad.
3151729	3153190	Just people going, this sucks.
3154671	3156572	You can't ever take that for an answer, though.
3156592	3158513	You can't let somebody go, this sucks.
3158633	3159093	Why?
3159153	3160074	Why does it suck?
3162616	3169940	The only thing that I ever heard about that was legitimate was that it's where the difficulty really started ramping up.
3171028	3183032	There are a few songs in there where the difficulty just starts getting a little intense, but overall, I mean, I think it has the best song list out of the releases that I've played.
3184512	3187093	It does have a pretty solid song list, I remember that.
3187173	3190674	What types of songs would Bomani fans be happy to know are in the game?
3193034	3197436	Well, there was Ixion by Leadlight, and there...
3199093	3200714	There was a lot of Sampling Masters.
3200794	3202474	Sampling Masters was really heavy in there.
3202854	3205195	There was both Rattle the Mercury and Rattle the Sun.
3207456	3210416	Some Sampling Masters, ISF, 108, Daddy Daddy.
3212437	3214698	It was really... It was a talk heavy...
3216445	3217686	There was a lot of talk songs in there.
3217706	3221148	It depends, because I'm training somebody right now, and they seem to really like it and be able to play a lot of them.
3221168	3222489	But if you've never played before...
3242708	3251230	I'd say maybe this one's just a little too hard, because after maybe the first five songs, the difficulty starts to ramp up a bit.
3251830	3256611	So, maybe not TenStyle, but TenStyle would be an awesome second or third game.
3257211	3258332	Alright, well there you have it.
3258352	3260112	Any final thoughts for our listeners, ParadoxVincent?
3262692	3269334	On a comment on the getting girls to play games segment, I just said,
3271511	3281913	Actually, some of the games that I found worked really good were Katamari and DDR, actually, but no Rez.
3282973	3283693	Rez didn't work?
3285594	3286514	Rez doesn't work for anything.
3286534	3287394	Even with the attachment?
3289054	3289254	Huh?
3289594	3291475	Even with the trans-fibrator attachment?
3293615	3296856	Well, I don't know about the trans-fibrator attachment.
3296916	3298256	Maybe you need to have her take a second look.
3300613	3301013	Maybe.
3301033	3301433	Oh, I will.
3321079	3322980	I guess there's just a difference, though.
3323461	3329004	I think when we read these stories about how do we get girls into gaming, they mean the casual gaming girl, I think.
3329124	3333947	Not the hardcore gamer nerds, you know, like you and I, regardless of sex and all that.
3334567	3334867	I don't know.
3335588	3337749	All right, let's go back to the phone lines, take another call.
3339010	3340631	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3340671	3341031	Who's this?
3342452	3343653	Good evening, this is DMN.
3343893	3344673	Hi, DMN.
3344693	3345714	God, you get through every week.
3345754	3346254	What's on your mind?
3347215	3347275	Um...
3348584	3349384	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3375830	3378251	Not so much as On Tour, which I really didn't like.
3379372	3380032	It's $50.
3380493	3381534	Definitely recommend it.
3382814	3385016	What if I've never played SSX before in my life?
3385296	3386397	What do I have to look forward to?
3389319	3394523	If this is your first SSX game, it may be a little difficult for you.
3395303	3400847	The thing that's really difficult is... Excuse me.
3401516	3408177	The thing that's really difficult in that game is moving around and doing tricks, because they do it a lot differently than you would with a DualShock 2 controller.
3409818	3417280	Once you get accustomed to that, though, as the tutorial does a great job of having you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun.
3418240	3420140	When will SEX Tricky come out?
3421500	3422461	An SEX blur.
3423641	3426742	When people don't give a shit about AO ratings.
3427662	3428382	Alright, fair enough.
3429853	3432255	Anything else that you've played this week you want to share with our listeners about?
3434397	3437620	No, I'm getting back into a leap-eat agent, so I'm getting psyched for Owen Don, too.
3437680	3439101	That's supposed to be coming out later this year.
3439181	3440122	Looks pretty sexy.
3440162	3440702	I remember that.
3440762	3443084	That news just came out recently as well.
3444085	3448769	I was going to ask you, you have not been the biggest Sony fan in the past, from what I remember.
3448809	3450390	What did you think about their announcements this week?
3451111	3452492	I'm excited for them.
3453012	3454694	The PlayStation Home looks fantastic.
3454894	3457576	Yeah, I could play the rip-off card, but I'm not going to.
3459187	3460788	LittleBigPlanet looks awesome.
3462909	3470534	Not something that's going to make me drop $600 on a PS3, but it's a great idea, and I really hope it gets off the ground.
3471775	3472075	All right.
3472835	3474636	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners, DMN?
3475937	3476157	Yes.
3476798	3481441	We're introducing over the next month a new segment, a new recorded segment after SDFU.
3481501	3483822	It is the month of March, March Madness of Basketball.
3484482	3488685	So I thought I'd throw together a little tournament called DDR Madness.
3489704	3491005	64 DDR and In The Groove songs.
3491305	3493326	You guys vote to determine which is the best one.
3494766	3497407	But if it's DDR madness, why do you have In The Groove songs in it?
3497447	3500188	Shouldn't it be like Dance Game Madness or something like that?
3500888	3501148	Sure.
3501248	3502449	We'll call it Dance Game Madness.
3502489	3502909	Why not?
3502949	3503429	Thank you.
3503729	3504049	Yay.
3504189	3505210	I had an effect on the world.
3505810	3506130	All right.
3506430	3509351	Listen to STFU Thursday night, 7 o'clock, right here on OLR.
3509391	3509591	Yes?
3510232	3510492	Yes.
3510832	3511072	All right.
3511849	3514330	and it's podcasted now, so you don't have an excuse not to listen.
3514470	3515210	Sweet, is it really?
3515250	3516470	Do we finally get that on our servers?
3516911	3517391	Yes, we do.
3517451	3519731	We have the pilot episode and episode 12 up right now.
3519991	3520352	Awesome.
3520452	3522132	Are we going to get all the episodes on the stream?
3522752	3525013	Yes, I'm going to release an old one and a new one every week.
3525813	3526213	Sweet.
3526553	3528394	All right, check that out, Orange Launch Radio.
3528734	3529834	What's the podcast feed?
3530094	3530915	Is it in iTunes yet?
3531775	3536656	Yeah, stfu.orangelunchradio.com slash rss, I believe.
3536756	3538697	I'll find the link and post it in the chat.
3539042	3539322	Great.
3539823	3542905	That will do us no good for the folks listening on the podcast right now.
3543766	3545387	Can they search it in iTunes or somewhere yet?
3546027	3547368	I believe it's up in iTunes now.
3547689	3547989	Sweet.
3548009	3548850	All right.
3548890	3549670	Well, good luck to you, DMN.
3550191	3550431	All right.
3550471	3550831	Thanks, man.
3550951	3551151	Later.
3551712	3551932	Bye.
3552132	3552372	Bye.
3552973	3553393	All right.
3553413	3553893	Sweet.
3554514	3557116	Let's go to at least one more call here.
3557516	3558497	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3558517	3558877	Who's this?
3560659	3561679	It's Legend of Zaku.
3561879	3562880	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
3562900	3563561	What's on your mind, buddy?
3565282	3567504	Just ranting on the Internet.
3568348	3578317	In particular, how people are just bitching and moaning about how one PS3 game, Unreal Tournament 3, is actually getting keyboard and mouse support.
3578777	3583621	I would like to see that as an iTunes review, by the way, as an iTunes review of this program.
3584122	3585603	It's just ranting on the internets.
3586283	3588645	Yeah.
3588685	3589186	Sorry, go ahead.
3589847	3605861	As you know, they're saying that it's going to give, you know, PC gamers who basically grew up on keyboard and mouse, myself, it's going to give them an advantage over the folks who use Nexus just to play the game, and there's just some back and forth arguing.
3606041	3606942	Well, what do you think?
3607022	3610445	Is it really that big a deal, or should people just shut up about it, or what?
3611105	3617751	The only exceptions to, you know, the only good controls that I've seen so far, you know, in console first-person shooters...
3618709	3620030	His golden eye in Perfect Dark.
3620350	3620690	That's it.
3621530	3627853	Because they had the benefit of the joystick on the N64 and it actually felt nice on your hands.
3629574	3637918	Whereas, you know, stuff like Halo, honestly, you know, personally I found it really hard to just, you know, to actually aim.
3638659	3644361	And I found that very difficult with every other first person shooter that I've seen on the console.
3644541	3645722	It was just horrible.
3646414	3650576	But now that they had a keyboard and mouse, it's easier for me to transition.
3653477	3668102	But then on the other side, you could actually use 6-axis to basically aim up and down, and then you could just use the D-pad to move forward, backwards, side to side.
3668262	3674664	Since you brought up Halo, there are current existing 360 games that will use any USB keyboard.
3674704	3676245	Final Fantasy XI is what I'm thinking of.
3676661	3682904	Do you think that Halo 3 ought to accept a mouse and a keyboard, USB mouse and USB keyboard as possible control devices?
3683765	3686046	Just to throw the PC gamers a bone, at least.
3687006	3692429	Because, you know, they're still out there and that would pretty much be on getting Halo 3 if it had that.
3693390	3702914	I could just hook up a mouse and keyboard and then I could just play in my own comfort zone without having to go through hell trying to learn the controls and trying to be good at them.
3703435	3704115	Hmm, interesting.
3704810	3706811	Alright, well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
3707891	3712253	Maximum Tune pawns Initial D, that's all I have to say.
3712853	3713193	Alright.
3714614	3714974	What's that?
3717275	3718195	What, Maximum Tune?
3718375	3727919	Oh, I thought you said you wanted to comment on Initial D. No, I said Maximum Tune is greater than Initial D. Certainly when it comes to the soundtrack, I would agree.
3728419	3731660	Oh yeah, that too, and the fact that it's more real than Initial D.
3732210	3737712	Alright, well, Racing Game fans, if you disagree with Zaku, call him at home.
3738632	3739533	But I can't give you the number.
3739673	3739953	Alright.
3740633	3742034	Thanks, Zaku, for your call, as always.
3742094	3742554	Take care, buddy.
3743194	3743474	Bye.
3743634	3743874	Bye.
3744775	3745995	Alright, let's go to the next call.
3746055	3747215	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3747235	3747616	Who's this?
3748976	3750977	It's Ranma, the official spoken at a chat room.
3750997	3751837	What's up, everyone?
3751997	3752778	Hello, Ranma.
3752798	3753938	How are you doing, my friend?
3755140	3756360	I'm doing good.
3756520	3757941	How is everybody else over there?
3758561	3758941	I'm okay.
3758961	3760301	The other two are kind of quiet tonight.
3760341	3762122	They don't want to participate in phone calls tonight.
3762162	3762762	I don't know what's going on.
3762782	3765583	I'm doing fine, just have, you know, a lot in my mind.
3765683	3768203	They're having chat room sex online, actually.
3768263	3768643	No!
3768743	3769764	I'm trying to take calls here.
3770384	3771204	No.
3771384	3773644	But then, you know what, DarkSakura, you talk to Ranma.
3773905	3774285	Hi, Ranma.
3774325	3775225	I have to go pee anyway.
3775265	3775865	You talk to Ranma.
3776205	3778226	Oh, that's really fucking good radio, Rob.
3779326	3780086	Way to go.
3780106	3780826	He needs to go pee.
3781106	3783107	Yeah, he's just, yeah, way to go, Rob.
3783167	3783867	Go to the bathroom.
3785715	3786375	What a wuss.
3787796	3788496	What a wuss.
3790157	3790697	So hi.
3790717	3792797	Hey.
3793197	3793898	What's on your mind?
3793918	3794698	I got a question.
3795058	3795218	What?
3795238	3796178	I got a question for you.
3796859	3799019	What?
3800040	3813284	I read an article on Consumer sometime back about people complaining about GameStop, the fact that they open up the video games and put it on display, and then when they sell them, they sell them at the full price, they'd rather knock a couple bucks off.
3814775	3815856	What do you think about that?
3816096	3819459	Well, first of all, I have no affiliation with GameStop whatsoever anymore.
3820779	3821860	That's fine, I'm just saying.
3822481	3826844	But honestly, they don't do that with all of their games.
3826884	3828525	That's like the last one.
3828886	3830206	And it hasn't been played.
3830627	3834109	The disc has not been physically touched on the thing.
3834129	3835931	It has not been inside of the system.
3836331	3838853	It is an unused game.
3839013	3840754	It is only that the case has been opened.
3842516	3843036	Correct.
3843256	3844257	You're right on that, but
3844773	3856201	I guess from my point of view from working retail, it seems like it belongs in an open box status where you want still new, it's open, and technically you really can't say it's new so you're going to knock a couple of dollars off.
3856502	3858563	It's sort of like a shades of gray when you think about it.
3858763	3863827	I think open box really should apply to like hardware, like appliances.
3863907	3872013	It's the same thing with demo machines as well, but I remember a friend of mine, my friend Patty, we were looking for a game.
3872333	3873094	We found it.
3873703	3886071	but they wouldn't knock like a couple bucks off because it was like a display box you know they took the game out and all of that and the boxes are a little bit faded I mean they could at least get something well I think that um
3886727	3887687	Well, okay, look at it this way.
3887988	3898311	If ever you go to the bookstore and you have books that are shrink-wrapped, you know, but you have books that are unwrapped, they're still going to sell you the book at the same price unless the book itself is damaged.
3898912	3907295	If the game is not damaged, if the case is not damaged, then there's no reason for them to make any differentiation between it.
3910176	3913137	You're right, but it's just that some people argue about that.
3913570	3918134	I mean, it's one of the reasons I try not to shop at GameStop unless I really have to, you know?
3918855	3924340	Well, I don't shop at GameStop anymore at all, so don't blame me there.
3925461	3926181	Go to GameCrazy.
3926241	3929344	There's no GameCrazy down here in New York.
3929664	3930505	Not that I know of.
3930905	3932507	This should be attached to a Hollywood video.
3933214	3933734	if you got them.
3934935	3937556	We have a Hollywood video, but there is no GameCrazy there.
3937797	3940718	That's sad.
3940958	3946321	Well, GameCrazy sells old games, and that's why I love them.
3947202	3948582	Not just because Dan works there.
3949863	3951384	Well, it works for me, definitely.
3953425	3955826	Alright, well, is there anything else, Ranma?
3957207	3958708	I want to call you out, Sky.
3958768	3961289	I'm tired of you talking trash about Vista.
3961529	3962790	I don't, I'm tired of it.
3963320	3967222	I'm not really talking a lot of trash about Vista, I'm just not that interested in it.
3968743	3975207	Yeah, but the thing is, Windows XP, every box of XP is coming out, oh, new upgrades, brand new hardware.
3975447	3982271	By the time the new OS came out, it's definitely time to upgrade, because it's been like maybe two or three years since the last upgrade.
3982491	3989475	Since it was Vista, it's been a while since, you know, the last operating system was XP, so you got newer hardware for Vista to support.
3990020	3992161	and people complain about bugs left and right.
3992482	3999166	A lot of those bugs do not even apply unless you're like a hardcore higher end user doing stuff you shouldn't even be doing.
4000107	4001548	Why should I upgrade to Vista?
4003549	4011054	Well, personally because there are newer hardware that's coming out that XP may not be able to support and the fact that XP and Vista
4011664	4013985	is more secure, is more stable.
4034602	4035583	We're perfectly honest.
4035723	4039167	I can't say now because if that was the case, I'd be very updated.
4039628	4041089	Drew, he's already updated.
4041209	4054644	I'm waiting a month before I get all my hardware ready to go because I want to really try out this copy that's out in stores because I shouldn't be really saying this, but I was a beta tester and I've been playing around with it since it was mobile and I've seen...
4055219	4059342	The changes from 2004 all the way up to now.
4059442	4061404	Ranma, I got to be honest, you're not selling it to me.
4061484	4064607	I mean, you're telling me that because everyone else is doing it, I should do it.
4066328	4067629	I'm doing the best that I can.
4067649	4069170	I work retail, you know.
4069210	4076676	I know you don't work for... Look, let me tell you straight up, honestly, if you don't want to upgrade to Vista, that's fine.
4076716	4078418	I mean, to each his own.
4078518	4081600	Me, personally, I plan to do the upgrade in due time.
4081920	4083902	XP is still going to be around for a couple of years.
4084426	4086568	All right.
4087889	4094055	I'm going to read some chat comments on this and then wrap up here.
4094355	4098078	I see James Patrick says, you can control audio for every separate program in Vista.
4098138	4099580	Trying to help you out there with some good reasons.
4100761	4101181	Let's see.
4102042	4102422	What was it?
4102462	4105345	Somebody said they are on Windows.
4105405	4106986	Oh, NM64 says, Vista?
4107066	4108288	Heck, I still prefer Windows 2000.
4108328	4108688	There you go.
4110612	4114395	Alright, well Ranma, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.
4114455	4115956	Any last words for our listeners?
4117937	4119758	Listen to Uni's radio on Shoutcat.
4119798	4122500	I don't remember the name of it, but she should be posting it in the chat room.
4123040	4124862	Alright, I'm sure she appreciates the plug.
4124882	4125262	Take care.
4125902	4126923	No problem.
4126943	4128664	But don't listen to it right now, because we're on the air.
4131606	4132207	Alright, take care.
4132587	4134909	Alright, thanks so much for the call, and...
4136133	4137854	We're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line now.
4137894	4140675	Thank you so much to those of you that got through tonight and participated in the show.
4141095	4142255	We appreciate it, as always.
4142675	4145276	I'm going to go around and ask if there's any last-minute stories.
4145936	4146777	DarkSakura, anything?
4148017	4149217	Not particularly.
4149758	4152559	Just, you know, I'd like to remind everybody that I'm really awesome.
4153399	4154559	And, okay.
4155320	4156180	That's not a story.
4156320	4156700	Loki.
4157580	4160361	There was a thing that's coming out in Japan that's actually kind of funny.
4160481	4165463	It's a painting program for the DS, and you basically paint, like,
4166844	4171085	A Japanese man has blamed his 6-axis for a new impotence problem.
4197888	4200970	Um, Mr. Owie, what's his name?
4201170	4204032	Owie Bailey says he cannot get an erection anymore.
4204532	4209835	He says having his controller in his lap in close proximity to his penis has left him unable to perform.
4210235	4214277	He thinks the controller is sending out a Bluetooth frequency that can cause bodily harm.
4214858	4220260	He has contacted Sony to find out if he is not the only one having a problem from the PlayStation 3 controller, but has yet to get a response.
4220681	4223382	Bailey plans on going to the doctor this week to try to get some answers.
4223862	4226344	So, Bluetooth gives you...
4228092	4229313	Impotence, apparently.
4229833	4230914	What the hell is this?
4230994	4235557	I mean, it's not... I think he just has emotional problems, and that's why he's impotent.
4236297	4238439	Why is he trying to play the game with his penis, anyway?
4238499	4242221	It sounds like he's trying to put the controller right there to maybe, like, look at a picture of a pretty girl.
4242241	4245743	I don't know about you, but when I play the game, I don't have my hand down there.
4245863	4248265	I have the controller in my hands.
4248405	4250246	That's the Al Bundy way of playing video games.
4250286	4252228	You know, one hand down your pants, one, yeah, there you go.
4252248	4257191	I don't know, that's awfully lazy, and to be honest, I don't see that...
4258206	4258966	That's stupid.
4260007	4260947	How old is this guy?
4262128	4262668	It didn't say.
4263309	4264129	Yeah, that's what I thought.
4264749	4269772	Because I'm betting it's not anything that has to do with... Well, you know, here's what it is.
4269932	4276455	It's because the fucking imagery from the PlayStation 3 is so fucking sexy, his wife just doesn't do it for him anymore.
4277836	4282298	NintendoManiac64 wants to know, why would you put the 6-axis on your dick?
4282338	4283279	There's no rumble!
4285453	4287254	I guess that's a good question to ask.
4288455	4293019	One of the OL Army recruits, meaning they haven't changed their nickname yet, says, That's how the Power Glove was invented.
4294740	4295740	Now you're playing with power.
4295961	4296681	That's so bad.
4298102	4298422	All right.
4299703	4304827	Well, let's go around, if there's no more last-minute stories, and get everybody's final thought.
4305147	4306448	We'll start with you tonight, DarkSakura.
4306528	4307309	What's your final thought?
4308550	4309090	Give me money.
4310791	4313353	My final thought is Guinness World Records.
4314070	4314770	It's my final thought.
4314990	4316671	Because I've had like three glasses of it this week.
4316731	4317291	It's good stuff.
4317951	4319091	Loki, your final thought, please.
4319891	4325973	My final thought is it's a lot harder to put PlayStation 1 games on your PSP.
4327033	4328614	Were you successful in your attempts?
4328794	4337256	I put it on there, but the thing is you need to have a bunch of different files from Hot Shots 2 actually from the PlayStation Store.
4337656	4342997	And then because with each firmware update they change the encoding on the PS1 games, so
4343556	4344197	DarkSakura.com
