0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	27000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March 11, 2007 to be exact.
27000	33000	You might be thinking to yourself, if you're listening to this on your iPod or your Zune or whatever it is, your Zen that you have right now,
33000	38000	you might be thinking, or your PSP, you might be thinking, wait a minute, it's way past March 11, what are you talking about?
38000	42000	Well, we record live on Sunday nights and then split up our show into two segments,
42000	46000	because we talk a lot here at Orange Lounge Radio and a lot about games, of course.
46000	53000	And we split it up into two segments and offer it on the podcast stream on Mondays and Wednesdays for you to listen to throughout the week.
53000	60000	And if you guys are ready, Dark Soccer and Loki, my lovely co-host in crime, we'll get back to the gaming news.
60000	61000	Okay.
61000	65000	And we'll start it off with, that was a nice hearty okay there.
65000	66000	Okay.
66000	70000	We'll start it off with the Nintendo keynote from Gay Developers Conference,
70000	76000	because we talked a lot in part eight about the Sony keynote and how Sony's winning a lot of people back over thanks to their announcements about home.
76000	78000	Well, what about Nintendo?
78000	84000	Well, Nintendo basically made only two unveilings in their conference at GDC,
84000	88000	and that was a new Mario Galaxy trailer and the fact that it would be out this year,
88000	93000	and a type of, I don't know what you'd want to call it, Mii Idol or something like that,
93000	100000	basically a do you like this Mii, it's like a Mii popularity channel has been announced for the Nintendo Wii.
100000	103000	Not a lot of announcements outside of that, but then again, a lot of people are saying,
103000	108000	ah Nintendo you guys suck, Sony made all these announcements and Nintendo you didn't do crap.
108000	111000	Well, keep in mind folks, it was Game Developers Conference.
111000	113000	What did Miyamoto talk about?
113000	119000	He talked about the WIFO meter, he talked about how Mario 128 kind of evolved into the game Peekman,
119000	121000	he talked about game development types of things.
121000	124000	On that end, Nintendo really didn't disappoint I don't think.
124000	129000	But, you know, if you were there looking for the E3 Bang and Fireworks press conference,
129000	131000	I guess you were going to be a little disappointed.
131000	136000	But of course we remember that story last week that said, hey Nintendo's got some stock things going on,
136000	140000	they're not going to be able to make any big announcements to GDC whether they want to or not.
140000	141000	So there you have it.
141000	145000	So unfortunately the only little trinkets you got there from Nintendo were those two things.
145000	147000	But curious, what do you guys think about that?
147000	150000	Do either of you guys watch the new Galaxy trailer? What did you think of it?
150000	152000	That was okay, it just looked like Galaxy though.
152000	155000	I mean it wasn't anything different that I've seen.
155000	157000	The graphics were pretty rad.
157000	167000	I got to say I'm more excited about Super Paper Mario though after seeing some more footage of that than I am the Mario Galaxy.
167000	171000	Because it looks like you can flip 2D to 3D at the touch of a button.
171000	174000	Like if you're playing the 2D thing and you see a wheel thing.
174000	177000	There was one video I saw a wheel, a spiked wheel was coming at you.
177000	180000	You hit a button to go to 3D and then you can run around the wheel.
180000	182000	And then you go back to the 2D mode. It's so crazy.
182000	184000	I liked it. It was very cool.
184000	190000	So that was something I'm looking forward to way more than any of the other stuff that was talked about unfortunately.
190000	191000	Smash Brothers!
191000	193000	I'll give Mario Galaxy a try of course.
193000	194000	I want my Smash Brothers.
194000	195000	We'll see.
195000	199000	Again, if you want to give your comments in chat, it's chat.orangeloungelounge.
199000	200000	That's the second I've ever done this show.
200000	202000	chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com
202000	205000	I'm out of it tonight. Something's wrong.
205000	207000	There's something in the water I'm drinking tonight.
207000	211000	chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com
211000	214000	actdef says Super Paper Mario for the win.
214000	218000	BlackWolf was at Game Developers Conference and played Super Paper Mario.
218000	220000	He says Super Paper Mario equals fun.
220000	223000	The A button goes to 3D.
223000	226000	Joshi says Super Paper Mario is when I get a Wii.
226000	228000	So it looks like a lot of folks are very excited.
228000	234000	ssj100matt says yay more channels but how about Galaxy, Smash, and Metroid?
234000	237000	There's your comments from chat.
237000	242000	This week we saw some pretty good stuff coming to the Virtual Console,
242000	245000	including Super Ghouls and Ghosts.
245000	249000	That was, of course, very fucking hard as usual.
249000	252000	And of course, Sword of Vermillion.
252000	256000	And Elevator Action for the role that was on the NES.
256000	261000	And this week though, what are we going to be getting?
261000	265000	Well, from what I've been hearing, I think Sonic Spinball was among those.
265000	271000	I know it was on the Japan launch there, at least what they're getting this week.
271000	274000	And if I remember correctly, they also were getting Excite Bike
274000	277000	and Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
277000	279000	Sweet! Oh my god, I love Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
279000	281000	Serious? No, I'm like being serious.
281000	283000	I totally love that game on Super Nintendo.
283000	287000	And Turbografx-16 Fire Pro Wrestling combination tag.
287000	294000	But I know Spinball was confirmed coming out this week on the Virtual Console for Japan.
294000	296000	I can't remember about the US though.
296000	302000	Wasn't Tecmo Bowl discovered somehow, whether it be the ESRB thing or looking at the website thing?
302000	303000	I think it was on the website, yeah.
303000	306000	That's still not officially out, so maybe that is on its way.
306000	309000	I think they saw Spinball there too, if I remember correctly.
309000	310000	Interesting.
310000	311000	I can't remember.
311000	315000	But you know, you're going to expect some about three games tomorrow.
315000	316000	Or Monday.
316000	319000	Anything on Virtual Console that you were dying for still not out?
319000	321000	I mean, I got Kid Icarus, so I kind of got my wish.
321000	323000	I have R-Type.
323000	325000	I know, but anything not out that you still want.
325000	332000	I mean, obviously Guardian Legend, but realistically, something from either Nintendo itself or one of their very close third-party developers.
332000	333000	Snow Brothers.
333000	336000	Snow Brothers. That's an interesting choice.
336000	338000	I remember that game, actually.
338000	343000	I would like to see, and I know Jamie hates this one, but I really like Strider on the NES.
343000	345000	I didn't say I hated it.
345000	349000	Actually, the game was based off of the Strider manga.
349000	350000	Oh, okay.
350000	353000	But you told me once you hated it because the arcade one is so much better.
353000	354000	I didn't say I hated it.
354000	356000	I just said the arcade one is so much better.
356000	359000	Wouldn't it be neat, though, one week to get Strider on NES and Strider on Genesis?
359000	361000	That would be kind of cool, wouldn't it?
361000	362000	Yeah.
362000	364000	Mega Man would be my other wish.
364000	367000	Yeah, they need some Mega Man games on there would be pretty cool.
367000	370000	Actually, Capcom just needs some more stuff on there.
370000	372000	I would think it would be pretty cool.
372000	374000	You know, I was a fan of this game, at least.
374000	376000	Uniracers.
376000	377000	I don't know.
377000	379000	No one really played that game from Nintendo.
379000	381000	We've got a minute chat room here.
381000	382000	Of course, you know, you bring up Virtual Console.
382000	384000	Everyone makes their list of demands.
384000	387000	James Patrick says, Secret of Mana and Evermore.
387000	390000	Morrie says, Earthbound, please.
390000	391000	Ryoma says, Ice Climbers.
391000	393000	Actually, Ice Climbers is already up.
393000	394000	Go check it out.
394000	396000	Unless he was referring to something else, but I think that's the list.
396000	397000	Salamander.
397000	400000	A life force in this country, but that would be cool.
400000	402000	ActDef says, Kirby Superstar.
402000	403000	There you go.
403000	407000	Mel B on our staff says, Tecmo Bowl, but will it be licensed?
407000	408000	Not likely.
408000	412000	Just leave it in there with the old, like, 88 lineup or whatever that game had in it.
412000	413000	That would be funny.
413000	414000	Wouldn't it?
414000	415000	Mm-hmm.
415000	416000	Mm-hmm.
416000	417000	Then you could still play the 40.
417000	421000	You could play as the 49ers and actually be good because it's 1988.
421000	423000	That was a sports joke.
423000	425000	I don't make those very often.
425000	429000	It was a sports joke for you guys out there.
429000	436000	Well, for those who are disgusted with Rob's, you know, sports jokes, no, not really.
436000	439000	This has absolutely nothing to do with sports.
439000	443000	We have Chocobo Tales coming out in May in the UK.
443000	447000	That is, it's coming out April 3rd here in the U.S.
447000	454000	But you play as a Chocobo and you have to, you know, stop the bad guy from, you know,
454000	458000	I guess being all evil even though he's all evil.
458000	467000	So, you go around and you do mini games and you build up a deck in card battles and save
467000	470000	the universe on your DS through the Wi-Fi.
470000	478000	So, it's saying that it's going to be, like I said, released in May in the UK and April
478000	480000	3rd in the U.S. but it's already out in Japan.
480000	482000	I'd really like to know if anyone's already played it because I'm sort of thinking about
482000	483000	it.
483000	484000	All right.
484000	491000	In an unannounced feature, it will actually enhance your DS to smell like Chocobo, actually.
491000	494000	Kentucky Ferraga Chocobo.
494000	499000	No, but remember in, like, one of the Final Fantasy, I think it was Final Fantasy II U.S.
499000	503000	for Japan, you would have to use the big carrot when it came up on the screen that said, it
503000	506000	smells like Chocobo and you kind of always wondered, what the hell does a Chocobo smell
506000	507000	like?
507000	509000	Does it smell like farts or roses or what?
509000	511000	Smells like chicken shit.
511000	512000	Kentucky Fried Chicken?
512000	513000	What?
513000	515000	Smells like Kentucky Ferraga Chocobo.
515000	516000	Sorry.
516000	520000	Well, okay, maybe I'm full of shit on that DS feature but this is something I'm not kidding
520000	521000	you about.
521000	526000	The Opera DS browser is coming to North America on June 4th.
526000	530000	Unfortunately, you can't use Flash, you can't use video, you can't use sound, and you can't
530000	531000	use PDF.
531000	535000	But you can use the stylus and what's kind of cool is that you can have some handwriting
535000	536000	recognition there.
536000	542000	The browser will be retailing for about $32 in Japan, $52 in Europe, no price announced
542000	548000	here yet but I guess based off those prices you could speculate $34 or $39.99, right?
548000	550000	That would be a fair statement.
550000	554000	I guess something to compete with the PSP a little bit although this is not included
554000	555000	with the DS.
555000	557000	It's kind of something extra.
557000	561000	But if you've ever wanted to surf the internet while on the go on your DS, there you have
561000	562000	it.
562000	565000	I would not buy that.
565000	567000	I'm not feeling this.
567000	568000	I'm really not.
568000	573000	You know what would have been cool is if I had the internet channel on my Wii then I
573000	575000	could beam it over to my DS.
575000	576000	Where's that?
576000	577000	Whatever happened to that functionality?
577000	579000	Wasn't that something they said you could do at one point?
579000	581000	Is that the DS would interface with the Wii?
581000	586000	Well, they're going to have that with some future games but they may add that later.
586000	588000	I have a feeling that's something up their sleeve.
588000	591000	DS demos on your Wii a little later on.
591000	592000	Why not?
592000	593000	I don't know.
593000	597000	But one thing I was going to say is I think that they've done this probably better at
597000	598000	home brew.
598000	604560	I mean, really the only problem and the reason why they don't have a lot of the flash support
604560	608640	and stuff is because there's not enough RAM in the system and there's no storage.
608640	613120	It's just pretty much the cart itself which doesn't hold that much.
613120	619480	You would probably need to have some sort of Game Boy Advance thing plugged in the bottom.
619480	621760	In fact, I think that's what they did in Japan.
621760	623360	A couple different versions of that.
623360	628760	Joshie16 wants to know is there going to be an OLR DS page since we have the PSP page
628760	630280	and a Wii one in the works.
630280	631280	Probably not.
631280	632280	I can't imagine that either.
632280	633480	I don't think that many people are going to be using that.
633480	636800	Maybe like five people would use it if even that.
636800	639080	Do we even have five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?
639080	644320	I don't think we do actually so I don't think there'd be a lot of points to do that.
644320	645800	Five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?
645800	646800	Yeah.
646800	649420	I think we have more than that.
649420	650420	Maybe a handful.
650420	651420	I don't know.
651420	656220	The first episode we only had five listeners but my how we've grown since then.
656220	658480	Thank you guys so much for supporting us over the years.
658480	661200	Our fifth anniversary is coming up in just two months.
661200	664300	Two months at the station but I think we're actually going to celebrate it with the first
664300	670160	live show which was June 23, 2002.
670160	676080	Last week we talked about how the Wii didn't have Wii support for third parties.
676080	681920	This week SNK's president says that they're not letting third parties have online capabilities
681920	684440	either.
684440	690220	Which is funny because Sega's got a Pachinko game coming out that does have online and
690220	696640	does have Wii support so I basically ask are they just not letting SNK have online support
696640	701560	or Wii support because to be honest I mean and I'm sure everyone can agree with me there
701560	706820	haven't really been any new SNK games coming out other than these collections or ports
706820	714160	of older games so I don't know maybe you should make something new for a change and from what
714160	717160	I hear I guess their next game is an art of fighting you know collection.
717160	720160	I can remember that got brought up on last week's show yeah.
720160	721160	Yay.
721160	722160	All right.
722160	723160	I can't wait for that.
723160	725800	I'm sure it's going to be uber awesome.
725800	728760	Totally retro hurrah.
728760	731840	Make something new.
731840	739240	All right well let's go on to another topic shall we?
739240	743360	Well this is something that we've been of course talking about since the announcement
743360	752280	of having our E3 taken from us but there is going to be E3 this year if you were invited
752280	758520	it's July 11th through 13th to quote the invite it says the opportunity to engage in one on
758520	763920	one meetings with leading game company executives in an intimate setting as well as network
763920	768680	socialized and test pilot major company offerings.
768680	771000	Well I got invited.
771000	772000	Congratulations.
772000	780280	So if it works out for me I'm going to go but I'm actually I sort of do see more now
780280	784080	of the logic in them changing it to a more of a meeting based I think we're still going
784080	788480	to have the demos and such it's just not going to be the big over the top production that
788480	790500	you know E3 was in the past.
790500	794120	And not really many people have figured out why you know people are getting invited.
794120	797600	I was actually looking just earlier today Joystiq ran an interesting story on the whole
797600	802560	thing and apparently they're saying they said here in the story this week that some journalists
802560	807920	received their invites but many did not and interesting enough Jamie did get an invite
807920	811880	but and so did someone else on our staff who works behind the scenes.
811880	813800	But Loki and I have not.
813800	816400	So where's the love you guys?
816400	820880	I know there's some developers out there listen to us sniff sniff cry cry send us an email
820880	824800	we want to go we'll interview you have you on the show we'll play beat the host with
824800	827800	you we'll bring our rig.
827800	833000	No but I do hope you know I had a lot of fun at the E3 shows and not just you know the
833000	836120	over the top stuff but actually just getting to play the games and reporting on it so I
836120	838680	hope from that perspective we get to go.
838680	842080	But if not then we'll just rely on Jamie she'll be a one woman show.
842080	846600	No offense you know I'm from the room where we kind of speculated yesterday or how people
846600	847600	got invited.
847600	853160	It's basically if you've had meetings with people you probably got invited type thing.
853160	857080	I don't know it's just like a lot of times like we didn't go to I mean we went to meetings
857080	861800	for some things but I got a lot of accomplishments booth tours and stuff like that and actually
861800	866640	meeting people face to face instead of just you know actually having meetings and stuff.
866640	867920	Rob went to meetings with me.
867920	872040	Yeah it's at this point it's really all speculation we just don't know how they're picking it.
872040	874280	It might also have to do with how you registered.
874280	875400	Who knows?
875400	876400	I pre-registered.
876400	878680	Yeah so that was my request.
878680	884280	Some of the meetings that I went to were ones that required you to scan your card.
884280	888520	I don't know we'll see we can speculate till we're blue in the face but E3 is still a few
888520	891040	months away we shall see what happens.
891040	895400	We'll let you know the minute we hear if we're going or not we'll let you know.
895400	901000	Well shifting gears completely here going from E3 to talk about politics a little bit.
901000	907740	Game politics ran a story earlier this week about the video games made me do it defense.
907740	913960	Well apparently what happened is that this 19 year old Patrick Morris actually shot his
913960	919880	15 year old boy with a shotgun and used the good old excuse the video games made me do
919880	924720	it and his mom even you know tried to go in there and say he would just go into his room
924720	926920	and play those video games.
926920	931640	Well the prosecution brought out Dr. Michael Knapp from Ashland Oregon and he said it was
931640	934120	ridiculous to blame video games.
934120	938160	Moreover he said while you usually can't predict violent behavior other risk factors in Morris'
938160	943680	life such as his drug use and emotional disorders were much stronger factors.
943680	949240	So after 30 minutes of deliberations he she sentenced the judge sentenced Morris to life
949240	950240	in prison.
950240	954200	The video games made me do it defense carried no weight.
954200	958320	Because well it should have not had any weight because that's a stupid defense.
958320	960080	Because it's the hip hop music that did it.
960080	962320	No one made you press the power button asshole.
962320	965080	It was a hip hop music game that made me do it.
965080	966920	It's all Def Jam icons.
966920	970840	Def Jam icon absolutely.
970840	971840	But anyways.
971840	975600	Actually if anything makes me want to go out and get a shotgun and shoot people it would
975600	978040	probably be Sonic on the Playstation 3.
978040	980120	I don't know about you.
980120	981560	Please don't take me literally.
981560	984360	I hope you guys know I'm joking.
984360	991200	Well sometimes we talk about you know harming the certain beta testers of online functions
991200	995000	in say portable Grand Theft Auto games.
995000	997480	Because you fucking sucked at it.
997480	1000360	But anyways.
1000360	1004440	One thing though that's going to make people you know especially Sega make some more games
1004440	1010440	is this online poll that they have where they're trying to figure out the interests of older
1010440	1016760	franchises what people want remakes of and so far Nite seems to be winning out.
1016760	1018200	Which is pretty awesome.
1018200	1020760	That was the funniest thing I think I've ever seen.
1020760	1025680	I looked up and randomly Nelly was poking Loki in the head.
1025680	1026920	Yes.
1026920	1031840	Anyway that was really good radio.
1031840	1035080	So Nite would you like to see Nite's come back?
1035080	1036080	Oh hell yeah.
1036080	1037080	Nite's would be awesome.
1037080	1042640	And you know I think it would be really good though to move on to something else that doesn't
1042640	1044960	have to do with video game news.
1044960	1046520	Really what would that be?
1046520	1047520	That would be the mailbag.
1047520	1051240	Ah but don't our emailers sometimes email us with video game related things?
1051240	1052240	I would hope so.
1052240	1053240	Sometimes but I ignore it.
1053240	1056680	Alright well let's open up the old mailbag and see what's in store.
1056680	1059320	If you want to email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1059320	1069800	Um today's first email actually comes from Grin without a cat.
1069800	1074720	Hi um hey guys I've dug up some sales figures for PS2 hardware after listening to you trying
1074720	1076800	to figure out why Sony hates Europe.
1076800	1081200	I don't think it's sales figures at the moment there's been 25 million PS2 sold in Japan
1081200	1084880	47 million in North America and 45 million sold in Europe.
1084880	1088120	The slimline model is actually sold better in Europe than anywhere else with 18 million
1088120	1091520	against North America 16 million and Japan 6 million.
1091520	1094760	Europe also seems to be the one who takes some interest in their casual and innovative
1094760	1097400	games such as Itoy, Singstar and Buzz.
1097400	1099080	A quiz game with buzzer peripherals.
1099080	1102680	They've all been big big sellers and done really well with non gamers.
1102680	1105720	And it's not like Europe is short of PS3 game developers either.
1105720	1109120	Titles coming out of Europe include Burnout Wipeout, Grand Theft Auto, Heavenly Sword
1109120	1113840	Killzone Motorstorm, Little Big Planet, Singstar and The Darkness.
1113840	1115180	It's kind of ironic in a way.
1115180	1120000	Before Sony came along it was Nintendo that screwed Europe with games being released here
1120000	1123000	years later and price is way higher than we pay now.
1123000	1126920	Some games didn't even show up at all but first two generations and it was actually
1126920	1131120	seen as something of a savior to the European market of the now it appears Microsoft has
1131120	1135400	taken that role as Nintendo is still screwing us on game releases so after all that we still
1135400	1140960	don't know why Sony hates Europe love you grin without a cat.
1140960	1146560	I don't know it seems like every week we're getting some type of email from a European
1146560	1150720	listener and understandably so don't get me wrong but a European listener who is a little
1150720	1155040	bit upset because they're constantly getting screwed by the game companies so unfortunately
1155040	1159000	I don't have an easy answer for you on that one but thank you for the insight we do appreciate
1159000	1160000	that.
1160000	1165440	I thought that I was actually very well thought out email so thank you for sending it.
1165440	1169960	Next one comes up is from Bear Who Drive Car please make Sky stop attempting accents especially
1169960	1175840	British that is all well I don't know what you're talking about Rob that your accent
1175840	1176840	really is.
1176840	1177840	Carry on.
1177840	1178840	Would you like to go out and have some tea?
1178840	1182960	It's really awful Bear Who Drive Car would you like to go out and have some tea a spot
1182960	1188240	of tea or are you going to continue to be a tit?
1188240	1196520	Next up comes from Sy this is dear olr hi grin anyhow on my world warcraft server cough
1196520	1202440	Duran cough I guess there's a guild called less qq more pew pew just thought it was funny
1202440	1205400	love this show you guys rock stuff like that.
1205400	1210200	The olr guild is on Ravencrest by the way if you want more information go to the forums
1210200	1214160	although that is a great name for a guild less qq more pew pew I should look that up
1214160	1218000	on the armory.
1218000	1224020	So how about this this one comes from Ali so I thought I would voice a few opinions
1224020	1227960	on your cynicism toward the ps3 my brother had the opportunity to play a ps3 a couple
1227960	1231320	of days ago and he told me it was really a lot of fun I believe he played resistance
1231320	1235900	fall of man in gran turismo hd now granted my brother is pretty hardcore gamer he pulled
1235900	1240720	strings to get himself an xbox 360 at launch got a ps2 at launch etc now I thought I would
1240720	1244440	remind you of the ps2 launch everyone told us we were crazy for spending that much time
1244440	1249920	that much on the game system and the dreamcast was so much better I also remember reading
1249920	1254640	that the emotion engine was nigh impossible to program for however once time passed the
1254640	1259520	ps2 gained traction price wise the price stayed even as flint inflation went on and people
1259520	1265360	cracked how to get the most out of their ee now look at the ps3 everyone says the 360
1265360	1269400	is 100 times better that the cell is near impossible to program for and that it was
1269400	1272800	too expensive I think that will happen in a year or two the ps2 will see revival and
1272800	1277720	will take the market other than that I literally got my 360 a half hour ago and I got cracked
1277720	1281320	down call of duty 3 gears of war saints row and test drive unlimited the reason I'm telling
1281320	1286080	you this is that I want some good um some music games I heard that ddr for 360 wasn't
1286080	1291040	too good and as far as I can tell guitar hero 2 is not on xbox 360 will guitar hero come
1291040	1296520	out for the xbox 360 and is ddr any good on 360 um yeah it is coming out on 360 I believe
1296520	1300460	April is the big month for guitar hero 2 I like this insert usual love the show dribble
1300460	1305560	here thank you uh boom boom rocket I don't know much about but people that have gotten
1305560	1308560	their hands on it say if you like music games you're gonna like yourself some boom boom
1308560	1312760	rocket uh there's that I don't know when that'll be out though knowing uh the release schedule
1312760	1317600	it could be summer it could be the end of the year um ddr on the 360 is actually it's
1317600	1323780	a it's not that bad it's just components of it are bad um but the game itself the main
1323780	1328320	core element of the game I mean what's ddr it's songs and steps the songs are great and
1328320	1332600	the steps are great so that's it it's it's a fine game it's just all the other stuff
1332600	1337600	around it like quest mode sucks and some of the other stuff is not so hot but uh the game
1337600	1342640	itself is fine um it depends how much do you love ddr I mean you're willing to spend 80
1342640	1346760	bucks on it that's the question but it's some good songs and they'll keep you in shape and
1346760	1357160	all that good stuff and our last email of the uh day is uh from uh azhp hey guys just
1357160	1362960	had a comment possibly a very long comment on what did I miss him oh sorry lanky style
1362960	1367800	was here and leaving and I was trying to kiss him on his bald head okay um on the email
1367800	1371480	you guys got last week on the topic of piracy affecting game development first of all I'd
1371480	1375280	like to say that the fact that nintendo puts out arguably higher quality games than sony
1375280	1379560	and microsoft is that they simply care more about the fun factor in the games than any
1379560	1385720	other developer out there uh shigeru miyamoto said in his gdc keynote that if at any point
1385720	1389240	during the development he feels they have lost sight of the fact that this game is supposed
1389240	1394960	to make people happy he scraps it and redoes it from the ground up that's devotion secondly
1394960	1398520	the reason we are seeing more and more rehash equals is not because the developers do not
1398520	1403360	have the resource to make entirely new franchises or because piracy is affecting them in an
1403360	1409160	adverse fashion it is because the higher ups at companies decide they tell their developers
1409160	1413440	make this the same game as last year and put a new title on it so you can generate large
1413440	1417980	revenues this is purely marketing and financial based decision and is probably not affected
1417980	1422520	at all by the piracy issue nintendo is not like other companies in this regard they spend
1422520	1426080	as much time as they want or need pushing it back pushing back release dates if necessary
1426080	1431720	to ensure the highest quality games not the highest quantity lastly nintendo's consoles
1431720	1436400	are not much harder to pirate are not any harder to pirate games on than the xbox uh
1436400	1440600	than the ps2 or xbox i have a mod chip in my gamecube and i burn my original discs to
1440600	1445720	many dvdrs so that i don't have to lug around giant dvd cases that gamecube games come in
1445720	1451360	as i travel a lot there are also mods that allow you to use full-size dvds for your games
1451360	1455960	so the argument that nintendo games are harder to pirate as a reason that nintendo is succeeding
1455960	1460440	is not valid i honestly don't think that any company looks at pirating as a major reason
1460440	1464120	what their games are not selling as well because most people who pirate games wouldn't buy
1464120	1468200	the games they did not have the opportunity to pirate them so the ratio of pirates to
1468200	1473040	mass consumers is really low and mostly for people with the technical know-how anyway
1473040	1476320	that's just my two cents i hope this sparks some discussion between all of you as i wanted
1476320	1480160	to show the corporate side of gaming as another reason why games are not as high quality as
1480160	1486520	they used to be hey freaking men i i would agree that piracy is something really that
1486520	1493120	not the masses really gets in on i mean um very few people would know how to put ddr
1493120	1498320	fifth mix on a psp loki uh or would know how to you know do some of that stuff you know
1498320	1502400	they would know how to pirate or mod a gamecube and all that stuff it's not an easy thing
1502400	1506220	to do your average person is not going to be able to do it i kind of think about when
1506220	1511500	piracy got really busted and got out of control and i think about napster and when did napster
1511500	1516320	really cross the line when like every media outlet started reporting on it and then every
1516320	1520640	college kid in the nation was using napster to download music off each other and to some
1520640	1524800	extent yeah the piracy still goes on today but it's not as easy as it used to be right
1524800	1528640	like remember it used to be like you just download maps napster type in metallica and
1528640	1532680	bam you get like any song you want it right yeah now you have to download limewire and
1532680	1536800	type in metallica and then and hopefully you connect to the server and you have to configure
1536800	1541040	and the thing isn't as user-friendly and you have to configure all that stuff it's not
1541040	1546820	as easy it's all about bit torrent and you use groups or new use net i'm not saying just
1546820	1551560	because it's not easy makes it right but i'm just you know that that is true that you know
1551560	1556360	you're probably never going to eliminate piracy completely but you can make it difficult enough
1556360	1562440	for that most people aren't going to figure out how to do it or care right yeah loki you're
1562440	1568360	just an exception you're a special child face it let's give him some donuts all right is
1568360	1574080	that it for the mailbag that would be it well einhänder is awesome send more email mailbag
1574080	1579960	orange laws you have einhänder on your psp yeah god damn you mailbag orange launch radio
1579960	1585160	dot com well this is something else we can get mad about because we didn't have this
1585160	1591520	this is kind of old news but because it's ending like now but australia actually had
1591520	1597440	a free xbox live gold service all weekend long that ran this weekend march 9th through
1597440	1602840	march 11th so if you're an xbox live silver subscriber in australia you got three days
1602840	1609720	worth of gold so pretty cool there and crackdown appears to be the game that a lot of folks
1609720	1614080	were going to take advantage of with their free xbox live gold accounts for the weekend
1614080	1618280	no word on who underwrote it though you know how like last time we got a free weekend wasn't
1618280	1622520	sponsored by somebody and i completely forgot who it was sponsored by so it must not have
1622520	1627280	been very effective marketing no discovery channel gave the gears of war maps it wasn't
1627280	1633320	discovery channel somebody else i don't know was it what i think it was some type of network
1633320	1638840	or tv show or something i'm sure somebody in chat room remembers who knows i'm trying
1638840	1644260	to see um maybe not history channel dark knight says history no i don't think it was a history
1644260	1655600	channel was it i don't know all righty anyways um so people love free xbox live gold weekends
1655600	1663880	people don't like bullet which and uh bullet which is really bad in fact kotaku among other
1663880	1672340	people including um was it costume get and gang game rankings.com have been ever so nice
1672340	1678320	to point out the flaws in bullet which including idiotic ai unfinished graphics and ugly textures
1678320	1684000	lighted areas too bright no lock on cheap deaths horrendous voice acting cumbersome
1684000	1688720	systems for casting spells which i might agree that is pretty bad camera angle too low to
1688720	1694800	the ground and invisible and visible barriers all over the place i don't know it just sounds
1694800	1700440	to me it's sloppy stuff well a giant brain is kind of cool you know because that's just
1700440	1704120	an enemy that you fight and the fact that it's a giant brain makes it easier to hit
1704120	1710120	with their crappy targeting system so i don't know it's okay i think is one of those games
1710120	1715680	though that probably shouldn't have been brought over here um for you know the full price maybe
1715680	1722840	well it was $49.99 so maybe $39.99 would have been a better price maybe like they have to
1722840	1729680	pay us to play it yeah maybe free would have been a better price maybe hey at least it
1729680	1734280	wasn't as bad as bomberman act zero that is one thing great they could put that on the
1734280	1738360	sticker a little sticker so you know okie from morrisons radio says hey it wasn't as
1738360	1744580	bad as bomberman act zero well i have something that should make everybody happy um in regards
1744580	1752760	to uh xbox live we have the uh classic teenage mutant ninja turtles game going to xbox live
1752760	1760940	and it's going to be um actually uh out um i believe the date was march 21st which is
1760940	1765600	right before the movie comes out on march 23rd guys isn't that speculation still because
1765600	1769640	they don't really ever know for sure what the dates are well yeah that's speculation
1769640	1774480	but i think that makes sense smart date certainly i know the game's coming out like the actual
1774480	1781680	tmnt game well um at any rate it's uh going to have two to four player co-op over xbox
1781680	1790600	live um nothing saying about enhanced modes um it's going to be uh 400 points um you know
1790600	1798000	that's uh looks like it's going to be really awesome um oh also you can still play it alone
1798000	1806560	and um it's like co-op if you want it i guess but it's still turtles dibs on leonardo dibs
1806560	1813560	on donatello for me all right well um you know i i want to address this real quick before
1813560	1817340	we get into our next segment but i noticed this coming up quite a bit in our chat i've
1817340	1820860	seen this like twice now the night and it's coming up again and the person who's posting
1820860	1824240	it has an ol army recruit number in front of them so i can't credit it but somebody
1824240	1830080	is spreading around this story about mushroom kingdom hearts coming to the nintendo we that
1830080	1835760	was a it's got to be fake right it's an april fool's joke that's what it is every year they
1835760	1840880	do an april fool's joke and it's april April fool's day so oh i see so they're the upcoming
1840880	1844440	april issue of electronic gaming monthly and they always do some stupid ass april fool's
1844440	1850120	thing all right i get it it's got to be a joke it's a joke it is a joke they even pointed
1850120	1857020	out that it's a joke yeah all right it's a nice idea but i don't i would like a new mario
1857020	1864280	rpg yeah but it's never a great idea i think that's why it makes a pretty decent joke but
1864280	1871120	uh no sorry guys not a reality yeah all right well um since jamie brought up teenage mutant
1871120	1875920	ninja turtles being confirmed for xbox live arcade and all we thought we'd take this opportunity
1875920	1880200	to play a little game here on the show that we have not played in a long long long time
1880200	1889740	so we're gonna play tonight listless here's the way listless works you guys we're gonna
1889740	1893940	come up with the definitive list around a certain topic and it's been brought to my

1983120	1992120	r-type r-type the arcade r-type why arcade r-type because it's fucking r-type all right
1992120	1999920	loki won't be your number three pick the arcade version of bionic commando wow that's kind
1999920	2003780	of obscure how is the arcade version of bionic commando different from the nes for those
2003780	2009440	that don't know hopefully not by much i don't know better graphics i could just tell you
2009440	2012720	like i haven't played bionic commando in the arcade but i can tell you that like rygar
2012720	2017400	in the arcade and on the nes were completely freaking different all right uh mikkel top
2017400	2026360	why don't you go next your number three pick i would say um the x-men game the six person
2026360	2029920	yeah yeah that was a good game we talked about that last week here on the show the x-men
2029920	2036920	game that's a very good choice all right x-men my number three pick would be quiz and dragons
2036920	2042000	so i can take on bobby blackwolf with the xbox quiz and dragons was this game and it
2042000	2045680	had like i think they used pretty much the same engine that magic sword and all those
2045680	2051000	other games magic sword god okay um like it was capcom made right and basically you would
2051000	2055680	roll dice and go around the board and you would battle monsters like slimes and whatever
2055680	2061360	and you battled them by answering trivia questions nerd it was awesome but insanely hard so quiz
2061360	2069960	and dragons my number three pick uh dark soccer my number two is planet harrier why planet
2069960	2075520	harrier planet harrier has not had a home release of any kind and it was the sequel
2075520	2080800	to um space harrier which was a really freaking awesome game and i i've played planet harrier
2080800	2086680	in the arcade it's really really fun and i think that it deserves some sort of home release
2086680	2095040	all right uh what next loki what would be your number two pick um my number two pick
2095040	2103280	would be you know actually i would like to see the name i i see the image of the game
2103280	2112960	i'm just have to go with um you know the beyonce metal slug actually because why the hell not
2112960	2119200	i mean they're gonna put metal slugging everything rather have some achievements for it all right
2119200	2124000	metal i can't believe you of all people just said i went i drew more metal slug you obviously
2124000	2134320	you're drawing a blank all right uh miklata you're number two turtles in time turtles
2134320	2141400	in time the sequel all right sounds fair it was so much fun to like throw the foot soldiers
2141400	2144880	at the screen i think that's the one you do it in and like it was like you could do it
2144880	2149360	in the first one too okay i was originally this is a case where the chat room yelling
2149360	2152000	out random things can't have influence on this because i'm actually going to pick one
2152000	2157040	from chat for my number two because um i originally was gonna say rampart because that game was
2157040	2163440	pretty awesome rampart you don't ever play our key into it was like young it was it was
2163440	2168200	kind of tetrisy because you would rotate pieces to build a wall but they have it on playstation
2168200	2172220	three i don't see why they can't have it so i'll take it off since it's on i'm gonna say
2172220	2178340	i love this idea nba jam totally needs to be on xbox live they have the codes though
2178340	2182960	for the um mortal kombat character and that game was so that could totally work too because
2182960	2189280	uh midway puts a bunch of stuff on my i want nba jam fuck yeah i'm putting nba jam down
2189280	2196760	thank you act up number one pick dark sakura radiant silver gun oh good pick radiant silver
2196760	2202760	gun because because it's freaking treasure it's treasure and by the way i do agree with
2202760	2210200	gs68 for blazing star but um but no it's got to be it's got to be radiant silver gun all
2210200	2216720	right uh loki your number one pick you know i had a couple things and i just thought of
2216720	2222760	my second uh pick but i can't remember the game's called so whatever um so my number
2222760	2228160	one pick is gonna be simpsons the arcade game oh good pick good pick my my number two instead
2228160	2232160	of metal slug should have been i and i can't remember those hentai puzzle games i kept
2232160	2238320	on the plane because those are fun the hentai kicks thing i remember what it was called
2238320	2244920	though oh you should just say gals panic that's what it was gals panic will we allow loki
2244920	2251320	to remove metal slug and put in gals panic sure all right fine we will allow metal slug
2251320	2257120	to come off the list in favor of gals panic there you go gals panic that's the first time
2257120	2260480	we've ever done that on a listless segment by the way allowed that to get changed all
2260480	2264640	right um mikotov you looked a little pissed off when loki took simpsons the arcade game
2264640	2269680	did you come up with a new number one i'm trying so hard but like that's all the arcade
2269680	2274600	games i played shall we go to the chat rooms for some ideas let me look at them would you
2274600	2278680	like me to read them to you um i'm just i can't credit all these because a lot of folks
2278680	2286080	are just yelling them out uh super super off-road moonwalker arcade uh dungeons and dragons
2286080	2295880	shadows over misteria um can i pick a ticket game no you can't do a ticket game um no there's
2295880	2303180	this crazy climber um no there's this game that everybody without getting it was by midway
2303180	2307920	and it had it had like a joystick and trackball and it was like first person shooter or third
2307920	2311760	person shooter type the grid the grid yeah you want the grid yeah i want the grid all
2311760	2315480	right the grid we just talked about that earlier in the show where were you well i was drooling
2315480	2322360	over starbucks my fault all right yeah yeah uh shane comes back in here and goes you guys
2322360	2327960	want anything from starbucks i'm like they're going back all right uh my number one pick
2327960	2334040	would be super puzzle fighter 2 turbo because that game was awesome and especially with
2334040	2338240	dance puzzle jojo and why not because they have you know street fighter 2 up why not
2338240	2345480	give us puzzle fighter 2 probably because the joystick sucks that's funny because act
2345480	2348920	deaf said that again in chat but i actually had that written down before he said that
2348920	2352760	act deaf and i are on very similar wavelengths tonight apparently so there you have it here's
2352760	2359880	the list this is stands so far before the elimination part of this list we have arcade
2359880	2369160	r-type bionic commando x-men quiz and dragons planet harrier gals panic turtles in time
2369160	2377320	nba jam radiant silver gun simpsons the grid and super puzzle fighter 2 turbo which of
2377320	2387320	these games is not worthy of being on the list dark sakura the grid oh the grid gets
2387320	2391120	denied i'm not very fond of that game miklotov says you know what i pulled that out of my
2391120	2395680	ass anyway so i'm okay with that elimination loki which of these games does not deserve
2395680	2405080	to be on the list um you know i would actually say well nba jam just because there's no way
2405080	2410040	there would be i mean it'd be nice such a cock but they can't do it blame ea they have
2410040	2414240	the rights to the nba franchise for years and years and years well actually no they
2414240	2420840	do it's the nfl not the nba right oh you're right you're right my mistake so uh next yeah
2420840	2425920	fine it'll stay um radiant silver gun because there's gonna be already like ikaru and a
2425920	2433760	bunch of other shit coming to live okay silver gun is unique it's gone no one anymore please
2433760	2440920	okay no donut for you bye bye radiant silver gun nice knowing you all right and and it's
2440920	2444280	funny because chat room was like fuck you loki fuck you and then i retract that fuck
2444280	2450320	you uh miklotov which of these comes off the list oh yeah these have these which one of
2450320	2455020	these uh does not deserve to be on the list um quiz and dragons because it's too nerdy
2455020	2460240	for that list i kind of i kind of accepted the fact that quiz and dragons would come
2460240	2467120	off the list so i'm okay with that um and i will um help jamie out and take a little
2467120	2471740	revenge on loki but um not how you think i'm gonna take off bionic commando because come
2471740	2476160	on he couldn't even tell me what was different from the nes version the nes version has better
2476160	2481040	graphics that's it no the nes version is awesome it's like what's the difference between contra
2481040	2485480	and contra in the arcade it has better graphics that's it that's the only one you need all
2485480	2489960	right uh and now there's objections going on in chat room uh black wolf has just told
2489960	2497120	miklotov to go die in a fire uh let's see anyway um all right let's look at the list how it
2497120	2504240	stands now and you guys can vote you can vote for either arcade r-type x-men planet harrier
2504240	2512360	gals panic turtles in time nba jam simpsons or super puzzle fighter 2 turbo the way this
2512360	2517260	works is you're going to send your number one and your number two pick and a private
2517260	2521740	message to sky in our chat room only if you're listening live you send your number one and
2521740	2527700	your number two pick clearly labeled that helps us break any ties so there it is um
2527700	2532780	arcade r-type x-men planet harrier gals panic turtles in time nba jam simpsons super puzzle
2532780	2536720	fighter 2 turbo what arcade games should they port next to xbox live arcade we'll have the
2536720	2540800	results later in the show it'd be awesome oh good it's a good thing you said the x-men
2540800	2545480	game because the other game i would have mentioned was the uh avengers game because the avengers
2545480	2549940	game i've been like everybody knows i've been getting back into my whole obsession with
2549940	2555160	captain america and i love the avengers so i've been like actually downloading them we
2555160	2560920	we actually uh played that the other day the old game i was gonna say uh i don't think
2560920	2566560	they would put gals panic on live arcade because it's too pornographic for them it's a fun
2566560	2571600	game though they could do girls of xbox well they have was it they don't they have the
2571600	2577600	one that's not gals panic but it's like gals panic but in 3d that it's not nudity but it's
2577600	2582360	just you know scantily clad you know it's broth and pennies exactly the brawn panty
2582360	2586760	game you should just call it that so that if you can have dead or alive extreme beach
2586760	2591680	volleyball whatever then you can have that all right that game sucks does it i i still
2591680	2598360	not played it jamie bring over dead or alive extreme so we can play it this weekend okay
2598360	2603060	actually not this weekend bad weekend i have a date in the bay area yeah sort of well i'm
2603060	2606240	going to it's not a date but i'm going to a birthday party so i was going to say saturday
2606240	2611140	you should come over for like for a barbecue at christine's birthday i have an engagement
2611140	2615680	somewhere else i'll tell you offline because you're more than invited which i told you
2615680	2619760	about the stream beach volleyball olr extreme beach volleyball i think not if you want to
2619760	2624680	see me in a speedo you need help i played volleyball in high school did you yes i did
2624680	2629600	because um i don't know why the they would always make me the server because i was short
2629600	2635360	and i couldn't spike you played volleyball in high school okay wow did it but was it
2635360	2641840	sunny enough in kansas to actually play volleyball oh it was indoor volleyball all right i played
2641840	2646640	uh marching band that's that was my sport i was a marching band too and your book something
2646640	2650080	else i played a lot of in high school that i haven't played a lot of since is earthworm
2650080	2656800	gym and guess what dave perry the shiny entertainment founder has hinted uh that a new earthworm
2656800	2662360	gym game is going to quote happen eventually apparently they have put together the pieces
2662360	2668120	of the development team uh to revive this game that originally came out in 1994 you
2668120	2671520	might remember it was the game where you could like launch cows and i remember the burping
2671520	2675960	theme so i went earthworm gym like when you like somebody burped the title and they recorded
2675960	2680120	it because that's how mature earthworm gym was of a game i think it would be kind of
2680120	2683440	fun to see that come back why do i have a feeling this might be an xbox live arcade
2683440	2689960	title i don't does it does it does it scream xbox live to anyone else is it just me yeah
2689960	2696400	it does no we'll see so um they did didn't they do like a 3d remake of it or something
2696400	2701880	like that that came out on the psp you're thinking of bubsy i think no no i'm thinking
2701880	2706920	earth was a gym yeah i don't know there was like a quasi 3d remake or something somebody
2706920	2711960	i just yeah ew 3d earthworm gym the new earthworm gym better be 2d so apparently there was one
2711960	2718240	i just never played it i guess that's a good thing anyways so um well earthworm gym you
2718240	2723920	know it's a great game the question is how do you get your girlfriend to play games with
2723920	2729440	you speaking of which you have excellent timing there is a list that's been posted on the
2729440	2734960	internet how to get your girlfriend to play video games with you you put lots of naked
2734960	2740240	people in it you put things that she likes in it and not things you like in it i don't
2740240	2744540	know number one they say find out if your girlfriend has ever played video games she
2744540	2749960	may not be a full-blown gamer but she may have played mario games when she was younger
2749960	2754120	and she may play games on the internet and stuff like that um to remind your girlfriend
2754120	2759320	that if you both play games you'll be able to spend even more quality time together bullshit
2759320	2764440	um pick out games she might like if you're not 100 sure she'll enjoy it you can rent
2764440	2770880	it uh try to choose a game or system um that isn't too confusing and doesn't require short
2770880	2776560	reaction time because because girls are feeble-minded apparently that's what i was just thinking
2776560	2781360	oh because my female brain can't figure out these buttons well the voice you're hearing
2781360	2785960	by the way is loki's wife nelly oh i'm sorry hi i'm nelly that's right and i'm retarded
2785960	2791680	because i can't figure out buttons what do i do with this i don't know where does the
2791680	2797640	thingy go uh if you can get a game that is multiplayer optimally co-op and says consider
2797640	2801440	your girlfriend's personality when picking out a game some girls may prefer brightly
2801440	2807760	colored all ages games like katamari bust a move or lego star wars sims or any mario
2807760	2811520	game but remember if your girlfriend is an individual who could just as well go for halo
2811520	2816160	resident evil or grand theft auto or nelly's case dead or alive extreme beach volleyball
2816160	2820700	too don't get games that involve things like strippers prostitutes sex unless she has a
2820700	2825520	sense of humor about the subject well i yeah it's a good thing that they added the sense
2825520	2830240	of humor thing but i was about to disagree and it says have fun when you play with her
2830240	2836600	even if you make a good time she'll enjoy it even if she's not into games and yada yada
2836600	2842240	yada and basically um i don't know so they have a whole bunch of tips out there it's
2842240	2848960	on wikihow.com get your girlfriend to play video games if you're really interested in
2848960	2854880	i just say you know like nelly said make sure that there's porn in there or something or
2854880	2861200	incentives get rez with the trans vibrator there you go all right well every week on
2861200	2865240	this program dark sakura likes to surf the internet up and down and left and right and
2865240	2869640	back and forth uh whatever she the ddr steps are that she's dancing to this week will be
2869640	2874780	the world wide web surfing to find the website of the week to share with you all here on
2874780	2879040	orange lounge radio so dark sakura what is your website of the week um you picked it
2879040	2884760	out i helped you you asked for ideas i gave you ideas but it would have been one that
2884760	2890340	i would have used um it's potterpuppetpals.com which i think was down for a while but um
2890340	2896040	and really it's just you know the ones that came out in the actual puppet version um with
2896040	2904040	the sexy snape animation and uh the muggle pants animation and stuff like that so potterpuppetpals
2904040	2914100	it's snape let's bother him um is that just potterpuppetpals.com yeah all right my favorite
2914100	2920560	part of that is every time snake comes out and like i snake the potion master i was like
2920560	2926920	yeah all right that was a very brief website of the week that's what happens when i suggest
2926920	2930680	it then dark sakura doesn't have anything to say about it really all right well if you
2930680	2936720	want to talk about something cooler than potter puppet pals uh let's talk resistance fall man
2936720	2941760	it's getting updated soon it's gonna have um some brand new multiplayer content as well
2941760	2948880	as um some episodic content new modes and maps and whatnot so that's kind of cool and
2948880	2954880	apparently on march 23rd uh coinciding with the european launch they're going to launch
2954880	2959840	the two multiplayer modes which is team conversion uh basically the conversion mode with teams
2959840	2966840	and assault and where you destroy your team's defending base and they're also adding a spectator
2966840	2973400	camera mode as well and um later on we should be getting some more story elements um in
2973400	2977160	the form of episodic content so i'm glad to see that they're actually doing some stuff
2977160	2980840	with this game because it is pretty an awesome game it's just you know once you finish with
2980840	2986020	it i guess multiplayer is the only thing left for you like go back through the game get
2986020	2991800	some more weapons but that's about it fun though all righty well we're going to open
2991800	2996000	up our skype line here very soon so you guys can interact with our program as uh we had
2996000	3001560	a couple people calling in during part a if you want to give us a call the number is 1-877

3102840	3108360	beatmania game 10th style and i just want to shout out a quick review for it oh sure
3108360	3113960	beatmania 10th style now this is an import game right yeah it's an import game so i have
3113960	3119000	to use uh swap magic all right well tell it or you have to own a japanese playstation
3119000	3126400	too like i actually own one uh it has a lot of dust on it but i have one yeah well tell
3126400	3135760	us your review uh beatmania 10th style well it has my favorite song list in it and uh
3135760	3141280	i heard a lot of complaints about it on uh just some of the various bimani communities
3141280	3149080	but i didn't really see it i mean it was what were some of the complaints i don't know like
3149080	3155760	i just heard that it was bad just people going this sucks you can't ever you can't ever take
3155760	3159760	that for an answer though you can't let somebody go this sucks you got it why why does it suck
3159760	3167760	yeah the only thing that i ever heard about it that was legitimate was that it's where
3167760	3173640	the difficulty really started ramping up there are a few songs in there where the difficulty
3173640	3180120	just starts getting a little intense but um overall i mean i think it has the best song
3180120	3186240	list out of uh the releases that i've played it does have a pretty solid song list i remember
3186240	3193240	that what uh what types of songs would bimani fans be uh happy to know or in the game well
3193240	3200760	um there was eggsy on by led light and there uh there was a lot of uh sampling masters
3200760	3204600	sampling masters was really heavy in there there was both rattle the mercury and rattle
3204600	3214280	the sun of some sampling masters is stuff 108 daddy daddy it was really it was a talk
3214280	3220320	heavy um mixed there was a lot of there's a lot of talk songs in there if i've never
3220320	3225360	played a beatmania 2dx game before in my life but i just happen to have you know a playstation
3225360	3229960	2 japanese or a swapper or whatever do you think the beatmania 2dx 10 style is a good
3229960	3236800	entry into the series for someone entry level it depends because i'm training somebody right
3236800	3241360	now and they seem to really like and be able to play a lot of them but if you've never
3241360	3247380	played before i'd say maybe this one's just a little too hard because after maybe the
3247380	3254280	first five songs the difficulty starts to ramp up a bit so maybe not ten style but ten
3254280	3258400	style would be an awesome second or third game all right well there you have it any
3258400	3266720	final thoughts for our listeners paradox vincent on uh comment on the uh getting girls to play
3266720	3275800	games segments actually um like some of the games that i found worked really good were
3275800	3286560	you know katamari and uh ddr actually but no rez rez didn't work rez doesn't work even
3286560	3295040	with the attachment huh even with the trans vibrator attachment well i don't know about
3295040	3301360	the trans vibrator attachment maybe you need to have her take a second look uh maybe all
3301360	3305360	right paradox vincent thanks so much for the call uh we appreciate it and have fun with
3305360	3312120	your beatmania 2dx 10 style oh i will all righty and uh uni uh is in chat saying uh
3312120	3321080	i play games and i'm a girl indeed you are let's go over to the chat you know i i again
3321080	3324640	there's i guess there's just a difference though i i think when we read these stories
3324640	3329320	about how do we get girls into gaming they mean the casual gaming girl i think not the
3329320	3333880	hardcore gamer nerds you know like you and i regardless of sex you know and all that
3333880	3339160	i don't know all right uh let's go back to the phone lines take another call uh hello
3339160	3345240	you're on orange launch radio who's this good evening this is dmn hi dmn god you get through
3345240	3350360	every week what's on your mind um first of all sorry for making you all listen to that
3350360	3354360	song folks who are listening to the podcast only have no idea what you're talking about
3354360	3359440	it was a bonus segment tonight so there you have it it'll be on stfu a nice plug appreciate
3359440	3364200	that thursday night seven o'clock right well i was gonna plug it later on but first things
3364200	3370920	first review of ssx blur um the game's amazing i highly recommend it if you want to we um
3370920	3376560	it feels a lot like it feels a lot like ssx 3 and ssx tricky um not as not so much as
3376560	3383300	on tour which i really didn't like um it's 50 definitely recommend it what if i've never
3383300	3390160	played ssx before in my life what do i have to look forward to um if this is your first
3390160	3396440	ssx game you may be a little diff it may be a little difficult for you um the the thing
3396440	3403080	that's really difficult is uh excuse me the thing that's really difficult in that game
3403080	3406680	is moving around and doing tricks um because they do it a lot differently than you would
3406680	3413360	with a dualshock 2 controller um once once you get accustomed to that though um as the
3413360	3418340	tutorial does a great job of get having you get the hang of it it's a lot of fun when
3418340	3427560	will ssx tricky come out an ssx blur when people don't give a shit about ao ratings
3427560	3431640	all right fair enough anything else that you've played this week you want to share with our

3556560	3562760	call here hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's legend azaku hi legend azaku
3562760	3570000	what's on your mind buddy um just just ranting on the internets in particular how people
3570000	3577080	are just bitching and moaning about you know how how the ps1 ps3 game unreal 2003 is actually
3577080	3581280	getting keyboard and mouse support i would like to see that as an itune review by the
3581280	3588880	way as an itunes review of this program that's just ranting on the internets yeah yeah sorry
3588880	3594320	go ahead as you know they're saying that it's going to give you know pc gamers who basically
3594320	3599240	grew up on keyboard mouse myself uh it's going to give them an advantage over the the folks
3599240	3605920	that use access just to play the game and there's just uh some back and forth arguing
3605920	3609920	well what do you think is it really that big a deal or should people just shut up about
3609920	3614360	it or what the only exceptions to con you know the only good controls that i've seen
3614360	3621760	so far you know in console first person shooters is golden eye and perfect dark that's it because
3621760	3626360	they had that they had the benefit of the you know the the joystick on the n64 and it
3626360	3635020	actually felt nice on your hands whereas you know stuff like halo honestly you know personally
3635020	3640360	i found it really hard to just you know to actually aim and i found that and i found
3640360	3644600	it very difficult with every other first person shooter that i've seen on the console it's
3644600	3649000	just it was just horrible but now that they had a keyboard and mouse i could pretty much
3649000	3655200	it's easier for me to transition this is you know but then on the other side you could
3655200	3661600	actually use six axis you know you know to aim to move the to move the aim you know to
3661600	3666480	move you know to basically aim up and down and then you can just use the t-pad to move
3666480	3670520	to move forward backwards side to side since you since you brought up halo you know there
3670520	3675720	are current existing 360 games that will use any usb keyboard final fantasy 11 is what
3675720	3680800	i'm thinking of right but the halo 3 ought to accept a mouse and a keyboard usb mouse
3680800	3685640	and usb keyboard as possible control devices just to throw the piece of gamers a bone at
3685640	3691000	least because you know they're still out there and that that would pretty much on getting
3691000	3696160	halo 3 if it had that i could just hook up a you know mouse and keyboard and then i could
3696160	3700960	just you know play at my in my own comfort zone without having to go through hell trying
3700960	3705440	to learn the controls and trying to be good at it hmm interesting all right well any other
3705440	3712840	thoughts for our listeners tonight um um tune pawns initial d that's all i have to say all
3712840	3721080	right what's that what maximum two oh i thought you said you want to comment on initial d
3721080	3726880	no i said maximum tune is greater than initial d that's all i certainly when it comes to
3726880	3730880	the soundtrack i would agree oh yeah that too and the fact that it's more real than
3730880	3737200	than initial d all right well uh racing game fans if you uh disagree with zaku uh call
3737200	3742000	them at home but i can't give you the number all right thanks zaku for your call as always
3742000	3746920	take care buddy bye bye all right let's go to the next call hi you're on orange launch
3746920	3752680	radio who's this it's ron the official spoken at a chat room what's up everyone hello rama
3752680	3758880	how are you doing my friend i'm doing good how is everybody else over there uh i'm okay
3758880	3762120	the other two are kind of quiet tonight they don't want to participate in phone calls tonight
3762120	3766360	i don't know what's going on fine just have you know a lot in my head they're having chat
3766360	3772600	room online actually no i'm trying to take calls here no but then do you want dark soccer
3772600	3777240	you you talk to rama hi i have to go pee anyway you talk to rama oh that's really fucking
3777240	3790240	good radio rob way to go yeah he's just yeah way to go rob go to bathroom hi what a wuss
3790240	3801200	hello hi hey what's on your mind i got a question what i got a question for you i read an article
3801200	3806640	on consumers sometime back about people complaining about game stop the fact that they open up
3806640	3810400	all the video games and put it out on display and then when they sell them they sell them
3810400	3815600	at the full price they'd rather not knock a couple bucks off um what do you think about
3815600	3819440	that well first of all i have no affiliation with game shop whatsoever anymore
3819440	3827920	that's fine but honestly they don't do that with all of their games that's like the last
3827920	3834120	one and it hasn't been played the disc has not been physically touched on the thing it
3834120	3840280	has not been inside of the system it is an unused game it is only that the case has been
3840280	3846800	opened correct you're right on that but i guess from my point of view from working retail
3846800	3853320	it seems like it belongs in box status where you won't still new it's open and technically
3853320	3856880	you really can't say it's new so you're not a couple of dollars off it's sort of like
3856880	3861560	a shade of gray when you think about it i think open box really should apply to uh like
3861560	3868600	hardware like appliances the same thing thinking with demos and shoes as well but i remember
3868600	3872920	i was with a friend of mine you know my friend patty we were looking for a game we found
3872920	3878200	it but they would not get a couple bucks or because it was open it was like a display
3878200	3881760	box you know they took the game out and all of that and the boxes are a little bit faded
3881760	3887540	i mean at least they could at least get stumped well i think that um well okay look at it
3887540	3890820	this way um if ever you go to the bookstore and you have books that are shrink wrapped
3890820	3894560	you know but you have books that are unwrapped they're still going to sell you the book at
3894560	3900480	the same at the same price unless the book itself is damaged if the game is not damaged
3900480	3906920	If the case is not damaged, then there's no reason for them to make any differentiation
3906920	3907920	between it.
3907920	3913480	You're right, but it's just that some people argue about that.
3913480	3917880	I mean, that's one of the reasons I try not to shop at GameStop unless I really have to,
3917880	3918880	you know?
3918880	3924880	Well, I don't shop at GameStop anymore at all, so don't blame me there.
3924880	3926880	Go to GameCrazy.
3926880	3930640	There's no GameCrazies out here in New York, not that I know of.
3930640	3934960	They should be attached to a Hollywood video, if you got them.
3934960	3937480	We have a Hollywood video, but there is no GameCrazies there.
3937480	3938480	That's sad.
3938480	3942480	Around here in New York City, you have the local shop, Best Buy, Cirque du Sole, if you
3942480	3944040	like me, there's a GameCrazy store.
3944040	3947280	Well, GameCrazy sells old games, and that's why I love them.
3947280	3949160	Not just because Dan Mina works there.
3949160	3952240	Well, it works for me, definitely.
3952240	3954880	All right, well, it sounds...
3954880	3957120	Is there anything else, Rama?
3957120	3958720	I want to call you out, Skye.
3958720	3961400	I'm tired of you talking trash about Vista.
3961400	3962400	I don't...
3962400	3963400	I'm tired of it.
3963400	3965760	I'm not really talking a lot of trash about Vista.
3965760	3967880	I'm just not that interested in it.
3967880	3971720	Yeah, but the thing is, there's no Windows XP.
3971720	3975480	Every popular XP coming out, oh, new upgrades, brand new hardware.
3975480	3979720	By the time the new OS came out, it's definitely time to upgrade, because it's been like maybe
3979720	3981840	two or three years since the last upgrade.
3981840	3987080	Since it was Vista, it's been a while since, you know, the last operating system was with
3987080	3988080	XP.
3988080	3992400	We got newer hardware for Vista to support, and people complain about bugs left and right.
3992400	3997880	A lot of those bugs do not even apply unless you're like a hardcore, higher-end user doing
3997880	4000160	stuff you shouldn't even be doing.
4000160	4002160	Why should I upgrade to Vista?
4002160	4007920	Well, personally, because if there are newer hardware that's coming out that XP may not
4007920	4014320	be able to support, and the fact that XP and Vista is more secure, is more stable, I've
4014320	4015320	been...
4015320	4016800	But that's Microsoft being a cunt about it.
4016800	4022400	I mean, seriously, because the new hardware doesn't have to lock out XP.
4022400	4029560	So besides the fact that, you know, I'm not going to have much choice to upgrade to Vista,
4029560	4032320	why do I need to upgrade to Vista now?
4032320	4038440	Well, to be perfectly honest, I can't say now, because if that was the case, I'd worry
4038440	4039440	I'd update it.
4039440	4041120	Drew and I, he's already updated.
4041120	4046000	I'm waiting a month before I get all my hardware upgrade ready to go, because I want to really
4046000	4050840	try out this copy that's out in stores, because I shouldn't be really famous, but I was a
4050840	4055280	beta tester, and I've been playing around with it since it was Lobo, and I've seen the
4055280	4059280	changes from like 2004 all the way up to now.
4059280	4061520	Ram, I've got to be honest, you're not selling it to me.
4061520	4066240	I mean, you're telling me that because everyone else is doing it, I should do it?
4066240	4067840	I'm doing the best that I can.
4067840	4069080	I work retail, you know?
4069080	4070080	I know, you don't work retail.
4070080	4071080	I'm going to be perfectly honest.
4071080	4076200	Look, let me tell you straight up, honestly, if you don't want to upgrade to Vista, that's
4076200	4077200	fine.
4077200	4078560	I mean, to each his own.
4078560	4081440	Me personally, I plan on doing the upgrade in due time.
4081440	4084280	XP is still going to be around for a couple of years.
4084280	4088240	The only time Microsoft is really going to force everyone to upgrade to Vista is when
4088240	4090800	they say, oh, we're no longer supporting Windows XP.
4090800	4091800	All right.
4091800	4094160	I'm going to read some chat comments on this and then wrap up here.
4094160	4098040	I see James Patrick says, you can control audio for every separate program in Vista.
4098040	4100920	I'm trying to help you out there with some good reasons.
4100920	4101920	Let's see.
4101920	4102920	What was it?
4102920	4105520	Somebody has said they are on Windows.
4105520	4108760	Oh, NM64 says, Vista, heck, I still prefer Windows 2000.
4108760	4109760	There you go.
4109760	4110760	All right.
4110760	4114560	Well, Ram, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.
4114560	4116480	Any last words for our listeners?
4116480	4119760	Listen to uni's radio or shout cat.
4119760	4122600	I don't remember the name of it, but she should be posting in the chat room.
4122600	4123600	All right.
4123600	4125000	I'm sure she appreciates the plug.
4125000	4126000	Take care.
4126000	4127000	No problem.
4127000	4128000	Bye.
4128000	4129000	But don't listen to it right now, because we're on the air.
4129000	4130000	All right.
4130000	4131000	Take care.
4131000	4132000	All right.
4132000	4137840	Thanks so much for the call, and we're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line now.
4137840	4140960	Thank you so much to those of you that got through tonight and participated in the show.
4140960	4142520	We appreciate it as always.
4142520	4148280	I'm going to go around and ask if there's any last minute stories, dark soccer, anything?
4148280	4155480	Not particularly, just I'd like to remind everybody that I'm really awesome, and okay.
4155480	4156480	That's not a story.
4156480	4157680	Loki.
4157680	4162360	There was a thing that's coming out in Japan that's actually kind of funny.
4162360	4168160	It's a painting program for the DS, and you basically paint like those paint by number
4168160	4174000	things, but for the DS, so it's like a coloring book.
4174000	4176320	Sounds kind of interesting.
4176320	4177320	Not really.
4177320	4178320	Yeah.
4178320	4179320	Not really.
4179320	4184120	I got to send an interesting last minute story here.
4184120	4188280	This was sent to me via email by Brad from PodCulture.net.
4188280	4190600	Let's see.
4190600	4198840	A Japanese man has blamed his six axis for a new impotence problem.
4198840	4204600	Mr. Aoi Bailey says he cannot get an erection anymore.
4204600	4208880	He says having his controller in his lap in close proximity to his penis has left him
4208880	4210280	unable to perform.
4210280	4214000	He thinks the controller is sending out a Bluetooth frequency that can cause bodily
4214000	4215000	harm.
4215000	4218720	He has contacted Sony to find out if he's not the only one having problem from the PlayStation
4218720	4220720	3 controller, but has yet to get a response.
4220720	4223920	Bailey plans on going to the doctor this week to try to get some answers.
4223920	4229960	So Bluetooth gives you impotence apparently.
4229960	4231840	What the hell is this?
4231840	4236360	I think he just has emotional problems, and that's why he's impotent.
4236360	4238520	Why is he trying to play the game with his penis anyway?
4238520	4241680	It sounds like he's trying to put the controller right there to maybe look at a picture of
4241680	4242680	a pretty girl.
4242680	4245800	I don't know about you, but when I play the game, I don't have my hand down there.
4245800	4248560	I have the controller in my hands.
4248560	4250520	That's the Al Bundy way of playing video games.
4250520	4253560	One hand down your pants, there you go.
4253560	4258400	That's awfully lazy, and to be honest, I don't see that.
4258400	4260060	That's stupid.
4260060	4262160	How old is this guy?
4262160	4263160	It didn't say.
4263160	4265640	Yeah, that's what I thought.
4265640	4268640	I'm betting it's not anything that has to do with...
4268640	4270000	Well, here's what it is.
4270000	4274840	It's because the fucking imagery from the PlayStation 3 is so fucking sexy, his wife
4274840	4277800	just doesn't do it for him anymore.
4277800	4282500	Nintendo Maniac 64 wants to know, why would you put the six axis on your dick?
4282500	4283720	There's no rumble.
4283720	4288520	I guess that's a good question to ask.
4288520	4291640	One of the OL Army recruits, meaning they haven't changed their nickname yet, says,
4291640	4294800	that's how the power glove was invented.
4294800	4296200	Now you're playing with power.
4296200	4298200	That's so bad.
4298200	4303980	All right, well, let's go around, if there's no more last minute stories, and get everybody's
4303980	4304980	final thought.
4304980	4306680	We'll start with you tonight, Dark Sakura.
4306680	4308640	What's your final thought?
4308640	4310840	Give me money.
4310840	4313040	My final thought is Guinness.
4313040	4316800	That's my final thought, because I've had like three glasses of it this week.
4316800	4317800	It's good stuff.
4317800	4319920	Loki, your final thought, please.
4319920	4327080	My final thought is, it's a lot harder to put PlayStation 1 games on your PSP.
4327080	4328720	Were you successful in your attempts?
4328720	4333800	I put it on there, but the thing is, you need to have a bunch of different files from Hot
4333800	4339960	Shots 2, actually from the PlayStation Store, and then, because with each firmware update,
4339960	4345880	they change the encoding on the PS1 games, so say, for example, you find a game you like
4345880	4350280	online that someone's already converted over, it will only work for one type of the custom
4350280	4355600	firmware, which I don't have that type, so it's a pain in the ass.
4355600	4356600	All right.
4356600	4360240	Well, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
4360240	4361240	You guys are awesome.

4370600	4372140	We slowly take over the world.
4372140	4373140	That's how it works.
4373140	4376800	That's how we get our name out there, because we don't have any big corporate magazine or
4376800	4379760	game company or website that backs us.
4379760	4381920	We're just us, free gamers like you guys.

4390000	4391080	Are you here next week?
4391080	4392440	I don't know.
4392440	4393600	There's some week you had off.
4393600	4398320	I don't remember if it was this week or next, but hopefully, we will all be here next week,
4398320	4401560	but if not, then some of us will see you here next week on Orange Lounge Radio.
