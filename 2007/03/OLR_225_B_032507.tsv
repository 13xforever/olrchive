487	1368	Orange Lounge Radio
15436	19140	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19560	23805	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on March 25th, 2007.
23905	25667	We tape Orange Lounge Radio in two parts.
26107	31653	If this is your very first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio to listen to us, please check our RSS feed for past shows.
31693	36097	And you can hear part A of this episode where we talked about the launch of the PlayStation 3.
36758	37859	We talked about the black Xbox 360.
38956	39476	and so on and so on.
39496	41697	When I say launch of the PlayStation 3, I mean in Europe, of course.
42097	42457	Not here.
42497	46298	That would be old news, and we try to avoid old news, if possible, on this program.
46738	58201	DarkSakura is not here tonight, and I was out of town for the past four days, so Loki's taking over the news tonight, and I am simply commenting here with Rice Princess, who's filled in tonight and is making the occasional comment while playing on the laptop.
59441	59701	All right.
60402	61223	Loki, take it away.
61643	65507	Alright, well this week we had some more news that wasn't really favorable for Sony.
65947	70752	And it was more exclusives leaving Sony and going to the Xbox 360.
70832	74675	Not necessarily being exclusive for the 360, but for now for both systems.
75336	82282	So, for example, the first title, and actually a big one, Devil May Cry 4, has been confirmed to be on the Xbox 360 and the PSP...
86657	112823	and that is confirmed according to Capcom Japan so um that sucks and according to Xbox product manager of Microsoft Germany Boris Schneider Schneider John I guess hyphen in the name Devil May Cry is only the first there will be three exclusives total that are coming to the Xbox 360 and um
115646	121907	According to that, I believe it was Final Fantasy XIII and Metal Gear Solid 4, the other two.
122427	124648	Boy, that would be a 1, 2, 3 knockout.
124728	138250	I mean, honestly, Final Fantasy XIII for me is kind of one of the few things that Sony seems to be hanging on with right now because Xbox 360 kind of lacks really solid role-playing, next-gen role-playing games right now.
138270	141111	I mean, sure, you've got Enchanted Arm, but that is...
141587	147973	While it wasn't a bad game, it wasn't a OMG, memorable, wonderful, forever title.
148294	152278	And although Final Fantasy XIII may indeed suck, it is a Final Fantasy game.
152298	153439	There's going to be people lined up for it.
153459	157943	To be fair, though, this was in his blog post, because I guess that's the way he keeps blogs nowadays.
159204	160966	Oh, sorry, chat room says Blue Dragon.
161086	162348	Yeah, true, true, you got me there.
163088	165651	And to be honest, though, these are just...
166269	168510	Kind of a personal shopping list.
168590	170490	It's not necessarily anything confirmed.
170550	171650	This is just a rumor for now.
172011	176832	But Devil May Cry 4 is definitely... That's going to hurt.
177452	184954	And to be honest, though, you kind of have to be stupid unless there's a lot of money on the table to release something just on PlayStation 3.
185674	187955	I mean, especially if you're looking to sell lots of copies of it.
188135	189655	There's just not that many units out there.
190676	192456	For now, but we don't know what Sony might have in the pipeline.
192476	193516	And there's companies that are doing that.
193556	194097	I mean, look at...
196443	197504	Ubisoft, for example.
198625	202567	How long has Rainbow Six Vegas for the PlayStation 3 been delayed?
202988	204409	A long time.
204429	214455	It originally was supposed to be coming out at launch, and then it was delayed to January, then February, then March, now I think April and possibly May.
214816	215116	I mean...
216178	223444	That's, yeah, they're really pushing along until there's enough units out there, and it will keep moving until Christmas if it has to.
223644	225005	Can I be honest for a minute, though?
225725	234412	You know how sometimes folks assume, because we do this podcast in our spare time and everything, that we play every single game that's out there and stuff, but that's not true.
234452	235413	We don't have time to play everything.
235433	235993	I'm going to be honest.
236294	238555	Devil May Cry is one of those series I never have played.
238976	243279	As much as I would like it, it looks fun, it looks interesting, I just have never really sat down and played it.
243655	246616	So to me, this news just kind of made me go, meh, that sucks for Sony.
246976	249498	But, you know, I didn't, that was pretty much all I said.
249578	257941	I wasn't really like, oh my god, you know, this whole thing, because I'm not like super into Devil May Cry, because again, I've just never, it's one of those series I just haven't had a chance to get into.
258081	260542	If they lose Final Fantasy XIII, that's going to be hard.
260602	268806	Now, for me, that's a big deal, because Metal Gear Solid, I am not that into that series as I am Final Fantasy.
268866	272868	If Final Fantasy XIII has lost to the Xbox 360, I have zero reason to get a PlayStation 3.
273826	274186	Honestly.
274947	285411	My thinking, though, in this, and this is just kind of going back to what they did with the Final Fantasy VII series, is that they're going to release a version on PlayStation 3, and they're going to release a different version on the Xbox 360.
285451	290313	Then they're going to have something else on the PSP, and then they're going to have something else on the DS.
291193	297576	You know, the kind of, do these ten title releases for one game type thing, you know, like they did with Final Fantasy VII.
298336	300017	How uber ridiculous that was.
300217	302238	So, I don't know.
303067	304848	And the game could suck.
305189	305569	I don't know.
326208	344010	Okay, I guess I'd give that, although, well, Sony does have, again, the track record, that's kind of what I'm looking at right now, when PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and maybe that's not a fair comparison, but you kind of think that, okay, well, if it was that way before, but I get what you're saying, you know, they didn't have Mistwalker last time, and that's a pretty big something something, I'll give you that.
344554	345994	Give me a break for forgetting Blue Dragon.
346014	347035	I've been out of town the past four days.
347255	349435	I'm going to keep using that as my excuse as much as I can.
350336	353777	James Patrick says, also, Final Fantasy XIII uses the white engine.
354137	357198	Unreal Engine 3 is being used for something they haven't announced.
358118	360239	But I would bet it's a spinoff.
360559	361439	And there is something else.
361839	366601	They are going to be announcing something new during that May Final Fantasy party or whatever.
367261	367661	Interesting.
368441	370662	Jumpman says, maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 for Unreal.
371042	371342	I don't know.
372091	374273	or how about a new series out of Squeenix?
374313	376596	I mean, it wouldn't kill them to come up with a new series, would it?
377316	377617	True.
378137	382502	However, though, fear not, Sony, because not all is lost.
382582	394294	In fact, you may remember, I don't know, a while ago, there was a partnership between Namco Bandai and Sony called Celis or Celius, I guess.
395015	424158	and it's a brand new partnership that they are creating some brand new games including three games that have been announced so far and actually they showed up in Famitsu Magazine Brave Arms which appears to be like a third person action game kind of like Ninja Gaiden there was another game called Chain Limit which is kind of a James Bond or Jack Bauer style spy adventure game and Second Season 1 which is a first person drama sci-fi action title
424728	429811	And I gotta say, from looking at the screenshots of it in Fumitsu Magazine, those look damn good.
430471	432232	So, way to go.
432352	434133	I mean, that's some good stuff right there.
434453	438375	You know, they just need to have some more exclusive titles to them that look really nice.
438896	441537	And, you know, people will be all over that stuff.
441597	443378	I mean, they look really nice.
443618	444859	I can't wait for these games to come out.
447140	450622	Anyways, so kind of moving along here.
451536	452877	Night, Night, Night, Night
473106	479148	In other words, it's coming out, and if you think so at this point that it's not, you're an idiot, or you're the biggest conspiracy theorist in the world.
479288	480368	It is coming out.
480488	480788	Period.
481708	487010	One person, though, that's not really interested in the New Knights game is Yuji Naka.
487390	500153	He's basically saying that at the present, I have no such intentions to create another game in the franchise, so much like Katamari, it will probably live on without him.
502332	506274	Duke Nukem Forever Duke Nukem Forever
531311	532751	and hopefully we'll be out soon.
533712	537573	Other info... Wasn't there some type of promise it was going to be out before the end of the year?
537593	539933	Was it last year?
539993	540974	I don't know.
541314	541894	Ah, fuck it.
542014	543274	I don't even listen to them anymore.
544355	545615	Some other interesting stuff, though.
545655	552417	It's rumored that the composer for Elder Scrolls Oblivion has jumped on board to score Duke Nukem Forever.
552797	554337	And a couple of things hinting to that.
554577	560699	3D Realms developer Raphael Van Lietrop, it looks like, discussed in his blog about a recent visit
561158	564860	from Julian Soul, the guy who did the score.
565301	571184	Also, in Insider's only interview at IGN, Jeremy left one hint about his secretive upcoming project.
571624	572585	He said, when it's done.
573245	575887	So, that was another quote that they had for Duke Nukem.
575907	584512	We should get him on the show, because we had some guy from that site where they sell his music previously on the program, and we were going to try and get an interview with that guy.
584892	586453	Maybe we can try and beat him down for the details.
586713	589015	But he's an excellent composer.
589075	590836	Oblivion had some incredible music.
591229	618643	And as did, you know, Prey, he did the music for that as well And Prey had some pretty awesome songs in it But also Guild Wars has a really great soundtrack If you've ever listened to it And he did that as well So that's pretty exciting if he's doing Duke Nukem Forever But that's a very, I mean, you know, Oblivion and Guild Wars are very, you know, medieval type You know, have a certain sound to them I would see, obviously, Duke Nukem Forever's score sounding a little more like the Prey But, I don't know, it could be interesting Could be interesting He's a talented guy
619249	624433	Well, since we're talking about stuff coming out, might as well start talking about what's coming out this week.
625074	628436	And I'm going to start off here real quick with what's coming out in the UK.
629077	634621	And you had lots of stuff this week, of course, with the PlayStation, well, last week with the PlayStation 3 launch and whatnot.
635442	647432	But now, though, we've got some good stuff coming out for you, including we've got this week Gran Turismo 4 Mobile, although I would believe that when I see it, because I haven't heard anything about that.
647672	648993	I'm not sure if I'll believe that, but
649685	652246	God of War 2 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.
653746	656326	Fear is coming out on PlayStation 3 for you guys.
657147	659127	And I know that game has been delayed forever over here.
659367	659767	Oh, I'm sorry.
659787	660527	You're doing the Euro dates.
660567	660907	Never mind.
660927	663268	I was like, didn't God of War 2 already come out over here?
664288	664748	Yes, it did.
664868	666168	Just kidding.
666429	669149	300 March of Glory is finally making its way out to the PSP.
670329	672570	After Burner Black Falcon is also coming out.
674127	677288	Bionicle Heroes for the Wii being put out by Eidos as well.
677788	680488	Call of Duty Roads to Victory for the PSP.
681268	684669	Command & Conquer 3 Tiberian Wars for the PC.
685769	689150	And Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 coming out for the Wii.
689630	691110	So that's a pretty cool lineup.
691230	693990	Also, I guess, looks like a Heat Seeker on the Wii and the PSP.
694310	695931	Hopefully that stuff comes out here pretty soon.
696771	701212	And Medal of Honor Vanguard on the Wii and PlayStation 2 will be out this week.
701732	703572	As well as Test Drive Unlimited.
704310	708571	and looks like Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent as well on the PlayStation 3.
710052	712972	For the U.S., we've got some good stuff coming out.
713152	715853	Of course, this week, not a whole lot.
716033	719634	I've got a few movie tie-ins, like, for example, Meet the Robinsons.
719694	721095	Got some games coming out for that.
721415	727036	PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, the Game Boy Advance, and PSP.
727676	730237	So, you know, lots of systems for that game.
731257	732818	And, of course, on...
734366	738448	PlayStation 2 and the Wii, we have Medal of Honor Vanguard, which is going to be coming out.
739728	744370	Metal Slug Anthology is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, hopefully this week, because it's been delayed a lot.
746631	747391	Let's see here.
749112	751953	On the PlayStation 3, we have Splinter Cell Double Agent.
753231	753812	The Shivering Isles
774008	776890	I need to spend the hundred hours to just explore every nook and cranny.
777230	781853	If you happen to be in the mood for some really weird PC titles, I've got a couple titles.
781973	783754	I think these have to be my favorites for the week.
784755	787396	Super Granny 3 on the PC.
787897	789698	Rad, what do you do in Super Granny 3?
790358	794440	I'm not sure, but it looks pretty awesome.
794501	796422	Apparently... Gilf 3.
798085	823421	Super Granny 3 but that's still not my favorite title my favorite title has to be this Alien Disco Safari that one is that has to be my favorite title of the week and that's going to be coming out no idea but maybe we'll see Super Granny 4 meets the Alien Disco Safari Granny's Alien Disco Safari 4 winner Cabela's Alien Disco Safari
824344	824624	All right.
824825	828309	Well, I haven't been good for much this week, but at least maybe I can get out some Japanese release dates.
828329	828870	Would that be okay?
829090	829651	That'd be okay.
829711	830992	Do you have any exclusives, by the way?
831032	832454	I didn't hear any of the good stuff.
832967	834467	You didn't really have too much to announce.
835087	836568	Of course, you know, not a big surprise.
836628	838548	I think this has been announced originally.
838588	841469	They said they were doing Guitar Hero 80s edition or something.
841489	842589	Yeah, that was no surprise.
842609	843189	That's coming out in June.
843209	844189	You landed a date.
844330	845670	But, you know, it was weird.
845730	850451	We got linked from, like, some, like, punk rock music news site linked that.
850491	854852	Like, you know, a lot of folks kind of forgot that they've already said they're doing an 80s edition or they've hinted at it.
855152	858593	So a lot of folks are kind of taking that as, you know, news for the first time.
859153	860093	Yeah, I mean, it's this.
860472	861472	This stuff is nothing new.
861492	866093	I mean, I just thought I'd point it out because everyone's, you know, got a big boner over Guitar Hero.
866593	871314	You know, especially with the new game coming out next week, you know, so that's going to be big.
871414	872494	So, I don't know.
872654	873875	Look forward to more Guitar Hero.
873895	877455	They're definitely keeping up with their promise with releasing multiple releases throughout the week.
877795	881296	They're not the only franchise that's promised to do that, and we'll get into that a little bit later.
883256	884016	Japanese release dates.
884056	886837	Before I get into those, looking at the chat room here,
887744	888205	Let's see.
888565	890867	Meklar says, Super Granny 3, you have to save cats.
892308	893028	That could be a joke.
893069	893389	I don't know.
894350	899273	And then ShadowNextGen says, Shivering Isles is coming out the day Xbox Live is down.
899694	900094	LOL.
900975	904037	And Joshi16 follows up that with, it's only down for 14 hours.
904317	904858	It's official.
905198	907940	But don't those things usually take longer than they say they do?
907980	911523	Yeah, apparently it's not for anything specific.
911563	915506	They said they had a lot of work to do on the back end, so they're kind of doing that right now.
916257	927199	Going back in chat to the Duke Nukem Forever chat, TheRobD from This Day in Gaming says, I like how the creators of DNF, Duke Nukem Forever, actually take responsibility for screwing it up.
927500	929800	They have no excuses, just we screwed up.
931560	934221	DarkSakura made a cameo on This Day in Gaming this week, by the way.
934881	936221	Check that out, it's hilarious.
937762	938702	Japanese release dates.
939705	949552	Xbox 360 gets Absolute Blazing Infinity, Call of Duty 3, and Asia gets the release of Rayman Raving Rabbids all on the 29th of March.
950352	958598	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Mizase Surimaster is coming out from Hudson for the Nintendo Wii.
959138	962640	And this looks to be some type of sports title that's coming out.
962680	965002	It looks like it involves fishing.
965022	967203	Hasn't this been announced for the U.S.
967344	968044	as some other name?
968084	969505	Because it looks like it's all fishing.
970011	970451	is what it is.
970491	971411	Some type of fishing game.
972572	974032	I saw some screenshots for this.
974713	975053	Maybe.
975293	978014	Maybe somebody in chat room would know more information about that whole thing.
979374	979714	Let's see.
979754	982495	Also coming out on the... Well, that's it.
982835	988937	You can get some controller covers and stuff for like $5, $10 on Nintendo Wii.
989117	993479	I don't know if Raven and Raven Rabbids is coming out because that's another game that they kind of delayed.
993719	994839	It was very last minute too.
994859	997400	It was supposed to be coming out this week and then I think it got moved to May.
997660	997840	For the 360.
997880	998461	For the 360.
999061	999741	I don't know.
1001562	1008403	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Winning Post 7 Maximum 2007 on the 29th of March for the PlayStation 3.
1008463	1010324	That's a horsey racing game.
1011024	1013284	Enjoy your horsey racing if you are into that.
1014565	1019365	Coming out over on the PlayStation 2, Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix.
1019445	1021326	I know a lot of folks are very excited about that.
1022106	1024686	Vitamin X. I like the name of this game.
1024746	1026147	Vitamin X is coming out.
1026167	1027727	There's also a limited edition available.
1028334	1033917	I'm not sure if this is based on an anime or what, because I haven't been keeping tabs on my anime, but it's certainly got one of those covers.
1034318	1035518	Rice Princess, you know a lot about anime.
1035558	1036439	Is Vitamin X an anime?
1036479	1036999	I've never heard of it.
1037539	1037900	I think so.
1037980	1038800	Vitamin X?
1038840	1039260	I don't know.
1039320	1040701	It's got a little cover there.
1041442	1042262	It's an action game.
1042442	1043743	It's not ringing a bell for me.
1044183	1045184	Maybe somebody in chat knows.
1045844	1046705	Couldn't tell you that one there.
1047425	1051087	But also, this other one, this sounds like a very interesting game coming out in Japan.
1051748	1057491	Gouken Utopia, Manabi Straight, Kira Kira Happy Festa is coming out.
1058007	1061929	and this is an adventure game with a bunch of girly anime characters on the cover.
1062269	1063809	Looks like a chibi punch and kick game.
1064670	1065350	But it has a cute name.
1066170	1066430	Yay.
1066790	1067851	So have fun with that.
1068631	1070572	Let's see if anything else is coming out of the other systems.
1070672	1071592	Oh, Nintendo DS.
1071872	1072433	Digimon.
1072493	1074353	Two Digimon games coming out from Bandai.
1074693	1076014	Moonlight and Sunburst.
1076994	1080656	It doesn't really say what Vitamin X is, but it says it's a love adventure game by D3.
1080676	1082496	Oh, a love adventure game, huh?
1082516	1084197	Does that mean it's like a dating sim?
1084217	1084877	I don't know.
1085658	1085878	Maybe.
1086018	1086498	We'll see.
1087045	1089146	That's pretty much all I got for you guys over in Japan.
1089706	1092608	Have fun with your chibi girly fighting game.
1092928	1098771	Well, the US is going to see something else coming soon to your local video store, I guess.
1100492	1115099	Blu-ray or a Blu-ray release of the classic video game and arcade classic, Dragon's Lair will be coming out soon and not really a big surprise because it's been out on DVD for a while now and they expect that
1115740	1119382	It's going to be on HD DVD at some point, and it's going to be sold for $49.95.
1119782	1122903	Yikes, that's quite expensive.
1123383	1125984	I don't know how you could really, well, I don't know.
1126564	1130106	I thought the graphics were probably as good as you can get on Dragon's Lair.
1130126	1132887	I mean, you can't really re-enhance it anymore.
1132987	1134528	It seems a little bit pointless to me.
1134828	1144692	I mean, you know, Dragon's Lair has kind of already been done, you know, on DVD, and that's about as, I mean, the original was on Laserdisc.
1145601	1147342	and it wasn't that pretty.
1147402	1148382	I mean, did they clean it up?
1148422	1149402	Did they do anything to it?
1149583	1150263	Not that I can see.
1151483	1151843	Interesting.
1153044	1155385	Well, there you have it.
1155465	1158706	Is Dragon's Lair a reason to buy a $600 PlayStation 3?
1159126	1159386	No.
1160346	1161667	Yes, says Miklatov.
1162827	1163868	Miklatov's just fucking with us.
1163888	1164828	He's just kidding.
1165268	1173031	Anyways, another... Now, release Super Granny 3 on Blu-ray and we're talking or Ultimate Duck Hunter from the bonus segment tonight or whatever the fuck that game was.
1173624	1174505	Ultimate Duck Hunting
1193582	1194183	Jake Gyllenhaal
1216931	1220454	So speaking of stuff that's been delayed, Calling All Cars.
1221815	1225178	Brand new game that's supposed to be coming out to the PlayStation Network.
1225658	1227379	It's going to be one of their downloadable games.
1227499	1232864	It's been moved to April and this is done by the same guy that did God of War, David Jeff.
1234145	1240770	Basically, I don't know, he's just hit a roadblock as far as putting it out on the PlayStation Network.
1241670	1242931	Never really given any reasons why.
1243191	1245273	They did have some gameplay footage of it and it
1246148	1251969	And he said, though, I mean, he's not trying to compete with, like, a Halo or anything, or even God of War or this.
1252769	1255910	I'm still saying it looks like crap.
1256850	1258471	And he says it's all about the fun factor.
1258491	1259391	It did not look fun at all.
1259771	1260211	Oh, God.
1260271	1261071	It looked pretty boring.
1261131	1265032	So, hopefully I'm wrong, and it'll come out to be pretty fun.
1266852	1267192	I don't know.
1267492	1268093	We'll have to see.
1268533	1269533	Hopefully they release a demo.
1269973	1270153	Mm-hmm.
1270973	1273855	Another game that's getting yet another release, especially next week.
1273915	1276336	They have SingStar Pop coming out over here.
1276696	1277917	Well, that's not all.
1277957	1282779	They're going to be seeing six SingStars come out by next year.
1282899	1284760	On PlayStation 2 or mixed?
1285101	1288702	I think both because I know PlayStation 3 is getting SingStar coming out.
1288722	1293725	But wasn't PlayStation 3 only supposed to get like one SingStar and that's it?
1294365	1295886	And then they download everything with that?
1295926	1296787	Well, I think so.
1296867	1297107	I mean...
1297631	1299311	But then again, I mean, you never know.
1299832	1303553	Remember originally Karaoke Revolution was going to have add-ons to it and that never happened?
1303933	1306794	They figured out, hey, we can... We got like a couple packs here, a couple packs there.
1307154	1308814	We can sell whole games and make more money.
1309894	1313335	So, yeah, that's scary and I'm not playing any of them.
1313475	1317016	Yeah, Actdeft was asking in chat the ultimate question, will Loki buy it?
1317576	1318037	I will not touch this.
1318057	1319117	And will we put it on YouTube?
1319297	1320397	No, I will not touch this game.
1320517	1322598	Even if I get it free, I will be burning it.
1323638	1326079	Yeah, it's a horrible, horrible, horrible game.
1326099	1326319	Karaoke...
1327352	1329994	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1351713	1354734	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRater.com if you'd like to send us an email.
1355214	1359016	I just randomly picked a few emails for this week, so I apologize if I didn't get to you tonight.
1359336	1360977	You'll just have to deal with that rejection.
1361457	1366279	Let's start with an email from Meklar, who writes to say, Just a quick email to say, you rock!
1366859	1371041	And a quick little tidbit I heard from a friend who recently left the employment of Sega.
1371541	1376403	Nights is coming to the Wii, but also seems to be heading to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, too!
1378064	1390186	Seems to her, the game now plays like the magic carpet from Sonic and the Secret Rings.
1390826	1392527	Either way, it's something I've not heard before.
1392587	1393767	How about you guys and Gal?
1394987	1403268	Definitely I knew about the Wii through something similar, like a friend of a friend at Sega, but I did not hear of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1403748	1404709	Very interesting, if true.
1404769	1405549	It makes sense, though.
1405869	1406669	It does make sense.
1407556	1411218	I mean, you know, Knights is one of those franchises I think people have been wanting to see come back for a while.
1411298	1412839	So, very interesting.
1413819	1414439	I want new Rez.
1415580	1417981	Me too, but too bad it's a different company altogether.
1418341	1419142	Well, thank you for the email.
1420142	1423064	We have an email from Sakura Max.
1424404	1426645	Says, Dear OLR, first order of business.
1426765	1427946	Rob, don't be such a tit.
1428526	1429407	Stop the accent.
1429427	1430707	You disgrace my friends.
1431588	1433529	Somebody's taking issue to my British accent.
1433689	1435189	I do hear on the program sometimes.
1435229	1436410	Don't be such a tit about it.
1437523	1438043	Just teasing.
1438443	1442525	I guess part of the charm is that my accents are so horrible, I don't know what else to tell you.
1442625	1444045	Second order of business, Jamie.
1444485	1451508	The reason I say Rondo of Blood sucks is because it's on PSP, one of the consoles I don't own, and I've lost my loyalty to Sony.
1452508	1456390	I don't know, though, with some of these big games, it seems like they're trying to woo some people back to PSP.
1456430	1457390	Is it too little, too late?
1457810	1458050	Yes.
1458610	1459050	You think so?
1460131	1466393	Was there a story this week, and I don't know if it's something upcoming, forgive me, but I want to say I read something on the internet before I left for my trip that said that
1466673	1472374	Retailers are getting pissed that Sony will not do a price cut on the PSP, and some are threatening to just get the damn thing off their shelves.
1472834	1476135	Yeah, I was at the PlayStation, or Destination PlayStation show.
1476155	1481856	Apparently they were demanding that the price be lowered for the system.
1482236	1485677	I did see, though, what they were, GameStop was doing a special this week.
1485717	1490298	They had the, was it the, they had like a bundle pack a long time ago.
1490318	1495839	Remember when the PlayStation Portable first came out where it had like the case and the memory stick and stuff like that?
1496510	1497690	Well, apparently now they don't have that.
1497730	1502172	The core system is just PSP, charger, done.
1502392	1507654	So now they were offering that one at $199 because originally it was $250.
1507834	1510655	So it's kind of a markdown, but yeah.
1511255	1514176	Well, I think they're probably going to redesign it or something.
1514396	1516097	So get people to buy it again.
1516457	1516857	Bastards.
1517515	1518415	Alright, well, there you go.
1518915	1523337	Sorry, DarkSakura was not here tonight to respond to your comment, but if we remember, we'll tell her next week.
1523677	1526558	Third order of business, I just got DDR Supernova on my arcade.
1527198	1529839	Congratulations on being about six months late to that party.
1530539	1530919	Just kidding.
1531219	1537241	Fourth order of business, DDR Supernova might not be too good, considering the fact that the first one wasn't too successful.
1538081	1544763	I'm not... Yeah, I'm not sure I understand that statement, because what... What first one are we basing it off of?
1544843	1546344	Oh, do we mean like DDR Supernova...
1547245	1548506	DDR Supernova Supernova 2 Arcade
1576244	1581546	Sakura Max is the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old and signs that email and says, P.S.
1581966	1582426	Duskcap.
1584127	1584407	I don't know.
1584807	1585807	That's what he says in his email.
1585867	1588148	He says, the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old.
1588448	1590108	Do your parents know you listen to this?
1590348	1590849	Shame on you.
1591929	1597030	That closing statement right there just makes you realize why a 12-year-old shouldn't be on the internet.
1600572	1600852	Ouch.
1601792	1602152	Ouch.
1603853	1605193	Wow, you're so awesome.
1606300	1606901	N.A.I.F.
1624782	1627684	Last week you asked us to send you our favorite jokes.
1628144	1630165	Well, this is my all-time favorite joke.
1630525	1632126	Because remember last week we had the email?
1632146	1632406	Oh, yeah.
1632426	1633967	I completely forgot about it last week.
1634147	1634847	Well, here we go.
1635227	1637088	We got a joke back.
1637188	1640130	Although, we do remember we said voicemail, not email.
1640270	1640990	That's all right.
1641010	1642651	Because I don't think we got really any voicemails.
1642851	1643671	So, I don't know.
1643691	1644232	I didn't check.
1644692	1645692	Again, I've been kind of gone.
1646453	1647033	So, here we go.
1649255	1653617	I know it's an old one, but every time I tell it to my friends, they really enjoy it, and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
1653677	1659260	So Rice, Princess, and Loki and Miklatov will be our judges on how funny this joke is.
1659780	1661321	It's like American Idol for jokes.
1661401	1661982	That'd be funny.
1662042	1662562	Something like that.
1662842	1666244	Although I kind of feel like we should have some music that plays with this or something.
1668105	1671207	So maybe we should have some joke-telling music while we read the rest of this email.
1671447	1672647	I'm going to play some joke-telling music.
1672667	1672948	You ready?
1674248	1674909	Okay.
1678164	1687487	One day, the teacher walks into her classroom and announces to the class that on each Friday, she will ask a question to the class and anyone who answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday.
1688368	1692049	On the first Friday, the teacher asks, how many grains of sand are in the beach?
1692509	1694009	Needless to say, no one could answer.
1694850	1699071	The following Friday, the teacher asks the class, how many stars are in the sky?
1699491	1700852	And again, no one could answer.
1701752	1707394	Frustrated, little Johnny decides that the next Friday, he would somehow answer the question and get a three-day weekend.
1708473	1712074	So Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping pong balls and paints them black.
1712794	1715154	The next day, he brings them to school in a paper bag.
1715634	1724056	At the end of the day, just when the teacher says, here's this week's question, Johnny empties the bag to the floor, sending the ping pong balls rolling to the front of the room.
1724556	1729757	Because they are young kids who find any disruption of class amusing, the entire class starts laughing.
1730237	1733898	The teacher says, okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?
1734850	1739792	Immediately, little Johnny stands up and says, Bill Cosby, see you on Tuesday.
1741352	1743633	That's pretty funny.
1743693	1746394	I got one laugh in the room, a little chuckle from Loki.
1746414	1747474	I have bacon.
1748094	1750095	Are you laughing at the bacon or are you laughing at the joke?
1750255	1750455	Joke.
1750695	1750935	All right.
1751495	1753296	Let's go around and judge that scale on 1 to 10.
1753556	1754636	It'll be like the gong show here.
1754656	1755517	Are we going to gong the joke?
1756357	1758417	Rice Princess, on a scale of 1 to 10, how was the joke?
1760678	1761899	W. W?
1762219	1762679	Yeah.
1762699	1763179	Okay, okay.
1764123	1765804	Loki on a scale of 1 to 10, how was that joke?
1767024	1767725	It would be like a 7.
1768445	1771126	It's definitely an intelligent joke.
1771346	1773647	I haven't heard it before, so props for that.
1773827	1774628	All right.
1775348	1775588	It was good.
1775928	1777209	All right, and Mikozov?
1777229	1777209	1.
1778309	1780090	All right, why such a low score?
1780110	1784252	Because talking about Bill Cosby's balls is never a good thing, and it's not funny.
1784292	1784752	It's gross.
1784792	1785252	There you go.
1785412	1785672	All right.
1787053	1789294	Do you think this is going to encourage people to send us more jokes?
1789354	1789874	I have no idea.
1789894	1791054	10 for the bacon.
1794178	1794898	Gods and Heroes Rome Rising
1822153	1827715	A brief description of our game is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game set to Roman mythology.
1827735	1829436	Excuse me, I have the hiccups during this poor email.
1830776	1837799	Some key features is being able to play your hero character however you like with six different classes and an extensive character customization.
1838219	1843781	You also get to control up to eight minions at a time as well as have a visceral experience.
1844321	1845882	I like D&L's use of vis, where is there?
1845902	1846362	Visceral.
1846382	1846882	Visceral.
1847679	1848559	What's visceral?
1848579	1849780	I don't know, I'm probably pronouncing it wrong.
1849800	1850500	What do you mean, visceral?
1850520	1852461	Visceral, yeah, sure, visceral experience.
1853242	1853802	Visceral.
1853822	1854202	Ten!
1857284	1857744	I hate you all.
1857764	1859045	Man, that was the best joke ever.
1859105	1860425	DarkSakura, never leave me again.
1861066	1862747	With paired combat animation.
1863747	1869510	If interested, please sign up in our very active forums at community.godsandheroes.com Love and pointy things DNL.
1869750	1873912	So I like how DNL is using our mailbag to spam her game, but we'll give her that right here.
1874333	1874653	In fact...
1875669	1878590	In fact, why doesn't D&L get us an interview with peoples from the game?
1878650	1879170	We'll take them.
1879571	1889534	Now, if I can do anything and I can control up to eight minions, can I, like, sit back and, like, drink ale and have my minions, like, kill things while I just sit there and not do anything?
1889814	1892095	Do I get level, you know, experience points for that?
1893476	1893856	I guess.
1893916	1895697	I don't know.
1895817	1896497	Folks, let's see.
1896537	1900358	Blackboy in chat says, wait, Sky's reading an ad that was thinly disguised as an email.
1900458	1901239	Yeah, I guess.
1901339	1904420	But it was from a friend of ours, so I'm okay with it.
1905707	1907748	It's a game I hadn't heard about before, so there you have it.
1908768	1910729	We'll check it out and give an honest opinion either way.
1911669	1912269	So, there you have it.
1912289	1913009	That's it for the mailbag.
1913069	1915910	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to send us emails.
1916570	1928654	Well, earlier we were talking a little bit, we mentioned that the Shivering Isles was coming out for the Xbox, well, for Oblivion on PC and Xbox 360, but it was going to be downloadable on the 360.
1929874	1935056	Conveniently enough, there is some other stuff you can download off of Microsoft's Marketplace
1936720	1939863	Well, no, you cannot download porn, as Mikulatov would say.
1940463	1941504	That's not available yet.
1942005	1945287	However, they do need a porno channel on the IPTV thing.
1946228	1947429	That would sell systems.
1947809	1952453	Anyways, Jetpack, or the new Jetpack game is coming out.
1952813	1956816	If you might remember Rare's kind of little logo there.
1957697	1962981	But anyways, yeah, Jetpack Refueled will be hitting the marketplace on Wednesday.
1963782	1964762	And it will feature...
1966241	1970504	Obscenely Colorful Graphics, whatever that's supposed to mean.
1970864	1973486	It's obscene.
1973506	1976288	128 levels, multiplayer capabilities.
1976428	1977829	Multiplayer capabilities.
1978089	1978929	See, this is porn.
1979450	1986595	The original arcade version and continued exclusion of the letter K from the
1988606	1990087	And money shots, says Miklatov.
1990147	1996629	It will be available on the marketplace and will cost you 400 Microsoft points or $5 in real money.
1997830	1999430	Miklatov, you're giving this the thumbs down.
1999470	2002051	Is this one of those other games you've probably played that you're not supposed to talk about?
2002571	2003072	Does it suck?
2003532	2004212	Can you talk about it?
2006424	2007065	Why does it suck?
2007205	2009467	Because it's not fun to play.
2009487	2010288	What the hell do you do?
2010568	2015914	You shoot things and then you fly away and it's really boring and it's not Boom Boom Rocket, so why are we talking about it?
2016555	2017696	Well, the people want to know.
2017836	2019118	Well, they don't anymore.
2020139	2021720	Thank you very much, I suppose.
2022942	2027867	Anyways, this week, and Jamie will love this, but
2028729	2036613	On the Xbox Live Marketplace, they had brand new heroes and villains that you could download to expand Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2037994	2049200	And it featured eight new playable characters, including the Incredible Hulk, Magneto, Hawkeye, Sabretooth, Doctor Doom, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Venom.
2049961	2055784	And basically, you've got brand new signature power skins,
2056411	2059672	Dialogue, Conversations, and Achievement Points.
2060213	2062253	Isn't Cyclops one-eyed?
2065155	2065315	No.
2065455	2067395	Total porn on Xbox Live Marketplace.
2067435	2069736	Now they want you to download one-eyed monsters on Xbox Live.
2070677	2072598	Does he blast stuff out of his one eye?
2073538	2074318	Total porn.
2074618	2076019	He doesn't have one eye.
2076819	2078620	Doesn't Cyclops mean one eye?
2082121	2083682	One-eyed monster that shoots things.
2085734	2087195	Like a penis.
2087235	2088996	Basically, they have it divided up into two different packs.
2089016	2090717	Now, there's no need to go there, Rice Princess.
2090737	2091357	That's just dirty.
2092097	2092497	It's disgusting.
2092517	2098681	They have a hero and villain pack, each of which were 500 points, or $6.25.
2100081	2105704	Otherwise, you can also buy the combo pack, which features both, and save a little bit of money.
2106304	2106945	It's 800 Microsoft points, or $10.
2106985	2108245	So, saving a good $2.50 there.
2112485	2120550	and also they have heroes and villains gamer picks that you can download and those are each 80 Microsoft points or $1.
2120670	2124712	And chatroom, yes, I was kidding.
2124912	2126413	Of course I know who Cyclops is.
2126653	2127814	I did see the X-Men movies.
2127934	2129335	I watched the cartoon when I was a kid.
2129735	2129995	Please.
2130816	2131516	James Marsters.
2134018	2135999	Anyways, now let's talk about a game.
2136019	2137099	Why are you laughing at me?
2138961	2139701	Because you're funny.
2140217	2140917	and Visceral.
2142438	2142958	Go to hell.
2145259	2147399	Now let's talk about a game that came out a couple weeks ago.
2148239	2151760	Ghost Recon 2 Advanced Warfare 2.
2153641	2157382	Apparently, Mexico doesn't like the game too much.
2158062	2161323	I guess it has something to do with the Mexican terrorists in the game.
2161343	2162084	Fuck Mexico!
2162224	2162944	Sorry, Actdeft.
2163124	2163344	Sorry.
2164096	2173466	I think what's most interesting about this story though, because apparently the game has been blacklisted, and I want to say Chihuahua, Mexico?
2173846	2175568	Is there such a thing as a Chihuahua, Mexico?
2176593	2178074	Yes, but it has nothing to do with the dog.
2178114	2180376	I mean, there's a weed California, Loki.
2180976	2183218	Towns get names weird things all the time.
2183298	2187161	But weed makes sense, though, because weeds are just out there, and that just happens to be slang.
2187541	2188942	Chihuahua's not slang.
2189063	2189663	It's a dog.
2189903	2193966	Or Chihuahua's like, you know, they're an animal that runs around in parks like we have squirrels.
2194587	2196188	And Mexico hates it because they don't bathe.
2197216	2199359	Anyway... Wow.
2200180	2201281	The views and opinions expressed.
2201821	2212413	Actdeft says, and it's a state, like, you know, how... Well, it's not really a state, but, you know... Anyways, so Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior Fighter 2 has been blacklisted in Chihuahua, Mexico, and...
2213610	2226994	Besides the fact that the city's got a weird name, there has been apparently orders, Mexico has apparently ordered the confiscation of any and all copies of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 that surface in the state.
2228114	2230515	This is a site report from El Dario.
2233395	2234096	El Dario.
2236116	2239617	Is that also a town named after the water?
2239757	2242878	It's not El Dario, it's
2243346	2244607	I think it's El Diero.
2245007	2247248	Anyways.
2248549	2255432	A Mexican broadsheet which says that the action was taken after Mayor Hector I'm not even going to start pronouncing these names.
2255492	2262735	I would fucking buy Ghost Recon if they had El Diario as like a terrorist in it.
2262855	2269218	They've slammed the game as being a crime against the intellectual capacity of the Juarez residents.
2270059	2270119	Um
2271124	2273344	and apparently they've decided to take action.
2273504	2283386	So, in any case, GamePolitics also notes that a statement they took from the mayor who said that violent video games instill values which are upside down.
2283446	2291327	These actions are despicable because they attempt to divide the good and wool, a goodwill of the residents of America and Mexican cities.
2291748	2295908	So, you won't be able to get your fix on Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare 2.
2296228	2300009	However, God of War 2, I'm sure, is still selling like hotcakes.
2300149	2300309	So,
2302907	2303088	Actdeft
2312765	2319687	However though, if you want to get in on some of that Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare 2 action, it will be available on the PC.
2319927	2322288	They're doing the beta test, which is starting in April.
2322868	2331550	So definitely go and sign up on the website, which is ghostrecon.uk.ubi.com.
2331890	2337312	I guess this would be the UK beta test, now that I've noticed that.
2340791	2343073	Anyways, so on to a different game.
2343373	2351779	If you may not be able to play Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 and you live in Mexico, maybe you want to participate in the beta for Quake Wars.
2351839	2357442	Because id Software is looking for some good first-person shooter clans to get in on this beta test.
2357863	2363767	And basically what you'll need to do is have your clans register for this.
2364307	2369291	And basically you can participate by sending your application to etqw...
2371282	2384085	BetaTest at Activision.com and with following your clan name, number of active members, games played regularly and played competitively, your website and details like that.
2384765	2388486	100 OLR achievement points to the first person to make the El Diario clan.
2390906	2392287	But Quake Wars looks awesome.
2392347	2395868	Can't wait to play it when it comes out on the 360 PlayStation 3 and PC.
2395888	2395988	Sigh.
2398536	2402279	Anyways, kind of off to a little bit of a different tangent here.
2402819	2406862	Another first person game that's definitely popular out there right now is Gears of War.
2407583	2420572	And New Line apparently found time to register the rights for the movie, or secure the rights for the movie, so that they can make yet another horrible video game movie.
2421033	2421473	Awesome.
2422242	2435254	Anyways, Variety was reporting that New Line Cinema has snagged rights to Gears of War and that Stuart Beatty will be writing the script with Marty Bowen and Wick Godfrey.
2435435	2436015	It'll suck.
2436816	2438698	Yeah, I can't say that I recognize any of those people.
2438718	2439479	How can it be good?
2439519	2440099	I'm sorry.
2440259	2441761	It'll suck like all the other games.
2441781	2445344	So the rights went up for auction with a 21-page treatment by Beatty.
2446636	2449738	Best known for his script work on Collateral and Derailed.
2466536	2467356	God awful.
2467436	2470497	I wanted to gouge out my eyes and stuff afterwards.
2470537	2473018	Did it make you want to kill yourself like Ultimate Duck Hunt?
2473098	2473638	Yeah.
2473658	2474839	I was like, oh man.
2475139	2476099	It could be pretty good.
2476159	2486582	They could flesh out the somewhat existent story and actually make something that's entertaining and kind of interesting, which video game movies usually lack.
2487062	2489423	At least good entertaining, not like ha-ha entertaining.
2489563	2493084	Because that idea worked so well with Resident Evil and Doom.
2493384	2495785	Resident Evil is decent.
2496246	2497607	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2514772	2518714	Capcom, why you got against Torch Lounge Radio?
2518774	2520295	Afraid we're going to say something we shouldn't.
2520315	2521436	What the hell was that?
2521916	2522676	My pouty voice.
2522936	2523477	Oh my.
2524077	2525177	No love from Capcom.
2525217	2527158	No love from Capcom.
2527719	2530040	Maybe I was a little hard on Dead Rising, but anyways.
2531220	2533582	Their Capcom day is going to be April 12th.
2534782	2536223	One game has been announced already.
2536676	2549942	and that would be the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii and that's one thing that they're hoping that will be featured there as well as some info on Resident Evil 5 for the PlayStation 3 and 360.
2551002	2557745	Another thing though is they're going to be announcing a brand new game and so we don't know what exactly that is.
2558025	2559046	Just a brand new game.
2559066	2561187	Beautiful Joe again or maybe Mega Man.
2561207	2561847	That would be nice.
2563128	2565009	Miklatov is adamant about a Phoenix Wright 3.
2565549	2566009	I hope not.
2568683	2572466	That's only the best game they've ever had in, like, ten years.
2572686	2573067	Ever.
2573407	2574608	Ever in ten years.
2577150	2578351	What about a new Mega Man game?
2578371	2579312	Wouldn't that be kind of cool?
2580332	2582374	Well, there's... Well, how about taking Mega Man back to its roots?
2583395	2583955	Taking it back.
2584336	2584816	Taking it back.
2584856	2585497	Back to its roots.
2585537	2587158	That would be great if they did that.
2587618	2591441	Because I don't know what's up with all the... Mega Man Z. Battle Network, whatever crap.
2591461	2593423	They already did Mega Man Z, and it sucked.
2593443	2593723	Mega Man 9.
2594544	2594844	Crap.
2595184	2595645	Was it Mega Man 9?
2595805	2597046	I'd go for that.
2597326	2598147	Mega Man ZX.
2598860	2599300	Horrible.
2599760	2601160	How about just Mega Man?
2601440	2603801	You know, I think folks will forgive you if you just want to start over.
2603861	2605341	How about just redo Mega Man Legends?
2605461	2606581	Legends was pretty fun.
2607642	2608002	Legends 3.
2608862	2610542	Seriously, bring Tron Bon back.
2610962	2611462	Alright, I'm done.
2611482	2612482	Alright, anyways.
2614123	2617423	Finally, this kind of goes... Gotta bring it full circle.
2617643	2619084	Back to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
2620284	2622204	Move over, King Kong!
2622224	2627405	There's a new leader of ultimate easy achievement points, and that is TMNT, the game.
2628354	2629075	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2649546	2650527	TeamXbox GameSpot
2678627	2684969	Even still, the better graphics and achievements ultimately make the 360 version the best by default.
2686429	2686649	Hmm.
2687730	2688090	Interesting.
2689390	2689991	I might check it out.
2690031	2692791	It seems like something that would be like a rental, but I don't know if I'd buy that.
2693312	2694932	Especially just for a thousand achievement points.
2694972	2695632	I don't care, you know.
2696252	2699914	The Tetris game I bought today seems to have, you know, okay achievement points.
2699974	2703595	Like, it's doable if you are any good at Tetris.
2703915	2704355	I'm telling you.
2704375	2704595	We'll see.
2705054	2706075	Earth Defense Force 2017.
2706855	2709997	It's the dumbest game on the face of the earth, but so fun to play.
2710238	2713620	But do you have easy... Not easy achieving points at all.
2714000	2718163	Although, actually, no, probably beating a game on easy and normal would be relatively easy.
2718623	2719964	Although normal is pretty hard.
2720384	2721205	But that's what's kind of...
2721986	2725770	Skypline is open by the way, username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR
2741670	2747352	And plus you unlock different weapons that might help out with playing through the levels at harder difficulty or something like that.
2747632	2749273	So there's a lot of strategy involved there.
2749733	2752114	Plus it's just so cheesy and stupid that you gotta play it.
2752834	2757556	I mean, because your other guys will yell weird shit like, Oh no!
2757656	2758576	Tiny died!
2758816	2759337	Oh no!
2759517	2760537	Big stuff died!
2760877	2761237	I don't know.
2761698	2765099	I just want to keep playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night right now, to be honest.
2765919	2767320	All over again, like it was the first time.
2767520	2767920	Heck yeah.
2768288	2770108	We got a call on the old Skype line.
2770328	2771329	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2771349	2771689	Who's this?
2772889	2774329	This is DMN.
2774489	2775729	Hello, DMN.
2776170	2776830	Long time no talk.
2776870	2778590	This is CNN.
2779710	2780190	No, it's not.
2780250	2781251	Don't get us sued.
2781311	2782191	This is OLR.
2782411	2783231	What's on your mind, DMN?
2784271	2790552	Well, I came across your website a couple days ago, and I noticed the Katamari story got removed.
2791733	2792093	Interesting.
2792113	2792853	You should bring that up.
2794973	2796034	Well, what do you want to say about it?
2797934	2798094	Um...
2798706	2801468	Fuck Gamespot and everything it stands for regarding that.
2803850	2809334	Didn't they pull the story up only a few days after and not even cite Orange Lounge Radio for it?
2810655	2812496	I can't comment on this at this time.
2812876	2817139	Next week we'll have an official statement on what's going on, but we can't comment on what's going on at this time.
2817940	2818320	Wow.
2819401	2819981	So that's it.
2821102	2821482	Okay.
2821902	2823203	Anything else you want to ask us about?
2823684	2825125	Thanks for bringing that up.
2828956	2829356	That's alright.
2830377	2832237	What'd you say, Mikotov?
2832257	2837259	I was going to ask him about how much he hates the stupid people in WoW, because he was complaining about it earlier.
2837299	2838420	Oh yeah, you're in our WoW guild.
2838440	2839240	What's going on in WoW?
2842161	2847623	I'm just getting sick of all the stupid people who think that internet shorthand is okay in that fucking game.
2848003	2850664	Like, it's acceptable to a degree.
2852345	2854246	Like LOL and stuff like that?
2855726	2856086	Okay.
2856927	2857667	For example...
2859853	2861754	Don't use the letter U to represent you.
2862295	2864576	It's two extra fucking letters you can type.
2865997	2867218	Y-O-U.
2867418	2868398	Jesus Christ.
2868458	2876724	Isn't there some type of add-on that you can get for World of Warcraft that will allow you to automatically, like, I remember Drew Nami was telling me about this once when he was here.
2876744	2883728	It was something about, like, I don't know, some filter that would automatically, like, change the letter U into Y-O-U, and it would change, like, a lot of the noob speak for you.
2885129	2886250	God, I need to find that.
2886310	2887030	Drew Nami's in chat.
2887050	2888091	He says it's called Eloquence.
2888769	2889409	is what it's called.
2889630	2896794	I'll have to pick that up because I don't mind typing out full words and full sentences, but I guess I'm the only person.
2897835	2901277	That's why you should just stay with your guild because we all type normally.
2901898	2902638	I love my guild.
2902658	2903398	My guild's awesome.
2903739	2904459	We are awesome.
2904799	2908262	And go vote for the songs for the STFU song tournament.
2908282	2909322	We're at the Sweet 16.
2909382	2911664	The big matchup right now is Colors vs. So Deep.
2912765	2913305	So Deep.
2913665	2914426	Go So Deep.
2914446	2916267	You guys should vote and
2917388	2919090	Ready, set, Rob's going to hang up on me.
2919190	2920311	No, I'm not.
2920351	2923513	But thank you very much for striking the nerve and allowing me to tease next week.
2925615	2925995	No problem.
2926015	2926555	Have a good weekend.
2926615	2927216	All right, you too.
2928076	2928497	All right, bye.
2928697	2928937	Bye.
2929037	2929818	Bye, DMN.
2930879	2935002	If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number.
2935482	2939285	Or you can call us, username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
2940846	2942928	I swear we didn't pay him to call in and ask about that.
2945982	2946842	Funny you should mention that.
2946862	2948763	Loki and I were just talking about that before the show.
2949904	2950904	Let's go to another call.
2951264	2952285	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2952305	2952685	Who's this?
2953985	2956046	It's Legend of Zaku.
2956066	2957927	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
2958007	2958607	What's on your mind?
2961208	2970292	Nah, just chilling, nothing much, but I'm off the heels of a shitty tournament that I went to yesterday that I'm getting filmed for a DDR documentary.
2970552	2973133	You went to a DDR tournament yesterday that was shitty.
2973193	2973913	What tournament was this?
2974926	2982493	This was one hour long island, far from where I live, but me and three other players from the city just went out there.
2982654	2983975	Don't they have pretty good transit, though?
2983995	2985396	Because you can take transit out.
2985837	2987638	Of course, we took the railroad.
2987678	2988139	There you go.
2988279	2991402	You guys have much better out there when it comes to transit than we do.
2991502	2992403	It's kind of better out here.
2993384	2996307	I mean, the place we went to was really accessible.
2998245	3004767	The only good thing about it was the documentary that two NYU students were filming on DDR players.
3004887	3005788	What's the documentary?
3005808	3007388	I have to be honest, though.
3007528	3009789	A DDR documentary does not strike me as anything new.
3011509	3012229	What makes this one special?
3012249	3018431	Yesterday, this NYU film student was just filming the four of us through the tournament.
3025519	3030642	and just do our normal routines, just doing all the stupid things that we do.
3031583	3034004	And in addition, we were actually interviewed.
3034204	3040328	We were asked questions about the basic stuff about how long we've been playing DDR, what got into it.
3041069	3047312	And then we have other questions such as, how do you see yourself in the scene years from now?
3047853	3048493	That sort of thing.
3048553	3050034	It's kind of like a future perspective.
3051438	3056361	I was once interviewed for one of these documentaries and I believe it was right when we'd started Orange Lounge.
3056381	3059202	It was about a year after we started, but I don't think these people knew about the radio stations.
3059502	3066106	But I used to do freestyling under a pseudonym, Dr. Dick, and I just would get up on the machine and do an improv and just fuck off and I'd wear a funny hat.
3066573	3070317	and they wanted to interview me for this documentary and they wanted me to wear the funny hat and I said no.
3070577	3074020	Because I knew they would edit me to look like an idiot and I didn't want that.
3075982	3080105	Alright, so the documentary right now is still ongoing.
3081106	3090815	She plans on filming more tournaments in the next few weeks, especially some major ones, you know, some in the group 2 tournaments with R21.
3092656	3097478	Yeah, so there's only the tip of the iceberg right now, so she has plenty of time to work on it.
3097638	3103100	So it's going to be a little bit more in-depth than just a one-time thing.
3105340	3105641	All right.
3106121	3109102	Well, I'm sorry to hear the tournament was not all that fun.
3109142	3113983	What do you think a future tournament organizer should consider in planning a DDR tournament?
3114424	3115244	Fix the pads.
3115704	3117084	Needs better pads, period.
3117725	3121606	That's the only thing that just killed it right there is just pads.
3122395	3122835	All right.
3122855	3123575	Well, thank you, Zaku.
3123595	3124556	We appreciate the call.
3124576	3124836	All right.
3125496	3125676	Later.
3125696	3125836	Later.
3126096	3126216	Bye.
3126236	3126296	Bye.
3126456	3126756	All right.
3126776	3129757	Going to chat room and looking at comments while we wait for more phone calls.
3129777	3130057	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3152223	3154804	DDR Dollar Bill says, Dr. Dick, that was you?
3155605	3158146	Yeah, I didn't think there was anything on YouTube.
3158466	3160647	It was some freestyle video floating around for a little while.
3160667	3161808	I was just dancing like an idiot.
3161888	3162668	It was nothing serious.
3162868	3163449	It was just silly.
3164789	3165229	Let's see.
3166070	3167731	Blackboy, I guess I'm going to say this.
3167791	3172093	Blackboy in chat says, so wait, IGN or GameSpot ripped off OLR's news and didn't credit them.
3172853	3174914	No, that's not what's going on.
3175074	3178496	Again, we can't say too much yet because we're kind of...
3179728	3183952	Waiting to make an official thing, but we're not claiming that at all.
3184312	3193119	But what we will say is that it is interesting that other sites are reporting the exact same thing that we did, and other sites are continuing to run that information.
3193319	3194820	And I suppose that's all we can say at this time.
3195000	3195301	Correct?
3196361	3196862	Correct.
3197042	3197462	All right.
3197502	3199004	Then let's go to another call, that being said.
3201626	3203027	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3203047	3203407	Who's this?
3204208	3204788	Hey, what's up, guys?
3204828	3205249	It's Toshin.
3205849	3206590	Hi, Toshin.
3206610	3207030	What's on your mind?
3207970	3211472	I don't want to bring this all to a WoW tangent, but I gotta ask something, okay?
3211752	3211932	Sure.
3212592	3215654	Okay, in the last couple weeks, you've said you've been playing WoW a lot, right?
3215814	3216014	Yep.
3217295	3218375	How long have you been playing WoW?
3219956	3225019	Like, how many hours a week do I put in the game, or how long, like, have I been... Overall.
3225819	3226680	Overall?
3226820	3232183	This recent round, I just started playing right when Burning Crusade came out about a week after, so January of this year.
3232603	3234524	But I've played on and off since...
3235396	3237377	Oh hell, I don't even remember when I made the first character.
3237958	3241980	Probably about a year ago, I want to say.
3243121	3244382	Is it a hard game to get into?
3245223	3251427	Like, I must be the only one that I know, speaking for myself, that has never played a multiplayer RPG or anything like that.
3252127	3253028	Mikotov wants to chime in.
3253248	3256290	Have you started playing it yet, or are you just thinking about it?
3256810	3260833	Well, my friends, and I know a lot of people, including Rob, who have
3261169	3268593	I've played it a lot, somewhat, and I mean, I find it interesting and stuff, but I've just never come to, like, bring myself to invest the time in it.
3269233	3271754	And I was just, is it like a hard thing to get into, or?
3272455	3276417	It really depends on, like, what class you play, what, um...
3277318	3279859	Blizzard has it set up really easy for you to take your first hit.
3304079	3304519	DarkSakura.com
3326508	3329589	If you've never played an MMO before, it might be a little weird at first.
3329609	3330209	Yeah, I'd be a total noob.
3330229	3331130	So you're a total noob.
3331410	3340433	Well, that's cool, because you've called into this show enough before, and you've been in chat long enough, so that I know you're not a dumbass, and you speak intelligently when you type and everything.
3340573	3342434	You don't use the letter U for you and all that.
3342774	3347696	So I don't think you're going to really have a problem fitting in, so to speak, into WoW.
3348356	3351717	But have you ever played Diablo or a game like it?
3352566	3353728	I've fiddled with it.
3354288	3357652	My friend's like, here, take my map and run over to this spot on the map.
3357712	3359615	I'm like, what do I do if I run into something?
3360168	3361449	Click the mouse button or something like that.
3361909	3364271	Part of getting into WoW, don't be afraid to die.
3364391	3366153	Everybody dies the first couple times they play.
3366173	3370216	The game is not set up so that your character will get deleted forever if you die a few times.
3370276	3373638	Dying is kind of cool because it changes the way the game looks until you get to your body.
3374979	3375499	Die a lot.
3375760	3380223	I honestly found WoW a lot easier to get into than Final Fantasy XI.
3380243	3381684	I'm not trying to knock Final Fantasy XI.
3381724	3384146	I played it for a long time and I have some good memories from that game.
3384520	3385082	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3392273	3393754	I have a question for you guys.
3393794	3395556	Did you guys ever read the manual?
3395836	3396336	No, no.
3396797	3399159	That's like a really thick book that I definitely did not use.
3399179	3400480	But I never read manuals to games.
3400500	3402922	Yeah, nor do I. Actually, I'll take that back.
3402962	3406985	I cracked open Final Fantasy XI's manual because I got so frustrated that I didn't know how to do something.
3407005	3408486	I finally had to look it up how to do it.
3408607	3412510	I think I did too, but that was during the 13-hour install of the game.
3412530	3413751	I was just like, I need something to do.
3413891	3417134	Yeah, see, I think if you're brand new to MMOs, it wouldn't hurt to...
3417914	3419695	Toshin, I guess I end with this.
3419715	3420595	What do you got to lose?
3444569	3445930	Your life, actually.
3446190	3446850	Your real life.
3448391	3451492	You can at least get the free trial to start it off, you know?
3451772	3453273	Join Ravencrest and we'll help you out.
3453293	3455714	Yeah, Ravencrest Horde side and you can play with us and we're cool.
3456234	3456934	How long's the trial?
3457255	3457615	Ten days.
3457635	3458075	Ten days?
3459155	3463177	Enough for you to take your first hit and decide if it's something you want to continue and then you can go from there.
3463477	3464918	I know it's what, $12.95, $14.95 a month?
3464938	3467539	$14.95, but you get a limited character.
3467579	3468419	Well, how much Canadian?
3468619	3469660	Tosh is in Canada, so...
3470570	3471271	I don't know.
3471451	3471811	Who cares?
3471911	3472372	A little more.
3472392	3472852	There you go.
3472892	3473272	Who cares?
3473312	3474193	Who cares, eh?
3474613	3475374	Who cares, eh?
3475794	3476094	All right.
3477115	3477395	All right.
3477455	3480077	Well, Toshin, we hope to see you online, but if not, you know.
3480998	3481679	I'm in the chat room.
3481699	3482379	You know where to find me.
3482519	3482719	All right.
3482739	3482940	We do.
3483520	3485301	Any other thoughts or comments tonight?
3487103	3487583	Not really.
3487603	3491606	I'd like to just say, Travis, thanks for letting me win the game yesterday.
3492267	3492707	There you have it.
3492727	3494228	Travis Donovan live on Saturday nights.
3494989	3497951	If you want to know what the hell Toshin's talking about, you've got to download Saturday's archive, correct?
3497971	3498211	Correct.
3498800	3499260	That's correct.
3499280	3499600	There you go.
3530186	3532607	You were in chat saying WoW can be played casually.
3532647	3533227	I didn't see you doing that.
3533247	3539449	Somebody asked what's an MMO that can be played casually, and WoW has that rest bar feature that makes it very easy.
3539469	3549213	That's what I liked about WoW is that it has the rest bar so that the addicts get a little bit of a handicap, shall we say, amongst the folks who only can log in occasionally.
3549553	3554314	And that's what's kept me afloat sometimes in that game because I just went four days without signing in.
3554334	3555415	I probably have so much rest bar.
3555435	3556055	It's crazy.
3556659	3561440	It also just depends on the MMO you pick if you really feel like you need to dedicate a lot of time to it.
3561960	3565621	I played Final Fantasy XI casually, and that's not a casual game whatsoever.
3565801	3566841	One more call then, shall we?
3567021	3567641	Let's do another call.
3567661	3567901	Yes!
3569062	3569522	Well, hi!
3569982	3570242	Yes!
3570622	3570942	Damn it!
3571282	3572262	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3572302	3572682	Who's this?
3573522	3574723	One more thing, Raven's Dolphin.
3575763	3577323	I like how you've incorporated that into your name.
3577623	3579384	What's on your mind, one more thing, Raven's Dolphin?
3581024	3583384	The Sony PlayStation launch in Europe.
3583444	3584725	That's been on my mind for a while.
3585085	3585465	How so?
3585505	3586345	Why has that been on your mind?
3587847	3588687	We got shot!
3591048	3591788	We got shot?
3591808	3593929	We as a collective people got shot.
3595529	3598370	Did you get shot looking for your PlayStation 3?
3599651	3600951	Oh no, I stood in my bunker.
3601071	3601852	I was in my room.
3601952	3604192	There you go.
3604412	3607153	So you're saying you're surprised because we were all getting shot over it?
3607653	3608074	What's that?
3609154	3613675	Sony gave out TVs for the Europeans and I thought that was nice.
3614596	3615536	But they didn't do it for us.
3616482	3618823	Don't you think Sony kind of owed Europe something, though?
3618903	3620603	Like, sorry you had to wait six months.
3621324	3622844	Oh, most definitely.
3623764	3632347	So, you know, what's interesting is that the first hundred folks got a TV, but the second hundred folks got flak jackets in case they got shot.
3632807	3635108	So, Sony is very nice over there in Europe.
3635728	3639069	That's a one also on the jokes.
3639109	3640830	That's what I get for improvising here on the program.
3642330	3645551	What else is on your mind concerning this whole PlayStation 3 stuff, Raven's Dolphin?
3646138	3647419	Two more things, Skye.
3647539	3647779	Sure.
3649080	3656484	How is that bad ability testing going at the Sony Corporation?
3657285	3658906	I still stick to what I said.
3660127	3661407	Loki gave that joke a one.
3662028	3666130	I still stick to what I said when that whole joke came up in the first place on All Games Interactive.
3666170	3672514	If you're buying a PlayStation 3 to play PlayStation 2 games, you are buying a PlayStation 3 for the wrong reasons.
3673695	3674035	Okay.
3674536	3675256	I got a joke for you.
3676209	3677310	Goodie, I can't wait for this.
3677370	3678090	Alright, what is that?
3678851	3682553	Alright, a man walked into a doctor's office wearing saran wrap.
3682693	3683113	What?
3683133	3685134	What did the doctor say?
3685174	3685775	Let him finish!
3687296	3688356	Sorry, Raven Stolvin, what?
3689717	3695461	A man walked into a doctor's office and he's dressed in saran wrap.
3696301	3697222	What did the doctor say?
3697242	3703545	Um, why the fuck are you sitting in my office dressed in fucking saran wrap, you fucking freak?
3704466	3705667	No, I see you're nuts.
3713005	3713145	One.
3713486	3714266	I'd be a little nicer.
3714286	3715627	I'd give it a three, Raven Stolfen.
3716548	3717229	A for effort.
3717269	3718950	What's with the balls jokes?
3719451	3722093	First it was Bill Cosby, and now it's just some random guy.
3722433	3723114	They got the memo.
3723134	3723714	You like balls.
3725035	3725275	All right.
3725315	3725496	Okay.
3725916	3727477	All right, Raven Stolfen, thanks for the call.
3727497	3729179	Visit checkinggames.com.
3729259	3729919	All right, bye.
3737145	3737685	Good times.
3737745	3738126	It's great.
3738326	3739947	I think that's a good way to end the calls for tonight.
3739967	3740408	What do you think?
3741290	3743832	I see you're nuts, Rice Princess!
3744753	3746434	You're fucking nuts!
3749597	3750377	Is that it for the show?
3750437	3752899	Are there any other last-minute stories you came across, Loki?
3755461	3755942	I have one.
3756002	3756402	It's big.
3756702	3759084	I have a big last-minute story for you guys.
3760145	3769152	A little birdie has told me, and this is a rumor, but a little birdie told me that Paper Mario may be on its way to Virtual Console sooner than you think.
3769824	3773427	Super Paper Mario's release may coincide with that.
3774788	3777691	So stop booing Paper Mario, Miklatov.
3777731	3778471	It's a fine game.
3778932	3779673	So there you have it.
3780073	3781834	Don't count that game out just yet.
3781974	3784176	Wasn't that a GameCube title or is that a 64 title?
3784196	3790201	It was originally Nintendo 64, but I believe there was a paper... Yeah, there was the Thousand Year Door or whatever was on GameCube.
3790222	3791022	But the original was Nintendo 64.
3791082	3791443	Oh, cool.
3792423	3794505	Oh, I just got a good news story right here.
3794525	3795406	Hmm, what's that?
3799400	3827010	in actual news though here's another rumor for you don't laugh it encourages her and this is going to be even more confusing but apparently according to was it the NGC magazine in the UK an article in there said there's no screenshots of it yet but the UK version of Pokemon Battle Revolution will not have the restrictions of the friend code system
3829051	3829391	Really?
3829511	3830431	So that's confusing.
3831872	3839154	So, in other words, Europe might not have to, because they don't have child molesters in Europe, I guess, they're not going to have to worry about friend codes, maybe.
3839294	3839594	You hear that?
3839614	3842074	Or maybe they're just, I don't know, a little laid back.
3842094	3848036	Somebody needs to look Reggie Fils-Aimé in the eye and go, friend codes, yes or no, I want a clear answer, don't BS me.
3849256	3855137	What they should do is say, I will arm wrestle you, Reggie, and the winner decides the friend codes thing.
3855337	3856298	That's how it should be done.
3856438	3857278	But Reggie would win.
3858297	3858877	Every time.
3858897	3860598	You've got to get someone stronger.
3861598	3862758	We need to get Chuck Norris.
3863178	3864058	That's what we need to do.
3865339	3865619	Anyways.
3868500	3868860	What else?
3871140	3871780	Let's see here.
3872240	3877182	Three Speech, which I remember... A chatter sent me a story I need to read, but go ahead and do yours first.
3877222	3882143	Three Speech is saying that there's more download content on the way.
3882843	3886464	And I think, if I remember correctly, that's the semi-official Sony blog...
3887153	3895978	Anyways, Genji, Days of Blade, says more excitement will be coming, including new armor, I guess.
3897279	3901561	Oh, and yeah, new armor for your four playable characters.
3902782	3904443	Don't care, don't care.
3904763	3908185	Ridge Racer 7, supposed to be getting some more decal packs.
3909986	3912107	Ooh, so I guess that's neat.
3912776	3913676	and MotorStorm.
3913736	3918737	It says any PS3 player playing MotorStorm Online will receive time trial mode automatically.
3918998	3922738	That actually, I think, was launched this week, so I know that's going into effect.
3922758	3927880	There's supposed to be some new friend codes, or not friend code system, like a friends list system for that as well.
3928600	3933901	And Resistance Fallen Man, two new playable maps, Western Moreland and Kambor.
3934721	3935702	Those are coming soon as well.
3935722	3936862	I think those are coming in April.
3938304	3940505	One of our users, Meklar, wanted me to share this with you.
3940546	3941466	He sent me this in chat.
3941506	3942627	It's a story from Kotaku.
3943627	3948730	Somebody named John, I guess who's a reader of the site, just got home from the launch at the Virgin Megastore in London.
3949110	3951072	Apparently, they were all given some chairs.
3951112	3953633	There were some friendly folks on hand giving out some camping chairs.
3954213	3957215	And on the back of the chairs, it said, shouldn't have kept you waiting.
3957595	3961978	And it was www.shkyw.org.
3962078	3963679	And if you visit the URL...
3965137	3968479	Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next generation.
3969319	3970760	Sony, you're late.
3972780	3974021	Let the games begin.
3975402	3977362	And it looks to be just a big Microsoft ad here.
3977382	3978323	There might be sound with this.
3978363	3978883	I'm visiting.
3980124	3982004	It's just a little flash animation that goes on.
3982125	3984225	Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next generation.
3984706	3988427	Who knows if that was an official Microsoft-sanctioned thing, but that's pretty funny either way.
3988647	3991749	They had barges and stuff there during the France launch as well.
3991789	3992129	Really?
3993029	3993329	Yeah.
3993790	3994550	Ha, ha, ha.
3995851	3996171	Cute!
3996632	3997472	That's cute, Microsoft!
3997532	4006759	Apparently there is a 2D version of Ocarina of Time being made by some guy, looks like, named Richard, and he's dead now from a car crash.
4007579	4009541	So no 2D Ocarina of Time for you.
4009801	4014404	I'm so glad Loki doesn't report the real news, because he would have no sensitivity whatsoever.
4014424	4020889	In better news, though, Matrix is coming to HD, DVD, and Blu-ray, and that's awesome.
4021269	4024852	Can I say I'm sorry to hear about the guy behind the project?
4024872	4025372	That's too bad.
4026052	4026792	VEHICULAR VEHICULAR VEHICULAR
4055228	4055508	Alright.
4058089	4059549	Can we please end the damn show now?
4060549	4060949	What was it?
4060989	4061649	Viscarole?
4061949	4063050	Viscarole, whatever it was.
4066330	4071091	I'm glad you're here to make the occasional fart joke and then tease me about mispronouncing words.
4071392	4073732	What the fuck else did you contribute to tonight's show?
4075552	4076193	Awesomeness?
4076313	4076693	I don't know.
4078873	4079693	At least I think so.
4084500	4085100	EarthDefenseForce2017 Team
4113120	4115901	I guess I gotta wait until Super Paper Mario comes out before I get to play something new.
4116882	4117722	Or do I?
4119663	4121724	The hell's that supposed to mean, you smug little bastard?
4121744	4122585	I think you know what it means.
4122965	4123925	Alright, alright, maybe.
4124486	4132510	Alright, and my final thought, thank you very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting Independent Radio.
