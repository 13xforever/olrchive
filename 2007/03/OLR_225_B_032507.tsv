15480	19640	Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19640	23940	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on March 25th, 2007.
23940	26140	We tape Orange Lounge Radio in two parts.
26140	29240	If this is your very first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio to listen to us, please
29240	33860	check our RSS feed for past shows and you can hear part A of this episode where we talked
33860	39360	about the launch of the PlayStation 3, we talked about the black Xbox 360, and so on.
39360	42200	When I say launch of the PlayStation 3, I mean in Europe, of course.
42200	43200	Not here.
43200	46880	That would be old news and we try to avoid old news if possible on this program.
46880	51080	Dark Soccer is not here tonight and I was out of town for the past four days, so Lokiís
51080	55240	taken over the news tonight and I am simply commenting here with Rice Princess whoís
55240	58880	filled in tonight and is making the occasional comment while playing on the laptop.
58880	59880	Mm-hmm.
59880	60880	All right.
60880	61880	Loki, take it away.
61880	62880	All right.
62880	66240	Well, this week we had some more news that wasnít really favorable for Sony and it was
66240	72260	more exclusives leaving Sony and going to the Xbox 360, not necessarily being exclusive
72260	75360	for the 360 but for now for both systems.
75360	80840	So for example, the first title and actually big one, Devil May Cry 4, has been confirmed
80840	89440	to be on the Xbox 360 and the PSP, or not PSP, PC, and that is confirmed according to
89440	91120	Capcom Japan.
91120	94580	So that sucks.
94580	102800	And according to Xbox product manager of Microsoft Germany, Boris Schneider, Schneider John,
102800	108400	I guess, hyphen in the name, Devil May Cry is only the first.
108400	116200	There will be three exclusives total that are coming to the Xbox 360 and according to
116200	122120	that I believe it was Final Fantasy 13 and Metal Gear Solid 4, the other two.
122120	124720	Boy, that would be a one, two, three knockout.
124720	131200	I mean honestly, Final Fantasy 13 for me is kind of one of the few things that Sony seems
131200	136920	to be hanging on with right now because Xbox 360 kind of lacks really solid role playing,
136920	141760	next gen role playing games right now, I mean sure you've got Enchanted Arm but that is,
141760	148520	while it wasn't a bad game, it wasn't a OMG memorable, wonderful forever title and although
148520	152880	Final Fantasy 13 may indeed suck, it is a Final Fantasy game, there's going to be people
152880	153880	lined up for it.
153880	157560	Now, to be fair though, this was in his blog post because I guess everybody keeps blogs
157560	158560	nowadays.
158560	163160	Oh sorry, chat room says Blue Dragon, yeah true, you got me there.
163160	168720	And to be honest though, these are just kind of a shopping, a personal shopping list, it's
168720	174600	not necessarily anything confirmed, this is just a rumor for now, but Devil May Cry 4
174600	180480	is definitely, that's going to hurt and to be honest though, you kind of have to be stupid
180480	185240	unless there's a lot of money on the table to release something just on Playstation 3,
185240	188760	I mean especially if you're looking to sell lots of copies of it, there's just not that
188760	190680	many units out there.
190680	193360	For now, but we don't know what Sony might have in the pipeline.
193360	198680	For now, and there's companies that are doing that, I mean look at Ubisoft for example,
198680	203640	how long has Rainbow Six Vegas for the Playstation 3 been delayed?
203640	209060	A long time, it originally was supposed to be coming out at launch, and then it was delayed
209060	216400	to January, then February, then March, now I think April and possibly May, I mean that's
216400	220720	yeah, they're really pushing it along until there's enough units out there and it will
220720	223760	keep moving until Christmas if it has to.
223760	228720	Can I be honest for a minute though, you know how sometimes folks assume because we do this
228720	232860	podcast in our spare time and everything that we play every single game that's out there
232860	236280	and stuff, but that's not true, we don't have time to play everything, I'm going to be honest,
236280	238980	Devil May Cry is one of those series I never have played.
238980	242500	As much as I would like, it looks fun, it looks interesting, I just have never really
242500	243680	sat down and played it.
243680	248800	So to me, this news just kind of made me go, meh, that sucks for Sony, but that was pretty
248800	252640	much all I said, I wasn't really like, oh my god, you know this whole thing because
252640	257040	I'm not super into Devil May Cry because again, it's one of those series I just haven't had
257040	258120	a chance to get into.
258120	260880	If they lose Final Fantasy 13, that's going to be fun.
260880	267400	For me, that's a big deal because Metal Gear Solid, I am not that into that series as I
267400	272400	am Final Fantasy, if Final Fantasy 13 is lost to the Xbox 360, I have zero reason to get
272400	273400	a Playstation 3.
273400	274400	Honestly.
274400	278360	Um, my thinking though in this, and this is just kind of going back to what they did with
278360	282880	the Final Fantasy 7 series, is that they're going to release a version on Playstation
282880	286520	3 and they're going to release a different version on the Xbox 360, and then they're
286520	289600	going to have something else on the PSP, and then they're going to have something else
289600	290600	on the DS.
290600	295960	You know, they kind of do these ten title releases for one game type of thing, you know,
295960	302920	like they did with Final Fantasy 7, how uber ridiculous that was, so, I don't know.
302920	303920	We'll have to see.
303920	305080	And the game could suck.
305080	306080	I don't know.
306080	307080	Yeah.
307080	310520	I mean, look at Dirge of Service, perfect example.
310520	312440	So right now.
312440	315440	James Patrick is in our chat right now and makes a few comments.
315440	321600	Currently, by the way, chat.orangeonsrated.com, currently 360 has more JRPG's coming than
321600	324840	Playstation 3 because of the whole Mistwalker alignment.
324840	330240	Um, okay, I guess I could give that, although I don't, well Sony does have again the track
330240	331240	record.
331240	334640	That's kind of what I'm looking at right now with Playstation 2 and Xbox, and maybe that's
334640	338800	not a fair comparison, but you kind of think that okay, well if it was that way before,
338800	342120	but I get what you're saying, you know, they didn't have Mistwalker last time, and that's
342120	344640	a pretty big something something, I'll give you that.
344640	347280	Give me a break for forgetting Blue Dragon, I've been out of town the past four days.
347280	350360	I'm going to keep using that as my excuse as much as I can.
350360	355440	James Patrick says, also Final Fantasy 13 uses the white engine, Unreal Engine 3 is
355440	358240	being used for something they haven't announced.
358240	360720	But I would bet it's a spinoff.
360720	364840	There is something else, they are going to be announcing something new during that May
364840	367560	Final Fantasy party or whatever, so.
367560	368560	Interesting.
368560	372080	Jumpman says maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 for Unreal, I don't know.
372080	375720	Or how about a new series out of Squeenix, I mean it wouldn't kill them to come up with
375720	377560	a new series, would it?
377560	378560	True.
378560	382560	However though, fear not Sony, because not all is lost.
382560	389800	In fact, you may remember, I don't know, a while ago there was a partnership between
389800	397080	Namco Bandai and Sony called Celis, or Celius I guess, and it's a brand new partnership
397080	401960	that they are creating some brand new games, including three games that have been announced
401960	405680	so far and actually they showed up in Famitsu Magazine.
405680	411720	Brave Arms, which appears to be like a third person action game, kind of like Ninja Gaiden.
411720	416560	There was another game called Chain Limit, which is kind of a James Bond or Jack Bauer
416560	423280	style spy adventure game, and second season one, which is a first person drama sci-fi
423280	424840	action title.
424840	429440	And I gotta say from looking at the screenshots of it in Famitsu Magazine, those look damn
429440	430520	good.
430520	435500	So way to go, I mean that's some good stuff right there, you know, they just need to have
435500	440620	some more exclusive titles to them that look really nice, and you know, people will be
440620	441620	all over that stuff.
441620	443520	I mean, they look really nice.
443520	447200	I can't wait for these games to come out.
447200	454360	Anyways, so kind of moving along here, we've got some other interesting stuff.
454360	457840	More upcoming games, not necessarily for the Playstation 3.
457840	463120	Thing we talked about last week, Knights, which is rumored to be coming to the Wii and
463120	471960	pretty much confirmed in the official Nintendo Magazine in the UK and other sources.
471960	476040	But anyways, in other words, it's coming out, and if you think so at this point that it's
476040	479320	not, you're an idiot, or you're the biggest conspiracy theorist in the world.
479320	480320	It is coming out.
480320	481320	Yes.
481320	482320	Period.
482320	486960	One person though that's not really interested in the new Knights game is Yuji Naka.
486960	494760	And you know, basically saying that at the present, I have no such intentions to create
494760	500000	another game in the franchise, so much like Katamari, it will probably live on without
500000	502400	him.
502400	503840	Bull deal.
503840	506240	Let's see.
506240	507720	Moving along though.
507720	511320	Another game that's been in development forever.
511320	512320	Duke Nukem Forever?
512320	513320	Yes.
513320	514320	Oh wow, I'm good.
514320	520800	I didn't even peek, I promised I didn't peek over Loki's shoulder, I just kind of guessed.
520800	527920	It's still plugging away, and basically 3D Realms admits to screwing up and promises
527920	533840	that the new Duke Nukem game will be multi-platform, and hopefully will be out soon.
533840	534840	Other info...
534840	538840	Wasn't there some type of promise it was going to be out before the end of the year?
538840	539840	I still remember.
539840	540840	Was it last year?
540840	541840	I don't know.
541840	542840	Ah, fuck it.
542840	544440	I don't even listen to them anymore.
544440	548960	Some other interesting stuff though, it's rumored that the composer for Elder Scrolls
548960	553920	Oblivion has jumped on board to score Duke Nukem Forever, and a couple of things hinting
553920	554920	to that.
554920	559880	The first developer, Raphael van Lietrop, it looks like, discussed in his blog about
559880	565480	a recent visit from Julian Soule, the guy who did the score.
565480	570520	Also an insider's only interview at IGN, Jeremy left one hint about his secretive upcoming
570520	571640	project.
571640	573920	He said, when it's done.
573920	575920	That was another quote that they had for Duke Nukem Forever.
575920	579640	Let's see if we can get him on the show, because we had some guy from that site where they
579640	583940	sell his music previously on the program, and we were going to try and get an interview
583940	584940	with that guy.
584940	587160	Maybe we can try and beat him down for the details.
587160	588960	These are excellent composers.
588960	593520	Like Oblivion had some incredible music, and as did Prey, he did the music for that as
593520	594520	well.
594520	598880	Prey had some pretty awesome songs in it, but also Guild Wars has a really great soundtrack
598880	602160	if you've ever listened to it, and he did that as well.
602160	606900	That's pretty exciting if he's doing Duke Nukem Forever, but Oblivion and Guild Wars
606900	610720	are very medieval type, have a certain sound to them.
610720	615080	I would see Duke Nukem Forever's score sounding a little more like the Prey, but it could
615080	616080	be interesting.
616080	617080	It could be interesting.
617080	619080	He's a talented guy.
619080	623640	Well, since we're talking about stuff coming out, might as well start talking about what's
623640	627680	coming out this week, and I'm going to start off here real quick with what's coming out
627680	634080	in the UK, and you have lots of stuff this week, of course, with the PlayStation 3 launch
634080	640580	and whatnot, but now though we've got some good stuff coming out for you, including we've
640580	646120	got this week Gran Turismo 4 Mobile, although I would believe that when I see it, because
646120	647600	I haven't heard anything about that.
647600	652400	I'm not sure if I'll believe that, but God of War 2 is going to be coming out on PlayStation
652400	658420	2, FEAR is coming out on PlayStation 3 for you guys, and I know that game has been delayed
658420	659420	forever over here.
659420	661420	Oh, I'm sorry, you're doing the Euro date, never mind.
661420	663640	I was like, didn't God of War 2 already come out over here?
663640	665160	Yes, it did.
665160	666160	Just kidding!
666160	671800	300 March of Glory is finally making its way out to the PSP, After Burner Black Falcon
671800	678080	is also coming out, Bionicle Heroes for the Wii being put out by Eidos as well, Call of
678080	685920	Duty Roads to Victory for the PSP, Command & Conquer 3 Tiberian Wars for the PC, and
685920	691240	Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 coming out for the Wii, so that's a pretty cool lineup,
691240	695000	also I guess looks like a heat seeker on the Wii and the PSP, hopefully that stuff comes
695000	701000	out here pretty soon, and Medal of Honor Vanguard on the Wii and PlayStation 2 will be out this
701000	706480	week, as well as Test Drive Unlimited, and looks like Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell double
706480	710140	agent as well on the PlayStation 3.
710140	716240	For the US, we've got some good stuff coming out, of course this week, not a whole lot,
716240	720700	got a few movie tie-ins, like for example, Meet the Robinsons got some games coming out
720700	726480	for that, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, the Game Boy Advance, and
726480	735080	PSP, so, you know, lots of systems for that game, and of course on PlayStation 2 and the
735080	740740	Wii we have Medal of Honor Vanguard, which is going to be coming out, Metal Slug Anthology
740740	744000	is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, hopefully this week, because it's been delayed
744000	753520	a lot, let's see here, on the PlayStation 3, Splinter Cell double agent, so that should
753520	761760	be coming out this week, on PC, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, the expansion to that, Shivering
761760	767520	Isles, yes, that should be making its way on PC, we can actually buy that and then downloadable
767520	773240	on the Xbox 360, fucking need to play more Oblivion, I really do, it was so incredible,
773240	778280	I need to spend a hundred hours to just explore every nook and cranny, if you happen to be
778280	782480	in the mood for some really weird PC titles, I've got a couple titles, I think these have
782480	789160	to be my favorites for the week, Super Granny 3, on the PC, Rad, what are you doing Super
789160	798680	Granny 3, I'm not sure, but it looks pretty awesome, apparently, Guild 3, Super Granny
798680	804480	3, but that's still not my favorite title, my favorite title has to be this, Alien Disco
804480	810760	Safari, that one is, that has to be my favorite title of the week, and that's going to be
810760	817680	coming out, no idea, but maybe we'll see Super Granny 4 meets the Alien Disco Safari, Granny's
817680	824920	Alien Disco Safari 4, yeah, maybe, winner, Cabela's Alien Disco Safari, alright, well
824920	827760	I haven't been good for much this week, but at least maybe I can get out some Japanese
827760	831600	release dates, would that be ok? Would you have any exclusives, by the way, I didn't
831600	835840	hear any of the good stuff. You didn't really have too much to announce, of course, not
835840	839560	a big surprise, I think this has been announced originally, they said they were doing Guitar
839560	845200	Hero 80's edition or something, yeah, that was no surprise, you landed a date, but it
845200	851720	was weird, we got linked from some punk rock music news site, linked that, a lot of folks
851720	854840	kind of forgot that they've already said they're doing an 80's edition or they've hinted at
854840	861280	it, so a lot of folks are taking that as news for the first time. Yeah, this stuff is nothing
861280	866920	new, I just thought I'd point it out because everyone's got a big boner over Guitar Hero,
866920	872760	especially with the new game coming out next week, so that's going to be big, I don't know,
872760	875440	looking forward to more Guitar Hero, they're definitely keeping up with their promise with
875440	879160	releasing multiple releases throughout the week, they're not the only franchise that's
879160	884080	promised to do that, we'll get into that a little bit later. Japanese release dates,
884080	889640	before I get into those, looking at the chat room here, let's see, Mecklar says Super Granny
889640	895480	3, you have to save cats, that could be a joke, I don't know, and then Shadow Next Gen
895480	902020	says Shivering Isles is coming out the day Xbox Live is down, lol, and Joshi16 follows
902020	906360	up with that, it's only down for 14 hours, it's official, but don't those things usually
906360	911920	take longer than they say they do? Yeah, apparently it's not for anything specific, they said
911920	917080	they had a lot of work to do on the back end, so they're kind of doing that right now. Going
917080	922680	back in chat to the Duke Nukem Forever chat, the Rob D from This Day in Gaming says I like
922680	926960	how the creators of DNF, Duke Nukem Forever, actually take responsibility for screwing
926960	933200	it up, they have no excuses, just we screwed up. Dark Sakura made a cameo on This Day in
933200	940000	Gaming this week, by the way, check that out, it's hilarious. Japanese release dates, Xbox
940000	946560	360 gets Absolute Blazing Infinity, Call of Duty 3, and Asia gets the release of Rayman
946560	956020	Raving Rabbids all on the 29th of March. Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Mizase Suri Master
956020	961400	is coming out from Hudson for the Nintendo Wii, and this looks to be some type of sports
961400	966540	title that's coming out, it looks like it involves fishing, and hasn't this been announced
966540	971120	for the US as some other name? Because it's all fishing, is what it is, some type of fishing
971120	976720	game. I saw some screenshots for this. Maybe. Maybe somebody in chat room would know more
976720	982880	information about that whole thing. Let's see, also coming out on the, well that's it.
982880	989040	You can get some controller covers and stuff for like 5 bucks, 10 bucks on Nintendo Wii.
989040	992760	I don't know if Rayman Raving Rabbids is coming out, because that's another game that they
992760	996720	kind of delayed, it was very last minute too, it was supposed to be coming out this week,
996720	1001840	and then got moved to May. For the 360. For the 360. I don't know, we'll see. Coming out
1001840	1008440	on the Playstation 3, Winning Post 7 Maximum 2007 on the 29th of March for the Playstation
1008440	1014800	3, that's a horsey racing game. Enjoy your horsey racing if you are into that. Coming
1014800	1020380	out over on the Playstation 2, Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, I know a lot of folks are very
1020380	1026280	excited about that. Vitamin X. I like the name of this game. Vitamin X is coming out.
1026280	1029680	There's also a limited edition available. I'm not sure if this is based on an anime
1029680	1033480	or what, because I haven't been keeping tabs on my anime, but it's certainly got one of
1033480	1036680	those covers. Rice Princess, you know a lot about anime. Is Vitamin X an anime? I've never
1036680	1041560	heard of it. I think so. Vitamin X? I don't know, it's got a little cover there. It's
1041560	1046040	an action game. It's not ringing a bell for me. Maybe somebody in chat knows. Couldn't
1046040	1050440	tell you that one there. But also, this other one, this sounds like a very interesting game
1050440	1057300	coming out in Japan. Gaokan Utopia, Manabe Straight, Kira Kira Happy Festa is coming
1057300	1062440	out. And this is an adventure game with a bunch of girly anime characters on the cover.
1062440	1067760	Looks like a chibi punch and kick game. But it has a cute name. Yay. So, have fun with
1067760	1072000	that. Let's see if anything else is coming out on the other systems. Oh, Nintendo DS,
1072000	1077360	Digimon. Two Digimon games coming out from Bandai. Moonlight and Sunburst. It doesn't
1077360	1081560	really say what Vitamin X is, but it says it's a love adventure game by D3. Oh, a love
1081560	1087240	adventure game, huh? Does that mean it's like a dating sim? I don't know. Maybe. We'll see.
1087240	1092100	That's pretty much all I got for you guys over in Japan. Have fun with your chibi girly
1092100	1097480	fighting game. Well, the U.S. is going to see something else coming soon to your local
1097480	1106840	video store, I guess. Blu-ray release of the classic video game and arcade classic, Dragon's
1106840	1112840	Lair will be coming out soon. And not really a big surprise because it's been out on DVD
1112840	1118280	for a while now. And they expect that it's going to be on HD DVD at some point and it's
1118280	1123960	going to be sold for $49.95. Yikes. That's quite expensive. I don't know how you could
1123960	1128400	really, well, I don't know. I thought the graphics were probably as good as you can
1128400	1134080	get on Dragon's Lair. They can't really enhance it anymore. It seems a little bit pointless
1134080	1141760	to me. I mean, you know, Dragon's Lair has kind of already been done, you know, on DVD
1141760	1147400	and that's about as good. I mean, the original was on LaserDisc and it wasn't that pretty.
1147400	1152200	I mean, did they clean it up? Did they do anything to it? Not that I can see. Interesting.
1152200	1160960	Well, there you have it. Is Dragon's Lair a reason to buy a $600 PlayStation 3? No. Yes,
1160960	1167160	says Miklotov. Miklotov's just fucking with us. He's just kidding. Now release Super Granny
1167160	1171900	3 on Blu-ray and we're talking. Or Ultimate Duck Hunter from the bonus segment tonight
1171900	1176520	or whatever the fuck that game was. Ultimate Duck Hunting. Ultimate Duck Hunting. You'll
1176520	1182080	either kill the ducks or they will kill you. That's right. Wouldn't that be funny if like
1182080	1187800	Ultimate Duck Hunting like kind of was a little bit like Donnie Darko or something like that,
1187800	1193720	you know, where it's like a lot of head games and stuff. That would be awesome. And it has
1193720	1198680	what? What did you say about Jake Gyllenhaal over there? I'm sorry. I'm having private
1198680	1201900	message chat with other people in our channel. Well, he was saying something about Donnie
1201900	1206120	Darko and I said some other words and then I said Jake Gyllenhaal because he's in it
1206120	1211320	and he's hot. He totally is. I should totally option Ultimate Duck Hunting for a movie.
1211320	1217920	I bet they'd sell the rights pretty cheap. You never know. Anyways, so speaking of stuff
1217920	1223160	that's been delayed, Calling All Cars, brand new game that's supposed to be coming out
1223160	1227840	to the Playstation Network. It's going to be one of their downloadable games. It's been
1227840	1235480	moved to April and this is done by the same guy that did God of War, David Jeff. Basically,
1235480	1240380	I don't know, he's just hit a roadblock, you know, as far as putting it out on the Playstation
1240380	1245240	Network. Never really given any reasons why. He did have some gameplay footage of it and
1245240	1249840	it did look all that pretty. And he said though, I mean, he's not trying to compete with like
1249840	1256920	a Halo or anything or even God of War with us. I'm still saying it looks like crap. And
1256920	1260680	he says it's all about the fun factor. It did not look fun at all. It looked pretty
1260680	1267600	boring. So, hopefully I'm wrong and it'll come out to be pretty fun. I don't know. We'll
1267600	1272840	have to see. Hopefully they release a demo. Another game that's getting yet another release,
1272840	1277640	especially next week, they have Sing Star Pop coming out over here. Well, that's not
1277640	1282320	all. They're going to be seeing six Sing Stars come out by next year.
1282320	1285600	Oh, nice. On Playstation 2 or Mix?
1285600	1289360	Think both because I know Playstation 3 is getting Sing Star coming out in June.
1289360	1294240	But wasn't Playstation 3 only supposed to get like one Sing Star and that's it? And
1294240	1295880	then they download everything with that?
1295880	1300560	Well, I think so. I mean, but then again, I mean, you never know. Remember originally
1300560	1304200	Karaoke Revolution was going to have add ons to it and that never happened. They figured
1304200	1308180	out, Hey, we got like a couple packs here, a couple packs there. We can sell whole games
1308180	1313560	and make more money. So yeah, that's scary. And I'm not playing any of them.
1313560	1317540	Yeah. Act Deft was asking in chat the ultimate question. Will Loki buy it?
1317540	1318540	I will not touch it.
1318540	1319540	And will we put it on YouTube?
1319540	1324000	No, I will not touch this game. Even if I get it free, I will be burning it. Yeah. It's
1324000	1332320	a horrible, horrible, horrible game. Karaoke is awful. Now, of course, you know, stuff
1332320	1336960	being delayed and stuff. We've been delaying the mailbag for a while. So Rob, why don't
1336960	1343000	you make yourself useful and take Jamie's job, put on the gloves and dive into the mailbag.
1343000	1351840	Sure. Why not? It's the least I could do for my dear friend Loki.
1351840	1355860	Mailbag orange lounge trader.com. If you'd like to send us an email, I just randomly
1355860	1359620	picked a few emails for this week. So I apologize if I didn't get to you tonight, you'll just
1359620	1364520	have to deal with that rejection. Let's start with an email from Meglar who writes to say,
1364520	1368740	just a quick email to say you rock. And a quick little tidbit. I heard from a friend
1368740	1374340	who recently left the employment of Sega Knights is coming to the Wii, but also seems to be
1374340	1379780	heading to the PlayStation three and Xbox three 62. Seems to her the game now plays
1379780	1383900	like, Oh God, he just gave away who it is. I mean, how many female employees have just
1383900	1388620	recently left Sega? I don't know. Seems to her the game now plays like the magic carpet
1388620	1392800	from Sonic and the secret rings. Either way, it's something I'd not heard before. How about
1392800	1397580	you guys and gal? Definitely. I knew about the Wii through something similar, like a
1397580	1403860	friend of a friend at Sega, but I did not hear of PlayStation three and Xbox three 60.
1403860	1408260	Very interesting. If true, it makes sense though. It does make sense. I mean, you know,
1408260	1410500	Sega Knights is one of those franchises. I think people have been wanting to see come
1410500	1417300	back for awhile. So very interesting. I want new rez. Me too, but too bad it's a different
1417300	1422540	company altogether. Well, thank you for the email. Uh, we have an email from, uh, Sakura
1422540	1429500	max says, dear OLR first order of business, Rob, don't be such a tit. Stop the accent.
1429500	1434180	You disgrace my friends. Somebody is taking issue to my British accent. I do hit on the
1434180	1439380	program. Sometimes don't be such a tit about it. Just teasing. I guess part of the charm
1439380	1443020	is that my accents are so horrible. I don't know what else to tell you. Uh, second order
1443020	1448420	of business, Jamie, the reason I say Rondo of blood sucks is because it's on PSP. One
1448420	1453100	of the consoles I don't own and I've lost my loyalty to Sony. I don't know though with
1453100	1455820	it, with some of these big games, it seems like they're trying to woo some people back
1455820	1461580	to PSP. Is it too little too late? Yes. You think so? I was there a story this week and
1461580	1464380	I don't know if it's something upcoming. Forgive me, but I want to say I read something on
1464380	1468020	the internet before I left for my trip that said that retailers getting pissed that Sony
1468020	1471760	will not do a price cut on the PSP and some are threatening to, to just get the damn thing
1471760	1476460	off their shelves. Yeah. I was at the PlayStation, um, or destination PlayStation show. Apparently
1476460	1483220	they were demanding that the price be, uh, lowered for the system. I did see though what
1483220	1488940	they were, the GameStop was doing a special this week. They had, uh, the, was it the,
1488940	1492580	they had like a bundle pack a long time ago. Remember when the PlayStation or portable
1492580	1496460	first came out where it had like the case and the memory stick and stuff like that.
1496460	1502460	Apparently now they don't have that. The core system is just PSP charger done, you know,
1502460	1508180	so now, um, they were offering that one at $1.99 cause originally it was $2.50. So there
1508180	1513460	was kind of a markdown, but yeah, well I think they're, they're probably going to redesign
1513460	1519620	it or something. So get people to buy it again. All right, well there you go. Uh, sorry. Dark
1519620	1522780	Soccer was not here tonight to respond to your comment, but if we remember, we'll tell
1522780	1527900	her next week. Uh, third order of business. I just got DDR Supernova in my arcade. Congratulations
1527900	1532620	on being about six months late to that party. Just kidding. Fourth order of business. DDR
1532620	1538020	Supernova might not be too good considering the fact that the first one wasn't too successful.
1538020	1543740	I'm not, I'm not, yeah, I don't sure I understand that statement because what, what first one
1543740	1548720	are we basing it off of? Oh, do we mean like DDR Supernova at home? Assuming there's going
1548720	1552900	to be a second mix this year, which I can't possibly see how there wouldn't be one. DDR
1552900	1557540	Supernova, um, still one of the top selling titles actually out there. I'm surprised every
1557540	1562820	time I see that too. Well, there you have it. I'm not, it's a very, it's, it's not something
1562820	1567320	the hardcore players go for, but for the family game, like when mom and dad are looking for
1567320	1570840	a game to buy the young kids for their birthday, I'm sure DDR jumps out, jumps off shelves
1570840	1575380	for that reason. Yeah, we think he means Supernova 2 arcade. He just left a two off there. So
1575380	1580680	whatever. Uh, Sakura Max is the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old and signs that email
1580680	1586500	and says PS desk cap. I don't know. That's, that's what he says in his email. He says
1586500	1590500	the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old. Do your parents know you listen to this? Shame
1590500	1595500	on you. That, uh, closing statement right there just makes you realize why 12 year olds
1595500	1608260	shouldn't be on the internet. Ouch. All right. Wow. You're so awesome. Totally awesome. Um,
1608260	1613780	more emails. We have a email from, I, uh, I horribly apologize if I'm mispronouncing
1613780	1620780	his name. Nate and a I F could be knife. Nate, I think it's Nate. Uh, Hey guys, I really
1620780	1625020	love your show and I think it's one of the best shows on the web dealing with video games.
1625020	1629820	This week you asked us to send you our favorite jokes. Well, this is my all time favorite
1629820	1634300	joke because remember last week we had the email. I completely forgot about last week.
1634300	1639460	Well, here we go. We got a, we got a joke back. So we do remember we said voicemail,
1639460	1642020	not email, but well, that's all right. We'll take it cause I don't think we got really
1642020	1646740	any voicemails. So I don't know. I didn't check again. I've been kind of gone. Uh, so
1646740	1651700	here we go. Uh, I know it's an old one, but every time I tell it to my friends, they really
1651700	1655380	enjoy it. And I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did. So we'll, we'll, uh, rice princess
1655380	1660460	and a Loki and Michael top will be our judges on how funny this joke is. It's like American
1660460	1663780	idol for jokes. That'd be funny. Something like that. Although I kind of feel like we
1663780	1668940	should have like some music that plays with this or something. So maybe we should have
1668940	1671920	some joke telling music while we read the rest of this email. I'm going to play some
1671920	1678920	joke telling music. You ready? One day the teacher walks into her classroom and announces
1678920	1682800	to the class that on each Friday she will ask a question to the class. And anyone who
1682800	1687040	answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday. On the first Friday,
1687040	1691440	the teacher asks, how many grains of sand are in the beach? Needless to say, no one
1691440	1696440	could answer the following Friday. The teacher asks the class, how many stars are in the
1696440	1702440	sky? And again, no one could answer frustrated. Little Johnny decides that the next Friday,
1702440	1707440	he would somehow answer the question and get a three day weekend. So Thursday, Friday,
1707440	1712880	Thursday, Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping pong balls and paints them black. The
1712880	1716880	next day he brings them to school in a paper bag. At the end of the day, just when the
1716880	1721640	teacher says, here's this week's question, Johnny empties the bag to the floor, sending
1721640	1726120	the ping pong balls rolling to the front of the room because they are young kids who find
1726120	1732160	any disruption of class amusing. The entire class starts laughing. The teacher says, okay,
1732160	1738920	who's the comedian with the black balls? Immediately, Little Johnny stands up and says, Bill Cosby,
1738920	1745780	see you on Tuesday. That's pretty funny. I got one laugh in the room, a little chuckle
1745780	1750520	from Loki. Bacon. Are you laughing at the bacon or are you laughing at the joke? Joke.
1750520	1754240	All right. Let's go around and judge that scale on one to ten. It'll be like the gong
1754240	1757960	show here. Are we going to gong the joke? Rice Princess, on a scale of one to ten, how
1757960	1767080	was the joke? W. W? Yeah. Okay. Loki, on a scale of one to ten, how was that joke? It
1767080	1772440	would be like a seven. It's definitely no intelligent joke. I haven't heard it before,
1772440	1780600	so props for that. All right. And Mikolaj. One. All right. Why such a low score? Because
1780600	1784920	talking about Bill Cosby's balls is never a good thing and it's not funny. It's gross.
1784920	1788960	There you go. All right. Do you think this is going to encourage people to send us more
1788960	1795800	jokes? I have no idea. Ten for the bacon. All right. See, we all laughed at that. That
1795800	1803200	joke got a ten. Good job, Loki. See, none of you comedians will ever be as good as Loki.
1803200	1807480	Last email this week from our friend, DNL, also known as Renee. She's been on this show
1807480	1811040	before, but it's been a long time since she's been on the program. I know Renee is great.
1811040	1816120	Hi, OLR. This is DNL. I currently work at Perpetual Entertainment as an associate producer.
1816120	1819840	As you guys liked MMORPGs, I thought you might be interested in the game I'm working on called
1819840	1825080	Gods and Heroes Rome Rising. A brief description of our game is a massively multiplayer online
1825080	1829180	role playing game set to Roman mythology. Excuse me. I have the hiccups during this poor
1829180	1834360	email. Some key features is being able to play your hero character however you like
1834360	1839080	with six different classes and an extensive character customization. You also get to control
1839080	1845160	up to eight minions at a time, as well as have a visceral experience. I like DNL's use
1845160	1849520	of vis, where is there? Visceral? What's visceral? I don't know. I'm probably pronouncing
1849520	1855520	you wrong. What do you mean, visceral? Visceral. Yeah, sure. Visceral experience. Visceral.
1855520	1863800	Ten. I hate you all. This is Dark Sakura, never leave me again. With paired combat animation.
1863800	1868400	If interested, please sign up in our very active forums at community.godsandheroes.com.
1868400	1872960	Seven pointy things DNL. So I like how DNL is using our mailbag to spam her game, but
1872960	1877960	we'll give her that right here. In fact, why doesn't DNL get us an interview with peoples
1877960	1881900	from the game? We'll take them. Now if I can do anything and I can control up to eight
1881900	1888020	minions, can I like sit back and like drink ale and have my minions like kill things while
1888020	1891880	I just sit there and not do anything? Do I get level, you know, experience points for
1891880	1898480	that? I guess, I don't know. Folks, let's see, blackboy in chat says, wait, Sky's reading
1898480	1902400	an ad that was thinly disguised as an email. Yeah, I guess, but it was from a friend of
1902400	1907400	ours so I'm okay with it. And it's a game I hadn't heard about before, so there you
1907400	1912400	have it. We'll check it out and give an honest opinion either way. So there you have it,
1912400	1917040	that's it for the mailbag. Mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com if you'd like to send us emails. Well earlier
1917040	1922480	we were talking a little bit, we mentioned that the Shivering Isles was coming out for
1922480	1928280	the Xbox, well for Oblivion on PC and Xbox 360, but it was going to be downloadable on
1928280	1934120	the 360. Conveniently enough, there is some other stuff you can download off of Microsoft's
1934120	1941640	marketplace. Well, no, you cannot download porn, as Mikul Tov would say. That's not available
1941640	1948080	yet. However, they do need a porno channel on the IPTV thing. That would sell systems.
1948080	1955640	Anyways, Jetpack, or the new Jetpack game is coming out, if you might remember Rare's
1955640	1962320	kind of little logo there. But anyways, Jetpack Refueled will be hitting the marketplace on
1962320	1971000	Wednesday and it will feature obscenely colorful graphics, whatever that's supposed to mean.
1971000	1983360	That's obscene. 128 levels, multiplayer capabilities, the original arcade version, and continued
1983360	1990440	exclusion of the letter K from the title. And money shots, says Mikul Tov. It will be
1990440	1996560	available on the marketplace and will cost you 400 Microsoft points or $5 in real money.
1996560	2000840	Mikul Tov, you're giving this the thumbs down, is this one of those other games you've probably
2000840	2004200	played that you're not supposed to talk about? Does it suck? Can you talk about it?
2004200	2005200	It sucks.
2005200	2007000	Mikul Tov says, why does it suck?
2007000	2009560	Because it's not fun to play.
2009560	2010560	What the hell do you do?
2010560	2014200	You shoot things and then you fly away and it's really boring and it's not Boom Boom
2014200	2016680	Rocket, so why are we talking about it?
2016680	2017760	Well, the people want to know.
2017760	2020320	Well, they don't anymore.
2020320	2023200	Thank you very much, I suppose.
2023200	2034520	On the Xbox Live Marketplace, they had brand new heroes and villains that you could download
2034520	2042200	to expand Marvel Ultimate Alliance. It featured eight new playable characters, including the
2042200	2052040	Incredible Hulk, Magneto, Hawkeye, Sabretooth, Doctor Doom, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Venom.
2052040	2060120	They've got brand new signature powers, skins, dialogue conversations, and achievement points.
2060120	2061120	New achievement points.
2061120	2062120	Isn't that a Cyclops one-eye?
2062120	2065800	No.
2065800	2069160	Total porn on Xbox Live Marketplace. Now they want you to download one-eyed monsters on
2069160	2075880	Xbox Live. Does he blast stuff out of his one-eye? Total porn is what the Xbox 360 is
2075880	2076880	turning to.
2076880	2077880	He doesn't have one eye. God.
2077880	2078880	Does the Cyclops mean one eye?
2078880	2083680	It's a one-eyed monster that shoots things.
2083680	2086480	Like a penis.
2086480	2088920	You can, it's basically they have it divided up into two different packs.
2088920	2092240	Now, there's no need to go there, Rise Princess. That's just dirty. It's disgusting.
2092240	2100360	They have a hero and villain pack, each of which were 500 points, or $6.25. Otherwise,
2100360	2106440	you can also buy the combo pack, which features both, and save a little bit of money. It's
2106440	2112640	800 Microsoft points, or $10. So, saving a good $2.50 there.
2112640	2118400	And also, they have heroes and villains gamer picks that you can download, and those are
2118400	2122680	each 80 Microsoft points, or $1.
2122680	2127440	And Chat Room, yes. I was kidding. Of course, I know who Cyclops is. I did see the X-Men
2127440	2132440	movies. I watched the cartoon when I was a kid. Please. James Marsters.
2132440	2136040	Anyways, now let's talk about a game.
2136040	2139160	Why are you laughing at me?
2139160	2140320	Because you're funny.
2140320	2141320	And Visceral.
2141320	2145320	Go to hell.
2145320	2155880	Now let's talk about a game that came out a couple of weeks ago. Ghost Recon 2. Apparently,
2155880	2160920	Mexico doesn't like the game too much. I guess it has something to do with the Mexican terrorists
2160920	2161920	in the game.
2161920	2164060	Fuck Mexico. Sorry, Act Deft. Sorry.
2164060	2169120	I think what's most interesting about this story, though, because apparently the game
2169120	2175120	has been blacklisted, and I want to say Chihuahua, Mexico. Is there such a thing as a chihuahua
2175120	2176520	Mexico?
2176520	2181280	Yes, but it has nothing to do with the dog. I mean, there's a weed California, Loki. Towns
2181280	2183280	get names weird things all the time.
2183280	2186760	But weed makes sense, though, because weeds are just out there, and that just happens
2186760	2187760	to be slang.
2187760	2189680	Chihuahua's not slang. It's a dog.
2189680	2194240	Or Chihuahua's like, you know, they're an animal that runs around in parks like we have
2194240	2197480	squirrels. And Mexico hates it because they don't bathe.
2197480	2198480	Anyways.
2198480	2204160	Wow. The views and opinions expressed. Act Deft says, and it's a state. Like, you know,
2204160	2206640	how, well, it's not really a state, but, you know.
2206640	2212400	Anyways, so Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior Fighter 2 has been blacklisted in Chihuahua, Mexico.
2212400	2218120	And, you know, besides the fact that the city's got a weird name, there has been apparently
2218120	2223080	orders. Mexico has apparently ordered the confiscation of any and all copies of Tom
2223080	2228160	Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior 2 that surfaced in the state.
2228160	2231160	This is a report from El Diario.
2231160	2233360	El Diario.
2233360	2237760	Is that also a town?
2237760	2238760	I'm guessing they...
2238760	2239760	After the water.
2239760	2245720	It's not El Diario. I think it's El Diaro.
2245720	2253960	A Mexican broadsheet, which says that the action was taken after Mayor Hector... I'm
2253960	2255400	not even going to start pronouncing these names.
2255400	2262960	I would fucking buy Ghost Recon if they had El Diario. It's like a terrorist in it.
2262960	2268720	They've slammed the game as being a crime against the intellectual capacity of the Juarez
2268720	2276640	residents. And apparently, they've decided to take action. So, in any case, Game Politics
2276640	2281280	also notes that a statement they took from the mayor who said that violent video games
2281280	2286280	instill values which are upside down, these actions are despicable because they attempt
2286280	2291640	to divide the goodwill of the residents of America and Mexican cities.
2291640	2297320	So, you won't be able to get your fix on Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior 2. However, God of
2297320	2302760	War 2, I'm sure, is still selling like hotcakes.
2302760	2307680	I'd like to give our apologies to ActDeaf and any other Mexican listeners we might have.
2307680	2312760	Hope we didn't offend you too bad, but seriously, El Diario. That was funny.
2312760	2317280	However, though, if you want to get in on some of that Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior
2317280	2321560	2 action, it will be available on the PC. They're doing the beta test, which is starting
2321560	2331840	in April. So, definitely go and sign up on the website, which is ghostrecon.uk.ubi.com.
2331840	2341000	I guess this would be the UK beta test, now that I've noticed that.
2341000	2345560	Anyways, so onto a different game. If you may not be able to play Ghost Recon Advanced
2345560	2351640	Warrior 2, and you live in Mexico, maybe you want to participate in the beta for Quake
2351640	2356480	Wars, because id Software is looking for some good first-person shooter clans to get in
2356480	2363680	on this beta test. And basically, what you'll need to do is have your clans register for
2363680	2375200	this, and basically you can participate by sending your application to etqwbetatestatactivision.com,
2375200	2380640	and with it following your clan name, number of active members, games played regularly,
2380640	2384320	and played competitively, your website, and details like that.
2384320	2391000	100 OLR achievement points to the first person to make the El Diario clan.
2391000	2395280	But Quake Wars looks awesome, can't wait to play it when it comes out on the 360. PlayStation
2395280	2399040	3 and PC.
2399040	2403800	Anyways, kind of off to a little bit of a different tangent here. Another first-person
2403800	2408880	game that's definitely popular out there right now is Gears of War, and New Line apparently
2408880	2416200	found time to register the rights for the movie, or secure the rights for the movie,
2416200	2420880	so that they can make yet another horrible video game movie.
2420880	2421880	Awesome.
2421880	2427080	Anyways, Variety was reporting that New Line Cinemas has snagged the rights to Gears of
2427080	2435160	War, and that Stuart Beattie will be writing the script with Marty Bowen and Wick Godfrey.
2435160	2436160	It'll suck.
2436160	2438760	Yeah, I can't say that I recognize any of those people.
2438760	2441440	How can it be good? I'm sorry, it'll suck.
2441440	2447920	The rights went up for auction with a 21-page treatment by Beattie, best known for his script
2447920	2451960	work on Collateral and Derailed. Well, Collateral and Derailed are pretty good, so...
2451960	2452960	The movie Derailed?
2452960	2453960	Yeah.
2453960	2457400	Oh, man, that was like the worst movie ever made. Derailed?
2457400	2458400	Yeah.
2458400	2460400	Yeah, with Jennifer Aniston?
2460400	2461400	Oh!
2461400	2462400	Yeah, I forgot to...
2462400	2463400	Oh, yeah!
2463400	2464400	Collateral's good, though. Collateral's good.
2464400	2469960	I never saw Collateral, but Derailed was god-awful. I wanted to, like, gouge out my eyes and stuff
2469960	2470960	afterwards.
2470960	2471960	I have my hopes for this movie, though.
2471960	2472960	Did it make you want to kill yourself, like Ultimate Duck Hunt?
2472960	2475160	Yeah. I was like, oh, man.
2475160	2479480	It could be pretty good. They could flesh out the somewhat-existent story and actually
2479480	2486280	make something that's entertaining and kind of interesting, which video game movies usually
2486280	2489760	lack. At least good entertaining, not, like, ha-ha entertaining.
2489760	2493400	Because that idea worked so well with Resident Evil and Doom.
2493400	2499720	Resident Evil is decent. Not this new one that has that horror from Heroes on it, but...
2499720	2500720	The movies, you mean?
2500720	2501720	Yeah.
2501720	2502720	Oh, they're all great.
2502720	2505360	Funny you should mention Resident Evil, because...
2505360	2506360	Segways!
2506360	2512560	I love Segways, because Capcom is having their Capcom Day, which I might add we weren't invited
2512560	2513760	to. Thank you very much.
2513760	2514760	What was it?
2514760	2515760	Capcom!
2515760	2516760	April 12th.
2516760	2520240	Why you got against Orange Loud Radio? Afraid we're going to say something we should?
2520240	2521880	What the hell was that?
2521880	2522880	My pouty voice.
2522880	2523880	Oh, my.
2523880	2524880	No love from Capcom.
2524880	2525880	Okay.
2525880	2527880	No love from Capcom.
2527880	2531360	Maybe I was a little hard on Dead Rising, but anyways.
2531360	2536960	Another Capcom Day is going to be April 12th. One game has been announced already, and that
2536960	2544220	would be the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii, and that's one thing that they're
2544220	2548840	hoping that will be featured there, as well as some info on Resident Evil 5 for the PlayStation
2548840	2551240	3 and 360.
2551240	2556600	Another thing, though, is they're going to be announcing a brand new game, and so we
2556600	2559480	don't know what exactly that is. Just a brand new game.
2559480	2563160	Evil Joe again, or maybe Mega Man. That would be nice.
2563160	2565440	Megalotov is adamant about a Phoenix Wright 3.
2565440	2568920	I hope not.
2568920	2572840	That's only the best game they've ever had in, like, ten years.
2572840	2573840	Ever.
2573840	2577240	Ever in ten years.
2577240	2579680	What about a new Mega Man game? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?
2579680	2580680	Well, there's...
2580680	2583560	Well, how about taking Mega Man back to its roots?
2583560	2584560	Taking it back.
2584560	2585560	Taking it back. Back to its roots.
2585560	2588720	That would be great if they did that, because I don't know what's up with all the...
2588720	2589720	Mega Man Z.
2589720	2590720	The whole new franchise.
2590720	2591720	Battle Network, whatever, crap.
2591720	2593720	They already did Mega Man Z, and it sucked.
2593720	2594720	Oh.
2594720	2595720	Mega Man 9.
2595720	2596720	Crap.
2596720	2597720	Just Mega Man 9? I'd go for that.
2597720	2599840	Mega Man ZX. It was horrible.
2599840	2603520	How about just Mega Man? You know, I think folks will forgive you if you just want to
2603520	2604520	start over with his name.
2604520	2609640	How about just redo Mega Man Legends? Legends was pretty fun. Legends 3. Seriously, bring
2609640	2610640	Tron Bon back.
2610640	2611640	Alright, I'm done.
2611640	2612640	Alright, anyways.
2612640	2620440	Finally, this kind of... got to bring it full circle back to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
2620440	2625960	Move over, King Kong! There's a new leader of ultimate easy achievement points, and that
2625960	2632080	is TMNT the game. Apparently, you can get all 1000 achievement points within 4 hours.
2632080	2633080	It is that easy.
2633080	2634080	Dang.
2634080	2640920	So, the game itself, though, hasn't been getting that very good reviews, but hey, it's worth
2640920	2643760	a rental for an easy 1000 achievement points.
2643760	2648000	What do you do in it? Did they say what the achievement points are?
2648000	2653680	They haven't said, but basically, the quote, Team Xbox. If there's one good thing about
2653680	2658080	TMNT, it's the fact that the game steals the title for easiest 1000 achievement points
2658080	2664040	from Ubisoft's own King Kong. You'll probably be able to get all 1000 in less than 4 hours.
2664040	2669200	Let's see what else here. GameSpot says there's also achievements to consider, but they also
2669200	2674800	happen to be incredibly easy to acquire, with many of them regulated to points for beating
2674800	2680280	levels and pulling off individual special abilities. Even still, the better graphics
2680280	2685400	and achievements ultimately make the 360 version the best by default.
2685400	2690960	Hmm. Interesting. I might check it out. It seems like something that would be like a
2690960	2694960	rental, but I don't know if I'd buy that, especially just for 1000 achievement points.
2694960	2700360	I don't care. The Tetris game I bought today seems to have okay achievement points. It's
2700360	2703560	doable if you are any good at Tetris.
2703560	2708800	I'm telling you. Earth Defense Force 2017. It's the dumbest game on the face of the earth,
2708800	2710320	but so fun to play.
2710320	2712120	But is it easy to use?
2712120	2716200	Not easy achievement points at all. Although, actually, no. Probably beating a game on easy
2716200	2721680	and normal would be relatively easy, although normal is pretty hard. But that's what's the
2721680	2722680	good thing about it.
2722680	2726000	It's open, by the way. A username, OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype. 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2726000	2731080	That's kind of the good thing about it, though, is because it is so hard, it will take you
2731080	2736600	a while to beat the game. Yes, it does get frustrating, but you can strategize and replay
2736600	2742960	certain levels to get your hit points up as you keep playing them. Plus, you unlock different
2742960	2747160	weapons that might help out with playing through the levels at a harder difficulty or something
2747160	2751320	like that. There's a lot of strategy involved there. Plus, it's just so cheesy and stupid
2751320	2757960	that you gotta play it. I mean, your other guys will yell weird shit like, oh no! Tiny
2757960	2760520	died! Oh no! Big stuff died!
2760520	2764600	I don't know. I just want to keep playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night right now,
2764600	2767320	to be honest. All over again. Like, it was the first time.
2767320	2768320	Heck yeah.
2768320	2773040	We got a call on the old Skype line. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
2773040	2774040	This is DMN.
2774040	2777440	Hello, DMN! Long time, no talk. What's on your mind?
2777440	2779720	This is CNN.
2779720	2784480	No, it's not. Don't get us sued. This is OLR. What's on your mind, DMN?
2784480	2789880	Well, I came across your website a couple days ago, and I noticed the Katamari story
2789880	2791640	got removed.
2791640	2798880	Interesting you should bring that up. What do you want to say about it?
2798880	2804880	Fuck GameSpot and everything it stands for regarding that. Didn't they pull the story
2804880	2810560	up only a few days after, and not even cite OrangeLoungeRadio for it?
2810560	2814860	I can't comment on this at this time. Next week we'll have an official statement on what's
2814860	2817920	going on, but we can't comment on what's going on at this time.
2817920	2818920	Wow.
2818920	2820960	So, that's it.
2820960	2821960	Okay.
2821960	2825120	Anything else you want to ask us about? Thanks for bringing that up.
2825120	2832120	What'd you say, Mikal Tom?
2832120	2836600	I was going to ask him about how much he hates the stupid people in WoW, because he was complaining
2836600	2837600	about it earlier.
2837600	2842080	Oh yeah, you're in our WoW guild. What's going on in WoW?
2842080	2846280	I'm just getting sick of all the stupid people who think that Internet shorthand is okay
2846280	2850440	in that fucking game. Like, it's acceptable to a degree.
2850440	2855600	Like, OOL and stuff like that?
2855600	2863880	Okay. For example, don't use the letter U to represent you. It's two extra fucking letters
2863880	2868400	you can type. Y-O-U. Jesus Christ.
2868400	2872280	Isn't there some type of add-on that you can get for World of Warcraft that will allow
2872280	2876520	you to automatically... I remember DrewNami was telling me about this once when he was
2876520	2880280	here. It was something about, I don't know, some filter that would automatically change
2880280	2883680	the letter U into Y-O-U and it would change a lot of the noob speak for you.
2883680	2886240	God, I need to find that.
2886240	2889520	DrewNami's chat, he says it's called Eloquence, is what it's called.
2889520	2895000	I'll have to pick that up, because I don't mind typing out full words in full sentences,
2895000	2896760	but I guess I'm the only person.
2896760	2901480	That's why you should just stay with your guild, because we all type normally.
2901480	2903320	I love my guild. My guild's awesome.
2903320	2904600	We are awesome.
2904600	2909600	And go vote for the songs for the STFU song tournament. We're at the Sweet 16. The big
2909600	2911600	match-up right now is Colors vs So Deep.
2911600	2914640	Go So Deep.
2914640	2919160	Alright, you guys should vote. Ready, set, Rob's going to hang up on me.
2919160	2923520	No, I'm not, but thank you very much for striking the nerve and allowing me to tease next week.
2923520	2926600	No problem. Have a good weekend.
2926600	2927600	Alright, you too.
2927600	2928600	Alright, bye.
2928600	2929600	Bye.
2929600	2930600	Bye, DMN.
2930600	2936840	If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number, or you can call us, username
2936840	2943000	is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype. I swear we didn't pay him to call in and ask about that.
2943000	2950080	Funny you should mention that. Loki and I were just talking about that before the show.
2950080	2951080	Let's go to another call.
2951080	2954080	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
2954080	2956520	It's Legend of Zaku.
2956520	2958640	Hi, Legend of Zaku. What's on your mind?
2958640	2966360	Nah, just chilling. Nothing much, but I'm off the heels of a shitty tournament that
2966360	2970640	I went to yesterday, then getting filmed for a DDR documentary.
2970640	2975040	You went to a DDR tournament yesterday that was shitty. What tournament was this?
2975040	2981280	This was one out in Long Island, far from where I live, but me and three other players
2981280	2982640	from the city just went out there.
2982640	2985840	Don't they have pretty good transit, though? Because you can take transit out to the whole
2985840	2986840	city.
2986840	2987840	Of course, we took the railroad.
2987840	2991640	There you go. You guys have much better out there when it comes to transit than we do.
2991640	2994680	It's kind of harder out here.
2994680	3000720	The place we went to was really accessible. The only good thing about it was the documentary
3000720	3005040	that two NYU students were filming on DDR players.
3005040	3009000	What's the documentary? I have to be honest, though. A DDR documentary does not strike
3009000	3015760	me as anything new. What makes this one special?
3015760	3025680	One day, this NYU film student was just filming the four of us through the tournament and
3025680	3032320	just through our normal routines, just doing all the stupid things that we do. In addition,
3032320	3038200	we were actually interviewed. We were asked questions about the basic stuff about how
3038200	3041200	long we've been playing DDR. We got into it.
3041200	3047960	Then we have other questions such as how do you see yourself in the scene years from now?
3047960	3051360	That sort of thing. It's kind of like a future perspective.
3051360	3056000	I was once interviewed for one of these documentaries. I believe it was right when we started Orange
3056000	3058640	Lounge. It was about a year after we started. I don't think these people knew about the
3058640	3059640	radio stations.
3059640	3063960	I used to do freestyling under a pseudonym, Dr. Dick. I just would get up on the machine
3063960	3067800	and do an improv and just fuck off. I'd wear a funny hat. They wanted to interview me for
3067800	3072000	this documentary. They wanted me to wear the funny hat. I said no because I knew they would
3072000	3078040	edit me to look like an idiot. I didn't want that.
3078040	3085880	The documentary right now is still ongoing. She plans on filming more tournaments in the
3085880	3094080	next few weeks, especially some major ones, some in the group two tournaments with R21.
3094080	3098280	It's only the tip of the iceberg right now since she has plenty of time to work on it.
3098280	3106680	It's going to be a little bit more in depth than just a one-time thing.
3106680	3111120	I'm sorry to hear the tournament was not all that fun. What do you think a future tournament
3111120	3114640	organizer should consider in planning a DDR tournament?
3114640	3120400	Fix the pads. It needs better pads, period. That's the only thing that just killed it
3120400	3128400	right there. The pads were pretty horrible. For certain players, they got lucky because
3128400	3133480	they were managing to get by, but they were getting a lot of pad misses. It just didn't
3133480	3134480	feel right.
3134480	3137640	Make sure your damn machine is working before you have a tournament. Fair enough?
3137640	3138640	All right.
3138640	3140960	Thank you, Zaku. We appreciate the call.
3140960	3141960	All right.
3141960	3142960	Later.
3142960	3143960	Bye.
3143960	3144960	Bye.
3144960	3150880	Going to chat room and looking at comments while we wait for more phone calls. 1-877
3150880	3157600	Game OLR. DDR dollar bill says, Dr. Dick, that was you? Yeah. I didn't think there was
3157600	3160680	anything on YouTube. There was some freestyle video floating around for a little while.
3160680	3164880	I was just dancing like an idiot. It was nothing serious. It was just silly.
3164880	3169080	Let's see. Black boy, I guess I'm going to say this. Black boy in chat says, so wait,
3169080	3174200	IGN or GameSpot ripped off OLR's news and didn't credit them. No, that's not what's
3174200	3181020	going on. Again, we can't say too much yet because we're kind of waiting to make an official
3181020	3186940	thing, but we're not claiming that at all. What we will say is that it is interesting
3186940	3191760	that other sites are reporting the exact same thing that we did and other sites are continuing
3191760	3195240	to run that information. I suppose that's all we can say at this time. Correct?
3195240	3196240	Correct.
3196240	3202960	All right. Let's go to another call, that being said. Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
3202960	3203960	Who's this?
3203960	3204960	Hey, what's up guys? It's Toshin.
3204960	3205960	Hi, Toshin. What's on your mind?
3205960	3213440	I don't want to bring this all to a wow tangent, but I got to ask something. In the last couple
3213440	3215800	weeks, you said you've been playing well a lot, right?
3215800	3216800	Yep.
3216800	3220160	How long have you been playing well?
3220160	3224680	Like how many hours a week do I put in the game or how long have I been?
3224680	3225680	Overall.
3225680	3230240	Overall? This recent round, I just started playing right when Burning Crusade came out
3230240	3235960	about a week after, so January this year. I've played on and off since, oh hell, I don't
3235960	3243180	even remember when I made the first character, probably about a year ago, I want to say.
3243180	3248760	Is it a hard game to get into? I must be the only one that I know, speaking for myself,
3248760	3252160	that has never played a multi RPG or anything like that.
3252160	3253240	Migotov wants to chime in.
3253240	3257880	Have you started playing it yet or are you just thinking about it?
3257880	3263320	My friends, and I know a lot of people, including Rob, who have played it a lot somewhat, and
3263320	3268360	I find it interesting stuff, but I've just never come to bring myself to invest the time
3268360	3272520	in it. Is it a hard thing to get into?
3272520	3278560	It really depends on what class you play, what server you're playing on. If you're playing
3278560	3279560	with friends or not.
3279560	3282720	I think, yeah, because the social element of the game is huge.
3282720	3287360	If you were to join our guild, you'd probably have a good time as long as you picked a decent
3287360	3291320	class to play around with. Something that's not so hard, something you can just pick up
3291320	3295720	and be like, oh, I can do this on my own without too much problem.
3295720	3298340	It definitely feels rewarding sometimes playing in it. It's pretty fun.
3298340	3302920	I think the nice thing about WoW is that Blizzard has it set up really easy for you to take
3302920	3308560	your first hit, basically. You can download essentially the whole damn thing and get easily
3308560	3313080	a 10-day free trial from somebody. I'm sure Migotov, myself, or any of us would be willing
3313080	3314080	to hook you up with a 10-day trial.
3314080	3318960	You can download it on WoW's site now, because you don't even have to know somebody that
3318960	3320560	has the game. You can just download it free time.
3320560	3325240	That's cool. It's very easy to set up and run with now, to at least try it out and see
3325240	3329160	if it's something for you. If you've never played an MMO before, it might be a little
3329160	3330160	weird.
3330160	3331160	Yeah, it'd be a total noob.
3331160	3334160	So you're a total noob. Well, that's cool, because you've called into this show enough
3334160	3338120	before, and you've been in chat long enough so that I know you're not a dumbass, and you
3338120	3342800	speak intelligently when you type and everything. You don't use the letter U for U and all that.
3342800	3348520	So I don't think you're going to really have a problem fitting in, so to speak, into WoW.
3348520	3352480	But have you ever played Diablo, or a game like it?
3352480	3357600	I've fiddled with it. My friend's like, here, take my map and run over to this spot on the
3357600	3361160	map. I'm like, what do I do if I run into something? Click the mouse button or something
3361160	3362160	like that.
3362160	3365720	Part of getting into WoW, don't be afraid to die. Everybody dies the first couple of
3365720	3369160	times they play. The game is not set up so that your character will get deleted forever
3369160	3370160	if you die a few times.
3370160	3373800	Dying is kind of cool because it changes the way the game looks until you get to your body,
3373800	3375600	so die a lot.
3375600	3380920	I honestly found WoW a lot easier to get into than Final Fantasy XI. I'm not trying to knock
3380920	3384640	Final Fantasy XI. I played it for a long time, and I have some good memories from that game,
3384640	3389680	but it was a lot harder to figure out the first time than WoW was. WoW was set up pretty
3389680	3391440	easy to just kind of jump into and go.
3391440	3395720	Well, I have a question for you guys. Did you guys ever read the manual?
3395720	3396720	No.
3396720	3397720	No.
3397720	3398720	Yeah.
3398720	3400440	I've never read manuals to games.
3400440	3401440	Really?
3401440	3402440	Yeah, nor do I.
3402440	3405280	Actually, I'll tell you that I cracked open Final Fantasy XI's manual because I got so
3405280	3408560	frustrated I didn't know how to do something. I finally had to look it up how to do it.
3408560	3412960	I think I did too, but that was during the 13-hour install of the game. I was just like,
3412960	3413960	I need something to do.
3413960	3418800	Yeah. See, I think if you're brand new to MMOs, it wouldn't hurt to go through the manual
3418800	3425000	and see some of the advice it gives and how to do certain things because my first MMO
3425000	3427800	was Guild Wars, and I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
3427800	3428800	Guild Wars was confusing.
3428800	3435000	It was confusing. When I started playing WoW, I thought I knew what I was doing, but I kind
3435000	3440000	of didn't. I looked in the manual, and it helped me a lot, so that would be my advice.
3440000	3443240	Joshin, I guess I end with this. What do you got to lose?
3443240	3444240	Money?
3444240	3448440	Your life, actually. Your real life, you have to lose.
3448440	3451720	You can at least get the free trial to start it off, you know?
3451720	3453280	Join Ravencrest, and we'll help you out.
3453280	3456280	Yeah, Ravencrest Horde side, and you can play with us, and we're cool.
3456280	3457280	How long's the trial?
3457280	3458280	Ten days.
3458280	3459280	Ten days?
3459280	3462120	Enough for you to take your first hit and decide if it's something you want to continue,
3462120	3465760	and then you can go from there. I know it's, what, 1295, 1495 months?
3465760	3467760	1495, but you get limited character.
3467760	3470240	How much Canadian? Toshin's in Canada, so...
3470240	3471240	I don't know.
3471240	3472240	Who cares?
3472240	3473240	A little more.
3473240	3474240	There you go. Who cares?
3474240	3475760	Who cares, eh? Who cares, eh?
3475760	3476760	All right.
3476760	3477760	All right.
3477760	3480160	Well, Toshin, we hope to see you online, but if not, you know...
3480160	3482440	I'm in the chat room. You know where to find me.
3482440	3487200	All right, we do. Any other thoughts or comments tonight?
3487200	3491520	Not really. I'd like to just say, Travis, thanks for letting me win the game yesterday.
3491520	3495480	There you have it. Travis Donovan live on Saturday nights. If you want to know what
3495480	3498760	the hell Toshin's talking about, you've got to download Saturday's archive, correct?
3498760	3499760	That's correct.
3499760	3500760	There you go.
3500760	3501760	Not pimping or anything. I'm here for Olara only.
3501760	3505680	That's fine. That's fine. Travis has an OLR program. We love having him on board.
3505680	3506680	Okay.
3506680	3507680	All right. Take care, buddy.
3507680	3508680	See you later.
3508680	3509680	See you.
3509680	3524720	All right, well, we'll see you in the next one.
3524720	3525720	Bye.
3525720	3526720	Bye.
3526720	3527720	Bye.
3527720	3528720	Bye.
3528720	3539720	You were in chat saying WoW can be played casually. And WoW has that rest bar feature.
3539720	3545600	That's what I liked about WoW is that it has the rest bar so that the addicts get a little
3545600	3549800	bit of a handicap, shall we say, amongst the folks who only can log in occasionally. And
3549800	3553860	that's what's kept me afloat sometimes in that game because I just went four days without
3553860	3556480	signing in. I probably have so much rest bar. It's crazy.
3556480	3560640	It also just depends on the MMO you pick if you really feel like you need to dedicate
3560640	3565720	a lot of time to it. I played Final Fantasy XI casually and that's not a casual game whatsoever.
3565720	3567680	One more call then, shall we? Let's do another call.
3567680	3568680	Yes.
3568680	3573420	Well, hi. Yes. Damn it. Hi. You're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?
3573420	3575760	One more thing, Ravenstaufen.
3575760	3578660	I like how you've incorporated that into your name. What's on your mind, One More Thing,
3578660	3581080	Ravenstaufen?
3581080	3584880	The Sony PlayStation launch in Europe. That's been on my mind for a while.
3584880	3587920	And how so? Why has that been on your mind?
3587920	3591120	We got shot.
3591120	3592120	We got shot?
3592120	3595640	We as a collective people got shot.
3595640	3599600	Did you get shot looking for your PlayStation 3?
3599600	3601960	Oh no. I stood in my bunker. I was in my room.
3601960	3606200	There you go. Well, what do you mean? So you're saying you're surprised because we were all
3606200	3608960	getting shot over it and what's that?
3608960	3614860	And Sony gave out TVs for the Europeans and I thought that was nice. But they didn't
3614860	3616440	do it for us.
3616440	3620000	Don't you think Sony kind of owed Europe something though? Like, sorry you had to wait
3620000	3621000	six months.
3621000	3623820	Oh, most definitely.
3623820	3629360	So what's interesting is that the first hundred folks got a TV but the second hundred folks
3629360	3635960	got flak jackets in case they got shot. So Sony is very nice over there in Europe.
3635960	3637960	That's a one also on the jokes there.
3637960	3638960	That's a W.
3638960	3642400	That's what I get for improvising here on the program.
3642400	3646160	What else is on your mind concerning this whole PlayStation 3 stuff Raven's Dolphin?
3646160	3649120	Two more things, Sky.
3649120	3656720	How is that capability testing going at the Sony Corporation?
3656720	3665560	I still stick to what I said when that whole joke came up in the first place on All Games
3665560	3670780	Interactive. If you're buying a PlayStation 3 to play PlayStation 2 games, you are buying
3670780	3673520	a PlayStation 3 for the wrong reasons.
3673520	3676160	Okay, I got a joke for you.
3676160	3678800	Goodie, I can't wait for this. All right, what is that?
3678800	3682600	All right, a man walked into a doctor's office wearing ceram wrap.
3682600	3683600	What?
3683600	3684600	What did the doctor say?
3684600	3689640	Let him finish. Sorry Raven's Dolphin, what?
3689640	3696920	A man walked into a doctor's office and he dressed in ceram wrap. What did the doctor
3696920	3700400	say?
3700400	3703280	Why the fuck are you sitting in my office dressed in fucking ceram wrap, you fucking
3703280	3704280	freak?
3704280	3706280	No, I see you're nuts.
3706280	3707280	One.
3707280	3708280	One.
3708280	3716420	I'd be a little nicer. I'd give it a three, Raven's Dolphin.
3716420	3717420	A for effort.
3717420	3722480	What's with the balls jokes? First it was Bill Cosby and now it's just some random guy.
3722480	3723640	They got the memo, you like balls.
3723640	3724640	All right.
3724640	3725640	Okay.
3725640	3727640	All right, Raven's Dolphin, thanks for the call, but on that note-
3727640	3728640	Visit secondgames.com.
3728640	3729640	All right, bye.
3729640	3738280	Good times, it's paid.
3738280	3740880	I think that's a good way to end the calls for tonight. What do you think?
3740880	3741880	Sure, why not?
3741880	3745920	I see you're nuts, Riz Princess. You're fucking nuts.
3745920	3746920	That's awkward.
3746920	3747920	Fucking butts.
3747920	3755360	Is that it for the show? Are there any other last minute stories you came across, Loki?
3755360	3759120	I have one, it's big. I have a big last minute story for you guys.
3759120	3760120	Let's go.
3760120	3765160	A little birdie has told me, and this is a rumor, but a little birdie told me that Paper
3765160	3771520	Mario may be on its way to Virtual Console sooner than you think. Super Paper Mario's
3771520	3779000	release may coincide with that. Stop booing Paper Mario, Miklotov, it's a fine game. So
3779000	3781880	there you have it. Don't count that game out just yet.
3781880	3784120	Wasn't that a GameCube title or is that a 64 title?
3784120	3789520	It was originally Nintendo 64, but I believe there was the thousand year door or whatever
3789520	3791600	was on GameCube. The original was Nintendo 64.
3791600	3792600	Oh, cool.
3792600	3794440	Oh, I just got a good news story right here.
3794440	3799440	What's that?
3799440	3802800	In actual news though, here's another rumor for you.
3802800	3804800	Don't laugh, it encourages her.
3804800	3813720	And this is going to be even more confusing, but apparently according to NGC magazine in
3813720	3822360	the UK, an article in there said, there's no screenshots of it yet, but the UK version
3822360	3829340	of Pokemon Battle Revolution will not have the restrictions of the friend code system.
3829340	3830340	Really?
3830340	3831340	So that's confusing.
3831340	3836920	So in other words, Europe might not have to, because they don't have child molesters in
3836920	3839280	Europe I guess, they're not going to have to worry about friend codes maybe.
3839280	3842440	Hear that or maybe they're just, I don't know, a little laid back.
3842440	3846720	Everybody needs to look Reggie Fils-Aime in the eye and go, friend codes, yes or no, I
3846720	3849360	want a clear answer, don't BS me.
3849360	3854560	What they should do is say, I will arm wrestle you, Reggie, and the winner decides a friend
3854560	3856560	code thing. That's how it should be done.
3856560	3858800	But Reggie would win every time.
3858800	3863920	You just got to get someone stronger. We need to get Chuck Norris. That's what we need to
3863920	3864920	do.
3864920	3874040	Anyways, um, what else? Let's see here, 3Speech, which I remember from-
3874040	3877360	The chatter sent me a story I need to read, but go ahead and do yours first.
3877360	3883960	3Speech is saying that there's more download content on the way, and I think if I remember
3883960	3887000	correctly that's the semi-official Sony blog.
3887000	3897240	Anyways, Genji Dazeblade says more excitement will be coming, including new armor, I guess.
3897240	3902920	Oh, and yeah, new armor for your four playable characters.
3902920	3903920	Don't care.
3903920	3904920	Don't care.
3904920	3910920	Ridge Racer 7, I'm supposed to be getting some more decal packs.
3910920	3912760	So I guess that's neat.
3912760	3917760	MotorStorm, it says any PS3 player playing MotorStorm online will receive time trial
3917760	3918760	mode automatically.
3918760	3922760	That actually, I think, was launched this week, so I know that's going into effect.
3922760	3926700	There's supposed to be some new friend codes, er, not friend codes, system, like a friends
3926700	3928760	list system for that as well.
3928760	3934920	And Resistance Fallen Man, two new playable maps, Western Moreland and Kambor, those are
3934920	3938380	coming soon as well. I think those are coming in April.
3938380	3941600	One of our users, Meklar, wanted me to share this with you. He sent me this in chat. It's
3941600	3945960	a story from Kotaku. Somebody named John, I guess, who's a reader of the site, just
3945960	3948960	got home from the launch at the Virgin Mega Store in London.
3948960	3952520	Apparently, they were all given some chairs. There were some friendly folks on hand giving
3952520	3953960	out some camping chairs.
3953960	3962120	And on the back of the chairs, it said, shouldn't have kept you waiting. And it was www.shkyw.org.
3962120	3969320	And if you visit the URL, Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next generation.
3969320	3975520	Sony, you're late. Let the games begin.
3975520	3978440	And it looks to be just a big Microsoft ad here. There might be sound with this. I'm
3978440	3979440	visiting.
3979440	3983800	Oh, it's just a little flash animation that goes, Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next
3983800	3984800	generation.
3984800	3987840	Who knows if that was an official Microsoft sanctioned thing, but that's pretty funny
3987840	3988840	either way.
3988840	3991760	They had barges and stuff there during the France launch as well.
3991760	3992760	Really?
3992760	3993760	Yeah.
3993760	3994760	Cute.
3994760	3995760	Apparently, there is a...
3995760	3996760	That's cute, Microsoft.
3996760	4005320	A 2D version of Ocarina of Time being made by some guy, looks like named Richard. And
4005320	4009720	he's dead now from a car crash. So no 2D Ocarina of Time for you.
4009720	4014320	I'm so glad Loki doesn't report the real news because he would have no sensitivity whatsoever.
4014320	4021200	In better news though, Matrix is coming to HD DVD and Blu-ray and that's awesome.
4021200	4025960	Can I say I'm sorry to hear about the guy behind the project? That's too bad.
4025960	4029480	Ocarina of Time was overrated anyways. Why would you want to make a 2D version of that
4029480	4030480	anyway?
4030480	4034800	I am so distancing myself from Loki's comments. Now is not the time to bring up that issue,
4034800	4037040	Loki. Now is not the time.
4037040	4043760	Because it's an incorrect statement. It's not overrated. It's overgood.
4043760	4044760	Overgood.
4044760	4045760	Yeah.
4045760	4046760	More gooder.
4046760	4047760	Overgooder.
4047760	4051440	More gooder. This for the person who is teasing me over the whole vehicular or whatever the
4051440	4054440	fuck I said earlier.
4054440	4059640	Alright. Alright. Can we please end the damn show now?
4059640	4061640	What was it? Visceral?
4061640	4063640	Visceral. Whatever it was.
4063640	4066280	Oh man, I have a funny laugh.
4066280	4070720	I'm glad you're here to make the occasional fart joke and then tease me about mispronouncing
4070720	4073880	words. What the fuck else did you contribute to tonight's show?
4073880	4080480	Awesomeness? I don't know. At least I think so.
4080480	4088000	Alright. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Rice Princess, we'll start
4088000	4089000	with you.
4089000	4093560	I just want to say thanks to everyone who added me as friends on the All Games Radio
4093560	4094560	community.
4094560	4095560	Yep.
4095560	4097920	Miklotov, do you have a final thought?
4097920	4099440	Why are you staring at me?
4099440	4100440	Nope.
4100440	4105760	Loki, do you have a final thought?
4105760	4113520	Well, I'm looking forward to playing more Earth Defense Force 2017. I guess I have to
4113520	4119680	wait until Super Paper Mario comes out before I get to play something new. Or do I?
4119680	4121720	The hell is that supposed to mean, you smug little bastard?
4121720	4122720	I think you know what it means.
4122720	4130120	Alright. Alright. Maybe. Alright. And my final thought. Thank you very much for listening
