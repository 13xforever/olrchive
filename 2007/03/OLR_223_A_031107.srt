00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:25,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 11, 2007, has Sony won back some fans with the unveiling of PlayStation Home, the Anharmonix Forge deal, and has an online poll foreseeing the return of Knights?

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:41,067
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gamer culture and gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:46,071
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:46,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

6
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:48,113
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

7
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:49,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I have salad.

8
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:50,755
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a salad, a yummy salad?

9
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:51,916
[SPEAKER_01]: I has a salad.

10
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I has Fresh Choice earlier today.

11
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:54,766
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good.

12
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:55,987
[SPEAKER_01]: It has Quiznos.

13
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:59,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have Fresh Choice all throughout the country?

14
00:00:59,088 --> 00:00:59,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

15
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:00,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a local thing?

16
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:02,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it's an entire restaurant that's a giant salad bar.

17
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:05,190
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way you get salad bars is if you go to Shoney's.

18
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:05,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Sizzlers.

19
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:07,631
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have Sizzlers in Alabama.

20
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:09,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what Shoney's is, but they don't have that here.

21
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:10,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoney's is nasty.

22
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so is Waffle House, yet it's still popular.

23
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:14,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Waffle House is not nasty.

24
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:17,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Waffle House has special drugs that they put in the hash browns.

25
00:01:18,936 --> 00:01:21,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

26
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,330
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole place dedicated to salads, nasty.

27
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:26,931
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?

28
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:29,792
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pita's dream, I mean, seriously.

29
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:31,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Or pita's dream, yeah.

30
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:32,753
[SPEAKER_06]: They have pizza and soup, too.

31
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:36,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, soup is okay.

32
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the fuck is pizza there?

33
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:39,276
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just so random.

34
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's healthy pizza, I don't know.

35
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:47,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I remember... God, I went there a long-ass time ago with an ex, and...

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I had pasta there.

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Pasta was okay, but salad is just nasty.

38
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,743
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what food eats.

39
00:01:55,743 --> 00:01:56,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't eat that.

40
00:01:56,764 --> 00:01:57,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I eat food.

41
00:01:58,665 --> 00:01:58,965
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

42
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:03,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's get into tonight's program.

43
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:10,510
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, actually, I want to say, Techmaster Loki, did you notice we did not get the FUs of the Week music automatically start playing?

44
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a good boy this week and made that not play.

45
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:14,552
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because he told you to.

46
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:15,192
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

47
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:16,913
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

48
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:16,973
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

49
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought of it all by myself.

50
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid Jamie revealing stupid behind-the-scenes stuff.

51
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:24,554
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow.

52
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:28,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I do want to plug the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

53
00:02:28,536 --> 00:02:36,500
[SPEAKER_05]: We have lots of boys and girls that come there to chat with us, kind of the fourth guest of our program when we don't have any other regular fourth guests such as tonight.

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,900
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't really have a regular fourth guest.

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,621
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of sucks.

56
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:39,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to get Dan to come.

57
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:40,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

58
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:42,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you know I was going to come?

59
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And his loud friends.

60
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:45,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably for the best they didn't come then.

61
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:45,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

62
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:49,563
[SPEAKER_05]: They're playing some car game.

63
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:50,504
[SPEAKER_05]: When's Marissa coming back?

64
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:51,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe next week.

65
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:52,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

66
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:53,466
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Chris?

67
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:56,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe next week.

68
00:02:56,548 --> 00:03:01,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm horribly broke, I have to have Chris and Marissa come up here for doing the birthday stuff.

69
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:06,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that might be when Rice Princess and Eddie come here too, so we could get everybody in here in one week.

70
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:07,516
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

71
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:08,357
[SPEAKER_05]: We could just all leave.

72
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:09,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.

73
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:10,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Three of us could just take the night off.

74
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:11,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them do the show.

75
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,540
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you say, chat room?

76
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Let Chris, Rice Princess...

77
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:20,152
[SPEAKER_05]: and Marissa and Eddie do the show instead of us.

78
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:20,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

79
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:21,112
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you say?

80
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:22,453
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take the night off.

81
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:23,694
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go out to eat.

82
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:24,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.

83
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:25,696
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Country Waffles.

84
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:26,897
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Fresh Toys.

85
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Our knockoff of Waffle House we have out here.

86
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:29,399
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go to Fresh Toys.

87
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:29,739
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,120
[SPEAKER_05]: They close at four.

89
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:34,963
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire chat room's at no, no, no.

90
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:38,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're only open breakfast and lunch.

91
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:38,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, damn it.

92
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:39,566
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

93
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:41,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we got a hell yeah from Zappy.

94
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:42,188
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

95
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:43,609
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR dollar bill, hell fucking yes.

96
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,671
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't love us anymore is what it boils down to.

97
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:46,905
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sad.

98
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:51,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, let's start off tonight's program the way we usually start it off with.

99
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:56,350
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week, where we talk about the games we've been playing this week, if anything at all.

100
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,090
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

101
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

102
00:03:59,191 --> 00:03:59,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, huh?

103
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:03,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and then Dan had to take it back, so he's just going to buy it for me after payday.

104
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:07,575
[SPEAKER_03]: The only freaking PS3 game I will play, like, regularly.

105
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my PlayStation 3 now.

106
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:11,697
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives me Captain America and Wolverine.

107
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,330
[SPEAKER_03]: In the same game.

108
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Although the damn thing is on the Wii and the 360 as well.

109
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:16,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

110
00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:19,776
[SPEAKER_05]: 360 achievement points.

111
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:20,436
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

112
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,499
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii could do flippy floppy movie things.

113
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:23,819
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

114
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:24,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like doing that.

115
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:28,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not like doing that.

116
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:34,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say, as much as I love the Wii, I think that when you have games that are made for play like that, that's one thing.

117
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,732
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you have a fucking platformer, just fucking put a controller in my hand and let me play.

118
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Exterminate!

119
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:05,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddammit, Tigerclaw, why do you have to drive the knife in my heart?

120
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:12,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming, I haven't even looked at chat, I'm assuming Tigerclaw's talking about how your Wednesday must have been.

121
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:13,189
[SPEAKER_05]: How did your Wednesday go?

122
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:14,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you, Marvel!

123
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitches!

124
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:27,016
[SPEAKER_05]: In case, for whatever reason, this is your first week listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you know, sometimes we talk about our personal lives as well, and one thing that DarkSakura is also a fangirl of is comics, namely Captain America...

125
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:36,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And which is funny because really on this program, I know you've liked Captain America a long time, but it really seems like, especially in the past six weeks, your fandom seems to have rekindled.

126
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:40,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I started reading all the Civil War comics and I was like, dude, he's cool.

127
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:47,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but then, so it was kind of funny that, I mean, not like funny haha, but funny like, don't call Jamie today.

128
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:51,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I saw it in the news that they'd killed off Captain America.

129
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So how was your day when that happened?

130
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,020
[SPEAKER_03]: He will be back.

131
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,380
[SPEAKER_05]: You think he'll be back?

132
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, come on.

133
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking, you know, Marvel needs money, so they do gimmicky things.

134
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:08,424
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was looking at your All Games community page today, and somebody decided to jab the knife through your heart a little more.

135
00:06:08,464 --> 00:06:12,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, somebody put a comment on Jamie's page and said, like, ha-ha, Captain America died.

136
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:15,586
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you say to those people that say, ha-ha, Captain America died?

137
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:17,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Died of fire.

138
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I thought.

139
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:21,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else in your week you want to talk about?

140
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:22,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

141
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like my salad.

142
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:25,907
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tasty.

143
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:54,765
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:47,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize that there were actually stages in the game so it's kind of neat they get to become different things including like a dolphin looking thing so that's kind of neat and then I played Motorstorm which Motorstorm is pretty awesome graphically and it's pretty fun to play my only gripe on it split screen multiplayer for one that would have been nice the other thing is you know the game looks so awesome and there's like some pretty cool animation in the little menus and stuff

145
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:52,001
[SPEAKER_06]: But during races, the fucking spectators are cardboard cutouts.

146
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:56,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're not even animated cardboard cutouts, they're just like stuck in a pose.

147
00:07:57,364 --> 00:08:06,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, I understand that, you know, you probably couldn't animate all these people in the game, even though other games can do that, you know.

148
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,670
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I was in the Gran Turismo HD concept at E3, right?

149
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, and I still thought I was retarded there.

150
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:16,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, they're probably trying to save on, you know...

151
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Calculations and stuff to make it run smoother.

152
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:23,456
[SPEAKER_06]: But the least you could do is make them animate a little bit.

153
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:28,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can kind of go, okay, at least that doesn't look as hokey.

154
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,380
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 2D, but at least it's animating or doing something, cheering and stuff.

155
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,222
[SPEAKER_06]: When I see just a person standing there frozen, it just looks retarded.

156
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:40,023
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something you would do on the fucking Super Nintendo or something.

157
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:44,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And even the fucking Super Nintendo had animated sprites that were cheering in the background.

158
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but those little dudes aren't sprites anymore.

159
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:49,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Sprites are so last gen.

160
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:53,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, it's still something that's sitting there in 3D spaces 2D, okay?

161
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:54,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

162
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So they could have done that.

163
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,127
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my big gripe on that.

164
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:00,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, the game's fun.

165
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:01,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of fun playing it.

166
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:08,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of last gen, AlphaCanongram in chat says, Loki, split-screen multiplayer is so last gen.

167
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:09,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, it's so last gen.

168
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:12,735
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why Halo 3 is going to fucking have split-screen multiplayer.

169
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:15,857
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why Call of Duty 3 has split-screen multiplayer.

170
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:18,258
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why Gears of War has split-screen multiplayer.

171
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck off.

172
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,600
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still in town, okay?

173
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:28,719
[SPEAKER_06]: No, last gen, it's because you can't fucking program a game that can have multiple instances of it running at the same time.

174
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,520
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's just lazy programming.

175
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, you know, I'm sure MotorStorm wasn't lazy programming.

176
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:41,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't like they downgraded from 1080p and 60 frames per second to 720p and 30 frames per second.

177
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, I still say, though, the game looks fun.

178
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:45,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks pretty awesome.

179
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:52,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other things that they probably didn't think about, though, when you're playing in first person, like, say, in the cockpit type thing,

180
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:58,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it's not really in the cockpit, the camera's just on the front of the vehicle, which is still stupid.

181
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:06,837
[SPEAKER_06]: But, if you happen to crash into something and your hood gets bent, you could actually not be able to drive in that perspective because it's blocking the whole camera.

182
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, totally makes sense.

183
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,658
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, anyways.

184
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:14,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So, other than PlayStation 3 stuff, um, let's see here.

185
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:19,280
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PSP, I was playing, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, which is fun.

186
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I also put some homebrew stuff on there, including...

187
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:31,753
[SPEAKER_06]: This game called No Gravity, which I might say this game right here, they could totally sell at retail and it looks a lot better than most of the PSP games out there.

188
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:38,879
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the fact that most of those games out there for the PSP are getting their asses kicked by a homebrew game, that's pretty sad.

189
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:47,947
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty sad that a demo for a game looks way better than a lot of the stuff at Konami, Capcom, whatever put out on the PSP.

190
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:49,889
[SPEAKER_06]: So it can be done.

191
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:53,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I just would like to see some more independent games come out there.

192
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:57,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe something like XNA or something like that for the PSP would be pretty awesome.

193
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:00,817
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's about it.

194
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:05,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm about to load the Thrill Kill and DDR5th Mix on my PSP during the show.

195
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, keep us posted on that.

196
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,421
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not actually going to be participating in tonight's show?

197
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:11,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, I will be.

198
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:11,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

199
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:12,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that in between.

200
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:13,202
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

201
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:14,903
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

202
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:18,324
[SPEAKER_05]: HitStun wants to know, does the retail MotorStorm crash every five minutes?

203
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:18,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

204
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:19,485
No.

205
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:24,809
[SPEAKER_05]: My Gaming Week Surprisingly enough, I actually played a little bit of Crackdown this week Which is usually not the type of game I would get into, but

206
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Crackdown's kind of fun.

207
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:47,371
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Grand Theft Auto, only there's no hookers to have sex with.

208
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:51,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And you jump really, really high and flying all over the place and all that stuff.

209
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:52,732
[SPEAKER_05]: But I find there's a lot to discover.

210
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:55,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like just walking around doing random stuff.

211
00:11:55,593 --> 00:11:59,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I don't really like having to fight the gangs and get into that whole thing.

212
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:03,196
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I like to jump around the Ferris wheel and do the little race around the Ferris wheel.

213
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:04,036
[SPEAKER_05]: That stuff's fun.

214
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:06,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And finding the orbs and all that stupid crap.

215
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:06,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

216
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times with Crackdown.

217
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,042
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple people tried to challenge me in co-op or whatever, or I guess you don't really challenge someone in co-op.

218
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:17,504
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted to play co-op with me, and I declined, because I suck at Crackdown.

219
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:21,726
[SPEAKER_05]: But this week, I'll probably actually play, because I was still trying to learn Crackdown.

220
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:24,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want someone to come into a game with me, and I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.

221
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:25,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I just shoot you?

222
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shit, I just blew you up with a rocket launcher.

223
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:28,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

224
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want to have a little skill before.

225
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sometimes I feel weird playing listeners.

226
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot on the Xbox Friends list.

227
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:40,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the listeners sometimes expect us to actually be good at games because we talk about them.

228
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,513
[SPEAKER_02]: They really don't know about you.

229
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:44,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hi, Rice Princess.

230
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:45,414
[SPEAKER_05]: You came out of nowhere.

231
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:45,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

232
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:46,535
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you say?

233
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:48,697
[SPEAKER_02]: You said they really don't know much about you, then.

234
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:49,258
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they don't.

235
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:49,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha.

236
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:50,319
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

237
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,060
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a jab at you.

238
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:55,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeremy Tau once said, Rob didn't want to play co-op with me.

239
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:56,664
[SPEAKER_05]: He denied me when I asked to join his game.

240
00:12:57,065 --> 00:13:02,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that may not have been me because the other thing you have to keep in mind is that Shane has been playing my game without asking, by the way.

241
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: You're having a fluffer takeover.

242
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:32,712
[SPEAKER_05]: What, Loki?

243
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:35,634
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're having an e-penis fluffer takeover.

244
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:37,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Shane is fluffing my e-penis.

245
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:38,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe right now as we speak.

246
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't make a face, Rice Princess.

247
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:43,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice Princess, how was your gaming week, if you have anything to share?

248
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guess what?

249
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:47,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing WoW.

250
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:47,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you?

251
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:49,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, you played WoW.

252
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's the same as every other week.

253
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I play a lot of World of Warcraft as well, actually.

254
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:54,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

255
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:56,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost every time I come on, I see you.

256
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:58,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a troll.

257
00:13:58,929 --> 00:13:59,630
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a troll.

258
00:14:00,515 --> 00:14:01,677
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

259
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,903
[SPEAKER_05]: with all your gear.

260
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 29, get it right.

261
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:22,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's 29 now.

262
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:29,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you told me when I went and played on your server once, it was like, you go to 19 and then you stop and you play nothing but Warsong Gulch for the rest of your life.

263
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:35,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I did originally, but then I discovered the world of 29 and I was like, wow, you get poisons as a rogue.

264
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:38,496
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get Arathi Basin, which I think is an awesome PvP.

265
00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:40,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

266
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Warsong Gulch is so last gen.

267
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, yeah.

268
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:47,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, who does that anymore?

269
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:47,202
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

270
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:49,399
[SPEAKER_02]: All that Isla Storm.

271
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:49,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

272
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:24,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, twinks are like the young, hot boys, right?

273
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:30,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the good-looking ones that... Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but sure, I guess I get what you're getting at.

274
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:32,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Like magazine-looking guys.

275
00:15:32,587 --> 00:15:35,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you elaborate on what exactly a gay twink is?

276
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:44,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if all the listeners want to... It's basically a person who... I would think a guy who kind of looks underage who isn't.

277
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:47,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Like your blonde hair, blue-eyed, that whole thing.

278
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:48,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

279
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:51,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely waxed everywhere type look.

280
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, the best looking, like, no?

281
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:57,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of an unnatural look.

282
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:59,608
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with, like, an age thing?

283
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:01,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we really have to keep going with this topic?

284
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:05,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because then it's going to, like, maybe my perception of what a twink is is different.

285
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you know good enough.

286
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:12,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I thought it was, like, you know, it had something to do with, like, old men liking twinks.

287
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:15,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would, like, be their sugar daddies and give them a lot of money and stuff.

288
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, I don't know.

289
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:20,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, like, okay, well, to be a twink, you have to have a lot of money to pay for your stuff.

290
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:26,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe twinking is, like, whoring yourself out to, like, get money to get all these awesome enchants and stuff.

291
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:28,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but that's just a theory.

292
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:29,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know.

293
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:32,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I just heard a bunch of people say, oh, twink, twink, twink.

294
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, okay, sure.

295
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:35,092
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I am.

296
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:37,533
[SPEAKER_02]: If by twink you mean awesome.

297
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:38,873
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

298
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:43,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to see if there's anything in the chat room here that says what's going on.

299
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:46,266
[SPEAKER_05]: JV Mon says, welcome to gay slang chat on OLR.

300
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:47,647
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it.

301
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:48,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

302
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:58,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeenix says, in the gay slang, twink is a term that describes a young or young-looking male usually of slender build with little to no body hair.

303
00:16:58,854 --> 00:17:00,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Often they are described as blonde hair and blue eyed.

304
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:05,859
[SPEAKER_05]: To many gay men, the term is pejorative and implies shallowness and stupidity.

305
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Twinks are typically contrasted with bears, and that's from Wikipedia.

306
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:10,546
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you have it.

307
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:14,248
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't say anything about how the hell, then, did they get the name in World of Warcraft?

308
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:15,749
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

309
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:17,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

310
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize there were so many gay players in WoW, right?

311
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:21,252
[SPEAKER_02]: That they would come up with a different name.

312
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:21,992
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm done.

313
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:22,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done with this topic.

314
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:24,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're done with that.

315
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:25,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done with that.

316
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about other news.

317
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:27,275
[SPEAKER_05]: You do that.

318
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:29,376
[SPEAKER_02]: But I only stopped by to say hi, so I'm going to leave now.

319
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:30,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, get out.

320
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:31,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, listeners.

321
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:32,117
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't like you anyway.

322
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:32,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

323
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out.

324
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:34,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish everyone hates me.

325
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:43,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, well, most of the podcasts you're listening to this week are probably going to be talking a lot about their experiences at Game Developers Conference.

326
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:45,413
[SPEAKER_05]: But not us, we didn't go.

327
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:46,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

328
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:52,235
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, we sat home on our big butts and read about it on the internet, just like most of you guys out there did at home.

329
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:57,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I was originally going to go to Game Developers Conference, but some things came up and I didn't end up going.

330
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:00,177
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did get to...

331
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:07,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to San Francisco yesterday to meet some people that we, you know, because if I had gone to Game Developers Conference, it would have been like a networking thing.

332
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:10,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I would have gotten to meet a lot of people and all that stuff.

333
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:15,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did is we drove to San Francisco because some of our buddies over at All Games were in town.

334
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:18,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, we rebroadcast our program over on All Games on Monday nights.

335
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:21,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went over and met with some of the All Games folks.

336
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:26,098
[SPEAKER_05]: We met with Bobby and we met with Lawrence, although Lawrence we were basically taking to the airport.

337
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:27,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't get to spend a lot of time with him.

338
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:44,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, who does the other Sunday Night Show you might listen to over on All Games, we spent some time with him when we went to Sunnyvale Golf Land, which is a pretty big arcade, kind of infamous in Northern California for the many fighting game tournaments it's had and DDR music game tournaments it's had.

339
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:53,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of sad to go in there and see the place as basically turned into the entire middle where they used to have tons of classic games.

340
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:58,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, they had like the old school fighting games and stuff were all up in the middle section.

341
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:00,935
[SPEAKER_05]: All gone, and it's all ticket spitters now.

342
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:03,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Which kind of made me sad.

343
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:03,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

344
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:14,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I made this big long rant over at my all games blog over at community.allgames.com about how kind of sad it is just to see that the arcades are kind of

345
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Really giving way to the ticket spitters.

346
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:28,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And although Sunnyvale Golf Line did have some pretty cool music games, they had, you know, Beatmania 2DX Happy Sky, which I got to play, and they had Poppin' Music 8, which was cool, and they had some nice racing games.

347
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:31,268
[SPEAKER_05]: They had, like, everything in the little niche genres they had.

348
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:36,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it was kind of sad to see that most of the arcade has turned into that whole gambling for kids thing.

349
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So it kind of got me thinking, what do you think it would take...

350
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,032
[SPEAKER_05]: for us to really go back to arcades now?

351
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:50,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, a lot of folks say that arcades are dying because you can get the same experience at home and you can get a lot of them on Xbox Live.

352
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:53,116
[SPEAKER_05]: What do arcades need to do business again?

353
00:19:54,356 --> 00:20:02,919
[SPEAKER_06]: New games and well-maintained games and just something... Because even still, you can play DDR at home, but it's not the same as playing in the arcade.

354
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:06,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, just you need the atmosphere back.

355
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much it.

356
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:07,801
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to...

357
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:09,255
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

358
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:39,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave and Busters.

359
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave and Busters is kind of like that for adults.

360
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:46,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, do you really play a lot of the arcade games, Dave and Busters?

361
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:51,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a few, but a lot of us kind of succumb to the whole ticket spitting thing at Dave and Busters because we're drunk.

362
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

363
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:58,696
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I usually go off and, you know, when they had the, what was the, Mecha Assault?

364
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:05,137
[SPEAKER_03]: When they had that there, I know that that was always what, you know, whenever I'd go with Dan and the guys, that's what they went right for.

365
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:07,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd always play my Deluxe games, you know.

366
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,478
[SPEAKER_05]: But they got rid of Mecha Assault.

367
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:09,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid fuckers.

368
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:14,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really angry at the ticket spitters necessarily.

369
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:22,052
[SPEAKER_05]: It's disappointing to see, but if that's where the money is, I mean, it's not like I'm totally mad at Golfman because if that's where the money is, that's what they're going to buy, right?

370
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:26,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, those ticket spitters probably make them a ton of money, but...

371
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:31,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to think about what's really been new in the arcade lately that I've had to get excited about.

372
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:33,259
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Supernova?

373
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:39,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sorry, Bomani fans, but DDR Supernova was pretty much just a DDR 9th mix.

374
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,746
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't bring a whole lot of new stuff to the table, really.

375
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,988
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just kind of the same game all over again.

376
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:50,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And even you could say the games like In the Groove and stuff that tried to fill in the gaps, same thing.

377
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:51,614
[SPEAKER_05]: It was four panel dancing.

378
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:52,875
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the same damn game you always knew.

379
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But even DDR alone was not going to save an arcade.

380
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:56,460
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

381
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,000
[SPEAKER_05]: There hasn't been a lot of new stuff in general.

382
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the last big new arcade release I can think of was Soul Calibur 3, but that was already on the home consoles.

383
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:06,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

384
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:10,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like they're really starting to just kind of go away from making arcade games.

385
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:11,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of sad.

386
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:15,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if it weren't for that arcade community, this show would not exist.

387
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:16,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

388
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:17,943
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more Planet Harrier.

389
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:20,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's going to save it.

390
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:21,384
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

391
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:22,784
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

392
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:24,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, I'm trying to go to the chat room.

393
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:31,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com See, I had all games on the brain because of our little discussion with Bobby.

394
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:32,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go to that chat room.

395
00:22:32,908 --> 00:22:33,488
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the wrong one.

396
00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:36,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com And let's see.

397
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:39,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to see what kind of chat's going on here.

398
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:44,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Fireboma says the arcade by me is just having games that are more like rides now.

399
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those can be okay though.

400
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:50,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Like remember After Burner with the freaking thing that you would sit in that would practically make you sick?

401
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,692
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.

402
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:55,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

403
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:57,835
[SPEAKER_05]: NM64 says, Arcade Halo.

404
00:22:58,175 --> 00:22:59,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, that would probably bring him back.

405
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,636
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I kind of tend to agree.

406
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:02,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

407
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:03,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcade Half-Life.

408
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:04,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have that?

409
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:04,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

410
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:06,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember the grid?

411
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:07,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of like that.

412
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:09,739
[SPEAKER_06]: They have Half-Life in Japan where you can play that in the arcade.

413
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:10,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

414
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:10,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Multiplayer.

415
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:13,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I think about a game we saw at E3 a couple years ago.

416
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:19,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember if it was 04 or 05, but Andamiro of all companies was showing off this arcade game that would actually interface with computer versions of the game.

417
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a first-person shooter.

418
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:21,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

419
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:22,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

420
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:30,641
[SPEAKER_05]: OL Army recruit, I'm sorry, James Patrick says Virtua Fighter 5 should come to US arcades.

421
00:23:32,822 --> 00:23:33,543
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be interesting.

422
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:43,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so I don't know if there's an easy answer to how arcades can be kind of fun again for all of us, not just, you know, kids 8 through 12 or whatever.

423
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:45,091
[SPEAKER_05]: We welcome your feedback.

424
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:52,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Mail back at orangelaunchradio.com or you can head over to my blog, bloggy blog over at the community.allgames site and leave a comment.

425
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,057
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

426
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:57,751
[SPEAKER_05]: and I just want to say thanks to Bobby for hanging out with us yesterday and you should check out his show.

427
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:04,536
[SPEAKER_05]: He's on AllGames.com at 5 o'clock Pacific Time, about an hour before we go live over here at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

428
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:05,717
[SPEAKER_05]: He also does a podcast.

429
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:10,740
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different show over there because it's just him and his chat room and his callers.

430
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you know, the chat and the callers really drive that show.

431
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:20,868
[SPEAKER_05]: But Bobby's a really good moderator and he actually moderated a panel at GDC that Loki and I listened to on the car ride home.

432
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:21,368
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty good.

433
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:22,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

434
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:27,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And I forgot to mention, I played a lot of games over at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

435
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki playing Poppin' Music was fucking hilarious.

436
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:36,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Poppin' Music, but I had like $10 in tokens and I needed to get rid of them.

437
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:38,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was too tired to play DDR.

438
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet I did play more of it.

439
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:44,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So I played Poppin' 8, and I suck at Poppin' Music.

440
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:48,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised, because I knew I sucked at Poppin' Music.

441
00:24:48,944 --> 00:24:50,826
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just I really sucked at Poppin' Music.

442
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:52,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the Star Trek theme, and that sucked.

443
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,522
[SPEAKER_06]: and I played some random song and that really sucked.

444
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:00,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I played 2DX, Happy Sky, and I sucked at that and that was fun.

445
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:06,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played Supernova and Supernova was pretty good until I picked a random double song that was like a kata or something.

446
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:09,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I was too tired to play it.

447
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:11,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I played part of it though.

448
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:11,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

449
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:13,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just getting too out of shape for this.

450
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm out of practice.

451
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:20,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf is actually in chat right now and says Sky might have taken video on his phone.

452
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:21,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually didn't.

453
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I did take a picture though.

454
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:25,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put that on the community site later of Loki playing poppin' music.

455
00:25:25,645 --> 00:25:26,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

456
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:27,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

457
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:33,030
[SPEAKER_05]: James Patrick's continuing on the Virtua Fighter 5 thing.

458
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,313
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great knowing you could fight anyone in Japan or America who's using the Virtua Fighter 5 arcade.

459
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:42,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of going with that whole thing about maybe being able to interface with computers and stuff.

460
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:43,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.

461
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:44,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

462
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:48,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Illusion says that Pachinko machines could revitalize arcades.

463
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:50,122
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an interesting thought.

464
00:25:52,063 --> 00:25:54,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so anyway, we had fun at the arcade the other day.

465
00:25:55,125 --> 00:26:02,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But going back to Game Developers Conference and starting off tonight's news, I want to talk about, of course, huge news in the Sony department.

466
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:07,834
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, this news is like so big, we might actually want to take calls on this, just this, a little later.

467
00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:11,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony unveiled this week at the Game Developers Conference.

468
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:12,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very interesting news.

469
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:21,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll talk about Nintendo's conference in Part B, but a lot of the stuff that you saw the big companies do was really about the game development.

470
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:26,448
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't turn Game Developers Conference into E3 like a lot of people thought, which is a good thing, I think.

471
00:26:26,488 --> 00:26:27,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Game developers need their hangout.

472
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:29,510
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not E3.

473
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,935
[SPEAKER_05]: But Sony kind of used their keynote to drop E3-like bombs at, but they're kind of in a position where they need to, right?

474
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:38,936
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting the bad press right now.

475
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:43,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody kind of gives them a buy to use Game Developers Conference as their platform.

476
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,897
[SPEAKER_05]: And some would say they hit a home run.

477
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:47,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

478
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:49,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Key word there is home.

479
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,300
[SPEAKER_05]: They revealed PlayStation Home.

480
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we talked about it last week.

481
00:26:53,361 --> 00:27:00,804
[SPEAKER_05]: But even when we talked about it last week, and the whole Kotaku drama that resulted, I don't think I was expecting anything like this.

482
00:27:01,405 --> 00:27:02,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think any of us were.

483
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:05,867
[SPEAKER_05]: When I heard it was going to be like Animal Crossing, I'm picturing to myself...

484
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:07,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

485
00:27:30,826 --> 00:27:33,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could look at your virtual trophy rack.

486
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:39,129
[SPEAKER_05]: They've basically taken Microsoft's achievement system and kind of evolved it into, hey, you could get trophies that you put in your house.

487
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:39,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at my stuff.

488
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, come over and look at my stuff.

489
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,631
[SPEAKER_05]: But not just that.

490
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:44,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say you want to put a TV in your apartment.

491
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:48,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you can run videos on your TV from your PlayStation.

492
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:51,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Put pictures up on the wall that you have on your PlayStation Drive.

493
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:56,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk up to a pool table that you put down in your place and actually start playing pool.

494
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:58,316
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have some games included with this.

495
00:27:58,817 --> 00:27:59,857
[SPEAKER_05]: All of it, free.

496
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:10,726
[SPEAKER_05]: That's basically what they're saying is what Microsoft is giving you in Xbox Live, we are now going to give you this service called PlayStation Home, and it's free.

497
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:28,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the money that they're going to make, advertising on all the billboards throughout the place, and people love to customize, so unless you want the raggy, cheap IKEA furniture in your apartment, if you want some of the nice bling couches and stuff, you're going to have to probably pay for those, and people will probably do it.

498
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:31,789
[SPEAKER_06]: People will do that because they buy shit in Second Life.

499
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:39,350
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so this will all roll out in a closed beta of about 15,000 users between April and August.

500
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:48,232
[SPEAKER_05]: The open beta, about 50,000 users, August through October, and the service will go live with everybody probably about October.

501
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:55,254
[SPEAKER_06]: The best part about those, they're saying different games, kind of like how they have with the gamer picks and the games that you play on Xbox 360 right now.

502
00:28:56,852 --> 00:28:57,172
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

503
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:22,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Create your own levels.

504
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:23,619
[SPEAKER_06]: The entire thing's physics-based.

505
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of similar to, like, Gary's mod in Half-Life 2.

506
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:35,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And you create these little, almost like platformer levels that you and your friends will play and try to find their way through.

507
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:37,790
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's totally customizable.

508
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,573
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be able to download them, rate them, and so on and so forth.

509
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:44,556
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just, it looks like a lot of fun.

510
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually selling a lot of people on the whole...

511
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:50,352
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 Experience

512
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:23,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely the types of things that Sony is going to need.

513
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:28,016
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like, I think we've all been waiting for something like this out of Sony.

514
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:33,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you guys, but this is definitely, this put the brakes on the negative Sony press bandwagon.

515
00:30:33,902 --> 00:30:36,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I think Sony's turned around in another direction.

516
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:38,067
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say the question is how much.

517
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:40,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard people say everything from, eh.

518
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:44,824
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, to I'm going to go out and buy a PlayStation 3 now.

519
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:45,984
[SPEAKER_05]: This is exactly what I need.

520
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious kind of what you guys think.

521
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,545
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are PlayStation 3 owners.

522
00:30:50,545 --> 00:30:51,606
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this news?

523
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's awesome because their current service sucks.

524
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:59,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, their PlayStation – By the way, everyone wants to know, is Black Wolf still your only friend?

525
00:30:59,488 --> 00:30:59,928
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's not.

526
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:16,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have about seven now, so thank you for those people that sent requests, that's awesome, but it's just, you know, it's basically you don't, with the whole friend request system, you don't really know who's on there unless you actually talk to people and stuff, so, but yes, thank you, I have more than one friend now, so that's awesome.

527
00:31:16,312 --> 00:31:29,715
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, so the surface, since I already own a PlayStation 3, you know, I personally probably wouldn't buy a PlayStation 3 for just this stuff, but it's definitely helping it, you know, it's

528
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,691
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes their service look a bit nicer.

529
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:33,391
[SPEAKER_06]: It fleshes it out.

530
00:31:33,411 --> 00:31:36,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Because before, their network service was like, well, fuck, we don't know what they're doing.

531
00:31:36,974 --> 00:31:39,816
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be honest, right now, as of right now, they haven't done anything.

532
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:43,379
[SPEAKER_06]: So this home service is going to be pretty awesome.

533
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:48,542
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a way to actually meet people and to be able to add more friends that way.

534
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And just a really cool community thing.

535
00:31:50,924 --> 00:31:53,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's going to have the same appeal as, like, Second Life or Sims.

536
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:55,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, people are going to be customizing their own.

537
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,269
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to see, like, you know,

538
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:04,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Home places that are going to be themed around your websites and, you know, it's going to be crazy.

539
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:06,830
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have people reporting from home.

540
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, any thoughts on this?

541
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:14,692
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have my space in LiveJournal for getting in touch with people.

542
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:19,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all I would do is just sit around and mess with stuff in it like I do with The Sims.

543
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate Second Life, by the way.

544
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:24,774
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wouldn't be any...

545
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:28,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't make or break it for me, but since I already have it, I would use it.

546
00:32:29,896 --> 00:32:30,457
[SPEAKER_03]: That type of thing.

547
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:38,024
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, I don't own a PlayStation 3, and I've actually had several people ask me, is this going to make you go buy a PlayStation 3?

548
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:39,285
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

549
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:40,686
[SPEAKER_05]: But it helps.

550
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,949
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, what is the golden rule of gaming, boys and girls?

551
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,012
[SPEAKER_05]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

552
00:32:47,652 --> 00:32:51,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, this is a huge step in the right direction, because I love that

553
00:32:52,497 --> 00:33:07,467
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they've kind of done something... You know, come to think of it, I think we had a caller last week or the week before, and I'm so sorry to the caller, because I can't remember who called in and said this, but somebody called in and said, Sony is really good at ripping everybody else off and doing it a little better.

554
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:10,969
[SPEAKER_06]: That was actually on a podcast that we listened to in the car.

555
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:17,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody else said that, but when I heard that on the podcast listening to the car, I remember somebody calling in and saying it as well.

556
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:19,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought to myself...

557
00:33:21,204 --> 00:33:25,206
[SPEAKER_05]: When we took the call on air, I was kind of like, oh yeah, okay, yeah, that's a cute thing to look at.

558
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:28,747
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was kind of thinking when I saw this, I was like, god damn, they're right.

559
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:32,189
[SPEAKER_05]: That person, whoever called us, stand up and take a bow, whoever did that.

560
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was absolutely right.

561
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you think about it, we all thought Microsoft's Achievement Point system was genius.

562
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:40,752
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

563
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:41,412
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wonderful.

564
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:48,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we look at what PlayStation 3 is doing and we go, hmm, the Microsoft thing kind of seems kind of not as good as it could be now next to that.

565
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:51,734
[SPEAKER_03]: They just have the problem of being there first.

566
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:53,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess so.

567
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:55,256
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just interesting.

568
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:57,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I still like achievements.

569
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:06,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I still love 360 and so on and so forth, but it's just kind of interesting that Sony could still do that, even with all this negative press, kind of make a stop and go, wow, they really kind of did rip something off and make it better.

570
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:13,427
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing to keep in mind is that as we progress, as more and more and more ideas come out,

571
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:18,484
[SPEAKER_03]: After a while, it's very hard to innovate once you've already thought of what you can do.

572
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,906
[SPEAKER_03]: The only other thing you can do is expand on the idea.

573
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:26,109
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like we've never seen Nintendo doing this because they can't embrace online.

574
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:28,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

575
00:34:30,452 --> 00:34:40,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm still thinking I will probably end up breaking down and buying a PlayStation 3 when some of the games I want come out like Final Fantasy XIII and the Versus and everything.

576
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:42,435
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 this year is so critical

577
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:10,180
[SPEAKER_05]: because I think they need to make up for zonking out last year.

578
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this year at E3, now that they've kind of set the stage, because that's kind of what they do with the game developers,

579
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:26,956
[SPEAKER_05]: is they've kind of set the stage, everything around, the big case that PlayStation 3 is going to, you know, the big central thing now that PlayStation 3 is going to have, it's going to be about the games.

580
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:36,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony needs to come out at E3 and says, here's the exclusives, here's the first party stuff we're developing, here's the stuff that's going to really make you want a PlayStation 3 now.

581
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think about like all these trailers and things we saw at,

582
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:43,207
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 last year that we really have never heard about again ever since.

583
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:44,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe little bits and pieces here and there.

584
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:50,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Africa with a K. Can we find out why I need Africa and why this game is going to be so flipping great?

585
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:51,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we find that out this year?

586
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:54,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when we saw the trailer for it, we were like, I don't get it.

587
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:56,569
[SPEAKER_05]: What about that game?

588
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even remember what the hell the name of it was.

589
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:03,010
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember the trailer showed like the gas station blowing up or something in the cars.

590
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,110
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that with the two guys?

591
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:05,970
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked kind of neat.

592
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

593
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:07,551
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell was that?

594
00:36:07,571 --> 00:36:08,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's coming out.

595
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:09,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did it go?

596
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:17,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of curious, has your guys' opinion of Sony changed at all from the home run they hit at Game Developers Conference?

597
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:17,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

598
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,161
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about time that they did something right.

599
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:40,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's great.

600
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:45,405
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, originally when I heard about Home, I thought it was going to be a rip-off of The Me's.

601
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, not at all.

602
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:48,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's a rip-off of Second Life.

603
00:36:48,628 --> 00:36:53,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if you're going to at least take a business model, at least they took the right one.

604
00:36:54,372 --> 00:36:59,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Second Life is really successful as far as people making money off of it.

605
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:04,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, as soon as I saw, oh yeah, you're going to be able to buy clothing and stuff like that...

606
00:37:05,954 --> 00:37:08,255
[SPEAKER_06]: on the service and actually customize your characters.

607
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:10,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, well, cha-ching, you know.

608
00:37:11,156 --> 00:37:13,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they're going to make a lot of money.

609
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:22,680
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think it's great, and I do like the way that you can kind of jump in and play multiplayer games just by kind of meeting people and stuff, so that's kind of cool.

610
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:25,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

611
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:27,022
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of wait to see what they do with it.

612
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:32,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they've been talking, like, a lot of online communities and stuff, you know, with their games that are coming out.

613
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,304
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to be kind of...

614
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:35,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting to see how they implement everything.

615
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:50,570
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to open up our Skype line in a rare occurrence here just to get your feedback on this component because I think this is so big, and especially with all the whining and just kicking of Sony while they're down, people have been doing.

616
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:55,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really curious to see what our listeners think about this whole thing going in the other direction.

617
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,774
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to take some real quick calls.

618
00:37:57,076 --> 00:37:58,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that, though, I want to get some chat comments.

619
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:05,465
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, and then I want to hear what Jamie has to say on this as well, if anything.

620
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:07,447
[SPEAKER_05]: First, let me get some chat comments here.

621
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:09,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

622
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I was saying that somebody here said something really good up above.

623
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:14,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

624
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Live radio, scrolling around.

625
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:19,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the Rob.

626
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:19,479
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

627
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,440
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rob D. said,

628
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:21,894
[SPEAKER_05]: This doesn't matter to me.

629
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:22,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I need games.

630
00:38:23,055 --> 00:38:24,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a Trojan Horse Media Center.

631
00:38:24,856 --> 00:38:25,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me games.

632
00:38:26,357 --> 00:38:27,358
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be a good bonus.

633
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:29,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

634
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:35,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Illusion says, yeah, a new Sims game comes out and someone says, I like the Sims better when it was called PlayStation Home.

635
00:38:35,265 --> 00:38:38,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I think kind of making a joke about how Sony kind of rips things off and does it better.

636
00:38:39,428 --> 00:38:39,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

637
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:46,694
[SPEAKER_05]: James Patrick says, all PlayStation 3 only games are shallow and suck except for Resistance even now.

638
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:50,935
[SPEAKER_05]: and Zappy, I believe, saved the day there earlier in chat.

639
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Zappy believes that the game I was talking about was called Eight Days.

640
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:55,056
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds right.

641
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:56,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That does sound right to me as well.

642
00:38:57,797 --> 00:39:00,998
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, do you have anything you want to say about the whole Sony?

643
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:04,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Has your opinion of them changed, or you still think they're eating crayons over there, or what?

644
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:08,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think they're eating crayons, but this is a step away from the crayons.

645
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they've moved away from crayons to like, you know... Paste.

646
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:12,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Paste.

647
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,522
[SPEAKER_05]: because paste at least is, you know, flour-based.

648
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:18,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, organic a little bit.

649
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:25,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're eating paste in those little, you know, star-shaped, you know, string cheese nuggets.

650
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:26,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Lovely.

651
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:29,069
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go to the Skype line and see what people think on this.

652
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:30,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

653
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:31,991
[SPEAKER_05]: You scared me.

654
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:33,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven Stolfen.

655
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:33,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo.

656
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:34,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Raven Stolfen.

657
00:39:34,732 --> 00:39:36,574
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about Sony at GDC?

658
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:39,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely a step into the right direction.

659
00:39:39,956 --> 00:39:41,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a PlayStation 3 owner currently?

660
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:42,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish.

661
00:39:43,178 --> 00:39:43,418
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

662
00:39:43,438 --> 00:39:43,478
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

663
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:45,384
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've been wishing.

664
00:39:45,444 --> 00:39:45,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

665
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought home was a very good idea.

666
00:39:47,145 --> 00:39:50,207
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I want to do is just stream porn from my hard drive to my TV.

667
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:11,891
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can kind of do that anyway.

668
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:14,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know about the hard drive on your computer.

669
00:40:14,272 --> 00:40:19,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can stream the movies on your TV, but I'm looking at some FAQs that came out about it.

670
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:25,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the questions that was posed about PlayStation Home, can I launch and watch a BD movie from within home?

671
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:26,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Launch, yes.

672
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:27,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch, no.

673
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:33,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think some people were thinking that you'd be able to put like a porno on the TV in your apartment and that would play.

674
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:38,482
[SPEAKER_05]: You could go to that and launch the movie, but it won't actually play the porno in your apartment.

675
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:39,883
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's the impression I'm getting.

676
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:44,907
[SPEAKER_05]: The logistics of that seems like it would be a real bandwidth eater anyway, so it's probably for the best, right?

677
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:45,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I got bandwidth.

678
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:58,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it will actually stream whatever it is on that TV because they said they had dynamic sound or something like that where as you walk closer to the source it will get louder and that kind of thing.

679
00:41:01,303 --> 00:41:03,705
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think should be Sony's next move, RavensDolphin?

680
00:41:03,725 --> 00:41:04,786
[SPEAKER_05]: What should they do at E3?

681
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:07,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

682
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:14,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they should definitely put home in a good response, but I definitely agree that they need games to support the home.

683
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:17,360
[SPEAKER_04]: More games to support home would be a home run.

684
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:20,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe some games that incorporate the home thing into it.

685
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:27,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Because one thing that's interesting about what Sony is doing versus what Microsoft is doing is Microsoft requires developers to put achievements in the games.

686
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:32,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony is just kind of letting it be there, and if developers want to have things in it, then great.

687
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:43,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, when you beat Final Fantasy XIII, let's say, if Square wants to give you a little cloud sword, even though cloud's not in Final Fantasy XIII, I don't know, humor me here for a minute.

688
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:56,219
[SPEAKER_05]: A little cloud sword that you could put in your Playstation home That would be up to them, completely So, kind of interesting Yeah, two more things Alright, hurry First, voice chat You have to buy a Bluetooth headset and a USB Are you?

689
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:09,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I already have one for my 360 So it's going to be a tough sell on Sony Sony will need to tell me why I need it Okay, and the next thing about the trophies Did you see that room?

690
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:18,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw some of the videos, I did see, yeah, it looked like one room had a crap load of trophies, but maybe from all the arcade titles, I don't know.

691
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:22,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing from Second Life, so am I going to launch pink dicks at people that I don't like?

692
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:27,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling since this community is going to be a little more moderated, probably not.

693
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:30,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think, with Second Life you can kind of user create things, right?

694
00:42:30,846 --> 00:42:33,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't done a lot of Second Life, but there's more user creation in that, right?

695
00:42:34,087 --> 00:42:35,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you really get that so much here.

696
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,428
[SPEAKER_05]: You get user customization, but not so much creation.

697
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,560
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thanks so much for the call, Raven Stolfen.

698
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:42,601
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome, Bob.

699
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:43,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

700
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:46,562
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll take one more call and some feedback with the Sony stuff.

[SPEAKER_05]: You're liking it a lot?

714
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:19,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you somebody that wanted a PlayStation 3 before Game Developers Conference?

715
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually know originally I was split between a 360 and a PS3.

716
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:28,931
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think now?

717
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:32,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now I've got to start thinking about...

718
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:48,125
[SPEAKER_08]: The PS3 now, so I'm still, before I was like, you know, like majority 360, now, you know, I'm like back in the middle, so I'm gonna wait until, you know, this home thing picks up around October and then, you know, I'll make a decision.

719
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:51,366
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it about home that puts you back in the middle with all this?

720
00:43:52,766 --> 00:44:03,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, originally, you know, I used to play The Sims a lot, you know, that was like basically my, like, guilty pleasure, that thing was like crack, so this is kind of like The Sims, so, you know,

721
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:11,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'm going to be on this thing customizing buying crap to make my place look good.

722
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:15,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of customizing LittleBigPlanet, is that something that appeals to you?

723
00:44:16,661 --> 00:44:17,461
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks really nice.

724
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:29,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it will be great because I think they said something that they're going to come out with a full version where it's just going to basically be user-created...

725
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:32,400
[SPEAKER_08]: and many, many, many more.

726
00:45:00,728 --> 00:45:02,349
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

727
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:45,733
[SPEAKER_03]: and he walks around with you and he growls when he smells the people sneaking up on you and you can't really tell him what to do but you can gesture to him and he'll learn to follow, well he'll always follow you but he'll go along with you and be your puppy and lick your face and eat your chickens and that type of thing.

728
00:45:45,753 --> 00:45:46,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, he'll eat your chickens?

729
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:47,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not good.

730
00:45:49,474 --> 00:45:51,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the chickens fight back like they did in Zelda?

731
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:53,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

732
00:45:54,094 --> 00:45:57,635
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wish they had cats.

733
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:01,774
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of disappointing, because I'm more of a cat person.

734
00:46:01,914 --> 00:46:04,034
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I suppose the cat would control you.

735
00:46:04,755 --> 00:46:11,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently you can also be a pregnant woman and catch diseases.

736
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:14,317
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get knocked up within Fable 2.

737
00:46:14,778 --> 00:46:15,698
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have sex.

738
00:46:15,798 --> 00:46:18,019
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have unprotected sex and protected sex.

739
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:19,239
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get STDs.

740
00:46:21,357 --> 00:46:23,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking the fantasy out of my game.

741
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:26,378
[SPEAKER_05]: How many different kinds of sex can you have?

742
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:29,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there going to be a whole Kama Sutra?

743
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:30,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Will butt sex be involved?

744
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.

745
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,521
[SPEAKER_05]: They had gay relationships in the first game.

746
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:36,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Butt sex is not just a gay thing.

747
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:37,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's true.

748
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:38,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

749
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:41,442
[SPEAKER_06]: But the dog, though, is pretty awesome, though.

750
00:46:41,462 --> 00:46:51,304
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying that you're actually going to care for this dog, and it loves you, and it will try to keep you safe and stuff like that.

751
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pretty cool.

752
00:46:52,305 --> 00:47:01,827
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some videos on GameVideos.com, basically talking about the whole dog aspect of the game, and it just looks awesome.

753
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:02,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want it.

754
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,948
[SPEAKER_06]: It's way better than Nintendogs.

755
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,200
[SPEAKER_05]: and M64.

756
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

757
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:11,023
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Dollar Bill says, I want to have sex without e-herpes.

758
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:12,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see.

759
00:47:12,503 --> 00:47:14,464
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Dollar Bill says, surprise butt sex.

760
00:47:15,705 --> 00:47:18,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's something you could do in the game is, you know, surprise butt sex on people.

761
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:19,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

762
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:20,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

763
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:21,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know.

764
00:47:21,788 --> 00:47:26,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I were going to have something useful, I'd have like a pet, you know, wolf.

765
00:47:26,983 --> 00:47:30,104
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Mad says, do we get extra points for donkey punching?

766
00:47:30,385 --> 00:47:31,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a pitbull.

767
00:47:31,605 --> 00:47:34,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And NM64 says, everyone has AIDS.

768
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:39,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you're allowed to run around and have unprotected sex in the game, that's the likely conclusion.

769
00:47:39,228 --> 00:47:42,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you could start like an epidemic in-game.

770
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird.

771
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:48,392
[SPEAKER_05]: But I suppose this answers the question now about what was the big secret about Fable.

772
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:50,874
[SPEAKER_01]: It's puppy dogs and diseases.

773
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:51,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

774
00:47:51,754 --> 00:47:52,214
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it.

775
00:47:52,654 --> 00:47:56,296
[SPEAKER_05]: DDRDollarBill says, you're going to have to buy your condoms with your MS points.

776
00:47:59,056 --> 00:47:59,576
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.

777
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:02,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Little microtransactions out the wazoo.

778
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:05,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe you'll be able to get a cat, but you'll have to pay some points for it.

779
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:05,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

780
00:48:06,522 --> 00:48:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

781
00:48:08,463 --> 00:48:11,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there were... You have to change the litter or you die of methane poisoning.

782
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:16,529
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some other announcements that came out of Game Developers Conference, and I love me some Mizuguchi.

783
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:21,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Mizuguchi, the fine fellow who created Rez.

784
00:48:22,093 --> 00:48:23,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Space Channel 5.

785
00:48:23,974 --> 00:48:24,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Luminous...

786
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:30,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Meteos, some of the great escapes 99 Nights, not so much feeling the love there

787
00:48:30,936 --> 00:49:00,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But everybody's allowed to make a mistake Well, make no mistake here, every Xtend Extra Extreme is coming to Xbox Live Arcade And it looks like the audio and visual sexcapade that you would be expecting from Mizuguchi I mean, just kind of look at these screenshots here Of course, every Xtend Extra was a game that was out on the PSP They're going to be making this version as well for Xbox Live Arcade And of course they're calling it E4 for short Because every Xtend Extra Extreme, get it, there's all the E's there

788
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:01,624
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

789
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it has puzzle elements.

790
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,761
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to think about what you're doing.

791
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:26,021
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is kind of an action game.

792
00:49:26,082 --> 00:49:27,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's unique.

793
00:49:27,763 --> 00:49:29,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm a big supporter of unique games.

794
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:32,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was a perfect announcement for Game Developers Conference.

795
00:49:32,165 --> 00:49:36,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out on Xbox Live Marketplace when it becomes available.

796
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:37,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably later this year.

797
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:39,810
[SPEAKER_05]: At least as far as we know.

798
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, late, late this year.

799
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:42,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas.

800
00:49:42,592 --> 00:49:42,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas.

801
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:46,555
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

802
00:50:06,155 --> 00:50:06,615
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

803
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:30,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I had thought that Microsoft already confirmed this, so I was kind of surprised to see this making the rounds on news sites again.

804
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they sort of confirmed it, and then they made a press release about it, so now it's official, official, I guess.

805
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,222
[SPEAKER_05]: These stages of gaming news, especially Microsoft gaming news, because Microsoft news always starts out as a rumor first, because Microsoft rumors...

806
00:50:43,982 --> 00:50:45,183
[SPEAKER_05]: 99% of the time are true.

807
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:54,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a Microsoft rumor and then it evolves into random dude at Microsoft or a Microsoft blogger said, yeah, we're working on it, shh, don't tell.

808
00:50:54,627 --> 00:50:56,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it evolves into like a press release.

809
00:50:56,808 --> 00:50:58,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's like, oh, it's official now.

810
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:02,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft has said, hail the larger Xbox Live arcade games.

811
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure every X10 Extra will benefit from that 150 megs.

812
00:51:07,252 --> 00:51:08,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the other thing I want to know, though.

813
00:51:09,513 --> 00:51:11,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that the arcade limit has been upped

814
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:13,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Mizuguchi and everybody over at Q Entertainment.

815
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:20,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened, it's been like a year now, whatever happened to Madonna and Luminous?

816
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not just saying Madonna specifically.

817
00:51:23,253 --> 00:51:25,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Contrary to popular belief, I could give two shits about Madonna.

818
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:28,137
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm talking about the licensed music in general.

819
00:51:29,538 --> 00:51:32,741
[SPEAKER_05]: We got one song, Heavenly Star, which was an in-house thing anyway.

820
00:51:33,241 --> 00:51:35,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the rest of the content that's supposed to be in Luminous?

821
00:51:35,823 --> 00:51:36,604
[SPEAKER_06]: No content for you.

822
00:51:36,804 --> 00:51:37,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess not.

823
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:38,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I got on a tangent there.

824
00:51:38,986 --> 00:51:41,187
[SPEAKER_05]: This is supposed to be about the thing.

825
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:43,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about Mizuguchi made me think about that.

826
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:45,751
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell ever happened to Madonna, etc.?

827
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:46,712
[SPEAKER_03]: The puppy ate it.

828
00:51:47,673 --> 00:51:48,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

829
00:51:48,793 --> 00:51:49,454
[SPEAKER_05]: The dog ate it.

830
00:51:51,964 --> 00:51:56,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know something that you don't really have to worry about?

831
00:51:57,287 --> 00:51:57,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

832
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:58,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sort of worried about this.

833
00:51:59,568 --> 00:52:05,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Jackson is doing some episodic content for a couple of Xbox 360 games, and one of them is Halo.

834
00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:08,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering, dude, what's he going to do for Halo?

835
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,174
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be very interesting.

836
00:52:11,594 --> 00:52:15,056
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not too many details about it, and I don't think anything on what the other game is.

837
00:52:16,497 --> 00:52:19,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's still in development, but

838
00:52:20,723 --> 00:52:21,644
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

839
00:52:45,264 --> 00:52:50,227
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like episodic content has become this real buzzword of the past couple of years, hasn't it?

840
00:52:50,487 --> 00:52:52,548
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like everybody and their mom's doing episodic content.

841
00:52:54,229 --> 00:52:57,051
[SPEAKER_05]: What could they really do for Halo episodic content, you think?

842
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:01,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this is something they'll do like two and then say, oh, there was your episodic content?

843
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:03,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this something you could see actually going on for a while?

844
00:53:03,394 --> 00:53:05,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, God, if any community could support...

845
00:53:05,814 --> 00:53:12,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I would see this happening after Halo 3 and it would be for Halo 3, not its own game.

846
00:53:13,117 --> 00:53:18,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like additional story, single player stuff, or co-op missions or stuff like that.

847
00:53:18,339 --> 00:53:23,121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of similar to the co-op missions in Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter or something like that.

848
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:27,303
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really episodic content, it's just downloadable content later on.

849
00:53:27,763 --> 00:53:33,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, to be honest, there aren't that many episodic content games out there.

850
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:35,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even Half-Life or whatever...

851
00:53:35,686 --> 00:53:39,847
[SPEAKER_06]: They're only up to Episode 2, and 2 hasn't even come out yet.

852
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:41,407
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I'm going to say Sam & Max.

853
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam & Max, yeah, that's one that's actually pretty good.

854
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:46,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But what else besides that?

855
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:50,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, Sam & Max is like the only ones that seem to be doing it right.

856
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:54,471
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a buzzword thrown out there a lot, and it's not being done.

857
00:53:54,671 --> 00:53:58,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just like digital distribution for movies and stuff.

858
00:53:58,552 --> 00:54:00,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone talks about it, but it's hardly done.

859
00:54:00,677 --> 00:54:02,938
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta check in with the chatroom because there's some funnies.

860
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:12,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, going back to me bitching about the whole Luminous thing, Joshi16 kind of combined the stories together and says, Madonna would give you the herpes achievement, Sky.

861
00:54:12,405 --> 00:54:18,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So, insinuating that maybe Madonna will actually be in Fable to give you the STDs that you can get inside the game.

862
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's certainly an interesting thought from Joshi16.

863
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:25,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, Laser is a winner for this reference.

864
00:54:25,713 --> 00:54:27,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the dingo ate your content!

865
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:30,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Ahhhh!

866
00:54:31,775 --> 00:54:33,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm getting all Meryl Streep.

867
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:34,616
[SPEAKER_05]: The dingo ate the baby!

868
00:54:34,997 --> 00:54:36,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's see.

869
00:54:38,198 --> 00:54:39,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so winner for that comment.

870
00:54:40,459 --> 00:54:42,260
[SPEAKER_05]: What else was there about episodic content?

871
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was very interesting here in chat room.

872
00:54:44,822 --> 00:54:48,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Fire Safety says there are already giant monkeys in Halo.

873
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:51,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess you can't really say that that's what Peter Jackson is going to bring to the table.

874
00:54:53,866 --> 00:54:54,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

875
00:54:55,987 --> 00:55:00,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Fire Safety also says hopefully it's nothing like Half-Life 2 periodic yearly maybe content.

876
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:04,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Funnydale says episodic content equals three-hour games every year.

877
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:10,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, that's basically what it's been so far, so I'm hoping Halo will break that mold.

878
00:55:11,816 --> 00:55:12,176
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

879
00:55:13,217 --> 00:55:20,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is not a happy story here, but some news came out about Castle Crashers.

880
00:55:20,424 --> 00:55:24,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you were all excited about Castle Crashers, because this is the game that kind of looks like...

881
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:29,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like an old school arcade, like hit the buttons, hack and slash type thing.

882
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:30,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a brand new one.

883
00:55:30,734 --> 00:55:31,835
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks awesome.

884
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:40,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when approached, Behemoth's Dan Paladin, they won actually an IGF award.

885
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,062
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dan Paladin actually commented on the game.

886
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:47,665
[SPEAKER_05]: He noted that the Xbox Live title still had, quote, about a year of development left.

887
00:55:48,426 --> 00:55:51,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning the Castle Crashers looks like it'll now be out in 2008.

888
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:51,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

889
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:54,729
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

890
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to the size increase.

891
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:10,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe good things will come to those who wait in terms of what's there.

892
00:56:10,435 --> 00:56:13,137
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know you were really anxious about this game, Loki.

893
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:16,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you okay with this delay if it's going to make the game better?

894
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you pissed?

895
00:56:17,381 --> 00:56:19,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you wish they'd just released something now and maybe do a Castle Crashers 2?

896
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:20,524
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

897
00:56:20,824 --> 00:56:22,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm fine with them delaying the game.

898
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:27,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely, even if it wasn't because of this, it would be delayed for some other reason.

899
00:56:28,011 --> 00:56:29,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who cares?

900
00:56:29,272 --> 00:56:31,714
[SPEAKER_06]: There's supposedly more content coming out now, so...

901
00:56:32,677 --> 00:56:33,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine holding off on that.

902
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:35,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's one of those games that look neat.

903
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:37,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't like, oh, I've got to have this now.

904
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:40,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, big deal.

905
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

906
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:41,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I can wait.

907
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:43,181
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

908
00:56:43,741 --> 00:56:48,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know, but game delays, they kind of get me a little bit angsty.

909
00:56:48,162 --> 00:56:55,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but, you know, any time a game I look forward to gets delayed, whether it be for the right reason or not, I get a little pissed off.

910
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:55,585
[SPEAKER_05]: What about you?

911
00:56:56,578 --> 00:56:56,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes.

912
00:56:57,258 --> 00:57:01,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means that because we're pissed off, well, this is one of those times, DarkSakura.

913
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:02,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Help me out here because we've got a segue.

914
00:57:02,939 --> 00:57:03,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Roar!

915
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:04,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

916
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:05,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Into the FUs of the week.

917
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:20,582
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week is, as usual, traffic-based.

918
00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:24,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to men with small penises who drive big trucks.

919
00:57:25,253 --> 00:57:27,574
[SPEAKER_03]: and also fuck you to Sakura moms who drive SUVs.

920
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:29,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I leave it at that.

921
00:57:29,854 --> 00:57:30,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

922
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:37,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck the fact that I can't find two files for Pop Station for the PSP.

923
00:57:37,876 --> 00:57:40,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are two important files that I need to make things work.

924
00:57:40,877 --> 00:57:46,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I did find, however, though, there is one game that I have that I really should put on my PSP and that is Einhander.

925
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:48,339
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fucking awesome.

926
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,420
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

927
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:52,400
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

928
00:57:52,968 --> 00:58:00,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have really anything that... Oh, fuck to the fact that this room is like a scorching... I don't know, it's like a... I think somebody turned the fan off.

929
00:58:00,156 --> 00:58:01,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go check that thing.

930
00:58:01,297 --> 00:58:02,118
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like fucking hot in here.

931
00:58:02,138 --> 00:58:02,638
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

932
00:58:02,918 --> 00:58:03,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just me.

933
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,421
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know.

934
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:06,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm burning up here too.

935
00:58:06,262 --> 00:58:07,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go look at the temperature in a minute.

936
00:58:07,904 --> 00:58:12,248
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to say my FU of the week would go to Daylight Savings Time.

937
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:13,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

938
00:58:14,711 --> 00:58:16,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh, I hate Daylight Savings Time.

939
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:19,700
[SPEAKER_05]: How dare you rob me of an hour of my sleep.

940
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:23,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if there's farmer kids with school or whatever the hell reason they say.

941
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:27,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Energy consumption, whatever the hell excuse they have.

942
00:58:28,323 --> 00:58:29,903
[SPEAKER_05]: F you, Daylight Savings, time to go die in a fire.

943
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:32,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that was a pretty short FUs of the Week segment.

944
00:58:34,065 --> 00:58:35,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of sad a little bit.

945
00:58:36,565 --> 00:58:37,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, don't be sad.

946
00:58:39,086 --> 00:58:41,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, there's one reason you shouldn't be sad.

947
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:44,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live hit 6 million users.

948
00:58:44,921 --> 00:59:02,546
[SPEAKER_06]: They apparently did this four months earlier than they had expected and not a big surprise because, you know, they offer those two-day subscriptions and pretty much anyone that plugs in, you know, their console into the internet, they are logged into Xbox Live.

949
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:07,407
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and they didn't really say what the six million mark meant.

950
00:59:07,487 --> 00:59:12,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, whether that's going to be silver or gold or whatever, I don't know.

951
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:13,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

952
00:59:14,332 --> 00:59:15,052
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

953
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I have kind of noticed, what about Rayman Raving Rabbids on the 360?

954
00:59:37,477 --> 00:59:41,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm guessing that's going to be about as good as any iToy game.

955
00:59:41,318 --> 00:59:42,478
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a damn good point.

956
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:45,378
[SPEAKER_05]: When was the last time anyone said anything about the Xbox Live camera?

957
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And why is it we haven't gotten more games like Uno?

958
00:59:50,540 --> 01:00:02,462
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think, based on the success of Uno, that we would have seen like, you know, we would see like Old Maid and like freaking Skip Bow and I don't know, whatever else card games and casual games they can come up with on Xbox Live by now.

959
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:04,091
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

960
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:32,970
[SPEAKER_03]: As was announced at a Game Developers Conference.

961
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:33,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that cool?

962
01:00:34,912 --> 01:00:38,496
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking that I've actually been really excited about this, you know.

963
01:00:40,257 --> 01:00:45,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm still sort of back and forth, but we have to wait until August to get it.

964
01:00:45,663 --> 01:00:50,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think by then I'll decide whether or not I really am going to be able to dedicate the time to another RPG, but I think it's going to be awesome.

965
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:57,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there were a couple more details on Blue Dragon this week because I thought about Loki.

966
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:01,213
[SPEAKER_05]: You said already on this show like a month ago that Blue Dragon was coming out over here.

967
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:03,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you might have said July, but whatever.

968
01:01:03,516 --> 01:01:04,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It got delayed a couple weeks.

969
01:01:04,516 --> 01:01:05,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Big whoop, right?

970
01:01:05,617 --> 01:01:06,879
[SPEAKER_05]: But we all knew it was coming over here.

971
01:01:06,919 --> 01:01:14,826
[SPEAKER_05]: But I seem to remember one cool thing that I remember reading about Blue Dragon is that they're going to have both the English language and Japanese language tracks in it.

972
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:16,427
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

973
01:01:42,154 --> 01:01:48,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Joshi16 will not let the Madonna thing go because Joshi says Madonna needs a live arcade camera game.

974
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:51,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you need to get your issues worked out there with Madonna.

975
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:53,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what else do we have here?

976
01:01:54,004 --> 01:01:56,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Blaze says simply, fuck the Xbox Live camera.

977
01:01:57,227 --> 01:01:57,927
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it.

978
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:01,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Mori agrees Xbox 360 Skipbo would be amazing.

979
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,253
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what would be more amazing than Xbox 360 Skipbo?

980
01:02:04,293 --> 01:02:05,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And props to you if you know this game.

981
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:10,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I might be horribly pronouncing it because it's French, but this is like my favorite card game ever.

982
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:12,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360 Millborn.

983
01:02:13,534 --> 01:02:17,797
[SPEAKER_05]: You ever played that game with the roll and stop and punctured tires?

984
01:02:17,878 --> 01:02:19,158
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a racing card game.

985
01:02:19,439 --> 01:02:20,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it's the best game ever.

986
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that card game.

987
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:25,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring me my Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade.

988
01:02:26,624 --> 01:02:26,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

989
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:28,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ranty tonight.

990
01:02:29,386 --> 01:02:30,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a demanding little bitch tonight.

991
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:31,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

992
01:02:33,009 --> 01:02:33,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be good.

993
01:02:38,246 --> 01:02:40,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, we've got release dates to talk about.

994
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:42,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

995
01:02:42,569 --> 01:02:43,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Live radio.

996
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:47,013
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I get all ranty, and then I completely forget about talking about release dates.

997
01:02:47,413 --> 01:02:53,478
[SPEAKER_05]: But I suppose we should talk about the Japanese release dates, because these are usually the things that we're going to see over here in the U.S.

998
01:02:53,538 --> 01:02:55,779
[SPEAKER_05]: before too long, or over in Europe as well.

999
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, coming out on the Xbox 360, not a lot, except some games are going into the Platinum Collection on March 15th.

1000
01:03:03,365 --> 01:03:06,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can now get Battlefield 2, Burnout, Chromehounds, Perfect Dark Zero...

1001
01:03:07,259 --> 01:03:08,860
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the lower price over in Japan.

1002
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, you get GI Jockey Wii is coming out.

1003
01:03:14,263 --> 01:03:17,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic 2 Himitsu Ring is coming out on March 15th.

1004
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:19,986
[SPEAKER_05]: That would just be Sonic and the Secret Rings.

1005
01:03:21,206 --> 01:03:25,529
[SPEAKER_05]: SpongeBob SquarePants also making its way to Japanese audiences also on March 15th.

1006
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:26,649
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sorry, Japan.

1007
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:27,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Japan, for that.

1008
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes things from our culture will stink up your things.

1009
01:03:32,525 --> 01:03:38,687
[SPEAKER_05]: on the PlayStation 3 Fight Night Round 3 making its way to Japan on March 15th as well as a game called Dust Cap 3.

1010
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:45,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you, but I've never heard of Dust... Oh, it's... That's not a game.

1011
01:03:45,268 --> 01:03:45,828
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why.

1012
01:03:48,269 --> 01:03:48,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1013
01:03:48,889 --> 01:03:49,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I need help tonight.

1014
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:55,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Dust Cap 3 is just an accessory that's literally... Because I was like, whatever happened to Dust Cap 3?

1015
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what the hell is Dust Cap 1 and 2?

1016
01:03:57,511 --> 01:04:00,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like the name of some either weird RPG or puzzle game.

1017
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:03,232
[SPEAKER_05]: DustCap 1 and 2

1018
01:04:31,923 --> 01:04:34,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Princess Maker 4 is coming out.

1019
01:04:34,084 --> 01:04:39,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you've ever wanted to be your own princess, now you can for a much lower price because that's going into the best hits.

1020
01:04:39,706 --> 01:04:41,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's exactly what that's about.

1021
01:04:43,907 --> 01:04:45,728
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Princess Maker 4.

1022
01:04:45,808 --> 01:04:46,528
[SPEAKER_05]: How can it not be?

1023
01:04:46,848 --> 01:04:47,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the box art.

1024
01:04:48,229 --> 01:04:51,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't that look like princesses having a good time there?

1025
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:53,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, look at the description.

1026
01:04:53,389 --> 01:05:00,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Princess Maker 4 is the fourth installment of the popular promotion simulation game in which you become the father guardian of a young girl.

1027
01:05:00,373 --> 01:05:02,815
[SPEAKER_05]: You must raise her to become a princess in eight years.

1028
01:05:03,175 --> 01:05:03,435
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

1029
01:05:03,715 --> 01:05:04,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Princess Maker.

1030
01:05:05,076 --> 01:05:05,496
[SPEAKER_05]: That's lame.

1031
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:06,337
[SPEAKER_05]: STFU.

1032
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:07,477
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know what you're talking about.

1033
01:05:09,779 --> 01:05:10,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

1034
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:11,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I have more.

1035
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:15,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Dust Cap 4 is coming out in 2008.

1036
01:05:15,802 --> 01:05:16,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for it.

1037
01:05:16,863 --> 01:05:18,364
[SPEAKER_05]: No, on Nintendo DS real quick.

1038
01:05:18,975 --> 01:05:23,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Bionicle Heroes, the Konami Arcade Collection is coming out over there in Japan.

1039
01:05:24,737 --> 01:05:31,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Kuro Kuro Princess and Lost in Blue 2 is coming out on March 15th as well.

1040
01:05:32,419 --> 01:05:34,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And Fingerprint Guard Film Light.

1041
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:36,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

1042
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that one.

1043
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:37,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

1044
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew that wasn't a game.

1045
01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:41,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'm done.

1046
01:05:41,341 --> 01:05:41,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

1047
01:05:42,174 --> 01:05:48,839
[SPEAKER_06]: US, pretty much as far as games go, there's really one big one this week, and that would be God of War 2, coming out in PlayStation 2.

1048
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,961
[SPEAKER_06]: PSP's not seeing much else either.

1049
01:05:52,501 --> 01:05:57,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty 3, Road to Victory, that's going to be coming out as well this week.

1050
01:05:57,685 --> 01:06:06,671
[SPEAKER_06]: The 360, we're just getting a re-release of Call of Duty 3, the Gold Edition, now with downloadable maps actually included in there.

1051
01:06:06,691 --> 01:06:11,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you get tokens for that, and some special behind-the-scenes DVD or something.

1052
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:12,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame.

1053
01:06:13,275 --> 01:06:16,316
[SPEAKER_06]: For the PlayStation 3, you're getting College Hoops 2K7.

1054
01:06:16,936 --> 01:06:17,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray.

1055
01:06:18,077 --> 01:06:20,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see.

1056
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:24,039
[SPEAKER_06]: For PC, quite a bit of stuff coming out.

1057
01:06:24,499 --> 01:06:25,700
[SPEAKER_06]: None of it looks very good, though.

1058
01:06:27,501 --> 01:06:28,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Some highlights.

1059
01:06:28,821 --> 01:06:30,842
[SPEAKER_06]: The Top Spin 2 is coming to the PC.

1060
01:06:31,602 --> 01:06:33,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Battlefield 2 Complete.

1061
01:06:35,364 --> 01:06:36,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, the rest sucks.

1062
01:06:37,645 --> 01:06:39,726
[SPEAKER_06]: For the Wii, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07.

1063
01:06:40,856 --> 01:06:41,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your golf on.

1064
01:06:42,157 --> 01:06:50,284
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for the DS, you have Mind Quiz, and that's another ripoff of Brain Age.

1065
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:52,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I say another game I played this week real quick?

1066
01:06:53,607 --> 01:07:01,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Quiz and Dragons with Bobby Blackwolf, and we were so horrible at that game, words cannot describe it.

1067
01:07:02,236 --> 01:07:12,445
[SPEAKER_05]: The handicap we will need on future games of Quiz and Dragons, which is now on Altercade, apparently, even though Altercade, you know, we're a little meh, but yeah, Quiz and Dragons will own you.

1068
01:07:13,606 --> 01:07:22,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Herbie Rescue Rally DS, which is a port of a crappy movie made into a crappy game, now on the DS, and it looks crappy.

1069
01:07:23,795 --> 01:07:24,075
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

1070
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to say real quick.

1071
01:07:27,036 --> 01:07:28,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, chat.

1072
01:07:28,417 --> 01:07:28,697
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Rob.

1073
01:07:28,717 --> 01:07:29,177
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chat.

1074
01:07:29,197 --> 01:07:29,657
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chat.

1075
01:07:29,757 --> 01:07:29,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1076
01:07:30,258 --> 01:07:33,119
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room was making fun of my fuck up earlier.

1077
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:36,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tetsuya says, Dust Cap 3, Dust Cap's revenge.

1078
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:39,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Firebomb says, Dust Cap 3 gets more incredible.

1079
01:07:40,343 --> 01:07:44,205
[SPEAKER_05]: And Illusion makes the mandatory Dust Cap 3 electric boogaloo.

1080
01:07:44,585 --> 01:07:45,646
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be Dust Cap 2.

1081
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, how about our European releases?

1082
01:07:50,248 --> 01:07:50,749
[SPEAKER_05]: How about it?

1083
01:07:51,229 --> 01:07:52,249
[SPEAKER_03]: A Bunch of Crap on the 16th and...

1084
01:07:54,443 --> 01:07:55,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe some of it's kind of crap.

1085
01:07:55,644 --> 01:07:56,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it's kind of cool.

1086
01:07:56,685 --> 01:08:23,304
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Call of Duty 3, Championship Manager 2007, Free Running, Legend of the Dragon, Lunar Knights, Vampire Hunters, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Justice for All, Puzzle Quest, Challenge of the Warlords, Rayman, Raving Rabbids, Rome Total War, Saint Seiya, The Hades, Summer Warriors 2 Empires, Spectrobes, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on DS, Test Drive Unlimited, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07, and UFO Extraterrestrials.

1087
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:25,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Electronic Arts and Harmonics

1088
01:08:49,904 --> 01:09:02,813
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was just a real brief thing that came out, was leaked to the media this week that Electronic Arts announced they have penned a deal with MTV Networks and Harmonix to publish Harmonix's next game.

1089
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:06,135
[SPEAKER_05]: However, what that game is, is a secret for now.

1090
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:18,204
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's interesting though because, you know, obviously Guitar Hero was something that Red Octane published but now EA is going to be filling that role for whatever Harmonix's next game is.

1091
01:09:19,492 --> 01:09:29,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember previously said, and it looks like this article makes reference to it too, Harmonix once said that Guitar Hero is just the tip of the iceberg, just the beginning of what these games can become.

1092
01:09:29,555 --> 01:09:35,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And I seem to remember Harmonix saying that their next project was like way bigger than Guitar Hero, like a real thing.

1093
01:09:36,117 --> 01:09:39,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people speculate it's going to be a game that really teaches you how to play guitar.

1094
01:09:40,998 --> 01:09:41,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1095
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:43,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still waiting for Sax Maniacs.

1096
01:09:44,754 --> 01:09:53,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of wish they'd bring back the Amplitude thing in some new evolved regard, because I did love me some Amplitude.

1097
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:56,499
[SPEAKER_05]: They could evolve the game, make it next-gen somehow, a little more competitive.

1098
01:09:56,519 --> 01:09:58,080
[SPEAKER_05]: They need Kraken DJ over here.

1099
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:02,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Crackin' DJ was not even a Harmonix, that was a Sega game.

1100
01:10:02,062 --> 01:10:03,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care, it's still fun.

1101
01:10:03,744 --> 01:10:05,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Crackin' DJ, I haven't heard that in years.

1102
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:15,693
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least Crackin' DJ sort of made you feel like you were actually remixing stuff because you're going through the same motions an actual DJ would, so that was kind of neat.

1103
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:22,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will be kick-banning users in chatroom who said that the game Harmonix is making is Dust Cap 4.

1104
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:24,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the joke die, you assholes.

1105
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have the start of a brand new...

1106
01:10:28,323 --> 01:10:29,724
[SPEAKER_03]: A joke to beat into the ground.

1107
01:10:29,744 --> 01:10:31,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Dust Cap 4, bust a cap.

1108
01:10:31,805 --> 01:10:32,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that in there.

1109
01:10:32,606 --> 01:10:33,166
[SPEAKER_06]: That was funny.

1110
01:10:33,486 --> 01:10:35,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha.

1111
01:10:35,948 --> 01:10:39,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so more EA news, of course.

1112
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:47,094
[SPEAKER_06]: They are kicking off an online music competition featuring singing sensation Lily Allen.

1113
01:10:47,194 --> 01:10:48,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Who the fuck that is?

1114
01:10:48,795 --> 01:10:53,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not, you know, hip to these artists out there.

1115
01:10:53,538 --> 01:10:56,800
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, apparently Lily Allen, they're doing...

1116
01:10:58,109 --> 01:10:59,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess this is coinciding.

1117
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:00,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just put this in perspective for people.

1118
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:06,673
[SPEAKER_05]: If the music doesn't sound like pooch, pooch, mew, mew, mew, mew, pooch, pooch, mew, mew, mew, then Loki doesn't listen to it.

1119
01:11:06,753 --> 01:11:10,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, if it's not cat techno, it's not for me.

1120
01:11:11,196 --> 01:11:12,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyways.

1121
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:19,800
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but apparently she's doing a version of her song, Smile, for Sims 2.

1122
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,982
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be in Simlish, which makes it sound even more retarded.

1123
01:11:25,022 --> 01:11:26,823
[SPEAKER_06]: So, very excellent.

1124
01:11:28,646 --> 01:11:37,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know, Lily Allen is a newer artist who has recently peaked at the number two position in the UK with her single, Alright Still.

1125
01:11:38,214 --> 01:11:40,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually peaked at number 20 here in the US.

1126
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is who Lily Allen is.

1127
01:11:43,077 --> 01:11:45,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen this, I've probably heard this song before.

1128
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:47,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't make me pull up a clip.

1129
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,411
[SPEAKER_06]: To which I would say, all right, still don't care.

1130
01:11:52,632 --> 01:12:08,198
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you do win this contest, though, you will be winning a prize package worth approximately $1,390 and have a chance to record a song in Simlish for possible inclusion in a future Sims 2 game.

1131
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:09,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1132
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:16,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, you get to sing a song in gibberish that's going to appear in a game that probably no one will actually pay attention to the music in.

1133
01:12:16,376 --> 01:12:17,437
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds awesome!

1134
01:12:17,998 --> 01:12:19,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to sing a song in gibberish.

1135
01:12:24,945 --> 01:12:25,466
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my song.

1136
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:26,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Lily Allen, you listening?

1137
01:12:27,508 --> 01:12:29,371
[SPEAKER_05]: You could totally sample me on your next record.

1138
01:12:32,091 --> 01:12:32,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob... So how about SingStar?

1139
01:12:49,217 --> 01:12:53,959
[SPEAKER_03]: and they are going to be doing this thing called Game 3.0.

1140
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:56,699
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very interesting thing.

1141
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:03,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you're going to be able to download new content but upload content as well using your USB camera.

1142
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:11,943
[SPEAKER_03]: You can record videos and then everyone will look at it so it'd be like, you know, like the Numa Numa kid or something.

1143
01:13:13,284 --> 01:13:17,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear God who is in heaven, please listen to this boy's prayer.

1144
01:13:17,972 --> 01:13:20,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been a very good Rob this whole year long.

1145
01:13:20,955 --> 01:13:37,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please, please, God Almighty who art in heaven, please, please make Loki get really drunk one night and record some videos on SingStar and upload them to this Game 3 point whatever service so that the entirety of the internet can download and make fun of him.

1146
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:38,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, amen.

1147
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:39,271
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1148
01:13:40,151 --> 01:13:41,292
[SPEAKER_01]: God doesn't listen to you.

1149
01:13:43,474 --> 01:13:45,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, Loki, you know you want to do it.

1150
01:13:46,778 --> 01:13:47,859
[SPEAKER_06]: You want me to do that?

1151
01:13:47,879 --> 01:13:47,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I do!

1152
01:13:47,979 --> 01:13:49,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to do that at all.

1153
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not touching that fucking game.

1154
01:13:51,882 --> 01:13:54,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Karaoke will not be entering my house.

1155
01:13:54,603 --> 01:13:55,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that shit.

1156
01:14:00,347 --> 01:14:04,330
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 says, I don't know, it makes me think of a Caturday macro.

1157
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:07,311
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, I'm in your OLRs, drunk in your hosts.

1158
01:14:09,553 --> 01:14:10,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's God speaking.

1159
01:14:10,534 --> 01:14:11,614
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know we're all going to hell.

1160
01:14:11,634 --> 01:14:12,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

1161
01:14:12,395 --> 01:14:12,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

1162
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Except not me because I don't believe in hell.

1163
01:14:14,962 --> 01:14:16,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to wherever pagan people go.

1164
01:14:16,825 --> 01:14:17,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not turn this into religious.

1165
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,108
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not a god cast.

1166
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:21,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Go look up god cast on iTunes if you want religious stuff.

1167
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:22,732
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to talk about games.

1168
01:14:23,113 --> 01:14:26,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And one game that we'll talk about here is Warhawk.

1169
01:14:27,352 --> 01:14:32,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting because Warhawk, you know, of course, went that it was going to be downloadable only when it went over to the PlayStation 3.

1170
01:14:33,214 --> 01:14:34,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the other thing you need to know.

1171
01:14:34,495 --> 01:14:36,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Warhawk is not going to be single player now.

1172
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:39,257
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a multiplayer only battle arena.

1173
01:14:39,737 --> 01:14:43,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the game has moved into the PlayStation Network, it's a downloadable title.

1174
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:46,179
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only going to be something that you can play online.

1175
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,261
[SPEAKER_05]: But the cool news is that, hey, you don't get to just do planes.

1176
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:53,042
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do jeeps, tanks, infantry units, and the whole works there.

1177
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:55,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get some other online modes as well, but

1178
01:14:55,922 --> 01:14:58,124
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't like to play online games, too bad.

1179
01:14:58,344 --> 01:15:00,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Warhawk will not be for you on the PlayStation 3.

1180
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:25,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So, when you think about high-end computer systems, you probably don't think of Commodore, but they're hoping to change that, because now they are back, and they are trying to make a name for themselves.

1181
01:15:25,716 --> 01:15:31,881
[SPEAKER_05]: If the year was 1984, I would be thinking about Commodore, because the Commodore 64 was my first gaming platform, really, truly.

1182
01:15:32,781 --> 01:15:34,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Commodore 64 is an amazing piece of machinery.

1183
01:15:35,263 --> 01:15:35,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

1184
01:15:36,645 --> 01:15:46,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, now they're launching a new Commodore PC geared for PC gaming and it's supposed to launch at Germany's C-Bit show actually this week on March 15th.

1185
01:15:47,588 --> 01:15:50,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know.

1186
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:54,049
[SPEAKER_06]: They're basically saying this can provide what gamers need and want.

1187
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:56,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

1188
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:58,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I play Last Ninja on it?

1189
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes or no?

1190
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:00,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I think better.

1191
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:05,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if not, there's going to be one hell of a syntax error coming out of this

1192
01:16:06,047 --> 01:16:06,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Angry Gamer.

1193
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:09,328
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a Commodore joke.

1194
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:10,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't laugh at once.

1195
01:16:10,628 --> 01:16:12,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's why no one got it.

1196
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:16,490
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we're on the internet, boys and girls, not satellite radio or the real deal.

1197
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we should call ourselves Video Obscura.

1198
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:20,051
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be an awesome name.

1199
01:16:20,071 --> 01:16:21,552
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually not a bad name for a podcast.

1200
01:16:21,852 --> 01:16:23,852
[SPEAKER_05]: At least Video Gamer Obscura.

1201
01:16:25,453 --> 01:16:29,854
[SPEAKER_05]: At least people would know we're a video game podcast as opposed to when people go, what the hell's Orange Lounge Radio?

1202
01:16:30,034 --> 01:16:31,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys a lounge music podcast?

1203
01:16:32,315 --> 01:16:35,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we just had Richard Cheese on last week.

1204
01:16:37,245 --> 01:16:45,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of cheese, there is a LEGO MMO that is in development coming in 2008.

1205
01:16:46,007 --> 01:16:52,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being developed by NetDevil for AutoAssault.

1206
01:16:52,569 --> 01:16:58,170
[SPEAKER_03]: You go around building stuff and talking with people, it's just a MMO with LEGOs.

1207
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's for kids, but...

1208
01:17:01,545 --> 01:17:04,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Legos, so I'm probably going to play it just to see what it's like.

1209
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:05,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Legos, too.

1210
01:17:05,307 --> 01:17:07,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when you tried to make the charging cradle out of Legos.

1211
01:17:08,068 --> 01:17:09,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I did make a charging cradle.

1212
01:17:09,228 --> 01:17:15,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, I broke the charging cradle this week because Nellie wanted to play Elite Beat Agents because she's been playing that game now.

1213
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:20,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to rip the cable out because it doesn't work very well plugged into the DS.

1214
01:17:20,753 --> 01:17:25,395
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that didn't hear the shows a while back, Loki actually built a DS charger out of Legos.

1215
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,086
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1216
01:17:33,932 --> 01:17:34,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Legos too.

1217
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:36,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Actual Legos.

1218
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:39,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much all these games.

1219
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:40,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Legos.

1220
01:17:40,475 --> 01:17:45,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I measure my Legos in gallons now, and I still have 10 gallons of Legos in my closet.

1221
01:17:46,137 --> 01:17:48,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's build the next OLR studio out of Legos.

1222
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:50,099
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have enough Legos for that.

1223
01:17:50,559 --> 01:17:51,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I did one time build something.

1224
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:59,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have this desk that stretched one whole wall on my room, and I used every single Lego to build one giant, like,

1225
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:04,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard a rumor you were going to, I don't know if I can say it on air, but

1226
01:18:25,231 --> 01:18:29,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm planning on, if I can at all manage it, I'm going to be going to DragonCon.

1227
01:18:30,715 --> 01:18:37,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go to be there at the podcaster's panel, just, you know, right now it's like, how am I going to afford that?

1228
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,361
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm working on it.

1229
01:18:38,421 --> 01:18:43,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Monopoly pinball and I was actually kicking ass over at Sunnyvale Golf Land yesterday.

1230
01:18:44,405 --> 01:18:46,747
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck does that have to do with anything DragonCon?

1231
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:48,068
[SPEAKER_06]: She mentioned pinball.

1232
01:18:49,864 --> 01:19:01,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I told everybody, but we did get a new machine and we got a Bride of Pinbot.

1233
01:19:01,329 --> 01:19:05,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan has my Rocky and Bullwinkle working now, which makes me intensely happy.

1234
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:07,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And our Guns N' Roses is now for sale.

1235
01:19:08,651 --> 01:19:10,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, will you sell it to someone on the internets?

1236
01:19:11,172 --> 01:19:12,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but shipping would be an arm and a leg.

1237
01:19:13,177 --> 01:19:17,558
[SPEAKER_03]: If they live in the area or want to come pick it up and pay us a lot of money for it, then I don't think they'll mind.

1238
01:19:17,578 --> 01:19:17,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Define a lot.

1239
01:19:18,078 --> 01:19:19,558
[SPEAKER_05]: How much are you selling the Guns N' Roses for?

1240
01:19:19,598 --> 01:19:19,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1241
01:19:20,058 --> 01:19:20,638
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to Dan.

1242
01:19:22,019 --> 01:19:25,179
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually may have a trade worked out on it, but I think we're also selling our Johnny Mnemonic.

1243
01:19:25,819 --> 01:19:27,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good pin, but I hate Johnny Mnemonic.

1244
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You should let us know some prices.

1245
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:37,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll talk to the hubby and see if he wants me to use our independent, non-corporate sponsored podcast to sell my pinball machine.

1246
01:19:37,461 --> 01:19:37,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1247
01:19:37,942 --> 01:19:39,262
[SPEAKER_05]: You ought to get something out of this deal.

1248
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:40,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1249
01:19:40,424 --> 01:19:42,585
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, something else you can do if you love Orange Lounge Radio.

1250
01:19:42,605 --> 01:19:44,986
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll give some cheap plugs for some of our other stuff right now.

1251
01:19:45,546 --> 01:19:51,589
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always leave us a review on iTunes because we could definitely use some more five-star review on iTunes because it helps spread the word about the program.

1252
01:19:52,230 --> 01:20:01,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you can visit our MySpace, www.myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and be our friend on there because who doesn't love having a thousand friends on MySpace?

1253
01:20:01,894 --> 01:20:03,075
[SPEAKER_05]: and being Attention Whores over there.

1254
01:20:03,896 --> 01:20:08,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we are now participating in the new All Games Community site over at community.allgames.com.

1255
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of us are so far.

1256
01:20:09,401 --> 01:20:10,742
[SPEAKER_05]: You will be as of tonight.

1257
01:20:12,363 --> 01:20:13,945
[SPEAKER_05]: We will all have profiles on that site.

1258
01:20:13,965 --> 01:20:15,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually using my blog over there.

1259
01:20:15,366 --> 01:20:15,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of fun.

1260
01:20:16,327 --> 01:20:26,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been doing official, well not, I don't know, official whatever, but Orange Lounge video game review haikus where I review games in haiku form.

1261
01:20:27,477 --> 01:20:29,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to see what the hell that's all about,

1262
01:20:29,414 --> 01:20:42,557
[SPEAKER_05]: you gotta go find my page on the community all games site because I review video games in haiku form 575 anything else we should plug before we take a break I don't know

1263
01:20:42,861 --> 01:20:43,902
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1264
01:21:04,622 --> 01:21:06,283
[SPEAKER_06]: At least on my Comcast box.

1265
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:18,030
[SPEAKER_06]: So two channels were Spike TV, which were playing some really crappy Bros vs. Joes or something like that thing, which I don't have any interest in sports TV.

1266
01:21:18,431 --> 01:21:21,873
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was funny, though, because all of a sudden it was like Spike TV.

1267
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:27,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, last night I was watching G4 TV because they had cheaters on, and that was kind of funny.

1268
01:21:27,116 --> 01:21:29,237
[SPEAKER_06]: What else are you going to watch at midnight?

1269
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:31,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1270
01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:33,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I could have watched Saturday Night Live, but that's not funny.

1271
01:21:34,744 --> 01:21:35,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1272
01:22:03,922 --> 01:22:05,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you massage your way to DragonCon?

1273
01:22:29,099 --> 01:22:29,780
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1274
01:22:49,641 --> 01:22:50,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Massage is good for your health.

1275
01:22:50,922 --> 01:22:53,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they need, you know, conventions are a lot of walking.

1276
01:22:53,663 --> 01:22:54,563
[SPEAKER_05]: You should massage people's feet.

1277
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:59,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually thinking about, because a lot of my friends are on the Fonamay staff.

1278
01:23:00,145 --> 01:23:03,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually thinking about asking them if I can get an event license for the day.

1279
01:23:03,206 --> 01:23:04,627
[SPEAKER_05]: God, Fonamay is right around the corner too.

1280
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:05,827
[SPEAKER_03]: May, end of May.

1281
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:06,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
