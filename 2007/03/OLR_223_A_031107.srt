Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gamer culture and gamer lifestyle

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hi

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How are you doing?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I has salad

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You have a salad, a yummy salad?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I has a salad

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I has a fresh choice earlier today, it was good

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I has Quiznos

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Do they have fresh choice all throughout the country?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know, is that a local thing?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Basically it's an entire restaurant that's a giant salad bar

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The only way you get salad bars is if you go to Shoney's

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Or Sizzler's

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We don't have Sizzler's in Alabama

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I know what Shoney's is, but they don't have that here

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Shoney's is nasty

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well so is Waffle House, yet it's still popular

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Waffle House is not nasty!

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Waffle House has special drugs that they put in the hash browns

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A whole place dedicated to salad is nasty

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What the fuck?

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
They have pizza

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's a pita's dream, I mean seriously

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They have pizza

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Or pita's dream, yeah

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They have pizza and soup too

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, well soup is okay

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Fucking, why the fuck is pizza there?

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's just so random

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I guess it's healthy pizza, I don't know

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well I remember, god I went there a long ass time ago with an ex

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I had pasta there, pasta was okay, but salad is just nasty

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They have the best bread ever though

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's what food eats, I don't eat that, I eat food

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright, well let's get into tonight's program

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
First off actually I want to say, Techmaster Loki, did you notice

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We did not get the FUs of the Week music automatically start playing

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was a good boy this week and made that not play

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's because he told you to

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What?

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No, I thought of it all by myself

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Stupid Jamie revealing stupid behind the scenes stuff

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Alright anyhow, also I do want to plug the chat room

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We have lots of boys and girls that come there to chat with us

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Kind of the fourth guest of our program

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
When we don't have any other regular fourth guest such as tonight

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We don't really have a regular fourth guest, that kind of sucks

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I tried to get Dan to come

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh really?

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And his loud friends

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Probably for the best they didn't come then

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, they're playing some card game

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We had a guest and then he left

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
When's Marissa coming back?

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Maybe next week

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sweet, how about Chris?

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Maybe next week

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Because I'm horribly broke

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have to have Chris and Marissa come up here for doing the birthday stuff

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think that might be when Rice Princess and Eddie come here too

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So we could get everybody in here in one week

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You know what, we could just all leave

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Honestly, three of us could just take the night off, let them do the show

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What do you say chat room?

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let Chris, Rice Princess, Marissa, and Eddie do the show instead of us

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What do you say?

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We'll take the night off, we'll go out to eat

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's do that

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We'll go to Country Waffles

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Our knockoff of Waffle House we have out here

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, we'll go to Fresh Choice

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They closed at four

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The entire chat room's at no, no, no

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And they're only open breakfast and lunch

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh damn it

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, we got a hell yeah from Zappy, there you go, DDR dollar bill, hell fucking yes

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They don't love us anymore is what it boils down to

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's sad

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Alright, well let's start off tonight's program the way we usually start it off

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
With a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Where we talk about the games we've been playing this week

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If anything at all, Dark Sakura

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Still, huh?

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, and then Dan had to take it back so he's just gonna buy it for me after Pay Day

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The only freaking PS3 game I will play, like, regularly

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I love my PlayStation 3 now

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It gives me Captain America and Wolverine

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In the same game

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Although the damn thing is on the Wii and the 360 as well

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't care

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
360 get achievement points

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's true, the Wii you could do

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Flippy, floppy movie things

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You know what, I don't like doing that

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I do not like doing that

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have to say, as much as I love the Wii

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think that when you have games

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That are made for play like that

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's one thing, but when you have a fucking platformer

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I just fucking put a controller in my hand and let me play

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
One thing I actually don't like about the PS3 one

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Is that it has you flip the controller to pull

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I was gonna say the PlayStation 3 uses that six axis

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But it's stupid

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Six axis, like a normal word

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Because, you know, Sony wants that big marketing oomph behind the words

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Six axis

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It sounds like an alien race from Doctor Who

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Kinda

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Exterminate

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
God damn it, Tigerclaw

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why do you have to drive the knife in my heart?

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm assuming, I haven't even looked at chat

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm assuming Tigerclaw is talking about

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How your Wednesday must have been

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How did your Wednesday go?

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I hate you Marvel

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You bitches

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
In case for whatever reason this is your first week listening to Orange Launch Radio

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You know, Sony is talking about our personal lives as well

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And one thing that Dark Soccer is also a fangirl of

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Is comics, namely

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Captain America

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Which is funny because really on this program

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I know you've liked Captain America a long time

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But it really seems like, especially in the past six weeks

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Your fandom seems to have rekindled

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because I started reading all the Civil War comics

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And I was like, dude, he's cool

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But then, so it was kinda funny

142
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I mean, not like funny haha

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But funny like, don't call Jamie today

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Like when I saw it in the news

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That they'd killed off Captain America

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So how was your day when that happened?

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He will be back

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You think he'll be back?

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh come on, it's a fucking

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You know, Marvel needs money

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So they do a gimmicky thing

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I was looking at your

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All games community page today

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And somebody decided to jab the knife through your heart

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A little more there and say, going

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Basically somebody put a comment on Jamie's page and said like

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Haha, Captain America died

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What do you say to those people that say

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Haha, Captain America died?

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Die in a fire

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's what I thought

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is there anything else in your week you want to talk about?

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Um

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I really like my salad

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Salad the game

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's alright, we don't have to worry about Captain America dying

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because Afghanistan is going to come and replace him

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Wow, that's a very unpolitically correct comment

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And he's going to be far more awesome

172
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
My gaming week was filled with lots of stuff actually

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I played quite a few different games

174
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Starting on the 360

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Of course played Crackdown

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Because Crackdown is awesome

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I did play

178
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What else did I play?

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, Armored Core 4

180
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Which is pretty cool

181
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's going a lot faster than

182
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
ChromeHounds

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Looking forward to that, I'm not sure if I want to pick it up yet

184
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Because I'm trying to cut back on the amount of games I buy

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But it's still pretty cool

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
On the Playstation 3

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I downloaded Flow

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Tried that

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It was pretty good, kind of relaxing I guess

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I didn't realize that there were actually

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Stages in the game

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So it's kind of neat they get to become different things

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Including like a dolphin looking thing

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So that's kind of neat

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And then I played Motorstorm

196
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Which Motorstorm is pretty awesome

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Graphically and it's pretty fun to play

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
My only gripe on it

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Split screen multiplayer for one

200
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That would have been nice

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The other thing is

202
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The game looks so awesome

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And there's like some pretty cool

204
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Animation in the menus and stuff

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But during races

206
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The fucking spectators are cardboard cutouts

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And they're not even animated cardboard cutouts

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
They're just like stuck in a pose

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And I'm like

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I understand that you know you probably couldn't animate

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
All these people in the game

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Even though other games can do that

213
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know

214
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's how I was in the Gran Turismo HD concept at E3 right?

215
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh yeah and I still thought I was retarded there

216
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Huh

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Granted they're probably trying to save on

218
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You know calculations and stuff

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
To make it run smoother but

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The least you could do is make them animate

221
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
A little bit so I can kind of go

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay at least that doesn't look

223
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
As hokey you know

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's 2D but at least it's animating

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Or doing something you know cheering and stuff

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why is it just a person standing there frozen

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It just looks retarded that's something you would do

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
On like the fucking Super Nintendo

229
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Or something and even the fucking

230
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Super Nintendo had animated sprites

231
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That were cheering in the background

232
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah but those little dudes aren't sprites anymore

233
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sprites are so last gen

234
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay well it's still

235
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Something that's sitting there at 3D spaces

236
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
2D okay whatever

237
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So they could have done that

238
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's my big gripe on that

239
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Otherwise the game's fun

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You know I had a lot of fun playing it

241
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Speaking of last gen Alpha Canogram in chat says

242
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Loki split screen multiplayer is so

243
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Last gen

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh yeah it's so last gen that's why

245
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Halo 3 is gonna fucking have split screen multiplayer

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's why Call of Duty 3

247
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Has split screen multiplayer

248
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's why Gears of War has split screen multiplayer

249
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So fuck off it's still

250
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
In town okay

251
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No last gen it's because you can't

252
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Fucking program a game that can have multiple

253
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Instances of it running at the same time

254
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So that's just lazy

255
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Programming which you know

256
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh I'm sure Motorstorm wasn't lazy

257
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Programming it wasn't like they downgraded from

258
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
1080p and 60 frames per second

259
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
To 720p and 30 frames per second

260
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Which I still say though

261
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The game looks fun

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And it looks pretty awesome

263
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Some other things that they probably didn't think about though

264
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
When you're playing in first person like say

265
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
In the cockpit type of thing

266
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And it's not really in the cockpit

267
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The camera's just on the front of the vehicle

268
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Which is still stupid

269
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But if you happen to crash into something

270
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And your hood gets bent

271
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You could actually not be able to drive in that perspective

272
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because it's blocking the whole camera

273
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Which totally makes sense

274
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But anyways

275
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So other than Playstation 3 stuff

276
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's see here

277
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
On the PSP I was playing of course

278
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

279
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Which is fun

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I also put some homebrew stuff on there

281
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Including this game called No Gravity

282
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Which I might say that this game right here

283
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They could totally sell at retail

284
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And it looks a lot better than most of the PSP games

285
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Out there

286
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And so the fact that most of those games out there

287
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
For the PSP are getting their asses kicked

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
By a homebrew game

289
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's pretty sad

290
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
A demo for a game looks way better

291
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Than a lot of stuff like Konami

292
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Capcom, whatever

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Put out on the PSP

294
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It can be done

295
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I just would like to see some more independent games come out there

296
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Maybe something like XNA

297
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Or something like that for the PSP

298
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Would be pretty awesome

299
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But that's about it

300
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm about to load the Thrill Kill

301
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And DDR Fifth Mix on my PSP

302
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
During the show

303
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Keep us posted on that

304
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So you're not actually going to be participating in tonight's show?

305
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh ok

306
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do that in between

307
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hitstun wants to know

308
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Does the retail MotorStorm crash every five minutes?

309
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Nope

310
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Wasn't it determined that the crashing of MotorStorm

311
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Was the resetting of the system gone wrong

312
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
When people were supposed to...

313
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It was because it was overheating

314
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't know

315
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Download the demo, it doesn't crash on the PS3

316
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Fine, whatever

317
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
My Gaming Week, surprisingly enough

318
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I actually played a little bit of Crackdown this week

319
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Which is usually not the type of game I would get into

320
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But Crackdown is kind of fun

321
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's like Grand Theft Auto

322
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Only there's no hookers to have sex with

323
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And you jump really really high

324
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And flying all over the place

325
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But I find there's a lot to discover

326
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I kind of like just walking around doing random stuff

327
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't really like having to fight the gangs

328
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And get into that whole thing

329
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No, I like to jump around the Ferris wheel

330
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And do the little race around the Ferris wheel

331
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That stuff's fun

332
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And finding the orbs and all that stupid crap

333
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Good times with Crackdown

334
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
A couple people tried to challenge me

335
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
In co-op or whatever

336
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Or I guess you don't really challenge someone in co-op

337
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They wanted to play co-op with me and I declined

338
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Because I suck at Crackdown

339
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But this week I'll probably actually play

340
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because I was still trying to learn Crackdown

341
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't want someone to come into the game with me

342
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing

343
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Did I just shoot you? Oh shit, I just blew you up with a rocket

344
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know

345
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I kind of want to have a little skill

346
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Because sometimes I feel weird playing listeners

347
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
On the Xbox friends list

348
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But I think the listeners sometimes expect us to actually be good at games

349
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Because we talk about them

350
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We really don't know about you

351
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, hi Rice Princess, you came out of nowhere

352
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, sorry

353
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They really don't know much about you then

354
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No, they don't

355
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I was a jab at you

356
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
JeremyTau1 said, Rob didn't want to play co-op with me

357
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He denied me when I asked to join his game

358
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Actually that may not have been me

359
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Because the other thing you have to keep in mind

360
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Is that Shane has been playing my game without asking

361
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I wish he could set a password

362
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
On the Xbox Live accounts

363
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe he can, I just haven't done it

364
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't care, but Shane has been signing on to my account

365
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And playing Crackdown

366
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I only let him do it because he's been getting me achievements

367
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So it's all good

368
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because I'm still trying to get those 1500 points

369
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So I can win, what was it?

370
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Like a gamer picture and a copy of a game I already own

371
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Contra, something like that

372
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Because I want my e-penis to grow by 1500 points

373
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
With the whole Xbox Live contest thing

374
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So that would be fun

375
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What?

376
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So you're having an e-penis fluffer take over

377
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes, Shane is fluffing my e-penis

378
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Maybe right now as we speak

379
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Don't make a face, Rice Princess

380
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

381
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If you have anything to share

382
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Hey, guess what? I was playing WoW

383
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Wow, you played WoW

384
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Wow, that's the same as every other week

385
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I play a lot of World of Warcraft as well, actually

386
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I know

387
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Almost every time I come on, I see you

388
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I made a troll

389
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're a troll

390
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That wasn't nice

391
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well she is, she said she made a troll

392
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I made a troll

393
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Jamie's a troll

394
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're a dirty napkin

395
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Totally should

396
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So did you do anything fun in WoW?

397
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Aren't you one of those twink players?

398
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You don't level past level 19

399
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
With all your gear?

400
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's 29, get it right

401
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh, it's 29 now

402
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Because you told me when I played on your server once

403
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That you play nothing but Warsong Gulch for the rest of your life

404
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah, that's what I did originally

405
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But then I discovered the world of 29

406
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And I was like, wow, you get poisons as a rogue

407
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And you get Arathi Basin

408
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Which I think is an awesome PVP

409
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Exactly

410
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Because Warsong Gulch is so

411
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Last gen

412
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh my god, yeah, like who does that anymore?

413
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
God

414
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's all about Isla Storm

415
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The other thing I want to know, where exactly did the term

416
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Twink come from? Because when I hear

417
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Twink, I think about something very different

418
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't think about

419
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
World of Warcraft, I think about

420
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The gay porn that you see advertised

421
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The twink porn

422
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know, it's a little weird

423
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's where the mind goes

424
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
How did a World of Warcraft

425
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Term come up to match up with a

426
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Gay term?

427
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know for certain, but I have my

428
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Theory

429
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Twinks are like

430
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The young, hot

431
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Boys, right? Like the good looking

432
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Ones that

433
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

434
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But sure, I guess I get what you're getting at

435
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Like magazine looking guys

436
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Well why don't you elaborate on what exactly a

437
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Gay twink is?

438
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know if all the listeners want to know

439
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's basically a person who

440
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I would think, a guy who kind of looks

441
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Underage, who isn't

442
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Like your blonde hair, blue eyed

443
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That whole thing

444
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Completely waxed everywhere

445
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Type look

446
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So like the best looking

447
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No?

448
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It has to do with like an

449
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Age thing?

450
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Do we really have to keep going with this topic?

451
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Maybe my perception of what a twink is

452
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Is different

453
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I thought it was like

454
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It had something to do with old men

455
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Liking twinks

456
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So they would be their sugar daddies

457
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And give them a lot of money

458
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And I'm thinking, okay, well to be a twink

459
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You need to pay for your stuff

460
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So maybe twinking is like

461
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Horing yourself out to get money

462
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
To get all these awesome enchants

463
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But that's just a theory

464
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't really know

465
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I just heard a bunch of people say, oh, twink, twink, twink

466
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And I was like, okay, sure

467
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's exactly what I am

468
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If by twink you mean awesome

469
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Alright

470
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm trying to see if there's anything in the chat room here

471
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That says what's going on

472
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
JV Mon says, welcome to Gay Slang Chat on OLR

473
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Let's see

474
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Squeenix says

475
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In the gay slang

476
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Twink is a term that describes a young

477
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Or young looking male, usually of slender build

478
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
With little to no body hair

479
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Often they are described as blonde hair and blue eyed

480
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
To many gay men

481
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The term is pejorative

482
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And implies shallowness and stupidity

483
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Twinks are typically contrasted with bears

484
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And that's from Wikipedia

485
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So there you have it

486
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But that doesn't say anything about, how the hell then

487
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You know what, I have no idea

488
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I didn't realize there were so many gay players

489
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And wow, right

490
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That they would come up with the term

491
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm done with this topic

492
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm done with that, let's talk about other news

493
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But I only stopped by to say hi

494
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Someone leave now

495
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Bye, get out, we don't like you anyway

496
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Get out

497
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes

498
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Most of the podcasts you're listening to this week

499
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Are probably going to be talking a lot about

500
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Their experiences at Game Developers Conference

501
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But not us, we didn't go

502
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Nope

503
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's right, we sat home on our big butts

504
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And read about it on the internet

505
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Just like most of you guys out there did at home

506
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I was originally going to go to Game Developers Conference

507
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But some things came up

508
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And I didn't end up going

509
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But we did get to

510
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Go to San Francisco yesterday to meet

511
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Some people that we, you know

512
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If I had gone to Game Developers Conference

513
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It would have been like a networking thing

514
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Like I would have gotten to meet a lot of people

515
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So what we did is we drove to San Francisco

516
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Because some of our buddies over at All Games

517
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Were in town and of course we rebroadcast our program

518
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Over on All Games on Monday nights

519
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So we went over and met with some of the

520
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
All Games folks, we met with Bobby

521
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And we met with Lawrence, although Lawrence we were

522
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Basically taking to the airport so we didn't get to spend a lot of time with him

523
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But Bobby who does the

524
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Other Sunday night show you might listen to over

525
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
On All Games, we spent some time with him

526
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
When we went to Sunnyvale Golf Land

527
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Which, you know, is a pretty big

528
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Arcade, kind of infamous

529
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
In Northern California for the many fighting game

530
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Tournaments it's had and

531
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
DDR music game tournaments it's had

532
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Kind of sad to go

533
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In there and see the place as

534
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Basically turned into like the entire middle

535
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Where they used to have tons of classic

536
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Games, like you know

537
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They had like the old school fighting games

538
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And stuff were all up in the middle section

539
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
All gone and it's all ticket spitters now

540
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Which kind of made me sad

541
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't know, I made this big long rant over

542
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
At my All Games blog

543
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Over at community.allgames.com

544
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
About

545
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
How kind of sad it is just to see that

546
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The arcades are kind of

547
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Really giving way to the ticket spitters

548
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And although Sunnyvale Golf Land did have

549
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Some pretty cool music

550
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Games, they had, you know, Be Me and You

551
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
2DX Happy Sky which I got to play and they had

552
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Pop'n Music 8 which was cool and they had some

553
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Nice racing games, they had

554
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Like everything in the little niche genres they had

555
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know, it was kind of sad to see

556
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That most of the arcade is turned into that whole

557
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Gambling for kids thing

558
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So it kind of got me thinking

559
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What do you think it would take

560
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
For us to really go back to arcades now

561
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Because you know a lot of folks say that arcades

562
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Are dying because

563
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You can get the same experience at home

564
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And you can get a lot of them on Xbox Live

565
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What do arcades need

566
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
To do business again?

567
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
New games and well maintained games

568
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And just something

569
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Because even still you can play DDR at home

570
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But it's not the same as playing in the arcade

571
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And you need the atmosphere back

572
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's pretty much it

573
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If I were to be opening an arcade

574
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It wouldn't have any ticket spitters

575
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
At all

576
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't care if that's why kids come in there

577
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But you need to bring people in

578
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That are looking for the arcade experience

579
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Not just have arcade games

580
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So that little Billy can run in there

581
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And say mommy mommy I want to spend money

582
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And play games and stuff

583
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And win crap with tickets

584
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They just kind of have that stuff

585
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Out of golf land

586
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Keep people there longer after their game of golf

587
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Or before their game of golf

588
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Dave and Busters

589
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Dave and Busters is kind of like that for adults

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I mean do you really play a lot of the arcade games

591
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Dave and Busters? Maybe a few

592
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But a lot of us kind of succumb to the whole ticket spitting

593
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Thing at Dave and Busters because we're drunk

594
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Right?

595
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No I usually go often

596
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You know when they had the

597
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What was the meca salt

598
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I know that that was always what

599
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Whenever I'd go with Dan and the guys

600
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That would be what they went right for

601
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And I always played my deluxe games

602
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But they got rid of meca salt

603
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Stupid fuckers

604
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm not really angry at the ticket spitters

605
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Necessarily it's disappointing to see

606
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But if that's where the money is

607
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's not like I'm totally mad at golf land

608
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Because if that's where the money is

609
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's what they're going to buy

610
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Granted those ticket spitters probably make them a ton of money

611
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But I try to think about

612
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What's really been new in the arcade lately

613
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That I've had to get excited about

614
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
DDR Supernova?

615
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Well I'm sorry Bomani fans

616
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But DDR Supernova

617
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Was pretty much just a DDR 9th mix

618
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It didn't bring a whole lot of new stuff to the table

619
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Really

620
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It was just kind of the same game all over again

621
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And even you could say the games like

622
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
In the Groove and stuff that tried to fill in the gaps

623
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Same thing it was 4 panel dancing

624
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It was the same damn game you always knew

625
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But even DDR alone was not going to save an arcade

626
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know what I mean?

627
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
There hasn't been a lot of new stuff in general

628
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I mean the last big new arcade release

629
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I can think of was Soul Calibur 3

630
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But that was already on the home consoles

631
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So I don't know

632
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It seems like they're really starting to go away from making arcade games

633
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's kind of sad

634
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Because if it weren't for that arcade community

635
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This show would not exist

636
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Period

637
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We need more Planet Harrier

638
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't know if that's going to save it

639
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We'll see

640
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm trying to go to the chat room

641
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com

642
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
See I had all games on the brain

643
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Because of our little discussion with Bobby

644
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Don't go to that chat room, that's the wrong one

645
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com

646
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's see

647
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm trying to see what kind of chat is going on here

648
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Fireboma says the arcade by me

649
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Is just having games that are more like rides now

650
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Some of those can be okay though

651
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Remember After Burner?

652
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
With the freaking thing that you would sit in

653
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That would practically make you sick?

654
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Let's see

655
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
NM64 says

656
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Arcade Halo

657
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Sadly that would probably bring them back

658
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You know, I kind of tend to agree

659
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Something like that

660
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Do they have that?

661
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Do you remember The Grid?

662
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
They have Half Life in Japan where you can play that in the arcade

663
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Really? I think about a game we saw at E3

664
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
A couple years ago

665
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I remember it was 04, 05

666
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And Amiro of all companies was showing off

667
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This arcade game that would actually interface with computer versions of the game

668
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It was like a first person shooter

669
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah, that's pretty cool

670
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
OL Army Recruit

671
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm sorry, James Patrick says

672
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Virtua Fighter 5 should come to US arcades

673
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't know

674
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That would be interesting

675
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Alright, so I don't know if there's an easy answer

676
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
To how arcades can be kind of fun again

677
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
For all of us

678
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Not just, you know, kids

679
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
8 through 12 or whatever

680
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
We welcome your feedback

Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com

682
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And bloggyblog

683
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Over at the community.allgames site

684
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And leave a comment, that would be awesome

685
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And I just want to say thanks to Bobby

686
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
For hanging out with us yesterday

687
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And you should check out his show

688
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
He's on allgames.com at 5 o'clock pacific time

689
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
About an hour before we go live over here

690
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
At OrangeLawnsRadio.com

691
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He also does a podcast

692
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's a different show over there

693
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Because it's just him and his chat room and his callers

694
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So the chat and the callers

695
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Really drive that show

696
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
He's a pretty good moderator

697
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And he actually moderated a panel at GDC

698
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That Loki and I listened to on the car ride home

699
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It was pretty good. Good times

700
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And I forgot to mention

701
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I played a lot of games over at

702
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You know, Sunnyvale Golf Land

703
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Loki playing popin' music was fuckin' hilarious

704
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I hate popin' music

705
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But I had like $10 in tokens

706
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And I needed to get rid of them

707
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And I was too tired to play DDR

708
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yet I did play more of it

709
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So I played popin' 8

710
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
At popin' music

711
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm not surprised because I knew I sucked

712
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
At popin' music

713
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's just I really sucked at popin' music

714
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I played the Star Trek theme and that sucked

715
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And then I played some random song

716
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And that really sucked

717
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And then I played 2DX, Happy Sky

718
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And I sucked at that and that was fun

719
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And I played Supernova and Supernova was pretty good

720
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Until I picked a random double song

721
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That was like a cata or something

722
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And I was too tired to play it

723
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I played part of it though

724
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm just getting too out of shape for this

725
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm out of practice

726
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
BlackWolf

727
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Is actually in chat right now and says

728
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Sky might have taken video on his phone, actually didn't

729
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I did take a picture though, I'll put that on the community site later

730
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Of Loki playing popin' music

731
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Good times

732
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Good times

733
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
James Patrick's continuing on the Virtua Fighter 5 thing

734
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That would be great

735
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Knowing you could fight anyone in Japan or America

736
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Who's using the Virtua Fighter 5 arcade

737
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Kinda going with that whole thing about

738
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Being able to interface with computers and stuff

739
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Pretty cool

740
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Illusion says that Pachinko machines could revitalize arcades

741
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That's an interesting thought

742
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Alright

743
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So anyway we had fun at the arcade the other day

744
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But going back to Game Developers Conference

745
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And starting off tonight's news

746
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I want to talk about of course

747
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Huge news in the Sony department

748
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
In fact this news is like so big

749
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We might actually want to take calls on this

750
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Just this a little later

751
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Sony unveiled this week

752
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
At the Game Developers Conference

753
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It's very interesting

754
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And we'll talk about Nintendo's conference in part B

755
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But a lot of the stuff that you saw

756
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Like the big companies do

757
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Was really about the game development

758
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
They didn't turn Game Developers Conference into E3

759
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Like a lot of people thought

760
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Which is a good thing I think

761
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Game developers need their hangout

762
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It was not E3

763
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But Sony kind of used their keynote

764
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
To drop E3 like bombs at

765
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Where they need to right

766
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
They're getting the bad press right now

767
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Everybody kind of gives them a buy

768
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
To use Game Developers Conference as their platform

769
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And some would say they hit a home run

770
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I think so

771
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Key word there is home

772
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
They revealed PlayStation Home

773
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Of course we talked about it last week

774
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But even when we talked about it last week

775
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And the whole Kotaku drama that resulted

776
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I don't think I was expecting anything like this

777
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't think any of us were

778
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
When I heard it was going to be like Animal Crossing

779
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm picturing to myself

780
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh cutesy, cartoony

781
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Animal Crossing with your me's

782
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
No no no no

783
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What they unveiled instead

784
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Is a service that looks like Second Life

785
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's like a virtual world

786
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And here's a screenshot we have here in studio

787
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You can see all these people with their customizable outfits

788
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Kind of walking around this virtual world

789
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But not only that

790
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
When you're in this virtual world

791
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You can invite people over to your virtual apartment

792
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And you can look at your virtual trophy rack

793
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
They've basically taken Microsoft's achievement system

794
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And kind of evolved it into

795
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Hey you can get trophies that you put in your house

796
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Look at my stuff

797
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Come over and look at my stuff

798
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But not just that

799
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Let's say you want to put a TV in your apartment

800
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Then you can run videos on your TV from your PlayStation

801
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Put pictures up on the wall

802
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That you have on your PlayStation drive

803
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Walk up to a pool table that you put down your place

804
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And actually start playing pool

805
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
They're going to have some games included with this

806
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
All of it, free

807
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's going to be part of

808
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's basically what they're saying

809
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What Microsoft is giving you in Xbox Live

810
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We are now going to give you this service

811
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Called PlayStation Home

812
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And it's free

813
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Of course the money that they're going to make

814
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Advertising on all the billboards throughout the place

815
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And people love to customize

816
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So unless you want the raggy

817
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Cheap Ikea furniture in your apartment

818
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
If you want some of the nice

819
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Bling couches and stuff

820
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You're going to have to probably pay for those

821
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
People will probably do it

822
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
People will do that because they buy shit in Second Life

823
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So this will all roll out

824
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
In a closed beta

825
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Of about 15,000 users

826
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Between April and August

827
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The open beta, about 50,000 users

828
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
August through October

829
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And the service will go live with everybody

830
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Probably about October

831
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The best part about those

832
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
They're saying different games

833
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Kind of like how they have with the gamer pics

834
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And the games that you play on Xbox 360

835
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Right now, you're going to be getting

836
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Custom outfits and crap for your house

837
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Basically by playing games

838
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Or unlocking achievements

839
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You'll get different things that way as well

840
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So that's kind of neat

841
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Alright, and that wasn't the only thing

842
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Sony unveiled at the conference, correct?

843
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yes, there's another game that they were

844
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Touting, it's basically a game called

845
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Little Big Planet

846
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And it's basically a community made game

847
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You create your own levels

848
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
The entire thing is physics based

849
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's kind of similar to like Gary's mod

850
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
In Half Life 2

851
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And you create these little

852
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Almost like platformer levels

853
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That you and your friends will play

854
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And try to find their way through

855
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And so it's totally customizable

856
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You'll be able to download them

857
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Rate them, and so on and so forth

858
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But it's just, it looks like

859
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
A lot of fun

860
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And it's actually selling a lot of people

861
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
On the whole

862
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Playstation 3 experience

863
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What they were definitely pushing

864
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
With their keynote was

865
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
This game 3.0 where

866
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Most of the content out there would be

867
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
User created, which is kind of ironic

868
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
When you think about it because

869
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
They have all these firmware updates and stuff

870
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
For the PSP to stop user created

871
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Content for that

872
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I think that's kind of funny

873
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But yeah, definitely

874
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Cool little game

875
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Hopefully it will come out soon

876
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Definitely

877
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
One of the types of things that Sony

878
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Is going to need

879
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's kind of like

880
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I think we've all been waiting for something like this

881
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Out of Sony

882
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I don't know about you guys, but this is definitely

883
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
This put the brakes on the negative Sony press bandwagon

884
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And now I think Sony's turned around

885
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
In another direction

886
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But I would say the question is how much

887
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I've heard people say everything from

888
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Eh, whatever

889
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
To I'm going to go out and buy a Playstation 3

890
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Now this is exactly what I need

891
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
If you guys are Playstation 3 owners

892
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What do you think about this news?

893
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Well it's awesome because their current service

894
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Sucks

895
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
By the way, everyone wants to know

896
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Is BlackWolf still your only friend?

897
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
No he's not

898
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I do have about 7 now

899
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So thank you for those people that sent requests

900
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That's awesome

901
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's just basically

902
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
With the whole friend request system

903
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You don't really know who's on there unless you talk to people

904
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Thank you, I have more than one friend now

905
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That's awesome

906
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So the surface

907
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Since I already own a Playstation 3

908
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I personally probably wouldn't buy

909
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
A Playstation 3

910
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
For just this stuff

911
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But it's definitely helping it

912
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It makes their service look a bit nicer

913
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It fleshes it out

914
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Because before their network service was like

915
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Well fuck, we don't know what they're doing

916
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And to be honest, as of right now they haven't done anything

917
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So this home service

918
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Is going to be pretty awesome

919
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's going to be a great way to actually meet people

920
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And to be able to add more friends that way

921
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And just a really cool community thing

922
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And I think it's going to have the same appeal

923
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
As Second Life or Sims

924
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
People are going to be customizing their own

925
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You're going to see

926
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Home places that are going to be themed around

927
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Your websites

928
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And you know

929
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's going to be crazy

930
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You're going to have people reporting from home

931
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Jamie, any thoughts on this?

932
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I have MySpace

933
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And LiveJournal for getting in touch with people

934
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I think all I would do

935
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Is just sit around and mess with stuff in it

936
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Like I do with The Sims

937
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I hate Second Life by the way

938
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But

939
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It wouldn't be any

940
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It wouldn't make or break it for me

941
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But since I already have it, I would use it

942
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That type of thing

943
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
For me, I don't own a Playstation 3

944
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I've actually had several people ask me

945
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Is this going to make you go buy a Playstation 3?

946
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
No

947
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But it helps

948
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But again, what is the golden rule of gaming boys and girls?

949
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
A system is only as good

950
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
As the games that are on it

951
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Trust me, this is a huge step in the right direction

952
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Because I love that

953
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You know, they've kind of done something

954
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You know, come to think of it

955
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I think we had a caller last week or the week before

956
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And I'm so sorry to the caller

957
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Because I can't remember who called in and said this

958
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But somebody called in and said

959
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Sony is really good at ripping everybody else off

960
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And doing it a little better

961
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That was actually on a podcast

962
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Somebody else said that

963
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But when I heard that on the podcast

964
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I remember somebody calling in

965
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And saying it as well

966
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And I thought to myself

967
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You know, when we took the call on air

968
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I was kind of like, oh yeah, okay

969
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That's a cute thing

970
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But I was kind of thinking when I saw this

971
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
God damn, they're right

972
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That person, whoever called us, stand up and take a bow

973
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Whoever did that

974
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Because that was absolutely right

975
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We all thought

976
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Microsoft's achievement point system was genius

977
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's great, it's wonderful

978
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And now we look at what Playstation 3 is doing

979
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And we go, hmm, the Microsoft thing kind of seems

980
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Kind of not as good as it could be now

981
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Next to that

982
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
They just have the problem of being there first

983
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yeah, I guess so

984
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's just interesting

985
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I still like achievements

986
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I still love 360

987
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But it's just kind of interesting that Sony could still do that

988
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Even with all this negative press

989
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Wow, they really kind of did rip something off

990
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And make it better

991
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
One thing to keep in mind is that with the

992
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
As we progress

993
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
As more and more and more ideas come out

994
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
After a while it's very hard to innovate

995
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Once you've already thought of what you can do

996
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The only other thing you can do

997
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Is expand on the idea

998
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
We've never seen Nintendo doing this

999
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Because they can't embrace online

1000
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So

1001
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Who cares?

1002
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Well, I'm still thinking

1003
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I will probably end up

1004
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Breaking down and buying a Playstation 3

1005
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
When some of the games I want

1006
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Come out like Final Fantasy 13

1007
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But I don't

1008
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Think I still want to run out and buy a Playstation 3

1009
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Just yet for only this

1010
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Although I think it's really cool

1011
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And if you are thinking about buying a Playstation 3

1012
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
For only this

1013
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You need to wait until this stuff comes out

1014
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Because a lot can change

1015
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
They can promise the moon for you

1016
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But they can deliver shit

1017
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Honestly

1018
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I think E3 this year

1019
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
For Sony is so critical

1020
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Because I think they need to make up

1021
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
For Zonkin out last year

1022
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And I think this year at E3

1023
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Now that they've kind of set the stage

1024
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Because that's kind of what they do with the game developers

1025
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Is they've kind of set the stage

1026
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Everything around, the big case

1027
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That Playstation 3 is going to

1028
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The big central thing now

1029
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That Playstation 3 is going to have

1030
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's going to be about the games

1031
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That needs to come out at E3 and say

1032
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Here's the exclusives

1033
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Here's the first party stuff we're developing

1034
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Here's the stuff that's going to really make you want

1035
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
A Playstation 3 now

1036
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because I think about all these trailers and things we saw

1037
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
At E3 last year

1038
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
That we really have never heard about again ever since

1039
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Maybe little bits and pieces here and there

1040
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Africa with a K

1041
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Can we find out why I need Africa

1042
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And why this game is going to be so flipping great

1043
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Because when we saw the trailer before

1044
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We were like, I don't get it

1045
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I think about that game

1046
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I can't even remember what the hell the name of it was

1047
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Remember the trailer showed the gas station blowing up

1048
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Or something in the cars

1049
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
What was that with the two guys

1050
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It looked kind of neat

1051
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
What the hell was that?

1052
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Where did it go?

1053
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I guess so

1054
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I went to vaporware land

1055
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I just think it's so important

1056
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
For Sony to come to E3

1057
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Now saying, now you know the box

1058
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That we're putting this in

1059
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The box off with games

1060
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And that truly is going to get me rah rah rah

1061
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
About Sony again

1062
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm kind of curious

1063
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Has your guys' opinion of Sony changed at all

1064
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
From the home run they hit at Game Developers Conference

1065
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Loki?

1066
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's about time that they did something right

1067
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So that's great

1068
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Originally when I heard about home

1069
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I thought it was going to be a rip off of

1070
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
The Miis

1071
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
No, not at all

1072
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Now it's a rip off of Second Life

1073
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
They took a business model, at least they took the right one

1074
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Because Second Life is

1075
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Really successful

1076
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
As far as people making money off of it

1077
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
As soon as I saw

1078
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh yeah, you're going to be able to buy clothing and stuff like that

1079
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
On the service

1080
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And actually customize your characters

1081
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm like, oh well, cha-ching

1082
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Basically

1083
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
They're going to make a lot of money

1084
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I think it's great

1085
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I do like the way that you can jump in

1086
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And play multiplayer games

1087
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Just by meeting people

1088
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So that's kind of cool

1089
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I don't know

1090
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
They just wait to see what they do with it

1091
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Because they've been talking to a lot of online communities

1092
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
With their games coming out

1093
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's just going to be

1094
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Interesting to see how they implement everything

1095
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
We are going to open up our Skype

1096
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Line in a rare occurrence here

1097
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Just to get your feedback on this component

1098
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Because I think this is so big

1099
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Especially with all the

1100
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Whining

1101
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Just kicking of Sony while they're down

1102
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
People have been doing

1103
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm really curious to see what our listeners think

1104
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
About this whole thing going in the other direction

1105
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
We are going to take some real quick calls

1106
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Before that though I want to get some chat comments

1107
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR

1108
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

1109
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And then I want to hear what Jamie has to say on this as well

1110
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
First let me get some chat comments here

1111
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Let's see

1112
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I was saying that somebody here

1113
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Said something really good up above

1114
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Sorry guys, live radio scrolling around

1115
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
There it is

1116
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Rob D said

1117
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
This doesn't matter to me

1118
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I need games

1119
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Not a Trojan Horse Media Center

1120
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Give me games

1121
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It would be a good bonus

1122
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Let's see

1123
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Allusion says yeah a new Sims game comes out

1124
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And someone says I like the Sims better

1125
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
When it was called PlayStation Home

1126
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I think kind of making a joke about

1127
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
How Sony kind of rips things off and does it better

1128
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Let's see

1129
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The game is shallow and sucks except for resistance

1130
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Even now

1131
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Zappy I believe saved the day there

1132
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Earlier in chat Zappy believes that the game

1133
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I was talking about was called 8 days

1134
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That sounds right

1135
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That does sound right to me as well

1136
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Dark Soccer do you have anything you want to

1137
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Say about the whole Sony

1138
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Has your opinion of them changed?

1139
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Or you still think they are eating crayons over there or what?

1140
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I still think they are eating crayons

1141
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But this is a step away from the crayons

1142
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I think that they have moved away from crayons

1143
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
They are eating paste

1144
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Because paste at least

1145
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Is flour based

1146
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
They are eating

1147
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Paste in those little

1148
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Star shaped

1149
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
String cheese nuggets

1150
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Let's go to the skype line

1151
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And see what people think on this

1152
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Who is this?

1153
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Ravenstaufen

1154
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
What do you think about Sony at

1155
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
GDC?

1156
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's definitely a step in the right direction

1157
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Are you a Playstation 3 owner currently?

1158
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I wish, no

1159
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But you say you wish now

1160
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
No I have been wishing

1161
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So does this make you want it even more?

1162
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah

1163
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
What do you think

1164
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Is going to be the coolest thing

1165
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
About everything that came out of GDC?

1166
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What are you looking forward to doing with

1167
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Home or with LittleBigPlanet?

1168
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I thought Home was a

1169
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Very good idea

1170
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The only thing I want to do is stream porn from my hard drive

1171
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
To my TV

1172
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You can kind of do that anyway

1173
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I don't know about the hard drive on your computer

1174
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I think you can stream the movies on your TV

1175
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But I'm looking at some FAQs

1176
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
That came out about it

1177
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
One of the questions that was posed about Playstation Home

1178
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Can I launch and watch a

1179
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
BD movie from within Home?

1180
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Launch yes, watch no

1181
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I think some people were thinking that you would be able to put

1182
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
A porno on the TV in your apartment

1183
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And that would play

1184
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Well you could go to that and launch the movie

1185
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But it won't actually play the porno in your apartment

1186
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
At least that's the impression I'm getting

1187
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Which seems, the logistics of that seems like it would be

1188
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
A real bandwidth eater anyway

1189
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So it's probably for the best, right?

1190
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I got bandwidth

1191
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I think it will actually stream whatever it is

1192
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
On that TV because they said they had dynamic

1193
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Well, I forget if it was like

1194
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Dynamic sound or something like that where

1195
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
As you walk closer to the source it will get louder

1196
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And that kind of thing

1197
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What do you think should be

1198
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Sony's next move, Raven's Dolphin?

1199
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
What should they do at E3?

1200
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I don't know

1201
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I think they should definitely put Home

1202
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
In a good response but I definitely agree

1203
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That any games

1204
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Like to support the Home

1205
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
More games that support Home would be a home run

1206
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So maybe some games that incorporate the Home thing

1207
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Because one thing that's interesting about what Sony

1208
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Is doing versus what Microsoft is doing

1209
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Is Microsoft requires developers

1210
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
To put achievements in the games

1211
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Sony is just kind of letting it be there

1212
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And if the developers want to

1213
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Put things in it then great

1214
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
If when you beat Final Fantasy 13

1215
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Let's say if Square wants to

1216
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Give you a little cloud sword

1217
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Even though cloud's not in Final Fantasy 13

1218
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I don't know, humor me here for a minute

1219
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
A little cloud sword that you could put in your PlayStation Home

1220
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
That would be up to them completely

1221
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So kind of interesting

1222
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, two more things

1223
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Alright, hurry

1224
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You have to buy a Bluetooth headset and a USB

1225
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Are you?

1226
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I already have one for my 360

1227
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's going to be a tough sell on Sony

1228
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Sony will need to tell me why I need it

1229
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Okay, and

1230
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The next thing about the trophies

1231
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Did you see that room?

1232
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I saw some of the videos

1233
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It looked like one room had a crap load of trophies

1234
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Maybe from all the arcade titles

1235
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I don't know

1236
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And one thing from Second Life

1237
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Am I going to launch pink dicks at people

1238
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
That I don't like?

1239
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I have a feeling since this community is going to be a little more moderated

1240
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Probably not

1241
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
With Second Life you can kind of user create things

1242
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I haven't done a lot of Second Life

1243
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
But there's more user creation in that

1244
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I don't think you really get that so much here

1245
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You get user customization

1246
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But not so much creation

1247
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Alright, thanks so much for the call Ravenstaufen

1248
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You're welcome

1249
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Alright, we'll take one more call and some feedback with the Sony stuff

1250
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
1877 Game OLR

1251
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio

1252
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Over on Skype

1253
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Of course we encourage you guys to interact with our program

1254
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That's what we're here for

1255
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
We're just three folks that like video games

1256
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Just like the rest of you

1257
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
We want to hear what you guys have to say as well

1258
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Let's take another call

1259
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1260
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Hey, it's SSJ100Matt

1261
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Hi SSJ100Matt, what do you think about this whole Sony home thing?

1262
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Actually, I'm liking it a lot

1263
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You're liking it a lot?

1264
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Were you somebody that wanted a Playstation 3 before Game Developers Conference?

1265
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I actually know originally I was split between a 360 and a PS3

1266
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So what do you think now?

1267
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Well now I've got to start thinking about the PS3 now

1268
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Before I was like majority 360

1269
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Now I'm back in the middle

1270
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So I'm going to wait until this home thing picks up around October

1271
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
And then I'll make a decision

1272
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
What about home that puts you back in the middle with all this?

1273
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Originally I used to play The Sims a lot

1274
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That was basically my guilty pleasure

1275
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
That thing was like crack

1276
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
This is kind of like The Sims

1277
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I know I'm going to be on this thing customizing buying crap

1278
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
To make my place look good

1279
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Speaking of customizing LittleBigPlanet

1280
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Is that something that appeals to you?

1281
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It looks really nice, I think it will be great

1282
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Because I think they said something that they're going to come out with a full version

1283
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Where it's just going to basically be user created courses

1284
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And bring that out in retail or something

1285
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I think it's going to be very interesting to see how that plays out

1286
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
When it's actually out there on the marketplace

1287
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Because now it seems like Sony is starting to listen to people

1288
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And they're going to be more welcome to user created things

1289
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Thanks so much for the call SSJ100 Matt

1290
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
We've got to get back to the news

1291
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But take care

1292
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Take it easy

1293
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
We'd love to take more calls

1294
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
But we will take calls later in the show during part B

1295
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And if you want to talk about Sony home at that time

1296
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Certainly you can

1297
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But we need to get back into some news, right Jamie?

1298
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Yeah, news would be a good thing

1299
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I need to cleanse the palette of Sony

1300
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I sense a little bitterness about Sony within you

1301
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
The bitterness is strong with this one

1302
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It always has been

1303
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But speaking of things that are a little less bitter

1304
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Is that in Fable 2, which will be coming out

1305
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You can have a dog

1306
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And he walks around with you

1307
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And he growls when he smells the people sneaking up on you

1308
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And you can't really tell him what to do

1309
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But you can gesture to him and he'll learn to follow

1310
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Well, he'll always follow you

1311
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But he'll go along with you and be your puppy

1312
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And lick your face and eat your chickens

1313
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And that type of thing

1314
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Wait, he'll eat your chickens?

1315
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I don't know

1316
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
That's not good

1317
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Do the chickens fight back like they did in Zelda?

1318
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I don't know

1319
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
But I wish they had cats

1320
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
That was kind of disappointing

1321
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Because I'm more of a cat person

1322
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But then again I suppose the cat would control you

1323
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Apparently you can also be a pregnant woman

1324
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And catch diseases

1325
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You can get knocked up within Fable 2?

1326
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You can have sex, you can have unprotected sex

1327
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And protected sex, you can get STDs

1328
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
That's making the fantasy out of my game

1329
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
How many different kinds of sex can you have?

1330
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Is there going to be a whole Kama Sutra?

1331
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Hot Monkey

1332
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Will butt sex be involved?

1333
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
They had gay relationships in the first game

1334
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Butt sex is not just a gay thing

1335
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Well, that's true

1336
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Good point

1337
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
The dog is pretty awesome

1338
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
They're saying that you're actually going to care for this dog

1339
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It loves you

1340
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And it will try to keep you safe

1341
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And stuff like that

1342
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's pretty cool

1343
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
They have some videos on gamevideos.com

1344
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Basically talking about the whole dog aspect of the game

1345
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It just looks awesome, I really want it

1346
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It's way better than in 10 Dogs

1347
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
DDRDollarBill says

1348
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I want to have sex without E-Herpes

1349
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And DDRDollarBill says

1350
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Surprise butt sex?

1351
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I guess that's something you could do in the game

1352
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Surprise butt sex on people

1353
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I don't know, probably not

1354
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I just don't know

1355
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
If I were going to have something useful I'd have a pet wolf

1356
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
SSJ100Matt says

1357
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Do we get extra points for donkey punching?

1358
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I want a pit bull

1359
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And NM64 says

1360
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Everyone has AIDS

1361
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Because if you're allowed to run around and have unprotected sex in the game

1362
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That's the likely conclusion

1363
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I wonder if you could start an epidemic in the game

1364
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It's kind of weird

1365
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But I suppose this answers the question now about

1366
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
What was the big secret about Fable?

1367
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It was puppy dogs and diseases

1368
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I guess so, there you have it

1369
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
DDRDollarBill says

1370
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You're going to have to buy your condoms with your MS points

1371
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
That's funny

1372
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Little microtransactions out the wazoo

1373
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah, maybe you'll be able to get a cat

1374
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But you'll have to pay some points for it, I don't know

1375
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Alright

1376
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Well, there was

1377
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You have to change the litter or you die of methane poisoning

1378
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
There were some other announcements that came out of Game Developers Conference

1379
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And I love me some Mizuguchi

1380
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Of course Mizuguchi, the fine fellow who created Rez

1381
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I believe Space Channel 5

1382
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Luminous

1383
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Meteos

1384
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Some of the greatest games, 99 Nights, not so much

1385
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Feeling the love there

1386
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
But everybody's allowed to make a mistake

1387
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Well, this Make No Mistake here

1388
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Every Xtend Xtra Xtreme is coming to Xbox Live Arcade

1389
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And it looks like the audio and visual sex capade

1390
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That you would be expecting from Mizuguchi

1391
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I mean, just kind of look at these screenshots here

1392
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Of course, every Xtend Xtra was a game that was out on the PSP

1393
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
They're going to be making this version as well for Xbox Live Arcade

1394
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And of course they're calling it E4 for short

1395
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Because every Xtend Xtra Xtreme get it, there's all the Es there

1396
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They're going to be able to battle others in an online versus mode

1397
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And that's kind of something that's a little new there for Xbox Live

1398
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Of course, just look at how trippy that looks

1399
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I mean, this is going to be an amazing seizure playable game

1400
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
But I really like every Xtend Xtra on the PSP

1401
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's kind of a unique sort of game

1402
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It's not really a puzzle

1403
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's like a

1404
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I mean, it has puzzle elements

1405
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
You have to think about what you're doing

1406
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
But it is kind of an action game

1407
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So it's unique

1408
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And I'm a big supporter of unique games

1409
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So this is a perfect announcement for Game Developers Conference

1410
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So check that out on Xbox Live Marketplace

1411
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
When it becomes available

1412
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Probably later this year

1413
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
At least as far as we know

1414
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Yeah, late later this year

1415
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Christmas

1416
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Christmas

1417
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Anyways, one thing though that's making games like this possible

1418
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Is the fact that Microsoft has officially raised the file limit

1419
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Of the Xbox Live Arcade games

1420
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Originally it was 50 megabytes

1421
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
To fit on that wonderful 64 megabyte memory unit

1422
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Of course, now that they've also announced a larger memory unit

1423
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Which is going to be 512 megabytes

1424
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Now they can have games that are even bigger

1425
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Including games up to 150 megabytes

1426
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And even higher with permission

1427
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So that's excellent

1428
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And I know one of the first games to actually utilize that

1429
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Was going to be Symphony of the Night

1430
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Because I think that was like 98 megabytes

1431
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah, that's when these rumors started

1432
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Because of Castlevania

1433
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I had thought that Microsoft already confirmed this

1434
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So I was kind of surprised to see this making the rounds on news sites again

1435
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Well, they sort of confirmed it

1436
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And then they made a press release about it

1437
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So now it's official official

1438
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
These stages of gaming news

1439
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Especially Microsoft gaming news

1440
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Because Microsoft news always starts out as a rumor first

1441
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Because Microsoft rumors 99% of the time are true

1442
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So there's a Microsoft rumor

1443
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And then it evolves into random dude at Microsoft

1444
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Or a Microsoft blogger said, yeah, we're working on it, shh, don't tell

1445
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And then it evolves into like a press release

1446
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And then it's like, oh, it's official now

1447
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Microsoft has said, hail the larger Xbox Live arcade games

1448
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm sure every XtendXtra will benefit from that 150 megabytes

1449
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Here's the other thing I want to know though

1450
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Now that the arcade limit has been upped

1451
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Mr. Mizuguchi and everybody over at Q Entertainment

1452
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Whatever happened

1453
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's been like a year now, whatever happened to Madonna in Luminous?

1454
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And I'm not just saying Madonna specifically

1455
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Contrary to popular belief, I could give two shits about Madonna

1456
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
But I'm talking about the licensed music in general

1457
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
We got one song, Heavenly Star, which was an in-house thing anyway

1458
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Where's the rest of the content that's supposed to be in Luminous?

1459
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
No content for you

1460
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I guess not

1461
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Sorry, I got on a tangent there

1462
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
This is supposed to be about the thing

1463
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Talking about Mizuguchi made me think about that

1464
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
What the hell ever happened to Madonna, etc.

1465
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
The puppy ate it

1466
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I guess so, the dog ate it

1467
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Well, you know something that you don't really have to worry about

1468
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Well, I don't know, I'm sort of worried about this

1469
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Peter Jackson is doing some episodic content for a couple of Xbox 360 games

1470
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And one of them is Halo

1471
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And I'm wondering, dude, what's he going to do for Halo?

1472
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That'd be very interesting

1473
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
There's not too many details about it

1474
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And I don't think anything on what the other game is

1475
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It looks like it's still in development

1476
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But I don't know, is it going to involve giant monkeys?

1477
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Well, if you know Peter Jackson is doing it, you know it's going to be long

1478
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Like three and a half hour, butt-numbingly long

1479
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Like certain movies that he's made

1480
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
In fact, most all the movies he's made in the past few years

1481
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
God, seriously

1482
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Don't get me wrong, Lord of the Rings is cool and all

1483
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But damn, those are some long movies

1484
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It seems like episodic content has become this real buzzword of the past couple of years, hasn't it?

1485
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It seems like everybody and their mom is doing episodic content

1486
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
What could they really do for Halo episodic content, you think?

1487
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Do you think this is something they'll do like two and then say, oh, there was your episodic content?

1488
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Or is this something you could see actually going on for a while?

1489
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I mean, God, if any community could support something like this though

1490
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
The Halo community is huge and loud

1491
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I would see this happening like after Halo 3

1492
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And it would be for Halo 3, not its own game

1493
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Just like additional story, single player stuff

1494
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Or co-op missions or stuff like that

1495
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It's kind of similar to the co-op missions in Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

1496
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Or something like that

1497
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It's not really episodic content, it's just downloadable content later on

1498
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Because to be honest, there aren't that many episodic content games out there

1499
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I mean, even Half-Life or whatever

1500
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
They're only up to episode two and two hasn't even come out yet

1501
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
You know I'm going to say Sam and Max

1502
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Sam and Max, yeah, that's one that's actually pretty good

1503
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But what else besides that?

1504
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I agree, Sam and Max is the only ones that seem to be doing it right

1505
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It's a buzzword thrown out there a lot and it's not being done

1506
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I mean, it's just like digital distribution for movies and stuff

1507
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Everyone talks about it, but it's hardly done

1508
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
We've got to check in with the chat room because there are some funnies

1509
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Of course, going back to me bitching about the whole Luminous thing

1510
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Joshi16 kind of combined the stories together and says

1511
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Madonna would give you the Herpes achievement, Sky

1512
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So insinuating that maybe Madonna will actually be in Fable

1513
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
To give you the STDs that you can get inside the game

1514
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So that's certainly an interesting thought from Joshi16

1515
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Let's see, Lazer is a winner for this reference

1516
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Maybe the Dingo ate your content

1517
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Ahh!

1518
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Now I'm getting all Meryl Streep

1519
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
The Dingo ate the baby!

1520
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Anyway, let's see

1521
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You're so a winner for that comment

1522
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
What else was there about episodic content?

1523
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I thought it was very interesting here in chat room

1524
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Well, Firesafety says there are already giant monkeys in Halo

1525
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So I guess you can't really say that that's what Peter Jackson is going to bring to the table

1526
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Let's see

1527
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Firesafety also says hopefully it's nothing like Half-Life 2 periodic

1528
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
yearly maybe content

1529
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Funnydale says episodic content equals 3 hour games every year

1530
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Yep, that's basically what it's been so far

1531
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So I'm hoping Halo will break that mold

1532
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
We'll see

1533
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Well, this is not a happy story here

1534
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But some news came out about Castle Crashers

1535
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Loki, you were all excited about Castle Crashers

1536
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Because this is the game that kind of looks like

1537
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It looks like an old school arcade

1538
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Hit the buttons, hack and slash type thing

1539
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Like a brand new one, this looks awesome

1540
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Well, when approached

1541
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Behemoth's Dan Paladin

1542
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
They won actually an IGF award

1543
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Dan Paladin actually commented on the game

1544
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
He noted that the Xbox Live title still had

1545
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
About a year of development left

1546
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Meaning the Castle Crashers

1547
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Looks like it will now be out in 2008

1548
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But now the good news about this is that since the size limit has been increased

1549
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
One reason that's been kind of a conclusion

1550
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
That's been jumped to over this is that

1551
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Oh, they're going to go back and make the game bigger

1552
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Thanks to the size increase

1553
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So maybe good things will come to those who wait in terms of what's there

1554
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So I know you were really anxious about this game, Loki

1555
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Are you okay with this delay if it's going to make the game better?

1556
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Are you pissed?

1557
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Do you wish they just released something now and maybe do a Castle Crashers 2?

1558
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Oh, I'm fine with them delaying the game

1559
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Most likely even if it wasn't because of this

1560
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It would be delayed for some other reason

1561
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I mean, who cares?

1562
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
There's supposedly more content coming out now

1563
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So I'm fine holding off on that

1564
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I mean, it's one of those games that look neat

1565
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I wasn't like, oh, I gotta have this now

1566
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I mean, big deal

1567
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I don't know, I can wait

1568
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Alright

1569
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Well, I don't know

1570
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
But game delays, they kind of get me a little bit angsty

1571
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but you know

1572
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Anytime a game I look forward to gets delayed

1573
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Whether it be for the right reason or not

1574
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I get a little pissed off

1575
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
What about you?

1576
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Um, sometimes

1577
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So that means that because we're pissed off

1578
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Well, this is one of those times, DarkSakura

1579
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Help me out here, because we got a segue

1580
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Roar!

1581
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Thank you, and to the FUs of the Week

1582
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Music

1583
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
My FU of the Week is, as usual, traffic-based

1584
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Fuck you to men with small penises who drive big trucks

1585
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And also fuck you to sacramoms who drive SUVs

1586
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I leave it at that

1587
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Moki!

1588
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Fuck the fact that I can't find two files for Pop Station

1589
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
For the PSP

1590
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And those are two important files that I need to make things work

1591
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I did find, however, though, there is one game that I have

1592
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
That I really should put on my PSP

1593
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And that is Einhendr

1594
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Because that would be fucking awesome

1595
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That's it

1596
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Alright

1597
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I didn't have really anything that

1598
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Oh, fuck to the fact that this room is like a scorching

1599
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I don't know

1600
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I think somebody turned the fan off

1601
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I'm gonna go check that

1602
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It's like fucking hot in here

1603
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It is

1604
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It's just me

1605
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
No, I know

1606
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm bringing them here too

1607
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I'll go look at the temperature in a minute

1608
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
But I want to say my FU of the Week would go to

1609
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Daylight Savings Time

1610
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Oh my god

1611
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Ugh, I hate Daylight Savings Time

1612
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
How dare you rob me of an hour of my sleep

1613
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I don't care if there's farmer kids with school

1614
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Or whatever the hell reason they say

1615
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Energy consumption

1616
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Whatever the hell excuse they have

1617
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
FU Daylight Savings Time

1618
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm dying of fire

1619
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Hey, that was a pretty short FUs of the Week segment

1620
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I'm kind of sad a little bit

1621
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Well, don't be sad

1622
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Anyways

1623
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
There's one reason you shouldn't be sad

1624
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Xbox Live hit six million users

1625
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
They apparently did this four months earlier than they had expected

1626
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And not a big surprise

1627
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Because, you know, they offer those two day subscriptions

1628
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And pretty much anyone that plugs in

1629
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You know, their console into the internet

1630
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
They are logged into Xbox Live

1631
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
So, and they didn't really say what the six million mark meant

1632
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I mean, whether that's going to be silver or gold or whatever

1633
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Um, I don't know

1634
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
So, take it with a grain of salt

1635
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But yay, there's lots of people on live

1636
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That's all you need to know, I guess

1637
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
More people to flash us their ass, you know

1638
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
On the camera

1639
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Hooray

1640
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yay ass

1641
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Speaking of which, how have you noticed?

1642
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
The camera for the 360

1643
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Completely useless, like the iToy

1644
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I have kind of noticed

1645
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
What about Rayman Raving Rabbids on the 360?

1646
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh, I'm guessing that's going to be about as good as any iToy game

1647
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
That's a damn good point

1648
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
When was the last time anyone said anything about the Xbox Live camera?

1649
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And why is it we haven't gotten more games like Uno?

1650
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
You would think, based on the success of Uno

1651
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That we would have seen like, you know, we would see like Old Maid

1652
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And like freaking Skip Bow

1653
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
And I don't know, whatever else card games and casual games they can come up with

1654
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
On Xbox Live by now

1655
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Is it just a rights thing? I don't know

1656
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It's lame

1657
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Well

1658
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
There are though some things that are not quite as lame as that

1659
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Although there's not many things that are really as lame as that

1660
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Um

1661
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Some news for our European listeners though

1662
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
You know, we've been talking about Blue Dragon

1663
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It's going to be released in very likely September in Europe

1664
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
As was announced at a game developers conference

1665
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Isn't that cool?

1666
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And I'm thinking that I've actually been really excited about this

1667
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
You know

1668
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I mean, I'm still sort of back and forth

1669
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
But we have to wait until August to get it

1670
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And so I think by then I'll decide whether or not I really am going to be able to dedicate the time to another RPG

1671
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I think it's going to be awesome

1672
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I think there were a couple more details on Blue Dragon this week

1673
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Because I thought about, Loki, you said

1674
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Already on this show like a month ago that Blue Dragon was coming out over here

1675
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I think you might have said July

1676
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
But whatever, it got delayed a couple weeks, big whoop, right?

1677
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
But we all knew it was coming over here

1678
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But I seem to remember one cool thing that I remember reading about Blue Dragon

1679
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Is that they're going to have both the English language and Japanese language tracks in it

1680
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Kind of like how Enchanted Arms had

1681
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
So if you're one of those people that's like, I hate it when they dub this stuff in English

1682
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Because blah blah blah blah blah

1683
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Then fine, you can watch the Japanese stuff with subtitles

1684
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Everyone's happy

1685
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So I'm actually really looking forward to Blue Dragon

1686
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Just because, you know, how could you not be?

1687
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
It's, you know, the team that made the original Final Fantasy

1688
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Kind of, I don't know

1689
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm very excited about it

1690
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Looking at chat room to see what's going on there in chat

1691
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Let's see

1692
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Joshi16 will not let the Madonna thing go

1693
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Because Joshi says Madonna needs a live arcade camera game

1694
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Dude, you need to get your issues worked out there with Madonna

1695
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Let's see, what else do we have here?

1696
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Blaze says simply fuck the Xbox Live camera

1697
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
There you have it

1698
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Mori agrees, Xbox 360 skip bow would be amazing

1699
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
You know what would be more amazing than Xbox 360 skip bow?

1700
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And props to you if you know this game

1701
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I might be horribly pronouncing it because it's French

1702
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
But this is like my favorite card game ever

1703
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Xbox 360 Millborn

1704
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
You ever played that game?

1705
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
With the roll and stop and punctured tires

1706
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It's like a racing card game

1707
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
No

1708
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Oh my god, it's the best game ever

1709
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I love that card game

1710
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Bring me my Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade

1711
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Sorry

1712
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I'm ranting tonight

1713
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm a demanding little bitch tonight

1714
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm sorry

1715
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I'll be good

1716
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Alright

1717
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Oh I'm sorry, we got a release date to talk about

1718
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Wow

1719
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Live Radio

1720
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
See I get all ranty and then I completely forget about talking about release dates

1721
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But I suppose we should talk about the Japanese release dates

1722
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Because these are usually the things that we're going to see over here in the US before too long

1723
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Or over in Europe as well

1724
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Well coming out on the Xbox 360, not a lot

1725
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Except some games are going into the Platinum Collection on March 15th

1726
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So you can now get Battlefield 2, Burnout, Chrome Hounds, Perfect Dark Zero

1727
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
All at a lower price over in Japan

1728
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, you get G.I. Jockey Wii is coming out

1729
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Sonic 2 Himitsu Ring is coming out on March 15th

1730
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
That would just be Sonic and the Secret Rings

1731
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
SpongeBob SquarePants also making its way to Japanese audiences also on March 15th

1732
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
We're sorry Japan

1733
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah, sorry Japan for that

1734
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Sometimes things from our culture will stink up your things

1735
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
On the Playstation 3, Fight Night Round 3 making its way to Japan on March 15th

1736
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
As well as a game called Dust Cap 3

1737
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I don't know about you, but I've never heard of Dust Cap 3

1738
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That's not a game, that's why

1739
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Wow, I need help tonight

1740
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Dust Cap 3 is just an accessory

1741
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Because I was like, whatever happened to Dust Cap 3?

1742
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I was like, what the hell is Dust Cap 1 and 2?

1743
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Sounds like the name of some weird RPG or puzzle game

1744
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I've never heard of Dust Cap 1 and 2, apparently Dust Cap 3 is literally that

1745
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Yeah, forget it

1746
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Also coming out

1747
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Let's not submit this show for podcast award consideration

1748
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Because it's just not that good tonight and it's all my fault, I'm sorry

1749
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Coming out on the Playstation 2

1750
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Konjiki no Kouda 2 is coming out, also from Koei

1751
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Big week for Koei Entertainment

1752
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
A game that's going into best hits, I love this title

1753
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Princess Maker 4 is coming out

1754
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So if you've ever wanted to be your own princess

1755
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Now you can for a much lower price

1756
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I don't think that's exactly what that's about

1757
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's called Princess Maker 4

1758
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Look at the box art

1759
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Doesn't that look like princesses?

1760
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Having a good time there?

1761
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Look at the description

1762
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Princess Maker 4 is the fourth installment of the popular promotion simulation game

1763
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
In which you become the father guardian of a young girl

1764
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
You must raise her to become a princess in eight years

1765
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
See? It is Princess Maker

1766
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
STFU, you don't know what you're talking about

1767
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Anyways

1768
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Wait, I have more

1769
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Dust Cap 4 is coming out in 2008, look for it

1770
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
No, on Nintendo DS real quick

1771
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Bionicle Heroes, the Konami Arcade Collection is coming out over there in Japan

1772
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Also, Kuro Kuro Princess

1773
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And Lost in Blue 2 is coming out on March 15th as well

1774
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
And Fingerprint Guard Film Light

1775
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I love that one

1776
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Just kidding, I knew that wasn't a game

1777
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Alright, I'm done

1778
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Anyways, US, pretty much as far as games go

1779
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
There's really one big one this week

1780
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And that would be God of War 2

1781
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Coming out in PlayStation 2

1782
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
PSP is not seeing much else either

1783
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Call of Duty 3 Road to Victory

1784
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
That's going to be coming out as well this week

1785
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
The 360, we're just getting a re-release of Call of Duty 3

1786
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
The Gold Edition, now with downloadable maps

1787
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Actually included in there, I believe you get tokens for that

1788
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And some special behind the scenes DVD or something

1789
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Lame

1790
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
For the PlayStation 3, you're getting College Hoops 2K7

1791
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Hooray

1792
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And let's see

1793
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
For PC, quite a bit of stuff coming out

1794
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
None of it looks very good though

1795
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Some highlights, the Top Spin 2 is coming to the PC

1796
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Battlefield 2 complete

1797
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And the rest sucks

1798
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
For the Wii, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07

1799
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Get your golf on, and then for the DS

1800
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You have Mind Quiz

1801
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And that's another ripoff of Brain Age

1802
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Can I say another game I played this week real quick?

1803
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I played Quiz and Dragons with Bobby Blackwolf

1804
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And we were so horrible at that game

1805
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Words cannot describe the handicap we will need on future games of Quiz and Dragons

1806
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Which is now on UltraCade apparently

1807
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Even though UltraCade, you know, we're a little meh

1808
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But yeah, Quiz and Dragons will own you

1809
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Herbie Rescue Rally DS

1810
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Which is a port of a crappy movie

1811
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Made into a crappy game

1812
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Now on the DS

1813
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And it looks crappy

1814
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
That's it

1815
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I just have to say real quick, sorry chat

1816
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
No Rob

1817
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It's chat, it's chat

1818
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
The chat room was making fun of my fuck up earlier

1819
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
DarkTetsuya says dustcap 3, dustcap's revenge

1820
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Fireoboma says dustcap 3 gets more incredible

1821
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And Illusion makes the mandatory dustcap 3 electric boogaloo

1822
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
That would be dustcap 2

1823
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Anyway, how about our European releases?

1824
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
How about it?

1825
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
A Bunch of Crap on the 16th

1826
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Yeah, maybe some of it's kind of crap, some of it's kind of cool

1827
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
We have Call of Duty 3, Championship Manager 2007

1828
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Free Running, Legend of the Dragon

1829
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Lunar Knights, Vampire Hunters, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, Justice For All

1830
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Puzzle Quest, Challenge of the Warlords

1831
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Rayman Raving Ravids

1832
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Rome Total War, Saint Seiya the Hades

1833
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Samurai Warriors 2 Empires

1834
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Spectrobes, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on DS

1835
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Test Drive Unlimited, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07

1836
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And UFO Extraterrestrials

1837
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And also coming out this week in Europe

1838
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Sorry guys, you're only going to get dustcap 2

1839
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Because you always get screwed on the release dates and having to wait for things

1840
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But enjoy dustcap 2, we have been for the last 3 years

1841
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Sound fair?

1842
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Very fair

1843
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
We love you overseas listeners, we really do

1844
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Well another love affair that's going on right now is Electronic Arts and Harmonics

1845
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And it was just a real brief thing that came out, was leaked to the media this week

1846
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That Electronic Arts announced they have penned a deal with MTV Networks and Harmonics

1847
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
To publish Harmonics' next game

1848
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
However what that game is, is a secret for now

1849
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So it's interesting though because obviously Guitar Hero was something that Red Octane published

1850
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
But now EA is going to be filling that role for whatever Harmonics' next game is

1851
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I seem to remember previously said, and it looks like this article makes reference to it too

1852
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Harmonics once said that Guitar Hero is just the tip of the iceberg, just the beginning of what these games can become

1853
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And I seem to remember Harmonics saying that their next project was way bigger than Guitar Hero

1854
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Like a real thing

1855
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And a lot of people speculated it's going to be a game that really teaches you how to play guitar

1856
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I don't know

1857
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I'm still waiting for Sax Maniacs

1858
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I kind of wish they'd bring back the Amplitude thing in some new evolved regard

1859
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Because I did love me some Amplitude

1860
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
They could evolve the game, make it next gen somehow, a little more competitive

1861
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Crackin' DJ over here

1862
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Crackin' DJ was not even a Harmonics, that was a Sega game

1863
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I don't care, it's still fun

1864
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Crackin' DJ, I haven't heard that in years

1865
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
At least Crackin' DJ sort of made you feel like you were actually remixing stuff

1866
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Because you were going through the same motions as an actual DJ would

1867
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
So that was kind of neat

1868
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And I will be kickbanning users in chatroom who said that the game Harmonics is making is Dustcat 4

1869
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Let the joke die you assholes

1870
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I think we have the start of a brand new joke to beat into the ground

1871
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Dustcat 4 bust a cap

1872
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I saw that in there, that was funny

1873
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Ha ha ha

1874
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Anyways, so more EA news of course

1875
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,000
They are kicking off an online music competition featuring singing sensation Lily Ellen

1876
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Who the fuck that is?

1877
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I am not hip to these artists out there

1878
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Anyways, apparently Lily Ellen, they are doing, I guess this is coincidentally

1879
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Let me just put this in perspective for people

1880
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
If the music doesn't sound like

1881
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Puch pooch meow meow meow meow

1882
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Puch pooch meow meow meow

1883
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Then Loki doesn't listen to it

1884
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
If it's not cat techno, it's not for me

1885
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
So, anyways

1886
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Apparently she is doing a version of her song, Smile, for Sims 2

1887
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Which is going to be in Simlish, which makes it sound even more retarded

1888
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
So, very excellent

1889
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Just so you know, Lily Allen is a newer artist who has recently peaked at the number 2 position in the UK

1890
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
With her single, Alright, Still

1891
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And it actually peaked at number 20 here in the US

1892
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And that is who Lily Allen is

1893
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And I've seen this, I've probably heard this song before

1894
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Don't make me pull up a clip

1895
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
To which I would say, alright, still don't care

1896
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So, but if you do win this contest though

1897
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
You will be winning a prize package worth approximately $1,390

1898
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:09,000
And have a chance to record a song in Simlish for possible inclusion in a future Sims 2 game

1899
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
So, great, you get to sing a song in gibberish that's going to appear in a game

1900
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
That probably no one will actually pay attention to the music

1901
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
That sounds awesome

1902
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I want to sing a song in gibberish

1903
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
That's my song, Lily Allen, are you listening?

1904
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
You could totally sample me on your next record

1905
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Isn't that like the Strong Bad Lights which rave all of a sudden?

1906
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So, how about SingStar?

1907
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Oh, yay, there's another thing I'm looking forward to on the Playstation 3

1908
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Well, we are having, for SingStar there's going to be a release in the US in fall

1909
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It's going to be early June in the UK

1910
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And they are going to be doing this thing called Game 3.0

1911
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
It's a very interesting thing

1912
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Basically, you're going to be able to download new content

1913
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
But upload content as well using your USB camera

1914
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
You can record videos

1915
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And then everyone will look at it

1916
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Like a Numa Numa kid or something

1917
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Dear God who is in heaven, please listen to this boy's prayer

1918
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I've been a very good Rob this whole year long

1919
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Please, please, please God Almighty who art in heaven

1920
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Please, please make Loki get really drunk one night

1921
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
And record some videos on SingStar

1922
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And upload them to this Game 3.0 service

1923
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So that the entirety of the internet can download and make fun of him

1924
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Thank you, amen

1925
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
What?

1926
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
God doesn't listen to you

1927
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Come on, Loki, you know you want to do it

1928
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
No, you want me to do that

1929
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I do

1930
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I don't want to do that at all

1931
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I am not touching that fucking game

1932
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Karaoke will not be entering my house

1933
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Fuck that shit

1934
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
GS68 says

1935
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I don't know, it makes me think of a Caturday macro

1936
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It says, I'm in your OLRs, drunk in your hosts

1937
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Maybe that's God speaking

1938
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
We all know we're all going to hell

1939
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Probably

1940
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Except not me because I don't believe in hell

1941
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
We're going to wherever pagan people go

1942
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Let's not turn this into a religious

1943
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
We're not a God cast

1944
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Go look up God cast in iTunes if you want religious stuff

1945
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
We've got to talk about games

1946
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
And one game that we'll talk about here is Warhawk

1947
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It's interesting because Warhawk went that it was going to be downloadable only when it went over to the Playstation 3

1948
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Here's the other thing you need to know

1949
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Warhawk is not going to be single player now

1950
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
It's going to be a multiplayer only battle arena

1951
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Since the game has moved into the Playstation Network

1952
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
It's a downloadable title

1953
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
It's only going to be something that you can play online

1954
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
But the cool news is that you don't get to just do planes

1955
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
You can do jeeps, tanks, infantry units, and the whole works there

1956
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
So you need to get some other online modes as well

1957
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
But if you don't like to play online games, too bad

1958
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Warhawk will not be for you on the Playstation 3

1959
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
It's just like Star Fox 64

1960
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It's like Star Fox is all about flying

1961
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Now I have to run around and I have tanks and shit

1962
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Why can't it just be about the flying?

1963
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Eh, whatever

1964
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Anyways

1965
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
So when you think about high end computer systems, you probably don't think of Commodore

1966
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
But they're hoping to change that

1967
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Because now they are back and they are trying to make a name for themselves

1968
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
If the year was 1984, I would be thinking about Commodore

1969
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Because the Commodore 64 was my first gaming platform, really truly

1970
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Commodore 64 is an amazing piece of machinery

1971
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Amen

1972
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
So yeah, now they're launching a new Commodore PC

1973
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Geared for PC gaming, and it's supposed to launch at Germany's SeeBit show

1974
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Actually this week, March 15th

1975
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I don't know

1976
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
They're basically saying that's going to provide what gamers need and want

1977
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Excellent

1978
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Can I play Last Ninja on it, yes or no?

1979
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Better

1980
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Because if not, there's going to be one hell of a syntax error coming out of this angry gamer

1981
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
That was a Commodore joke

1982
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Don't laugh at once

1983
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Yeah, that's why no one got it

1984
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
That's why we're on the internet, boys and girls

1985
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Not satellite radio or the real deal

1986
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Maybe we should call ourselves Video Obscura

1987
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
That'd be an awesome name

1988
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
That's actually not a bad name for a podcast

1989
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
At least Video Game Obscura

1990
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
At least people would know we're a video game podcast as opposed to when people go

1991
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
What the hell is Orange Lounge Radio?

1992
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Are you guys a lounge music podcast?

1993
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah, we just had Richard Cheeze on last week

1994
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Speaking of cheese

1995
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:46,000
There is a Lego MMO that is in development coming in 2008

1996
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It's being developed by NetDevil for auto assault

1997
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You go around building stuff and talking with people

1998
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
It's just an MMO with Legos

1999
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It's for kids, but I love Legos so I'm probably going to play it

2000
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I love Legos too

2001
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I remember when you tried to make the charging cradle out of Legos

2002
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I did make a charging cradle

2003
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Speaking of which, I broke the charging cradle this week

2004
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Because Nelly wanted to play Elite Beat Agents

2005
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Because she's been playing that game now

2006
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I had to rip the cable out because it doesn't work very well plugged into the

2007
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
For those that didn't hear the shows a while back

2008
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Loki actually built a DS charger out of Legos

2009
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So it was like a docking bay

2010
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
He built one out of Legos

2011
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I like Legos too

2012
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Actual Legos

2013
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Not so much all these games

2014
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I measure my Legos in gallons now

2015
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And I still have 10 gallons of Legos in my closet

2016
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Let's build the next OLR studio out of Legos

2017
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
We don't have enough Legos for that

2018
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I did one time build something

2019
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I used to have this desk that stretched one whole wall on my room

2020
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:03,000
And I used every single Lego to build one giant, like, base thing or something

2021
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It's just like a really cool, like, I don't know

2022
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
You remember Classic Gaming Expo though

2023
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Where they built the Space Invaders thing out of Legos

2024
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Hey, is Classic Gaming Expo coming back this year?

2025
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I heard they were going to be in Vegas this year

2026
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
They're supposed to do, I think, the 10th anniversary

2027
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I want to go, I want to go, Jamie, let's go

2028
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But I'm going to something else

2029
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I'm going to Pinagogo

2030
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I heard a rumor you were going to

2031
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I don't know if I can say it on air, but

2032
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Yes, I'm planning on, if I can at all manage it

2033
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I'm going to be going to Dragon Con

2034
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Okay, she said I didn't

2035
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I want to go to be there at the podcasters panel

2036
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Just, you know, right now it's like

2037
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
How am I going to afford that?

2038
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
But, you know, I'm working on it

2039
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I played Monopoly Pinball

2040
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And I was actually kicking ass over at Sunnyvale Golf Land yesterday

2041
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
What the fuck does that have to do with anything Dragon Con?

2042
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
She mentioned pinball

2043
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Pinagogo

2044
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It's going to be a hard time

2045
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I don't know if I told, you know, everybody

2046
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
But we did get a new machine

2047
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And we got a bride of pin-bot

2048
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And we are actually

2049
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Dan has my Rocky and Bullwinkle working now

2050
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Which makes me intensely happy

2051
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And our Guns N' Roses is now for sale

2052
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Aww

2053
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Will you sell it to someone on the internets?

2054
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Oh, but shipping would be an arm and a leg

2055
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
If they live in the area

2056
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Or want to come pick it up

2057
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And pay us a lot of money for it

2058
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Then I don't think we have a lot

2059
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Define a lot

2060
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
How much are you selling the Guns N' Roses for?

2061
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I don't know, it's up to Dan

2062
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
He actually may have a trade worked out on it

2063
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
But I think we are also selling our Johnny Mnemonic

2064
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It's a good pin, but I hate Johnny Mnemonic

2065
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
You should let us know some prices

2066
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Well, I'll talk to the hubby and see

2067
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
If he wants me to use our independent

2068
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Non-corporate sponsored podcast

2069
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
To sell my pinball machine

2070
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Why not? You got to get something out of this deal

2071
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Seriously

2072
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Alright, well something else you can do

2073
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
If you love Orange Launch Radio

2074
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
We'll give some cheap plugs

2075
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
For some of our other stuff right now

2076
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
You can always leave us a review on iTunes

2077
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Because we could definitely use some more 5 star review on iTunes

2078
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Because it helps spread the word about the program

2079
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Also, you can visit our MySpace

2080
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
www.myspace.com

2081
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Slash Orange Launch Radio

2082
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And be our friend on there

2083
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Because who doesn't love having a thousand friends on MySpace

2084
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And being attention whores over there

2085
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Also, we are now

2086
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Participating in the new All Games Community site

2087
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Over at community.allgames.com

2088
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Most of us are so far

2089
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
You will be as of tonight

2090
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
We will all have profiles on that site

2091
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And I'm actually using my blog over there

2092
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
It's kind of fun

2093
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And I've been doing official

2094
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Well, not, I don't know, official

2095
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Whatever, but Orange Launch

2096
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Video game review haikus

2097
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Where I review games in haiku form

2098
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
So if you want to see what the hell that's all about

2099
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
You gotta go find my page on

2100
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
The Community All Games site

2101
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Because I review video games in haiku form

2102
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
575

2103
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Anything else we should plug

2104
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Before we take a break

2105
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I don't know

2106
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I can't think of anything

2107
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
This is kind of a short show tonight

2108
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I have a weird story

2109
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But it's not gaming

2110
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Well, it's

2111
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
No, it's not gaming really

2112
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
There's some weird reason

2113
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Like, this is weird

2114
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Usually our shows have been running

2115
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Almost to the two hour mark

2116
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
We haven't even hit 90 minutes

2117
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
For part A this week

2118
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Why not?

2119
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
A short story from Loki

2120
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Okay, this is kind of weird

2121
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I was watching Comedy Central today

2122
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
And Spike TV absorbed Comedy Central

2123
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Like, at least on my Comcast box

2124
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So two channels were Spike TV

2125
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Which were playing some really crappy

2126
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Pros versus Joes

2127
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Or something like that

2128
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Thing, which is

2129
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I don't have any interest in sports TV

2130
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
But it was funny though

2131
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Because all of a sudden

2132
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It was like Spike TV

2133
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Also last night I was watching G4 TV

2134
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Because they had cheaters on

2135
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And that was kind of funny

2136
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
What else are you going to watch

2137
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Like, you know, at midnight

2138
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I don't know

2139
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I guess I could have watched Saturday Night Live

2140
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
But that's not funny

2141
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So

2142
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Actually, hey

2143
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
But Saturday Night Live did bring us

2144
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Laser Cats this season

2145
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
It is getting better again

2146
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It's not

2147
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
It ain't

2148
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
It ain't

2149
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
It's Dana Carvey

2150
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Chris Farley

2151
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Or, you know

2152
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Especially not

2153
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
It's Gilda Radner

2154
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Or Dan Aykroyd

2155
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Days

2156
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
But

2157
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
It is still pretty

2158
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It's getting better

2159
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Than it was last year

2160
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Of course, usually I try to go out

2161
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
On Saturday nights

2162
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So I don't know

2163
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I don't get to watch it at home a lot

2164
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
But I do see, like, the YouTubage and things

2165
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Come on, what did this year bring us?

2166
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
This year brought us Laser Cats

2167
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It brought us Dick in a Box

2168
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Some good stuff

2169
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Good stuff

2170
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I actually

2171
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I actually

2172
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
When I went to New York in October

2173
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I got to see the set

2174
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
That was kind of fun

2175
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
In a touristy way

2176
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
So, hey

2177
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Any other

2178
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Do you have any short stories

2179
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You'd like to share with our listeners

2180
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Um

2181
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I'm starting a

2182
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
A fund that's called the

2183
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Send Dark Sakura to Dragon Con Fund

2184
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Either that or buy me a Dolphie

2185
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Why don't you massage your way to Dragon Con?

2186
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
You know, I would

2187
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
But I have to take a whole lot more massage classes before then

2188
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Oh, that sucks

2189
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But, um

2190
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I'm actually

2191
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
You know what

2192
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Two weeks to go, Rob

2193
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
No, three weeks, sorry

2194
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Three weeks to go

2195
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I will be a fully certified massage therapist

2196
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And then I can charge everybody

2197
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Cool

2198
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I guess

2199
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Well, I mean

2200
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Massage is good for your health

2201
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Maybe they need

2202
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
You know

2203
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Conventions are a lot of walking

2204
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
You should massage people's feet

2205
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I'm actually thinking about

2206
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Um

2207
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Cause my friend

2208
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
A lot of my friends are on the

2209
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Fanime staff

2210
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I'm actually thinking about asking them if I can

2211
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Get an event license

2212
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
God, Fanime's right around the corner too

2213
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
May, end of May

2214
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Yeah

2215
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
But I'm seeing if

2216
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I'm gonna see if I can

2217
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Get like an event license from

2218
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Wherever I have to in San Jose

2219
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
And set up a

2220
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Set up a

2221
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Massage at

2222
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Fanime

2223
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
There you go

2224
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Fun

2225
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I don't have a chair yet

2226
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
But I can rent a chair

2227
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Alright

2228
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
So for the weary

2229
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Fanime con-goer

2230
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Do you know how often

2231
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I've been in

2232
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Fucking costume

2233
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And wish someone would rub my feet

2234
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Cause I was in

2235
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Freaking

2236
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Five inch

2237
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Platform heels

2238
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Oh my god

2239
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
My Mad Hatter costume

2240
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I've worn many an uncomfortable costume

2241
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
But my Mad Hatter costume was the worst

2242
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Because of the wings on my back

2243
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
And the fucking heels

2244
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So

2245
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I think massage therapy

2246
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
At

2247
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Anime conventions

2248
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Is brilliant

2249
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Alright well we'll see what happens

2250
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Holler if you hear me

2251
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Alright

2252
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Holla

2253
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Alright

2254
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
We better go ahead and take a break

01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So we'll be back

2256
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
