7000	12000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Waroko
14000	20000	Tonight, March 11th, 2007, as Sony won back some fans with the unveiling of PlayStation Home,
20000	26000	EA and Harmonix Forged Deal, and has an online poll foreseen the return of NiGHTS
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	41000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gamer culture and gamer lifestyle
41000	46000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
46000	47000	Hi
47000	48000	How are you doing?
48000	49000	I has salad
49000	51000	You have a salad, a yummy salad?
51000	52000	I has a salad
52000	55000	I has a fresh choice earlier today, it was good
55000	56000	I has Quiznos
56000	59000	Do they have fresh choice all throughout the country?
59000	60000	I don't know, is that a local thing?
60000	61000	No
61000	63000	Basically it's an entire restaurant that's a giant salad bar
63000	65000	The only way you get salad bars is if you go to Shoney's
65000	66000	Or Sizzler's
66000	68000	We don't have Sizzler's in Alabama
68000	70000	I know what Shoney's is, but they don't have that here
70000	71000	Shoney's is nasty
71000	74000	Well so is Waffle House, yet it's still popular
74000	75000	Waffle House is not nasty!
75000	78000	Waffle House has special drugs that they put in the hash browns
78000	82000	Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki
82000	86000	A whole place dedicated to salad is nasty
86000	87000	What the fuck?
87000	88000	They have pizza
88000	90000	It's a pita's dream, I mean seriously
90000	91000	They have pizza
91000	92000	Or pita's dream, yeah
92000	94000	They have pizza and soup too
94000	96000	Okay, well soup is okay
96000	98000	Fucking, why the fuck is pizza there?
98000	100000	That's just so random
100000	102000	I guess it's healthy pizza, I don't know
102000	107000	Well I remember, god I went there a long ass time ago with an ex
107000	113000	And I had pasta there, pasta was okay, but salad is just nasty
113000	115000	They have the best bread ever though
115000	118000	That's what food eats, I don't eat that, I eat food
118000	124000	Alright, well let's get into tonight's program
124000	127000	First off actually I want to say, Techmaster Loki, did you notice
127000	131000	We did not get the FUs of the Week music automatically start playing
131000	134000	I was a good boy this week and made that not play
134000	135000	That's because he told you to
135000	136000	What?
136000	139000	No, I thought of it all by myself
139000	143000	Stupid Jamie revealing stupid behind the scenes stuff
143000	146000	Alright anyhow, also I do want to plug the chat room
146000	148000	chat.orangelaunchradio.com
148000	150000	We have lots of boys and girls that come there to chat with us
150000	152000	Kind of the fourth guest of our program
152000	156000	When we don't have any other regular fourth guest such as tonight
156000	158000	We don't really have a regular fourth guest, that kind of sucks
158000	160000	I tried to get Dan to come
160000	161000	Oh really?
161000	163000	And his loud friends
163000	165000	Probably for the best they didn't come then
165000	167000	Yeah, they're playing some card game
167000	169000	We had a guest and then he left
169000	171000	When's Marissa coming back?
171000	172000	Maybe next week
172000	174000	Sweet, how about Chris?
174000	176000	Maybe next week
176000	178000	Because I'm horribly broke
178000	182000	I have to have Chris and Marissa come up here for doing the birthday stuff
182000	184000	I think that might be when Rice Princess and Eddie come here too
184000	187000	So we could get everybody in here in one week
187000	189000	You know what, we could just all leave
189000	191000	Honestly, three of us could just take the night off, let them do the show
191000	193000	What do you say chat room?
193000	200000	Let Chris, Rice Princess, Marissa, and Eddie do the show instead of us
200000	202000	What do you say?
202000	204000	We'll take the night off, we'll go out to eat
204000	205000	Let's do that
205000	207000	We'll go to Country Waffles
207000	209000	Our knockoff of Waffle House we have out here
209000	210000	No, we'll go to Fresh Choice
210000	212000	They closed at four
212000	216000	The entire chat room's at no, no, no
216000	218000	And they're only open breakfast and lunch
218000	220000	Oh damn it
220000	224000	Oh, we got a hell yeah from Zappy, there you go, DDR dollar bill, hell fucking yes
224000	226000	They don't love us anymore is what it boils down to
226000	228000	That's sad
228000	231000	Alright, well let's start off tonight's program the way we usually start it off
231000	233000	With a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week
233000	235000	Where we talk about the games we've been playing this week
235000	237000	If anything at all, Dark Sakura
237000	239000	Marvel Ultimate Alliance
239000	240000	Still, huh?
240000	244000	Yes, and then Dan had to take it back so he's just gonna buy it for me after Pay Day
244000	248000	The only freaking PS3 game I will play, like, regularly
248000	250000	I love my PlayStation 3 now
250000	252000	It gives me Captain America and Wolverine
252000	254000	In the same game
254000	256000	Although the damn thing is on the Wii and the 360 as well
256000	258000	I don't care
258000	260000	360 get achievement points
260000	262000	That's true, the Wii you could do
262000	264000	Flippy, floppy movie things
264000	266000	You know what, I don't like doing that
266000	268000	I do not like doing that
268000	270000	I have to say, as much as I love the Wii
270000	272000	I think that when you have games
272000	274000	That are made for play like that
274000	276000	That's one thing, but when you have a fucking platformer
276000	278000	I just fucking put a controller in my hand and let me play
278000	282000	One thing I actually don't like about the PS3 one
282000	284000	Is that it has you flip the controller to pull
284000	286000	I was gonna say the PlayStation 3 uses that six axis
286000	288000	But it's stupid
288000	290000	Six axis, like a normal word
290000	294000	Because, you know, Sony wants that big marketing oomph behind the words
294000	296000	Six axis
296000	298000	It sounds like an alien race from Doctor Who
298000	299000	Kinda
299000	301000	Exterminate
301000	303000	God damn it, Tigerclaw
303000	305000	Why do you have to drive the knife in my heart?
305000	308000	I'm assuming, I haven't even looked at chat
308000	310000	I'm assuming Tigerclaw is talking about
310000	312000	How your Wednesday must have been
312000	313000	How did your Wednesday go?
313000	315000	I hate you Marvel
315000	317000	You bitches
317000	320000	In case for whatever reason this is your first week listening to Orange Launch Radio
320000	322000	You know, Sony is talking about our personal lives as well
322000	324000	And one thing that Dark Soccer is also a fangirl of
324000	326000	Is comics, namely
326000	328000	Captain America
328000	330000	Which is funny because really on this program
330000	332000	I know you've liked Captain America a long time
332000	334000	But it really seems like, especially in the past six weeks
334000	336000	Your fandom seems to have rekindled
336000	339000	Because I started reading all the Civil War comics
339000	341000	And I was like, dude, he's cool
341000	343000	But then, so it was kinda funny
343000	345000	I mean, not like funny haha
345000	347000	But funny like, don't call Jamie today
347000	349000	Like when I saw it in the news
349000	351000	That they'd killed off Captain America
351000	354000	So how was your day when that happened?
354000	355000	He will be back
355000	356000	You think he'll be back?
356000	358000	Oh come on, it's a fucking
358000	360000	You know, Marvel needs money
360000	362000	So they do a gimmicky thing
362000	364000	So I was looking at your
364000	366000	All games community page today
366000	368000	And somebody decided to jab the knife through your heart
368000	370000	A little more there and say, going
370000	372000	Basically somebody put a comment on Jamie's page and said like
372000	373000	Haha, Captain America died
373000	374000	What do you say to those people that say
374000	376000	Haha, Captain America died?
376000	378000	Die in a fire
378000	380000	That's what I thought
380000	382000	Is there anything else in your week you want to talk about?
382000	384000	Um
384000	386000	I really like my salad
386000	388000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
388000	389000	Salad the game
389000	391000	It's alright, we don't have to worry about Captain America dying
391000	393000	Because Afghanistan is going to come and replace him
393000	395000	So
395000	397000	Wow, that's a very unpolitically correct comment
397000	399000	And he's going to be far more awesome
399000	402000	My gaming week was filled with lots of stuff actually
402000	405000	I played quite a few different games
405000	407000	Starting on the 360
407000	409000	Of course played Crackdown
409000	411000	Because Crackdown is awesome
411000	413000	I did play
413000	415000	What else did I play?
415000	417000	Oh, Armored Core 4
417000	419000	Which is pretty cool
419000	421000	It's going a lot faster than
421000	423000	ChromeHounds
423000	425000	Looking forward to that, I'm not sure if I want to pick it up yet
425000	427000	Because I'm trying to cut back on the amount of games I buy
427000	429000	But it's still pretty cool
429000	431000	On the Playstation 3
431000	433000	I downloaded Flow
433000	435000	Tried that
435000	437000	It was pretty good, kind of relaxing I guess
437000	439000	I didn't realize that there were actually
439000	441000	Stages in the game
441000	443000	So it's kind of neat they get to become different things
443000	445000	Including like a dolphin looking thing
445000	447000	So that's kind of neat
447000	449000	And then I played Motorstorm
449000	451000	Which Motorstorm is pretty awesome
451000	453000	Graphically and it's pretty fun to play
453000	455000	My only gripe on it
455000	457000	Split screen multiplayer for one
457000	459000	That would have been nice
459000	461000	The other thing is
461000	463000	The game looks so awesome
463000	465000	And there's like some pretty cool
465000	467000	Animation in the menus and stuff
467000	469000	But during races
469000	471000	The fucking spectators are cardboard cutouts
471000	475000	And they're not even animated cardboard cutouts
475000	477000	They're just like stuck in a pose
477000	479000	And I'm like
479000	481000	I understand that you know you probably couldn't animate
481000	483000	All these people in the game
483000	485000	Even though other games can do that
485000	487000	You know
487000	491000	That's how I was in the Gran Turismo HD concept at E3 right?
491000	493000	Oh yeah and I still thought I was retarded there
493000	495000	Huh
495000	497000	Granted they're probably trying to save on
497000	499000	You know calculations and stuff
499000	501000	To make it run smoother but
501000	503000	The least you could do is make them animate
503000	505000	A little bit so I can kind of go
505000	507000	Okay at least that doesn't look
507000	509000	As hokey you know
509000	511000	It's 2D but at least it's animating
511000	513000	Or doing something you know cheering and stuff
513000	515000	Why is it just a person standing there frozen
515000	517000	It just looks retarded that's something you would do
517000	519000	On like the fucking Super Nintendo
519000	521000	Or something and even the fucking
521000	523000	Super Nintendo had animated sprites
523000	525000	That were cheering in the background
525000	527000	Yeah but those little dudes aren't sprites anymore
527000	529000	Sprites are so last gen
529000	531000	Okay well it's still
531000	533000	Something that's sitting there at 3D spaces
533000	535000	2D okay whatever
535000	537000	So they could have done that
537000	539000	That's my big gripe on that
539000	541000	Otherwise the game's fun
541000	543000	You know I had a lot of fun playing it
543000	545000	Speaking of last gen Alpha Canogram in chat says
545000	547000	Loki split screen multiplayer is so
547000	549000	Last gen
549000	551000	Oh yeah it's so last gen that's why
551000	553000	Halo 3 is gonna fucking have split screen multiplayer
553000	555000	That's why Call of Duty 3
555000	557000	Has split screen multiplayer
557000	559000	That's why Gears of War has split screen multiplayer
559000	561000	So fuck off it's still
561000	563000	In town okay
563000	565000	No last gen it's because you can't
565000	567000	Fucking program a game that can have multiple
567000	569000	Instances of it running at the same time
569000	571000	So that's just lazy
571000	573000	Programming which you know
573000	575000	Oh I'm sure Motorstorm wasn't lazy
575000	577000	Programming it wasn't like they downgraded from
577000	579000	1080p and 60 frames per second
579000	581000	To 720p and 30 frames per second
581000	583000	Which I still say though
583000	585000	The game looks fun
585000	587000	And it looks pretty awesome
587000	589000	Some other things that they probably didn't think about though
589000	591000	When you're playing in first person like say
591000	593000	In the cockpit type of thing
593000	595000	And it's not really in the cockpit
595000	597000	The camera's just on the front of the vehicle
597000	599000	Which is still stupid
599000	601000	But if you happen to crash into something
601000	603000	And your hood gets bent
603000	605000	You could actually not be able to drive in that perspective
605000	607000	Because it's blocking the whole camera
607000	609000	Which totally makes sense
609000	611000	But anyways
611000	613000	So other than Playstation 3 stuff
613000	615000	Let's see here
615000	617000	On the PSP I was playing of course
617000	619000	Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories
619000	621000	Which is fun
621000	623000	I also put some homebrew stuff on there
623000	625000	Including this game called No Gravity
625000	627000	Which I might say that this game right here
627000	629000	They could totally sell at retail
629000	631000	And it looks a lot better than most of the PSP games
631000	633000	Out there
633000	635000	And so the fact that most of those games out there
635000	637000	For the PSP are getting their asses kicked
637000	639000	By a homebrew game
639000	641000	That's pretty sad
641000	643000	A demo for a game looks way better
643000	645000	Than a lot of stuff like Konami
645000	647000	Capcom, whatever
647000	649000	Put out on the PSP
649000	651000	It can be done
651000	653000	I just would like to see some more independent games come out there
653000	655000	Maybe something like XNA
655000	657000	Or something like that for the PSP
657000	659000	Would be pretty awesome
659000	661000	But that's about it
661000	663000	I'm about to load the Thrill Kill
663000	665000	And DDR Fifth Mix on my PSP
665000	667000	During the show
667000	669000	Keep us posted on that
669000	671000	So you're not actually going to be participating in tonight's show?
671000	673000	Oh ok
673000	675000	Do that in between
675000	677000	Hitstun wants to know
677000	679000	Does the retail MotorStorm crash every five minutes?
679000	681000	Nope
681000	683000	Wasn't it determined that the crashing of MotorStorm
683000	685000	Was the resetting of the system gone wrong
685000	687000	When people were supposed to...
687000	689000	It was because it was overheating
689000	691000	I don't know
691000	693000	Download the demo, it doesn't crash on the PS3
693000	695000	Fine, whatever
695000	697000	My Gaming Week, surprisingly enough
697000	699000	I actually played a little bit of Crackdown this week
699000	701000	Which is usually not the type of game I would get into
701000	703000	But Crackdown is kind of fun
703000	705000	It's like Grand Theft Auto
705000	707000	Only there's no hookers to have sex with
707000	709000	And you jump really really high
709000	711000	And flying all over the place
711000	713000	But I find there's a lot to discover
713000	715000	I kind of like just walking around doing random stuff
715000	717000	I don't really like having to fight the gangs
717000	719000	And get into that whole thing
719000	721000	No, I like to jump around the Ferris wheel
721000	723000	And do the little race around the Ferris wheel
723000	725000	That stuff's fun
725000	727000	And finding the orbs and all that stupid crap
727000	729000	Good times with Crackdown
729000	731000	A couple people tried to challenge me
731000	733000	In co-op or whatever
733000	735000	Or I guess you don't really challenge someone in co-op
735000	737000	They wanted to play co-op with me and I declined
737000	739000	Because I suck at Crackdown
739000	741000	But this week I'll probably actually play
741000	743000	Because I was still trying to learn Crackdown
743000	745000	I don't want someone to come into the game with me
745000	747000	And I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing
747000	749000	Did I just shoot you? Oh shit, I just blew you up with a rocket
749000	751000	I don't know
751000	753000	I kind of want to have a little skill
753000	755000	Because sometimes I feel weird playing listeners
755000	757000	On the Xbox friends list
757000	759000	But I think the listeners sometimes expect us to actually be good at games
759000	761000	Because we talk about them
761000	763000	We really don't know about you
763000	765000	Oh, hi Rice Princess, you came out of nowhere
765000	767000	Oh, sorry
767000	769000	They really don't know much about you then
769000	771000	No, they don't
771000	773000	I was a jab at you
773000	775000	JeremyTau1 said, Rob didn't want to play co-op with me
775000	777000	He denied me when I asked to join his game
777000	779000	Actually that may not have been me
779000	781000	Because the other thing you have to keep in mind
781000	783000	Is that Shane has been playing my game without asking
783000	785000	I wish he could set a password
785000	787000	On the Xbox Live accounts
787000	789000	Maybe he can, I just haven't done it
789000	791000	I don't care, but Shane has been signing on to my account
791000	793000	And playing Crackdown
793000	795000	I only let him do it because he's been getting me achievements
795000	797000	So it's all good
797000	799000	Because I'm still trying to get those 1500 points
799000	801000	So I can win, what was it?
801000	803000	Like a gamer picture and a copy of a game I already own
803000	805000	Contra, something like that
805000	807000	Because I want my e-penis to grow by 1500 points
807000	809000	With the whole Xbox Live contest thing
809000	811000	So that would be fun
811000	813000	What?
813000	815000	So you're having an e-penis fluffer take over
815000	817000	Yes, Shane is fluffing my e-penis
817000	819000	Maybe right now as we speak
819000	821000	Don't make a face, Rice Princess
821000	823000	Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
823000	825000	If you have anything to share
825000	827000	Hey, guess what? I was playing WoW
827000	829000	Wow, you played WoW
829000	831000	Wow, that's the same as every other week
831000	833000	I play a lot of World of Warcraft as well, actually
833000	835000	I know
835000	837000	Almost every time I come on, I see you
837000	839000	I made a troll
839000	841000	You're a troll
841000	843000	That wasn't nice
843000	845000	Well she is, she said she made a troll
845000	847000	I made a troll
847000	849000	Jamie's a troll
849000	851000	You're a dirty napkin
851000	853000	Totally should
853000	855000	So did you do anything fun in WoW?
855000	857000	Aren't you one of those twink players?
857000	859000	You don't level past level 19
859000	861000	With all your gear?
861000	863000	It's 29, get it right
863000	865000	Oh, it's 29 now
865000	867000	Because you told me when I played on your server once
867000	869000	That you play nothing but Warsong Gulch for the rest of your life
869000	871000	Yeah, that's what I did originally
871000	873000	But then I discovered the world of 29
873000	875000	And I was like, wow, you get poisons as a rogue
875000	877000	And you get Arathi Basin
877000	879000	Which I think is an awesome PVP
879000	881000	Exactly
881000	883000	Because Warsong Gulch is so
883000	885000	Last gen
885000	887000	Oh my god, yeah, like who does that anymore?
887000	889000	God
889000	891000	It's all about Isla Storm
891000	893000	The other thing I want to know, where exactly did the term
893000	895000	Twink come from? Because when I hear
895000	897000	Twink, I think about something very different
897000	899000	I don't think about
899000	901000	World of Warcraft, I think about
901000	903000	The gay porn that you see advertised
903000	905000	The twink porn
905000	907000	I don't know, it's a little weird
907000	909000	That's where the mind goes
909000	911000	How did a World of Warcraft
911000	913000	Term come up to match up with a
913000	915000	Gay term?
915000	917000	I don't know for certain, but I have my
917000	919000	Theory
919000	921000	Twinks are like
921000	923000	The young, hot
923000	925000	Boys, right? Like the good looking
925000	927000	Ones that
927000	929000	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
929000	931000	But sure, I guess I get what you're getting at
931000	933000	Like magazine looking guys
933000	935000	Well why don't you elaborate on what exactly a
935000	937000	Gay twink is?
937000	939000	I don't know if all the listeners want to know
939000	941000	It's basically a person who
941000	943000	I would think, a guy who kind of looks
943000	945000	Underage, who isn't
945000	947000	Like your blonde hair, blue eyed
947000	949000	That whole thing
949000	951000	Completely waxed everywhere
951000	953000	Type look
953000	955000	So like the best looking
955000	957000	No?
957000	959000	It has to do with like an
959000	961000	Age thing?
961000	963000	Do we really have to keep going with this topic?
963000	965000	Maybe my perception of what a twink is
965000	967000	Is different
967000	969000	I thought it was like
969000	971000	It had something to do with old men
971000	973000	Liking twinks
973000	975000	So they would be their sugar daddies
975000	977000	And give them a lot of money
977000	979000	And I'm thinking, okay, well to be a twink
979000	981000	You need to pay for your stuff
981000	983000	So maybe twinking is like
983000	985000	Horing yourself out to get money
985000	987000	To get all these awesome enchants
987000	989000	But that's just a theory
989000	991000	I don't really know
991000	993000	I just heard a bunch of people say, oh, twink, twink, twink
993000	995000	And I was like, okay, sure
995000	997000	That's exactly what I am
997000	999000	If by twink you mean awesome
999000	1001000	Alright
1001000	1003000	I'm trying to see if there's anything in the chat room here
1003000	1005000	That says what's going on
1005000	1007000	JV Mon says, welcome to Gay Slang Chat on OLR
1007000	1009000	Let's see
1009000	1011000	Squeenix says
1011000	1013000	In the gay slang
1013000	1015000	Twink is a term that describes a young
1015000	1017000	Or young looking male, usually of slender build
1017000	1019000	With little to no body hair
1019000	1021000	Often they are described as blonde hair and blue eyed
1021000	1023000	To many gay men
1023000	1025000	The term is pejorative
1025000	1027000	And implies shallowness and stupidity
1027000	1029000	Twinks are typically contrasted with bears
1029000	1031000	And that's from Wikipedia
1031000	1033000	So there you have it
1033000	1035000	But that doesn't say anything about, how the hell then
1035000	1037000	You know what, I have no idea
1037000	1039000	I didn't realize there were so many gay players
1039000	1041000	And wow, right
1041000	1043000	That they would come up with the term
1043000	1045000	I'm done with this topic
1045000	1047000	I'm done with that, let's talk about other news
1047000	1049000	But I only stopped by to say hi
1049000	1051000	Someone leave now
1051000	1053000	Bye, get out, we don't like you anyway
1053000	1055000	Get out
1055000	1057000	Yes
1057000	1059000	Most of the podcasts you're listening to this week
1059000	1061000	Are probably going to be talking a lot about
1061000	1063000	Their experiences at Game Developers Conference
1063000	1065000	But not us, we didn't go
1065000	1067000	Nope
1067000	1069000	That's right, we sat home on our big butts
1069000	1071000	And read about it on the internet
1071000	1073000	Just like most of you guys out there did at home
1073000	1075000	I was originally going to go to Game Developers Conference
1075000	1077000	But some things came up
1077000	1079000	And I didn't end up going
1079000	1081000	But we did get to
1081000	1083000	Go to San Francisco yesterday to meet
1083000	1085000	Some people that we, you know
1085000	1087000	If I had gone to Game Developers Conference
1087000	1089000	It would have been like a networking thing
1089000	1091000	Like I would have gotten to meet a lot of people
1091000	1093000	So what we did is we drove to San Francisco
1093000	1095000	Because some of our buddies over at All Games
1095000	1097000	Were in town and of course we rebroadcast our program
1097000	1099000	Over on All Games on Monday nights
1099000	1101000	So we went over and met with some of the
1101000	1103000	All Games folks, we met with Bobby
1103000	1105000	And we met with Lawrence, although Lawrence we were
1105000	1107000	Basically taking to the airport so we didn't get to spend a lot of time with him
1107000	1109000	But Bobby who does the
1109000	1111000	Other Sunday night show you might listen to over
1111000	1113000	On All Games, we spent some time with him
1113000	1115000	When we went to Sunnyvale Golf Land
1115000	1117000	Which, you know, is a pretty big
1117000	1119000	Arcade, kind of infamous
1119000	1121000	In Northern California for the many fighting game
1121000	1123000	Tournaments it's had and
1123000	1125000	DDR music game tournaments it's had
1125000	1127000	Kind of sad to go
1127000	1129000	In there and see the place as
1129000	1131000	Basically turned into like the entire middle
1131000	1133000	Where they used to have tons of classic
1133000	1135000	Games, like you know
1135000	1137000	They had like the old school fighting games
1137000	1139000	And stuff were all up in the middle section
1139000	1141000	All gone and it's all ticket spitters now
1141000	1143000	Which kind of made me sad
1143000	1145000	I don't know, I made this big long rant over
1145000	1147000	At my All Games blog
1147000	1149000	Over at community.allgames.com
1149000	1151000	About
1151000	1153000	How kind of sad it is just to see that
1153000	1155000	The arcades are kind of
1155000	1157000	Really giving way to the ticket spitters
1157000	1159000	And although Sunnyvale Golf Land did have
1159000	1161000	Some pretty cool music
1161000	1163000	Games, they had, you know, Be Me and You
1163000	1165000	2DX Happy Sky which I got to play and they had
1165000	1167000	Pop'n Music 8 which was cool and they had some
1167000	1169000	Nice racing games, they had
1169000	1171000	Like everything in the little niche genres they had
1171000	1173000	I don't know, it was kind of sad to see
1173000	1175000	That most of the arcade is turned into that whole
1175000	1177000	Gambling for kids thing
1177000	1179000	So it kind of got me thinking
1179000	1181000	What do you think it would take
1181000	1183000	For us to really go back to arcades now
1183000	1185000	Because you know a lot of folks say that arcades
1185000	1187000	Are dying because
1187000	1189000	You can get the same experience at home
1189000	1191000	And you can get a lot of them on Xbox Live
1191000	1193000	What do arcades need
1193000	1195000	To do business again?
1195000	1197000	New games and well maintained games
1197000	1199000	And just something
1199000	1201000	Because even still you can play DDR at home
1201000	1203000	But it's not the same as playing in the arcade
1203000	1206000	And you need the atmosphere back
1206000	1208000	That's pretty much it
1208000	1210000	If I were to be opening an arcade
1210000	1212000	It wouldn't have any ticket spitters
1212000	1214000	At all
1214000	1216000	I don't care if that's why kids come in there
1216000	1218000	But you need to bring people in
1218000	1220000	That are looking for the arcade experience
1220000	1222000	Not just have arcade games
1222000	1224000	So that little Billy can run in there
1224000	1226000	And say mommy mommy I want to spend money
1226000	1228000	And play games and stuff
1228000	1230000	And win crap with tickets
1230000	1232000	They just kind of have that stuff
1232000	1234000	Out of golf land
1234000	1236000	Keep people there longer after their game of golf
1236000	1238000	Or before their game of golf
1238000	1240000	Dave and Busters
1240000	1244000	Dave and Busters is kind of like that for adults
1244000	1246000	I mean do you really play a lot of the arcade games
1246000	1248000	Dave and Busters? Maybe a few
1248000	1250000	But a lot of us kind of succumb to the whole ticket spitting
1250000	1252000	Thing at Dave and Busters because we're drunk
1252000	1254000	Right?
1254000	1256000	No I usually go often
1256000	1258000	You know when they had the
1258000	1260000	What was the meca salt
1260000	1262000	I know that that was always what
1262000	1264000	Whenever I'd go with Dan and the guys
1264000	1266000	That would be what they went right for
1266000	1268000	And I always played my deluxe games
1268000	1270000	But they got rid of meca salt
1270000	1272000	Stupid fuckers
1272000	1274000	I'm not really angry at the ticket spitters
1274000	1276000	Necessarily it's disappointing to see
1276000	1278000	But if that's where the money is
1278000	1280000	It's not like I'm totally mad at golf land
1280000	1282000	Because if that's where the money is
1282000	1284000	That's what they're going to buy
1284000	1286000	Granted those ticket spitters probably make them a ton of money
1286000	1288000	But I try to think about
1288000	1290000	What's really been new in the arcade lately
1290000	1292000	That I've had to get excited about
1292000	1294000	DDR Supernova?
1294000	1296000	Well I'm sorry Bomani fans
1296000	1298000	But DDR Supernova
1298000	1300000	Was pretty much just a DDR 9th mix
1300000	1302000	It didn't bring a whole lot of new stuff to the table
1302000	1304000	Really
1304000	1306000	It was just kind of the same game all over again
1306000	1308000	And even you could say the games like
1308000	1310000	In the Groove and stuff that tried to fill in the gaps
1310000	1312000	Same thing it was 4 panel dancing
1312000	1314000	It was the same damn game you always knew
1314000	1316000	But even DDR alone was not going to save an arcade
1316000	1318000	You know what I mean?
1318000	1320000	There hasn't been a lot of new stuff in general
1320000	1322000	I mean the last big new arcade release
1322000	1324000	I can think of was Soul Calibur 3
1324000	1326000	But that was already on the home consoles
1326000	1328000	So I don't know
1328000	1330000	It seems like they're really starting to go away from making arcade games
1330000	1332000	It's kind of sad
1332000	1334000	Because if it weren't for that arcade community
1334000	1336000	This show would not exist
1336000	1338000	Period
1338000	1340000	We need more Planet Harrier
1340000	1342000	I don't know if that's going to save it
1342000	1344000	We'll see
1344000	1346000	I'm trying to go to the chat room
1346000	1348000	Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com
1348000	1350000	See I had all games on the brain
1350000	1352000	Because of our little discussion with Bobby
1352000	1354000	Don't go to that chat room, that's the wrong one
1354000	1356000	Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com
1356000	1358000	Let's see
1358000	1360000	I'm trying to see what kind of chat is going on here
1360000	1362000	Fireboma says the arcade by me
1362000	1364000	Is just having games that are more like rides now
1364000	1366000	Some of those can be okay though
1366000	1368000	Remember After Burner?
1368000	1370000	With the freaking thing that you would sit in
1370000	1372000	That would practically make you sick?
1372000	1374000	Let's see
1374000	1376000	NM64 says
1376000	1378000	Arcade Halo
1378000	1380000	Sadly that would probably bring them back
1380000	1382000	You know, I kind of tend to agree
1382000	1384000	Something like that
1384000	1386000	Do they have that?
1386000	1388000	Do you remember The Grid?
1388000	1390000	They have Half Life in Japan where you can play that in the arcade
1390000	1392000	Really? I think about a game we saw at E3
1392000	1394000	A couple years ago
1394000	1396000	I remember it was 04, 05
1396000	1398000	And Amiro of all companies was showing off
1398000	1400000	This arcade game that would actually interface with computer versions of the game
1400000	1402000	It was like a first person shooter
1402000	1404000	Yeah, that's pretty cool
1404000	1406000	OL Army Recruit
1406000	1408000	I'm sorry, James Patrick says
1408000	1410000	Virtua Fighter 5 should come to US arcades
1410000	1412000	I don't know
1412000	1414000	That would be interesting
1414000	1416000	Alright, so I don't know if there's an easy answer
1416000	1418000	To how arcades can be kind of fun again
1418000	1420000	For all of us
1420000	1422000	Not just, you know, kids
1422000	1424000	8 through 12 or whatever
1424000	1426000	We welcome your feedback
1426000	1428000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com
1428000	1430000	And bloggyblog
1430000	1432000	Over at the community.allgames site
1432000	1434000	And leave a comment, that would be awesome
1434000	1436000	And I just want to say thanks to Bobby
1436000	1438000	For hanging out with us yesterday
1438000	1440000	And you should check out his show
1440000	1442000	He's on allgames.com at 5 o'clock pacific time
1442000	1444000	About an hour before we go live over here
1444000	1446000	At OrangeLawnsRadio.com
1446000	1448000	He also does a podcast
1448000	1450000	It's a different show over there
1450000	1452000	Because it's just him and his chat room and his callers
1452000	1454000	So the chat and the callers
1454000	1456000	Really drive that show
1456000	1458000	He's a pretty good moderator
1458000	1460000	And he actually moderated a panel at GDC
1460000	1462000	That Loki and I listened to on the car ride home
1462000	1464000	It was pretty good. Good times
1464000	1466000	And I forgot to mention
1466000	1468000	I played a lot of games over at
1468000	1470000	You know, Sunnyvale Golf Land
1470000	1472000	Loki playing popin' music was fuckin' hilarious
1472000	1474000	I hate popin' music
1474000	1476000	But I had like $10 in tokens
1476000	1478000	And I needed to get rid of them
1478000	1480000	And I was too tired to play DDR
1480000	1482000	Yet I did play more of it
1482000	1484000	So I played popin' 8
1484000	1486000	At popin' music
1486000	1488000	I'm not surprised because I knew I sucked
1488000	1490000	At popin' music
1490000	1492000	It's just I really sucked at popin' music
1492000	1494000	I played the Star Trek theme and that sucked
1494000	1496000	And then I played some random song
1496000	1498000	And that really sucked
1498000	1500000	And then I played 2DX, Happy Sky
1500000	1502000	And I sucked at that and that was fun
1502000	1504000	And I played Supernova and Supernova was pretty good
1504000	1506000	Until I picked a random double song
1506000	1508000	That was like a cata or something
1508000	1510000	And I was too tired to play it
1510000	1512000	I played part of it though
1512000	1514000	I'm just getting too out of shape for this
1514000	1516000	I'm out of practice
1516000	1518000	BlackWolf
1518000	1520000	Is actually in chat right now and says
1520000	1522000	Sky might have taken video on his phone, actually didn't
1522000	1524000	I did take a picture though, I'll put that on the community site later
1524000	1526000	Of Loki playing popin' music
1526000	1528000	Good times
1528000	1530000	Good times
1530000	1532000	James Patrick's continuing on the Virtua Fighter 5 thing
1532000	1534000	That would be great
1534000	1536000	Knowing you could fight anyone in Japan or America
1536000	1538000	Who's using the Virtua Fighter 5 arcade
1538000	1540000	Kinda going with that whole thing about
1540000	1542000	Being able to interface with computers and stuff
1542000	1544000	Pretty cool
1544000	1548000	Illusion says that Pachinko machines could revitalize arcades
1548000	1550000	That's an interesting thought
1550000	1552000	Alright
1552000	1554000	So anyway we had fun at the arcade the other day
1554000	1556000	But going back to Game Developers Conference
1556000	1558000	And starting off tonight's news
1558000	1560000	I want to talk about of course
1560000	1562000	Huge news in the Sony department
1562000	1564000	In fact this news is like so big
1564000	1566000	We might actually want to take calls on this
1566000	1568000	Just this a little later
1568000	1570000	Sony unveiled this week
1570000	1572000	At the Game Developers Conference
1572000	1574000	It's very interesting
1574000	1576000	And we'll talk about Nintendo's conference in part B
1576000	1578000	But a lot of the stuff that you saw
1578000	1580000	Like the big companies do
1580000	1582000	Was really about the game development
1582000	1584000	They didn't turn Game Developers Conference into E3
1584000	1586000	Like a lot of people thought
1586000	1588000	Which is a good thing I think
1588000	1590000	Game developers need their hangout
1590000	1592000	It was not E3
1592000	1594000	But Sony kind of used their keynote
1594000	1596000	To drop E3 like bombs at
1596000	1598000	Where they need to right
1598000	1600000	They're getting the bad press right now
1600000	1602000	Everybody kind of gives them a buy
1602000	1604000	To use Game Developers Conference as their platform
1604000	1606000	And some would say they hit a home run
1606000	1608000	I think so
1608000	1610000	Key word there is home
1610000	1612000	They revealed PlayStation Home
1612000	1614000	Of course we talked about it last week
1614000	1616000	But even when we talked about it last week
1616000	1618000	And the whole Kotaku drama that resulted
1618000	1620000	I don't think I was expecting anything like this
1620000	1622000	I don't think any of us were
1622000	1624000	When I heard it was going to be like Animal Crossing
1624000	1626000	I'm picturing to myself
1626000	1628000	Oh cutesy, cartoony
1628000	1630000	Animal Crossing with your me's
1630000	1632000	No no no no
1632000	1634000	What they unveiled instead
1634000	1636000	Is a service that looks like Second Life
1636000	1638000	It's like a virtual world
1638000	1640000	And here's a screenshot we have here in studio
1640000	1642000	You can see all these people with their customizable outfits
1642000	1644000	Kind of walking around this virtual world
1644000	1646000	But not only that
1646000	1648000	When you're in this virtual world
1648000	1650000	You can invite people over to your virtual apartment
1650000	1652000	And you can look at your virtual trophy rack
1652000	1654000	They've basically taken Microsoft's achievement system
1654000	1656000	And kind of evolved it into
1656000	1658000	Hey you can get trophies that you put in your house
1658000	1660000	Look at my stuff
1660000	1662000	Come over and look at my stuff
1662000	1664000	But not just that
1664000	1666000	Let's say you want to put a TV in your apartment
1666000	1668000	Then you can run videos on your TV from your PlayStation
1668000	1670000	Put pictures up on the wall
1670000	1672000	That you have on your PlayStation drive
1672000	1674000	Walk up to a pool table that you put down your place
1674000	1676000	And actually start playing pool
1676000	1678000	They're going to have some games included with this
1678000	1680000	All of it, free
1680000	1682000	It's going to be part of
1682000	1684000	That's basically what they're saying
1684000	1686000	What Microsoft is giving you in Xbox Live
1686000	1688000	We are now going to give you this service
1688000	1690000	Called PlayStation Home
1690000	1692000	And it's free
1692000	1694000	Of course the money that they're going to make
1694000	1696000	Advertising on all the billboards throughout the place
1696000	1698000	And people love to customize
1698000	1700000	So unless you want the raggy
1700000	1702000	Cheap Ikea furniture in your apartment
1702000	1704000	If you want some of the nice
1704000	1706000	Bling couches and stuff
1706000	1708000	You're going to have to probably pay for those
1708000	1710000	People will probably do it
1710000	1712000	People will do that because they buy shit in Second Life
1712000	1714000	So this will all roll out
1714000	1716000	In a closed beta
1716000	1718000	Of about 15,000 users
1718000	1720000	Between April and August
1720000	1722000	The open beta, about 50,000 users
1722000	1724000	August through October
1724000	1726000	And the service will go live with everybody
1726000	1728000	Probably about October
1728000	1730000	The best part about those
1730000	1732000	They're saying different games
1732000	1734000	Kind of like how they have with the gamer pics
1734000	1736000	And the games that you play on Xbox 360
1736000	1738000	Right now, you're going to be getting
1738000	1740000	Custom outfits and crap for your house
1740000	1742000	Basically by playing games
1742000	1744000	Or unlocking achievements
1744000	1746000	You'll get different things that way as well
1746000	1748000	So that's kind of neat
1748000	1750000	Alright, and that wasn't the only thing
1750000	1752000	Sony unveiled at the conference, correct?
1752000	1754000	Yes, there's another game that they were
1754000	1756000	Touting, it's basically a game called
1756000	1758000	Little Big Planet
1758000	1760000	And it's basically a community made game
1760000	1762000	You create your own levels
1762000	1764000	The entire thing is physics based
1764000	1766000	It's kind of similar to like Gary's mod
1766000	1768000	In Half Life 2
1768000	1770000	And you create these little
1770000	1772000	Almost like platformer levels
1772000	1774000	That you and your friends will play
1774000	1776000	And try to find their way through
1776000	1778000	And so it's totally customizable
1778000	1780000	You'll be able to download them
1780000	1782000	Rate them, and so on and so forth
1782000	1784000	But it's just, it looks like
1784000	1786000	A lot of fun
1786000	1788000	And it's actually selling a lot of people
1788000	1790000	On the whole
1790000	1792000	Playstation 3 experience
1792000	1794000	What they were definitely pushing
1794000	1796000	With their keynote was
1796000	1798000	This game 3.0 where
1798000	1800000	Most of the content out there would be
1800000	1802000	User created, which is kind of ironic
1802000	1804000	When you think about it because
1804000	1806000	They have all these firmware updates and stuff
1806000	1808000	For the PSP to stop user created
1808000	1810000	Content for that
1810000	1812000	I think that's kind of funny
1812000	1814000	But yeah, definitely
1814000	1816000	Cool little game
1816000	1818000	Hopefully it will come out soon
1818000	1820000	Definitely
1820000	1822000	One of the types of things that Sony
1822000	1824000	Is going to need
1824000	1826000	It's kind of like
1826000	1828000	I think we've all been waiting for something like this
1828000	1830000	Out of Sony
1830000	1832000	I don't know about you guys, but this is definitely
1832000	1834000	This put the brakes on the negative Sony press bandwagon
1834000	1836000	And now I think Sony's turned around
1836000	1838000	In another direction
1838000	1840000	But I would say the question is how much
1840000	1842000	I've heard people say everything from
1842000	1844000	Eh, whatever
1844000	1846000	To I'm going to go out and buy a Playstation 3
1846000	1848000	Now this is exactly what I need
1848000	1850000	If you guys are Playstation 3 owners
1850000	1852000	What do you think about this news?
1852000	1854000	Well it's awesome because their current service
1854000	1856000	Sucks
1856000	1858000	By the way, everyone wants to know
1858000	1860000	Is BlackWolf still your only friend?
1860000	1862000	No he's not
1862000	1864000	I do have about 7 now
1864000	1866000	So thank you for those people that sent requests
1866000	1868000	That's awesome
1868000	1870000	It's just basically
1870000	1872000	With the whole friend request system
1872000	1874000	You don't really know who's on there unless you talk to people
1874000	1876000	Thank you, I have more than one friend now
1876000	1878000	That's awesome
1878000	1880000	So the surface
1880000	1882000	Since I already own a Playstation 3
1882000	1884000	I personally probably wouldn't buy
1884000	1886000	A Playstation 3
1886000	1888000	For just this stuff
1888000	1890000	But it's definitely helping it
1890000	1892000	It makes their service look a bit nicer
1892000	1894000	It fleshes it out
1894000	1896000	Because before their network service was like
1896000	1898000	Well fuck, we don't know what they're doing
1898000	1900000	And to be honest, as of right now they haven't done anything
1900000	1902000	So this home service
1902000	1904000	Is going to be pretty awesome
1904000	1906000	It's going to be a great way to actually meet people
1906000	1908000	And to be able to add more friends that way
1908000	1910000	And just a really cool community thing
1910000	1912000	And I think it's going to have the same appeal
1912000	1914000	As Second Life or Sims
1914000	1916000	People are going to be customizing their own
1916000	1918000	You're going to see
1918000	1920000	Home places that are going to be themed around
1920000	1922000	Your websites
1922000	1924000	And you know
1924000	1926000	It's going to be crazy
1926000	1928000	You're going to have people reporting from home
1928000	1930000	Jamie, any thoughts on this?
1930000	1932000	I have MySpace
1932000	1934000	And LiveJournal for getting in touch with people
1934000	1936000	I think all I would do
1936000	1938000	Is just sit around and mess with stuff in it
1938000	1940000	Like I do with The Sims
1940000	1942000	I hate Second Life by the way
1942000	1944000	But
1944000	1946000	It wouldn't be any
1946000	1948000	It wouldn't make or break it for me
1948000	1950000	But since I already have it, I would use it
1950000	1952000	That type of thing
1952000	1954000	For me, I don't own a Playstation 3
1954000	1956000	And I've actually had several people ask me
1956000	1958000	Is this going to make you go buy a Playstation 3?
1958000	1960000	No
1960000	1962000	But it helps
1962000	1964000	But again, what is the golden rule of gaming boys and girls?
1964000	1966000	A system is only as good
1966000	1968000	As the games that are on it
1968000	1970000	Trust me, this is a huge step in the right direction
1970000	1972000	Because I love that
1972000	1974000	You know, they've kind of done something
1974000	1976000	You know, come to think of it
1976000	1978000	I think we had a caller last week or the week before
1978000	1980000	And I'm so sorry to the caller
1980000	1982000	Because I can't remember who called in and said this
1982000	1984000	But somebody called in and said
1984000	1986000	Sony is really good at ripping everybody else off
1986000	1988000	And doing it a little better
1988000	1990000	That was actually on a podcast
1990000	1992000	Somebody else said that
1992000	1994000	But when I heard that on the podcast
1994000	1996000	I remember somebody calling in
1996000	1998000	And saying it as well
1998000	2000000	And I thought to myself
2000000	2002000	You know, when we took the call on air
2002000	2004000	I was kind of like, oh yeah, okay
2004000	2006000	That's a cute thing
2006000	2008000	But I was kind of thinking when I saw this
2008000	2010000	God damn, they're right
2010000	2012000	That person, whoever called us, stand up and take a bow
2012000	2014000	Whoever did that
2014000	2016000	Because that was absolutely right
2016000	2018000	We all thought
2018000	2020000	Microsoft's achievement point system was genius
2020000	2022000	It's great, it's wonderful
2022000	2024000	And now we look at what Playstation 3 is doing
2024000	2026000	And we go, hmm, the Microsoft thing kind of seems
2026000	2028000	Kind of not as good as it could be now
2028000	2030000	Next to that
2030000	2032000	They just have the problem of being there first
2032000	2034000	Yeah, I guess so
2034000	2036000	It's just interesting
2036000	2038000	I still like achievements
2038000	2040000	I still love 360
2040000	2042000	But it's just kind of interesting that Sony could still do that
2042000	2044000	Even with all this negative press
2044000	2046000	Wow, they really kind of did rip something off
2046000	2048000	And make it better
2048000	2050000	One thing to keep in mind is that with the
2050000	2052000	As we progress
2052000	2054000	As more and more and more ideas come out
2054000	2056000	After a while it's very hard to innovate
2056000	2058000	Once you've already thought of what you can do
2058000	2060000	The only other thing you can do
2060000	2062000	Is expand on the idea
2062000	2064000	We've never seen Nintendo doing this
2064000	2066000	Because they can't embrace online
2066000	2068000	So
2068000	2070000	Who cares?
2070000	2072000	Well, I'm still thinking
2072000	2074000	I will probably end up
2074000	2076000	Breaking down and buying a Playstation 3
2076000	2078000	When some of the games I want
2078000	2080000	Come out like Final Fantasy 13
2080000	2082000	But I don't
2082000	2084000	Think I still want to run out and buy a Playstation 3
2084000	2086000	Just yet for only this
2086000	2088000	Although I think it's really cool
2088000	2090000	And if you are thinking about buying a Playstation 3
2090000	2092000	For only this
2092000	2094000	You need to wait until this stuff comes out
2094000	2096000	Because a lot can change
2096000	2098000	They can promise the moon for you
2098000	2100000	But they can deliver shit
2100000	2102000	Honestly
2102000	2104000	I think E3 this year
2104000	2106000	For Sony is so critical
2106000	2108000	Because I think they need to make up
2108000	2110000	For Zonkin out last year
2110000	2112000	And I think this year at E3
2112000	2114000	Now that they've kind of set the stage
2114000	2116000	Because that's kind of what they do with the game developers
2116000	2118000	Is they've kind of set the stage
2118000	2120000	Everything around, the big case
2120000	2122000	That Playstation 3 is going to
2122000	2124000	The big central thing now
2124000	2126000	That Playstation 3 is going to have
2126000	2128000	It's going to be about the games
2128000	2130000	That needs to come out at E3 and say
2130000	2132000	Here's the exclusives
2132000	2134000	Here's the first party stuff we're developing
2134000	2136000	Here's the stuff that's going to really make you want
2136000	2138000	A Playstation 3 now
2138000	2140000	Because I think about all these trailers and things we saw
2140000	2142000	At E3 last year
2142000	2144000	That we really have never heard about again ever since
2144000	2146000	Maybe little bits and pieces here and there
2146000	2148000	Africa with a K
2148000	2150000	Can we find out why I need Africa
2150000	2152000	And why this game is going to be so flipping great
2152000	2154000	Because when we saw the trailer before
2154000	2156000	We were like, I don't get it
2156000	2158000	I think about that game
2158000	2160000	I can't even remember what the hell the name of it was
2160000	2162000	Remember the trailer showed the gas station blowing up
2162000	2164000	Or something in the cars
2164000	2166000	What was that with the two guys
2166000	2168000	It looked kind of neat
2168000	2170000	What the hell was that?
2170000	2172000	Where did it go?
2172000	2174000	I guess so
2174000	2176000	I went to vaporware land
2176000	2178000	I just think it's so important
2178000	2180000	For Sony to come to E3
2180000	2182000	Now saying, now you know the box
2182000	2184000	That we're putting this in
2184000	2186000	The box off with games
2186000	2188000	And that truly is going to get me rah rah rah
2188000	2190000	About Sony again
2190000	2192000	I'm kind of curious
2192000	2194000	Has your guys' opinion of Sony changed at all
2194000	2196000	From the home run they hit at Game Developers Conference
2196000	2198000	Loki?
2198000	2200000	It's about time that they did something right
2200000	2202000	So that's great
2202000	2204000	Originally when I heard about home
2204000	2206000	I thought it was going to be a rip off of
2206000	2208000	The Miis
2208000	2210000	No, not at all
2210000	2212000	Now it's a rip off of Second Life
2212000	2214000	They took a business model, at least they took the right one
2214000	2216000	Because Second Life is
2216000	2218000	Really successful
2218000	2220000	As far as people making money off of it
2220000	2222000	As soon as I saw
2222000	2224000	Oh yeah, you're going to be able to buy clothing and stuff like that
2224000	2226000	On the service
2226000	2228000	And actually customize your characters
2228000	2230000	I'm like, oh well, cha-ching
2230000	2232000	Basically
2232000	2234000	They're going to make a lot of money
2234000	2236000	I think it's great
2236000	2238000	I do like the way that you can jump in
2238000	2240000	And play multiplayer games
2240000	2242000	Just by meeting people
2242000	2244000	So that's kind of cool
2244000	2246000	I don't know
2246000	2248000	They just wait to see what they do with it
2248000	2250000	Because they've been talking to a lot of online communities
2250000	2252000	With their games coming out
2252000	2254000	It's just going to be
2254000	2256000	Interesting to see how they implement everything
2256000	2258000	We are going to open up our Skype
2258000	2260000	Line in a rare occurrence here
2260000	2262000	Just to get your feedback on this component
2262000	2264000	Because I think this is so big
2264000	2266000	Especially with all the
2266000	2268000	Whining
2268000	2270000	Just kicking of Sony while they're down
2270000	2272000	People have been doing
2272000	2274000	I'm really curious to see what our listeners think
2274000	2276000	About this whole thing going in the other direction
2276000	2278000	We are going to take some real quick calls
2278000	2280000	Before that though I want to get some chat comments
2280000	2282000	If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR
2282000	2284000	Or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype
2284000	2286000	And then I want to hear what Jamie has to say on this as well
2286000	2288000	First let me get some chat comments here
2288000	2290000	Let's see
2290000	2292000	I was saying that somebody here
2292000	2294000	Said something really good up above
2294000	2296000	Sorry guys, live radio scrolling around
2296000	2298000	There it is
2298000	2300000	Rob D said
2300000	2302000	This doesn't matter to me
2302000	2304000	I need games
2304000	2306000	Not a Trojan Horse Media Center
2306000	2308000	Give me games
2308000	2310000	It would be a good bonus
2310000	2312000	Let's see
2312000	2314000	Allusion says yeah a new Sims game comes out
2314000	2316000	And someone says I like the Sims better
2316000	2318000	When it was called PlayStation Home
2318000	2320000	I think kind of making a joke about
2320000	2322000	How Sony kind of rips things off and does it better
2322000	2324000	Let's see
2324000	2326000	The game is shallow and sucks except for resistance
2326000	2328000	Even now
2328000	2330000	Zappy I believe saved the day there
2330000	2332000	Earlier in chat Zappy believes that the game
2332000	2334000	I was talking about was called 8 days
2334000	2336000	That sounds right
2336000	2338000	That does sound right to me as well
2338000	2340000	Dark Soccer do you have anything you want to
2340000	2342000	Say about the whole Sony
2342000	2344000	Has your opinion of them changed?
2344000	2346000	Or you still think they are eating crayons over there or what?
2346000	2348000	I still think they are eating crayons
2348000	2350000	But this is a step away from the crayons
2350000	2352000	I think that they have moved away from crayons
2352000	2354000	They are eating paste
2354000	2356000	Because paste at least
2356000	2358000	Is flour based
2358000	2360000	They are eating
2360000	2362000	Paste in those little
2362000	2364000	Star shaped
2364000	2366000	String cheese nuggets
2366000	2368000	Let's go to the skype line
2368000	2370000	And see what people think on this
2370000	2372000	Who is this?
2372000	2374000	Ravenstaufen
2374000	2376000	What do you think about Sony at
2376000	2378000	GDC?
2378000	2380000	It's definitely a step in the right direction
2380000	2382000	Are you a Playstation 3 owner currently?
2382000	2384000	I wish, no
2384000	2386000	But you say you wish now
2386000	2388000	No I have been wishing
2388000	2390000	So does this make you want it even more?
2390000	2392000	Yeah
2392000	2394000	What do you think
2394000	2396000	Is going to be the coolest thing
2396000	2398000	About everything that came out of GDC?
2398000	2400000	What are you looking forward to doing with
2400000	2402000	Home or with LittleBigPlanet?
2402000	2404000	I thought Home was a
2404000	2406000	Very good idea
2406000	2408000	The only thing I want to do is stream porn from my hard drive
2408000	2410000	To my TV
2410000	2412000	You can kind of do that anyway
2412000	2414000	I don't know about the hard drive on your computer
2414000	2416000	I think you can stream the movies on your TV
2416000	2418000	But I'm looking at some FAQs
2418000	2420000	That came out about it
2420000	2422000	One of the questions that was posed about Playstation Home
2422000	2424000	Can I launch and watch a
2424000	2426000	BD movie from within Home?
2426000	2428000	Launch yes, watch no
2428000	2430000	I think some people were thinking that you would be able to put
2430000	2432000	A porno on the TV in your apartment
2432000	2434000	And that would play
2434000	2436000	Well you could go to that and launch the movie
2436000	2438000	But it won't actually play the porno in your apartment
2438000	2440000	At least that's the impression I'm getting
2440000	2442000	Which seems, the logistics of that seems like it would be
2442000	2444000	A real bandwidth eater anyway
2444000	2446000	So it's probably for the best, right?
2446000	2448000	I got bandwidth
2448000	2450000	I think it will actually stream whatever it is
2450000	2452000	On that TV because they said they had dynamic
2452000	2454000	Well, I forget if it was like
2454000	2456000	Dynamic sound or something like that where
2456000	2458000	As you walk closer to the source it will get louder
2458000	2460000	And that kind of thing
2460000	2462000	What do you think should be
2462000	2464000	Sony's next move, Raven's Dolphin?
2464000	2466000	What should they do at E3?
2466000	2468000	I don't know
2468000	2470000	I think they should definitely put Home
2470000	2472000	In a good response but I definitely agree
2472000	2474000	That any games
2474000	2476000	Like to support the Home
2476000	2478000	More games that support Home would be a home run
2478000	2480000	So maybe some games that incorporate the Home thing
2480000	2482000	Because one thing that's interesting about what Sony
2482000	2484000	Is doing versus what Microsoft is doing
2484000	2486000	Is Microsoft requires developers
2486000	2488000	To put achievements in the games
2488000	2490000	Sony is just kind of letting it be there
2490000	2492000	And if the developers want to
2492000	2494000	Put things in it then great
2494000	2496000	If when you beat Final Fantasy 13
2496000	2498000	Let's say if Square wants to
2498000	2500000	Give you a little cloud sword
2500000	2502000	Even though cloud's not in Final Fantasy 13
2502000	2504000	I don't know, humor me here for a minute
2504000	2506000	A little cloud sword that you could put in your PlayStation Home
2506000	2508000	That would be up to them completely
2508000	2510000	So kind of interesting
2510000	2512000	Yeah, two more things
2512000	2514000	Alright, hurry
2514000	2516000	You have to buy a Bluetooth headset and a USB
2516000	2518000	Are you?
2518000	2520000	I already have one for my 360
2520000	2522000	It's going to be a tough sell on Sony
2522000	2524000	Sony will need to tell me why I need it
2524000	2526000	Okay, and
2526000	2528000	The next thing about the trophies
2528000	2530000	Did you see that room?
2530000	2532000	I saw some of the videos
2532000	2534000	It looked like one room had a crap load of trophies
2534000	2536000	Maybe from all the arcade titles
2536000	2538000	I don't know
2538000	2540000	And one thing from Second Life
2540000	2542000	Am I going to launch pink dicks at people
2542000	2544000	That I don't like?
2544000	2546000	I have a feeling since this community is going to be a little more moderated
2546000	2548000	Probably not
2548000	2550000	With Second Life you can kind of user create things
2550000	2552000	I haven't done a lot of Second Life
2552000	2554000	But there's more user creation in that
2554000	2556000	I don't think you really get that so much here
2556000	2558000	You get user customization
2558000	2560000	But not so much creation
2560000	2562000	Alright, thanks so much for the call Ravenstaufen
2562000	2564000	You're welcome
2564000	2566000	Alright, we'll take one more call and some feedback with the Sony stuff
2566000	2568000	1877 Game OLR
2568000	2570000	Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio
2570000	2572000	Over on Skype
2572000	2574000	Of course we encourage you guys to interact with our program
2574000	2576000	That's what we're here for
2576000	2578000	We're just three folks that like video games
2578000	2580000	Just like the rest of you
2580000	2582000	We want to hear what you guys have to say as well
2582000	2584000	Let's take another call
2584000	2586000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
2586000	2588000	Hey, it's SSJ100Matt
2588000	2590000	Hi SSJ100Matt, what do you think about this whole Sony home thing?
2590000	2592000	Actually, I'm liking it a lot
2592000	2594000	You're liking it a lot?
2594000	2600000	Were you somebody that wanted a Playstation 3 before Game Developers Conference?
2600000	2608000	I actually know originally I was split between a 360 and a PS3
2608000	2610000	So what do you think now?
2610000	2616000	Well now I've got to start thinking about the PS3 now
2616000	2620000	Before I was like majority 360
2620000	2622000	Now I'm back in the middle
2622000	2627000	So I'm going to wait until this home thing picks up around October
2627000	2629000	And then I'll make a decision
2629000	2632000	What about home that puts you back in the middle with all this?
2632000	2636000	Originally I used to play The Sims a lot
2636000	2639000	That was basically my guilty pleasure
2639000	2641000	That thing was like crack
2641000	2643000	This is kind of like The Sims
2643000	2648000	I know I'm going to be on this thing customizing buying crap
2648000	2652000	To make my place look good
2652000	2654000	Speaking of customizing LittleBigPlanet
2654000	2656000	Is that something that appeals to you?
2656000	2659000	It looks really nice, I think it will be great
2659000	2667000	Because I think they said something that they're going to come out with a full version
2667000	2672000	Where it's just going to basically be user created courses
2672000	2675000	And bring that out in retail or something
2675000	2677000	I think it's going to be very interesting to see how that plays out
2677000	2679000	When it's actually out there on the marketplace
2679000	2684000	Because now it seems like Sony is starting to listen to people
2684000	2688000	And they're going to be more welcome to user created things
2688000	2691000	Thanks so much for the call SSJ100 Matt
2691000	2693000	We've got to get back to the news
2693000	2694000	But take care
2694000	2695000	Take it easy
2695000	2697000	We'd love to take more calls
2697000	2699000	But we will take calls later in the show during part B
2699000	2701000	And if you want to talk about Sony home at that time
2701000	2702000	Certainly you can
2702000	2704000	But we need to get back into some news, right Jamie?
2704000	2706000	Yeah, news would be a good thing
2706000	2710000	I need to cleanse the palette of Sony
2710000	2714000	I sense a little bitterness about Sony within you
2714000	2717000	The bitterness is strong with this one
2717000	2718000	It always has been
2718000	2721000	But speaking of things that are a little less bitter
2721000	2725000	Is that in Fable 2, which will be coming out
2725000	2727000	You can have a dog
2727000	2729000	And he walks around with you
2729000	2733000	And he growls when he smells the people sneaking up on you
2733000	2735000	And you can't really tell him what to do
2735000	2738000	But you can gesture to him and he'll learn to follow
2738000	2740000	Well, he'll always follow you
2740000	2743000	But he'll go along with you and be your puppy
2743000	2745000	And lick your face and eat your chickens
2745000	2746000	And that type of thing
2746000	2747000	Wait, he'll eat your chickens?
2747000	2748000	I don't know
2748000	2749000	That's not good
2749000	2752000	Do the chickens fight back like they did in Zelda?
2752000	2754000	I don't know
2754000	2759000	But I wish they had cats
2759000	2761000	That was kind of disappointing
2761000	2762000	Because I'm more of a cat person
2762000	2765000	But then again I suppose the cat would control you
2765000	2770000	Apparently you can also be a pregnant woman
2770000	2772000	And catch diseases
2772000	2775000	You can get knocked up within Fable 2?
2775000	2777000	You can have sex, you can have unprotected sex
2777000	2781000	And protected sex, you can get STDs
2781000	2784000	That's making the fantasy out of my game
2784000	2787000	How many different kinds of sex can you have?
2787000	2789000	Is there going to be a whole Kama Sutra?
2789000	2790000	Hot Monkey
2790000	2792000	Will butt sex be involved?
2792000	2795000	They had gay relationships in the first game
2795000	2797000	Butt sex is not just a gay thing
2797000	2799000	Well, that's true
2799000	2800000	Good point
2800000	2802000	The dog is pretty awesome
2802000	2804000	They're saying that you're actually going to care for this dog
2804000	2807000	It loves you
2807000	2811000	And it will try to keep you safe
2811000	2812000	And stuff like that
2812000	2813000	It's pretty cool
2813000	2816000	They have some videos on gamevideos.com
2816000	2821000	Basically talking about the whole dog aspect of the game
2821000	2823000	It just looks awesome, I really want it
2823000	2825000	It's way better than in 10 Dogs
2825000	2829000	DDRDollarBill says
2829000	2831000	I want to have sex without E-Herpes
2831000	2833000	And DDRDollarBill says
2833000	2835000	Surprise butt sex?
2835000	2837000	I guess that's something you could do in the game
2837000	2839000	Surprise butt sex on people
2839000	2840000	I don't know, probably not
2840000	2842000	I just don't know
2842000	2846000	If I were going to have something useful I'd have a pet wolf
2846000	2848000	SSJ100Matt says
2848000	2850000	Do we get extra points for donkey punching?
2850000	2851000	I want a pit bull
2851000	2853000	And NM64 says
2853000	2855000	Everyone has AIDS
2855000	2858000	Because if you're allowed to run around and have unprotected sex in the game
2858000	2859000	That's the likely conclusion
2859000	2862000	I wonder if you could start an epidemic in the game
2862000	2864000	It's kind of weird
2864000	2866000	But I suppose this answers the question now about
2866000	2868000	What was the big secret about Fable?
2868000	2871000	It was puppy dogs and diseases
2871000	2872000	I guess so, there you have it
2872000	2874000	DDRDollarBill says
2874000	2879000	You're going to have to buy your condoms with your MS points
2879000	2880000	That's funny
2880000	2882000	Little microtransactions out the wazoo
2882000	2884000	Yeah, maybe you'll be able to get a cat
2884000	2886000	But you'll have to pay some points for it, I don't know
2886000	2888000	Alright
2888000	2889000	Well, there was
2889000	2891000	You have to change the litter or you die of methane poisoning
2891000	2894000	There were some other announcements that came out of Game Developers Conference
2894000	2897000	And I love me some Mizuguchi
2897000	2901000	Of course Mizuguchi, the fine fellow who created Rez
2901000	2903000	I believe Space Channel 5
2903000	2905000	Luminous
2905000	2906000	Meteos
2906000	2909000	Some of the greatest games, 99 Nights, not so much
2909000	2910000	Feeling the love there
2910000	2912000	But everybody's allowed to make a mistake
2912000	2914000	Well, this Make No Mistake here
2914000	2919000	Every Xtend Xtra Xtreme is coming to Xbox Live Arcade
2919000	2923000	And it looks like the audio and visual sex capade
2923000	2925000	That you would be expecting from Mizuguchi
2925000	2928000	I mean, just kind of look at these screenshots here
2928000	2931000	Of course, every Xtend Xtra was a game that was out on the PSP
2931000	2935000	They're going to be making this version as well for Xbox Live Arcade
2935000	2937000	And of course they're calling it E4 for short
2937000	2940000	Because every Xtend Xtra Xtreme get it, there's all the Es there
2940000	2945000	They're going to be able to battle others in an online versus mode
2945000	2948000	And that's kind of something that's a little new there for Xbox Live
2948000	2950000	Of course, just look at how trippy that looks
2950000	2954000	I mean, this is going to be an amazing seizure playable game
2954000	2957000	But I really like every Xtend Xtra on the PSP
2957000	2959000	It's kind of a unique sort of game
2959000	2960000	It's not really a puzzle
2960000	2961000	It's like a
2961000	2963000	I mean, it has puzzle elements
2963000	2964000	You have to think about what you're doing
2964000	2966000	But it is kind of an action game
2966000	2967000	So it's unique
2967000	2969000	And I'm a big supporter of unique games
2969000	2972000	So this is a perfect announcement for Game Developers Conference
2972000	2975000	So check that out on Xbox Live Marketplace
2975000	2976000	When it becomes available
2976000	2978000	Probably later this year
2978000	2979000	At least as far as we know
2979000	2981000	Yeah, late later this year
2981000	2982000	Christmas
2982000	2983000	Christmas
2983000	2987000	Anyways, one thing though that's making games like this possible
2987000	2990000	Is the fact that Microsoft has officially raised the file limit
2990000	2992000	Of the Xbox Live Arcade games
2992000	2994000	Originally it was 50 megabytes
2994000	2998000	To fit on that wonderful 64 megabyte memory unit
2998000	3002000	Of course, now that they've also announced a larger memory unit
3002000	3004000	Which is going to be 512 megabytes
3006000	3008000	Now they can have games that are even bigger
3008000	3011000	Including games up to 150 megabytes
3011000	3013000	And even higher with permission
3013000	3015000	So that's excellent
3015000	3017000	And I know one of the first games to actually utilize that
3017000	3019000	Was going to be Symphony of the Night
3019000	3021000	Because I think that was like 98 megabytes
3021000	3023000	Yeah, that's when these rumors started
3023000	3025000	Because of Castlevania
3025000	3028000	I had thought that Microsoft already confirmed this
3028000	3031000	So I was kind of surprised to see this making the rounds on news sites again
3031000	3032000	Well, they sort of confirmed it
3032000	3034000	And then they made a press release about it
3034000	3036000	So now it's official official
3036000	3038000	These stages of gaming news
3038000	3040000	Especially Microsoft gaming news
3040000	3043000	Because Microsoft news always starts out as a rumor first
3043000	3046000	Because Microsoft rumors 99% of the time are true
3046000	3048000	So there's a Microsoft rumor
3048000	3051000	And then it evolves into random dude at Microsoft
3051000	3054000	Or a Microsoft blogger said, yeah, we're working on it, shh, don't tell
3054000	3057000	And then it evolves into like a press release
3057000	3059000	And then it's like, oh, it's official now
3059000	3063000	Microsoft has said, hail the larger Xbox Live arcade games
3063000	3067000	I'm sure every XtendXtra will benefit from that 150 megabytes
3067000	3069000	Here's the other thing I want to know though
3069000	3072000	Now that the arcade limit has been upped
3072000	3074000	Mr. Mizuguchi and everybody over at Q Entertainment
3074000	3076000	Whatever happened
3076000	3081000	It's been like a year now, whatever happened to Madonna in Luminous?
3081000	3083000	And I'm not just saying Madonna specifically
3083000	3086000	Contrary to popular belief, I could give two shits about Madonna
3086000	3089000	But I'm talking about the licensed music in general
3089000	3093000	We got one song, Heavenly Star, which was an in-house thing anyway
3093000	3096000	Where's the rest of the content that's supposed to be in Luminous?
3096000	3097000	No content for you
3097000	3098000	I guess not
3098000	3099000	Sorry, I got on a tangent there
3099000	3101000	This is supposed to be about the thing
3101000	3103000	Talking about Mizuguchi made me think about that
3103000	3106000	What the hell ever happened to Madonna, etc.
3106000	3107000	The puppy ate it
3107000	3110000	I guess so, the dog ate it
3110000	3116000	Well, you know something that you don't really have to worry about
3116000	3119000	Well, I don't know, I'm sort of worried about this
3119000	3125000	Peter Jackson is doing some episodic content for a couple of Xbox 360 games
3125000	3126000	And one of them is Halo
3126000	3129000	And I'm wondering, dude, what's he going to do for Halo?
3129000	3131000	That'd be very interesting
3131000	3133000	There's not too many details about it
3133000	3135000	And I don't think anything on what the other game is
3135000	3138000	It looks like it's still in development
3138000	3142000	But I don't know, is it going to involve giant monkeys?
3142000	3146000	Well, if you know Peter Jackson is doing it, you know it's going to be long
3146000	3150000	Like three and a half hour, butt-numbingly long
3150000	3154000	Like certain movies that he's made
3154000	3158000	In fact, most all the movies he's made in the past few years
3158000	3159000	God, seriously
3159000	3162000	Don't get me wrong, Lord of the Rings is cool and all
3162000	3164000	But damn, those are some long movies
3164000	3170000	It seems like episodic content has become this real buzzword of the past couple of years, hasn't it?
3170000	3172000	It seems like everybody and their mom is doing episodic content
3172000	3176000	What could they really do for Halo episodic content, you think?
3176000	3181000	Do you think this is something they'll do like two and then say, oh, there was your episodic content?
3181000	3183000	Or is this something you could see actually going on for a while?
3183000	3186000	I mean, God, if any community could support something like this though
3186000	3188000	The Halo community is huge and loud
3188000	3190000	I would see this happening like after Halo 3
3190000	3193000	And it would be for Halo 3, not its own game
3193000	3196000	Just like additional story, single player stuff
3196000	3198000	Or co-op missions or stuff like that
3198000	3202000	It's kind of similar to the co-op missions in Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
3202000	3203000	Or something like that
3203000	3207000	It's not really episodic content, it's just downloadable content later on
3207000	3213000	Because to be honest, there aren't that many episodic content games out there
3213000	3215000	I mean, even Half-Life or whatever
3215000	3219000	They're only up to episode two and two hasn't even come out yet
3219000	3221000	You know I'm going to say Sam and Max
3221000	3224000	Sam and Max, yeah, that's one that's actually pretty good
3224000	3226000	But what else besides that?
3226000	3230000	I agree, Sam and Max is the only ones that seem to be doing it right
3230000	3234000	It's a buzzword thrown out there a lot and it's not being done
3234000	3238000	I mean, it's just like digital distribution for movies and stuff
3238000	3240000	Everyone talks about it, but it's hardly done
3240000	3243000	We've got to check in with the chat room because there are some funnies
3243000	3246000	Of course, going back to me bitching about the whole Luminous thing
3246000	3249000	Joshi16 kind of combined the stories together and says
3249000	3252000	Madonna would give you the Herpes achievement, Sky
3252000	3256000	So insinuating that maybe Madonna will actually be in Fable
3256000	3259000	To give you the STDs that you can get inside the game
3259000	3262000	So that's certainly an interesting thought from Joshi16
3262000	3265000	Let's see, Lazer is a winner for this reference
3265000	3268000	Maybe the Dingo ate your content
3268000	3271000	Ahh!
3271000	3273000	Now I'm getting all Meryl Streep
3273000	3275000	The Dingo ate the baby!
3275000	3277000	Anyway, let's see
3277000	3280000	You're so a winner for that comment
3280000	3282000	What else was there about episodic content?
3282000	3285000	I thought it was very interesting here in chat room
3285000	3288000	Well, Firesafety says there are already giant monkeys in Halo
3288000	3292000	So I guess you can't really say that that's what Peter Jackson is going to bring to the table
3292000	3295000	Let's see
3295000	3299000	Firesafety also says hopefully it's nothing like Half-Life 2 periodic
3299000	3301000	yearly maybe content
3301000	3305000	Funnydale says episodic content equals 3 hour games every year
3305000	3307000	Yep, that's basically what it's been so far
3307000	3310000	So I'm hoping Halo will break that mold
3310000	3313000	We'll see
3313000	3317000	Well, this is not a happy story here
3317000	3320000	But some news came out about Castle Crashers
3320000	3323000	Loki, you were all excited about Castle Crashers
3323000	3325000	Because this is the game that kind of looks like
3325000	3327000	It looks like an old school arcade
3327000	3329000	Hit the buttons, hack and slash type thing
3329000	3332000	Like a brand new one, this looks awesome
3332000	3335000	Well, when approached
3335000	3338000	Behemoth's Dan Paladin
3338000	3340000	They won actually an IGF award
3340000	3342000	Dan Paladin actually commented on the game
3342000	3345000	He noted that the Xbox Live title still had
3345000	3348000	About a year of development left
3348000	3350000	Meaning the Castle Crashers
3350000	3353000	Looks like it will now be out in 2008
3353000	3358000	But now the good news about this is that since the size limit has been increased
3358000	3361000	One reason that's been kind of a conclusion
3361000	3363000	That's been jumped to over this is that
3363000	3365000	Oh, they're going to go back and make the game bigger
3365000	3366000	Thanks to the size increase
3366000	3370000	So maybe good things will come to those who wait in terms of what's there
3370000	3373000	So I know you were really anxious about this game, Loki
3373000	3376000	Are you okay with this delay if it's going to make the game better?
3376000	3377000	Are you pissed?
3377000	3380000	Do you wish they just released something now and maybe do a Castle Crashers 2?
3380000	3383000	Oh, I'm fine with them delaying the game
3383000	3385000	Most likely even if it wasn't because of this
3385000	3388000	It would be delayed for some other reason
3388000	3389000	I mean, who cares?
3389000	3391000	There's supposedly more content coming out now
3391000	3394000	So I'm fine holding off on that
3394000	3396000	I mean, it's one of those games that look neat
3396000	3398000	I wasn't like, oh, I gotta have this now
3398000	3401000	I mean, big deal
3401000	3402000	I don't know, I can wait
3402000	3403000	Alright
3403000	3405000	Well, I don't know
3405000	3408000	But game delays, they kind of get me a little bit angsty
3408000	3410000	I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but you know
3410000	3412000	Anytime a game I look forward to gets delayed
3412000	3414000	Whether it be for the right reason or not
3414000	3415000	I get a little pissed off
3415000	3416000	What about you?
3416000	3417000	Um, sometimes
3417000	3420000	So that means that because we're pissed off
3420000	3421000	Well, this is one of those times, DarkSakura
3421000	3423000	Help me out here, because we got a segue
3423000	3424000	Roar!
3424000	3426000	Thank you, and to the FUs of the Week
3426000	3436000	Music
3436000	3441000	My FU of the Week is, as usual, traffic-based
3441000	3445000	Fuck you to men with small penises who drive big trucks
3445000	3448000	And also fuck you to sacramoms who drive SUVs
3448000	3449000	I leave it at that
3449000	3451000	Moki!
3451000	3456000	Fuck the fact that I can't find two files for Pop Station
3456000	3458000	For the PSP
3458000	3461000	And those are two important files that I need to make things work
3461000	3463000	I did find, however, though, there is one game that I have
3463000	3465000	That I really should put on my PSP
3465000	3467000	And that is Einhendr
3467000	3469000	Because that would be fucking awesome
3471000	3472000	That's it
3472000	3473000	Alright
3473000	3474000	I didn't have really anything that
3474000	3478000	Oh, fuck to the fact that this room is like a scorching
3478000	3479000	I don't know
3479000	3480000	I think somebody turned the fan off
3480000	3481000	I'm gonna go check that
3481000	3482000	It's like fucking hot in here
3482000	3483000	It is
3483000	3484000	It's just me
3484000	3485000	No, I know
3485000	3486000	I'm bringing them here too
3486000	3488000	I'll go look at the temperature in a minute
3488000	3490000	But I want to say my FU of the Week would go to
3490000	3492000	Daylight Savings Time
3492000	3494000	Oh my god
3494000	3496000	Ugh, I hate Daylight Savings Time
3497000	3499000	How dare you rob me of an hour of my sleep
3499000	3502000	I don't care if there's farmer kids with school
3502000	3504000	Or whatever the hell reason they say
3504000	3505000	Energy consumption
3505000	3507000	Whatever the hell excuse they have
3507000	3509000	FU Daylight Savings Time
3509000	3510000	I'm dying of fire
3510000	3513000	Hey, that was a pretty short FUs of the Week segment
3513000	3515000	I'm kind of sad a little bit
3515000	3518000	Well, don't be sad
3518000	3519000	Anyways
3519000	3522000	There's one reason you shouldn't be sad
3522000	3524000	Xbox Live hit six million users
3524000	3529000	They apparently did this four months earlier than they had expected
3529000	3531000	And not a big surprise
3531000	3534000	Because, you know, they offer those two day subscriptions
3534000	3536000	And pretty much anyone that plugs in
3536000	3540000	You know, their console into the internet
3540000	3543000	They are logged into Xbox Live
3543000	3547000	So, and they didn't really say what the six million mark meant
3547000	3551000	I mean, whether that's going to be silver or gold or whatever
3551000	3553000	Um, I don't know
3553000	3555000	So, take it with a grain of salt
3555000	3557000	But yay, there's lots of people on live
3557000	3560000	That's all you need to know, I guess
3560000	3563000	More people to flash us their ass, you know
3563000	3564000	On the camera
3564000	3565000	Hooray
3565000	3566000	Yay ass
3566000	3568000	Speaking of which, how have you noticed?
3568000	3570000	The camera for the 360
3570000	3573000	Completely useless, like the iToy
3573000	3575000	I have kind of noticed
3575000	3577000	What about Rayman Raving Rabbids on the 360?
3577000	3581000	Oh, I'm guessing that's going to be about as good as any iToy game
3581000	3583000	That's a damn good point
3583000	3586000	When was the last time anyone said anything about the Xbox Live camera?
3586000	3590000	And why is it we haven't gotten more games like Uno?
3590000	3593000	You would think, based on the success of Uno
3593000	3596000	That we would have seen like, you know, we would see like Old Maid
3596000	3598000	And like freaking Skip Bow
3598000	3601000	And I don't know, whatever else card games and casual games they can come up with
3601000	3603000	On Xbox Live by now
3603000	3605000	Is it just a rights thing? I don't know
3605000	3607000	It's lame
3607000	3609000	Well
3609000	3613000	There are though some things that are not quite as lame as that
3613000	3617000	Although there's not many things that are really as lame as that
3617000	3619000	Um
3619000	3622000	Some news for our European listeners though
3622000	3624000	You know, we've been talking about Blue Dragon
3624000	3630000	It's going to be released in very likely September in Europe
3630000	3633000	As was announced at a game developers conference
3633000	3635000	Isn't that cool?
3635000	3638000	And I'm thinking that I've actually been really excited about this
3638000	3640000	You know
3640000	3642000	I mean, I'm still sort of back and forth
3642000	3645000	But we have to wait until August to get it
3645000	3650000	And so I think by then I'll decide whether or not I really am going to be able to dedicate the time to another RPG
3650000	3652000	I think it's going to be awesome
3652000	3656000	I think there were a couple more details on Blue Dragon this week
3656000	3658000	Because I thought about, Loki, you said
3658000	3661000	Already on this show like a month ago that Blue Dragon was coming out over here
3661000	3663000	I think you might have said July
3663000	3665000	But whatever, it got delayed a couple weeks, big whoop, right?
3665000	3667000	But we all knew it was coming over here
3667000	3670000	But I seem to remember one cool thing that I remember reading about Blue Dragon
3670000	3675000	Is that they're going to have both the English language and Japanese language tracks in it
3675000	3677000	Kind of like how Enchanted Arms had
3677000	3681000	So if you're one of those people that's like, I hate it when they dub this stuff in English
3681000	3682000	Because blah blah blah blah blah
3682000	3684000	Then fine, you can watch the Japanese stuff with subtitles
3684000	3686000	Everyone's happy
3686000	3689000	So I'm actually really looking forward to Blue Dragon
3689000	3691000	Just because, you know, how could you not be?
3691000	3694000	It's, you know, the team that made the original Final Fantasy
3694000	3696000	Kind of, I don't know
3696000	3698000	I'm very excited about it
3698000	3700000	Looking at chat room to see what's going on there in chat
3700000	3702000	Let's see
3702000	3705000	Joshi16 will not let the Madonna thing go
3705000	3708000	Because Joshi says Madonna needs a live arcade camera game
3708000	3711000	Dude, you need to get your issues worked out there with Madonna
3711000	3714000	Let's see, what else do we have here?
3714000	3717000	Blaze says simply fuck the Xbox Live camera
3717000	3718000	There you have it
3718000	3721000	Mori agrees, Xbox 360 skip bow would be amazing
3721000	3724000	You know what would be more amazing than Xbox 360 skip bow?
3724000	3726000	And props to you if you know this game
3726000	3728000	I might be horribly pronouncing it because it's French
3728000	3730000	But this is like my favorite card game ever
3730000	3733000	Xbox 360 Millborn
3733000	3735000	You ever played that game?
3735000	3738000	With the roll and stop and punctured tires
3738000	3739000	It's like a racing card game
3739000	3740000	No
3740000	3741000	Oh my god, it's the best game ever
3741000	3742000	I love that card game
3742000	3746000	Bring me my Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade
3746000	3748000	Sorry
3748000	3749000	I'm ranting tonight
3749000	3751000	I'm a demanding little bitch tonight
3751000	3752000	I'm sorry
3752000	3754000	I'll be good
3757000	3758000	Alright
3758000	3761000	Oh I'm sorry, we got a release date to talk about
3761000	3762000	Wow
3762000	3763000	Live Radio
3763000	3767000	See I get all ranty and then I completely forget about talking about release dates
3767000	3770000	But I suppose we should talk about the Japanese release dates
3770000	3774000	Because these are usually the things that we're going to see over here in the US before too long
3774000	3776000	Or over in Europe as well
3776000	3779000	Well coming out on the Xbox 360, not a lot
3779000	3783000	Except some games are going into the Platinum Collection on March 15th
3783000	3787000	So you can now get Battlefield 2, Burnout, Chrome Hounds, Perfect Dark Zero
3787000	3789000	All at a lower price over in Japan
3789000	3793000	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, you get G.I. Jockey Wii is coming out
3793000	3797000	Sonic 2 Himitsu Ring is coming out on March 15th
3797000	3800000	That would just be Sonic and the Secret Rings
3800000	3805000	SpongeBob SquarePants also making its way to Japanese audiences also on March 15th
3805000	3806000	We're sorry Japan
3806000	3808000	Yeah, sorry Japan for that
3808000	3812000	Sometimes things from our culture will stink up your things
3812000	3816000	On the Playstation 3, Fight Night Round 3 making its way to Japan on March 15th
3816000	3819000	As well as a game called Dust Cap 3
3819000	3824000	I don't know about you, but I've never heard of Dust Cap 3
3824000	3828000	That's not a game, that's why
3828000	3831000	Wow, I need help tonight
3831000	3833000	Dust Cap 3 is just an accessory
3833000	3835000	Because I was like, whatever happened to Dust Cap 3?
3835000	3838000	I was like, what the hell is Dust Cap 1 and 2?
3838000	3842000	Sounds like the name of some weird RPG or puzzle game
3842000	3849000	I've never heard of Dust Cap 1 and 2, apparently Dust Cap 3 is literally that
3849000	3850000	Yeah, forget it
3850000	3853000	Also coming out
3853000	3857000	Let's not submit this show for podcast award consideration
3857000	3860000	Because it's just not that good tonight and it's all my fault, I'm sorry
3860000	3863000	Coming out on the Playstation 2
3863000	3866000	Konjiki no Kouda 2 is coming out, also from Koei
3866000	3868000	Big week for Koei Entertainment
3868000	3872000	A game that's going into best hits, I love this title
3872000	3874000	Princess Maker 4 is coming out
3874000	3876000	So if you've ever wanted to be your own princess
3876000	3879000	Now you can for a much lower price
3879000	3882000	I don't think that's exactly what that's about
3882000	3886000	It's called Princess Maker 4
3886000	3888000	Look at the box art
3888000	3890000	Doesn't that look like princesses?
3890000	3892000	Having a good time there?
3892000	3893000	Look at the description
3893000	3898000	Princess Maker 4 is the fourth installment of the popular promotion simulation game
3898000	3900000	In which you become the father guardian of a young girl
3900000	3903000	You must raise her to become a princess in eight years
3903000	3905000	See? It is Princess Maker
3905000	3908000	STFU, you don't know what you're talking about
3908000	3910000	Anyways
3910000	3913000	Wait, I have more
3913000	3916000	Dust Cap 4 is coming out in 2008, look for it
3916000	3918000	No, on Nintendo DS real quick
3918000	3924000	Bionicle Heroes, the Konami Arcade Collection is coming out over there in Japan
3924000	3927000	Also, Kuro Kuro Princess
3927000	3932000	And Lost in Blue 2 is coming out on March 15th as well
3932000	3935000	And Fingerprint Guard Film Light
3935000	3937000	I love that one
3937000	3939000	Just kidding, I knew that wasn't a game
3939000	3941000	Alright, I'm done
3941000	3944000	Anyways, US, pretty much as far as games go
3944000	3946000	There's really one big one this week
3946000	3948000	And that would be God of War 2
3948000	3950000	Coming out in PlayStation 2
3950000	3952000	PSP is not seeing much else either
3952000	3955000	Call of Duty 3 Road to Victory
3955000	3957000	That's going to be coming out as well this week
3957000	3961000	The 360, we're just getting a re-release of Call of Duty 3
3961000	3965000	The Gold Edition, now with downloadable maps
3965000	3968000	Actually included in there, I believe you get tokens for that
3968000	3971000	And some special behind the scenes DVD or something
3971000	3973000	Lame
3973000	3977000	For the PlayStation 3, you're getting College Hoops 2K7
3977000	3979000	Hooray
3979000	3981000	And let's see
3981000	3984000	For PC, quite a bit of stuff coming out
3984000	3987000	None of it looks very good though
3987000	3991000	Some highlights, the Top Spin 2 is coming to the PC
3991000	3994000	Battlefield 2 complete
3994000	3997000	And the rest sucks
3997000	4000000	For the Wii, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07
4000000	4003000	Get your golf on, and then for the DS
4003000	4006000	You have Mind Quiz
4006000	4009000	And that's another ripoff of Brain Age
4009000	4012000	Can I say another game I played this week real quick?
4012000	4016000	I played Quiz and Dragons with Bobby Blackwolf
4016000	4019000	And we were so horrible at that game
4019000	4025000	Words cannot describe the handicap we will need on future games of Quiz and Dragons
4025000	4027000	Which is now on UltraCade apparently
4027000	4029000	Even though UltraCade, you know, we're a little meh
4029000	4033000	But yeah, Quiz and Dragons will own you
4033000	4035000	Herbie Rescue Rally DS
4035000	4038000	Which is a port of a crappy movie
4038000	4040000	Made into a crappy game
4040000	4042000	Now on the DS
4042000	4044000	And it looks crappy
4044000	4046000	That's it
4046000	4048000	I just have to say real quick, sorry chat
4048000	4049000	No Rob
4049000	4050000	It's chat, it's chat
4050000	4053000	The chat room was making fun of my fuck up earlier
4053000	4057000	DarkTetsuya says dustcap 3, dustcap's revenge
4057000	4060000	Fireoboma says dustcap 3 gets more incredible
4060000	4064000	And Illusion makes the mandatory dustcap 3 electric boogaloo
4064000	4067000	That would be dustcap 2
4067000	4070000	Anyway, how about our European releases?
4070000	4071000	How about it?
4071000	4074000	A Bunch of Crap on the 16th
4074000	4076000	Yeah, maybe some of it's kind of crap, some of it's kind of cool
4076000	4080000	We have Call of Duty 3, Championship Manager 2007

4104000	4106000	And also coming out this week in Europe
4106000	4109000	Sorry guys, you're only going to get dustcap 2
4109000	4112000	Because you always get screwed on the release dates and having to wait for things
4112000	4116000	But enjoy dustcap 2, we have been for the last 3 years
4116000	4118000	Sound fair?
4118000	4120000	Very fair
4120000	4124000	We love you overseas listeners, we really do
4124000	4129000	Well another love affair that's going on right now is Electronic Arts and Harmonics
4129000	4134000	And it was just a real brief thing that came out, was leaked to the media this week
4134000	4140000	That Electronic Arts announced they have penned a deal with MTV Networks and Harmonics
4140000	4143000	To publish Harmonics' next game
4143000	4146000	However what that game is, is a secret for now
4146000	4154000	So it's interesting though because obviously Guitar Hero was something that Red Octane published
4154000	4158000	But now EA is going to be filling that role for whatever Harmonics' next game is
4158000	4163000	I seem to remember previously said, and it looks like this article makes reference to it too
4163000	4169000	Harmonics once said that Guitar Hero is just the tip of the iceberg, just the beginning of what these games can become
4169000	4174000	And I seem to remember Harmonics saying that their next project was way bigger than Guitar Hero
4174000	4176000	Like a real thing
4176000	4180000	And a lot of people speculated it's going to be a game that really teaches you how to play guitar
4180000	4182000	I don't know
4182000	4184000	I'm still waiting for Sax Maniacs
4184000	4190000	I kind of wish they'd bring back the Amplitude thing in some new evolved regard
4190000	4192000	Because I did love me some Amplitude
4192000	4197000	They could evolve the game, make it next gen somehow, a little more competitive
4197000	4199000	Crackin' DJ over here
4199000	4202000	Crackin' DJ was not even a Harmonics, that was a Sega game
4202000	4204000	I don't care, it's still fun
4204000	4206000	Crackin' DJ, I haven't heard that in years
4206000	4211000	At least Crackin' DJ sort of made you feel like you were actually remixing stuff
4211000	4215000	Because you were going through the same motions as an actual DJ would
4215000	4217000	So that was kind of neat
4217000	4223000	And I will be kickbanning users in chatroom who said that the game Harmonics is making is Dustcat 4
4223000	4225000	Let the joke die you assholes
4225000	4230000	I think we have the start of a brand new joke to beat into the ground
4230000	4232000	Dustcat 4 bust a cap
4232000	4234000	I saw that in there, that was funny
4234000	4236000	Ha ha ha
4236000	4240000	Anyways, so more EA news of course
4240000	4247000	They are kicking off an online music competition featuring singing sensation Lily Ellen
4247000	4249000	Who the fuck that is?
4249000	4254000	I am not hip to these artists out there
4254000	4259000	Anyways, apparently Lily Ellen, they are doing, I guess this is coincidentally
4259000	4261000	Let me just put this in perspective for people
4261000	4262000	If the music doesn't sound like
4262000	4264000	Puch pooch meow meow meow meow
4264000	4266000	Puch pooch meow meow meow
4266000	4267000	Then Loki doesn't listen to it
4267000	4271000	If it's not cat techno, it's not for me
4271000	4273000	So, anyways
4273000	4280000	Apparently she is doing a version of her song, Smile, for Sims 2
4280000	4285000	Which is going to be in Simlish, which makes it sound even more retarded
4285000	4287000	So, very excellent
4287000	4296000	Just so you know, Lily Allen is a newer artist who has recently peaked at the number 2 position in the UK
4296000	4298000	With her single, Alright, Still
4298000	4301000	And it actually peaked at number 20 here in the US
4301000	4303000	And that is who Lily Allen is
4303000	4306000	And I've seen this, I've probably heard this song before
4306000	4308000	Don't make me pull up a clip
4308000	4311000	To which I would say, alright, still don't care
4311000	4315000	So, but if you do win this contest though
4315000	4321000	You will be winning a prize package worth approximately $1,390
4321000	4329000	And have a chance to record a song in Simlish for possible inclusion in a future Sims 2 game
4329000	4334000	So, great, you get to sing a song in gibberish that's going to appear in a game
4334000	4336000	That probably no one will actually pay attention to the music
4336000	4338000	That sounds awesome
4338000	4340000	I want to sing a song in gibberish
4345000	4347000	That's my song, Lily Allen, are you listening?
4347000	4349000	You could totally sample me on your next record
4352000	4355000	Isn't that like the Strong Bad Lights which rave all of a sudden?
4355000	4356000	So, how about SingStar?
4356000	4360000	Oh, yay, there's another thing I'm looking forward to on the Playstation 3
4360000	4366000	Well, we are having, for SingStar there's going to be a release in the US in fall
4366000	4368000	It's going to be early June in the UK
4368000	4375000	And they are going to be doing this thing called Game 3.0
4375000	4377000	It's a very interesting thing
4377000	4380000	Basically, you're going to be able to download new content
4380000	4383000	But upload content as well using your USB camera
4383000	4385000	You can record videos
4385000	4387000	And then everyone will look at it
4387000	4392000	Like a Numa Numa kid or something
4392000	4397000	Dear God who is in heaven, please listen to this boy's prayer
4397000	4400000	I've been a very good Rob this whole year long
4400000	4404000	Please, please, please God Almighty who art in heaven
4404000	4407000	Please, please make Loki get really drunk one night
4407000	4410000	And record some videos on SingStar
4410000	4413000	And upload them to this Game 3.0 service
4413000	4417000	So that the entirety of the internet can download and make fun of him
4417000	4419000	Thank you, amen
4419000	4420000	What?
4420000	4423000	God doesn't listen to you
4423000	4426000	Come on, Loki, you know you want to do it
4426000	4428000	No, you want me to do that
4428000	4429000	I do
4429000	4430000	I don't want to do that at all
4430000	4432000	I am not touching that fucking game
4432000	4434000	Karaoke will not be entering my house
4434000	4436000	Fuck that shit
4436000	4441000	GS68 says
4441000	4444000	I don't know, it makes me think of a Caturday macro
4444000	4447000	It says, I'm in your OLRs, drunk in your hosts
4447000	4450000	Maybe that's God speaking
4450000	4452000	We all know we're all going to hell
4452000	4453000	Probably
4453000	4455000	Except not me because I don't believe in hell
4455000	4456000	We're going to wherever pagan people go
4456000	4458000	Let's not turn this into a religious
4458000	4459000	We're not a God cast
4459000	4461000	Go look up God cast in iTunes if you want religious stuff
4461000	4463000	We've got to talk about games
4463000	4467000	And one game that we'll talk about here is Warhawk
4467000	4473000	It's interesting because Warhawk went that it was going to be downloadable only when it went over to the Playstation 3
4473000	4475000	Here's the other thing you need to know
4475000	4477000	Warhawk is not going to be single player now
4477000	4480000	It's going to be a multiplayer only battle arena
4480000	4482000	Since the game has moved into the Playstation Network
4482000	4484000	It's a downloadable title
4484000	4487000	It's only going to be something that you can play online
4487000	4489000	But the cool news is that you don't get to just do planes
4489000	4493000	You can do jeeps, tanks, infantry units, and the whole works there
4493000	4495000	So you need to get some other online modes as well
4495000	4498000	But if you don't like to play online games, too bad
4498000	4500000	Warhawk will not be for you on the Playstation 3
4500000	4503000	It's just like Star Fox 64
4503000	4505000	It's like Star Fox is all about flying
4505000	4508000	Now I have to run around and I have tanks and shit
4508000	4511000	Why can't it just be about the flying?
4511000	4512000	Eh, whatever
4512000	4513000	Anyways
4513000	4520000	So when you think about high end computer systems, you probably don't think of Commodore
4520000	4522000	But they're hoping to change that
4522000	4525000	Because now they are back and they are trying to make a name for themselves
4525000	4528000	If the year was 1984, I would be thinking about Commodore
4528000	4532000	Because the Commodore 64 was my first gaming platform, really truly
4532000	4535000	Commodore 64 is an amazing piece of machinery
4535000	4536000	Amen
4536000	4539000	So yeah, now they're launching a new Commodore PC
4539000	4544000	Geared for PC gaming, and it's supposed to launch at Germany's SeeBit show
4544000	4547000	Actually this week, March 15th
4547000	4551000	I don't know
4551000	4554000	They're basically saying that's going to provide what gamers need and want
4554000	4556000	Excellent
4556000	4559000	Can I play Last Ninja on it, yes or no?
4559000	4561000	Better
4561000	4567000	Because if not, there's going to be one hell of a syntax error coming out of this angry gamer
4567000	4570000	That was a Commodore joke
4570000	4571000	Don't laugh at once
4571000	4573000	Yeah, that's why no one got it
4573000	4575000	That's why we're on the internet, boys and girls
4575000	4577000	Not satellite radio or the real deal
4577000	4579000	Maybe we should call ourselves Video Obscura
4579000	4580000	That'd be an awesome name
4580000	4582000	That's actually not a bad name for a podcast
4582000	4585000	At least Video Game Obscura
4585000	4588000	At least people would know we're a video game podcast as opposed to when people go
4588000	4590000	What the hell is Orange Lounge Radio?
4590000	4592000	Are you guys a lounge music podcast?
4592000	4596000	Yeah, we just had Richard Cheeze on last week
4596000	4599000	Speaking of cheese
4599000	4606000	There is a Lego MMO that is in development coming in 2008
4606000	4610000	It's being developed by NetDevil for auto assault
4610000	4616000	You go around building stuff and talking with people
4616000	4619000	It's just an MMO with Legos
4619000	4623000	It's for kids, but I love Legos so I'm probably going to play it
4623000	4625000	I love Legos too
4625000	4628000	I remember when you tried to make the charging cradle out of Legos
4628000	4629000	I did make a charging cradle
4629000	4631000	Speaking of which, I broke the charging cradle this week
4631000	4634000	Because Nelly wanted to play Elite Beat Agents
4634000	4635000	Because she's been playing that game now
4635000	4639000	I had to rip the cable out because it doesn't work very well plugged into the
4639000	4642000	For those that didn't hear the shows a while back
4642000	4646000	Loki actually built a DS charger out of Legos
4646000	4650000	So it was like a docking bay
4650000	4652000	He built one out of Legos
4652000	4655000	I like Legos too
4655000	4657000	Actual Legos
4657000	4660000	Not so much all these games
4660000	4663000	I measure my Legos in gallons now
4663000	4666000	And I still have 10 gallons of Legos in my closet
4666000	4669000	Let's build the next OLR studio out of Legos
4669000	4670000	We don't have enough Legos for that
4670000	4672000	I did one time build something
4672000	4676000	I used to have this desk that stretched one whole wall on my room
4676000	4683000	And I used every single Lego to build one giant, like, base thing or something
4683000	4686000	It's just like a really cool, like, I don't know
4686000	4687000	You remember Classic Gaming Expo though
4687000	4691000	Where they built the Space Invaders thing out of Legos
4691000	4693000	Hey, is Classic Gaming Expo coming back this year?
4693000	4694000	I heard they were going to be in Vegas this year
4694000	4695000	They're supposed to do, I think, the 10th anniversary
4695000	4697000	I want to go, I want to go, Jamie, let's go
4697000	4698000	But I'm going to something else
4698000	4700000	I'm going to Pinagogo
4700000	4703000	I heard a rumor you were going to
4703000	4705000	I don't know if I can say it on air, but
4705000	4708000	Yes, I'm planning on, if I can at all manage it
4708000	4710000	I'm going to be going to Dragon Con
4710000	4711000	Okay, she said I didn't
4711000	4714000	I want to go to be there at the podcasters panel
4714000	4716000	Just, you know, right now it's like
4716000	4717000	How am I going to afford that?
4717000	4718000	But, you know, I'm working on it
4718000	4720000	I played Monopoly Pinball
4720000	4724000	And I was actually kicking ass over at Sunnyvale Golf Land yesterday
4724000	4727000	What the fuck does that have to do with anything Dragon Con?
4727000	4728000	She mentioned pinball
4728000	4730000	Pinagogo
4730000	4732000	It's going to be a hard time
4732000	4734000	I don't know if I told, you know, everybody
4734000	4736000	But we did get a new machine
4736000	4738000	And we got a bride of pin-bot
4738000	4741000	And we are actually
4741000	4743000	Dan has my Rocky and Bullwinkle working now
4743000	4746000	Which makes me intensely happy
4746000	4748000	And our Guns N' Roses is now for sale
4748000	4749000	Aww
4749000	4751000	Will you sell it to someone on the internets?
4751000	4753000	Oh, but shipping would be an arm and a leg
4753000	4754000	If they live in the area
4754000	4755000	Or want to come pick it up
4755000	4756000	And pay us a lot of money for it
4756000	4757000	Then I don't think we have a lot
4757000	4758000	Define a lot
4758000	4759000	How much are you selling the Guns N' Roses for?
4759000	4761000	I don't know, it's up to Dan
4761000	4763000	He actually may have a trade worked out on it
4763000	4765000	But I think we are also selling our Johnny Mnemonic
4765000	4767000	It's a good pin, but I hate Johnny Mnemonic
4767000	4769000	You should let us know some prices
4769000	4771000	Well, I'll talk to the hubby and see
4771000	4773000	If he wants me to use our independent
4773000	4775000	Non-corporate sponsored podcast
4775000	4777000	To sell my pinball machine
4777000	4779000	Why not? You got to get something out of this deal
4779000	4780000	Seriously
4780000	4781000	Alright, well something else you can do
4781000	4782000	If you love Orange Launch Radio
4782000	4783000	We'll give some cheap plugs
4783000	4785000	For some of our other stuff right now
4785000	4787000	You can always leave us a review on iTunes
4787000	4789000	Because we could definitely use some more 5 star review on iTunes
4789000	4791000	Because it helps spread the word about the program
4791000	4793000	Also, you can visit our MySpace
4793000	4795000	www.myspace.com
4795000	4797000	Slash Orange Launch Radio
4797000	4799000	And be our friend on there
4799000	4801000	Because who doesn't love having a thousand friends on MySpace
4801000	4803000	And being attention whores over there
4803000	4805000	Also, we are now
4805000	4807000	Participating in the new All Games Community site
4807000	4808000	Over at community.allgames.com
4808000	4809000	Most of us are so far
4809000	4811000	You will be as of tonight
4811000	4813000	We will all have profiles on that site
4813000	4815000	And I'm actually using my blog over there
4815000	4816000	It's kind of fun
4816000	4818000	And I've been doing official
4818000	4820000	Well, not, I don't know, official
4820000	4822000	Whatever, but Orange Launch
4822000	4824000	Video game review haikus
4824000	4827000	Where I review games in haiku form
4827000	4829000	So if you want to see what the hell that's all about
4829000	4831000	You gotta go find my page on
4831000	4833000	The Community All Games site
4833000	4835000	Because I review video games in haiku form
4835000	4837000	575
4837000	4839000	Anything else we should plug
4839000	4841000	Before we take a break
4841000	4843000	I don't know
4843000	4844000	I can't think of anything
4844000	4845000	This is kind of a short show tonight
4845000	4846000	I have a weird story
4846000	4847000	But it's not gaming
4847000	4848000	Well, it's
4848000	4849000	No, it's not gaming really
4849000	4850000	There's some weird reason
4850000	4851000	Like, this is weird
4851000	4852000	Usually our shows have been running
4852000	4853000	Almost to the two hour mark
4853000	4854000	We haven't even hit 90 minutes
4854000	4855000	For part A this week
4855000	4856000	Why not?
4856000	4857000	A short story from Loki
4857000	4858000	Okay, this is kind of weird
4858000	4860000	I was watching Comedy Central today
4860000	4863000	And Spike TV absorbed Comedy Central
4863000	4866000	Like, at least on my Comcast box
4866000	4868000	So two channels were Spike TV
4868000	4870000	Which were playing some really crappy
4870000	4873000	Pros versus Joes
4873000	4874000	Or something like that
4874000	4875000	Thing, which is
4875000	4878000	I don't have any interest in sports TV
4878000	4879000	But it was funny though
4879000	4880000	Because all of a sudden
4880000	4882000	It was like Spike TV
4882000	4884000	Also last night I was watching G4 TV
4884000	4886000	Because they had cheaters on
4886000	4887000	And that was kind of funny
4887000	4888000	What else are you going to watch
4888000	4890000	Like, you know, at midnight
4890000	4891000	I don't know
4891000	4893000	I guess I could have watched Saturday Night Live
4893000	4894000	But that's not funny
4894000	4895000	So
4895000	4896000	Actually, hey
4896000	4897000	But Saturday Night Live did bring us
4897000	4898000	Laser Cats this season
4898000	4899000	It is getting better again
4899000	4900000	It's not
4900000	4901000	It ain't
4901000	4902000	It ain't
4902000	4903000	It's Dana Carvey
4903000	4904000	Chris Farley
4904000	4905000	Or, you know
4905000	4906000	Especially not
4906000	4907000	It's Gilda Radner
4907000	4908000	Or Dan Aykroyd
4908000	4909000	Days
4909000	4910000	But
4910000	4911000	It is still pretty
4911000	4912000	It's getting better
4912000	4913000	Than it was last year
4913000	4915000	Of course, usually I try to go out
4915000	4916000	On Saturday nights
4916000	4917000	So I don't know
4917000	4918000	I don't get to watch it at home a lot
4918000	4919000	But I do see, like, the YouTubage and things
4919000	4921000	Come on, what did this year bring us?
4921000	4922000	This year brought us Laser Cats
4922000	4923000	It brought us Dick in a Box
4923000	4925000	Some good stuff
4925000	4926000	Good stuff
4926000	4927000	I actually
4927000	4928000	I actually
4928000	4929000	When I went to New York in October
4929000	4930000	I got to see the set
4930000	4931000	That was kind of fun
4931000	4932000	In a touristy way
4932000	4933000	So, hey
4933000	4934000	Any other
4934000	4935000	Do you have any short stories
4935000	4936000	You'd like to share with our listeners
4936000	4937000	Um
4937000	4939000	I'm starting a
4939000	4941000	A fund that's called the
4941000	4944000	Send Dark Sakura to Dragon Con Fund
4944000	4946000	Either that or buy me a Dolphie
4946000	4949000	Why don't you massage your way to Dragon Con?
4949000	4950000	You know, I would
4950000	4952000	But I have to take a whole lot more massage classes before then
4952000	4953000	Oh, that sucks
4953000	4954000	But, um
4954000	4955000	I'm actually
4955000	4956000	You know what
4956000	4957000	Two weeks to go, Rob
4957000	4959000	No, three weeks, sorry
4959000	4960000	Three weeks to go
4960000	4963000	I will be a fully certified massage therapist
4963000	4965000	And then I can charge everybody
4965000	4966000	Cool
4966000	4968000	I guess
4968000	4969000	Well, I mean
4969000	4970000	Massage is good for your health
4970000	4971000	Maybe they need
4971000	4972000	You know
4972000	4973000	Conventions are a lot of walking
4973000	4974000	You should massage people's feet
4974000	4975000	I'm actually thinking about
4975000	4976000	Um
4976000	4977000	Cause my friend
4977000	4978000	A lot of my friends are on the
4978000	4979000	Fanime staff
4979000	4981000	I'm actually thinking about asking them if I can
4981000	4982000	Get an event license
4982000	4984000	God, Fanime's right around the corner too
4984000	4985000	May, end of May
4985000	4986000	Yeah
4986000	4987000	But I'm seeing if
4987000	4988000	I'm gonna see if I can
4988000	4990000	Get like an event license from
4990000	4992000	Wherever I have to in San Jose
4992000	4994000	And set up a
4994000	4995000	Set up a
4995000	4996000	Massage at
4996000	4997000	Fanime
4997000	4998000	There you go
4998000	4999000	Fun
4999000	5000000	I don't have a chair yet
5000000	5001000	But I can rent a chair
5001000	5002000	Alright
5002000	5003000	So for the weary
5003000	5004000	Fanime con-goer
5004000	5005000	Do you know how often
5005000	5006000	I've been in
5006000	5007000	Fucking costume
5007000	5009000	And wish someone would rub my feet
5009000	5010000	Cause I was in
5010000	5011000	Freaking
5011000	5012000	Five inch
5012000	5013000	Platform heels
5013000	5014000	Oh my god
5014000	5015000	My Mad Hatter costume
5015000	5018000	I've worn many an uncomfortable costume
5018000	5020000	But my Mad Hatter costume was the worst
5020000	5021000	Because of the wings on my back
5021000	5023000	And the fucking heels
5023000	5024000	So
5024000	5025000	I think massage therapy
5025000	5026000	At
5026000	5027000	Anime conventions
5027000	5028000	Is brilliant
5028000	5029000	Alright well we'll see what happens
5029000	5030000	Holler if you hear me
5030000	5031000	Alright
5031000	5032000	Holla
5032000	5033000	Alright
5033000	5034000	We better go ahead and take a break
5034000	5035000	So we'll be back
5035000	5036000	After this short break
