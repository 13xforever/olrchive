14332	25429	Tonight, March 11, 2007, has Sony won back some fans with the unveiling of PlayStation Home, the Anharmonix Forge deal, and has an online poll foreseeing the return of Knights?
32000	36003	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36043	41067	We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gamer culture and gamer lifestyle.
41448	46071	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46592	46892	Hi.
47432	48113	How are you doing?
48453	49194	I have salad.
49394	50755	You have a salad, a yummy salad?
51015	51916	I has a salad.
52485	54306	I has Fresh Choice earlier today.
54326	54766	It was good.
55026	55987	It has Quiznos.
56287	59048	Do they have Fresh Choice all throughout the country?
59088	59428	I don't know.
59448	60108	Is that a local thing?
61009	62849	Basically, it's an entire restaurant that's a giant salad bar.
62869	65190	The only way you get salad bars is if you go to Shoney's.
65230	65951	Or Sizzlers.
66251	67631	We don't have Sizzlers in Alabama.
67671	69372	I know what Shoney's is, but they don't have that here.
69692	70652	Shoney's is nasty.
71933	73734	Well, so is Waffle House, yet it's still popular.
73754	74934	Waffle House is not nasty.
75594	77995	Waffle House has special drugs that they put in the hash browns.
78936	81697	Anyway, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
82449	85330	A whole place dedicated to salads, nasty.
86331	86931	What the fuck?
86951	89792	It's a pita's dream, I mean, seriously.
90052	91393	Or pita's dream, yeah.
91493	92753	They have pizza and soup, too.
93914	96555	Okay, well, soup is okay.
97075	98315	Why the fuck is pizza there?
98335	99276	That's just so random.
99976	101617	I guess it's healthy pizza, I don't know.
101997	107019	Well, I remember... God, I went there a long-ass time ago with an ex, and...
108120	109020	I had pasta there.
109040	112462	Pasta was okay, but salad is just nasty.
112622	114743	That's what food eats.
115743	116584	I don't eat that.
116764	117524	I eat food.
118665	118965	All right.
119545	123307	Well, let's get into tonight's program.
124027	130510	First off, actually, I want to say, Techmaster Loki, did you notice we did not get the FUs of the Week music automatically start playing?
130590	133611	I was a good boy this week and made that not play.
133631	134552	That's because he told you to.
134992	135192	What?
136673	136913	No.
136933	136973	No?
137651	139072	I thought of it all by myself.
141313	143654	Stupid Jamie revealing stupid behind-the-scenes stuff.
144034	144554	All right, anyhow.
144954	148196	Also, I do want to plug the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
148536	156500	We have lots of boys and girls that come there to chat with us, kind of the fourth guest of our program when we don't have any other regular fourth guests such as tonight.
156560	157900	We don't really have a regular fourth guest.
157920	158621	That kind of sucks.
158861	159781	I tried to get Dan to come.
160281	160682	Oh, really?
161102	162642	Why didn't you know I was going to come?
162662	163703	And his loud friends.
163843	165244	Probably for the best they didn't come then.
165504	165824	Yeah.
166861	169563	They're playing some car game.
169623	170504	When's Marissa coming back?
171244	171805	Maybe next week.
172425	172746	Sweet.
172906	173466	How about Chris?
173946	176388	Maybe next week.
176548	181612	Because I'm horribly broke, I have to have Chris and Marissa come up here for doing the birthday stuff.
182193	186656	I think that might be when Rice Princess and Eddie come here too, so we could get everybody in here in one week.
186676	187516	You know what?
187537	188357	We could just all leave.
188817	189338	Honestly.
189658	190919	Three of us could just take the night off.
190979	191680	Let them do the show.
191700	192540	What do you say, chat room?
193461	195222	Let Chris, Rice Princess...
196969	200152	and Marissa and Eddie do the show instead of us.
200172	200592	Okay.
200612	201112	What do you say?
201733	202453	We'll take the night off.
202513	203694	We'll go out to eat.
204075	204635	Let's do that.
204755	205696	We'll go to Country Waffles.
205716	206897	We'll go to Fresh Toys.
206997	208658	Our knockoff of Waffle House we have out here.
208678	209399	We'll go to Fresh Toys.
209459	209739	All right.
210239	211120	They close at four.
212741	214963	The entire chat room's at no, no, no.
216124	218285	And they're only open breakfast and lunch.
218365	218806	Oh, damn it.
219326	219566	All right.
220247	221648	Oh, we got a hell yeah from Zappy.
221768	222188	There you go.
222268	223609	DDR dollar bill, hell fucking yes.
223850	225671	They don't love us anymore is what it boils down to.
226445	226905	That's sad.
227826	231287	Alright, well, let's start off tonight's program the way we usually start it off with.
231327	236350	A little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week, where we talk about the games we've been playing this week, if anything at all.
236410	237090	DarkSakura.
237370	238571	Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
239191	239691	Still, huh?
240091	243773	Yes, and then Dan had to take it back, so he's just going to buy it for me after payday.
244353	247575	The only freaking PS3 game I will play, like, regularly.
248716	249956	I love my PlayStation 3 now.
250136	251697	It gives me Captain America and Wolverine.
252389	253330	In the same game.
253350	255832	Although the damn thing is on the Wii and the 360 as well.
256353	256873	I don't care.
256893	259776	360 achievement points.
260056	260436	That's true.
260677	263499	The Wii could do flippy floppy movie things.
263539	263819	You know what?
263859	264940	I don't like doing that.
266181	268083	I do not like doing that.
268103	274589	I have to say, as much as I love the Wii, I think that when you have games that are made for play like that, that's one thing.
274609	277732	But when you have a fucking platformer, just fucking put a controller in my hand and let me play.
278737	279318	Exterminate!
300942	305204	Goddammit, Tigerclaw, why do you have to drive the knife in my heart?
306085	312068	I'm assuming, I haven't even looked at chat, I'm assuming Tigerclaw's talking about how your Wednesday must have been.
312448	313189	How did your Wednesday go?
313209	314389	I hate you, Marvel!
315930	316790	Bitches!
317531	327016	In case, for whatever reason, this is your first week listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you know, sometimes we talk about our personal lives as well, and one thing that DarkSakura is also a fangirl of is comics, namely Captain America...
327560	336286	And which is funny because really on this program, I know you've liked Captain America a long time, but it really seems like, especially in the past six weeks, your fandom seems to have rekindled.
336366	340269	Because I started reading all the Civil War comics and I was like, dude, he's cool.
340389	347715	Okay, but then, so it was kind of funny that, I mean, not like funny haha, but funny like, don't call Jamie today.
347815	351137	Like when I saw it in the news that they'd killed off Captain America.
351217	354139	So how was your day when that happened?
354400	355020	He will be back.
355660	356380	You think he'll be back?
356560	357240	Oh, come on.
357260	362442	It's a fucking, you know, Marvel needs money, so they do gimmicky things.
362502	368424	So I was looking at your All Games community page today, and somebody decided to jab the knife through your heart a little more.
368464	372645	Basically, somebody put a comment on Jamie's page and said, like, ha-ha, Captain America died.
372925	375586	What do you say to those people that say, ha-ha, Captain America died?
377206	377827	Died of fire.
378467	379207	That's what I thought.
379827	381808	Is there anything else in your week you want to talk about?
382448	382528	Um...
384266	385287	I really like my salad.
385407	385907	It's tasty.
413624	414765	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
438257	467110	I didn't realize that there were actually stages in the game so it's kind of neat they get to become different things including like a dolphin looking thing so that's kind of neat and then I played Motorstorm which Motorstorm is pretty awesome graphically and it's pretty fun to play my only gripe on it split screen multiplayer for one that would have been nice the other thing is you know the game looks so awesome and there's like some pretty cool animation in the little menus and stuff
467679	472001	But during races, the fucking spectators are cardboard cutouts.
472701	476543	And they're not even animated cardboard cutouts, they're just like stuck in a pose.
477364	486708	And I'm like, I understand that, you know, you probably couldn't animate all these people in the game, even though other games can do that, you know.
488029	490670	That's how I was in the Gran Turismo HD concept at E3, right?
490770	492371	Oh yeah, and I still thought I was retarded there.
494992	496893	Granted, they're probably trying to save on, you know...
497714	499795	Calculations and stuff to make it run smoother.
499835	503456	But the least you could do is make them animate a little bit.
503596	508418	So I can kind of go, okay, at least that doesn't look as hokey.
508639	512380	It's 2D, but at least it's animating or doing something, cheering and stuff.
512680	516222	When I see just a person standing there frozen, it just looks retarded.
516242	520023	That's something you would do on the fucking Super Nintendo or something.
520083	524245	And even the fucking Super Nintendo had animated sprites that were cheering in the background.
524825	526706	Yeah, but those little dudes aren't sprites anymore.
527498	529624	Sprites are so last gen.
530105	533775	Okay, well, it's still something that's sitting there in 3D spaces 2D, okay?
534217	534517	Whatever.
535805	537066	So they could have done that.
537406	539127	That's my big gripe on that.
539227	540188	Otherwise, the game's fun.
540668	541648	I had a lot of fun playing it.
541728	548052	Speaking of last gen, AlphaCanongram in chat says, Loki, split-screen multiplayer is so last gen.
548312	549873	Oh, yeah, it's so last gen.
549893	552735	That's why Halo 3 is going to fucking have split-screen multiplayer.
552755	555857	That's why Call of Duty 3 has split-screen multiplayer.
555897	558258	That's why Gears of War has split-screen multiplayer.
558718	560199	So fuck off.
560259	561600	It's still in town, okay?
563496	568719	No, last gen, it's because you can't fucking program a game that can have multiple instances of it running at the same time.
568959	571520	So, that's just lazy programming.
572500	575082	Which, you know, I'm sure MotorStorm wasn't lazy programming.
575102	581285	It wasn't like they downgraded from 1080p and 60 frames per second to 720p and 30 frames per second.
582005	583846	Which, I still say, though, the game looks fun.
584806	585727	And it looks pretty awesome.
586967	592710	Some other things that they probably didn't think about, though, when you're playing in first person, like, say, in the cockpit type thing,
593613	598194	Um, and it's not really in the cockpit, the camera's just on the front of the vehicle, which is still stupid.
598614	606837	But, if you happen to crash into something and your hood gets bent, you could actually not be able to drive in that perspective because it's blocking the whole camera.
607317	608597	Which, totally makes sense.
609958	610658	But, uh, anyways.
611138	614459	So, other than PlayStation 3 stuff, um, let's see here.
615159	619280	On the PSP, I was playing, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, which is fun.
619520	622081	I also put some homebrew stuff on there, including...
623065	631753	This game called No Gravity, which I might say this game right here, they could totally sell at retail and it looks a lot better than most of the PSP games out there.
632133	638879	And so the fact that most of those games out there for the PSP are getting their asses kicked by a homebrew game, that's pretty sad.
639500	647947	That's pretty sad that a demo for a game looks way better than a lot of the stuff at Konami, Capcom, whatever put out on the PSP.
648027	649889	So it can be done.
650993	653034	I just would like to see some more independent games come out there.
653054	657976	Maybe something like XNA or something like that for the PSP would be pretty awesome.
659777	660817	But that's about it.
661297	665519	I'm about to load the Thrill Kill and DDR5th Mix on my PSP during the show.
666600	668060	Well, keep us posted on that.
668280	670421	So you're not actually going to be participating in tonight's show?
670441	671101	Oh, no, I will be.
671442	671662	Okay.
672062	672742	Do that in between.
672822	673202	All right.
673402	674903	That's fine.
675223	678324	HitStun wants to know, does the retail MotorStorm crash every five minutes?
678725	678905	Nope.
679425	679485	No.
680148	684809	My Gaming Week Surprisingly enough, I actually played a little bit of Crackdown this week Which is usually not the type of game I would get into, but
702369	703329	Crackdown's kind of fun.
703509	707371	It's like Grand Theft Auto, only there's no hookers to have sex with.
707891	711052	And you jump really, really high and flying all over the place and all that stuff.
711132	712732	But I find there's a lot to discover.
713053	715233	I kind of like just walking around doing random stuff.
715593	719154	Like, you know, I don't really like having to fight the gangs and get into that whole thing.
719215	723196	No, I like to jump around the Ferris wheel and do the little race around the Ferris wheel.
723216	724036	That stuff's fun.
724436	726517	And finding the orbs and all that stupid crap.
726557	726677	So,
727259	728480	Good times with Crackdown.
728940	734042	A couple people tried to challenge me in co-op or whatever, or I guess you don't really challenge someone in co-op.
734262	737504	They wanted to play co-op with me, and I declined, because I suck at Crackdown.
737784	741726	But this week, I'll probably actually play, because I was still trying to learn Crackdown.
741766	744847	I don't want someone to come into a game with me, and I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.
744867	745747	Did I just shoot you?
745887	748068	Oh, shit, I just blew you up with a rocket launcher.
748509	748889	I don't know.
749489	751290	I kind of want to have a little skill before.
751310	753611	Because sometimes I feel weird playing listeners.
753671	755932	I have a lot on the Xbox Friends list.
756426	760710	I think the listeners sometimes expect us to actually be good at games because we talk about them.
762392	763513	They really don't know about you.
763773	764734	Oh, hi, Rice Princess.
764754	765414	You came out of nowhere.
765514	765975	Oh, sorry.
765995	766535	What'd you say?
766555	768697	You said they really don't know much about you, then.
768837	769258	No, they don't.
769478	769838	Ha ha.
769938	770319	That's fine.
770619	772060	That was a jab at you.
772741	775023	Jeremy Tau once said, Rob didn't want to play co-op with me.
775063	776664	He denied me when I asked to join his game.
777065	782810	Actually, that may not have been me because the other thing you have to keep in mind is that Shane has been playing my game without asking, by the way.
783857	784797	You're having a fluffer takeover.
812071	812712	What, Loki?
812832	815634	So you're having an e-penis fluffer takeover.
815854	817455	Yes, Shane is fluffing my e-penis.
817495	818756	Maybe right now as we speak.
818816	820277	Don't make a face, Rice Princess.
821477	823739	Rice Princess, how was your gaming week, if you have anything to share?
825100	825941	Hey, guess what?
826261	827301	I was playing WoW.
827422	827782	Did you?
827822	829003	Wow, you played WoW.
829083	831404	Wow, that's the same as every other week.
831464	833646	I play a lot of World of Warcraft as well, actually.
833906	834386	I know.
835307	836668	Almost every time I come on, I see you.
837468	838329	I made a troll.
838929	839630	You're a troll.
840515	841677	DarkSakura.com
858482	859903	with all your gear.
860163	861184	It's 29, get it right.
861264	862004	Oh, it's 29 now.
862225	869369	Because you told me when I went and played on your server once, it was like, you go to 19 and then you stop and you play nothing but Warsong Gulch for the rest of your life.
869590	875354	Yeah, that's what I did originally, but then I discovered the world of 29 and I was like, wow, you get poisons as a rogue.
875514	878496	And you get Arathi Basin, which I think is an awesome PvP.
878536	880697	Exactly.
881198	884380	Because Warsong Gulch is so last gen.
884940	885821	Oh my god, yeah.
885941	887122	Like, who does that anymore?
887142	887202	God.
888419	889399	All that Isla Storm.
889419	889880	I'm just kidding.
919138	924081	Okay, twinks are like the young, hot boys, right?
924201	930625	Like the good-looking ones that... Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but sure, I guess I get what you're getting at.
930665	932567	Like magazine-looking guys.
932587	935568	Why don't you elaborate on what exactly a gay twink is?
937029	944374	I don't know if all the listeners want to... It's basically a person who... I would think a guy who kind of looks underage who isn't.
944594	947656	Like your blonde hair, blue-eyed, that whole thing.
948504	948804	Okay.
948884	951565	Completely waxed everywhere type look.
952685	955546	So, like, the best looking, like, no?
956127	957707	I think it's kind of an unnatural look.
957727	959608	It has to do with, like, an age thing?
959628	961408	Do we really have to keep going with this topic?
961428	965130	Well, because then it's going to, like, maybe my perception of what a twink is is different.
965250	966570	Okay, you know good enough.
966690	972092	Okay, I thought it was, like, you know, it had something to do with, like, old men liking twinks.
972628	975629	So they would, like, be their sugar daddies and give them a lot of money and stuff.
975649	976109	Maybe, I don't know.
976289	980049	And I'm thinking, like, okay, well, to be a twink, you have to have a lot of money to pay for your stuff.
980469	986711	So maybe twinking is, like, whoring yourself out to, like, get money to get all these awesome enchants and stuff.
987351	988591	I mean, but that's just a theory.
988931	989671	I don't really know.
990211	992172	I just heard a bunch of people say, oh, twink, twink, twink.
992192	993252	And I was like, okay, sure.
994112	995092	That's exactly what I am.
996132	997533	If by twink you mean awesome.
998393	998873	All right.
999841	1003304	I'm trying to see if there's anything in the chat room here that says what's going on.
1003564	1006266	JV Mon says, welcome to gay slang chat on OLR.
1006366	1007647	There you have it.
1007667	1008067	Let's see.
1009028	1018474	Squeenix says, in the gay slang, twink is a term that describes a young or young-looking male usually of slender build with little to no body hair.
1018854	1020776	Often they are described as blonde hair and blue eyed.
1020816	1025859	To many gay men, the term is pejorative and implies shallowness and stupidity.
1026160	1029462	Twinks are typically contrasted with bears, and that's from Wikipedia.
1030046	1030546	So there you have it.
1030566	1034248	But that doesn't say anything about how the hell, then, did they get the name in World of Warcraft?
1035129	1035749	You know what?
1036129	1037010	I have no idea.
1037190	1039531	I didn't realize there were so many gay players in WoW, right?
1039551	1041252	That they would come up with a different name.
1041272	1041992	All right, I'm done.
1042052	1042913	I'm done with this topic.
1043013	1044073	Yeah, we're done with that.
1044593	1045194	I'm done with that.
1045254	1046394	Let's talk about other news.
1046555	1047275	You do that.
1047315	1049376	But I only stopped by to say hi, so I'm going to leave now.
1050036	1050537	Bye, get out.
1050577	1051357	Bye, listeners.
1051377	1052117	We don't like you anyway.
1052458	1052678	Fine.
1052718	1053038	Get out.
1053558	1054339	I wish everyone hates me.
1055990	1063752	Yes, well, most of the podcasts you're listening to this week are probably going to be talking a lot about their experiences at Game Developers Conference.
1064072	1065413	But not us, we didn't go.
1066513	1066793	Nope.
1067173	1072235	That's right, we sat home on our big butts and read about it on the internet, just like most of you guys out there did at home.
1072995	1077556	I was originally going to go to Game Developers Conference, but some things came up and I didn't end up going.
1078957	1080177	But we did get to...
1081033	1087294	Go to San Francisco yesterday to meet some people that we, you know, because if I had gone to Game Developers Conference, it would have been like a networking thing.
1087714	1090095	Like, I would have gotten to meet a lot of people and all that stuff.
1091315	1095616	So what we did is we drove to San Francisco because some of our buddies over at All Games were in town.
1095656	1098656	And, of course, we rebroadcast our program over on All Games on Monday nights.
1099036	1101777	So we went over and met with some of the All Games folks.
1101837	1106098	We met with Bobby and we met with Lawrence, although Lawrence we were basically taking to the airport.
1106118	1107238	So we didn't get to spend a lot of time with him.
1107997	1124787	Bobby, who does the other Sunday Night Show you might listen to over on All Games, we spent some time with him when we went to Sunnyvale Golf Land, which is a pretty big arcade, kind of infamous in Northern California for the many fighting game tournaments it's had and DDR music game tournaments it's had.
1125547	1133372	Kind of sad to go in there and see the place as basically turned into the entire middle where they used to have tons of classic games.
1133891	1138714	Like, you know, they had like the old school fighting games and stuff were all up in the middle section.
1139114	1140935	All gone, and it's all ticket spitters now.
1142215	1143116	Which kind of made me sad.
1143156	1143476	I don't know.
1143516	1154302	I made this big long rant over at my all games blog over at community.allgames.com about how kind of sad it is just to see that the arcades are kind of
1154921	1156682	Really giving way to the ticket spitters.
1156982	1168506	And although Sunnyvale Golf Line did have some pretty cool music games, they had, you know, Beatmania 2DX Happy Sky, which I got to play, and they had Poppin' Music 8, which was cool, and they had some nice racing games.
1168526	1171268	They had, like, everything in the little niche genres they had.
1171708	1176089	I don't know, it was kind of sad to see that most of the arcade has turned into that whole gambling for kids thing.
1176410	1179691	So it kind of got me thinking, what do you think it would take...
1180211	1182032	for us to really go back to arcades now?
1182072	1190355	Because, you know, a lot of folks say that arcades are dying because you can get the same experience at home and you can get a lot of them on Xbox Live.
1190415	1193116	What do arcades need to do business again?
1194356	1202919	New games and well-maintained games and just something... Because even still, you can play DDR at home, but it's not the same as playing in the arcade.
1203339	1206300	And, you know, just you need the atmosphere back.
1206420	1207281	It's pretty much it.
1207321	1207801	You need to...
1208635	1209255	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1239232	1239872	Dave and Busters.
1241853	1244193	Dave and Busters is kind of like that for adults.
1244393	1246994	I mean, do you really play a lot of the arcade games, Dave and Busters?
1247014	1251635	Maybe a few, but a lot of us kind of succumb to the whole ticket spitting thing at Dave and Busters because we're drunk.
1253375	1253635	Right?
1253835	1258696	No, I usually go off and, you know, when they had the, what was the, Mecha Assault?
1259156	1265137	When they had that there, I know that that was always what, you know, whenever I'd go with Dan and the guys, that's what they went right for.
1265637	1267538	And I'd always play my Deluxe games, you know.
1267558	1268478	But they got rid of Mecha Assault.
1269056	1269977	Stupid fuckers.
1270838	1274323	I'm not really angry at the ticket spitters necessarily.
1274363	1282052	It's disappointing to see, but if that's where the money is, I mean, it's not like I'm totally mad at Golfman because if that's where the money is, that's what they're going to buy, right?
1282172	1286017	I mean, granted, those ticket spitters probably make them a ton of money, but...
1287234	1291657	I try to think about what's really been new in the arcade lately that I've had to get excited about.
1292038	1293259	DDR Supernova?
1293619	1299904	Well, I'm sorry, Bomani fans, but DDR Supernova was pretty much just a DDR 9th mix.
1299944	1302746	It didn't bring a whole lot of new stuff to the table, really.
1303067	1304988	It was just kind of the same game all over again.
1306590	1310093	And even you could say the games like In the Groove and stuff that tried to fill in the gaps, same thing.
1310113	1311614	It was four panel dancing.
1311634	1312875	It was the same damn game you always knew.
1313379	1315859	But even DDR alone was not going to save an arcade.
1315959	1316460	You know what I mean?
1316800	1319000	There hasn't been a lot of new stuff in general.
1319440	1325181	I mean, the last big new arcade release I can think of was Soul Calibur 3, but that was already on the home consoles.
1325981	1326941	So, I don't know.
1326961	1330382	It seems like they're really starting to just kind of go away from making arcade games.
1330422	1331142	It's kind of sad.
1331442	1335103	Because if it weren't for that arcade community, this show would not exist.
1335803	1336143	Period.
1336823	1337943	We need more Planet Harrier.
1339043	1340944	I don't know if that's going to save it.
1341024	1341384	We'll see.
1342544	1342784	All right.
1343586	1344986	Let's see, I'm trying to go to the chat room.
1345466	1351928	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com See, I had all games on the brain because of our little discussion with Bobby.
1351968	1352888	Don't go to that chat room.
1352908	1353488	That's the wrong one.
1353848	1356669	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com And let's see.
1357749	1359469	I'm trying to see what kind of chat's going on here.
1359889	1364110	Fireboma says the arcade by me is just having games that are more like rides now.
1364430	1365671	Some of those can be okay though.
1365931	1370892	Like remember After Burner with the freaking thing that you would sit in that would practically make you sick?
1370952	1371692	That was great.
1374874	1375155	Let's see.
1375535	1377835	NM64 says, Arcade Halo.
1378175	1379556	Sadly, that would probably bring him back.
1379836	1381636	You know, I kind of tend to agree.
1382056	1382577	Something like that.
1382597	1383177	Arcade Half-Life.
1383977	1384617	Do they have that?
1384797	1384997	Yeah.
1385237	1386278	Do you remember the grid?
1386398	1387218	I was kind of like that.
1387358	1389739	They have Half-Life in Japan where you can play that in the arcade.
1389799	1390099	Really?
1390119	1390619	Multiplayer.
1390779	1393199	I think about a game we saw at E3 a couple years ago.
1393219	1399961	I don't remember if it was 04 or 05, but Andamiro of all companies was showing off this arcade game that would actually interface with computer versions of the game.
1399981	1401082	It was like a first-person shooter.
1401182	1401802	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
1402362	1402502	Hmm.
1404476	1410641	OL Army recruit, I'm sorry, James Patrick says Virtua Fighter 5 should come to US arcades.
1412822	1413543	That'd be interesting.
1414524	1423390	Alright, so I don't know if there's an easy answer to how arcades can be kind of fun again for all of us, not just, you know, kids 8 through 12 or whatever.
1424231	1425091	We welcome your feedback.
1425131	1432376	Mail back at orangelaunchradio.com or you can head over to my blog, bloggy blog over at the community.allgames site and leave a comment.
1432497	1433057	That would be awesome.
1434128	1437751	and I just want to say thanks to Bobby for hanging out with us yesterday and you should check out his show.
1438151	1444536	He's on AllGames.com at 5 o'clock Pacific Time, about an hour before we go live over here at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1444556	1445717	He also does a podcast.
1446497	1450740	It's a different show over there because it's just him and his chat room and his callers.
1451241	1454763	So it's, you know, the chat and the callers really drive that show.
1454823	1460868	But Bobby's a really good moderator and he actually moderated a panel at GDC that Loki and I listened to on the car ride home.
1460888	1461368	It was pretty good.
1461829	1462229	Good times.
1463327	1467350	And I forgot to mention, I played a lot of games over at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
1467370	1470192	Loki playing Poppin' Music was fucking hilarious.
1471012	1476036	I hate Poppin' Music, but I had like $10 in tokens and I needed to get rid of them.
1476856	1478477	And I was too tired to play DDR.
1478778	1480018	Yet I did play more of it.
1480999	1484822	So I played Poppin' 8, and I suck at Poppin' Music.
1486082	1488764	I'm not surprised, because I knew I sucked at Poppin' Music.
1488944	1490826	It's just I really sucked at Poppin' Music.
1491146	1492887	I played the Star Trek theme, and that sucked.
1493240	1496522	and I played some random song and that really sucked.
1497062	1500704	Then I played 2DX, Happy Sky, and I sucked at that and that was fun.
1501164	1506786	And I played Supernova and Supernova was pretty good until I picked a random double song that was like a kata or something.
1508187	1509148	I was too tired to play it.
1510028	1511029	I played part of it though.
1511329	1511769	It was fun.
1511949	1513890	I'm just getting too out of shape for this.
1514870	1515991	I'm out of practice.
1517479	1520721	Black Wolf is actually in chat right now and says Sky might have taken video on his phone.
1520741	1521282	I actually didn't.
1521302	1522282	I did take a picture though.
1522322	1525585	I'll put that on the community site later of Loki playing poppin' music.
1525645	1526365	Good times.
1526986	1527426	Good times.
1529607	1533030	James Patrick's continuing on the Virtua Fighter 5 thing.
1533210	1538313	That would be great knowing you could fight anyone in Japan or America who's using the Virtua Fighter 5 arcade.
1538333	1542075	Kind of going with that whole thing about maybe being able to interface with computers and stuff.
1542756	1543236	Pretty cool.
1544137	1544217	Uh...
1544938	1548681	Illusion says that Pachinko machines could revitalize arcades.
1549101	1550122	That's an interesting thought.
1552063	1554685	Alright, so anyway, we had fun at the arcade the other day.
1555125	1562491	But going back to Game Developers Conference and starting off tonight's news, I want to talk about, of course, huge news in the Sony department.
1562531	1567834	In fact, this news is like so big, we might actually want to take calls on this, just this, a little later.
1569476	1571697	Sony unveiled this week at the Game Developers Conference.
1571717	1572818	It's very interesting news.
1573360	1581465	And we'll talk about Nintendo's conference in Part B, but a lot of the stuff that you saw the big companies do was really about the game development.
1581725	1586448	They didn't turn Game Developers Conference into E3 like a lot of people thought, which is a good thing, I think.
1586488	1587869	Game developers need their hangout.
1588409	1589510	It was not E3.
1589850	1596935	But Sony kind of used their keynote to drop E3-like bombs at, but they're kind of in a position where they need to, right?
1596975	1598936	They're getting the bad press right now.
1599474	1603456	Everybody kind of gives them a buy to use Game Developers Conference as their platform.
1603896	1605897	And some would say they hit a home run.
1606718	1607238	I think so.
1608378	1609539	Key word there is home.
1609819	1611300	They revealed PlayStation Home.
1611540	1613101	Of course, we talked about it last week.
1613361	1620804	But even when we talked about it last week, and the whole Kotaku drama that resulted, I don't think I was expecting anything like this.
1621405	1622725	I don't think any of us were.
1623086	1625867	When I heard it was going to be like Animal Crossing, I'm picturing to myself...
1626466	1627987	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1650826	1653167	And you could look at your virtual trophy rack.
1653587	1659129	They've basically taken Microsoft's achievement system and kind of evolved it into, hey, you could get trophies that you put in your house.
1659149	1659970	Look at my stuff.
1660010	1661650	Yeah, come over and look at my stuff.
1661890	1662631	But not just that.
1663011	1664891	Let's say you want to put a TV in your apartment.
1665151	1668133	Then you can run videos on your TV from your PlayStation.
1668513	1671974	Put pictures up on the wall that you have on your PlayStation Drive.
1672334	1676496	Walk up to a pool table that you put down in your place and actually start playing pool.
1676536	1678316	They're going to have some games included with this.
1678817	1679857	All of it, free.
1680642	1690726	That's basically what they're saying is what Microsoft is giving you in Xbox Live, we are now going to give you this service called PlayStation Home, and it's free.
1691267	1708714	Of course, the money that they're going to make, advertising on all the billboards throughout the place, and people love to customize, so unless you want the raggy, cheap IKEA furniture in your apartment, if you want some of the nice bling couches and stuff, you're going to have to probably pay for those, and people will probably do it.
1709488	1711789	People will do that because they buy shit in Second Life.
1712189	1719350	All right, so this will all roll out in a closed beta of about 15,000 users between April and August.
1719730	1728232	The open beta, about 50,000 users, August through October, and the service will go live with everybody probably about October.
1729052	1735254	The best part about those, they're saying different games, kind of like how they have with the gamer picks and the games that you play on Xbox 360 right now.
1736852	1737172	and so on.
1761297	1762218	Create your own levels.
1762258	1763619	The entire thing's physics-based.
1763679	1766561	It's kind of similar to, like, Gary's mod in Half-Life 2.
1767582	1775889	And you create these little, almost like platformer levels that you and your friends will play and try to find their way through.
1776089	1777790	And so it's totally customizable.
1777830	1781573	You'll be able to download them, rate them, and so on and so forth.
1782034	1784556	But it's just, it looks like a lot of fun.
1784716	1788099	And it's actually selling a lot of people on the whole...
1789332	1790352	PlayStation 3 Experience
1819426	1823070	Definitely the types of things that Sony is going to need.
1824512	1828016	It's kind of like, I think we've all been waiting for something like this out of Sony.
1828496	1833241	I don't know about you guys, but this is definitely, this put the brakes on the negative Sony press bandwagon.
1833902	1836425	And now I think Sony's turned around in another direction.
1836465	1838067	But I would say the question is how much.
1838627	1840810	I've heard people say everything from, eh.
1841383	1844824	whatever, to I'm going to go out and buy a PlayStation 3 now.
1844864	1845984	This is exactly what I need.
1846144	1847705	I'm curious kind of what you guys think.
1847745	1849545	You guys are PlayStation 3 owners.
1850545	1851606	What do you think about this news?
1851866	1854246	Well, it's awesome because their current service sucks.
1854767	1859288	I mean, their PlayStation – By the way, everyone wants to know, is Black Wolf still your only friend?
1859488	1859928	No, he's not.
1860908	1876292	I do have about seven now, so thank you for those people that sent requests, that's awesome, but it's just, you know, it's basically you don't, with the whole friend request system, you don't really know who's on there unless you actually talk to people and stuff, so, but yes, thank you, I have more than one friend now, so that's awesome.
1876312	1889715	But anyway, so the surface, since I already own a PlayStation 3, you know, I personally probably wouldn't buy a PlayStation 3 for just this stuff, but it's definitely helping it, you know, it's
1890669	1892691	It makes their service look a bit nicer.
1892711	1893391	It fleshes it out.
1893411	1896754	Because before, their network service was like, well, fuck, we don't know what they're doing.
1896974	1899816	And to be honest, right now, as of right now, they haven't done anything.
1899916	1903379	So this home service is going to be pretty awesome.
1903439	1908542	It's going to be a way to actually meet people and to be able to add more friends that way.
1908783	1910384	And just a really cool community thing.
1910924	1913926	And I think it's going to have the same appeal as, like, Second Life or Sims.
1914006	1915588	I mean, people are going to be customizing their own.
1915748	1917269	You're going to see, like, you know,
1918288	1924809	Home places that are going to be themed around your websites and, you know, it's going to be crazy.
1924829	1926830	You're going to have people reporting from home.
1928330	1929711	Jamie, any thoughts on this?
1930891	1934692	You know, I have my space in LiveJournal for getting in touch with people.
1935332	1939093	I think all I would do is just sit around and mess with stuff in it like I do with The Sims.
1939133	1940213	I hate Second Life, by the way.
1942453	1944774	But it wouldn't be any...
1945732	1948975	It wouldn't make or break it for me, but since I already have it, I would use it.
1949896	1950457	That type of thing.
1952318	1958024	For me, I don't own a PlayStation 3, and I've actually had several people ask me, is this going to make you go buy a PlayStation 3?
1959105	1959285	No.
1959985	1960686	But it helps.
1961267	1963949	But again, what is the golden rule of gaming, boys and girls?
1964710	1967012	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1967652	1971536	Trust me, this is a huge step in the right direction, because I love that
1972497	1987467	You know, they've kind of done something... You know, come to think of it, I think we had a caller last week or the week before, and I'm so sorry to the caller, because I can't remember who called in and said this, but somebody called in and said, Sony is really good at ripping everybody else off and doing it a little better.
1988228	1990969	That was actually on a podcast that we listened to in the car.
1991009	1997313	Somebody else said that, but when I heard that on the podcast listening to the car, I remember somebody calling in and saying it as well.
1998174	1999595	And I thought to myself...
2001204	2005206	When we took the call on air, I was kind of like, oh yeah, okay, yeah, that's a cute thing to look at.
2005446	2008747	But I was kind of thinking when I saw this, I was like, god damn, they're right.
2008847	2012189	That person, whoever called us, stand up and take a bow, whoever did that.
2012549	2014249	Because that was absolutely right.
2014990	2020252	Because if you think about it, we all thought Microsoft's Achievement Point system was genius.
2020312	2020752	It's great.
2020812	2021412	It's wonderful.
2021512	2028455	And now we look at what PlayStation 3 is doing and we go, hmm, the Microsoft thing kind of seems kind of not as good as it could be now next to that.
2029693	2031734	They just have the problem of being there first.
2032435	2033275	Yeah, I guess so.
2034076	2035256	It's just interesting.
2035556	2037338	I still like achievements.
2037398	2046683	I still love 360 and so on and so forth, but it's just kind of interesting that Sony could still do that, even with all this negative press, kind of make a stop and go, wow, they really kind of did rip something off and make it better.
2046863	2053427	One thing to keep in mind is that as we progress, as more and more and more ideas come out,
2054381	2058484	After a while, it's very hard to innovate once you've already thought of what you can do.
2059184	2061906	The only other thing you can do is expand on the idea.
2061926	2066109	It sounds like we've never seen Nintendo doing this because they can't embrace online.
2066129	2068871	Who cares?
2070452	2080358	Well, I'm still thinking I will probably end up breaking down and buying a PlayStation 3 when some of the games I want come out like Final Fantasy XIII and the Versus and everything.
2080734	2082435	E3 this year is so critical
2106618	2110180	because I think they need to make up for zonking out last year.
2110500	2115303	And I think this year at E3, now that they've kind of set the stage, because that's kind of what they do with the game developers,
2116168	2126956	is they've kind of set the stage, everything around, the big case that PlayStation 3 is going to, you know, the big central thing now that PlayStation 3 is going to have, it's going to be about the games.
2127357	2136463	Sony needs to come out at E3 and says, here's the exclusives, here's the first party stuff we're developing, here's the stuff that's going to really make you want a PlayStation 3 now.
2136844	2139706	Because I think about like all these trailers and things we saw at,
2140686	2143207	E3 last year that we really have never heard about again ever since.
2143267	2144547	Maybe little bits and pieces here and there.
2144927	2150408	Africa with a K. Can we find out why I need Africa and why this game is going to be so flipping great?
2150428	2151468	Can we find that out this year?
2151488	2154608	Because when we saw the trailer for it, we were like, I don't get it.
2155709	2156569	What about that game?
2156589	2158449	I can't even remember what the hell the name of it was.
2158689	2163010	But remember the trailer showed like the gas station blowing up or something in the cars.
2163890	2165110	What was that with the two guys?
2165170	2165970	It looked kind of neat.
2165990	2166851	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
2166891	2167551	What the hell was that?
2167571	2168431	I don't think it's coming out.
2168611	2169211	Where did it go?
2170285	2177170	I'm kind of curious, has your guys' opinion of Sony changed at all from the home run they hit at Game Developers Conference?
2177210	2177390	Loki?
2197159	2199161	It's about time that they did something right.
2200181	2200982	So that's great.
2201342	2205405	You know, originally when I heard about Home, I thought it was going to be a rip-off of The Me's.
2205706	2207047	And no, not at all.
2207127	2208548	Now it's a rip-off of Second Life.
2208628	2213832	So, you know, if you're going to at least take a business model, at least they took the right one.
2214372	2219796	Because Second Life is really successful as far as people making money off of it.
2219976	2224139	And, you know, as soon as I saw, oh yeah, you're going to be able to buy clothing and stuff like that...
2225954	2228255	on the service and actually customize your characters.
2228315	2230076	I'm like, oh, well, cha-ching, you know.
2231156	2233237	Basically, they're going to make a lot of money.
2234397	2242680	So, I think it's great, and I do like the way that you can kind of jump in and play multiplayer games just by kind of meeting people and stuff, so that's kind of cool.
2244761	2245101	I don't know.
2245361	2247022	It's just kind of wait to see what they do with it.
2247562	2252083	Because they've been talking, like, a lot of online communities and stuff, you know, with their games that are coming out.
2252284	2253304	It's just going to be kind of...
2254181	2255622	Interesting to see how they implement everything.
2256522	2270570	We are going to open up our Skype line in a rare occurrence here just to get your feedback on this component because I think this is so big, and especially with all the whining and just kicking of Sony while they're down, people have been doing.
2270851	2275453	I'm really curious to see what our listeners think about this whole thing going in the other direction.
2275473	2276774	We are going to take some real quick calls.
2277076	2278758	Before that, though, I want to get some chat comments.
2279058	2285465	If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, and then I want to hear what Jamie has to say on this as well, if anything.
2286045	2287447	First, let me get some chat comments here.
2288968	2289509	Let's see.
2290510	2293693	I was saying that somebody here said something really good up above.
2293733	2294254	Sorry, guys.
2294294	2295535	Live radio, scrolling around.
2298638	2299119	I know the Rob.
2299139	2299479	There it is.
2299519	2300440	The Rob D. said,
2300933	2301894	This doesn't matter to me.
2302054	2302875	I need games.
2303055	2304756	Not a Trojan Horse Media Center.
2304856	2305917	Give me games.
2306357	2307358	It would be a good bonus.
2308839	2309240	Let's see.
2310140	2315225	Illusion says, yeah, a new Sims game comes out and someone says, I like the Sims better when it was called PlayStation Home.
2315265	2318247	I think kind of making a joke about how Sony kind of rips things off and does it better.
2319428	2319848	Let's see.
2320729	2326694	James Patrick says, all PlayStation 3 only games are shallow and suck except for Resistance even now.
2327854	2330935	and Zappy, I believe, saved the day there earlier in chat.
2330955	2333716	Zappy believes that the game I was talking about was called Eight Days.
2334496	2335056	That sounds right.
2335636	2336857	That does sound right to me as well.
2337797	2340998	DarkSakura, do you have anything you want to say about the whole Sony?
2341018	2344839	Has your opinion of them changed, or you still think they're eating crayons over there, or what?
2345139	2348400	I still think they're eating crayons, but this is a step away from the crayons.
2348440	2351941	I think that they've moved away from crayons to like, you know... Paste.
2351961	2352181	Paste.
2354960	2357522	because paste at least is, you know, flour-based.
2357562	2358722	Yeah, organic a little bit.
2358742	2365607	Yeah, they're eating paste in those little, you know, star-shaped, you know, string cheese nuggets.
2365767	2366107	Lovely.
2366167	2369069	All right, let's go to the Skype line and see what people think on this.
2369389	2370770	Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
2371350	2371991	You scared me.
2372091	2373532	Raven Stolfen.
2373632	2373912	Boo.
2373992	2374712	Hi, Raven Stolfen.
2374732	2376574	What do you think about Sony at GDC?
2377514	2379816	It's definitely a step into the right direction.
2379956	2381537	Are you a PlayStation 3 owner currently?
2382417	2382958	I wish.
2383178	2383418	No.
2383438	2383478	No.
2384143	2385384	No, I've been wishing.
2385444	2385604	Yeah.
2385664	2387125	I thought home was a very good idea.
2387145	2390207	The only thing I want to do is just stream porn from my hard drive to my TV.
2409571	2411891	You know, you can kind of do that anyway.
2412012	2414172	Well, I don't know about the hard drive on your computer.
2414272	2419173	I think you can stream the movies on your TV, but I'm looking at some FAQs that came out about it.
2419233	2425394	And one of the questions that was posed about PlayStation Home, can I launch and watch a BD movie from within home?
2425774	2426655	Launch, yes.
2426895	2427695	Watch, no.
2427975	2433156	So I think some people were thinking that you'd be able to put like a porno on the TV in your apartment and that would play.
2433878	2438482	You could go to that and launch the movie, but it won't actually play the porno in your apartment.
2438702	2439883	At least that's the impression I'm getting.
2440163	2444907	The logistics of that seems like it would be a real bandwidth eater anyway, so it's probably for the best, right?
2445207	2445947	I got bandwidth.
2447949	2458737	I think it will actually stream whatever it is on that TV because they said they had dynamic sound or something like that where as you walk closer to the source it will get louder and that kind of thing.
2461303	2463705	What do you think should be Sony's next move, RavensDolphin?
2463725	2464786	What should they do at E3?
2466528	2467069	I don't know.
2467649	2474557	I think they should definitely put home in a good response, but I definitely agree that they need games to support the home.
2475238	2477360	More games to support home would be a home run.
2477785	2480107	So maybe some games that incorporate the home thing into it.
2480267	2487013	Because one thing that's interesting about what Sony is doing versus what Microsoft is doing is Microsoft requires developers to put achievements in the games.
2487393	2492918	Sony is just kind of letting it be there, and if developers want to have things in it, then great.
2492958	2503126	Like, you know, when you beat Final Fantasy XIII, let's say, if Square wants to give you a little cloud sword, even though cloud's not in Final Fantasy XIII, I don't know, humor me here for a minute.
2503410	2516219	A little cloud sword that you could put in your Playstation home That would be up to them, completely So, kind of interesting Yeah, two more things Alright, hurry First, voice chat You have to buy a Bluetooth headset and a USB Are you?
2517880	2529268	I already have one for my 360 So it's going to be a tough sell on Sony Sony will need to tell me why I need it Okay, and the next thing about the trophies Did you see that room?
2530601	2538683	I saw some of the videos, I did see, yeah, it looked like one room had a crap load of trophies, but maybe from all the arcade titles, I don't know.
2539283	2542864	And one thing from Second Life, so am I going to launch pink dicks at people that I don't like?
2543124	2547185	I have a feeling since this community is going to be a little more moderated, probably not.
2547245	2550806	And I don't think, with Second Life you can kind of user create things, right?
2550846	2553667	I haven't done a lot of Second Life, but there's more user creation in that, right?
2554087	2555627	I don't think you really get that so much here.
2555647	2559428	You get user customization, but not so much creation.
2559960	2561560	All right, thanks so much for the call, Raven Stolfen.
2562001	2562601	You're welcome, Bob.
2562621	2563081	Have a good one.
2563541	2566562	All right, we'll take one more call and some feedback with the Sony stuff.
2566582	2571563	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username is Orange Lounge Radio, over on Skype.
2572023	2574804	Of course, we encourage you guys to interact with our program.
2574824	2575584	That's what we're here for.
2576144	2579785	We're just three folks that like video games just like the rest of you.
2579845	2581365	We want to hear what you guys have to say as well.
2581665	2582366	Let's take another call.
2582946	2583786	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2583806	2584106	Who's this?
2585267	2586787	Hey, it's SSJ100 Matt.
2586947	2588087	Hi, SSJ100 Matt.
2588108	2590288	What do you think about this whole Sony home thing?
2591288	2593248	Actually, I'm liking it a lot.
2593949	2594829	You're liking it a lot?
2595429	2599790	Were you somebody that wanted a PlayStation 3 before Game Developers Conference?
2603370	2606851	I actually know originally I was split between a 360 and a PS3.
2607691	2608931	So what do you think now?
2611152	2612912	Well, now I've got to start thinking about...
2614321	2628125	The PS3 now, so I'm still, before I was like, you know, like majority 360, now, you know, I'm like back in the middle, so I'm gonna wait until, you know, this home thing picks up around October and then, you know, I'll make a decision.
2628285	2631366	What is it about home that puts you back in the middle with all this?
2632766	2643449	Well, you know, originally, you know, I used to play The Sims a lot, you know, that was like basically my, like, guilty pleasure, that thing was like crack, so this is kind of like The Sims, so, you know,
2644875	2651018	I know I'm going to be on this thing customizing buying crap to make my place look good.
2651678	2655240	Speaking of customizing LittleBigPlanet, is that something that appeals to you?
2656661	2657461	It looks really nice.
2657521	2669427	I think it will be great because I think they said something that they're going to come out with a full version where it's just going to basically be user-created...
2670879	2672400	and many, many, many more.
2700728	2702349	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2728430	2745733	and he walks around with you and he growls when he smells the people sneaking up on you and you can't really tell him what to do but you can gesture to him and he'll learn to follow, well he'll always follow you but he'll go along with you and be your puppy and lick your face and eat your chickens and that type of thing.
2745753	2746773	Wait, he'll eat your chickens?
2746793	2747773	That's not good.
2749474	2751834	Do the chickens fight back like they did in Zelda?
2752554	2753134	I don't know.
2754094	2757635	But I wish they had cats.
2759093	2761774	That was kind of disappointing, because I'm more of a cat person.
2761914	2764034	But then again, I suppose the cat would control you.
2764755	2771777	Well, apparently you can also be a pregnant woman and catch diseases.
2771917	2774317	You can get knocked up within Fable 2.
2774778	2775698	You can have sex.
2775798	2778019	You can have unprotected sex and protected sex.
2778159	2779239	You can get STDs.
2781357	2783978	I'm taking the fantasy out of my game.
2784478	2786378	How many different kinds of sex can you have?
2786799	2789439	Is there going to be a whole Kama Sutra?
2789719	2790900	Will butt sex be involved?
2791580	2792100	Possibly.
2792140	2794521	They had gay relationships in the first game.
2794801	2796341	Butt sex is not just a gay thing.
2797021	2797762	Well, that's true.
2798462	2798822	Good point.
2799661	2801442	But the dog, though, is pretty awesome, though.
2801462	2811304	They're saying that you're actually going to care for this dog, and it loves you, and it will try to keep you safe and stuff like that.
2811684	2812285	And it's pretty cool.
2812305	2821827	They have some videos on GameVideos.com, basically talking about the whole dog aspect of the game, and it just looks awesome.
2821867	2822627	I really want it.
2822987	2824948	It's way better than Nintendogs.
2825800	2826200	and M64.
2826300	2827441	I'm sorry.
2827761	2831023	DDR Dollar Bill says, I want to have sex without e-herpes.
2831863	2832483	And let's see.
2832503	2834464	DDR Dollar Bill says, surprise butt sex.
2835705	2838566	I guess that's something you could do in the game is, you know, surprise butt sex on people.
2839247	2839587	I don't know.
2839727	2840107	Probably not.
2840767	2841648	I just don't know.
2841788	2846210	I mean, if I were going to have something useful, I'd have like a pet, you know, wolf.
2846983	2850104	SSJ100Mad says, do we get extra points for donkey punching?
2850385	2851105	I want a pitbull.
2851605	2854686	And NM64 says, everyone has AIDS.
2855227	2859208	Because if you're allowed to run around and have unprotected sex in the game, that's the likely conclusion.
2859228	2862470	I wonder if you could start like an epidemic in-game.
2862530	2863730	It's kind of weird.
2864011	2868392	But I suppose this answers the question now about what was the big secret about Fable.
2868412	2870874	It's puppy dogs and diseases.
2871234	2871654	I guess so.
2871754	2872214	There you have it.
2872654	2876296	DDRDollarBill says, you're going to have to buy your condoms with your MS points.
2879056	2879576	That's funny.
2879917	2882298	Little microtransactions out the wazoo.
2882338	2885301	Yeah, maybe you'll be able to get a cat, but you'll have to pay some points for it.
2885381	2885721	I don't know.
2886522	2886842	All right.
2888463	2891125	Well, there were... You have to change the litter or you die of methane poisoning.
2891605	2896529	There were some other announcements that came out of Game Developers Conference, and I love me some Mizuguchi.
2897049	2901032	Of course, Mizuguchi, the fine fellow who created Rez.
2902093	2903274	I believe Space Channel 5.
2903974	2904415	Luminous...
2905703	2910594	Meteos, some of the great escapes 99 Nights, not so much feeling the love there
2910936	2940136	But everybody's allowed to make a mistake Well, make no mistake here, every Xtend Extra Extreme is coming to Xbox Live Arcade And it looks like the audio and visual sexcapade that you would be expecting from Mizuguchi I mean, just kind of look at these screenshots here Of course, every Xtend Extra was a game that was out on the PSP They're going to be making this version as well for Xbox Live Arcade And of course they're calling it E4 for short Because every Xtend Extra Extreme, get it, there's all the E's there
2940523	2941624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2962159	2963620	I mean, it has puzzle elements.
2963660	2964761	You have to think about what you're doing.
2964801	2966021	But it is kind of an action game.
2966082	2967422	So it's unique.
2967763	2969404	And I'm a big supporter of unique games.
2969444	2972085	So this was a perfect announcement for Game Developers Conference.
2972165	2976248	So check that out on Xbox Live Marketplace when it becomes available.
2976748	2977849	Probably later this year.
2978349	2979810	At least as far as we know.
2979850	2981671	Yeah, late, late this year.
2981831	2982232	Christmas.
2982592	2982852	Christmas.
2983294	2986555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3006155	3006615	DarkSakura
3025297	3030619	I had thought that Microsoft already confirmed this, so I was kind of surprised to see this making the rounds on news sites again.
3030639	3035980	Well, they sort of confirmed it, and then they made a press release about it, so now it's official, official, I guess.
3036000	3043222	These stages of gaming news, especially Microsoft gaming news, because Microsoft news always starts out as a rumor first, because Microsoft rumors...
3043982	3045183	99% of the time are true.
3045583	3054227	So there's a Microsoft rumor and then it evolves into random dude at Microsoft or a Microsoft blogger said, yeah, we're working on it, shh, don't tell.
3054627	3056528	And then it evolves into like a press release.
3056808	3058128	And then it's like, oh, it's official now.
3058548	3062750	Microsoft has said, hail the larger Xbox Live arcade games.
3064291	3066852	I'm sure every X10 Extra will benefit from that 150 megs.
3067252	3068593	Here's the other thing I want to know, though.
3069513	3071214	Now that the arcade limit has been upped
3071789	3073934	Mr. Mizuguchi and everybody over at Q Entertainment.
3074575	3080086	Whatever happened, it's been like a year now, whatever happened to Madonna and Luminous?
3080791	3082833	And I'm not just saying Madonna specifically.
3083253	3085655	Contrary to popular belief, I could give two shits about Madonna.
3085895	3088137	But I'm talking about the licensed music in general.
3089538	3092741	We got one song, Heavenly Star, which was an in-house thing anyway.
3093241	3095443	Where's the rest of the content that's supposed to be in Luminous?
3095823	3096604	No content for you.
3096804	3097604	I guess not.
3097725	3098966	Sorry, I got on a tangent there.
3098986	3101187	This is supposed to be about the thing.
3101568	3103069	Talking about Mizuguchi made me think about that.
3103109	3105751	What the hell ever happened to Madonna, etc.?
3106011	3106712	The puppy ate it.
3107673	3108413	I guess so.
3108793	3109454	The dog ate it.
3111964	3116086	Well, you know something that you don't really have to worry about?
3117287	3117727	Well, I don't know.
3117747	3118908	I'm sort of worried about this.
3119568	3125791	Peter Jackson is doing some episodic content for a couple of Xbox 360 games, and one of them is Halo.
3126372	3128513	And I'm wondering, dude, what's he going to do for Halo?
3128533	3131174	It would be very interesting.
3131594	3135056	There's not too many details about it, and I don't think anything on what the other game is.
3136497	3139158	It looks like it's still in development, but
3140723	3141644	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3165264	3170227	It seems like episodic content has become this real buzzword of the past couple of years, hasn't it?
3170487	3172548	It seems like everybody and their mom's doing episodic content.
3174229	3177051	What could they really do for Halo episodic content, you think?
3177091	3181113	Do you think this is something they'll do like two and then say, oh, there was your episodic content?
3181353	3183374	Or is this something you could see actually going on for a while?
3183394	3185315	I mean, God, if any community could support...
3185814	3192777	I would see this happening after Halo 3 and it would be for Halo 3, not its own game.
3193117	3198079	Just like additional story, single player stuff, or co-op missions or stuff like that.
3198339	3203121	It's kind of similar to the co-op missions in Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter or something like that.
3203701	3207303	It's not really episodic content, it's just downloadable content later on.
3207763	3213105	Because, to be honest, there aren't that many episodic content games out there.
3213125	3215106	I mean, even Half-Life or whatever...
3215686	3219847	They're only up to Episode 2, and 2 hasn't even come out yet.
3219927	3221407	You know I'm going to say Sam & Max.
3221427	3223828	Sam & Max, yeah, that's one that's actually pretty good.
3224208	3226249	But what else besides that?
3226869	3230029	I agree, Sam & Max is like the only ones that seem to be doing it right.
3230830	3234471	It's a buzzword thrown out there a lot, and it's not being done.
3234671	3238151	I mean, it's just like digital distribution for movies and stuff.
3238552	3240292	Everyone talks about it, but it's hardly done.
3240677	3242938	We gotta check in with the chatroom because there's some funnies.
3242978	3252064	Of course, going back to me bitching about the whole Luminous thing, Joshi16 kind of combined the stories together and says, Madonna would give you the herpes achievement, Sky.
3252405	3258929	So, insinuating that maybe Madonna will actually be in Fable to give you the STDs that you can get inside the game.
3258989	3261570	So that's certainly an interesting thought from Joshi16.
3262331	3265153	Let's see, Laser is a winner for this reference.
3265713	3267794	Maybe the dingo ate your content!
3269916	3270036	Ahhhh!
3271775	3273076	Now I'm getting all Meryl Streep.
3273116	3274616	The dingo ate the baby!
3274997	3276037	Anyway, let's see.
3278198	3279239	You're so winner for that comment.
3280459	3282260	What else was there about episodic content?
3282280	3284482	I thought it was very interesting here in chat room.
3284822	3288043	Well, Fire Safety says there are already giant monkeys in Halo.
3288524	3291965	So I guess you can't really say that that's what Peter Jackson is going to bring to the table.
3293866	3294287	Let's see.
3295987	3300810	Fire Safety also says hopefully it's nothing like Half-Life 2 periodic yearly maybe content.
3301385	3304849	Funnydale says episodic content equals three-hour games every year.
3305389	3310034	Yep, that's basically what it's been so far, so I'm hoping Halo will break that mold.
3311816	3312176	We'll see.
3313217	3320064	Well, this is not a happy story here, but some news came out about Castle Crashers.
3320424	3324629	Loki, you were all excited about Castle Crashers, because this is the game that kind of looks like...
3325270	3329413	It looks like an old school arcade, like hit the buttons, hack and slash type thing.
3329653	3330714	Like a brand new one.
3330734	3331835	This looks awesome.
3332275	3340080	Well, when approached, Behemoth's Dan Paladin, they won actually an IGF award.
3340120	3342062	And Dan Paladin actually commented on the game.
3342422	3347665	He noted that the Xbox Live title still had, quote, about a year of development left.
3348426	3351688	Meaning the Castle Crashers looks like it'll now be out in 2008.
3351768	3351828	Wow.
3354008	3354729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3365290	3366451	Thanks to the size increase.
3366491	3370355	So maybe good things will come to those who wait in terms of what's there.
3370435	3373137	So I know you were really anxious about this game, Loki.
3373798	3376100	Are you okay with this delay if it's going to make the game better?
3376420	3377121	Are you pissed?
3377381	3379983	Do you wish they'd just released something now and maybe do a Castle Crashers 2?
3380324	3380524	What?
3380824	3382526	Oh, I'm fine with them delaying the game.
3382646	3387950	Most likely, even if it wasn't because of this, it would be delayed for some other reason.
3388011	3389232	I mean, who cares?
3389272	3391714	There's supposedly more content coming out now, so...
3392677	3393817	I'm fine holding off on that.
3393837	3395838	I mean, it's one of those games that look neat.
3395858	3397899	I wasn't like, oh, I've got to have this now.
3398599	3400740	I mean, big deal.
3401040	3401320	I don't know.
3401340	3401740	I can wait.
3402881	3403181	All right.
3403741	3408002	Well, I don't know, but game delays, they kind of get me a little bit angsty.
3408162	3415105	I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but, you know, any time a game I look forward to gets delayed, whether it be for the right reason or not, I get a little pissed off.
3415165	3415585	What about you?
3416578	3416978	Sometimes.
3417258	3421499	So that means that because we're pissed off, well, this is one of those times, DarkSakura.
3421539	3422919	Help me out here because we've got a segue.
3422939	3423759	Roar!
3423819	3424199	Thank you.
3424239	3425480	Into the FUs of the week.
3436862	3440582	My FU of the week is, as usual, traffic-based.
3441442	3444143	Fuck you to men with small penises who drive big trucks.
3445253	3447574	and also fuck you to Sakura moms who drive SUVs.
3448574	3449214	I leave it at that.
3449854	3450214	Loki!
3452115	3457196	Fuck the fact that I can't find two files for Pop Station for the PSP.
3457876	3460457	And those are two important files that I need to make things work.
3460877	3466498	I did find, however, though, there is one game that I have that I really should put on my PSP and that is Einhander.
3467239	3468339	That would be fucking awesome.
3470640	3471420	That's it.
3472100	3472400	All right.
3472968	3480116	I didn't have really anything that... Oh, fuck to the fact that this room is like a scorching... I don't know, it's like a... I think somebody turned the fan off.
3480156	3481257	I'm gonna go check that thing.
3481297	3482118	It's like fucking hot in here.
3482138	3482638	It is.
3482918	3483619	It's just me.
3484800	3485421	No, I know.
3485481	3486222	I'm burning up here too.
3486262	3487603	I'll go look at the temperature in a minute.
3487904	3492248	But I want to say my FU of the week would go to Daylight Savings Time.
3492648	3493429	Oh my god.
3494711	3496012	Ugh, I hate Daylight Savings Time.
3497659	3499700	How dare you rob me of an hour of my sleep.
3499780	3503941	I don't care if there's farmer kids with school or whatever the hell reason they say.
3504281	3507422	Energy consumption, whatever the hell excuse they have.
3508323	3509903	F you, Daylight Savings, time to go die in a fire.
3510963	3512844	Hey, that was a pretty short FUs of the Week segment.
3514065	3515125	I'm kind of sad a little bit.
3516565	3517526	Well, don't be sad.
3519086	3521987	Anyways, there's one reason you shouldn't be sad.
3522287	3524068	Xbox Live hit 6 million users.
3524921	3542546	They apparently did this four months earlier than they had expected and not a big surprise because, you know, they offer those two-day subscriptions and pretty much anyone that plugs in, you know, their console into the internet, they are logged into Xbox Live.
3544086	3547407	So, and they didn't really say what the six million mark meant.
3547487	3552829	I mean, whether that's going to be silver or gold or whatever, I don't know.
3553109	3553389	So,
3554332	3555052	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3573736	3576757	I have kind of noticed, what about Rayman Raving Rabbids on the 360?
3577477	3581098	Oh, I'm guessing that's going to be about as good as any iToy game.
3581318	3582478	That's a damn good point.
3582538	3585378	When was the last time anyone said anything about the Xbox Live camera?
3586559	3590099	And why is it we haven't gotten more games like Uno?
3590540	3602462	You would think, based on the success of Uno, that we would have seen like, you know, we would see like Old Maid and like freaking Skip Bow and I don't know, whatever else card games and casual games they can come up with on Xbox Live by now.
3603030	3604091	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3630828	3632970	As was announced at a Game Developers Conference.
3633291	3633871	Isn't that cool?
3634912	3638496	And I'm thinking that I've actually been really excited about this, you know.
3640257	3645603	I mean, I'm still sort of back and forth, but we have to wait until August to get it.
3645663	3650748	And so I think by then I'll decide whether or not I really am going to be able to dedicate the time to another RPG, but I think it's going to be awesome.
3653206	3657270	I think there were a couple more details on Blue Dragon this week because I thought about Loki.
3657310	3661213	You said already on this show like a month ago that Blue Dragon was coming out over here.
3661554	3663476	I think you might have said July, but whatever.
3663516	3664476	It got delayed a couple weeks.
3664516	3665297	Big whoop, right?
3665617	3666879	But we all knew it was coming over here.
3666919	3674826	But I seem to remember one cool thing that I remember reading about Blue Dragon is that they're going to have both the English language and Japanese language tracks in it.
3675006	3676427	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3702154	3708319	Joshi16 will not let the Madonna thing go because Joshi says Madonna needs a live arcade camera game.
3708639	3711642	Dude, you need to get your issues worked out there with Madonna.
3712462	3713724	Let's see, what else do we have here?
3714004	3716706	Blaze says simply, fuck the Xbox Live camera.
3717227	3717927	There you have it.
3717947	3721210	Mori agrees Xbox 360 Skipbo would be amazing.
3721510	3724253	You know what would be more amazing than Xbox 360 Skipbo?
3724293	3725734	And props to you if you know this game.
3726469	3730192	I might be horribly pronouncing it because it's French, but this is like my favorite card game ever.
3731093	3732434	Xbox 360 Millborn.
3733534	3737797	You ever played that game with the roll and stop and punctured tires?
3737878	3739158	It's like a racing card game.
3739439	3740640	Oh my god, it's the best game ever.
3740740	3741700	I love that card game.
3742001	3745083	Bring me my Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade.
3746624	3746884	Sorry.
3748065	3748926	I'm ranty tonight.
3749386	3750947	I'm a demanding little bitch tonight.
3750967	3751407	I'm sorry.
3753009	3753509	I'll be good.
3758246	3760367	Oh, I'm sorry, we've got release dates to talk about.
3761889	3762209	Wow.
3762569	3763270	Live radio.
3763290	3767013	See, I get all ranty, and then I completely forget about talking about release dates.
3767413	3773478	But I suppose we should talk about the Japanese release dates, because these are usually the things that we're going to see over here in the U.S.
3773538	3775779	before too long, or over in Europe as well.
3776880	3783005	Well, coming out on the Xbox 360, not a lot, except some games are going into the Platinum Collection on March 15th.
3783365	3786828	So you can now get Battlefield 2, Burnout, Chromehounds, Perfect Dark Zero...
3787259	3788860	All of the lower price over in Japan.
3789500	3793362	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, you get GI Jockey Wii is coming out.
3794263	3797404	Sonic 2 Himitsu Ring is coming out on March 15th.
3797705	3799986	That would just be Sonic and the Secret Rings.
3801206	3805529	SpongeBob SquarePants also making its way to Japanese audiences also on March 15th.
3805569	3806649	We're sorry, Japan.
3806789	3807710	Sorry, Japan, for that.
3808250	3811752	Sometimes things from our culture will stink up your things.
3812525	3818687	on the PlayStation 3 Fight Night Round 3 making its way to Japan on March 15th as well as a game called Dust Cap 3.
3820087	3825208	I don't know about you, but I've never heard of Dust... Oh, it's... That's not a game.
3825268	3825828	That's why.
3828269	3828589	Wow.
3828889	3829669	I need help tonight.
3831150	3835151	Dust Cap 3 is just an accessory that's literally... Because I was like, whatever happened to Dust Cap 3?
3835331	3837451	I was like, what the hell is Dust Cap 1 and 2?
3837511	3840932	Sounds like the name of some either weird RPG or puzzle game.
3842912	3843232	DustCap 1 and 2
3871923	3874044	Princess Maker 4 is coming out.
3874084	3879686	So if you've ever wanted to be your own princess, now you can for a much lower price because that's going into the best hits.
3879706	3881426	I don't think that's exactly what that's about.
3883907	3885728	It's called Princess Maker 4.
3885808	3886528	How can it not be?
3886848	3887829	Look at the box art.
3888229	3891410	Doesn't that look like princesses having a good time there?
3892068	3893009	Let's see, look at the description.
3893389	3900113	Princess Maker 4 is the fourth installment of the popular promotion simulation game in which you become the father guardian of a young girl.
3900373	3902815	You must raise her to become a princess in eight years.
3903175	3903435	See?
3903715	3904996	It is Princess Maker.
3905076	3905496	That's lame.
3905656	3906337	STFU.
3906377	3907477	You don't know what you're talking about.
3909779	3910179	Anyways.
3910799	3911380	Wait, I have more.
3913661	3915522	Dust Cap 4 is coming out in 2008.
3915802	3916263	Look for it.
3916863	3918364	No, on Nintendo DS real quick.
3918975	3923736	Bionicle Heroes, the Konami Arcade Collection is coming out over there in Japan.
3924737	3931978	Also, Kuro Kuro Princess and Lost in Blue 2 is coming out on March 15th as well.
3932419	3934919	And Fingerprint Guard Film Light.
3936380	3936760	Just kidding.
3936780	3937260	I love that one.
3937280	3937620	Just kidding.
3937660	3938500	I knew that wasn't a game.
3940601	3941101	Alright, I'm done.
3941341	3941621	Anyways.
3942174	3948839	US, pretty much as far as games go, there's really one big one this week, and that would be God of War 2, coming out in PlayStation 2.
3949759	3951961	PSP's not seeing much else either.
3952501	3957044	Call of Duty 3, Road to Victory, that's going to be coming out as well this week.
3957685	3966671	The 360, we're just getting a re-release of Call of Duty 3, the Gold Edition, now with downloadable maps actually included in there.
3966691	3971174	I believe you get tokens for that, and some special behind-the-scenes DVD or something.
3971714	3972154	Lame.
3973275	3976316	For the PlayStation 3, you're getting College Hoops 2K7.
3976936	3977577	Hooray.
3978077	3980318	And let's see.
3980858	3984039	For PC, quite a bit of stuff coming out.
3984499	3985700	None of it looks very good, though.
3987501	3988801	Some highlights.
3988821	3990842	The Top Spin 2 is coming to the PC.
3991602	3993243	Battlefield 2 Complete.
3995364	3996985	And yeah, the rest sucks.
3997645	3999726	For the Wii, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07.
4000856	4001837	Get your golf on.
4002157	4010284	And then for the DS, you have Mind Quiz, and that's another ripoff of Brain Age.
4010484	4012606	Can I say another game I played this week real quick?
4013607	4021393	I played Quiz and Dragons with Bobby Blackwolf, and we were so horrible at that game, words cannot describe it.
4022236	4032445	The handicap we will need on future games of Quiz and Dragons, which is now on Altercade, apparently, even though Altercade, you know, we're a little meh, but yeah, Quiz and Dragons will own you.
4033606	4042854	Herbie Rescue Rally DS, which is a port of a crappy movie made into a crappy game, now on the DS, and it looks crappy.
4043795	4044075	That's it.
4046075	4047016	I just have to say real quick.
4047036	4048337	Sorry, chat.
4048417	4048697	No, Rob.
4048717	4049177	It's chat.
4049197	4049657	It's chat.
4049757	4049957	Okay.
4050258	4053119	The chat room was making fun of my fuck up earlier.
4053639	4056661	Dark Tetsuya says, Dust Cap 3, Dust Cap's revenge.
4057241	4059903	Firebomb says, Dust Cap 3 gets more incredible.
4060343	4064205	And Illusion makes the mandatory Dust Cap 3 electric boogaloo.
4064585	4065646	That'd be Dust Cap 2.
4067647	4069948	Anyway, how about our European releases?
4070248	4070749	How about it?
4071229	4072249	A Bunch of Crap on the 16th and...
4074443	4075604	Yeah, maybe some of it's kind of crap.
4075644	4076264	Some of it's kind of cool.
4076685	4103304	We have Call of Duty 3, Championship Manager 2007, Free Running, Legend of the Dragon, Lunar Knights, Vampire Hunters, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Justice for All, Puzzle Quest, Challenge of the Warlords, Rayman, Raving Rabbids, Rome Total War, Saint Seiya, The Hades, Summer Warriors 2 Empires, Spectrobes, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on DS, Test Drive Unlimited, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07, and UFO Extraterrestrials.
4104839	4105660	Electronic Arts and Harmonics
4129904	4142813	and it was just a real brief thing that came out, was leaked to the media this week that Electronic Arts announced they have penned a deal with MTV Networks and Harmonix to publish Harmonix's next game.
4143273	4146135	However, what that game is, is a secret for now.
4146656	4158204	So it's interesting though because, you know, obviously Guitar Hero was something that Red Octane published but now EA is going to be filling that role for whatever Harmonix's next game is.
4159492	4169095	I seem to remember previously said, and it looks like this article makes reference to it too, Harmonix once said that Guitar Hero is just the tip of the iceberg, just the beginning of what these games can become.
4169555	4175517	And I seem to remember Harmonix saying that their next project was like way bigger than Guitar Hero, like a real thing.
4176117	4179678	And a lot of people speculate it's going to be a game that really teaches you how to play guitar.
4180998	4181358	I don't know.
4182419	4183859	I'm still waiting for Sax Maniacs.
4184754	4193778	I kind of wish they'd bring back the Amplitude thing in some new evolved regard, because I did love me some Amplitude.
4193798	4196499	They could evolve the game, make it next-gen somehow, a little more competitive.
4196519	4198080	They need Kraken DJ over here.
4198820	4202002	Crackin' DJ was not even a Harmonix, that was a Sega game.
4202062	4203363	I don't care, it's still fun.
4203744	4205445	Crackin' DJ, I haven't heard that in years.
4205465	4215693	But at least Crackin' DJ sort of made you feel like you were actually remixing stuff because you're going through the same motions an actual DJ would, so that was kind of neat.
4217494	4222978	And I will be kick-banning users in chatroom who said that the game Harmonix is making is Dust Cap 4.
4223239	4224880	Let the joke die, you assholes.
4225500	4227222	I think we have the start of a brand new...
4228323	4229724	A joke to beat into the ground.
4229744	4231305	Dust Cap 4, bust a cap.
4231805	4232586	I saw that in there.
4232606	4233166	That was funny.
4233486	4235347	Ha ha ha.
4235948	4239210	Anyways, so more EA news, of course.
4240110	4247094	They are kicking off an online music competition featuring singing sensation Lily Allen.
4247194	4248195	Who the fuck that is?
4248795	4253458	I'm not, you know, hip to these artists out there.
4253538	4256800	But anyways, apparently Lily Allen, they're doing...
4258109	4259130	I guess this is coinciding.
4259150	4260691	Let me just put this in perspective for people.
4260791	4266673	If the music doesn't sound like pooch, pooch, mew, mew, mew, mew, pooch, pooch, mew, mew, mew, then Loki doesn't listen to it.
4266753	4270815	Yes, if it's not cat techno, it's not for me.
4271196	4272456	So, anyways.
4273357	4279800	No, but apparently she's doing a version of her song, Smile, for Sims 2.
4279840	4284982	It's going to be in Simlish, which makes it sound even more retarded.
4285022	4286823	So, very excellent.
4288646	4297773	Just so you know, Lily Allen is a newer artist who has recently peaked at the number two position in the UK with her single, Alright Still.
4298214	4300395	And it actually peaked at number 20 here in the US.
4301096	4302997	And that is who Lily Allen is.
4303077	4305159	And I've seen this, I've probably heard this song before.
4306009	4307110	Don't make me pull up a clip.
4308510	4310411	To which I would say, all right, still don't care.
4312632	4328198	But if you do win this contest, though, you will be winning a prize package worth approximately $1,390 and have a chance to record a song in Simlish for possible inclusion in a future Sims 2 game.
4329239	4329459	So...
4330689	4336356	Great, you get to sing a song in gibberish that's going to appear in a game that probably no one will actually pay attention to the music in.
4336376	4337437	That sounds awesome!
4337998	4339219	I want to sing a song in gibberish.
4344945	4345466	That's my song.
4345666	4346788	Lily Allen, you listening?
4347508	4349371	You could totally sample me on your next record.
4352091	4352972	Rob... So how about SingStar?
4369217	4373959	and they are going to be doing this thing called Game 3.0.
4374439	4376699	It's a very interesting thing.
4377740	4383561	Basically, you're going to be able to download new content but upload content as well using your USB camera.
4383601	4391943	You can record videos and then everyone will look at it so it'd be like, you know, like the Numa Numa kid or something.
4393284	4397465	Dear God who is in heaven, please listen to this boy's prayer.
4397972	4400594	I've been a very good Rob this whole year long.
4400955	4417449	Please, please, please, God Almighty who art in heaven, please, please make Loki get really drunk one night and record some videos on SingStar and upload them to this Game 3 point whatever service so that the entirety of the internet can download and make fun of him.
4417970	4418890	Thank you, amen.
4418970	4419271	What?
4420151	4421292	God doesn't listen to you.
4423474	4425216	Come on, Loki, you know you want to do it.
4426778	4427859	You want me to do that?
4427879	4427959	I do!
4427979	4429420	I don't want to do that at all.
4429560	4431041	I am not touching that fucking game.
4431882	4434083	Karaoke will not be entering my house.
4434603	4435344	Fuck that shit.
4440347	4444330	GS68 says, I don't know, it makes me think of a Caturday macro.
4444370	4447311	It says, I'm in your OLRs, drunk in your hosts.
4449553	4450513	Maybe that's God speaking.
4450534	4451614	We all know we're all going to hell.
4451634	4452375	Probably.
4452395	4452775	Probably.
4453300	4454942	Except not me because I don't believe in hell.
4454962	4456544	I'm going to wherever pagan people go.
4456825	4457986	Let's not turn this into religious.
4458166	4459108	We're not a god cast.
4459248	4461791	Go look up god cast on iTunes if you want religious stuff.
4461871	4462732	We've got to talk about games.
4463113	4466157	And one game that we'll talk about here is Warhawk.
4467352	4472634	It's interesting because Warhawk, you know, of course, went that it was going to be downloadable only when it went over to the PlayStation 3.
4473214	4474435	Here's the other thing you need to know.
4474495	4476316	Warhawk is not going to be single player now.
4476416	4479257	It's going to be a multiplayer only battle arena.
4479737	4483318	Since the game has moved into the PlayStation Network, it's a downloadable title.
4483859	4486179	It's only going to be something that you can play online.
4486780	4489261	But the cool news is that, hey, you don't get to just do planes.
4489281	4493042	You can do jeeps, tanks, infantry units, and the whole works there.
4493122	4495523	So you get some other online modes as well, but
4495922	4498124	If you don't like to play online games, too bad.
4498344	4500145	Warhawk will not be for you on the PlayStation 3.
4514469	4525556	So, when you think about high-end computer systems, you probably don't think of Commodore, but they're hoping to change that, because now they are back, and they are trying to make a name for themselves.
4525716	4531881	If the year was 1984, I would be thinking about Commodore, because the Commodore 64 was my first gaming platform, really, truly.
4532781	4534983	Commodore 64 is an amazing piece of machinery.
4535263	4535543	Amen.
4536645	4546808	So yeah, now they're launching a new Commodore PC geared for PC gaming and it's supposed to launch at Germany's C-Bit show actually this week on March 15th.
4547588	4550728	And I don't know.
4551009	4554049	They're basically saying this can provide what gamers need and want.
4555950	4556390	Excellent.
4556870	4558370	Can I play Last Ninja on it?
4558430	4559010	Yes or no?
4559971	4560571	I think better.
4561431	4565392	Because if not, there's going to be one hell of a syntax error coming out of this
4566047	4566607	Angry Gamer.
4568128	4569328	That was a Commodore joke.
4570068	4570608	Don't laugh at once.
4570628	4572329	Yeah, that's why no one got it.
4573449	4576490	That's why we're on the internet, boys and girls, not satellite radio or the real deal.
4576510	4578471	Maybe we should call ourselves Video Obscura.
4579471	4580051	That'd be an awesome name.
4580071	4581552	That's actually not a bad name for a podcast.
4581852	4583852	At least Video Gamer Obscura.
4585453	4589854	At least people would know we're a video game podcast as opposed to when people go, what the hell's Orange Lounge Radio?
4590034	4591775	Are you guys a lounge music podcast?
4592315	4595156	Yeah, we just had Richard Cheese on last week.
4597245	4605527	Speaking of cheese, there is a LEGO MMO that is in development coming in 2008.
4606007	4612229	It's being developed by NetDevil for AutoAssault.
4612569	4618170	You go around building stuff and talking with people, it's just a MMO with LEGOs.
4618710	4620591	And it's for kids, but...
4621545	4624026	I love Legos, so I'm probably going to play it just to see what it's like.
4624066	4625026	I love Legos, too.
4625307	4627788	I remember when you tried to make the charging cradle out of Legos.
4628068	4629048	I did make a charging cradle.
4629228	4635231	Speaking of which, I broke the charging cradle this week because Nellie wanted to play Elite Beat Agents because she's been playing that game now.
4635511	4640713	I had to rip the cable out because it doesn't work very well plugged into the DS.
4640753	4645395	For those that didn't hear the shows a while back, Loki actually built a DS charger out of Legos.
4647580	4649086	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4653932	4654913	I like Legos too.
4655433	4656953	Actual Legos.
4657534	4659474	Not so much all these games.
4659534	4660415	I love Legos.
4660475	4665997	I measure my Legos in gallons now, and I still have 10 gallons of Legos in my closet.
4666137	4668558	Let's build the next OLR studio out of Legos.
4668898	4670099	We don't have enough Legos for that.
4670559	4671900	I did one time build something.
4671980	4679963	I used to have this desk that stretched one whole wall on my room, and I used every single Lego to build one giant, like,
4681331	4684934	I heard a rumor you were going to, I don't know if I can say it on air, but
4705231	4709654	Yes, I'm planning on, if I can at all manage it, I'm going to be going to DragonCon.
4710715	4717080	I want to go to be there at the podcaster's panel, just, you know, right now it's like, how am I going to afford that?
4717260	4718361	But, you know, I'm working on it.
4718421	4723965	I played Monopoly pinball and I was actually kicking ass over at Sunnyvale Golf Land yesterday.
4724405	4726747	What the fuck does that have to do with anything DragonCon?
4726767	4728068	She mentioned pinball.
4729864	4741068	I don't know if I told everybody, but we did get a new machine and we got a Bride of Pinbot.
4741329	4745450	Dan has my Rocky and Bullwinkle working now, which makes me intensely happy.
4746230	4747611	And our Guns N' Roses is now for sale.
4748651	4750972	Aw, will you sell it to someone on the internets?
4751172	4752653	Oh, but shipping would be an arm and a leg.
4753177	4757558	If they live in the area or want to come pick it up and pay us a lot of money for it, then I don't think they'll mind.
4757578	4757998	Define a lot.
4758078	4759558	How much are you selling the Guns N' Roses for?
4759598	4759998	I don't know.
4760058	4760638	It's up to Dan.
4762019	4765179	He actually may have a trade worked out on it, but I think we're also selling our Johnny Mnemonic.
4765819	4767540	It's a good pin, but I hate Johnny Mnemonic.
4767600	4768720	You should let us know some prices.
4769540	4777421	Well, I'll talk to the hubby and see if he wants me to use our independent, non-corporate sponsored podcast to sell my pinball machine.
4777461	4777902	Why not?
4777942	4779262	You ought to get something out of this deal.
4779542	4780062	Seriously.
4780424	4782585	All right, well, something else you can do if you love Orange Lounge Radio.
4782605	4784986	We'll give some cheap plugs for some of our other stuff right now.
4785546	4791589	You can always leave us a review on iTunes because we could definitely use some more five-star review on iTunes because it helps spread the word about the program.
4792230	4801234	Also, you can visit our MySpace, www.myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and be our friend on there because who doesn't love having a thousand friends on MySpace?

4866583	4878030	So two channels were Spike TV, which were playing some really crappy Bros vs. Joes or something like that thing, which I don't have any interest in sports TV.
4878431	4881873	But it was funny, though, because all of a sudden it was like Spike TV.
4882333	4887056	Also, last night I was watching G4 TV because they had cheaters on, and that was kind of funny.
4887116	4889237	What else are you going to watch at midnight?
4890958	4891258	I don't know.
4891759	4893700	I guess I could have watched Saturday Night Live, but that's not funny.
4894744	4895565	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4923922	4925703	Why don't you massage your way to DragonCon?

4969641	4970742	Massage is good for your health.
4970922	4973623	Maybe they need, you know, conventions are a lot of walking.
4973663	4974563	You should massage people's feet.
4974583	4979805	I'm actually thinking about, because a lot of my friends are on the Fonamay staff.
4980145	4983186	I'm actually thinking about asking them if I can get an event license for the day.
4983206	4984627	God, Fonamay is right around the corner too.
4985047	4985827	May, end of May.
4986248	4986488	Yeah.
