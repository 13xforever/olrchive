487	5570	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5890	14755	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15455	19137	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20218	22439	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
22519	27722	It is March 18, 2007, and you're on Part B of our podcast series.
27970	28951	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
51215	52675	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
78502	79723	Best Buy, Best Buy, Best Buy
107836	109757	Now, here's an interesting spin on it, though.
110458	114841	Our company, we haven't been able to get 20 gig systems for a while now.
115742	119465	And they are basically have been discontinued in our system as well.
119485	122707	And this has been, I think, going on for about over a month.
123367	129972	So I wouldn't be surprised if this is true, if they're discontinuing the 20 gig system, probably because they're making more money off the 60 gig system.
130493	133435	And not a lot of people were snatching up the 20 gig system.
133835	134215	I don't know.
134235	135917	I think 20 gig was still pretty fine.
135957	136177	I mean...
137119	139540	20 is enough space for right now at least.
140480	141500	So, I don't know.
141660	143861	Not for the Xbox 360 with all that movie stuff.
143901	144841	I'm almost out of space.
145622	147102	So, you know, I don't know.
147142	148322	I think about that with the PlayStation 3.
148362	151963	When I jump ship, I probably will get the 60 gig model just because I'm a consumer whore.
152624	152964	And how?
154944	156865	I will just upgrade my hard drive in there.
158145	159066	Well, here's something cool.
160066	162327	Speaking of, we had talked about Tecmo earlier.
163787	165828	Tecmo is bringing out Ninja Gaiden Sigma and
167777	175142	as a has new backgrounds, enemies, characters, animations, textures completely revamped for the next system.
176483	181287	You can partially or fully install the game on the PS3 to help with load time.
181767	187071	It will run at 60 frames per second, self-shadowing, and in 720p.
187972	190734	So lots of Ninja Gaiden action.
190834	193936	You also get a playable Rachel.
194947	197649	You, uh, apparently supposed to be very bouncy.
198469	200311	Because, you know, it's Team Ninja.
201491	201711	So.
202712	210437	My question is, will I actually be able to get anywhere in the game without getting frustrated so that I throw my controller through the screen?
210477	212358	Nobody can help that you suck at it, Rob.
212518	214400	No, everybody sucks at Ninja Gaiden.
214680	214840	No.
214860	216021	It's a fucking hard game.
216221	217201	Dan was pretty good at it.
218462	220544	Well, Dan is a god among men then, I guess.
220624	221404	I don't know what to tell you.
222165	223466	Well, I only marry awesome.
223846	224146	All right.
225385	228508	Anyhow, a game I'm really looking forward to on the PlayStation 3.
229108	233172	And how sad is it that this is one of the games I'm really looking forward to on the PlayStation 3?
234593	237155	Loki's wagging his finger already because he knows what I'm going to say.
238173	241834	SingStar on the PlayStation 3 is coming out, of course.
242454	250115	A lot of people thought it was going to be something that was like a network download, but no, I think at E3 they said it was going to be a full game.
250496	254436	Well, it is coming on a Blu-ray disc and there's going to be HD videos on it.
255256	256737	30 songs on the disc.
257137	261758	We don't know exactly what 30 songs we're talking about yet, but I seem to remember E3...
264728	266209	Survivor by Destiny's Child
291074	293255	We'll get that on the internet for all our listeners to download.
293735	296957	Or just Bobby Blackwolf because he's Loki's only friend on the PlayStation 3.
297357	297677	I don't know.
298458	299038	No, I'm not.
299478	299938	Oh, that's right.
299958	300218	I'm sorry.
300238	301279	You have like seven friends now.
301299	302099	I'm not his only friend.
302319	302760	Oh, sorry.
303620	304360	He's not my only friend.
304440	305281	You're very popular.
306641	307282	Exactly.
308742	316546	Anyways, something that's kind of popular on the PC is distributed... What is it?
317306	317787	Computing.
318267	320568	They have a similar thing with Folding at Home.
321107	322008	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
342034	343195	Stuff to cure cancer.
343315	353799	So you might have a part in curing diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Cystic Fibrosis, and many cancers.
354640	355040	Stuff like that.
355060	357641	Oh, well, let me write that $600 check right now.
357701	359102	It's for a good cause, right?
360902	361583	Exactly.
362143	364604	You know, I don't know.
365244	366125	It's interesting.
366485	371067	That whole, you know, distributed, I think that that website distributed net had something like that.
371267	371547	Yeah.
372469	374170	It's a very interesting concept.
375190	379272	I don't know, as it is, the PlayStation 3 does suck a lot of power out of it.
379332	383254	I mean, if this was something on the Wii, I could have it in standby and it would do this.
383294	386035	There's Wii Connect 24 for you, huh?
387795	396879	I don't know if I really want my PlayStation 3, this giant screensaver on an HDTV, just sitting there all day long, even if it was for a good cause.
397580	398260	Fuck that shit.
398320	401342	It should be calculating what the winning lotto numbers are for me.
401382	404024	That's the kind of computing I want to see the PlayStation 3 doing.
404965	409727	I wanted to see, you know, it earning money to pay for itself.
409847	410748	That's what it should be doing.
411148	412909	Go out and get a job, PlayStation 3.
413330	414810	Go out and wash some dishes somewhere.
416732	418793	Get a job cooking french fries someplace.
422246	423546	Work the streets if you have to.
423627	424107	I don't care.
424147	425907	Just help me pay the rent, PlayStation 3.
425967	427047	Pimp that Blu-ray.
427768	428448	$600, make you holler.
430809	431149	Anyway.
431669	432769	Yeah, make you holler.
432809	438051	Why did I spend $600 on this goddamn Blu-ray player?
438351	438691	Anyway.
440952	448894	In other news regarding the player itself, the 1.6 firmware update for PS3 has a remote play function, so you can...
450509	457932	Bring up any audio, video, photo stored on the PS3 using your PSP.
459332	461893	Actually, just anywhere you can find an internet connection.
462494	463314	So that's kind of cool.
463954	467335	Porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn.
467415	469916	Mighty porn, mighty porn, porn, porn.
469956	470197	Okay.
472878	479400	Sorry, anytime you talk about sharing photos and movies and all that stuff, I can't help but think of porn.
481809	482729	Is that so wrong?
485851	490532	I also can't help but think of Killzone on the PlayStation 3 coming out in July.
490692	492533	Actually, there's a lot of other things I can think of.
492593	493733	I just needed to transition.
496154	496354	What?
497015	497935	Oh, go ahead.
497955	506318	Well, anyway, Phil Harrison revealed some footage of Killzone on the PlayStation 3, of course, at Game Developers Conference.
506778	508539	And, you know, it was...
509997	521041	I guess one of those things where the feedback from the journalists was not so hot, so they didn't end up showing it at the full Sony conference, even though folks were reporting they could see it on the screen, like in the PS3, they didn't play it.
521502	522382	It was a tease thing.
523943	529725	But according to IGN, the game will, I guess, come out in July.
530325	533106	It's not coming out in July, the demo will come out in July.
534447	534827	Interesting.
534987	537028	Yeah, the game itself is nowhere near done.
537907	541750	But we'll probably see it at E3 or something like that.
543192	543612	Interesting.
544152	551659	Another game that we can be looking forward to pretty soon, well, a few months off at least, but Grand Theft Auto 4.
552339	557664	And it is thought, the rumor is that it's going to be set in a New York City setting.
558444	564970	And this rumor comes from a couple of people that have been
565994	594380	um contracted to come up with New York City themed music for the game so um you know possibly hinting that a New York City type theme if I were to guess I would say it's Liberty City because that's supposed to be New York City anyways so I don't know I would think Liberty City all over again is where it's going to be but whatever they could surprise us and have a real you know city in there either way it's um
595574	603399	The game's not expected out until October, however, the first ever trailer of the game will be available March 29th.
604160	605761	And I cannot wait.
607202	608423	And it better not suck.
609483	613966	Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the previous Grand Theft Auto game you could fly planes at some point, right?
614487	614707	Yes.
614927	622872	Okay, now, isn't putting the thing in New York City, look, I'm trying not to be wrong here, but just, you know, thinking aloud here.
623635	634042	By putting Grand Theft Auto in a town very similar to New York City, doesn't that kind of open it up for folks at home to do some really unpolitically correct things in their game?
634823	635943	Y'all know what I'm talking about.
635983	639866	I don't have to say it, but you know kids across America are going to try to imitate it.
640236	645977	You know, you can already, to be honest, you can't fly 747s or whatever.
646277	647778	You can't fly giant jet planes.
647798	653959	You can fly biplanes and stuff like that into, you know, towers or make, you know, jets and stuff like that.
654299	657780	Hell, if you want to do that now, go buy San Andreas because you can do that right now.
658480	663121	San Andreas was funny because you'd be driving along on a motorcycle and then all of a sudden a plane would crash into you.
663201	666182	So random plane crashes are kind of fun in that game too.
667248	668469	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
689622	694066	Tack Johnson is going to have his ego all over this crap with another lawsuit.
694186	694786	Let me put it this way.
694846	703013	If I can have Sex with the Hooker in a jet flying towards a building and then set a nuclear explosion off that wipes out the entire city, that would be awesome.
704854	707897	Everybody seems to agree here that it's going to take place in future.
709278	710879	A, it's not really New York City.
710999	719286	B, even if it was modeled after New York City a lot, it would be a future New York City where that landmark I was previously referring to would be removed.
719761	721202	But, still.
723084	723784	You know, I don't know.
723864	729288	I can't help but think, you know, if they might put something in there where folks would be able to make it look like that.
729328	732171	All that would happen is you crash into the building and your plane explodes.
732551	735613	The building does not explode or fall apart.
736154	737455	That's all that would happen.
737935	740237	Is your plane would explode and people would be like, Ha!
740337	740857	It's like 9-11!
741197	744700	And then you would, you know, get it out of your system and you'd go back to playing the damn game.
745120	749484	Or you'd be like me and do it a few more times until you got it out of your system and then... But can you not see...
750117	761020	Tack Johnson in a courtroom playing this footage telling the judge how Rockstar is evil and they're Al-Qaeda sympathizers and the game should be banned from the market forever.
761140	761860	No, no, no.
761960	762700	Hold on, hold on.
762780	765401	You're expecting him to actually show footage of the game.
765441	772503	I mean, he's trying to sue them now about games that haven't even come out yet that he doesn't know anything about other than that they are making a game.
773003	773703	He's an idiot.
774023	774644	Okay, that's it.
774684	775664	We're not talking about it anymore.
775744	775964	Done.
777284	778665	He Who Shall Not Be Named
801107	806588	We should send him one of the pink PS2s that are out in Australia on the 15th.
806748	811669	Do you mean over at... I had to censor myself.
811809	813589	Is that what you mean, my arch-nemesis?
814410	817470	No, I was actually... Well, he's not necessarily an arch-nemesis.
817510	819110	He's more like a lackey.
819511	820411	Okay, anyway, sorry.
820451	822351	He would be like Toad is to Magneto.
822791	823351	Okay.
823871	827152	No, I was referring to He Who Shall Not Be Named.
828482	829203	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
857719	868346	Anyways, I swear to God, I am sick and tired of hearing about Warhawk and whether it's going to be on a fucking disc or downloadable title.
869047	876552	Anyways, because of that, during Game Developers Conference, because this is back when they said, okay, downloadable only title, great.
877312	879233	Apparently, some people are a little bit pissed off.
879814	886618	A few people left the actual development team because, you know, they were frustrated like this and basically saying, you know, crap product will sell like crap.
888573	890535	If it's on the shelf or not.
890735	892356	So that's kind of my take on this thing.
892657	894819	The game looked okay, but you know what?
895039	901224	I couldn't give a shit about whether it's on a disc, it's on the PlayStation Network, or both.
902245	907270	Just release the damn game, because I swear to God, the longer it takes this game to come out, the worse it seems to get.
907410	909031	So, that is it.
910032	910873	I'm done with Warhawk.
912845	918166	I will never read another story about the game coming out on disc or on the network.
918506	919186	Or at all.
921066	924047	You know, why are we bothered putting together an outline if you're just going to skip my stories?
926347	926667	Whatever.
928268	928908	No, it's fine.
930168	931648	Didn't we talk about it last week anyway?
931968	932728	Yeah.
933208	934889	PlayStation 3 is getting episodic games.
934929	935409	Who cares?
935889	938589	Because I remember us having a conversation about this last week.
938909	941910	Who has put together successfully an episodic franchise
942412	943593	Except for Sam and Max.
943833	947516	It's like the only one I can think of in the past little while that's been successful.
948097	949398	I don't care about episodic games.
949438	950919	You know why they're doing episodic games?
951059	954882	It's because they go, cha-ching, cha-ching, oh, I can make some more money off this shit.
954962	955302	Yeah.
955923	958405	Great, let's put some more episodic content out there.
958945	961667	Because the last stuff's done so well so far.
962268	965630	Flaming Bozo in chat room says, Grand Theft Auto 4 is going episodic.
966631	969033	Has added content, but it has a full game before it.
969794	969974	Hmm.
970947	972788	DarkSakura will put some hand sanitizing rubber gloves on
999494	1005496	Dive into the mailbag and pull out her favorite emails and her least favorite emails to read here on the air.
1005576	1007656	So you can't send average emails because they don't get read.
1007937	1008137	No.
1008757	1013178	We try to read as many as we can, but since, you know, we're so popular and all.
1014198	1014519	Yeah, right.
1015279	1017119	No, but sometimes we just get too many.
1017339	1018920	We can't read them here on the program.
1019200	1020320	But DarkSakura does read them all.
1020920	1021441	Sometimes.
1021641	1023401	I read most of them, too, actually.
1023741	1029143	So unless you're a spammer, then do not actually send us email because we're banning IPs.
1030336	1031518	Let's open up the mailbag, shall we?
1036264	1039248	Well, we have three.
1040350	1044316	Dear LLR, I recently got a new gaming machine and thought I'd send in a review.
1044716	1046679	A couple weeks ago, I bought myself a shiny Commodore 128.
1048228	1059343	I've been wanting to play a 64 for some time largely due to the opinions expressed on your fine show, but eventually the used market prices dropped on the 128 model and I decided that it was worth a dollar to get a newer machine.
1059544	1060425	I'm sure glad I did.
1061547	1061927	What, Rob?
1064406	1066047	I love whoever wrote this already.
1066247	1066708	Finish it.
1066808	1067889	Just read the whole thing.
1067929	1068949	This is beautiful.
1068969	1075194	So having lesser system specs, the C128 still holds up well feature-wise against other consoles on the market.
1075234	1084520	It offers backwards compatibility just like each of the major consoles on the market and even supports homebrew just like modified PSPs do, which so far only Microsoft seems to be interested in with their consoles.
1084580	1091886	The C128 offers more buttons than any current console and it is available in a stylish off-put color similar to the DS Lite, Xbox 360, and
1092706	1094347	and Wii, although somewhat less glossy.
1094948	1098370	Unfortunately, it still lacks some of the features of the other consoles.
1098390	1106315	The 128 does not currently support HD output, but it is not believed that Commodore will be addressing that problem through firmware or otherwise.
1106815	1120144	The command mode basic interpreter is also a little bit more difficult to use than, say, channels on the Wii, where everything is laid out for you and you just point at what you want instead of typing load, quote, asterisk, quote, uh,
1120825	1125933	Comma 8 and cursing whenever you hit the wrong key or the file list is longer than one screen.
1126373	1128276	I remember that for freaking Lode Runner.
1129747	1141779	Of course, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and while there are very few C128 games, backwards compatibility means that I can enjoy any C64 game I can get my hands on, of which there are many.
1142200	1150248	And if you know the discs haven't disintegrated over the last two decades, which I understand is a problem, I cannot seem to get Impossible Mission or The Last Ninja to work.
1150668	1153091	I even tried blowing into them, but no such luck.
1153735	1160078	Overall, however, I find the Commodore 128 to be a fine addition to my game console lineup, and I intend to have many more hours of fun with it.
1160258	1161679	By right sucks, Warrior Bob.
1163219	1166381	Seriously, Warrior Bob, I want to have your baby.
1166581	1167801	That was an awesome email.
1169162	1175125	Imagine, we could have a little house full of little VIC-20s and Plus 4s and 16s running around everywhere.
1176125	1176985	That email was beautiful.
1177126	1178726	Oh, he also sends another email to you.
1179146	1179487	Oh, really?
1179727	1180467	You're a rock star.
1181508	1182488	Oh, we're so going to get it on.
1183413	1184433	with our Commodore.
1185154	1195738	We should do some Commodore live gaming and we could play... God, what the hell could you play over the modem on the Commodore 64 on my 300 baud modem that plugged into the back of the Commodore 64?
1196298	1197619	What kind of games could I play?
1197979	1199940	I guess over the local bulletin board systems.
1200480	1204001	God, no, not even... Even then, I didn't really hit until I had an IBM.
1204362	1206622	Was there anything you could play over the modem on the Commodore 64?
1207343	1208723	Surely we had a modem for some reason.
1208803	1210224	I'd play a whole shitload of kicks.
1211075	1211655	Maybe there was.
1211875	1212616	Kix was my game.
1212836	1214137	We'll get together and play some Kix.
1214297	1218619	The last email comes from... Wait, you said three emails.
1218799	1220259	I know the second one was also from Warrior Bob.
1220480	1220580	Oh.
1221960	1223321	This one's from Philly Girl.
1223861	1224702	Hi, Orange Lounge.
1224742	1227183	I think you are the best podcast ever.
1227563	1230885	You don't know how much I appreciate you guys, but onto what I'm emailing you.
1230945	1232125	I've got a dirty joke for you.
1233726	1237848	What's six to eight inches long, goes in and out of your mouth, and leaves the white stuff around your lips?
1238148	1238368	A penis.
1238388	1238648	A toothbrush.
1239189	1239749	A toothbrush.
1241004	1241244	P.S.
1241304	1243806	I've already signed up on your website because you guys are so great.
1243866	1245848	My screen name is VanityAngel from DDR.
1246148	1247149	Thanks for putting this on the show.
1252514	1254636	The email had nothing to do with video games.
1254656	1257218	Somebody just emailed us going, hey, I want to tell you a dirty joke.
1257598	1257938	Pretty much.
1259039	1260361	God, I love our listeners.
1261742	1263123	In fact, that's even better.
1263463	1267326	What you need to do is call our Skype line or our...
1268353	1268813	1-877-GAME-OLR
1297091	1326342	UK sorry you guys are screwed you gotta you're Australia you guys gotta use the regular Skype method of doing it Orange Lounge Radio on Skype that's a beautiful idea if they're video game jokes that's even better I would love to hear some really more points if it's video game themed like Dirty Princess Peach jokes that would be great this is also great and it has nothing to do with porn or emails or any of that wow there really wasn't that many emails this week that's kind of sad I cry yeah aww
1327065	1329267	Mailbag at orangeonstrider.com Send us more stuff.
1330167	1331008	This is great.
1331828	1332489	Great, great news.
1333089	1338753	Vivendi is looking to actually revive Sierra.
1339073	1346918	Oh, this is great news because Vivendi, you know, years ago, they bought out Sierra or whatever and they're offshoot Sierra online.
1347539	1353523	And now it looks like Vivendi is going to be reviving Sierra somewhat.
1354093	1355214	The Vendy CEO Bruce Hack
1376191	1378592	The revival of the Sierra brand comes from product.
1379132	1385314	Over time, as our products become better and establish themselves as perennial franchises, the name Sierra will be given a stronger life.
1385734	1391655	As we move forward, our products get stronger, and as they are established as franchises, the name Sierra will be strengthened.
1393156	1395937	No news yet, though, on a new Police Quest game, which kind of makes me sad.
1396017	1396937	Or Leisure Suit Larry.
1397137	1400918	Well, I guess, then again, Leisure Suit Larry went somewhere else, right?
1401331	1402772	He went to a dirty, dirty place.
1426994	1427534	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1457663	1484481	Sam and Max and it will be available in August of 2007 comments in the chat room on the last story sorry to deviate a little bit but some interesting things on Sierra James Patrick in chat says please Sierra is dead Sierra Studios were in the Sierra Mountains that studio is closed therefore Sierra the real Sierra is dead and the adventure company is the one bringing it over here to the United States so
1486070	1488451	I love Sam & Max, and I don't know why I haven't played it yet.
1490012	1494875	By the way, Sierra and Sam & Max have nothing to do with each other, but I was... Well, the chat room's a little bit behind.
1494915	1496796	There's a little bit of live lag, so there you have it.
1501158	1503259	Sorry, I had a complete and utter brain fart.
1503700	1503900	Why?
1503940	1504340	What happened?
1504360	1505721	Were you daydreaming during the show?
1505801	1506401	Is that what's going on?
1506541	1511504	No, I did my Reiki class today, so I've been sort of out of it.
1512160	1516623	Maybe me and Captain America can run off and have a family together.
1518124	1524188	I'll pursue my massage therapy and he can have a successful business as a crime fighter.
1525289	1528031	What the fuck?
1528051	1528931	Okay, so how about a story?
1528952	1530312	I'd like to see that in a comic.
1530793	1531473	How about a story?
1532514	1535476	No, how about more Jamie and Captain America slash fanfic?
1540965	1542806	We'll name our family the Avengers.
1542947	1546389	That's the custom license plate we'll have on our minivan.
1546929	1550652	Can I please see this posted on fanfic.net or whatever that site is?
1550932	1561780	No, because anyone who writes any fanfiction at all involving any characterization of me will be sued for libel or something.
1561820	1562701	No sense of humor.
1562921	1564562	No, I have no sense of humor because it was stupid.
1564802	1568065	Then make a character named Sark Dakara.
1570053	1570913	I can see it now.
1570973	1575397	They're barbecuing on a Weber grill that's painted to look like the Captain America shield.
1576578	1576839	Yeah.
1577299	1579081	That was stupid.
1579821	1584485	So how about the next... Hey, you're the one that had a brain fart and derailed the show.
1587188	1587768	Shut up.
1588108	1588909	No pie for you.
1588989	1589870	I was going to get you pie.
1590911	1591651	Anyway, story.
1592812	1593293	Well, um...
1594958	1608564	For anyone who likes their MMOs, Turbine is offering the former subscribers of the Dungeons & Dragons online game a free weekend of gaming, actually, which is over right now.
1610005	1614727	But for those in Europe, you're going to get an additional bonus for 10 days.
1616608	1617808	of Free Gaming.
1618368	1622489	So you can enjoy their Module 3.3.
1623810	1626670	It's supposed to beef up their character stuff.
1628050	1640653	Also, for those who are currently subscribed, you will get 50% more experience and a plus one to loot found and lots of live events.
1640693	1643094	So basically they're saying, we don't want to go out of business.
1644214	1644874	So there you go.
1647133	1672477	Alrighty, well, changing gears completely here, talking about, well, maybe, I don't know, maybe they'll show D&D online at this, who knows, but of course, the E for All Expo is being held October 18th through the 21st at the LA Convention Center, which is where E3 used to be, and of course, E for All is supposed to be kind of like that public version of E3, but we're not sure exactly how much like E3 it's going to be, because part of us are
1673342	1674983	Nintendo and Sony were traditionally in the West Hall.
1700600	1707125	So therefore, we know that Sony and Nintendo's boost will be a little bit smaller than what we know from E3 past.
1707165	1713711	But still, the fact that they are going really gives a boost, I think, in some regards to the E for All Expo.
1714231	1718435	If you want to go, hey, it's only $100, but the tickets are not currently on sale.
1718835	1721017	They will be made available in the future, I guess.
1722178	1726701	But certainly, Sony and Nintendo signing on does really help out this new show.
1727022	1727762	So we'll see what happens.
1728523	1729724	Will they be using Kensha Hall?
1730060	1730620	That would be fun.
1731681	1734822	I'll probably have a gun show going on in Kenshiya Hall while this is going on.
1735282	1735962	No, seriously.
1737422	1740243	One time... No, for real.
1740463	1748006	One year I went to the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention in Las Vegas, which is at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
1748066	1753267	We had the right side of the building for the costume contest, the live speakers, because they had people from the movie there and everything.
1753548	1756208	And then the left side was a gun show.
1757369	1757909	So you had
1758683	1773970	People in fishnets and full, you know, doctor, for those that have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about, like full Dr. Frankenfurter garb and, you know, little Columbia's and sequined outfits and, you know, people just basically dressed like fucking freaks intermingling with the gun show people.
1774010	1779353	And the most hilarious part was that the ATM was in the gun show room.
1780213	1788017	So if any rocky people wanted money to buy their crap, they had to actually go into the gun show and get pointed at and stared at by the folks there.
1789414	1791895	Guns Next To Games Just What He Who Shall Not Be Named Once
1817566	1829567	Anyway, so there's a brand new game coming out now that's probably one of those serious games that will help kids deal with the complex emotions surrounding marriage or divorce in this case.
1830919	1831880	Earthquake and Zipland
1860928	1861608	There you go.
1862288	1863589	No way you can fix a marriage.
1863889	1866630	You might as well throw yourself into the ocean and die.
1867330	1868430	Oh, does the game tell you that, too?
1868470	1869570	That's really pleasant.
1869690	1872091	No, but that's where I took from it.
1872171	1873331	I could be wrong, but, you know.
1873511	1874492	Oh, okay.
1874632	1876992	But then again, I'm not a 12-year-old that's played this game.
1878853	1879773	I'm neither of those.
1881073	1884294	DarkSakura, do you think we need a game to help kids understand divorce?
1887075	1888175	No, people just shouldn't get married.
1888595	1889696	They should have an expo.
1889716	1890696	Seriously, think about it.
1891255	1903750	If there was no marriage, none at all, and everybody had a common law deal, then there wouldn't be a problem.
1905211	1909156	Oh, well, Daddy decided that he and Mommy were going to break up, so he just moved out.
1910657	1911078	No problems.
1912725	1918151	They should find out that the reason that the island split in two is because the king was having sex with some other chick.
1918192	1919873	Daddy's moving in with Uncle Bob.
1923998	1930506	I personally, I basically, my parents were divorced before I had any memory of them being married.
1931187	1931427	So...
1935241	1940586	From that point of view, I couldn't really say if a game would help with that, because I just always grew up understanding what divorce was.
1940846	1943588	Seriously, my parents have been together ever since I was born.
1943608	1951594	They were together for like 15 years before I was born, and they're still together today, and I need a game to help me understand why they're still together after all these years.
1952015	1959341	What I don't get is why people who obviously hate each other's fucking guts, Oh, we're staying together for the kids.
1959421	1962303	Meanwhile, you're giving them a fucking complex because you hate each other.
1963211	1964952	Why does Mommy and Daddy fight?
1965012	1966192	Why do they hate each other?
1967433	1969654	You'd all be happier if you'd just go ahead and get a divorce.
1970014	1971975	Well, I'm sure we'll be getting some emails on that one.
1972015	1973395	Mailbag.
1973676	1975416	I don't believe in staying together for the children.
1975516	1978618	I believe in giving the children a healthier environment to exist in.
1979278	1979618	All right.
1980118	1982359	Well, we'll see what kind of Pandora's box that comment opens.
1982439	1985801	I grew up just fine with my divorced parents, okay?
1986401	1986661	All right.
1986701	1987322	We'll see what happens.
1987762	1988022	All right.
1988042	1988282	Anyway.
1988655	1990575	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2015856	2017556	You're not giving it the proper context.
2017656	2022598	You heard about it from me on a radio program a couple years ago.
2022998	2024098	Just play me my damn music.
2024978	2025858	I'm going to go run and hide.
2033100	2038501	The website of the week, again, is one that Rob mentioned a long time ago.
2041702	2042942	Mantis.net Mantis.net
2045885	2046205	Sorry.
2046686	2049828	Mantis are panties made for men.
2051290	2052691	And they're frilly and lacy.
2053291	2054753	And you can get them high cut.
2055333	2056314	You can get briefs.
2056654	2061659	And you can get nylon or lace.
2062700	2064381	And they have all kinds of designs.
2064461	2065962	And they have seven day ones.
2066603	2068104	And they're really pretty.
2068204	2072228	And plus they're made spacious in the front for special needs of men.
2073349	2073529	So...
2075175	2094191	Guys, if you want to be pretty, if you feel like being a little dressier than usual, you should go to mantis.net Chat room, the answer to your question is no.
2096473	2097253	That would be no.
2099295	2100997	That's so wrong.
2102678	2103419	I feel dirty.
2106912	2111775	But you can still feel dirty, yet pretty underneath, and no one knows but you.
2113936	2114856	It's a great idea.
2116077	2120179	Like, I'm looking at the embroidered ones, and they have hearts on them or balloons.
2120219	2124421	Hey, PowerShop Pinball Constructors coming out for the Nintendo DS.
2125002	2128163	Oxygen Games just announced this coming out very soon.
2129912	2146441	You know, cause Metroid Prime Pinball did pretty well, so here we go, Pinball, Powershot Pinball Constructor So I guess it sounds like you can make your own table in this game, which sounds kinda cool, yeah, it has a table editor in it And of course that makes me think of Pinball Construction Set on the Commodore 64 Pinball's fucking awesome!
2146841	2155466	So now you can make your own table, so that means if I wanted to make a table of nothing but like 50 bumpers, I could do that Do you remember the Hyperball machine though?
2156106	2157667	All it was was nothing but multiball
2158411	2159011	Oh, I don't remember that.
2159031	2161272	It would just shoot out a bunch of balls and you'd have to shoot them back down on the thing.
2161812	2166174	But, you know, if I want to build pinball machines, I just get Dan to buy one and fix it for me.
2168015	2172336	All right, well, now you can do it all in the palm of your hand on the DS.
2172456	2172837	There you go.
2173977	2183981	Anyway, so Zelda co-creator Eiji Aonuma, I guess, Aonuma, confirmed in an interview with Game Informer
2184520	2192045	Phantom Hourglass for the DS will feature in online multiplayer mode.
2192945	2202051	And they didn't really say what it's going to feature, but he did answer yes when they asked if there's going to be online battles over the Nintendo Wi-Fi service.
2202411	2205473	So that's interesting, I guess.
2206034	2208635	Maybe, I'm thinking it's going to be something like Four Swords, maybe?
2209596	2210196	That'd be kind of neat.
2210216	2211577	I don't know.
2212078	2212758	That'd be pretty cool.
2214526	2216427	4 Swords was actually a really, really cool game.
2216447	2220168	4 Swords was a much fun game, like on the GameCube.
2220188	2221188	That game was awesome.
2221308	2227209	When you could find people that had the advances and the chords to play the damn game with, it was a fun game.
2227389	2234111	I thought I heard... Now, I can't remember... Correct me if I'm wrong, because I never played 4 Swords Adventure or something like that.
2234271	2236552	Did it have an online mode or something where someone...
2237341	2240162	There's like a couple Triforces on the map or something like that.
2240742	2246705	I think we talked about this maybe last week, where you basically drew a path that this warrior thing follows or something.
2246725	2250946	That's the multiplayer in the Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
2251206	2251607	Oh, okay.
2251907	2252147	Yeah.
2252947	2256328	I think that was Bobby telling us about him playing it at GDC.
2256448	2257129	That's right.
2257189	2257869	That's what he was saying.
2257889	2259229	That's what we were hanging out with him last week.
2259470	2263091	Yeah, anyways, so as Bobby was telling us from GDC, it's basically...
2263715	2273359	There's a couple Triforces on the map, and you can't, I think, see the player if they have a Triforce or don't have a Triforce, something like that.
2273779	2280622	And basically, one player controls, there's three guards, and you draw a path that they follow, and stuff like that.
2280662	2281702	So it sounds interesting.
2281722	2287005	It's kind of like that Pac-Man multiplayer game that was on the GameCube.
2287025	2290406	Pac-Man Versus, which they so need on the Wii and online.
2291607	2296588	or on Xbox Live then, because if Nintendo's not going to do it, then fucking put Pac-Man vs. on Xbox Live.
2297309	2300389	That's what we should have gotten instead of old school Pac-Man, but that's just my opinion.
2300850	2301050	Yeah.
2301810	2302350	What do I know?
2304450	2304991	I don't know, Rob.
2305011	2305751	What do you know?
2306511	2307331	How about some stuff?
2308352	2308912	I know stuff.
2309112	2311392	There is a little bit of information, though.
2311552	2313573	I know I'm not visiting your website of the week this week.
2316754	2316954	Rob.
2317294	2317454	Yeah?
2319483	2327008	So there is an unholy union between In The Groove and Pump It Up.
2327788	2331630	It's like they got together after taking a lot of LSD and bread.
2332711	2335273	So now there's a Pump It Up Pro.
2337634	2337994	Yeah.
2338555	2339775	I'm not going to say anything else about that.
2341076	2341997	God, where do I begin?
2342017	2342037	A.
2343211	2349117	Those of you that were saying that In The Groove was going to somehow be absorbed into Konami and Dance Dance Revolution No!
2349197	2351199	It was going to have In The Groove songs, no.
2352240	2356484	And here's further proof that that ain't happening because it's been absorbed into Pump It Up, it looks like.
2356544	2361129	It's pretty much all the songs that were done by Kyle Warder now on Pump It Up, that's about it.
2361696	2365179	So, in other words, Andamiro threw a bunch of money at Kyle Ward, and that's it?
2365219	2370043	Because Andamiro... But Andamiro and Roxor had, I guess, a working relationship, right?
2370063	2375627	Because those In The Groove 2 cabinets, of which I've still never seen one in my entire life, were... Well, wait.
2375847	2376508	I take that back.
2376708	2380832	There might have been one at that 8 on the Break place in Jersey when I went there a long time ago.
2380872	2381332	I can't remember.
2381392	2384575	But regardless, Andamiro made those cabinets for him, right?
2385375	2385615	Yeah.
2386216	2386676	I think so.
2386956	2387257	So...
2388115	2390257	They already had a little bit of a working relationship.
2390717	2392598	So this actually doesn't surprise me so much.
2392979	2402265	Yeah, you're going to see songs like, for example, Oasis, as well as... There's a bunch of other stuff I recognized on there when I was watching the videos of them.
2404026	2410671	Exotica, Esperanza, let's see here, Destiny.
2411311	2414854	It was a bunch of songs, I think, from In The Groove that were in there, so...
2415482	2417804	Don't get me wrong, I like some of Kyle Ward's songs.
2417964	2421487	I really like the stuff he does under, was it Banzai is the name?
2421827	2424949	The Zodiac and Anubis and all those songs.
2425009	2426210	But still, I don't know.
2426290	2429653	It's just weird.
2430213	2432395	Miklatov wanted to come on the show tonight, but he had to leave.
2432415	2434697	I know he's a hardcore Pump It Up fan.
2434977	2436258	He ain't happy about this.
2436298	2440982	He does not like the In The Groove thing crossing over to Pump It Up.
2441002	2442543	I don't think it's really crossing over.
2442563	2445065	I think it's more of just they have him now as an artist.
2445293	2445713	That's it.
2446313	2447633	So he's taking his songs with him.
2447673	2451394	I mean, the guy's got to work, so whatever.
2451434	2454815	That doesn't necessarily mean he's just, you know, it's in the groove now.
2455235	2458435	They did, I like what they've done with the interface.
2458515	2461376	The interface is not retarded as it usually is on Pump.
2461856	2462816	So that's kind of nice.
2462916	2466997	But other than that, I don't really think it's in the groove.
2467057	2470878	It's just that it's got, you know, Kyle Ward doing music for him.
2472698	2472918	Great.
2473837	2474498	In the group, DDR, right.
2474518	2474799	All righty.
2486055	2493560	Let's see, if you would like to call us, we're going to open up the Skype line here very shortly because we encourage your interaction here on this program as well.
2493600	2501606	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and our 800 number if you want to call us that way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2501686	2504048	Looks like we have some Ain't On The Break fans or folks that live near there.
2504128	2506009	Blaze says, Ain't On The Break for the win.
2506449	2508291	DDR Dollar Bill says, yeah, Ain't On The Break.
2509311	2511353	Rama says, Sky, that was a beta in the Groove 2.
2511413	2514055	Chinatown Fair has in the Groove 2 and a Pump It Up box.
2515109	2516709	I've been to Ant on the Break.
2518090	2519830	I want to say I've been there a couple times, actually.
2519870	2522711	I think I went out there once randomly when I was in the East Coast.
2522851	2524851	I went there again for some DDR tournament.
2525871	2532252	And I played some game that was some beat game I'd never seen in my life.
2532292	2533133	I don't remember, sorry.
2534353	2534853	Let's see.
2536193	2537514	ShadowCharlie wants to know what happened.
2537554	2542214	Speaking of Zodiac, what happened to the Zodiac remix that Loki made that was during the bonus segment of last week's show?
2542495	2544015	Check his community page on all games.
2544355	2544675	It's there.
2545752	2548593	and apparently 8 on the Break has two in the group, two machines now.
2548633	2549134	There you have it.
2549714	2553876	All right, let's go ahead and head on over to the Skype line and start taking some calls.
2554676	2555937	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2555977	2556377	Who's this?
2557337	2558678	Raven Stolfen.
2558758	2559898	Let me turn down the thing.
2560318	2560619	All right.
2560659	2561499	Hi, Raven Stolfen.
2561519	2562179	What's on your mind?
2563220	2564400	I got a podcast now.
2564760	2566341	You have a podcast now?
2567542	2568342	Mm-hmm.
2568482	2568922	Oh, God.
2568982	2571523	Everybody and their fucking mom has a podcast now.
2571603	2572744	Why should we listen to yours?
2573763	2575784	Because he's a tech podcast guy.
2576165	2576725	Something different.
2577025	2578526	A tech podcast.
2578966	2580628	This week in Raven's Dolphin?
2582189	2582569	Sort of.
2582889	2583489	What's it called?
2584910	2586331	It's called Raven's Tech Review.
2586532	2586792	All right.
2586872	2589153	And where can we access Raven's Tech Review?
2590194	2591175	On the All Games Forum.
2591575	2593276	And it's being submitted to iTunes soon.
2593796	2594517	It's going to be up there.
2594817	2595077	All right.
2595097	2595397	We'll see.
2595417	2597539	Hopefully coming soon to the iTunes store.
2597979	2599300	Well, Raven, talk games with us.
2599320	2602182	Because we don't... Well, I mean, we do talk tech, but we talk video games.
2602222	2603723	What did you think of some of our stories tonight?
2604679	2608602	I think they're interesting, but you're missing one more, and I viewed it on my site.
2608682	2609062	I'm sorry.
2609743	2612144	It's the Commodore computer coming back.
2612985	2615347	We talked about it last week.
2615367	2618028	Yeah, we did.
2618309	2620250	Yeah, that's all right.
2620931	2627835	As a tech-inclined individual, what do you think of Commodore making a comeback in the competing with Alienware or something market?
2628956	2629897	I think it's interesting.
2631394	2633536	I don't know if it's going to be an operating system.
2633596	2636940	Like, you remember the Commodore had a different operating system than the DOS.
2637540	2637801	Right.
2637841	2639362	So I don't know what they're going to do.
2639482	2646530	I don't know if it's going to be Commodore just placed in there with a Windows operating system, or they're going to go with something different.
2647891	2654718	Something tells me, since Commodore Basic is very antiquated, I think you're going to just get a normal Windows PC in there.
2657107	2658568	I was just interesting about that.
2658688	2664572	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to miss syntax error one bit or load, quote, star, quote, comma, eight, comma, one.
2664692	2665753	I ain't going to miss that shit.
2667574	2669955	I don't miss it at all, but two more things.
2669995	2672197	The fuck did comma, eight, comma, one mean anyway?
2673258	2673778	I have no idea.
2673798	2674298	Two more things.
2674318	2676600	It was just their command line.
2676680	2678581	I think it was like the device number or something.
2678621	2680122	Well, why was the disk drive eight?
2680222	2681123	It was always eight.
2681243	2683485	I think like once in a blue moon you might have seven.
2684385	2685546	But anyway, sorry.
2687942	2690244	This would be This Week in Raven from 1984.
2690905	2692606	Sorry, what else?
2692626	2693667	No, you have to listen to it.
2693687	2694968	All right, what else is on your mind, Raven?
2695668	2696809	Two more things on my mind.
2696909	2698190	Vampire for the Commodore 64.
2698450	2701192	You ever play Vampire?
2702393	2705095	I'm familiar with the title, but I can't remember the gameplay.
2705856	2706356	Fun game.
2707017	2707677	It's on GameTap.
2707978	2709218	I was going to say, I think it's on GameTap.
2709238	2709959	I think that's where I've seen it.
2710019	2710700	I have not played it.
2712021	2712341	Okay.
2712361	2713362	What do you do in Vampire?
2713382	2713842	Last thing.
2714778	2716098	And don't say you're a vampire.
2716958	2717959	I am not a vampire.
2718119	2719039	No, I meant in the game.
2720199	2721519	This one goes to DarkSakura.
2722320	2722820	What?
2723860	2725100	Flintstones Pinball.
2725300	2725980	You ever heard of it?
2727441	2728121	I think so.
2728141	2729461	I don't think I was very interested in it.
2729801	2731121	Was it based off the movie?
2731542	2732202	Yeah, it was.
2732402	2739903	I played that table once, and because it was the movie, it felt like I felt unclean after playing it.
2741364	2742804	And I had to go change out of my mantis.
2746311	2748672	Alright, bye Raven's Dolphin, take care.
2750693	2757717	Alright, if you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can always call us on the Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio.
2758557	2761058	Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.
2761699	2763319	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
2765140	2769802	I'll give you three guesses and the first letters are J-A-N-S.
2770483	2771463	Oh, it's Jazz.
2771703	2773604	God, you haven't been on the show in a long time.
2773684	2775045	No, hi Jason, what's on your mind?
2775745	2777786	You fail at spelling, Rob.
2777907	2778507	Jeez.
2779247	2783110	Mr. VXJasonXV himself, our webmaster extraordinaire.
2784831	2786112	Extraordinarily extraordinary.
2786272	2795799	Hey, VX, our website held up amongst being on the front page of Dig and Joystick and Kotaku and all that stuff, Destructoid and all that this week.
2796199	2796940	So, good job.
2797400	2798260	Really good to know.
2798741	2800442	I've kept looking and I've kept checking.
2800482	2801183	I saw when you guys...
2802270	2802990	Rumor noise up, Sal.
2803010	2804550	I would love a new Space Quest game.
2804610	2805391	I would absolutely love it.
2805411	2805891	I don't know.
2805931	2806251	Haven't kept up.
2806271	2809431	I just heard it, and I thought it was cool.
2809451	2809911	Six.
2830109	2832941	Wow, so there were that many games in the Space Quest series?
2832982	2835050	I always thought there was only like the three or four that were in it.
2835111	2835311	Wow.
2836808	2846612	There was, the first four were all the keyboard navigational, the fifth actually introduced the mouse, and then the sixth actually introduced the announcer, and even more interactivity.
2846912	2848773	Five was awesome, that's the first one I played.
2849193	2857477	I got the anthology and played the old ones, and then I played six, and I was blown away, because it was a big difference, and it was so good.
2858257	2859478	For the kids today...
2865396	2867577	What makes this game so freaking great?
2869057	2869377	Humor.
2870678	2872218	You have to read, but it's all in the humor.
2872918	2874399	And it's a great puzzle game.
2875379	2875699	All right.
2878280	2878940	Let's see.
2878960	2879200	Yeah?
2881281	2883021	I was just saying, I mean, that's the best part about it.
2883082	2884482	It is a funny game.
2884642	2885482	It is very witty.
2885902	2886703	It's great to read.
2886803	2889023	It is a game that puts you through a book adventure.
2889664	2890144	And I loved it.
2890744	2891024	All right.
2891482	2896823	I beat Turtles Arcade at 5 o'clock in the morning Were you by yourself or did you have a bunch of other people?
2916053	2916833	I was by myself.
2917093	2919514	Oh, but you get unlimited continues by yourself.
2920195	2921675	How many continues did you have to use?
2923036	2923936	Oh, I don't even know.
2924997	2927578	Call me back and brag when it's three or less, buddy.
2929819	2930599	Alright, just teasing.
2930619	2931599	Congratulations.
2932640	2933140	It's fine.
2933480	2938522	You know, actually, there's a YouTube I saw somewhere of a guy running through the entire game on one credit.
2938742	2939422	It was amazing.
2941583	2942424	I don't know how anyone does it.
2944036	2946858	A lot of people claim about, you know, single credit arcade runs.
2946958	2950901	And I know I don't have any game I could say I've done such a thing with.
2950961	2951381	Me neither.
2952742	2952982	All right.
2953843	2954443	All right, Jason.
2954483	2956004	Well, thanks for all you do for us.
2956204	2957925	And we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls.
2957965	2958245	All righty?
2959246	2959426	Sweet.
2959666	2959927	Later.
2961307	2961788	Have a good night.
2962028	2962328	You too.
2962868	2963249	All right.
2963309	2965690	If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2965790	2966771	Remember, it's your show too.
2966831	2968812	We want to hear what you guys have to say.
2969333	2972775	So let's go to another call here on the Skype line.
2973223	2974163	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2974183	2974604	Who's this?
2976184	2977285	Hey, this is Dark Shy.
2977885	2978785	Hi, Dark Shy?
2980206	2980926	Yeah.
2980946	2981507	Ah, Dark Shy.
2981547	2982447	What's on your mind, my friend?
2982467	2985228	First, I want to say it's kind of amazing.
2985248	2986509	It's the first time on the air.
2986529	2989770	I was going to say, I don't recognize your name as calling in before.
2989790	2992011	I know your name from chat, but you've never called in before.
2992051	2992891	So, welcome, noob.
2995292	2995873	What's on your mind?
2996353	3001595	So, well, first off, I just saw 300 today, and I heard of a game coming out.
3003977	3008240	And my friends all, so I saw like, oh, it should be on PS3.
3008380	3010241	It's so amazing it deserves to be on PS3.
3011342	3012322	And I've never heard of it.
3012462	3013543	Like, what?
3014924	3019126	It does sound a little bit like a fanboy's wet dream, such as Kill Bill, the game.
3019707	3023069	If there's any game that's slated to come out, Loki would know about it.
3023389	3023069	300?
3023429	3024429	Are they really making a game out of 300?
3024470	3026251	Yeah, they did a PSP game.
3027011	3028552	And it wasn't very good.
3029236	3031457	I'm thinking... Did he not get his PSP and his PS3 confused, maybe?
3057873	3062455	I told him that he said it deserves to be on PS3.
3062475	3065416	He's saying, like, oh, it's so amazing.
3066216	3069257	But at the same time, the PS3 wasn't all that great, so...
3075600	3076400	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3102101	3108723	It could be possible you get another game or two out of this a little later on down the line, especially with the movie being as popular as it is.
3110344	3111684	Yeah, yeah.
3111804	3112644	I have one more thing.
3112964	3113685	Sure, what's up?
3115285	3127009	Alright, I remember so many years ago about hearing about Phantom Hourglass, and it just came out now, or coming out now, and I'm like, is this like a tradition for the Zelda games or something?
3127689	3127889	Yes.
3127909	3127989	Yes.
3129005	3130125	Pretty much, sadly.
3130185	3133006	Yeah, the Phantom Hourglass, they debuted at what?
3133046	3137347	Didn't they first show that off at E305, I almost want to say?
3138268	3139228	Maybe it was E306.
3139428	3144469	No, it was either E306 or it was either that or Tokyo Game Show or something like that.
3144649	3146090	Yeah, it has been a long time.
3146430	3148731	Yeah, it's pretty much tradition for the Zelda series at this point.
3150191	3152812	Oh, except the CD-i ones came out pretty quickly.
3155212	3155693	Just kidding.
3156333	3156613	All right.
3157475	3159076	Well, are you looking forward to Phantom Hourglass?
3160617	3163039	Yeah, I'm a big fan of Zelda.
3163599	3167682	What do you think of the multiplayer mode we were talking about?
3167742	3169223	Do you think it's going to be fun on the internet?
3171184	3176848	I'm hoping so, because I can't really think of Zelda online, so maybe they'll surprise me.
3177988	3184392	It's hard to think about Nintendo online these days, but yeah, I mean, Zelda's definitely a step in the right direction, so we'll see.
3185773	3186254	Yeah, yeah.
3186574	3186794	All right.
3187042	3189883	Well, DarkSakura, thanks so much for the call, and call again sometime, all right?
3191204	3191504	All right.
3191864	3192184	Later.
3194025	3197026	Have fun with Phantom Hourglass and all those hours you're going to be putting into that.
3197686	3198046	All right.
3198767	3200568	I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
3200608	3202588	Sorry to those folks that did not get through.
3202648	3203569	We apologize.
3204349	3206570	But everybody's trying to hammer the line there, so it happens.
3207590	3207931	Let's see.
3208011	3214013	Going to the chat room, trying to read the comments there to some of those previous calls we took.
3214548	3217649	SSJ100 Matt says, I hear the 300 game is awful.
3219610	3221931	GS68 says, bring on the max 300 jokes.
3223612	3227574	Let's see, SSJ100 Matt says, you could have 302 electric boogaloo.
3229514	3230315	All right, there you have it.
3231775	3233056	We'll take more calls next week.
3233076	3236737	Of course, again, Loki's Challenge to leave us a dirty joke on the Skype line.
3236757	3238958	That's open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3238998	3240159	You can do that all week long.
3241110	3245374	And I'm going to go around and see if there's any last minute stories anybody would like to share tonight.
3245494	3246395	Last minute stories.
3248937	3252640	I've been trying to find the information on it, but I can't actually find it.
3253500	3258464	There's actually a new pinball table coming out later this year that's a Monty Python theme.
3260106	3261227	And we're actually going to get it.
3261387	3262508	Like a Spamalot table?
3263128	3265710	I don't know if it's Spamalot, because there's already a Holy Grail table.
3266251	3268853	I thought that they were either going to do Meaning of Life or Life of Brian.
3268893	3269834	I think it's Meaning of Life.
3271044	3271805	So I think that's pretty cool.
3272785	3274767	Always look on the bright side.
3274787	3275808	That was Life of Brian.
3275868	3277289	Yeah, I know, but, you know.
3277309	3283234	Meaning of Life had, um... Had, um... The, uh... It's just a waifu thin mint.
3285656	3288818	Wasn't the Meaning of Life the one that was in, like, the office building in the beginning?
3289759	3294243	That was actually a different... It was supposed to be a lot shorter.
3295063	3297505	But, unfortunately, they let Terry Gilliam have his way.
3298166	3299567	And it was the, uh...
3301072	3301772	What was it?
3302072	3303933	The Crimson something assurance.
3304293	3305673	I remember that scene going on forever.
3305693	3306693	With all the tax preparers.
3306953	3308453	All forever a scene went on.
3308494	3309274	I love that scene.
3309594	3309894	All right.
3310314	3310594	Anyhow.
3310734	3313094	Isn't it great to charge your own accountant?
3313975	3314495	That one.
3315835	3322476	TheRobD says about the Amani Python table, every time you hit a bumper, I fart in your general direction every time you hit a bumper.
3322836	3324457	That's cute.
3324517	3326797	LegendZaku says, and now for something completely different.
3328206	3329387	and Monty Python Pinball Table.
3329927	3330968	That's a good name for a table.
3331608	3332528	Loki, anything from you?
3333729	3334830	Just a couple small things.
3335290	3340313	One, Splatterhouse is confirmed apparently for Virtual Console this Monday.
3341753	3343014	So we're going to be seeing that.
3343174	3348577	I'm going to tell you right now, Splatterhouse is one of those games you're going to think back to your childhood and go, this game was awesome.
3348837	3352319	But when you all download it on Monday, the game was not that good.
3352839	3353680	It really wasn't.
3354934	3356155	I remember how bad it was.
3356435	3357376	But it's still funny though.
3357936	3362659	If you want that Friday the 13th vibe to it, there you go.
3363199	3364700	Let's see what else here.
3365300	3371944	Oh, apparently it started now on the PlayStation 3 on one of the previous firmwares.
3371964	3376847	Up until 1.51, they're seeing holes and they've exploited a TIFF exploit.
3382349	3388512	basically causing a buffer overflow like they did on the PSP to run their own code.
3388932	3396536	So it's only a matter of time before they break the PlayStation 3 and have piracy rampant on there as well as homebrew and stuff.
3396616	3399318	So I'm waiting.
3401479	3401779	That's it.
3402299	3402599	All right.
3403299	3407121	And I don't have anything either, so I guess we're here to the end of the show.
3407662	3408222	So that's it.
3408940	3410400	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3410560	3411841	We're finishing pretty fucking early.
3411861	3413981	Yeah, this is a short show tonight.
3414001	3417422	It's kind of weird for us, but that's okay.
3417482	3418242	It's been a, you know, compact and
3436991	3437412	Good show.
3437432	3438234	A lot of information.
3438274	3441380	We talked about a lot in Part A and Part B. We'll do it all again next week.
3441540	3444667	In the meantime, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent.
3445106	3445827	Internet Radio.
3445867	3450611	You guys are awesome, and it's because of you we continue to do this show every week in and week out.
3450931	3456997	So we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio, March the 25th, for episode number 225.
3457077	3458178	Is that like a landmark number?
3458458	3460640	Because it's like, you know, multiple 25?
3460961	3462142	I don't know.
3462282	3462782	Not so much.
3462862	3463143	All right.
3463163	3464324	250 maybe.
3464344	3464944	250 maybe.
3464964	3467307	Or our five-year birthday is just around the corner.
3467927	3469589	I say we get a stripper for the fifth birthday.
3469629	3469929	We'll see.
3470575	3472916	Alright, anyhow, in the meantime, that's it for this week.
3472936	3478259	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio and tune in next week to find out which website calls us a liar next.
3478619	3479240	That'll be fun.
