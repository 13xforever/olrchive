0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	12000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
12000	15000	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	22000	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
22000	28000	It is March 18, 2007, and you're on Part B of our podcast.
28000	31000	Remember, we tape Orange Lounge Radio in two halves every week.
31000	35000	If you're listening to us on the podcast or audio blog feed and you haven't yet heard Part A,
35000	41000	you really should go back into iTunes or Podcast Alley or Yahoo Podcast, Dig Podcast,
41000	43000	whatever you use to listen to this program.
43000	46000	You should go back and grab Part A because it's really great.
46000	51000	Loki goes and tells us about the beautiful Katamari controversy you could say around the internet.
51000	55000	He gives us the definitive date for Halo 3 in September, as he's heard,
55000	59000	and gives us a whole lot of other release date stuff in Part A.
59000	60000	So check that out.
60000	63000	Not that I'm saying you shouldn't listen to this half of the show, too,
63000	65000	because we have some good stories for you in this half, right?
65000	67000	Because we missed so much stuff in the first half of the program.
67000	69000	We do tape live on Sunday nights at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
69000	71000	Join us sometime, shall we?
71000	73000	All right, let's get into some of that news I was talking about.
73000	78000	Okay, so anyway, one thing that's been going around, it's kind of a rumor right now.
78000	84000	Best Buy, there has been a shot from Best Buy's system, their POS system,
84000	89000	and it's basically, well, it's a printout, I should say, from their computer system,
89000	94000	showing the status of the 20GB model of the PS3 is discontinued.
94000	99000	And a lot of people have been saying, or actually Sony has been saying,
99000	104000	that it's because it's a choice for retailers, what systems they bring in,
104000	107000	and that's why I haven't been able to find 20GB systems.
107000	110000	Now, here's an interesting spin on it, though.
110000	115000	Our company, we haven't been able to get 20GB systems for a while now,
115000	119000	and they basically have been discontinued in our system as well,
119000	123000	and this has been, I think, going on for about over a month.
123000	127000	So I wouldn't be surprised if this is true, if they're discontinuing the 20GB system,
127000	130000	probably because they're making more money off the 60GB system,
130000	133000	and not a lot of people were snatching up the 20GB system.
133000	136000	I don't know, I think 20GB was still pretty fine.
136000	141000	I mean, 20 is enough space for right now, at least, so I don't know.
141000	144000	Not for the Xbox 360 with all that movie stuff.
144000	147000	I'm almost out of space, so I don't know.
147000	148000	I think about that with the PlayStation 3.
148000	152000	When I jump ship, I probably will get the 60GB model just because I'm a consumer whore.
152000	154000	And how?
154000	158000	I will just upgrade my hard drive in there.
158000	160000	Well, here's something cool.
160000	163000	Speaking of, we had talked about Tecmo earlier.
163000	167000	Tecmo is bringing out Ninja Gaiden Sigma.
167000	173000	It has new backgrounds, enemies, characters, animations, textures,
173000	176000	completely revamped for the next system.
176000	182000	You can partially or fully install the game on the PS3 to help with load time.
182000	188000	It will run at 60 frames per second, self-shadowing, and in 720p.
188000	191000	So lots of Ninja Gaiden action.
191000	195000	You also get a playable Rachel.
195000	202000	Apparently, she's supposed to be very bouncy because it's Team Ninja.
202000	207000	My question is will I actually be able to get anywhere in the game
207000	210000	without getting frustrated so that I throw my controller through the screen?
210000	212000	Nobody can help that you suck at it, Rob.
212000	214000	No, everybody sucks at Ninja Gaiden.
214000	216000	It's a fucking hard game.
216000	218000	Dan was doing pretty good at it.
218000	221000	Well, Dan is a god among men then, I guess.
221000	222000	I don't know what to tell you.
222000	224000	Well, I only marry awesome.
224000	225000	All right.
225000	229000	Anyhow, a game I'm really looking forward to on the PlayStation 3,
229000	232000	and how sad is it that this is one of the games I'm really looking forward to
232000	234000	on the PlayStation 3?
234000	238000	Loki's wagging his finger already because he knows what I'm going to say.
238000	242000	Sing Star on the PlayStation 3 is coming out, of course.
242000	245000	A lot of people thought it was going to be something that was
245000	250000	like a network download, but no, I think at E3 they said it was going to be a full game.
250000	254000	Well, it is coming on a Blu-ray disc, and there's going to be HD videos on it,
254000	257000	30 songs on the disc.
257000	260000	We don't know exactly what 30 songs we're talking about yet,
260000	264000	but I seem to remember at E3 last year,
264000	267000	they demoed Survivor by Destiny's Child as one of the songs.
267000	268000	Am I on crack?
268000	270000	Wasn't there a Fallout boys song?
270000	272000	Wasn't Dance Dance one of them too?
272000	275000	I could be wrong, but if you saw them at E3,
275000	277000	chances are those licenses have carried over.
277000	278000	We'll see.
278000	284000	Regardless, I will make it my life mission to, on game 3.0 or whatever they call it,
284000	289000	I will make it my mission to get Loki YouTubed singing something.
289000	291000	Maybe Survivor would be a good song for Loki,
291000	294000	but we'll get that on the Internet for all our listeners to download.
294000	297000	Or just Bobby Black Wolf because he's Loki's only friend on the PlayStation 3.
297000	299000	I don't know.
299000	300000	No, I'm not.
300000	302000	I'm sorry, you have like seven friends now.
302000	303000	I'm not his only friend.
303000	304000	Oh, sorry.
304000	305000	He's not my only friend.
305000	307000	You're very popular.
307000	309000	Exactly.
309000	318000	Anyways, something that's kind of popular on the PC is distributed computing.
318000	324000	They have a similar thing with folding at home as well as SETI at home, that type of stuff.
324000	327000	Well, I think they even talked about this back a long time ago
327000	329000	when they were talking about the cell processor.
329000	334000	Now you can actually, with the new firmware update 1.6,
334000	336000	they'll be downloading folding at home as well.
336000	343000	It's a funky little screensaver that helps process stuff to cure cancer.
343000	352000	So you might have a part in curing diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis,
352000	355000	and many cancers and stuff like that.
355000	357000	Let me write that $600 check right now.
357000	360000	It's for a good cause, right?
360000	362000	Exactly.
362000	365000	You know, I don't know.
365000	371000	It's interesting, that whole distributed, I think that website distributed net had something like that.
371000	375000	It's a very interesting concept.
375000	376000	I don't know as it is.
376000	379000	The PlayStation 3 does suck a lot of power out of it.
379000	383000	I mean, if this was something on the Wii, I can have it in standby and it would do this.
383000	385000	There's Wii Connect 24 for you, huh?
385000	393000	I don't know if I really want my PlayStation 3 with this giant screensaver on HDTV
393000	397000	just sitting there all day long, even if it was for a good cause.
397000	398000	Fuck that shit.
398000	401000	It should be calculating what the winning lotto numbers are for me.
401000	404000	That's the kind of computing I want to see the PlayStation 3 doing.
404000	409000	I want it to see it earning money to pay for itself.
409000	411000	That's what it should be doing.
411000	413000	Go out and get a job, PlayStation 3.
413000	416000	Go out and watch some dishes somewhere.
416000	422000	Get a job cooking French fries someplace.
422000	423000	Work the streets if you have to.
423000	424000	I don't care.
424000	426000	Just help me pay the rent, PlayStation 3.
426000	427000	Pimp that Blu-ray.
427000	430000	$600, make you holla.
430000	432000	Anyway.
432000	433000	Yeah, make you holla.
433000	438000	Why did I spend $600 on this goddamn Blu-ray player?
438000	440000	Anyway.
440000	443000	Well, in other news regarding the player itself,
443000	448000	the 1.6 firmware update for PS3 has a remote play function,
448000	459000	so you can bring up any audio, video, photo stored on the PS3 using your PSP.
459000	462000	Actually, just anywhere you can find an internet connection.
462000	464000	So that's kind of cool.
464000	467000	Porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn.
467000	470000	Mighty porn, mighty porn.
470000	473000	Okay.
473000	477000	Sorry, anytime you talk about sharing photos and movies and all that stuff,
477000	482000	I can't help but think of porn.
482000	486000	Is that so wrong?
486000	491000	I also can't help but think of Killzone on the PlayStation 3 coming out in July.
491000	493000	Actually, there's a lot of other things I can think of.
493000	496000	I just needed to transition.
496000	497000	What?
497000	498000	Oh, go ahead.
498000	500000	Well, anyway.
500000	504000	Phil Harrison revealed some footage of Killzone on the PlayStation 3,
504000	507000	of course, at Game Developers Conference.
507000	514000	I guess one of those things where the feedback from the journalist was not so hot,
514000	517000	so they didn't end up showing it at the full Sony conference,
517000	519000	even though folks were reporting they could see it on the screen,
519000	521000	like in the PS3, they didn't play it.
521000	524000	It was a tease thing.
524000	530000	But according to IGN, the game will, I guess, come out in July.
530000	532000	It's not coming out in July.
532000	534000	The demo will come out in July.
534000	535000	Interesting.
535000	538000	Yeah, the game itself is nowhere near done.
538000	543000	But we'll probably see it at E3 or something like that.
543000	545000	Interesting.
545000	549000	Another game that we can be looking forward to pretty soon,
549000	552000	well, a few months off at least, but Grand Theft Auto IV.
552000	558000	And it is thought, the rumor is that it's going to be set in a New York City setting.
558000	567000	And this rumor comes from a couple of people that have been contracted
567000	571000	to come up with New York City themed music for the game.
571000	577000	So, you know, possibly hinting at a New York City type theme.
577000	579000	If I were to guess, I would say Liberty City,
579000	582000	because that's supposed to be New York City anyways.
582000	584000	So, I don't know.
584000	587000	I would think Liberty City all over again is where it's going to be.
587000	593000	But whatever, they could surprise us and have a real city in there.
593000	598000	Either way, the game's not expected out until October.
598000	604000	However, the first ever trailer of the game will be available March 29th.
604000	607000	And I cannot wait.
607000	609000	And it better not suck.
609000	612000	Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the previous Grand Theft Auto game,
612000	614000	you could fly planes at some point, right?
614000	615000	Yes.
615000	618000	Okay. Now, isn't putting the thing in New York City,
618000	623000	look, I'm trying not to be wrong here, but just thinking aloud here,
623000	628000	by putting Grand Theft Auto in a town very similar to New York City,
628000	631000	doesn't that kind of open it up for folks at home
631000	634000	to do some really unpolitically correct things in their game?
634000	637000	Y'all know what I'm talking about. I don't have to say it.
637000	640000	But you know kids across America are going to try to imitate it.
640000	643000	You know, you can already, to be honest with you,
643000	646000	you can't fly 747s or whatever.
646000	648000	You can't fly giant jet planes.
648000	652000	You can fly biplanes and stuff like that into towers
652000	654000	or jets and stuff like that.
654000	657000	Hell, if you want to do that now, go buy San Andreas
657000	659000	because you can do that right now.
659000	662000	San Andreas was funny because you'd be driving along on a motorcycle
662000	664000	and a plane would crash into you.
664000	667000	Random plane crashes are kind of fun in that game, too.
667000	669000	Either way, it's going to be awesome.
669000	671000	This game is going to sell crazy,
671000	673000	and people are going to get their panties in a bunch
673000	675000	because it's uber violent.
675000	677000	I wouldn't have it any other way.
677000	679000	That's why I bring this up.
679000	682000	DarkShy and Shadowcourse, Rob, you're horrible.
682000	687000	That's why I bring this up because if you're able to do that in the game,
687000	690000	somebody's going to sue over it.
690000	694000	Johnson is going to have his ego all over this crap with another lawsuit.
694000	695000	Let me put it this way.
695000	697000	If I can have Sex with the Hooker in a jet,
697000	699000	flying towards a building,
699000	702000	and then set a nuclear explosion off that wipes out the entire city,
702000	705000	that would be awesome.
705000	709000	Everybody seems to agree here that it's going to take place in the future.
709000	711000	A, it's not really New York City.
711000	714000	B, even if it was modeled after New York City a lot,
714000	716000	it would be a future New York City
716000	719000	where that landmark I was previously referring to would be removed.
719000	724000	But still, I don't know.
724000	727000	I can't help but think they might put something in there
727000	729000	where folks should be able to make it look like that.
729000	731000	All that would happen is you'd crash into the building
731000	732000	and your plane explodes.
732000	736000	The building does not explode or fall apart.
736000	739000	That's all that would happen is you're planning to explode
739000	741000	and be like, huh, it's like 9-11.
741000	743000	And then you'd get it out of your system
743000	745000	and you'd go back to playing the damn game.
745000	747000	Or you'd be like me and do it a few more times
747000	748000	until you got it out of your system.
748000	752000	But can you not see Tack Jomson in a courtroom
752000	756000	playing this footage, telling the judge how Rockstar is evil
756000	758000	and they're Al-Qaeda sympathizers
758000	761000	and the game should be banned from the market forever?
761000	763000	No, no, no. Hold on, hold on.
763000	765000	You're expecting him to actually show footage of the game.
765000	768000	I mean, he's trying to sue them now
768000	770000	about games that haven't even come out yet
770000	771000	that he doesn't know anything about
771000	773000	other than that they are making a game.
773000	774000	He's an idiot.
774000	776000	Okay, that's it. We're not talking about him anymore.
776000	777000	Not done.
777000	779000	He who shall not be named.
779000	782000	Let's not even refer to him. Just done. We're done.
782000	784000	Because there's stories about him this week I'm not talking about.
784000	787000	Didn't we say we were going to do that like a year ago?
787000	788000	What?
788000	790000	And we're done. Done. Stop.
790000	792000	We've already said too much.
792000	795000	Now I keep going to see if Loki's head explodes.
795000	801000	Well, you know what we should do for our foe, our nemesis?
801000	804000	We should send him one of the pink PS2s
804000	806000	that are out in Australia on the 15th.
806000	810000	Do you mean over at...
810000	812000	I had to censor myself.
812000	814000	Is that what you mean by arch nemesis?
814000	816000	No, I was actually...
816000	818000	Well, he's not necessarily an arch nemesis.
818000	820000	He's more like a lackey.
820000	823000	He would be like Toad is to Magneto.
823000	824000	Okay.
824000	828000	No, I was referring to he who shall not be named.
828000	831000	But I think a pink PS2 would just be the perfect thing
831000	834000	to cheer him up and get that stick out of his ass.
834000	841000	But anyway, the pink pinky pink pink pink PlayStation 2
841000	845000	is in Australia as of March 15th.
845000	850000	And it's pink.
850000	852000	It's everything you lived with the PS2.
852000	856000	Dude, I want the Sakura PS2 because it's like sort of purple and shiny.
856000	858000	Anyway.
858000	864000	I swear to God I am sick and tired of hearing about Warhawk
864000	867000	and whether it's going to be on a fucking disc
867000	869000	or downloadable title.
869000	872000	Anyways, because of that, during Game Developers Conference,
872000	874000	because this is back when they said,
874000	877000	okay, downloadable only title, great.
877000	879000	Apparently some people are a little bit pissed off.
879000	882000	A few people left the actual development team
882000	884000	because they were frustrated like this
884000	888000	and basically saying crap product will sell like crap
888000	891000	if it's on the shelf or not.
891000	893000	So that's kind of my take on this thing.
893000	895000	The game looked okay, but you know what?
895000	899000	I couldn't give a shit about whether it's on a disc,
899000	902000	it's on the PlayStation Network or both.
902000	904000	Just release the damn game because I swear to God,
904000	906000	the longer it takes this game to come out,
906000	908000	the worse it seems to get.
908000	910000	So that is it.
910000	913000	I'm done with Warhawk.
913000	914000	I don't care about Warhawk.
914000	917000	I will never read another story about the game coming out on disc
917000	921000	or on the network or at all.
921000	923000	You know, why are we bothered putting together an outline
923000	926000	if you're just going to skip my stories?
926000	928000	Whatever.
928000	930000	No, it's fine.
930000	932000	Didn't we talk about it last week anyway?
932000	933000	Yeah.
933000	935000	PlayStation 3 is getting episodic games.
935000	937000	Who cares?
937000	939000	Because I remember us having a conversation about this last week.
939000	942000	Who has put together successfully an episodic franchise
942000	945000	except for Sam & Max as the only one I can think of
945000	948000	in the past little while that's been successful?
948000	949000	I don't care about episodic games.
949000	951000	You know why they're doing episodic games?
951000	952000	It's because they go,
952000	955000	Ch-ching, ch-ching, oh, I can make some more money off this shit.
955000	956000	Yeah.
956000	959000	Great, let's put some more episodic content out there
959000	962000	because the last stuff's done so well so far.
962000	964000	Flaming Bozo in chat room says,
964000	966000	Grand Theft Auto IV is going episodic.
966000	971000	It has added content, but it has a full game before it.
971000	974000	I guess you could say Oblivion, in a way, is episodic.
974000	975000	Sort of, yeah.
975000	976000	A little bit.
976000	977000	Well, it's the add-ons.
977000	979000	Shivering Isles is a bit of a new episode.
979000	983000	Resistance will have episodic content, which I can, whatever.
983000	986000	Well, some of the episodic content you look forward to
986000	988000	in each and every episode of Orange Lounge Radio
988000	990000	is our mailbag.
990000	992000	It's the part of the show where you can interact with us
992000	995000	simply by sending an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
995000	999000	Dark Sakura will put some hand sanitizing rubber gloves on,
999000	1002000	dive into the mailbag, and pull out her favorite emails
1002000	1005000	and her least favorite emails to read here on the air.
1005000	1007000	So you can't send average emails because they don't get read.
1007000	1008000	No.
1008000	1010000	We try to read as many as we can,
1010000	1013000	but since, you know, we're so popular and all.
1013000	1015000	Yeah, right.
1015000	1017000	No, but sometimes we just get too many.
1017000	1019000	We can't read them here on the program.
1019000	1020000	But Dark Sakura does read them all.
1020000	1021000	Sometimes.
1021000	1023000	I read most of them, too, actually.
1023000	1027000	So unless you're a spammer, then do not actually send this email
1027000	1030000	because we're banning IPs.
1030000	1036000	Let's open up the mailbag, shall we?
1036000	1040000	Well, we have three.
1040000	1042000	Dear O.L.R., I recently got a new gaming machine
1042000	1044000	and thought I'd send in a review.
1044000	1048000	A couple weeks ago, I bought myself a shiny Commodore 128.
1048000	1050000	I'd been wanting to play a 64 for some time,
1050000	1053000	largely due to the opinions expressed on your fine show,
1053000	1056000	but eventually the used market prices dropped on the 128 model
1056000	1059000	and I decided that it was worth a dollar to get a newer machine.
1059000	1061000	I'm sure glad I did.
1061000	1064000	What, Rob?
1064000	1066000	I love whoever wrote this already.
1066000	1067000	Finish it.
1067000	1068000	Just read the whole thing.
1068000	1069000	This is beautiful.
1069000	1070000	Though having lesser system specs,
1070000	1073000	the C128 still holds up well feature-wise
1073000	1075000	against other consoles on the market.
1075000	1076000	It offers backwards compatibility,
1076000	1078000	just like each of the major consoles on the market,
1078000	1081000	and even supports homebrew, just like modified PSPs do,
1081000	1084000	which so far only Microsoft seems to be interested in with their consoles.
1084000	1088000	The C128 offers more buttons than any current console,
1088000	1090000	and it is available in a stylish off-white color
1090000	1093000	similar to the DS Lite, Xbox 360, and Wii,
1093000	1095000	although somewhat less glossy.
1095000	1098000	Unfortunately, it still lacks some of the features of the other consoles.
1098000	1102000	The 128 does not currently support HD output,
1102000	1105000	but it is not believed that the Commodore will be addressing that problem
1105000	1107000	through firmware or otherwise.
1107000	1110000	The command mode basic interpreter is also a little bit more difficult to use
1110000	1112000	than, say, channels on the Wii,
1112000	1114000	where everything is laid out for you,
1114000	1116000	and you just point at what you want instead of typing
1116000	1122000	load, quote, asterisk, quote, comma, eight,
1122000	1124000	and cursing whenever you hit the wrong key
1124000	1126000	or the file list is longer than one screen.
1126000	1129000	I remember that for a freaking load runner.
1129000	1132000	Of course, a system is only as good as the games that are on it,
1132000	1135000	and while there are very few C128 games,
1135000	1139000	backwards compatibility means that I can enjoy any C64 game
1139000	1142000	I can get my hands on, of which there are many,
1142000	1145000	and if you know the discs haven't disintegrated over the last two decades,
1145000	1147000	which I understand is a problem,
1147000	1150000	I cannot seem to get Impossible Mission or The Last Ninja to work.
1150000	1153000	I even tried blowing into them, but no such luck.
1153000	1156000	Overall, however, I find the Commodore 128 to be a fine addition
1156000	1158000	to my game console lineup,
1158000	1160000	and I intend to have many more hours of fun with it.
1160000	1163000	By right sucks, Warrior Bob.
1163000	1166000	Seriously, Warrior Bob, I want to have your baby.
1166000	1169000	That was an awesome email.
1169000	1172000	Imagine, we could have a little house full of little VIC-20s
1172000	1175000	and plus fours and sixteens running around everywhere.
1175000	1177000	You know, that email was beautiful.
1177000	1179000	Oh, he also sends another email to you.
1179000	1180000	Oh, really?
1180000	1181000	You're a rock star.
1181000	1184000	Oh, we're so going to get it on with our Commodore.
1184000	1187000	We should do some Commodore Live gaming,
1187000	1190000	and we could play, God, what the hell could you play over the modem
1190000	1194000	on the Commodore 64 on my 300 baud modem
1194000	1196000	that plugged into the back of the Commodore 64?
1196000	1198000	What kind of games could I play?
1198000	1200000	I guess over the local bulletin board systems.
1200000	1202000	God, no, not even then.
1202000	1204000	I didn't really hit until I had an IBM.
1204000	1207000	Was there anything you could play over the modem on the Commodore 64?
1207000	1209000	Surely we had a modem for some reason.
1209000	1211000	I played a whole shitload of Kix.
1211000	1212000	Maybe there was.
1212000	1213000	Kix was my game.
1213000	1214000	We'll get together and play some Kix.
1214000	1217000	Well, the last email comes from...
1217000	1219000	Wait, you said three emails.
1219000	1221000	I know, the second one was also from Warrior Bob.
1221000	1222000	Oh.
1222000	1224000	This one's from Philly Girl.
1224000	1225000	Hi, Orange Lounge.
1225000	1227000	I think you are the best podcast ever.
1227000	1229000	You don't know how much I appreciate you guys,
1229000	1231000	but on to what I'm emailing you.
1231000	1233000	I've got a dirty joke for you.
1233000	1235000	What's six to eight inches long,
1235000	1236000	goes in and out of your mouth,
1236000	1238000	and leaves the white stuff around your lips?
1238000	1239000	A penis.
1239000	1241000	A toothbrush.
1241000	1243000	P.S., I've already signed up on your website
1243000	1244000	because you guys are so great.
1244000	1246000	My screen name is Vanity Angel from DDR.
1246000	1248000	Thanks for putting this on the show.
1248000	1254000	The email had nothing to do with video games.
1254000	1255000	Somebody just emailed us going,
1255000	1257000	hey, I want to tell you a dirty joke.
1257000	1258000	Pretty much.
1258000	1260000	God, I love our listeners.
1260000	1263000	In fact, that's even better.
1263000	1266000	What you need to do is call our Skype line
1266000	1269000	or our toll-free number.
1269000	1272000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
1272000	1275000	And leave us a voicemail with your favorite dirty joke.
1275000	1277000	That is a wonderful idea.
1277000	1279000	Let's have a little contest.
1279000	1282000	Let's see who can be the best OLR comedian.
1282000	1286000	Leave us a voicemail on our Skype line
1286000	1288000	or 800 number sometime during the week,
1288000	1291000	and we'll play some of our favorites on next week's show.
1291000	1292000	Just don't forget to leave your name.
1292000	1293000	There's a lot of good stuff.
1293000	1294000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
1294000	1295000	Toll-free.
1295000	1296000	U.S. and Canada.
1296000	1298000	U.K. Sorry, you guys are screwed.
1298000	1299000	You're Australia.
1299000	1302000	You guys got to use the regular Skype method to do it.
1302000	1303000	Orange launch radio on Skype.
1303000	1306000	That's a beautiful idea.
1306000	1310000	If they're video game jokes, that's even better.
1310000	1313000	More points if it's video game themed.
1313000	1315000	Like dirty Princess Peach jokes.
1315000	1318000	That would be great.
1318000	1321000	This is also great, and it has nothing to do with porn
1321000	1322000	or emails or any of that.
1322000	1323000	Wow, there really wasn't that many emails this week.
1323000	1324000	That's kind of sad.
1324000	1325000	I cry.
1325000	1326000	Yeah.
1326000	1327000	Aww.
1327000	1328000	Mail back to orangelaunchradio.com.
1328000	1330000	Send us more stuff.
1330000	1331000	This is great.
1331000	1333000	Great, great news.
1333000	1339000	Vivendi is looking to actually revive Sierra.
1339000	1341000	Oh, this is great news because Vivendi,
1341000	1345000	you know, years ago, they bought out Sierra or whatever
1345000	1347000	and they offshoot Sierra online.
1347000	1354000	And now it looks like Vivendi is going to be reviving Sierra somewhat.
1354000	1358000	Sierra, of course, is well known in the PC gaming segment,
1358000	1360000	but the name is going to get ramped up in the next few years
1360000	1364000	with other games that were originally released on the Sierra brand.
1364000	1368000	World in Conflict and Time Shift will be names that are coming out very soon
1368000	1370000	that will have the Sierra brand.
1370000	1375000	Here's a quote here from Vivendi CEO Bruce Hack.
1375000	1378000	Quote, the revival of the Sierra brand comes from product.
1378000	1381000	Over time, as our products become better and establish themselves
1381000	1385000	as perennial franchises, the name Sierra will be given a stronger life.
1385000	1387000	As we move forward, our products get stronger,
1387000	1393000	and as they are established as franchises, the name Sierra will be strengthened.
1393000	1396000	No news yet, though, on a new Police Quest game, which kind of makes me sad.
1396000	1397000	Or Leisure Suit Larry.
1397000	1401000	Well, I guess, then again, Leisure Suit Larry went somewhere else, right?
1401000	1403000	He went to a dirty, dirty place.
1403000	1405000	Yeah, I remember that console title a couple years ago.
1405000	1407000	It wasn't that hot.
1407000	1408000	Or King's Quest.
1408000	1410000	I mean, I know there's a fan project, don't get me wrong,
1410000	1412000	the silver lining game, but who wouldn't?
1412000	1414000	I mean, even the guys behind that, I'm sure,
1414000	1417000	would love to see something official as well to complement that, though.
1417000	1419000	We'll see.
1419000	1420000	Yeah.
1420000	1422000	Anyways, in the meantime, if you can't get your King's Quest
1422000	1426000	or Leisure Suit Larry or Police Quest or Space Quest fix,
1426000	1429000	you can always get your Sam & Max fix.
1429000	1433000	And, of course, they've already, I think they're up through Episode 6 now
1433000	1437000	of the first season of the Sam & Max episodic game.
1437000	1441000	Well, if you don't want to download it via a download service,
1441000	1445000	you can play it when it comes to retail.
1445000	1448000	And it actually is being, it's heading to retail,
1448000	1451000	thanks to Joe Wood for the U.K.,
1451000	1454000	and I forget who's doing it in the U.S.,
1454000	1458000	but you soon will be able to purchase Sam & Max,
1458000	1464000	and it will be available in August of 2007.
1464000	1466000	Comments from the chat room on the last story.
1466000	1469000	Sorry to deviate a little bit, but some interesting things on Sierra.
1469000	1472000	James Patrick in chat says, please, Sierra is dead.
1472000	1474000	Sierra Studios, we're in the Sierra Mountains.
1474000	1476000	That studio is closed.
1476000	1480000	Therefore, Sierra, the real Sierra, is dead.
1480000	1486000	And the adventure company is the one bringing it over here to the United States.
1486000	1490000	I love Sam & Max, and I don't know why I haven't played it yet.
1490000	1492000	By the way, Sierra and Sam & Max have nothing to do with each other,
1492000	1495000	but the chat room is a little bit behind.
1495000	1501000	There's a little bit of live lag, so there you have it.
1501000	1504000	Sorry, I had a complete and utter brain fart.
1504000	1506000	Why? What happened? Were you daydreaming during the show?
1506000	1507000	Is that what's going on?
1507000	1512000	No, I did my Reiki class today, so I've been sort of out of it.
1512000	1518000	Maybe me and Captain America can run off and have a family together.
1518000	1521000	I'll pursue my massage therapy,
1521000	1525000	and he can have a successful business as a crime fighter.
1525000	1528000	What the fuck?
1528000	1529000	Okay, so how about a story?
1529000	1531000	I'd like to see that in a comic.
1531000	1532000	How about a story?
1532000	1539000	No, how about more Jamie and Captain America slash fanfic?
1539000	1541000	What?
1541000	1543000	We'll name our family the Avengers.
1543000	1547000	That's the custom license plate we'll have on our minivan.
1547000	1551000	Can I please see this posted on fanfic.net or whatever that site is?
1551000	1554000	No, because anyone who writes any fanfiction at all
1554000	1562000	involving any characterization of me will be sued for libel or something.
1562000	1563000	No sense of humor.
1563000	1565000	No, I have no sense of humor because it was stupid.
1565000	1569000	Then make a character named Sark Dakra.
1569000	1570000	No.
1570000	1571000	I can see it now.
1571000	1574000	They're barbecuing on a Weber grill that's painted to look like
1574000	1577000	the Captain America shield.
1577000	1580000	That was stupid.
1580000	1582000	How about the next?
1582000	1587000	Hey, you're the one that had a brain fart and derailed the show.
1587000	1588000	Shut up.
1588000	1589000	No pie for you.
1589000	1591000	I was going to get you pie.
1591000	1595000	Anyway, story.
1595000	1598000	For anyone who likes their MMOs,
1598000	1602000	Turbine is offering the former subscribers of the Dungeons & Dragons
1602000	1605000	online game a free weekend of gaming,
1605000	1610000	actually which is over right now.
1610000	1612000	But for those in Europe,
1612000	1618000	you're going to get an additional bonus for 10 days of free gaming.
1618000	1623000	So you can enjoy their module 3.3.
1623000	1628000	It's supposed to beef up their character stuff.
1628000	1630000	Also, for those who are currently subscribed,
1630000	1637000	you will get 50% more experience and a plus one to loot found
1637000	1640000	and lots of live events.
1640000	1641000	So basically they're saying,
1641000	1644000	we don't want to go out of business.
1644000	1647000	So there you go.
1647000	1648000	All righty.
1648000	1651000	Well, changing gears completely here, talking about some,
1651000	1654000	well, maybe, I don't know, maybe they'll show D&D online at this.
1654000	1655000	Who knows?
1655000	1658000	But of course, the E for All Expo is being held October 18th
1658000	1660000	through the 21st at the LA Convention Center,
1660000	1662000	which is where E3 used to be.
1662000	1666000	And of course, E for All is supposed to be kind of like that public version
1666000	1671000	of E3, but we're not sure exactly how much like E3 it's going to be
1671000	1674000	because part of us are kind of thinking,
1674000	1677000	well, they probably won't actually show any new games there.
1677000	1680000	They're just going to kind of show existing games and have tournaments.
1680000	1681000	Who knows what's going to happen?
1681000	1687000	But we do know that Sony and Nintendo have both signed on board.
1687000	1691000	So they are going to be appearing at the E for All Expo.
1691000	1696000	Now, the Expo is actually only going to be in the south hall.
1696000	1698000	Now, those of you that went to E3 in the past know that
1698000	1700000	Nintendo and Sony were traditionally in the west hall.
1700000	1703000	So therefore, we know that Sony and Nintendo's boost will be
1703000	1707000	a little bit smaller than what we know from E3 past.
1707000	1710000	But still, the fact that they are going really gives a boost,
1710000	1714000	I think, in some regards to the E for All Expo.
1714000	1716000	If you want to go, hey, it's only $100,
1716000	1718000	but the tickets are not currently on sale.
1718000	1722000	They will be made available in the future, I guess.
1722000	1724000	But certainly, Sony and Nintendo signing on
1724000	1727000	does really help out this new show.
1727000	1728000	So we'll see what happens.
1728000	1730000	Will they be using Kensha Hall?
1730000	1731000	That would be fun.
1731000	1734000	They'll probably have a gun show going on in Kensha Hall while this is going on.
1734000	1735000	Gun show?
1735000	1737000	No, seriously.
1737000	1738000	One time...
1738000	1739000	They should do Kensha Con.
1739000	1740000	No, for real.
1740000	1744000	Like, one year I went to the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention
1744000	1747000	in Las Vegas, which is at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
1747000	1750000	And we had the right side of the building for the costume contest,
1750000	1753000	the live speakers, because they had people from the movie there and everything.
1753000	1756000	And then the left side was a gun show.
1756000	1761000	So you had people in fishnets and full...
1761000	1764000	For those that have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.
1764000	1768000	Full Dr. Frank-N-Furter garb and little Columbias in sequined outfits.
1768000	1771000	People just basically dressed like fucking freaks,
1771000	1774000	intermingling with the gun show people.
1774000	1780000	And the most hilarious part was that the ATM was in the gun show room.
1780000	1783000	So if any Rocky people wanted money to buy their crap,
1783000	1786000	they had to actually go into the gun show and get pointed at
1786000	1788000	and stared at by the folks there.
1788000	1792000	So I would love to see the gun show go on at the same...
1792000	1793000	Or the doll show.
1793000	1796000	Because it's also inevitable that the gun show and the doll show is always together.
1796000	1797000	Have you noticed this?
1797000	1799000	There's always, like, a gun show and a doll show.
1799000	1800000	Or a bridal pair.
1800000	1804000	Yeah, the gun show, the doll show, and the bridal pair.
1804000	1805000	Anyway, sorry.
1805000	1808000	The Dolls with Guns show.
1808000	1809000	That'd be funny.
1809000	1810000	Anyways...
1810000	1813000	Poto says, Guns next to games?
1813000	1817000	Just what he who shall not be named once.
1817000	1821000	Anyways, so there's a brand new game coming out now
1821000	1823000	that's probably one of those serious games
1823000	1827000	that will help kids deal with the complex emotions
1827000	1831000	surrounding marriage, or divorce in this case.
1831000	1834000	The game is called Earthquake and Zipland
1834000	1839000	and it deals with a king and queen who are suddenly separated by
1839000	1844000	when this giant zipper that's held the two parts of the small island together
1844000	1851000	has come apart and then your main character tries and tries and tries to
1851000	1856000	fix the island and combine them to bring the king and queen back together.
1856000	1857000	But spoiler alert!
1857000	1858000	They don't.
1858000	1860000	And there's no way that he can.
1860000	1862000	So there you go.
1862000	1864000	No way you can fix a marriage.
1864000	1867000	You might as well throw yourself into the ocean and die.
1867000	1868000	Does the game tell you that, too?
1868000	1869000	That's really pleasant.
1869000	1871000	No, but that's where I took from it.
1871000	1873000	I could be wrong, but, you know.
1873000	1874000	Oh, okay.
1874000	1878000	But then again, I'm not a 12-year-old that's played this game.
1878000	1881000	I'm neither of those.
1881000	1885000	Dark Soccer, do you think we need a game to help kids understand divorce?
1885000	1887000	Um, no.
1887000	1889000	People just shouldn't get married.
1889000	1890000	They should have an expo.
1890000	1891000	Seriously, think about it.
1891000	1896000	If, like, there was, like, no marriage, you know, none at all,
1896000	1900000	and everybody, you know, was just like, you know, had, like, common law deal
1900000	1905000	or, you know, then there wouldn't be a problem.
1905000	1908000	Oh, well, Daddy decided that he and Mommy were going to break up,
1908000	1910000	so he just moved out.
1910000	1912000	No problem.
1912000	1915000	They should find out that the reason that the island split in two
1915000	1918000	is because the king was having sex with some other chick.
1918000	1923000	Daddy's moving in with Uncle Bob.
1923000	1928000	I personally, I basically, my parents were divorced, you know,
1928000	1931000	before I had any memory of them being married.
1931000	1938000	So I, from that point of view, I couldn't really say if a game would help with that
1938000	1941000	because I just always grew up understanding what divorce was.
1941000	1944000	Seriously, my parents have been together ever since, you know, I was born.
1944000	1946000	They were together for, like, you know, 15 years before I was born,
1946000	1949000	and they're still together today, and I need a game to help me understand
1949000	1952000	why they're still together after all these years.
1952000	1957000	What I don't get is why people who obviously hate each other's fucking guts,
1957000	1959000	oh, we're staying together for the kids.
1959000	1963000	Meanwhile, you're giving them a fucking complex because you hate each other.
1963000	1965000	Why does Mommy and Daddy fight?
1965000	1967000	Why do they hate each other?
1967000	1970000	You would all be happier if you'd just go ahead and get a divorce.
1970000	1972000	Well, I'm sure we'll be getting some e-mails on that one.
1972000	1973000	Mailbag.
1973000	1975000	I don't believe in staying together for the children.
1975000	1979000	I believe in giving the children a healthier environment to exist in.
1979000	1980000	All right.
1980000	1983000	Well, we'll see what kind of Pandora's Box that comment opens.
1983000	1986000	I grew up just fine with my divorced parents, okay?
1986000	1987000	All right.
1987000	1988000	We'll see what happens.
1988000	1990000	All right, anyway, we're going to see what happens with this, too.
1990000	1992000	It's our Website of the Week.
1992000	1997000	DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet every which way she possibly can every week,
1997000	2000000	and she finds a website suitable to share with the rest of you,
2000000	2003000	or in this week's case it may be a little bit unsuitable.
2003000	2004000	We shall see.
2004000	2007000	It's DarkSakura's website, what?
2007000	2010000	I heard about this site from you a long time ago.
2010000	2016000	Don't say that because it's not in the proper context here.
2016000	2018000	You're not giving it the proper context.
2018000	2021000	You heard about it from me on a radio program a couple years ago.
2021000	2023000	La, la, la, la, la.
2023000	2025000	Just play me my damn music.
2025000	2033000	I'm going to go run and hide.
2033000	2041000	The Website of the Week, again, is one that Rob mentioned a long time ago.
2041000	2046000	Mantis.net.
2046000	2047000	Sorry.
2047000	2053000	Mantis are panties made for men, and they're frilly and lacy,
2053000	2055000	and you can get them high cut.
2055000	2062000	You can get briefs, and you can get nylon or lace,
2062000	2066000	and they have all kinds of designs, and they have seven day ones,
2066000	2068000	and they're really pretty,
2068000	2073000	and plus they're made spacious in the front for special needs of men.
2073000	2078000	So, guys, if you want to be pretty,
2078000	2081000	if you feel like being a little dressier than usual,
2081000	2092000	you should go to mantis.net.
2092000	2097000	Chat room, the answer to your question is no.
2097000	2100000	That would be no.
2100000	2103000	That's so wrong.
2103000	2107000	I feel dirty.
2107000	2114000	But you can still feel dirty yet pretty underneath, and no one knows but you.
2114000	2116000	It's a great idea.
2116000	2120000	I'm looking at the embroidered ones, and they have hearts on them or balloons.
2120000	2125000	Hey, PowerShot Pinball Constructor is coming out for the Nintendo DS.
2125000	2130000	Oxygen Games just announced this coming out very soon,
2130000	2133000	because Metroid Prime Pinball did pretty well, so here we go.
2133000	2135000	PowerShot Pinball Constructor.
2135000	2138000	So I guess it sounds like you can make your own table in this game,
2138000	2139000	which sounds kind of cool.
2139000	2141000	Yeah, it has a table editor in it,
2141000	2145000	and of course that makes me think of pinball construction set on the Commodore 64.
2145000	2147000	Pinball is fucking awesome.
2147000	2149000	So now you can make your own table.
2149000	2152000	So that means if I wanted to make a table of nothing but like 50 bumpers,
2152000	2154000	I could do that.
2154000	2156000	Do you remember the hyperball machine, though?
2156000	2158000	All it was was nothing but multiball.
2158000	2159000	Oh, I don't remember that.
2159000	2160000	It would just shoot out a bunch of balls,
2160000	2162000	and you'd have to shoot them back down on the thing.
2162000	2164000	If I wanted to build pinball machines,
2164000	2168000	I would get Dan to buy one and fix it for me.
2168000	2172000	All right, well, now you can do it on the palm of your hand on the DS.
2172000	2174000	There you go.
2174000	2181000	Anyways, so Zelda co-creator Eiji Aonuma,
2181000	2184000	confirmed in an interview with Game Informer
2184000	2193000	that Phantom Hourglass for the DS will feature an online multiplayer mode,
2193000	2195000	and they didn't really see what it's going to feature,
2195000	2198000	but he did answer yes when they asked
2198000	2202000	if there was going to be online battles over the Nintendo Wi-Fi service.
2202000	2206000	So that's interesting, I guess.
2206000	2209000	Maybe I'm thinking it's going to be something like Four Swords, maybe.
2209000	2211000	That would be kind of neat.
2211000	2212000	I don't know.
2212000	2214000	That would be pretty cool.
2214000	2217000	Four Swords was actually a really, really cool game.
2217000	2220000	Four Swords was a much fun game on the GameCube.
2220000	2221000	That game was awesome.
2221000	2224000	When you could find people that had the advances and the cords
2224000	2227000	to play the damn game with, it was a fun game.
2227000	2229000	I thought I heard...
2229000	2231000	Now, I can't remember...
2231000	2232000	Correct me if I'm wrong,
2232000	2234000	because I never played Four Swords Adventure or something like that.
2234000	2237000	Did it have an online mode or something where someone...
2237000	2240000	There's a couple tri-forces on the map or something like that.
2240000	2243000	I think we talked about this maybe last week,
2243000	2247000	where you basically drew a path that this warrior thing follows or something.
2247000	2251000	That's the multiplayer in the Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
2251000	2252000	Oh, okay.
2252000	2253000	Yeah.
2253000	2256000	I think that was Bobby telling us about him playing it at GDC.
2256000	2257000	That's right.
2257000	2258000	That's what he was saying.
2258000	2259000	That's what we were hanging out with him last week.
2259000	2260000	Yeah.
2260000	2262000	Anyways, so as Bobby was telling us from GDC,
2262000	2266000	it's basically there's a couple tri-forces on the map,
2266000	2272000	and you can't, I think, see the player if they have a tri-force
2272000	2274000	or don't have a tri-force, something like that.
2274000	2278000	Basically, one player controls the three guards,
2278000	2281000	and you draw a path that they follow and stuff like that.
2281000	2282000	It sounds interesting.
2282000	2287000	It's kind of like that Pac-Man multiplayer game that was on the GameCube.
2287000	2291000	Pac-Man Versus, which they so need on the Wii and online.
2291000	2294000	Or on Xbox Live then, because if Nintendo's not going to do it,
2294000	2297000	then fucking put Pac-Man Versus on Xbox Live.
2297000	2299000	That's what we should have gotten instead of old-school Pac-Man,
2299000	2301000	but that's just my opinion.
2301000	2302000	Yeah.
2302000	2304000	What do I know?
2304000	2305000	I don't know, Rob.
2305000	2306000	What do you know?
2306000	2308000	How about some stuff?
2308000	2309000	I know stuff.
2309000	2311000	There is a little bit of information, though.
2311000	2316000	I know I'm not visiting your website of the week this week.
2316000	2317000	Rob.
2317000	2319000	Yeah?
2319000	2327000	So there is an unholy union between In the Groove and Pump It Up.
2327000	2332000	It's like they got together after taking a lot of LSD and bread.
2332000	2337000	So now there's a Pump It Up Pro.
2337000	2338000	Yeah.
2338000	2340000	I'm not going to say anything else about that.
2340000	2342000	God, where do I begin?
2342000	2347000	A, those of you that were saying that In the Groove was going to somehow be absorbed into Konami
2347000	2349000	and Dance Dance Revolution.
2349000	2350000	No.
2350000	2351000	Was going to have In the Groove songs.
2351000	2352000	No.
2352000	2354000	And here's further proof that that ain't happening,
2354000	2356000	because it's been absorbed into Pump It Up, it looks like.
2356000	2360000	It's pretty much all the songs that were done by Kyle Ward are now on Pump It Up.
2360000	2361000	That's about it.
2361000	2365000	So in other words, Andy Mero threw a bunch of money at Kyle Ward, and that's it?
2365000	2370000	Because Andy Mero, but Andy Mero and Roxor had, I guess, a working relationship, right?
2370000	2374000	Because those In the Groove 2 cabinets, of which I've still never seen one in my entire life,
2374000	2376000	were made, well wait, I take that back.
2376000	2380000	There might have been one at that 8 on the Break place in Jersey when I went there a long time ago.
2380000	2381000	I can't remember.
2381000	2385000	But regardless, Andy Mero made those cabinets for him, right?
2385000	2387000	Yeah, I think so.
2387000	2390000	So they already had a little bit of a working relationship.
2390000	2393000	So this actually doesn't surprise me so much.
2393000	2398000	Yeah, you're going to see songs like, for example, Oasis, as well as,
2398000	2403000	there's a bunch of other stuff I recognized on there when I was watching the videos of them.
2403000	2410000	Exotica, Esperanza, let's see here, Destiny.
2410000	2415000	It was a bunch of songs, I think, from In the Groove that were in there.
2415000	2418000	I mean, don't get me wrong, I like some of Kyle Ward's songs.
2418000	2422000	I really like the stuff he does under, what is it, Bonsai is the name?
2422000	2425000	The Zodiac and Anubis and all those songs.
2425000	2429000	But still, I don't know, it's just weird.
2429000	2433000	And I know, like, Miggletove wanted to come on the show tonight, but he had to leave.
2433000	2435000	I know he's a hardcore Pump It Up fan.
2435000	2436000	He ain't happy about this.
2436000	2437000	Zodiac?
2437000	2441000	Is the In the Groove thing crossing over to Pump It Up?
2441000	2443000	I don't think it's really crossing over.
2443000	2446000	I think it's more of just they have him now as an artist, and that's it.
2446000	2448000	So he's taking his songs with them.
2448000	2451000	I mean, the guy's got to work, so whatever.
2451000	2455000	That doesn't necessarily mean he's just, you know, it's In the Groove now.
2455000	2458000	They did, I like what they've done with the interface.
2458000	2461000	The interface is not retarded as it usually is on Pump.
2461000	2463000	So that's kind of nice.
2463000	2467000	But other than that, I don't really think it's In the Groove.
2467000	2472000	It's just that it's got, you know, Kyle Ward doing music for him.
2472000	2474000	Great.
2474000	2476000	Well, I think what's great about this is it just proves us right,
2476000	2479000	that those songs were not going to be ever showing up in DDR.
2479000	2480000	Yeah.
2480000	2484000	In the Groove, DDR, right.
2484000	2486000	Alrighty.
2486000	2491000	Let's see, if you would like to call us, we're going to open up the Skype line here very shortly,
2491000	2493000	because we encourage your interaction here on this program as well.
2493000	2498000	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and our 800 number,
2498000	2501000	if you want to call us that way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2501000	2504000	It looks like we have some In on the Break fans or folks that live near there.
2504000	2506000	Blaze says, 8 on the Break for the win.
2506000	2509000	DDR Dollar Bill says, yeah, 8 on the Break.
2509000	2511000	Rama says, Sky, that was a beta In the Groove 2.
2511000	2515000	Chinatown Fair has In the Groove 2 and a Pump It Up box.
2515000	2518000	So yeah, I went to 8 on the, I've been to 8 on the Break.
2518000	2520000	I want to say I've been there a couple times, actually.
2520000	2523000	I think I went out there once randomly when I was on the East Coast.
2523000	2526000	I went there again for some DDR tournament.
2526000	2532000	And I played some game that was some beat game I'd never seen in my life.
2532000	2534000	I don't remember, sorry.
2534000	2537000	Let's see, Shadow Charlie wants to know what happened.
2537000	2540000	Speaking of Zodiac, what happened to the Zodiac remix that Loki made
2540000	2542000	that was during the bonus segment of last week's show?
2542000	2544000	Check his community page on all games.
2544000	2546000	It's there.
2546000	2548000	And apparently 8 on the Break has 2 In the Groove 2 machines now.
2548000	2549000	There you have it.
2549000	2552000	All right, let's go ahead and head on over to the Skype line
2552000	2554000	and start taking some calls.
2554000	2557000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
2557000	2560000	Ravenstaufen. Let me turn down the thing.
2560000	2563000	All right, hi, Ravenstaufen. What's on your mind?
2563000	2565000	I got a podcast now.
2565000	2567000	You have a podcast now?
2567000	2568000	Mm-hmm.
2568000	2571000	Oh, God, everybody and their fucking mom has a podcast now.
2571000	2573000	Why should we listen to yours?
2573000	2576000	Because it's a tech podcast, Sky.
2576000	2577000	Something different.
2577000	2579000	It's a tech podcast.
2579000	2582000	This Week in Ravenstaufen?
2582000	2583000	Sort of.
2583000	2585000	What's it called?
2585000	2587000	It's called RavenstechReview.
2587000	2590000	All right, and where can we access RavenstechReview?
2590000	2592000	On the All Games forums.
2592000	2594000	And it's being submitted to iTunes soon.
2594000	2595000	Hope it's going to be up there.
2595000	2596000	All right, we'll see.
2596000	2598000	Hopefully coming soon to the iTunes store.
2598000	2600000	Well, Raven, talk games with us because we don't...
2600000	2602000	Well, I mean, we do talk tech, but we talk video games.
2602000	2604000	What did you think of some of our stories tonight?
2604000	2607000	I think they're interesting, but you're missing one more.
2607000	2608000	And I viewed it on my site.
2608000	2609000	I'm sorry.
2609000	2612000	It's the Commodore computer coming back.
2612000	2613000	I didn't...
2613000	2614000	Because I think we hit...
2614000	2615000	We talked about it last week.
2615000	2616000	Yeah, we talked about it last week.
2616000	2617000	That's why.
2617000	2618000	Oh, yeah, you did?
2618000	2619000	Yeah, we did.
2619000	2620000	Yeah, that's all right.
2620000	2621000	What do you think?
2621000	2625000	As a tech-inclined individual, what do you think of Commodore making a comeback in the,
2625000	2628000	I don't know, competing with Alienware or something market?
2628000	2631000	I think it's interesting.
2631000	2634000	I don't know if it's going to be an operating system.
2634000	2637000	You remember the Commodore had a different operating system than the DOS.
2637000	2638000	Right.
2638000	2639000	So I don't know what they're going to do.
2639000	2644000	I don't know if it's going to be Commodore just placed in there with a Windows operating system,
2644000	2647000	or they're going to go with something different.
2647000	2648000	But it's interesting.
2648000	2651000	Something tells me, since Commodore BASIC is very antiquated,
2651000	2656000	I think you're going to just get a normal Windows PC in there.
2656000	2658000	I was just interesting about that.
2658000	2664000	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to miss syntax error one bit or load quote star quote comma eight comma one.
2664000	2667000	I ain't going to miss that shit.
2667000	2670000	I don't miss it at all, but two more things.
2670000	2673000	The fuck did comma eight comma one mean anyway?
2673000	2674000	I have no idea.
2674000	2675000	Two more things.
2675000	2676000	It was just their command line.
2676000	2678000	I think it was like the device number or something.
2678000	2680000	Well, why was the disk drive eight?
2680000	2681000	It was always eight.
2681000	2684000	I think like once in a blue moon you might have seven.
2684000	2688000	But anyway, sorry.
2688000	2692000	This would be This Week in Raven from 1984.
2692000	2694000	You have to listen to it.
2694000	2696000	What else is on your mind, Raven?
2696000	2697000	Two more things on my mind.
2697000	2700000	Vampire for the Commodore 64.
2700000	2702000	You ever played Vampire?
2702000	2706000	I'm familiar with the title, but I can't remember the game play.
2706000	2707000	Fun game.
2707000	2708000	It's on game tab.
2708000	2709000	I was going to say, I think it's on game tab.
2709000	2710000	I think that's where I've seen it.
2710000	2712000	I have not played it.
2712000	2715000	What do you do in Vampire?
2715000	2717000	And don't say you're a vampire.
2717000	2718000	I am not a vampire.
2718000	2720000	No, I meant in the game.
2720000	2722000	This one goes to Dark Soccer.
2722000	2724000	What?
2724000	2725000	Flintstones Pinball.
2725000	2727000	You ever heard of it?
2727000	2728000	I think so.
2728000	2730000	I don't think I was very interested in it.
2730000	2731000	Was it based off the movie?
2731000	2732000	Yeah, it was.
2732000	2735000	I played that table once, and because it was the movie,
2735000	2741000	it felt like I felt unclean after playing it.
2741000	2746000	And I had to go change out of my manties.
2746000	2747000	Alright.
2747000	2748000	Bye Raven's Dolphin.
2748000	2750000	Take care.
2750000	2755000	Alright, if you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR,
2755000	2758000	or you can always call us on the Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio.
2758000	2761000	Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.
2761000	2763000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2763000	2765000	Who's this?
2765000	2769000	I'll give you three guesses, and the first letters are J, A, and S.
2769000	2771000	Oh, it's Jazz.
2771000	2773000	God, you haven't been on the show in a long time.
2773000	2774000	No.
2774000	2775000	Hi, Jason.
2775000	2776000	What's on your mind?
2776000	2778000	You have to fail at spelling, Rob.
2778000	2779000	Jeez.
2779000	2785000	Mr. VX JasonXV himself, our webmaster extraordinaire.
2785000	2786000	Extraordinaire.
2786000	2790000	Hey, VX, our website held up amongst being on the front page
2790000	2794000	of Dig and Joystiq and Kotaku and all that stuff,
2794000	2796000	Destructoid and all that this week.
2796000	2797000	So, good job.
2797000	2798000	Really good to know.
2798000	2800000	I've kept looking, and I've kept checking.
2800000	2803000	I saw when you guys rumen always upsell.
2803000	2804000	Crazy shit.
2804000	2808000	Well, what do we owe this phone call to tonight?
2808000	2812000	I would love a new Space Quest game.
2812000	2813000	Who wouldn't?
2813000	2815000	I would absolutely love it.
2815000	2819000	But do you think it's actually going to happen?
2819000	2820000	I don't know.
2820000	2821000	Haven't kept up.
2821000	2823000	I just heard it, and I thought it was cool.
2823000	2826000	How many games are in the Space Quest franchise?
2826000	2828000	I can't remember.
2828000	2829000	Six.
2829000	2830000	Wow.
2830000	2832000	So there were that many games in the Space Quest series?
2832000	2835000	I always thought there was only the three or four that were in it.
2835000	2836000	Wow.
2836000	2837000	There was.
2837000	2840000	The first four were all the keyboard navigational.
2840000	2842000	The fifth actually introduced the mouse,
2842000	2845000	and then the sixth actually introduced the announcer
2845000	2846000	and even more interactivity.
2846000	2847000	Five was awesome.
2847000	2849000	That's the first one I played.
2849000	2851000	I got the anthology and played the old ones,
2851000	2854000	and then I played six, and I was blown away
2854000	2858000	because it was a big difference, and it was so good.
2858000	2865000	For the kids today who may have never played Space Quest in the past,
2865000	2869000	what makes this game so frickin' great?
2869000	2870000	Humor.
2870000	2873000	You have to read, but it's all in the humor,
2873000	2875000	and it's a great puzzle game.
2875000	2878000	All right.
2878000	2879000	Let's see.
2879000	2881000	We out?
2881000	2883000	I was just saying that's the best part about it.
2883000	2884000	It is a funny game.
2884000	2885000	It is very witty.
2885000	2886000	It's great to read.
2886000	2889000	It is a game that puts you through a book adventure,
2889000	2890000	and I loved it.
2890000	2891000	All right.
2891000	2895000	Well, I hope Vivendi, Sierra, whoever hears your calls,
2895000	2897000	and maybe will come out with something new,
2897000	2901000	but don't hold your breath.
2901000	2902000	Yeah.
2902000	2903000	All right.
2903000	2904000	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
2904000	2905000	I believe so.
2905000	2908000	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
2908000	2912000	I beat Turtles Arcade at five o'clock in the morning.
2912000	2913000	Good job.
2913000	2916000	Were you by yourself, or did you have a bunch of other people?
2916000	2917000	I was by myself.
2917000	2920000	Oh, but you get unlimited continues by yourself.
2920000	2923000	How many continues did you have to use?
2923000	2925000	Oh, I don't even know.
2925000	2930000	Call me back and brag when it's three or less, buddy.
2930000	2931000	All right.
2931000	2932000	Just teasing.
2932000	2933000	Congratulations.
2933000	2934000	It's fine.
2934000	2936000	You know, actually, there's a YouTube I saw somewhere
2936000	2939000	of a guy running through the entire game on one credit.
2939000	2941000	It was amazing.
2941000	2944000	I don't know how anyone does it.
2944000	2947000	A lot of people claim about, you know, single credit arcade runs,
2947000	2951000	and I know I don't have any game I could say I've done such a thing with.
2951000	2953000	Me neither.
2953000	2954000	All right.
2954000	2955000	All right, Jason.
2955000	2956000	Well, thanks for all you do for us,
2956000	2959000	and we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, all righty?
2959000	2960000	Sweet.
2960000	2961000	Later.
2961000	2962000	Have a good night.
2962000	2963000	You too.
2963000	2964000	All right.
2964000	2967000	If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR, remember it's your show, too.
2967000	2969000	We want to hear what you guys have to say.
2969000	2973000	So let's go to another call here on the Skype line.
2973000	2974000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2974000	2976000	Who's this?
2976000	2978000	Hey, this is Darkshi.
2978000	2980000	Hi, Darkshi?
2980000	2981000	Yeah.
2981000	2982000	Ah, Darkshi.
2982000	2984000	What's on your mind, my friend?
2984000	2985000	First I want to say it's kind of amazing.
2985000	2987000	It's the first time on the air.
2987000	2990000	I was going to say I don't recognize your name as calling in before.
2990000	2992000	I know your name from chat, but you've never called in before,
2992000	2995000	so welcome, noob.
2995000	2997000	What's on your mind?
2997000	3004000	Well, first off, I just saw 300 today, and I heard of a game coming out.
3004000	3009000	And my friend's all, so I saw, like, oh, it should be on PS3.
3009000	3011000	It's so amazing it deserves to be on PS3.
3011000	3013000	And I've never heard of it.
3013000	3015000	Like, what?
3015000	3020000	It does sound a little bit like a fanboy's wet dream such as Kill Bill the game.
3020000	3023000	If there's any game that's slated to come out, Loki would know about it.
3023000	3024000	300?
3024000	3025000	Are they really making a game out of 300?
3025000	3029000	Yeah, they did a PSP game, and it wasn't very good.
3029000	3031000	Oh, so there is a PSP game, huh?
3031000	3032000	Yeah.
3032000	3033000	What do you do in the PSP game?
3033000	3035000	You just hack and slash type stuff.
3035000	3037000	Put your ears through people's faces and all that fun stuff?
3037000	3038000	I guess.
3038000	3042000	It didn't give very good reviews, and it came out a couple weeks ago, last week in February.
3042000	3047000	So, but you say your friend said it should come out on PS3.
3047000	3051000	Yeah, he said, like, oh, it's such a great game, and he's a PS3 fanboy.
3051000	3053000	He wants every single game.
3053000	3057000	Did he not get his PSP and his PS3 confused, maybe?
3057000	3060000	Because we don't know of its existence on PlayStation 3.
3060000	3064000	I told him, like, he said it deserves to be on PS3.
3064000	3066000	He's saying, like, oh, it's so amazing.
3066000	3070000	At the same time, the PS3 wasn't all that great.
3070000	3072000	Well, you know, I think the movie's been doing very well.
3072000	3075000	It was at the top of the box office again the second week in a row.
3075000	3078000	I think it's inevitable you're going to see a sequel to 300 at some point.
3078000	3080000	Well, can you do a sequel to 300?
3080000	3082000	I guess not, because it's based on history, huh?
3082000	3084000	It's based on a comic series.
3084000	3086000	Oh, is it? Well, then there might, I guess, who knows?
3086000	3089000	I haven't seen it. I'm not on the 300 fan wagon.
3089000	3092000	I don't know if it's just one novel thing or something.
3092000	3096000	Well, we'll see. So maybe, if possible, they'll have a sequel later on.
3096000	3098000	Otherwise, you'll see something like it.
3098000	3101000	And who knows? Again, if it's tied into comics and they do more comics,
3101000	3106000	it could be possible you get another game or two out of this a little later on down the line,
3106000	3109000	especially with the movie being as popular as it is.
3109000	3113000	Yeah, yeah. And I have one more thing.
3113000	3115000	Sure. What's up?
3115000	3120000	All right. I remember so, so many years ago about hearing about Phantom Hourglass,
3120000	3124000	and it just came out now, or coming out now,
3124000	3127000	and I'm like, is this like a tradition for the Zelda games or something?
3127000	3129000	Yes.
3129000	3131000	Pretty much, sadly. Yeah.
3131000	3133000	Phantom Hourglass, they debuted at what?
3133000	3138000	Didn't they first show that off at E305, I almost want to say?
3138000	3140000	Maybe it was E306.
3140000	3144000	It was either E306 or it was either that or Tokyo Game Show or something like that.
3144000	3146000	Yeah, it has been a long time.
3146000	3150000	Yeah, it's pretty much tradition for the Zelda series at this point.
3150000	3155000	Oh, except the CDI ones came out pretty quickly.
3155000	3157000	Just kidding. All right.
3157000	3160000	Well, are you looking forward to Phantom Hourglass?
3160000	3163000	Yeah, I'm a big fan of Zelda.
3163000	3165000	I don't own every game.
3165000	3167000	What do you think about the multiplayer mode we were talking about?
3167000	3170000	Do you think it's going to be fun on the Internet?
3170000	3175000	I'm hoping so, because I can't really think of Zelda online,
3175000	3177000	so maybe they'll surprise me.
3177000	3180000	It's hard to think about Nintendo online these days,
3180000	3185000	but yeah, Zelda's definitely a step in the right direction, so we'll see.
3185000	3186000	Yeah.
3186000	3188000	All right. Well, Darkside, thank you so much for the call,
3188000	3190000	and call again sometime, all right?
3190000	3191000	All right.
3191000	3193000	Later.
3193000	3197000	Have fun with Phantom Hourglass and all those hours you're going to be putting into that.
3197000	3200000	All right, I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
3200000	3202000	Sorry to those folks that did not get through.
3202000	3207000	We apologize, but everybody's trying to hammer the line there, so it happens.
3207000	3211000	Let's see, going to the chat room, trying to read the comments there
3211000	3214000	to some of those previous calls we took.
3214000	3219000	SSJ100Matt says, I hear the 300 game is awful.
3219000	3223000	GS68 says, bring on the max 300 jokes.
3223000	3229000	Let's see, SSJ100Matt says you could have 302 electric boogaloo.
3229000	3231000	All right, there you have it.
3231000	3233000	We'll take more calls next week.
3233000	3236000	Of course, again, Loki's challenge to leave us a dirty joke on the Skype line,
3236000	3239000	that's open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3239000	3241000	You can do that all week long.
3241000	3244000	I'm going to go around and see if there's any last-minute stories
3244000	3248000	anybody would like to share tonight, last-minute stories.
3248000	3253000	I've been trying to find the information on it, but I can't actually find it.
3253000	3257000	There's actually a new pinball table coming out later this year
3257000	3261000	that's a Monty Python theme, and we're actually going to get it.
3261000	3263000	Like a Spamalot table?
3263000	3266000	I don't know if it's Spamalot, because there's already a Holy Grail table.
3266000	3269000	I thought that they were either going to do Meaning of Life or Life of Brian.
3269000	3271000	I think it's Meaning of Life.
3271000	3273000	I think that's pretty cool.
3273000	3275000	Always look on the bright side.
3275000	3276000	That was Life of Brian.
3276000	3277000	Yeah, I know, but you know.
3277000	3282000	Meaning of Life had the...
3282000	3285000	It's just a way for thin mint.
3285000	3289000	Wasn't Meaning of Life the one that was in the office building in the beginning?
3289000	3292000	That was actually a different...
3292000	3295000	It was supposed to be a lot shorter,
3295000	3298000	but unfortunately they let Terry Gilliam have his way,
3298000	3301000	and it was the...
3301000	3304000	What was it? The Crimson something assurance?
3304000	3306000	I remember that scene going on forever.
3306000	3308000	All forever a scene went on.
3308000	3310000	I love that scene.
3310000	3311000	Anyhow.
3311000	3314000	Isn't it great to charter an accountant?
3314000	3315000	That one.
3315000	3317000	The Rob D. says about the Monty Python table,
3317000	3321000	every time you hit a bumper, I fart in your general direction.
3321000	3323000	Every time you hit a bumper.
3323000	3324000	That's cute.
3324000	3328000	And now for something completely different.
3328000	3329000	Monty Python pinball table.
3329000	3331000	That's a good name for a table.
3331000	3333000	Loki, anything from you?
3333000	3335000	Just a couple small things.
3335000	3337000	One, Splatterhouse is supposed to be...
3337000	3341000	is confirmed apparently for Virtual Console this Monday.
3341000	3343000	So we're going to be seeing that.
3343000	3344000	I'm going to tell you right now,
3344000	3346000	Splatterhouse is one of those games
3346000	3347000	you're going to think back to your childhood and go,
3347000	3348000	this game was awesome,
3348000	3350000	but when you all downloaded on Monday,
3350000	3352000	the game was not that good.
3352000	3354000	It really wasn't.
3354000	3356000	I remember how bad it was.
3356000	3357000	But it's still funny though.
3357000	3361000	If you want that Friday the 13th vibe to it.
3361000	3363000	There you go.
3363000	3365000	Let's see what else here.
3365000	3369000	Oh, apparently it started now on the PlayStation 3
3369000	3372000	on one of the previous firmwares.
3372000	3379000	Up until 1.51, they're seeing holes
3379000	3382000	and they've exploited a TIFF exploit,
3382000	3386000	basically causing a buffer overflow like they did on the PSP
3386000	3389000	to run their own code.
3389000	3394000	So it's only a matter of time before they break the PlayStation 3
3394000	3397000	and have piracy rampant on there as well as homebrew and stuff.
3397000	3401000	So I'm waiting.
3401000	3402000	That's it.
3402000	3403000	All right.
3403000	3405000	And I don't have anything either.
3405000	3408000	So I guess we're here to the end of the show.
3408000	3409000	So that's it.
3409000	3411000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
3411000	3412000	I'll start.
3412000	3413000	Loki, Loki, your final thought.
3413000	3416000	My final thought is...
3416000	3418000	I think I have some good games on Virtual Console.
3418000	3421000	I haven't bought anything lately.
3421000	3425000	My final thought is Moonkin Forum is only 15,000 experience away.
3425000	3426000	Woot.
3426000	3428000	And I'm a wow addict.
3428000	3430000	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3430000	3432000	We're finishing pretty fucking early.
3432000	3434000	Yeah, this is the short show tonight.
3434000	3436000	It's kind of weird for us, but that's okay.
3436000	3438000	It's been a compact and good show, a lot of information.
3438000	3440000	We talked about it a lot in part A and part B.
3440000	3442000	We'll do it all again next week.
3442000	3444000	In the meantime, thank you guys so much for tuning into
3444000	3446000	and supporting independent internet radio.
3446000	3448000	You guys are awesome, and it's because of you,
3448000	3451000	we continue to do this show every week in and week out.
3451000	3453000	So we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio,
3453000	3457000	March the 25th for episode number 225.
3457000	3458000	Is that like a landmark number?
3458000	3461000	Because it's like a multiple of 25.
3461000	3462000	I don't know.
3462000	3463000	Not so much.
3463000	3464000	All right.
3464000	3465000	250 maybe.
3465000	3466000	250 maybe.
3466000	3468000	Or our five-year birthday is just around the corner.
3468000	3469000	I say we get a stripper for the fifth birthday.
3469000	3470000	We'll see.
3470000	3471000	All right.
3471000	3473000	Anyhow, in the meantime, that's it for this week.
3473000	3475000	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
3475000	3478000	Tune in next week to find out which website calls us a liar next.
3478000	3479000	That'll be fun.
