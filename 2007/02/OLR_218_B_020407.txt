Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening.
We're taping live on February the 4th of 2007.
Hey, if you want to join us for a live taping sometime, it's Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
And yes, we know there's a big football game that just wrapped up, and folks are probably still at their parties, but here we are, because we're loyal to the show, we love you guys, and we love all of you that are in chat right now, even though there is still that football game, post-game stuff going on, and whatever show is on after it this year, and
and all that stuff going on.
So thank you guys for being loyal and tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
Who's starting us off in the next segment here?
Well, apparently there's news that Sony was basically saying... A spokesman from Sony, Dave... His name sounds like Cracker.
Craker, I guess.
He was quoted... They were talking about the whole, you know, format wars and stuff and talking about...
PlayStation 3 vs. 360 and stuff.
And then one of the things that they were talking about also was the Nintendo Wii and saying that it wasn't even in the same category as PlayStation 3.
In fact, the Wii could be considered as an impulse buy more than anything else.
Which everyone was like, oh my god, you know, that's so crazy that he would say that, but I don't really think that's a...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Is the Wii an impulse buy?
Well, tell me what average person just happens to have, you know, 350 bucks lying around.
You know, usually we have things to pay, like bills.
Or, that's a car payment, you know?
Well, somehow the three of us manage it.
Well, yeah, but we also, you know, if we were responsible about it, planned out that purchase, right?
Right, and I did not budget a PlayStation 3.
So, I didn't buy them.
We budgeted our PlayStation 3, we budgeted our Wii...
I budgeted the Wii, but I did not budget a PlayStation 3, which is why I don't have one.
I had to have mine three days early, so... And JV Mon in our chatroom comes back with the classic, Your mom is an impulse buy.
That was pretty funny.
That's why I said JV Mon.
Last night!
Anyhow.
And TheRobD says, That's what happens when it's at a lower price than $599 US dollars.
It's a little easier to be in it.
It has more than 15 games.
Well, I'm...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's not downloading new content for me.
All it's doing is sending me messages that I can download some more content.
Fucking where is this automatic downloading shit?
It's there for the purpose of illuminating your living room in a blue glow.
Nintendo does not like to come out swinging with their stuff.
Haven't you noticed this about them?
They don't like to reveal all the secrets of their consoles.
Like look at what happened with the DS.
No one knew that thing would have voice thing over the internet or even have internet play at all.
I mean, it was kind of hinted at, but never was that announced.
But Nintendo, for whatever reason, chooses to roll this out slowly.
Xbox 360, they come out swinging.
They lay their cock out on the table and say, thwack, here you go.
It's all right here.
I mean, that's really a fundamental difference between Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo is the way they kind of... Even Sony, their online network, there's nothing on there.
Give me something to buy.
Lemmings?
Gran Turismo.
Gran Turismo's free, okay?
But there's still nothing to buy in there.
There's no new demos.
There's PSP download games.
That's completely useless.
Make the PSP download that shit.
Why do I have to have a PlayStation 3 to download this crap?
I mean, the PSP is capable of downloading this stuff to, you know, off the internet.
Or if it's, you know, going to take too long to do that, download it on your PC.
That should be able to be done.
I mean, it probably sells some more of those virtual, you know, those...
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Nothing.
And only one game... Old games.
One game supports Wii Connect 24, and that's Elebits.
And to be honest, I haven't gotten shit from Elebits, you know, on the Wii Connect 24.
Would you like me to send you an Elebit picture for use in Elebits?
I can do this for you, so you'll stop being such a bitch.
No, I don't.
I don't.
But the whole thing, it's just, you know, I thought that this would eliminate the fact of me having to wait to download these updates or, you know, whatever.
It's just, they're not using this shit.
Going back to a very dirty comment I made earlier.
Ranma says, Xbox 360's cock puts a consumer's eye out.
DarkTetsuya says, Rob just likes to say cock.
Who doesn't?
Who doesn't?
You like to say other things.
I like to say all dirty words.
I like to say all types of dirty words.
Who doesn't?
Well, even though we saw that Sony was being cocky in that last story.
Get it?
Cock.
We have Nintendo accepting an award.
The Wii and WarioWare won an International Toy Fair award.
That's pretty cool, except when they said WarioWare won, they spelled it W-E-A-R.
Well, anyway, they won this International Toy Fair award, and they chose the Wii because, quote, encourages playing PC games in groups instead of alone, even though it's
Not really a PC game.
Well, that's a whole other story.
Also, quote, the product not only appeals to player types with an affinity to PCs, but also to new age groups.
Making it sound like I'm going to like, you know, take herbs.
They're talking out of their ass.
I think it's just these folks, you know, they don't really deal with gaming every day.
So it's, you know.
They're used to giving awards to like Tickle Me Elmo.
So I think that's kind of what makes this newsworthy is that the Wii has kind of jumped that boundary as becoming recognition as a toy in general and not just a gaming system.
Kind of interesting.
I don't know.
I still don't think they get it.
But I think this is pretty cool information though.
Atari Europe is announcing a Godzilla game for the Wii.
And I'm sorry for the...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and are aiming for the title of King of All Monsters.
It should be Queen, Godzilla's female.
She laid eggs.
Sorry.
Anyway, but it's a game that you basically work the storyline as you progress.
I think that's pretty cool.
Very dynamic.
Especially given that you're using the Wii controller for it.
Well, I'm glad to see Rampage is coming out over there.
Yes.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
Am I getting the finger?
Oh.
Mothra wouldn't use shit.
Usually when it's silent, I'm getting the finger.
Would Mothra just fly up into space and fly into the sun because moths are, you know, attracted to fire?
Moths are stupid.
That's a dumb... Why the hell would they create a moth, you know, monster anyways?
That is the dumbest thing ever.
But Gamera was cool.
Gamera is really neat.
FlyingTurtle.
The last time I played a Godzilla game was the old-ass NES game.
The Super NES game was fucking awesome.
Or was it NES?
I don't remember.
It was NES.
And they had a King of Monsters game, which wasn't really Godzilla, but pretty much.
On Neo Geo.
Anyway.
I forget it.
So, what's kind of interesting, though, and this is, I guess, you know, your random Nintendo game sighting.
They have an Easter egg in their
DS Dictionary thing, because we don't get any actual non-games over here, but apparently, if you look up the word for ball, you can actually find, it says one of two translations in the dictionary, one of them that's grayed out.
If you click on the grayed out one, it brings up the Game & Watch game, Ball, so you get to play that.
Kind of a little Easter egg that's thrown in there.
Oh, hooray, I love Ball.
I love Mr. Game & Watch.
Now, of course, a lot of these rumors come from patents and trademark offices, and that's where GoNintendo's getting their idea from.
Nintendo filed a punch-out trademark again in April of 2005, and it was recently updated on January 11th.
Now, who knows if they're just kind of holding on to it, just making sure no one else tries to take the name or whatever they're doing, but certainly when you look at something like Wii Boxing, you can't help but go, it's just a matter of time before this comes out on, you know, punch-out on the...
on the Wii.
It's too bad it won't be Mike Tyson's Punch Out, though.
That would be Mike Tyson's Ear Fest.
Or Mike Tyson's... Never mind.
I'm going to make a really bad joke here.
Let's move on before I get myself in trouble.
You know... I just wanted to say I really love this game.
I love the Nintendo Wii.
I'm sure his Wii... Never mind.
Also, I love Biting Off Ears and Rape.
Now this should make a lot of people very, very happy.
Everyone's favorite luchador, Strong Bad, is on the Wii, kinda.
Our favorite developer, VitElectrics, has created VDeletrics, which is a collection of some of their games that are remastered for Wii Control.
and the quote says the guys at VitElectrics have reworked a few of your favorite games for use on your favorite wave around controller game system.
I think that is great.
You have Strong Bad Zone, Secret Collect, Kid Speedy, More to Come, Population Tire, and More to Come.
You can basically go to your Wii browser to the I guess
It's the VitElectrics page that, of course, is associated with HomestarRunner.com.
But it's V-I-D-E-L-E-C-T-R-I-X dot com slash V-I-I-V-E.
You know, I predicted a while ago Homestar Runner was going to jump the shark and sell out to, like, Cartoon Network, but I guess I've been wrong.
They still have been just kind of trekking along with their web following there.
But now it's interesting to kind of see them tiptoeing into the console games a little bit, you know?
I actually think it's pretty great that this started off as, you know, kind of not that great books for children, and it just turned into this big internet phenomenon.
Yeah.
It just goes to show that good things come to those who wait, right?
We need a Peasants Tale the game on Wii.
So since we've been doing this show five years now, just about, we should be getting those rewards anytime soon now, huh?
Right?
Yeah?
That was funny.
We'll just be right here waiting for you.
La la la la la.
Anyways, other things you can do with your Wii, of course, non-kosher things like modding it.
In fact, there have been three teams that have been releasing their announcements for Wii mod chips.
So, before or not, we're going to have backups and region-free Wiis, which is always good.
Well, the region-free part, at least.
One of these teams, Team Cyclops, they announced their Wii mod chip, which is supposed to be able to play backups of both Wii and GameCube games, GameCube Homebrew, imports of GameCube games, as well as DVD-R and support.
And you're supposed to be able to have it as stealth as well.
One other one that's actually supposed to be coming out pretty soon is called the Wii Key.
And that one's also going to be able to be updated via DVD, so it's supposed to be future-proof, much like the PlayStation 3.
And it's supposed to be able to play backups of both Wii and GameCube games, different region GameCube games and backups, multi-disc games, and etc.
So, you know, this one's actually supposed to start shipping on February 7th, so maybe we'll find out a little bit more of this next week.
Hmm, interesting.
Are you going to order one?
I don't know how to solder for shit, so probably not.
I thought you used to do that.
If you've seen any of my solder jobs, they're awful.
You know somebody who has a very expensive soldering iron who has experience with doing these types of things now?
You?
My hubby.
Oh, yeah, from the pinball stuff.
He fixes his own pinball machines and has put together his main cabinets.
Let's get him to mod your Wii.
Maybe.
All right.
Well, anyhow, one thing that you can do on the Wii, of course, is play old games, which is funny because, you know, most people want to hack them to install emulators on them.
But the Wii has one built in.
But the emulators are not perfect, as folks are finding out this week in downloading Mario Kart 64, because you cannot save ghost data in Mario Kart 64.
And guess what?
Nintendo says, quote, due to unavoidable technical reasons, unfortunately, it is not possible to save ghost data from Mario 64's time trials in the virtual console version of the game.
They did place messages advising users about this before they download the game when the Wii Shop channel is first accessed and in the More Details tab on the individual game page.
And that's true.
I did notice that in the manual.
They're in big red letters.
You can't save ghost data.
I honestly think people are making too big a deal out of this.
I didn't have a memory pack when I owned Mario Kart 64, so I never had ghost data anyway.
I mean, how many people had a Nintendo 64, let alone the memory pack?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Like virtual memory cards on the PlayStation 3.
But you'd be talking about going in and editing Mario Kart 64's game information to do that, because it'd be talking about accessing data a whole other way.
You have to rewrite the game, recompile the game.
Perhaps they could patch it with, I don't know...
Weekend Act 24 that they're not using?
They're not going to do it.
Nintendo says they're not going to do it.
The PC emulators, though, always saved the information.
Well, the ROMs themselves actually have the emulator built into it when you're downloading it, so it wouldn't be that hard for them to fix that.
All they have to do is edit the emulator.
But no.
Yeah, why should they?
Because no one really cares about that shit anyways.
Well, Legend of Zaku agrees and says, ghost data?
Who the fuck uses that?
And that's probably followed up by Boko Fett saying, I love ghost mode.
And Rob D seems to agree they could include a patch with the game.
This is all coming from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Hitstun says, oh, come on, you can't emulate a friggin' controller pack?
NM64 says, Sky, I think you only download the emulator once per system.
I'm not sure on the specifics of that, possibly.
But you see, the thing though is once you've purchased the game, you can delete it and re-download it again.
So if that's the case, they can say, okay, there's an update to this game, please re-download it, and boom, done.
Or I thought WeConnect24 was supposed to do all that automatically.
Right, WeConnect24 is a service that they sell but don't actually fucking use.
But that's not a surprise.
They did the same thing on the DS.
Same thing.
Anyhow.
Yeah, anyhow.
DarkSakura.com
Slim Pickens this week, though, right, DarkSakura?
Not a lot of emails?
Well, we got a bunch of big fat ones.
Oh, there you go.
We like long letters.
Well, one of the emails comes from GS191.
However, I'm not reading the part about Jennifer Strange because, honestly, I'm sick of it.
Although we appreciate the feedback, I think we're all trying to move on from that whole thing.
But thank you for your insight.
And it's pretty much a lot of the same as, you know, what we're thinking.
Yeah.
And there was also the disclaimer that we didn't have... Just because Loki wasn't on a mic, Loki said, we just can't continue to drown ourselves in that information.
It smells like meat in here.
Because he's eating a hamburger and he left the cart open, which you know what that means.
French fries stealing, fries stealing.
I'm going to take like a whole handful.
Here you go.
Hurry up and eat them.
Talk with your mouth full, hurry.
Okay.
I know the flapper map.
Poor GS191.
Gets his email read with fries in our mouth.
I'm the one reading the email.
Okay.
Now the Frapper map, the bane of my existence.
I really don't know what to do.
These are good fries.
They're elephant pie.
They're pretty good.
That one was too salty, though.
Okay.
I really don't know what to do anymore about the Frapper map.
Ever since the switch from Google Maps to Yahoo Maps, the performance of the website has gone down a lot.
We really screwed up the editing to the point that you can go to your forums, you can do that, but it takes out the shoutout listings on the Frapper page.
So you're forced to use their forums if you want to see shoutouts on the page.
Or if you use your own forums, it automatically takes the shoutouts off the page.
Being the administrator of the Frapper map
I'm at a fork in the road.
There are many times that I was so discontent with the map, I almost leave the map and start over again.
The one good thing is that there is an embedded HTML option when I customize the map, so that gives me some hope on getting this to where I like it, and hopefully everyone else does too.
Currently, the map has 141 members, but I know that there is a much larger community out there.
With more support, it will motivate me further, hopefully.
So as of now, I will keep it up, but if the Frapper screws up again, I just don't know what to do.
We'll try to support the Frapper map, and I will do my best to maintain it.
Thank you.
Look at our Frapper map.
It's pretty nice.
I have it up on screen here.
If you want to see it, it's Frapper.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
And there's really nothing to this besides just the fact it's kind of cool to see where our listeners are.
And you notice we have a lot scattered throughout the U.S., but what I'm really noticing a lack of
is the pins over in the UK.
Look at that.
There's like three pins over there.
Come on.
I know we got more listeners than that over there.
And then look, Australia.
If I go over to Australia, there's like a pin.
So we want to especially not that, you know, we love our US listeners.
We want to really see some of our international listeners put a pin in the map somewhere.
But I am going to steal what they do at All Games Interactive.
I am going to replace what's over here.
We're going to put a big map up here.
and we're going to put pins in whenever we get calls and emails from different parts of the world.
We'll have one color for calls and one color for emails.
So we're going to start our own real life Frapper.
But in the meantime, the online one will have to do Frapper.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
And that was a fan created thing.
So thank you to this emailer who created it.
Hugs and kisses.
Well, next email.
Hi, guys.
DDR Dollar Bill here.
Thanks for the updates from Konami Gamers Day, which now made my picking of the newest system very difficult.
This is why.
This weekend I was in the Chinatown section here in New York, and while browsing through the anime, picked up three series I haven't seen yet.
I was also checking out the imports and had some thoughts.
In the past, in order to play imported games, most systems would need to be modified in some fashion.
I can recall back in the cartridge systems where you'd have to buy an adapter to play these games or actually just break open your Super Nintendo.
Yeah, that Super Nintendo one was funny.
Or having your CD, DVD-based systems modified with a mod chip or swap disc or paperclip.
Sorry.
I know that the Game Boy DS systems did not need any modification, which is probably why I enjoyed them the most.
My question is this.
For the systems I did not list that are current are the following true.
Xbox 360, region locked, no safe mod exists, safe as in you will not be banned from Xbox Live.
Wii, region locked, no mod exists yet.
PS3, not region locked on PS3 games, region locked on PS2 games.
PSP, not region locked.
I'm asking this because I'm going to be getting back into purchasing import titles, not just the Ben Mani stuff, but also some of their wrestling games.
which has been more original and fun than the SmackDown vs. Raw and other little oddities such as DONDBZ vs. One Piece vs. Naruto.
I don't care about playing backup copies honestly and I don't want to get one system of each as that would be a waste of money.
I wish they would just let everyone pick and choose what to play regardless of where it's coming from.
Anywho, I could go on for another hour, but I'll leave it like that.
See you guys in the chatroom tonight.
P.S.
I miss free stuff sometimes.
I do believe the PlayStation 3 regions for the game, at least Blu-ray, I know Region 1 is both Japan and the United States.
So, when we talk about importing Japanese games, I think that works.
At least, I don't know about the movies might work, but the games, I'm not sure.
Um, once again, you probably just need to check, maybe, with import sites to deal with that kind of stuff, whether that'll work or not.
360, I know, doesn't.
I'm going to be in San Francisco this weekend, so if I go by Mikado, I can ask them there, since they keep up with all that.
Yeah, I know, because I know they were saying that it is and then it isn't, but I know it's not region-free, but I think that we're in the same region as Japan now.
So... Interesting.
Yeah.
Well, that makes sense, because we're both NTSC.
Well, it's not like it's going to matter for anything in a...
High Definition Format, but I can sort of see it.
SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom says, you can use the GameCube freeloader on the Wii.
Positive, I've seen it done.
I have a freeloader.
But, that's only for GameCube games, that's not for Wii games.
Well, I'm still going to check it out though, I want to try it for myself.
That's pretty cool.
It's really only a matter of time though before anything that is region locked will be unlocked.
Um, I am one of those people who said, I'm not modding my PS2 and went out and bought a JPS2.
So... Ditto.
I did it too.
PlayStation 2 Japanese games do not work on a US PlayStation 2.
Or a PlayStation 3.
And I know somebody in chat, I think Blackboy says PS2 Japanese games work on PlayStation 3, but actually one of the sites had video of trying Kingdom Hearts 2, the import on a PlayStation 3, and it came up with an error message.
So I'm not sure if that's true.
Um...
And the one thing, though, that I am curious about, though, is the freeloader.
If they're going to have... Well, not the freeloader, but what was the one for PlayStation hard drive?
HD loader?
HD loader, that was it.
If they're going to be coming out with something like that.
I'm sure eventually, someday.
But it's still out there for the PlayStation 2s.
If you can find the old style one or even the new style one, you can download the HD loader that actually fits on your memory card.
And then you just plug in a USB drive.
or USB hard drive or something like that.
And it works great for imports.
Well, they even have the thing where you can, you know, I guess it's the same thing.
You download it directly to your hard drive on the system.
I mean, not that we're condoning that eye roll, but, you know, I wonder if they're going to have something like that for PS3 and then that makes the importing...
Or you remember back in the days with the GameCube how they had the whole GD-ROM rip through the VMU unit.
Remember that?
I wonder if they'd be doing something along those lines too.
Just to clarify, it looks like I understand why I misunderstood Blackboy.
He said, I've played Japanese PlayStation 2 games on the Japanese PlayStation 3.
Well, yeah, that'll work.
I thought he meant Japanese PlayStation 2 to US PlayStation 3, and that's what the video was of.
So, oops.
Okay.
Next email, and this comes from Neki, our friend.
Heya OLR, didn't get around to emailing last week, but I got some stuff today.
This is my second time typing this.
Since the first one screwed up, I hope it doesn't happen again.
Check out Attachment 1.
Okay, I didn't actually see there was attachments with this one.
It will show the Wii with over 4 million sales, the 360 with 10 million, and the PS3 with a tiny 1 million.
Owned.
I would just like to give a big shout out towards my home forum site, dscommunity.co.uk.
It's nice and fun, so everyone join the forums.
There's your free shout out.
Oh yeah, and by the way, we are doing a DS tournament on Wednesday starting from, it looks like July 2nd this year at about 7 to 12 p.m.
GMT.
Everyone is welcome, but it would be a good idea to join the forums first, plus we got chat.
Anyway, there's your free plug.
Free plug.
Now, did they plug us on their forums?
That's what I want to know.
Plug us on your forums now, because we're awesome.
Yes, fries.
Rock.
And so, a question for me is where it got the music... Dude, fries.
I'm, like, hungry.
I haven't eaten since those pancakes today.
Jamie, email.
Okay, sorry.
Sorry, Neki.
A question for me was where did it get the music for the show.
I really...
I really want about the FUs of the week, your website of the week, and the show's ending music.
The FUs of the week music is actually from the Final Fantasy VII Advent Children movie.
It's the One Winged Angel.
The big final battle in that movie, yep.
The website of the week music, isn't that Journey to Wonderland?
No, that's the mailbag music is Journey to the Wonderland.
Website of the week is from DDR Ohastas.
That's right.
That's candy.
You can actually dance to that in a Japanese version of DDR.
I've done it.
It's awesome.
The Ohasta is the Ohastation kids version.
It's kind of cute.
Yeah.
What was the Ohaska?
Ohaska.
It's got a lot of cute songs in it.
It's fun.
And our ending show music, Rob knows that one because it's from Beatmania.
Sakura Yamaoka, iFutureList.
Also in DDR Supernova, I believe.
Yep.
The Godly and Studly Akira Yamaoka, who produces Silent Hill now as well.
I was actually watching the making of Silent Hill 3, and he was in it, and he sounded really hoarse.
He's such a rock star.
I met him once, like three years ago.
He was pretty cool.
He was awesome.
I like his business cards.
Anyway, can't think of anything else.
Thanks for the podcast.
Really enjoy it.
Keep it up.
Nike.
P.S.
I found a Doctor Who thing you might get very excited about.
Haven't read it all as it's long.
Doctor Who the game?
Huh.
Why don't we talk about something like that?
Huh.
This is from Bandit.
Hi guys, how's it going?
Been listening to the show for a while and decided to send in an email for a change.
I just wanted to stop and voice an opinion that I've had for a while about moving to the next gen.
Sure, when you look at the shiny new hardware that's out there from the big three, you may want to go out and buy the newest and greatest, but at this point, I've seen a reason to do so yet.
After all of these years of playing games, mostly competitive type games, I've become more of a casual gamer than anything.
I find myself spending more time reading gaming
and use through various online sites than actually playing them.
It was really hard not to just throw down the cash and buy a new console on any of the launches but I had to take a step back and look at what I currently have.
The prime console I own is the PS2.
When I actually took a look back at the games that I've yet to play over the years I realized that purchasing a new console would be a bad idea especially considering the prices of games now.
I've actually never played God of War, Devil May Cry 1 or 3 and many...
and other critically acclaimed titles like these.
There's not enough time in the day to play everything.
I haven't played some of those.
I really missed a lot of great titles on the PS2 by only playing certain games such as Madden and Tekken 5.
Certainly with the case of Tekken 5, I would spend hours learning a character's move list and practicing before visiting a group of the best local players here in Pittsburgh who go by the name of Steel City Tekken.
Believe me, the practice had to be done to stand a chance against them.
Thanks for watching!
The price of one $60 next-gen title.
So if you haven't yet made the commitment to any new next-gen console, I would go as far as to say that the PS2 has one of the two greatest library of games ever on any console.
The original NES will always be first, in my opinion.
Also remember that the PS2 is not dead yet.
We still have Luminous Live, God of War 2, and Final Cut of Kingdom Hearts 2 to play soon.
Since I decided to stick with the PS2 a little longer, I went out and picked up a few games that I missed.
I grabbed Syphon Filter Omega Stream, Devil May Cry Collector's Box Set, and Area 51, not the original that was in the arcades on the PS1 Saturn, for less than $60.
A 5 to 1 game ratio really sounds good to me right now.
I could write much more to prove my point, but I'm sure everyone can see where I'm coming from.
Anyway, have a great show, and long live the PS2.
I stopped playing Kingdom Hearts 2 as soon as they announced the final cut because I'm going to start over on that one
ShadowHeartsRPG Series ShadowHeartsRPG Series
I apologize for taking so long.
I definitely recommend that you give this series a try.
The first Shadow Hearts game, however, is hard to find, so you might have to find it on eBay.
I'm interested in your opinions about the series.
Have a great night.
Shadow Next Gen.
And we have various links to them, so I'm going to check them out a little bit later.
Shadow Hearts, the series?
Yeah.
I know the last one that came out, New World, looked pretty good.
I just didn't play it because I don't have time to play every obscure RPG out there.
But, um,
Yeah, it looked pretty cool.
It's kind of a unique concept, kind of set in the 1940s, I believe.
And you play like a detective son who ends up finding these portals to another dimension almost, and this stuff starts coming through and basically has to fight it with a bunch of your usual typical RPG plot, a bunch of people that have no reason to be together, kind of come together and then
Fight Monsters and stuff.
It looks like a lot of folks in the chatroom agree with my gamer ADD perspective.
Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, you're not the only one who does that.
Paradox Vincent says, OMG, thank you, Sky.
Thank you, thank you.
I'm not alone.
That's why I play music games.
And I think, to go back to what I had said in Part A about somebody had said all I ever seem to play are Xbox Live Arcade games, I think that might go help to explain it right there is that Xbox Live Arcade games, again, they're quick and not a lot of time and really satisfy my gamer ADD.
Yet why I keep going back to World of Warcraft, I'll never understand.
I think it's the social aspect of that.
My whole thing is, that's sort of why I was stuck on Cooking Mama for that long.
But you know, I was thinking about it, and I own a lot of games that I haven't given the attention that I'd like to give So like, I'm going back, I've started over on Popola Cross, just because you know how I was up in arms about how much I wanted to play that game You know, for years, and so I actually started over on Popola Cross so I can get to where I got before and actually play through it this time
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
We're not getting paid to play games eight hours a day.
If somebody wanted to do that, great.
I mean, because essentially that's what you do when you visit those big websites like, you know, I'm not going to name them, but the ones that are sponsored by magazine companies and things.
I mean, keep in mind, like, just my next week, I'm going to school four nights next week, doing a CPR class, working on a website, working on art commissions, and working full time.
So, I mean, that's a standard week.
You know, I...
We don't get to have free time all the time to do all the stuff that we would like to do, to play all the games.
But when I do have free time, it's all about the games.
What I was trying to say is that that's why when we do the show, we actually come and tell each other so that we can each give each other the impression of what we're looking at.
What's quick and easy to play, what's going to be a little time consuming, what project's going on, that type of thing.
and no more email, by the way.
Makes sense.
Except I got some spam, which I deleted.
I can say this.
I got an email and I neglected to mention this during housekeeping, but I'll mention it next week so it's at the top of the show because I know not everyone listens to the whole thing.
But I do want to confirm that Orange Lingerie is going to be back at Faname Con this year, which is being held from May 25th to May 28th at the San Jose Convention Center in California.
Right?
I'll be there for the weekend.
I just found this out too.
Dan's younger brother, his stepbrother, is getting married the weekend before that.
So I will definitely be there Saturday and Sunday.
Or Friday afternoon if I can at all.
FanimeCon is the sideshow.
I definitely need to remake my Tamari costume because the last one that was made was too big.
I'm actually thinking about starting to watch Bleach.
I watch Bleach and I pour it in the washer alright anyways so not having anything to do with Bleach or anime or anything like that apparently well unless you lived under a rock or something you probably didn't realize well Vista just came out all 50 billion OMG it did?
yeah really I'm just rushing right out to go buy it
Like I did with XP.
But if you happen to be gaming on a PC that has the parental control set on it, it might actually break some of your casual games like games that use Wild Tangent.
And according to your gamer, DirectX creator Alex St.
John says basically that they tried making sure that it wouldn't break
all the different games out there they thought they covered everything but unfortunately Wild Tangent is denoted as spyware by the anti-spyware applications in Vista and says normally the software is generally harmless but it does get installed without isn't Wild Tangent the games that come with AOL Instant Messenger because those games are spyware I'm sorry yeah I think so Wild Tangent is spyware so
Whatever, I mean, it's not a huge deal, but just thought you might want to know.
Because there are some people that like casual games like Christopher and... Blackboy says, wow, Loki's news is old, they patched this already.
Yes, it is old.
And, you know, it's just like, I don't care.
But nevertheless, you know, isn't it funny that they rolled out an operating system and it broke half the games on it?
I mean, why should I upgrade to Windows Vista?
Anybody?
Anybody.
Would anybody like to tell me why I need to drop the money right now to upgrade to Windows Vista?
I'm not going to.
Because you have to upgrade your computer, too.
Because I don't, what?
You've got to upgrade your computer, too.
I don't understand why I need to upgrade right now.
I'm not.
This is all the more reason for me to just buy my iMac.
Screw Windows.
I mean, between the PC I have now and the Mac, I'm doing just fine.
I don't need Windows Vista.
What?
You look like you want to say something smart-ass so bad.
It's hurting you.
Whatever.
That's fine.
That's fine.
You guys are fine with your Macs.
That's great, you know.
I'm sure games will come to it eventually.
I don't play PC games, and the only PC game I play is World of Warcraft.
And I have Guild Wars on my laptop, so I don't have to worry about it.
JeremyTodd1 says, There's no reason to upgrade right now.
Simple as that.
Just upgrade in a couple of years and there's actually a reason to upgrade.
DDRDollarBill says, Vista has had a lot of returns.
Ouch.
So we'll see.
Maybe later.
Ha.
Vista doesn't run anything.
Um...

We look forward to extending that commitment with this expansion as well as with future Blizzard releases.
So it sounds like if we get it here, you're going to get it in China from the 9, even if it is a little bit later on.
You have to just wait for all the localization and stuff.
Well, we have to do that for Japanese games, so it's only fair that that side of the world has to wait for us once in a while.
Oh, and then they get the joy of patching.
Oh, how beautiful.
Then you get to patch World of Warcraft seven times before you can play it.
It's so much fun.
And then it won't patch, and then you have to download it and do it yourself.
Oh.
Anyway.
Actually, can I suggest this real quick?
X-Fire has a patching system built in that's actually pretty good.
I have to say, you wouldn't think I would usually endorse a program like X-Fire, but it actually is really cool.
I really like X-Fire.
I think that's a great little application, anyway, for a PC gamer.
Anyway, sorry.
Well, take your word for it, Rob.
Yeah, please do.
Okay.
Speaking of MMOs, there is an MMO coming to the UK.
It's called Two Worlds.
It's being released on a PC and Xbox 360.
The good thing about it, it's a free-roaming RPG that's the orc versus human deal.
But the cool thing is that it's...
I'm getting tongue-tied today.
It has unique quests, a one-on-one arena battle, horse races, and customizable characters with no level capping.
So that's pretty cool.
I can truly be a god character in that game.
I hear it's very similar to... Oblivion.
Yeah.
Very similar to Oblivion.
JeremyTel1 wants to point out and clarify from what he's read about the game.
The 360 version only has 8-player multiplayer.
Only the PC version is an MMO.
8 players is still not bad.
That's still fun.
That's still an OL army.
And 8 players.
That'll be fun.
Now, here's what I want to know, because I haven't really read up on much.
I wonder if Crackdown is more than two players co-op, because that'd be awesome if you have like four people.
Hmm.
I don't know.
I guess we'll see more when the game comes out, because if it's coming on 360, we'll probably get a demo.
So who knows?
Yeah.
Anyways, so...
3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures
Um, so that's gonna become an Alien Hominid HD, which is kind of an HD upgrade to the original Alien Hominid game.
Uh, Band of Bugs, which is supposed to be by Ninja Bee.
It's kind of a, I guess, a strategy game.
Uh, it's kind of neat.
Castlevania Symphony of Night.
No big surprise there.
Uh, Catan.
Uh, Settlers Catan.
Remember, that was one that was rumored to be coming at some point.
Eats.
Chowdown.
Um, kind of a
Different game, I guess it's a port of a PC title by the same name.
Luxor 2, which should make Nelly happy, another kind of Zuma clone type of thing.
Paperboy, Rootbeard Tapper.
Paperboy and Rootbeard Tapper are awesome.
I know you guys bitch about the classic coin-op ports, but these are some true classics that are underrated, I think.
And then my favorite of the list here, Worms HD is going to be coming out, and that's awesome.
We used to have epic Worms...
Worms is awesome.
You know what's interesting, though?
We neglected to say this in our coverage of Konami Gamers Day, but did you notice they had nothing on Xbox Live Arcade?
I was very surprised we didn't see Castlevania Symphony of the Night on our Live Arcade, because they had it at CES.
I would have thought that's what they would have used their 360s for instead of showing Wii 11.
That's kind of what I thought we were going to see, too, but I guess not.
That's all right.
XBOXLIVE
That's without Halo 3 beta stuff.
I don't know if people are maybe downloading this to see if it's worth it, if they want to do the Halo 3.
I've played the demo.
I couldn't get into it.
I'll have to do co-op with somebody who can kind of show me what the hell I'm supposed to be doing because I didn't get it.
I'm stupid sometimes.
You can punch people and throw them in the cars and then throw cars on top of them.
I'll try it again.
What's great, though, is they have achievements for throwing dead bodies into the air and then bouncing rockets off of them.
I'll just have to come over and watch you play at some point and see if it's worth it for me.
I swear I'm going to sign up for a game rental site or something this week so I stop buying all this stuff new.
We'll see.
Anyhow, I guess that's all I have to say about Crackdown.
Well, there is different games to be downloaded, especially Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live Arcade.
They were talking about the memory card coming out that was supposed to be 256 megabytes, but the pre-order on GameStop's website is 512 megabytes for the portable memory.
So in other words, they gave it a secret upgrade.
Now it's 512.
or is it a typo on GameStop's end?
What do you think, Loki?
I haven't heard of anything official about them upgrading that, although I'm assuming that we'll find something new or find out something about it pretty soon, if not at all.
It seems kind of logical that would happen, though, right?
Yeah.
I mean, it makes sense, because 256, to me, the price point for it was a bit more expensive, and I mean, really...
I don't know why you'd buy a memory unit anyways.
I mean, spend the extra money and just get a hard drive.
That's what I say.
Just get the damn hard drive, unless you really have a need to take that shit with you on the go.
There's really no point.
Exactly.
So, yeah, no idea if this is official yet.
I imagine, I don't think it's going to be a typo, because I think originally they had 256 on there, so they probably just got it updated.
Interesting.
I don't know.
I'll keep my eyes out.
Please do.
Eyes and ears.
So we'll have to check them out.
Anywho, beyond the bigger memory cards, there is going to be another epic game coming to the Xbox 360, as well as a PlayStation 3 Unreal Tournament.
One unique thing about this, and I think we mentioned this back on an earlier show, they're going to be allowing mods to be used on the PlayStation 3 and the 360 version, probably as well as the PC.
Of course, they're also going to be including user-created mods as well.
So that's actually kind of cool that they're allowing mods on there, because I know there's been some pretty good mods available for, you know, just Unreal and Half-Life 2 and stuff.
It'd be really cool to see some of the stuff downloadable online.
Although, no idea when this game's coming out.
I like the idea of user mods coming out online.
I mean, the only time I can think of user-created content outside of an MMO that I've seen on Xbox, it would be DDR steps on DDR Ultramix 2 through 4 or whatever had the steps you could download online.
So you don't see a whole lot of user-created content, so that's kind of cool, I think.
Yeah.
Also, what's kind of cool, a Flash-based computer game called N. Which I used to play religiously.
It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
Describe N. I've never played N. What is N all about, Loki?
N kind of has this stick figure, like ninja type of character that you run around and you're collecting... Oh, God, I've watched you play this game before.
I know what... Okay, sorry, keep going.
So anyways, it's pretty awesome though.
You just run around and you collect stuff and there's like, as the levels get, you know, go on it gets harder and harder and there's like missiles and stuff you have to dodge and you just have to make it through like the time limit and stuff.
I've totally seen you play this game before.
Okay, now I know what it is.
Well, N Plus is coming out on Live Arcade later this year.
Will you be buying that?
Yes.
Alright, very cool.
Of course, who knows how long it's going to get delayed because by this time we were supposed to see Castle Crashers but, you know, not that we're bitter or anything like the rest of you.
The website of the week is thecastlevaniadungeons.com
You can get there by going to castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com I will be, of course, posting a link in the chatroom, which I have actually already done once today.
Because I was posting links to images of the original Rondo of Blood.
But if you go into the site, it has write-ups on every one of the games.
In fact, the first thing that you see is actually a big screen print of...
The updated Rondo of Blood There's artwork, multimedia, emulation, fanfiction It's really cool I've actually been going on this site in upwards of 8 years now It really is the, I'd have to say, most in-depth Castlevania site ever And really, I can't say good enough about it It really is up there In fact, this site actually, if Dan told me right
inspired his site that he used to have back in the day, which was Neo Strider's Strider Zone, if you wouldn't ever remember that.
Nerds.
I did his graphics for him, so it's partly my site too.
But Casting the Dungeon is just fantastic.
Kudos to the folks that run it.
You guys have been just keeping it awesome for years and so cool.
So go there.
Now, I mean, after the show.
Why am I not surprised the Castlevania site made it for her website of the week?
Well, it was going to be History.com.
Now you just gave away what next week was likely to be.
No, next week isn't History.com.
I am completely shocked.
Completely shocked.
That's what I thought.
Anyways, there are some other weird news that managed to leak out this week.
This website, DVD Empire, they were making big news about exiting the video game business.
and apparently gave their top 8 reasons why they are leaving the game business.
Now, most people are like, who the fuck's DVD Empire?
Well, the only way I've heard of them before is because, well, a couple reasons.
One, they're the legit side of adult DVD Empire, which, you know, is big on adult movies.
The other thing is, we actually sell to them.
Or we did at one time, I guess, because now they're out of the business.
But I just thought it was interesting, some of the reasons that they mentioned that they're leaving the game's business, because it actually doesn't make any sense.
And I don't think a lot of sites are covering this.
Well, let me just real quickly go down the list.
1.
Video game industry does not care.
The video game industry only cares about the mass emergence like Toys R Us, Walmart, Best Buy, etc.
They completely ignore the needs and wants of medium or small game retailers and blow with how they do it.
Well, that's sort of true.
I mean, you're not going to be able to bring in a retail kiosk or anything like that if you're a small guy.
You have to be doing a lot of business with them.
They can't make money, they say.
Which is funny because I have a lot of customers that do make money.
Lots of it.
You may not care whether or not we make money, but we continue to pay to sell video games.
It is impossible for us to make money selling video games.
Video game manufacturers set the price using what they call MSRP.
Here's an example of the video gaming industry greed.
They set the retail price at $5 above product costs.
Buy it for $54.99, sell it for $59.99.
That is completely untrue.
Their price, which I happened to, after reading this, I looked it up, is way below that price.
In fact, I think they were, at least for us, buying 6%, or their discount was our cost plus 6%.
So they were actually paying 6% over what we paid for it.
So they were still making tons of money on this stuff, and there's never that type of margins on stuff at all.
So I don't know what the fuck they're talking about there, and they can definitely make money off of that stuff.
They're also saying no price protections, games dropping price quickly.
These guys used to buy one piece of different things at a time.
So they wouldn't have a large inventory.
That wouldn't even apply.
No returns, that's all over the industry.
They say distribution is dumb.
I don't know who their rep was, so that might be the case.
They say basically that they get their product three days after street date.
Well, unless they are a big chain company...
They won't get any product on street date because you have to be direct with the actual publishers in order to get stuff on street date.
So that's, they're just stupid.
And better suited for brick and mortar retailers, that might be true, but either way, they're just bitching and moaning.
So, good riddance.
Travis Donovan from our own Saturday Night program here at Orange Lounge Radio says, I tried ordering from them back in 02 and it took three weeks to get my order and then it was wrong and then another month and a half to get what I ordered.
All their games are now 20% off.
I'm sure you were buying games and not porno, right, Travis?
Yeah, and, well, the other thing, too, they were talking about here, there's some updates at the bottom of their little bitch page here.
They have three different updates.
One of them says, we knew about the low profit margins when developing our game sufficient.
Then why are you bitching?
Why did they put up a bitch page in the first place?
That's kind of unprofessional.
It's so retarded.
And then the other one, people responded to our news with, well, your model sucked.
You should have sold used games and accessories.
Let me put it this way.
There are retailers and smaller guys that sell a lot more than you guys do.
I don't know if we were their only distributor, but if we were, they weren't buying anything.
They weren't hardly buying anything.
They are just really whining.
Get out of the business.
Well, one thing I'm sure will be successful, no matter how it's delivered to folks, would be a Katamari Damacy online game.
Catamari Damacy Online
DarkSakura.com
All right.
Well, we would like to take this opportunity to welcome your phone calls at this time by opening up our Skype line.
Our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
That number is toll-free in the United States and Canada.
If you'd rather, though, or if you're in another country, you should call us on Skype.
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
You can get more detail by going to our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com, and clicking on Interact With Us.
So while we wait for some phone calls, do you have any last-minute news, some real quick last-minute news, anyone?
Yes, real quick.
A couple things.
There's some stuff being developed for the PSP homebrew stuff.
One of these is the Legend of Zelda Quest for Link.
And actually it looks kind of cool, kind of resembles the Super Nintendo Zelda.
So if you want to check that, PSP Updates has the link for you.
And then there's also one that looks like a cross between Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Biohazard.
Biohazard 2 version 2.0 final has been released.
and yeah, it looks exactly like Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
It was 1230 when I was over here.
should be said.
Again, I love all games, but their phone system, I don't know if it happens to you when you call in, but you hear yourself echoing, and it totally bugs.
Oh, I agree.
I couldn't hear anything they were saying, so it was tough.
It hasn't always been that way, because I've been on the show before, and I didn't have that.
But anyway, is that all you wanted to say?
No, two more things.
Okay, what else?
Sam and Max is great on GameTap.
I've been enjoying myself with it.
I freaking updated GameTap this week, meaning to play it, and then I got sucked into something else.
I played one of those stupid arcade games.
Well, that too, but you know, because GameTap has like 800 games on it.
So it's like you go there, I'm like, oh, I'm going to finally play Myst Online or Sam and Max, and then I'm like, holy shit, they put this game on there?
I've totally got to play that game.
So I think it was like Rainbow Islands or some crap.
I know, ADD.
I know.
You're ADD.
Yeah, there it is.
You have gamer ADD as well?
I do.
I couldn't finish Hitman, and that made me mad.
I wanted to finish it, and it gave me mad.
What else is on your mind?
Okay, I have to tell you about the Mario Kart 64 thing.
I have to tell you why.
Why the save ghost thing?
It's because the Wii, the emulator for the N64 doesn't realize that it's not an N64 before.
It's running on a Wii, so it's thinking it's on an N64.
That's what an emulator is.
But it's thinking that it's an N64 and it's thinking that it has an N64 pack in it.
It thinks it needs that.
It needs that, but in retrospect, it doesn't have it.
I kind of sort of was implying that when I said that in order to make it work, they would have to go and recode the game itself.
And that's a lot more than just trying to emulate it correctly.
But you're right, they would have to recode the game to instead of looking for the memory pack, look for the Wii's memory.
And that's not something that's easily done with a 15-year-old... No, how old is that game?
10 years old?
With a 10-year-old game.
I know that other emulated sites like Project, I'm not going to say the rest, but they got through that.
The Wii, it's built up emulation.
It's only going to pull what it thinks.
The save states on the cartridge will work fine on the Wii.
It's just those cartridge games might not.
Well, we shall see.
You know, I do want to say this, though.
I do agree that Nintendo definitely should use that patching feature to fix some of these things.
I mean, not so much the ghost thing.
I could care less about that.
But I would just love to see them give little bonuses, especially the multiplayer.
Especially with the old-ass 8-bit games like Mario Brothers.
How much more valuable would games like that be if we could play those online?
Seriously.
Just one more second.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah, and I thought the emulation was good on the N64.
Like, wouldn't you be pissed if you played Mario and it was off, like, one millisecond?
Yeah.
All right, that's all I have to say.
All right, I do want to say one other thing, though, about the emulation, is that one thing, you know, having the widescreen HD and everything, I noticed that the Xbox 360 is smart enough to put the vertical letterbox on my games when I'm playing something that's not widescreen, but the Nintendo Wii is not.
and I really wish it was and that is not a very hard fix.
And yes, I realize I could dig up the TV remote and switch it that way but it's so much easier when the system just does it automatically.
I would love to see Nintendo make that little patch.
You're right and that's it.
I want you to get another call.
No problem.
Thank you Raven Stolfen for your opinion as always.
He had his agenda tonight and he has one, two, three agenda.
Bravo.
Good job.
All right, we welcome your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or the Skype line.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up?
It's the Rob D. Hi, the Rob D. How are you doing?
Not too bad.
Well, actually, I'm a little bit sad, but it has nothing to do with anything other than the Super Bowl.
I'm from Chicago.
We're not too big on the Super Bowl here, but I understand it was a big thing for folks around Chicago.
I know one of our lesbians is from the immediate area.
I was rooting for the Bears simply because I was hoping they'd make another music video.
Super Bowl shuffle?
Yes, exactly.
My favorite line from that is probably, now I'm as smooth as a chocolate swirl.
But you have to admit, and without getting too much further into sports, you have to admit that opening touchdown was hilarious.
Yeah, definitely.
Comedy Gold.
Alright, what's on your mind tonight, game-wise?
Well, basically, I have to talk about the whole ghost-saving thing with a memory pack.
Popular topic tonight, yes.
What's on your mind?
Well, I disagree that it has to do with hacking the game itself or altering the game itself in any way.
I think that the emulator could be programmed to emulate a control pack itself.
I suppose, I don't know, I guess maybe I'm just thinking, the reason why my brain goes there is I'm thinking maybe it's just simply the way the data is written, or you're talking about different types of memory, I don't know, my brain, for some reason I'm thinking in my mind, it has to be the game that's recoded.
I don't know, I wish Nintendo would be more open, but you know, they're not going to tell us the specifics.
Well, I just figured since every PC emulator has figured out a way to get around save data, it would only take a little bit of ingenuity to get around it on the Wii.
I suppose.
I suppose.
But unfortunately, the Wii is so locked down when it comes to hacking and all that stuff.
It's got to be Nintendo who does it.
I honestly don't think they care enough.
I think they just want to start cranking out more virtual console games for us to buy.
I think they want to get working on Pokemon Snap and whatever else on the 64 they're going to be bringing us.
Ocarina of Time, all that crap.
Yeah, it's not a big deal for ghost data.
I never used it in the N64 version anyway.
Yeah, I didn't have a memory pack, so it's kind of a moot point to me.
I'm like, oh, well, that's too bad I can't save ghost data, but then again, I'm barely playing this as it is because I have such bad gamer ADD.
The other thing I'd like to comment on, though, is since Final Fantasy VI comes out this week for the Game Boy Advance, I think that's a great thing.
I love Final Fantasy VI.
It's my favorite Final Fantasy game ever.
Terra's theme is...
Quite possibly my favorite piece of music from any game.
The opera is one of the best scenes in video games.
It could be the best.
Oh, I know.
I know it's a different thing.
I'm talking about a different part of the game.
But the opera scene is possibly the best scene in video game history, period.
Very fun.
And when I went to the More Friends concert a couple years ago before E3 and they reenacted that thing, like they had the actual opera singers, just chills.
Even though the rest of the concert had sound glitches galore, that part was phenomenal.
Phenomenal.
Why haven't we seen a remake of Chrono Trigger?
Didn't they touch it on the PlayStation 1 at least?
They did, Final Fantasy Chronicle.
You know, it's kind of like, why doesn't Nintendo do a new Kid Icarus?
It's kind of like, it squares little franchises that they're just kind of waiting for the right time on, I suppose, to really wow us.
But yeah, that is kind of interesting.
Why haven't we seen a Chrono Trigger type game on the DS?
I wonder if the other part of it isn't Toriyama's stake in it.
Maybe.
Toriyama is a really big name in art in Japan, so it could possibly be his own stake in it.
Yeah, but what other RPG could get me to care about an anthropomorphic frog?
True.
Maybe they'll add one in Final Fantasy VI.
Battletoads, hey.
What happened to Battletoads vs. Double Dragon?
Battletoads was too fucking hard.
Everyone gave up on it.
Yeah, it took me forever to get through, but I did actually beat that game, but that's a different story altogether.
That's all I had to say, so
So I'll leave you to the rest of the show.
No problem.
Thanks so much for your insight, Rob D. We've been enjoying your chat comments tonight.
Thank you.
All right, take care, buddy.
You too.
Later.
All right, let's go to another call right here on the line.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is Brad from PodCulture.
Hey, Brad from PodCulture.
How you doing, buddy?
I'm short and I'm fat and I'm going bald, but other than that, okay.
Well, real life sucks, but that's okay.
That's why we have the Internet.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Rob's not as bad as me.
I've got like ten people waiting at the queue.
That's no big thing.
I'm more interested in playing with the me's more than anything else.
I'll just send you my doctor.
I will send you the goat say me somebody made me.
It's disgusting.
It's brilliant.
Oh, Lord.
I have Michael Jackson and the doctor.
I think it was SSJ100 Matt made it.
It's a goat say me.
It's hilarious.
It's so wrong on so many levels.
But funny.
Anyway, what else is on your mind regarding the we?
Well, I got the Mario Kart 64, downloaded that today.
And not only that, the problem with the ghost data, I was having problems with plugging in my GameCube controller and using it.
Oh, because those games are optimized for the Wii Classic controller.
I haven't tried the GameCube controller.
What were the problems you were having?
It's like the A button wouldn't work.
And I know it's not the controller.
I played that...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You don't like the Wii Classic controller?
No.
What is it about it you don't like?
I guess I'm being used to the Xbox controller or PlayStation.
It's just the way that it fits in the hands.
I see.
The thing that weirds me out about the controller is all the buttons on the top of it.
There's an L button, an R button, and then a little Z, and these other little nubs on it.
And there's too many buttons.
Is it me, or is the A and B buttons reversed?
from what they normally would be on the controller.
No, I think they're right, but sometimes if you play a lot of Japanese games, they're usually backwards, and so that can kind of mess with you.
It just seems like it's in a weird place.
Yeah.
And then what else was that?
Oh, Nintendo Maniac64 says a classic controller is needed for Super Nintendo games.
I'd agree with that, because the GameCube had that funky layout for the buttons.
I beg to differ.
You use the GameCube controller on Super Nintendo games?
The HoriPad.
Hori made a GameCube controller that was in the Super Nintendo.
Oh, so you're not really using a GameCube controller.
I get it.
But if you don't have a classic controller, you've still got another way to do it.
Okay, I didn't even think about a third-party GameCube controller.
And the fact that the Hori pads came out in the U.S.
at major retailers.
Oh, there you go.
Good insight, DarkSakura.
All right.
So what other games have you been playing on your Wii, Brad?
All right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know what?
I'll go get you a Wii card if you promise me the first thing you download is R-Type.
Oh, sure.
You send me a Wii card, I'll download anything you want.
Just wait until after I make my next school payment.
Wow.
Look at this, guys.
Call in tonight.
Jamie's giving away free Wii points.
Only to my fellow Whovian.
All right.
It's like a contest.
Say something nice about Doctor Who win Wii points.
Send those emails to mailbag at orangefleshradio.com.
I will send Wii points to whoever gets me a David Tennant signature.
Oh, there you go.
Which, actually, I could just do that with an envelope, but still.
There you go.
Zappy in our chat says, I love Doctor Who.
Give me.
All right.
Brad, anything else on your mind tonight?
Yeah, the DOA movie actually doesn't suck.
Really?
See, all I've heard is really negative things about it.
Now, I know you reviewed it on your own program, but in a nutshell, what were your thoughts on it?
It's complete popcorn.
It's not, there's not a whole lot of, I mean, it's all substance, but are all... All style, no substance?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, it's a fun summer movie kind of thing.
I mean, it's just fun.
It's not... So, it's like, it's one of those movies where, like, turn your brain off for two hours and just kind of be a mindless zombie and it's not so bad?
Oh, yeah.
All right, that's cool.
Why do you think it bypassed theaters?
I really don't know because I've paid ten bucks to see movies that are ten times worse than that.
That's true.
I did pay to see Lady in the Water.
Did you have the life, or is it, I'm sorry, is it true in Dead or Alive movie that they have like life bars and the announcer in it?
Yeah.
Was that, that sounds cheesy.
Was it cheesy?
It's very cheesy in some places, yeah.
Oh well, I suppose you don't go see a Dead or Alive movie expecting Oscar caliber, Judi Dench acting in it type content.
Although it would be kind of funny if Judi Dench was in Dead or Alive, don't you think?
Forget it.
No.
Not funny.
Alright.
Well, yeah, I hope they go to your program and check out the full review of Dead or Alive.
Alright.
Alright, well Brad, thanks so much for calling in tonight.
We gotta go to another call, but take care buddy, okay?
Later on, man.
Later.
Peace.
Alright, little mini movie review here on Orange Launch Radio.
Let's go to one more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, Shadow Next Gen in chat.
Hi, Shadow Next Gen in chat.
What's on your mind, buddy?
I apologize if you guys talked about this earlier as I was late to the show because of the Super Bowl.
Alright, a lot of people have that excuse tonight, but try me.
What's up?
Do you guys have any idea about what Konami's quote-unquote earth-shattering news tomorrow is going to be?
You know what?
We didn't bring this up, but I had read somewhere that they have earth-shattering news coming on Monday.
It's on their own website.
They're advertising tomorrow.
Earth-shattering news.
and I saw that get picked up on Kotaku or Destructoid or one of those sites.
No, because they didn't tell us what it is on Thursday.
I can guarantee you, we talked earlier in the show about we weren't allowed to say some things for some time, but I can guarantee you everything that we were allowed to say has been said now.
Here's the earth-shattering news.
Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming soon.
I have a feeling.
It's probably about one of the games we didn't see.
Like, where was the Metal Gear Solid 4 info?
You know, maybe that's it.
Maybe it's the Metal Gear Solid release date because don't you remember her saying something like, well, we want to give you the release date, but can we do that yet?
No?
Like, didn't she kind of do that kind of thing?
Like, wasn't that how she was teasing the release date?
She's just...
or was she just smoking a bowl?
Doesn't she remind you just a little bit of what's-her-name from Nintendo, the Perrin Kaplan or whatever?
I don't know.
But anyway, I would say if it's that earth-shattering, it's the Metal Gear Solid 4 release date, new trailer, something like that.
Something that missed Konami Gamers Day for whatever reason.
Well, I know I was reading a lot of people are thinking it's maybe Konami's confirmation of MGS4 and the 360s.
I have a feeling if that's going to happen, it's going to be a window where it's going to be on the PS3 for six months, and then it'll come out on the 360.
It might be like Virtua Fighter and just be Blade.
Yeah, that's essentially what I'm getting at, is that it might be one of those things.
Because I'll tell you what, Sony needs that so bad right now.
And you can kind of tell that Konami's really back in the PSP more than almost anyone else.
Konami is doing what they can for Sony.
So, you know, they still are in the business of making money, but I have a feeling they're going to give at least a window.
I would not expect that to be tomorrow's news.
But I could be wrong.
That could be it.
I see what you did there.
Funny.
What do you hope it is, Shadow Next Gen?
Personally, like I said, I'd like to see Metal Gear on the 360.
That would probably be for me.
That way, one less reason for me to shell out $600.
Well, I know, yeah, it would be bad news for Sony if that is what they announce tomorrow.
Do you think Sony ought to just throw in the towel at that point?
Or what can Sony do if they're about to lose Metal Gear Solid to the 360?
I really couldn't tell you.
Well, for one thing, they can start listening to their community like Microsoft does.
Oh, good idea.
It seems like they keep telling us what we want instead of listening to what we want.
That is true.
They don't have anything quite like Major Nelson.
You've got to give that to Microsoft.
Microsoft is by no means perfect, but at least they do have their outlet with their community.
And you've got to admit, though, Nintendo kind of doesn't really listen to people either, but somehow they get away with it.
No, they don't, but I think they do a little bit better.
But yeah, they could do better in that area as well.
We seem to forgive Nintendo because they kind of at least deliver a little more than Sony seems to have been recently, I think is what it comes down to.
Well, I think, personally, I think the reason why Sony has gotten so much far over the past year is just their PR.
If they wouldn't have said half of their stupid comments, they'd probably be in a much better position right now.
I would agree with you there.
Like the time when people will buy a PS3 even if there are no games for it.
I guess that's true.
Alright, well, we will see what that announcement is and we'll talk about it next week.
So, Shadow Next Gen, I'm hoping you'll call us back next week and let us know about the news, whatever it is.
Yeah, alright.
Sounds good, guys.
Alright, take care, buddy.
Have a good one.
Yeah, you too.
Later.
That's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
Thank you so much to all our people calling in.
And I apologize if we didn't get to your call.
We were getting hammered a lot there towards the end.
But we just got to keep things moving.
We're running a little late tonight.
So we are going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show.
Are there any more last-minute stories, guys?
Yeah.
All right.
Yes, Loki.
A few things.
There's going to be a brand-new wipeout.
I know.
This is a surprise.
Brand-new wipeout coming to the PS3 and PSP.
and actually looks pretty good they have some screenshots up on that you know looks very similar to the other Wipeout games apparently Microsoft is bringing Project Silphid over here for Square Enix and they're going to be publishing it stateside so that's kind of cool I'm very much looking forward to that one so we'll see the next gen shooter on 360 soon rumors are that according to Famitsu Resident Evil 5 is delayed to 2008 I definitely believe that um
Let's see, another rumor here, and this apparently was actually coming from, I want to say Bungie.
Yeah, actually it was from their last Bungie update.
They were saying that you'll be able to modify the gravity in, I believe, multiplayer games.
So you can reduce the gravity to 50% and jump even further.
Hooray for low gravity games, you all know that's coming.
Can I give some quick chatroom comments to the last phone call here?
NM64 says, Sky, I think Nintendo surprised their fans.
Sony tells fans what they want.
TheRobD says, That's because Nintendo doesn't act like arrogant jerks and piss all over our memories when they don't listen to us.
Blackboy says, Nintendo totally doesn't listen to the consumers.
Let's see.
Hitstun says, Konami announces Boktai game for PS3.
Yeah!
You have to drag your PS3 out into the sun.
Bandit says, Breaking news, Konami's tears can cure cancer, if only it was able to cry.
How random.
How ripped off from the Chuck Norris.
Yeah, I get it, I get it.
Anyways, there was also another rumored list of titles coming out for the Wii.
This is supposedly from the new GamePro issue, the March issue.
On the list, we have 100 Bullets, which is supposed to hit in the fall.
Alive, which is being done by Ubisoft.
Remember, that's that one girl game thing that's supposed to make you cry and stuff.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
I remember that.
The Devil, a new Devil Kings game, which is very similar, it's Capcom's, uh, kind of Dying Sea Warriors type of game, a new Digimon game, uh, DK Bongo Blast, I guess is now coming out for the Wii, uh, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, not a big surprise, uh, Iron Man, the movie game coming out in 2008, Kirby, uh, new Kirby game 2007, I guess fall, Legend of the Dragon, I know Legend of the Dragon is coming out, um, Lost, they're supposed to be doing a game this year on that, um,
Ratatouille I know that's coming out and that's actually not fall like listed on here Mario Kart for the Wii Pilot Wings for the Wii I don't believe that but I guess we'll see a new Wii shooting game and some new Wii Sports Wii Motorsports and they're going to have that airplane game that was shown to E3 Wii Music which is supposed to come in October TNA Impact
Jawa, which I have no idea what that is, Space Station Tycoon, Dance Factory, Animal Crossing, Right Over the River, which actually looks pretty awesome.
That's also coming out in the DS, and Sadness.
We'll see.
Jamie's still on the Castlevania kick and now she's trying to get me into it too.
Sorry, I found a YouTube thing where someone has uploaded apparently the entire run of the game.
And real quick, because I know this makes for awesome radio, I wanted to show you, Rob, a game I liked.
I know you like Burnout.
Well, this is another game, Flatout.
They have the first screenshots for Flatout Ultimate Carnage on Xbox side.
So I thought you might want to check this out because it looks very similar to Burnout.
And it looks very good.
Wow, that's very pretty.
It's like Burnout, but you can launch your driver through the windshield.
That is great.
I'm going to so play that.
Hooray.
Yeah.
All right, any other last minute news, Loki, DarkSakura, anyone?
Rondo of Blood is the best.
Really?
Yes.
I never knew.
All right.
I guess that means we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
I do want to say this.
I usually don't tease what's coming up next week on the program.
But next week, we have a juicy exclusive for you guys.
One of our listeners, and I trust this person, has laid eyes on the script for the Alice movie.
And we are going to have...
We are going to be divulging a lot of details on the Alice movie that you're not supposed to know about right here on the program next week.
So stay tuned for that.
That's your teaser for next week.
In the meantime, that means that's it.
End of show.
Thank you guys so much for tuning in, supporting Independent Radio, supporting Orange Launch Radio.
You guys are awesome.
We love you to bits.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
Loki, your final thought tonight.
My final thought is I'm completely done with Microsoft's retail training.
At least I'm caught up.
and by the way chat room yes that is American McGee's Alice that we're talking about DarkSakura your final thought Richter Belmont I'm sorry Richter I'm actually got a really freaking busy week ahead of me so just I need energy alright my final thought is I want ice cream so bad right now it hurts I have ice cream I want like Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone I'm never eating it in and out again by the way
Why?
Did you read the nutritional content?
Yes.
Yeah, that's a good way to stop eating fast food like ever again.
I love their fries, the 400 calories for those tasty, beautiful potatoes.
I can just make them at home in the oven, and then they're like 200.
All right.
You can cut up a potato and put it in the oven.
Yeah, I could do that.
That's not bad.
All right, that's it, folks.
We'll be back next week with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
Until then, hugs and kisses from us to you.
Take care.
Have a good week.
www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next week!
