00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for part B of our podcast.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
This is the first time you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Remember that we do broadcast in two parts because we tape live on Sunday nights

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
for about three hours or as tonight's going maybe about four hours.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
There's some bonus stuff that you can only hear when you listen to us live or when you listen to us on our rebroadcast over at www.allgames.com

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
which is Mondays at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time and Tuesdays at 9 a.m.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
We like all games because it's this big melting pot of independent podcasts on the internet so it's cool.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
We're happy to be a part of it and we're also happy to bring you some more gaming news so let's get back into it.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah and I don't see this happening anytime soon. I see In The Groove being made by Konami before this ever happens.

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
But apparently Microsoft's Rare, people are thinking just because Diddy Kong Racing came out and that was made by Rare

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
that more Rare games are going to make their way I guess to the DS.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
Well probably not the case but according to Microsoft's VP Shane Kim, he spoke to one up and basically told them

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
a cameo or Viva Pinata on DS makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways from a franchise perspective.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
I think it's fair to say we're going to continue to invest in Viva Pinata but you probably won't see it on the PSP.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
I would say you probably won't see it on the DS either because that's still a competing system with them I mean.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
That seems so weird to me. So you're basically saying people are assuming because of the fact he said that.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
And this just further lends that thing that Microsoft is secretly in bed with Nintendo but they are so the bottom

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
because Reggie just keeps regulating on Microsoft that no we don't want to form a partnership with Microsoft

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
we'd rather you buy more of our games and more of our components.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
So Microsoft is totally being a submissive bottom in this relationship because now they're talking about

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
oh but Nintendo I'll totally put Viva Pinata inside you.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
I don't know is it just me?

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
It would work but first off Viva Pinata the graphics wouldn't look right.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
I mean it's just another kind of not really a Pokemon type of game but it's you know your breeding stuff.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I don't know.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
SSJ100Matt says maybe Microsoft should give Nintendo advice on internet play. You win.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah. Seriously.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
Bandit says hey Rare and yes I'm talking with my mouth full I can do that it's partly my show too.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Bandit says hey Rare give me Killer Instinct already.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I say that with a mouth full of donut.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Fuck that you get Banjo-Kazooie.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Ewww.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Kazooie wasn't that bad.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yes it was.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
Mike W says Major Nelson hearts Nintendo.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
So does Trixie.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I remember reading on one of Trixie's blogs in the expo.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I have no idea why I was reading Trixie's blog.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I was bored on the internet and that's where I found myself.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Whenever I hear Trixie I think of the stripper in the Rocky Horror Picture Show but never mind.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
So I'm like do you perform with the cast?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Anyway Trixie she wrote like her Christmas list and one of the things on the Christmas list was a Wii.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Then I was like aren't you guys supposed to be competitors?

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
So Microsoft again being the submissive big old bottom.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
That's your thing.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Can I say personally though that I'm actually really impressed at how the Xbox 360 just took off.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I mean again I'm more of a spectator because of little money.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
But I mean at the very beginning having an Xbox was just no you know you have a console that freezes.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
And everybody's giving crap to all my friends who you know initially went out and bought an Xbox.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And the 360 seems to be kicking some serious ass.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
So I mean that seems to be exciting and it's actually something that I enjoyed as well when I started to play it.

04:23.000 --> 04:32.000
I think the problem with the classic Xbox can be personified with a comic strip I used to read that hasn't really been updated in a long time.

04:32.000 --> 04:43.000
But if you ever read Spamusement I think the problem with the Xbox was brilliantly summed up in a Spamusement cartoon where it said the subject line.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
For those who don't know Spamusement takes spam email subject lines and make cartoons out of them.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
So the spam email subject line was are you man enough for this?

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
And what it was is it was an Xbox with a deep fryer attachment.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
And that was the problem with the original Xbox is it was too butch.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
But the Xbox 360.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And the controller was just too fucking big.

05:07.000 --> 05:16.000
The Xbox 360 you know it's still butch you know it's not gay but it's a little fruity and that's okay.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
It's got like Viva Pinata.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I was this close actually to getting my boyfriend the Xbox 360.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm too good I got my ex a PSP for Christmas.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
I was this close to actually getting my boyfriend the 360 because that's what he loves because he loves the Xbox for Christmas.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
But well I figured that the Xbox was 300 something odd dollars worth of depreciation.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Whereas the guitar gets worth more.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
And also the Xbox 360 is worth a lot of ignoring girlfriend time.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
So but you know when the price drops up I'll probably invest in it because people are very happy with them.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Oh JV Mon sums it up perfectly the 360 is metrosexual.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
Not to I hate going back to the well no I don't but not to go too much back to the gay issue.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
But I get a magazine called The Advocate which is basically a gay and lesbian magazine specifically.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Is that Glad's agenda?

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Because you know I am a gay gamer I'm not the biggest fan of Glad.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Because they have to get their panties ruffled too easy.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
I don't know who it was but they were talking about how video games are starting to bring more of that in.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
And they were talking like Bully was one of them Sims 2 but they talked about Gears of War.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
Like the two main characters like no one can convince me that those two characters are not boning each other.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
Well look you know one of the achievements is called I wish I knew how to quit you or like Dom curious.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
I don't remember what it was called something like oh no that was like I can't quit you Dom or something like that.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
It's one of the achievements in Gears of War.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Oh my god.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
There's subtleties there.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Meg's giving me huge shit about it like they are not.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
It's nothing major it's just an LOL moment.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
It's not trying to make a statement or anything like oh Cliffy B is like secretly a gay supporter.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Maybe he is I don't who cares it's a video game who cares.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
I can't tear away my boyfriend from Gears of War at Best Buy does that make him kind of gay?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
You can tear away your microphone with gay.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Because I'll totally go for the guy that said he'd marry me for like an adventure game.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I got gay from Rob a long time ago with the Pepsi bong.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Alright anyhow.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Golf Land.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm being asked by several people please tell me you aren't a crab person.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
No well both of us because we are both gay.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Did you ever see an episode of South Park with the crab people?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Queer Eye?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Never mind.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Do we ever talk video games on the show?

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
Yes we do once in a while and this is a very interesting sort of game that's coming to the DS.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
There's a new brand of toys in Japan called Treasure Gaust and it's going to be coming to the DS.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Well get this.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
You remember how like Boktai used Sunlight and there was another game in Japan that used bar codes?

07:55.000 --> 08:03.000
This game uses natural magnetic fields to build your Pokemon-ish type creatures.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
So the game is encouraging you to find the Earth's natural magnetic fields to build your monster.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Dude that's interesting but I did not like Boktai.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Lunar Nights looks kind of cool or actually I played Lunar Nights it was kind of fun but Boktai was not fun for me.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Take your DS to a power plant.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Or get a blacklight in your house because that thing will send that thing off the rockets.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
I wonder if a fridge magnet will fuck with this game.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Do they have those stones that make noise?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
So there you go Treasure Gaust coming to the DS.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Boy the DS now really does everything.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Well that's kind of cool though because it's like degausting your monitor by now.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
It's certainly something new.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Well here is something new but not really.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
We get more Harvest Moon.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Da award of the week.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Harvest Moon DS will be out on the 13th of April.

08:55.000 --> 09:04.000
I know at least in the UK I'm not sure if that's also playing to the US because I got my information off of UK stuff.

09:04.000 --> 09:17.000
However it's more cows and more sheep and you get tutorials on how to raise your animals and plant seeds and crops and make money on your farm.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Fall asleep while playing a video game.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
And have sex with Harvest Sprites and the Witch Princess.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm awake.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
No really.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And then you can actually get married in the game.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
You have 25 villagers and you can go fishing.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
And all they do is just nag you the fucking tend to the animals.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
You can probably you know hump the sheep or something.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
All they do is stay at home and watch Oprah while you're out milking the cow.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I have a Harvest Moon sheep.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I do.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
He sleeps by my bed with Stitch.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Gaming Nerd says I'm buying this game.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
There you go.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
John Dorian says I think Harvest Moon for the DS already came out.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't know if this is a new one.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I think this is a new one.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
There's a new Harvest Moon game every year on every platform so you know it's the same fucking thing every time.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm sorry I'm not a big Harvest Moon fan if you can't already tell.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
I find the game to be incredibly boring yet I love Animal Crossing.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
So obviously my taste in games is fucked I admit it.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Evangelicals love Animal Crossing.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Evangelicals love Animal Crossing?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Why would Evangelicals?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
You should have seen the shit we were doing in Animal Crossing.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
I got one of my animals to always say you cunt after everything they said.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Can I have a fish you cunt?

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
And then like we painted gay pride symbols and put them all over town.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Remember the girls in my village who was their village lesbian?

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
My Animal Crossing village was an evangelical nightmare.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
On my DS one though we had our village lesbian and when she moved out we cried.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
No I remember that.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
It's because I hit her with a bug net so much.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
She went to Julie's village and she was a PE teacher.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
She had gym equipment.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
That's right she had gym equipment in her house.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
She was such a lesbian.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
And so we made a little rainbow sign to be outside of her house.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Do you know why Animal Crossing is sick?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Because we're talking about these people like they're real.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
You know you liked Olivia.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
That's the one I think I got to say you cunt after everything.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yes.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
There's nothing funnier than getting video game characters to say shit and poop.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yay!

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
How about peepee caca?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Anyway.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I had one that said that.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
So, Capcom.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah, they're awesome.

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
They used to have a studio called Clover which put out such games like Okami, Viewtiful Joe,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
fun stuff like that.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Well of course you remember Clover went bye bye.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.880
But now the four members of Clover have formed a brand new studio called Seeds and no projects

11:51.880 --> 11:58.140
have been announced from them yet but of course you know features such a wonderful talent

11:58.140 --> 12:10.480
as Sushi Nabi or Naba which he worked on Viewtiful Joe, Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami and Devil

12:10.480 --> 12:18.800
McRise, Hideki Kamiya and I probably butchered those names but should be interesting.

12:18.800 --> 12:24.640
Hopefully we get some more original games kind of like actually they worked on what

12:24.640 --> 12:25.640
was it?

12:25.640 --> 12:26.640
Gun Hand was?

12:26.640 --> 12:27.960
I think that was the name of that.

12:27.960 --> 12:28.960
God Hand.

12:28.960 --> 12:29.960
That's what it was.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.360
That was okay.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.440
But yeah, awesome.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.480
More studios making more games.

12:37.480 --> 12:44.720
I have on another completely different tangent, I have the news that might save PlayStation

12:44.720 --> 12:47.120
3 and here it is.

12:47.120 --> 12:52.800
There's a rumor going around that there are because based off reports from Japan that

12:52.800 --> 12:58.020
the head of the Sony financial division is suggesting that a PlayStation 3 price cut

12:58.020 --> 13:01.020
in 2007 may be on the way.

13:01.020 --> 13:04.500
Now it seems like there's a story about this like every other week but this one's really

13:04.500 --> 13:07.880
been circulating around the different blogs so we hope there's a little bit of truth to

13:07.880 --> 13:11.480
it but the honest end of it is if there is a price cut coming it's probably not till

13:11.480 --> 13:15.880
Christmas because they'll try to lie to fire under PS3 sales.

13:15.880 --> 13:20.400
They're going to have to because Halo 3 is going to be a big problem.

13:20.400 --> 13:26.180
I would say if they want to be smart they'll cut it the same day or I mean they'll cut

13:26.180 --> 13:32.480
the price of the PlayStation 3 the same day as the Halo 3 comes out.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.040
That would be the best thing ever.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.480
We'll see what happens.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.960
Well as for other things that we're seeing happening and I really wish we weren't seeing

13:40.960 --> 13:47.840
this happen there's an Aqua Teen Hunger Force game on the PS2 and this is what you get for

13:47.840 --> 13:50.960
drinking beer milkshakes.

13:50.960 --> 13:59.600
Yeah it's a golfing game I know it's just extreme combat golf they call it.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.440
Who's story is this?

14:03.440 --> 14:07.280
Okay till it's warm at the game Jamie go right ahead.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.080
Can I say something completely random first?

14:09.080 --> 14:11.120
Jamie likes to do that to my stories.

14:11.120 --> 14:15.520
This has nothing to do with gaming at all but you know how in Rocky Horror Picture Show

14:15.520 --> 14:19.240
at the end you always have like if you ever go see it live in the theater when Riff Raff

14:19.240 --> 14:24.460
and Magenta come back into the they're sometimes dressed up as famous couples or some type

14:24.460 --> 14:28.120
of coupling like you know maybe they'll come like well I remember one time when I actually

14:28.120 --> 14:31.240
performed as Riff Raff we came out as the characters from Brokeback Mountain and you

14:31.240 --> 14:36.440
know just like couples like that well last night they came out in these giant cardboard

14:36.440 --> 14:41.440
cutouts of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and it was the best gold scene I'd ever seen in my life.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.560
Jenna is papayas!

14:43.560 --> 14:45.880
Something like that.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.680
Sorry that was that random moment was brought to you.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.760
I was just sort of in shock because I'm like it's bad enough that it's Aqua Teen Hunger

14:51.760 --> 14:57.880
Force but they have to just completely turn the state in my heart and making it combat

14:57.880 --> 15:01.520
golf with sawed-off shotguns.

15:01.520 --> 15:06.520
Um Midway stop taking the LSD please.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.800
You are not a hero.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.800
You cannot tell the future through Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.900
Lay off the drugs.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.560
Next please.

15:15.560 --> 15:21.320
I want to read some comments from chat real quick going to let's see back to the PlayStation

15:21.320 --> 15:22.320
3 story.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.280
Let's have T says PlayStation 3 needs a price cut.

15:24.280 --> 15:27.320
That's the only way that it might become a real threat to Microsoft.

15:27.320 --> 15:33.640
SSJ 100 Matt says Aqua Teen Hunger Force game the only game that won't be in Boston.

15:33.640 --> 15:38.680
To which WB Bulldogs tags along to that the Boston scare was a bunch of bullshit.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.760
Media blowing things out of proportion.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.040
Got the show a lot of visibility although I hear it didn't help in the ratings that's

15:44.040 --> 15:45.040
too bad.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.240
Well the ratings are doing pretty good as it is.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.040
I mean yeah the show is doing fine as it is so what can you do?

15:50.040 --> 15:51.040
Anyways.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.040
Cool!

15:52.040 --> 15:53.040
Megatox is going to let me borrow a hotel desk.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.040
I don't want to play this.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.600
Oh I want a game!

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
You mean book.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.600
I can't have the game.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.600
He's loaning it to me.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.600
I'm taking it back and burning it.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
Oh game lust!

16:00.600 --> 16:05.720
Neek Latov says I'm not allowed to rub the game against my chest.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.600
Do you want to say anything real quick because you haven't been on the show really?

16:09.600 --> 16:12.400
We had everybody like Grand Central Station through here in part A.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.280
Are we still talking about video games?

16:15.280 --> 16:16.480
Once in a while.

16:16.480 --> 16:21.360
We just talked about the Aqua Teen Hunger Force game and well Loki's going to be getting

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
in the next story.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.840
You want to say anything?

16:23.840 --> 16:28.400
First I'm super excited for Silent Hill the shooty game because it's got Pyramid Head

16:28.400 --> 16:32.220
and secondly I'm super excited because I got hit on tonight that was fun.

16:32.220 --> 16:33.800
The end.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.880
Maybe some chatters will hit on you.

16:34.880 --> 16:35.880
You should send your pic.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.120
Oh no you're in our top on Myspace.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.440
Here you go.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.440
Alright anyway sorry.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.440
Well fuck you.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.320
Alright sorry.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.660
So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio please don't let this

16:48.660 --> 16:52.520
be representative of every show.

16:52.520 --> 16:56.360
Every time I'm on this frickin' show you say that Rob.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.480
Every single time.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.360
It doesn't mean anything I swear.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.360
Heart.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.360
Broken.

17:02.360 --> 17:08.800
Oh okay I get to read a story now.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.800
That's great.

17:09.800 --> 17:15.560
Anyways apparently the team behind Ico is working on a brand new title for the PS3.

17:15.560 --> 17:21.220
People are hoping that it's a brand new version of Shadow Colossus or even Ico.

17:21.220 --> 17:25.500
Although it's probably going to be something original that looks yet very similar to both

17:25.500 --> 17:28.760
those two games.

17:28.760 --> 17:33.880
No word on what it is but we know that they're working on something.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.960
There's something coming soon.

17:36.960 --> 17:43.240
You gotta love gaming news like that.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.000
Something is coming.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.080
Something is coming to the PlayStation 3 and it's got a big schnauzer.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.080
It's Qbert.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.080
Perverts.

17:51.080 --> 17:57.680
Qbert's coming to the PlayStation 3 on February 22nd, hey that's this week, $4.99 undercutting

17:57.680 --> 18:01.800
the cost of the average Microsoft game by one cent.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.640
Good job Sony.

18:03.640 --> 18:07.000
And of course Qbert will have the online leaderboards.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.120
It's going to be in 720p and apparently players will be fighting against each other to see

18:14.120 --> 18:18.840
who can be the supreme noser because that's the number one personal leaderboard is the

18:18.840 --> 18:20.960
supreme noser.

18:20.960 --> 18:27.040
I'm sorry, Qbert jumped the shark when they had the Qbert cartoon although that was kind

18:27.040 --> 18:28.040
of cool.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.040
But I do love the Qbert game.

18:29.040 --> 18:34.080
I do love the fact that Sony can't really say anything about their PlayStation network

18:34.080 --> 18:36.400
right now because there's nothing on it.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.400
Nothing.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.520
There's nothing on there.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.760
There's like six games and a few demos and that's it.

18:41.760 --> 18:47.320
To be honest, the fucking Nintendo network has more stuff on it than the Sony network.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.800
I mean, come on, put out some more shit.

18:49.800 --> 18:54.160
I don't care if this is stuff that's already been on like the 360 or whatever.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.160
More games.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.160
Seriously.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.160
More demos.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.760
I mean, full auto 2 demo.

18:59.760 --> 19:04.540
Only months after the game came out, hooray, and you know what, the game still sucks.

19:04.540 --> 19:08.320
And I don't know, they just need more shit.

19:08.320 --> 19:12.120
Qbert is not filling the void that they need.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.120
More original stuff.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.760
And no PSP ports.

19:14.760 --> 19:18.040
Top it with the goddamn PSP ports.

19:18.040 --> 19:24.120
Well why don't we move away from Sony's stinky poop pile of a camp and go to the Nintendo

19:24.120 --> 19:25.200
world.

19:25.200 --> 19:29.520
Although this is actually pretty poopy too.

19:29.520 --> 19:39.520
Cooking Mama Cook Off has actually been pushed back, sorry, in Europe.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.520
Sorry Europe.

19:40.520 --> 19:44.280
The original release date was March 29th, now it's pushed back to May 10th.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.840
They are not listing a reason.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.200
That's really crappy, isn't it?

19:49.200 --> 19:50.200
Don't worry Europe.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.200
Mama will fix it.

19:52.200 --> 19:56.040
I had to, sorry.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.920
We love you Europe.

19:57.920 --> 20:02.720
Even though we don't like the band.

20:02.720 --> 20:07.360
Okay, well, you know, news of Cooking Mama getting delayed, even if it doesn't directly

20:07.360 --> 20:12.240
affect us here in the US, we feel you're angst, our listeners overseas.

20:12.240 --> 20:18.360
We feel you're angst, and therefore we dedicate this FUs of the Week segment to our overseas

20:18.360 --> 20:28.560
listeners.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.760
Dark Sakura, start us off with the angst.

20:30.760 --> 20:36.800
Fuck you to accidents, because I banged my wrist into a big metal pole today and I had

20:36.800 --> 20:43.960
a big bruise, and now I have a big soul and scald on my hand from your freaking tea, Rob.

20:43.960 --> 20:49.920
You didn't have to, but it was yummy, thank you.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.920
I didn't buy it.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.920
Oh, thank you.

20:53.920 --> 20:59.400
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, um, FU to having to pay $800 to buy on the talk

20:59.400 --> 21:00.400
table.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.400
Loki!

21:01.400 --> 21:11.240
Um, I don't really have anything, other than, I guess, um, FU people that can't, you know,

21:11.240 --> 21:17.720
abide by street dates, you know, I know that's a bit, you know, hypocritical, but yeah, anyway,

21:17.720 --> 21:18.720
it's an exception.

21:18.720 --> 21:24.920
Because you see, the rules state that you cannot sell it, rent it, or, um, make it available

21:24.920 --> 21:28.240
to the public, you know, in that form.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.000
Playing it is not on there.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.160
Playing it is okey-dokey, so that's all I did was play it.

21:33.160 --> 21:37.040
I didn't sell it or rent it, so I'm off scuffery.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.880
But anyways, um, other people though, even people that should know better, like some

21:40.880 --> 21:45.480
of the CompUSA's and EB games out there, it's, there's a big fucking sticker on it that says

21:45.480 --> 21:50.640
do not sell before 2.20, don't be a dumb fuck, I mean, you're not getting paid that much

21:50.640 --> 21:54.960
money to do your job, and I mean, and honestly, no one gives a shit if you have the game,

21:54.960 --> 21:57.360
you know, days before everybody else.

21:57.360 --> 22:02.600
No one's gonna forget it, you know, down the line anyways, so, who gives a crap?

22:02.600 --> 22:06.640
But I need more people to buy this game, so I can play with them on time, so it's gonna

22:06.640 --> 22:07.640
be fun.

22:07.640 --> 22:11.200
I'm thinking about it, but 60 bucks is a lot to spend, I mean, look how much I play

22:11.200 --> 22:12.200
Gears of War.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.240
It, it, it's fun, it really is fun.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.240
I'll think about it.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.720
You gotta bring your copy over so I can play.

22:17.720 --> 22:18.720
Alright.

22:18.720 --> 22:22.800
Um, my view of the week goes to my voice, because I'm losing it again, and that sucks,

22:22.800 --> 22:26.440
because, um, you know, for those that say I talk too much on this show, do realize I'm

22:26.440 --> 22:30.760
used to talking all day and getting paid for it for a living, uh, in the teaching world,

22:30.760 --> 22:35.720
so, uh, yeah, I'm losing my voice and having to go to my day job tomorrow, it's gonna kinda

22:35.720 --> 22:36.720
suck.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.720
Luckily I can just give my class a test.

22:38.720 --> 22:39.720
I'm off, Rob.

22:39.720 --> 22:40.720
Well, you suck.

22:40.720 --> 22:44.480
I'll be, I'll be at, at home enjoying my day off for you.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.480
Good.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.800
You have fun with that, bitch.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.800
Alright.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.800
I mean, I love you, Rissa!

22:49.800 --> 22:50.800
Hi!

22:50.800 --> 22:51.800
Yay!

22:51.800 --> 22:53.640
You're, you're inaugural FUs of the week, what do you wanna angst on?

22:53.640 --> 22:56.400
Ooh, yeah, I get to break my FU of the week, sorry.

22:56.400 --> 23:01.000
It's funny, because, um, as my friends like to say, um, after work, I love to get my hate

23:01.000 --> 23:07.440
on, but I'm having such a good time being up here up north, of NorCal rules, and SoCal's

23:07.440 --> 23:11.800
rules, for the moment, I'm an LA native, um, but my FU of the week is so funny, because

23:11.800 --> 23:16.280
I hate, I hate that I love to get my hate on, as my, yeah.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.280
Let it all out, baby, let it all out.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.280
Let it all out!

23:18.280 --> 23:19.280
I'm, like, in a slayer, what can I say?

23:19.280 --> 23:23.360
Uh, I guess my FU of the week can go to my ex-boyfriend, not because I'm bitter, okay,

23:23.360 --> 23:30.000
I am a little bit, but, uh, cuz he has every reason, which one, huh, oh, not him, oh, cuz

23:30.000 --> 23:32.120
I was gonna say that one, you have every reason.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.960
Oh, FU of the week to him too, but, uh, David, AKA S.S.

23:35.960 --> 23:41.640
Caley and big, uh, gamer, g-gamer nerd, and he likes to make anime and music videos, and

23:41.640 --> 23:49.000
instead of, and he probably does, that's why I'm doing it, and instead of going out, which

23:49.000 --> 23:52.120
is okay, because I would pay for everything anyway, and I got on the PSP, because you

23:52.120 --> 23:57.440
know why, because I am the best ex-boyfriend ever, but, uh, we used to play the green cast

23:57.440 --> 24:00.920
on the lawn instead of going anywhere, and, well, cuz I wasn't allowed to go in the house

24:00.920 --> 24:03.040
and put the green cast on the lawn.

24:03.040 --> 24:07.200
Oh, and, um, and FU of the week to people, um, with Honda's, because I love my Honda,

24:07.200 --> 24:12.360
but putting a fart can on your Honda, okay, Honda's are great, Honda's are fantastic,

24:12.360 --> 24:16.960
I love it, but they're economical, and, and, and good on gas, but they're not FU-ing racing

24:16.960 --> 24:21.840
shoes, so, yeah.

24:21.840 --> 24:26.040
And last but not least, some, uh, lesbian FUs from Chris.

24:26.040 --> 24:34.000
Uh, I have, I have, uh, two quick ones, I won't be too long, uh, one, FU to, uh, the

24:34.000 --> 24:39.960
Scientology Center for fucking roping my father into it, leave my father alone, he's old,

24:39.960 --> 24:45.360
he's bitter, and he has money, knock the fuck off, I'm so sick of those people, and, uh,

24:45.360 --> 24:47.960
FU of the week to me, because...

24:47.960 --> 24:50.960
You sure are awesome.

24:50.960 --> 24:58.760
Yeah, but, I don't, I wish I could do more for Meg D. I know I've rinsed out stuff, like,

24:58.760 --> 25:03.360
every week that I'm on here with Meg D, but she lives in Wisconsin, she goes to school

25:03.360 --> 25:08.480
full-time, she's at work part-time, and she's got ASUN coming up where she's being in costume

25:08.480 --> 25:13.880
and stuff like that, and she's just so stressed out, and I FU to me for not being able to

25:13.880 --> 25:15.840
do something to help her more.

25:15.840 --> 25:21.120
You know what, she's got, she's obviously got a gal who loves her very much, and, you

25:21.120 --> 25:25.080
know, a lot of people in this world are not that lucky, so, you know, that's what she

25:25.080 --> 25:26.080
can do.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.640
I just wish I could do more for her.

25:28.640 --> 25:32.960
I hate not being there when she's sitting there, you know, just stressed out, it's so

25:32.960 --> 25:33.960
infuriating.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.640
Oh, she's gonna come out here, and then you guys are gonna get married and have 10,000

25:36.640 --> 25:38.120
babies, so, you know.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.120
Fuck yeah.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.120
And they're all mine!

25:40.120 --> 25:41.120
They're all gonna be named Mr. Sinister.

25:41.120 --> 25:45.720
No, no, she wants a child and name it Mr. Sinister to guarantee she never has children,

25:45.720 --> 25:48.440
I will be popping them out the fucking next day.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.440
Wow.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.440
She'll enjoy that.

25:50.440 --> 25:55.840
Somehow we went from I love my girlfriend so much to fuck you, Maisie, fuck you right

25:55.840 --> 25:56.840
in your earhole.

25:56.840 --> 26:01.200
She knows I love her, I bought her a pink leather collar.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.040
I love Maisie, too, she's great.

26:03.040 --> 26:07.680
I'm sorry, I have one last fuck you of the week, and that's to Gears of War for hypnotizing

26:07.680 --> 26:08.680
my boyfriend.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.600
He never wants to leave the fucking Best Buy.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.200
Oh, Gears of War, awwww.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.200
So yeah.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.200
Anyone else?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.080
I need a new boyfriend, any volunteers?

26:18.080 --> 26:19.920
It's a popular game.

26:19.920 --> 26:25.600
Well, I don't swing that way, but like, I'll pose in pictures and stuff so you can tell

26:25.600 --> 26:28.920
your family that, you know, I've, what, at Disneyland?

26:28.920 --> 26:33.680
Yeah, I remember that girl of my friends that met you, she asked, she's like, is that Jamie's

26:33.680 --> 26:34.680
husband?

26:34.680 --> 26:36.800
That was the best thing ever.

26:36.800 --> 26:37.800
Who?

26:37.800 --> 26:38.800
Carolyn.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.800
Oh, my stalker.

26:39.800 --> 26:43.640
Carolyn, your little stalker, asked if Rob, I don't know.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.960
Yeah, apparently I was Jamie's husband.

26:44.960 --> 26:48.800
Apparently you were Jamie's husband, I'm sorry, Rob, I love you to death, but you're gay and

26:48.800 --> 26:49.800
you act it!

26:49.800 --> 26:50.800
How could you?

26:50.800 --> 26:51.800
I am not gay!

26:51.800 --> 26:52.800
What are you talking about?

26:52.800 --> 26:56.400
How can anyone mistake you for her husband?

26:56.400 --> 26:57.400
Sorry.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.400
Alright, I'm done.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.400
Alright.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.400
Back to gaming news.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.880
Because they couldn't hear him talk in the picture.

27:03.880 --> 27:12.120
In fact, on my Myspace, Chris left me a comment where I'm holding the gay lightsaber from

27:12.120 --> 27:13.120
Disneyland because it was a-

27:13.120 --> 27:15.000
I had it in my bin once.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.880
It says, use the gay force, Rob.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.000
Oh, I need to add that to my pictures now that I have 300 pictures, so I'm going to

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
do that.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Alright, sorry.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.560
Gaming news, anybody, somebody, help!

27:24.560 --> 27:30.720
Anyways, so out of all the retarded shit that come out for gamers, this has to be up there

27:30.720 --> 27:32.600
with some of them.

27:32.600 --> 27:41.760
Headshot, the energy bar, yes, you too can buy a fucking energy bar called Headshot and

27:41.760 --> 27:47.640
be super cool because you eat fucking energy bars that have to do with gaming, while you're

27:47.640 --> 27:48.640
gaming.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.800
Ooh, you're fucking awesome.

27:50.800 --> 27:55.240
And you know, while you're at it, why don't you wash that headshot down with some balls.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.760
Dude, that sounds like fun!

27:58.760 --> 28:06.880
Come on, Shami, I know I'm your husband, but can I drink some balls?

28:06.880 --> 28:11.000
You know, we should tell Mr. Spanky about it, Rob.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.080
We should tell Mr. Spanky about that.

28:13.080 --> 28:19.040
Alright, anyhow, yeah, Headshot, wow, that's something else.

28:19.040 --> 28:28.320
Oh, and that was the other thing, I believe it was this website, uncommonloot.com, that

28:28.320 --> 28:36.160
was running the story about that, and it looks so awful, probably tastes like ass, too.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.160
Some people like the taste of ass.

28:39.160 --> 28:43.640
You're like ass, well we have the drink for you.

28:43.640 --> 28:48.080
Wasn't there a drink on Engrish.com or something that was A-S-S-E or something?

28:48.080 --> 28:51.440
No, it was a type of candy.

28:51.440 --> 28:52.920
Macari Sweat's actually really good.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.920
Wait, what was it going to say?

28:55.920 --> 28:56.920
What was it?

28:56.920 --> 29:00.520
Oh, Rob D. in chat said, if Rob and Jamie were married, one of them would be dead by

29:00.520 --> 29:02.560
now.

29:02.560 --> 29:03.560
So true.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.560
That would be Rob.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.560
So true.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.560
Well, really.

29:06.560 --> 29:13.200
Anyhow, let's get into some PC gaming news, because I know it's been a pretty interesting

29:13.200 --> 29:16.960
show tonight with some very random stuff, but there's nothing more hardcore than PC

29:16.960 --> 29:22.080
gaming, because seriously, PC gamer fans are foaming at the mouth hardcore, not that there's

29:22.080 --> 29:23.880
anything wrong with that.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.840
Myst Online went live this week.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.720
This is a game a lot of folks have been like, ooh, even Marissa's gassed me there.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.880
No, Myst is not dead.

29:30.880 --> 29:36.240
Through the service GameTap, you can play Myst Online, it's $9.95 a month for GameTap,

29:36.240 --> 29:39.520
and you get access to hundreds of games, not just this.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.440
It launched on February 15th.

29:42.440 --> 29:47.120
Right now, it's only available to GameTap subscribers, but apparently, they're going

29:47.120 --> 29:52.040
to make the game available as a direct download in other countries, because right now GameTap's

29:52.040 --> 29:55.600
only available in the US and Canada, and there's folks overseas that want to play this game.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.280
Australia, Japan, wherever they are, they want to play this game as well.

29:58.280 --> 30:02.120
So they're looking into options, Turner, who runs GameTap.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.120
So that's pretty awesome.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.240
That's so great to hear about Myst so many years later.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.240
I can't believe it's still around.

30:06.240 --> 30:09.640
I mean, I heard about the sequels, but it is kind of funny, though, since the original

30:09.640 --> 30:14.640
game is very solitary and very lonely, and now you're communicating with other people.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.680
I have the parody version, though, pissed.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.680
Wow.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.040
No, I actually really want to check this out.

30:21.040 --> 30:24.960
I'm going to really try to play this and review it for next week's show, because I keep saying,

30:24.960 --> 30:25.960
oh, I've got to play Sam and Max.

30:25.960 --> 30:30.760
I really need to spend some quality time with GameTap, but I keep going back to wow, because

30:30.760 --> 30:31.760
it's crack.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.760
Huh?

30:32.760 --> 30:33.760
Add it.

30:33.760 --> 30:34.760
Or crack.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.760
Sorry.

30:35.760 --> 30:40.440
Anyway, well, just a little bit of information.

30:40.440 --> 30:46.080
For fans of Gears of War who have a PC, it's eventually going to be on the PC.

30:46.080 --> 30:52.200
It was actually confirmed by Epyc's VP, Mark Raine, said that it's not just a rumor, it's

30:52.200 --> 30:54.240
going to happen, just not soon.

30:54.240 --> 30:57.220
They just said it's inevitable.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.560
I guess it's not a really big surprise.

30:58.560 --> 31:02.440
I mean, you know, it's one of Microsoft's biggest, if they want more people to come

31:02.440 --> 31:06.560
over to the PC bandwagon, you know, why not put something out for those that don't have

31:06.560 --> 31:07.560
the 360.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.680
Gears of War is a huge title.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.680
Makes perfect sense.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.720
I don't know why it took them this long to simply acknowledge it.

31:13.720 --> 31:19.100
Anyways, so there's going to be a brand new action-oriented role-playing game coming

31:19.100 --> 31:21.000
out to the PC.

31:21.000 --> 31:27.080
Silver Fall by Atari and Monte Cristo Games is finally gone gold.

31:27.080 --> 31:32.360
It's scheduled to be released on March 20th and will retail for $39.95.

31:32.360 --> 31:37.560
It actually looks pretty cool, kind of a little fantasy mixed with technology type of role-playing

31:37.560 --> 31:38.560
game.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.720
It's kind of like a Final Fantasy.

31:39.720 --> 31:46.280
Plus, the cover has boobs on it, so you got to buy it because of the boobies, you know.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.280
What do you think, Jamie?

31:48.280 --> 31:50.280
Let me see.

31:50.280 --> 31:56.320
Not bad, she probably has back problems.

31:56.320 --> 32:06.280
Well, if you've been wanting to make a boob out of yourself, you might want to check out

32:06.280 --> 32:13.240
Rayman Raving Rabbids on the Xbox 360 because it's going to be using the vision camera.

32:13.240 --> 32:19.240
There will be gesture-based games for 37 of the minigames in Rayman Raving Rabbids.

32:19.240 --> 32:22.400
So that's, I guess, its answer to, you know, the Wii, because it's not going to have the

32:22.400 --> 32:24.440
Wii controls, so that's something a little different.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.440
So there you have it.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.320
You know, where the Wii does not have a camera, now you're going to get this on the Xbox 360.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.320
That's going to be interesting.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.320
That's going to work fantastic.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.320
Yeah, I know.

32:31.320 --> 32:38.840
Those camera games are not that great, but Rayman Raving Rabbids doesn't exactly have

32:38.840 --> 32:43.520
a lot of, like, I would think in translating some of those games, there's not a lot of

32:43.520 --> 32:47.600
motion-intensive stuff in that game, you know what I mean?

32:47.600 --> 32:51.040
Like I can't imagine there would be that much motion.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.720
There's a lot of motion going on in that game.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.160
Never mind, forget it.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.160
Just don't buy it.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.160
It's a horrible game.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.160
Alright, I'll do that.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.160
I'll do that.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.160
Let's see.

33:01.160 --> 33:08.960
Let's go on to Dark Sockra's website of the week.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.880
I was reading, I was trying to see if there was good chat comments, sorry if I sounded

33:11.880 --> 33:12.880
a spy track.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.880
No, they're talking about breasts.

33:13.880 --> 33:14.880
They're all talking about boobs.

33:14.880 --> 33:21.160
Although, I do have to say, like, holy shit, it's Boobs Get in the Car from GS68.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.800
My rebuttal to that was going to the Boobs BRB.

33:23.800 --> 33:28.240
Alright, well, I also want to hear your rebuttal to the website of the week, because every

33:28.240 --> 33:33.280
week Dark Sockra surfs the website up and down and left and right to find her favorite

33:33.280 --> 33:34.280
website.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.160
I don't know if it will be Doctor Who related this week.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.280
We will soon find out.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.280
Here we go.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.280
Yes, she does surf the website up and down.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.280
Did I say the web?

33:42.280 --> 33:43.280
Shut up.

33:43.280 --> 33:47.280
The website of the week is the Orange Dogs Radio Forum.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.280
No.

33:48.280 --> 33:53.360
You know, Rob, Rob, stop the music, stop the music.

33:53.360 --> 34:01.240
The website of the week is very personal to me, very important, and you know, I think

34:01.240 --> 34:05.520
that we're forgetting the presence of greatness in our lives.

34:05.520 --> 34:11.960
We should all bow down and pay homage to our Lord and Master, the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

34:11.960 --> 34:17.040
Bless him, he has fostered us, Robin!

34:17.040 --> 34:19.920
Oh my God, yes!

34:19.920 --> 34:25.160
So the site dedicated to our noodley Lord and Master...

34:25.160 --> 34:30.920
I am a pasta-fari, and I must confess, blessed be his noodley goodness, ramen.

34:30.920 --> 34:31.920
The site is...

34:31.920 --> 34:35.240
What the fuck happened to this show?

34:35.240 --> 34:38.360
Seriously, what fucking show am I on?

34:38.360 --> 34:41.360
In the name of the noodle, I beseech thee to shut the fuck up.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.360
I love carbohydrates.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.560
Carbohydrates are so good.

34:44.560 --> 34:52.360
The site is www.venganza.org.

34:52.360 --> 35:01.340
For a little bit of history, the great one was discovered through a series of detections

35:01.340 --> 35:05.320
along the same lines as Intelligent Design.

35:05.320 --> 35:10.160
And if Intelligent Design can't exist, why can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster?

35:10.160 --> 35:14.880
Just for a brief commercial for pasta-farianism, our heaven has a beer volcano and a stripper

35:14.880 --> 35:21.040
factory.

35:21.040 --> 35:29.180
So I recommend that everybody, or just worship the IPU, whatever, just go visit the site

35:29.180 --> 35:35.640
and soon you will become one of us, because hey, if, you know, Scientology exists, why

35:35.640 --> 35:37.520
can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster?

35:37.520 --> 35:42.240
Wait, there's actually a million dollar prize if you can prove that the Flying Spaghetti

35:42.240 --> 35:43.920
Monster does not exist.

35:43.920 --> 35:44.920
There's no way to do it.

35:44.920 --> 35:45.920
No.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.720
In fact, there's tons of photographic evidence on the site.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.320
Yeah, like drawings.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.320
So...

35:51.320 --> 35:53.040
No, there's real life pictures.

35:53.040 --> 35:58.360
If we go out to dinner at the Olive Garden, and I decide I don't like my food, because

35:58.360 --> 36:01.160
Olive Garden's food does taste a little bit, you know, rank.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.160
It's an insult to Italians.

36:04.160 --> 36:08.200
Did you ever see that episode with the Playboy Bunnies, and they asked the Playboy Bunny,

36:08.200 --> 36:09.200
what was that show?

36:09.200 --> 36:10.200
Hugh Hefner Knows Best or something?

36:10.200 --> 36:11.200
Playboy Knows Best?

36:11.200 --> 36:12.200
I don't remember what it was.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.120
And they asked the one Playboy Boy and what her favorite Italian restaurant is, and she

36:15.120 --> 36:18.000
says the Olive Garden, and everybody's like, oh my god, what the hell's wrong?

36:18.000 --> 36:22.320
So anyway, if I were to, like, get upset with my food and pick up a big hunk of spaghetti

36:22.320 --> 36:26.080
and throw it at Jamie, could I yell Flying Spaghetti Monster and everything would be

36:26.080 --> 36:27.160
okay?

36:27.160 --> 36:28.160
Because we have...

36:28.160 --> 36:29.160
This has the best Valentine on it.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.000
It says, I love you, but you must die.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.280
Bob, the best part about Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is that we have flimsy moral standards.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.800
Can I get gay married in Pastafarian?

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
Absolutely.

36:39.800 --> 36:40.800
Absolutely.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.800
Can't you be ordained in Pastafarian?

36:41.800 --> 36:45.920
Well, you can be ordained in anything, God bless Pastafarian.

36:45.920 --> 36:46.920
That's it.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.280
I'm a registered minister in California.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.960
Wasn't that from an episode of South Park?

36:51.960 --> 36:56.600
By the end of March, I will be an ordained minister of Pastafarianism.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.600
Wait a minute.

36:57.600 --> 37:02.680
This is an episode of South Park where Mrs. Garrison says something about the Flying Spaghetti

37:02.680 --> 37:03.680
Monster.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.680
I remember this distinctly.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.680
The Flying Spaghetti Monster.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.400
It came about when someone was trying...

37:08.400 --> 37:09.720
The whole thing with the...

37:09.720 --> 37:10.720
Intelligent design.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.720
Intelligent design.

37:11.720 --> 37:15.200
You know, God invented the earth and that kind of thing, and they're trying to teach

37:15.200 --> 37:17.000
it in schools.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
It's like, that's bullshit.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
It's not science.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Whatever.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.340
You may believe it's not science.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.340
There's nothing to back it up.

37:23.340 --> 37:27.480
So these guys said, well, shit, we might as well have a pasta creature that can fly around

37:27.480 --> 37:29.440
and has a beer volcano in it.

37:29.440 --> 37:35.200
And they used the same type of disjointed argument, the intelligent design.

37:35.200 --> 37:39.120
Every time you talk about a Spaghetti Monster, I think about Pizza the Hutt from Spaceballs.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.120
Yeah!

37:40.120 --> 37:41.120
That guy scares me.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.120
He ate himself.

37:42.120 --> 37:48.440
I actually think that Pizza the Hutt is one of the avatars of his noodly goodness.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.920
It was fully inspired, I think.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.120
It's a funny sight.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.560
Go see it, God damn it.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.680
I have been touched by the noodly appendage.

37:58.680 --> 38:04.520
I think next week, we'll be changing the name of the show from Orange Lounge Radio Video

38:04.520 --> 38:08.080
Game Radio to Orange Lounge Radio from What the Fuck Ever.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.080
Sorry, Rob.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.080
No, it's all right.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.080
It's funny.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.080
I'm not going to be on the show next week, so it's okay.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.080
No, it's all right.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.080
Last week was just as bad.

38:17.080 --> 38:20.120
You know, folks in chat seem to be digging it, so whatever.

38:20.120 --> 38:22.440
As long as they're happy, Rob.

38:22.440 --> 38:23.440
As long as they're happy.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.200
I love you, Jamie!

38:25.200 --> 38:26.200
That's right.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.200
As long as the masses are pleased.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.440
I mean, we can't talk about video games all day long.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.880
I mean, you have to have a life outside of games.

38:31.880 --> 38:32.880
Really?

38:32.880 --> 38:35.080
Or else when will you ever get an orgasm?

38:35.080 --> 38:36.080
Seriously.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.080
Whee!

38:37.080 --> 38:38.080
Whee!

38:38.080 --> 38:39.080
I found that.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
I'm not going to say that on air.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.080
But we are going to get back into some gaming news.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.080
Are we?

38:44.080 --> 38:45.080
Loki?

38:45.080 --> 38:46.080
Yes?

38:46.080 --> 38:48.080
Yes, if someone gives me a microphone.

38:48.080 --> 38:51.400
Anyways, so that wonderful game that I've been playing, Crackdown.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.720
It only has 900 achievement points.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.240
It is missing 100 of them.

38:56.240 --> 39:00.120
I know, everyone pause.

39:00.120 --> 39:05.360
That's tragic news, but they are coming later on in a free downloadable thing.

39:05.360 --> 39:09.380
What they're going to be doing for the last 100 points, well, they don't really know yet.

39:09.380 --> 39:13.180
What they're doing is watching how people play the game, kind of like a Big Brother

39:13.180 --> 39:17.440
sort of thing, and they're going to figure out some achievements based on that.

39:17.440 --> 39:23.760
So for example, if you're into say, kicking objects really high into the air with your

39:23.760 --> 39:29.800
character, like say pipes on a rooftop, into oncoming traffic or stuff like that, that

39:29.800 --> 39:31.720
could become an achievement later on.

39:31.720 --> 39:36.080
Or I don't know, punting people over a bridge or something, I don't know.

39:36.080 --> 39:40.860
As long as there's not some dumbass achievement for 1,000 people in the lobby at once.

39:40.860 --> 39:42.880
I don't think there is a lobby in this game.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.160
I know, but I'm making reference to that one.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
Yes, that's retarded.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.160
That was stupid.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.160
Do you know why they did that?

39:48.160 --> 39:51.040
Because they were hoping they sold 1,000 copies of NBA Live or something.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.480
Well apparently they did, because the community came together and got it done.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.480
Good job.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.480
Yeah, worldwide.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.920
I don't know.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.720
All bought by Achievement Point Horse.

40:01.720 --> 40:04.880
To be honest though, Crackdown's achievements, they're not that hard.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.880
They're pretty easy.

40:06.880 --> 40:13.660
Well, I know Loki likes Crackdown a whole lot, but there's only a few things I can think

40:13.660 --> 40:16.000
of that are even better than Crackdown, Loki must agree.

40:16.000 --> 40:32.240
Now one of them would be zombies, and there's only one thing better than zombies, believe

40:32.240 --> 40:36.040
it or not, and that would be Hideo Kojima.

40:36.040 --> 40:42.880
Would you believe that the meeting of this awesomeness, these two worlds of awesome could

40:42.880 --> 40:53.400
be in the near future?

40:53.400 --> 40:56.240
The zombie idea I have is a bit different.

40:56.240 --> 40:59.400
Imagine a large town where half the inhabitants are zombies.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.440
Users would subscribe, get inside the town, and get bitten.

41:02.440 --> 41:05.560
At that stage they become undead and can't control their character.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.660
All they can do is modify the camera angles.

41:07.660 --> 41:11.160
They would see their character attacking humans and have to pay to just watch.

41:11.160 --> 41:14.920
The only way they could end it is by opening another account, hunting themselves down and

41:14.920 --> 41:16.340
killing themselves.

41:16.340 --> 41:19.360
Of course, the problem is that your second character can get bitten as well.

41:19.360 --> 41:22.320
Wasn't this already done in a Resident Evil game?

41:22.320 --> 41:25.960
I think of Infected for PSP for some reason.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.960
I want to say a Resident Evil game that was played online.

41:28.960 --> 41:29.960
Outbreak?

41:29.960 --> 41:34.560
Yeah, I think it might have been Outbreak, where if you did get bitten or whatever,

41:34.560 --> 41:36.820
that you wouldn't be able to control your character or something like that.

41:36.820 --> 41:40.960
I want to say that that was Outbreak.

41:40.960 --> 41:45.280
Well Hideo Kojima says, quote, he's going to take some time to prepare a zombie title

41:45.280 --> 41:46.440
if the timing's right.

41:46.440 --> 41:47.440
Just take that very seriously.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.260
Listen, here's what you need to do, and I'm telling you, this is going to be way better

41:50.260 --> 41:52.560
than that stupid zombie game.

41:52.560 --> 41:59.080
Okay, Hideo Kojima's Adventures in Nudie Island, because you're going to have, picture this,

41:59.080 --> 42:04.160
half the residents, hot naked chicks, okay?

42:04.160 --> 42:08.680
You would have people subscribing four times just to have four different people in this

42:08.680 --> 42:13.840
fucking island, and I tell you, that is going to be better than any fucking zombie game

42:13.840 --> 42:14.840
ever.

42:14.840 --> 42:15.840
Beauty and the Geek MMO?

42:15.840 --> 42:16.840
And you know what happens?

42:16.840 --> 42:22.880
And if you get bitten by the naked chicks, if you're into that kind of thing, then you

42:22.880 --> 42:24.560
turn into another naked chick or something.

42:24.560 --> 42:28.720
Isn't the downside, though, that half of those quote-unquote naked chicks are men playing

42:28.720 --> 42:30.720
as naked chicks?

42:30.720 --> 42:34.160
That would be me.

42:34.160 --> 42:38.360
I always play women in MMOs, always.

42:38.360 --> 42:43.400
That's why, I don't know, the naked chicks would be only controlled by AI, so it'd never

42:43.400 --> 42:44.400
be men playing.

42:44.400 --> 42:47.120
Oh, so you're never actually having real sex, ever?

42:47.120 --> 42:49.720
It doesn't matter, you're never having real sex in this game anyways.

42:49.720 --> 42:52.480
If you want real sex, go and fucking get a woman.

42:52.480 --> 42:56.080
Festering Rash in our chat, which I believe is just DMN under a different name, says,

42:56.080 --> 42:58.360
Loki, it's called Second Life.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.520
Oh!

42:59.520 --> 43:00.520
Touche.

43:00.520 --> 43:10.280
What they need to do is seriously, Tecmo needs to partner with Girls Gone Wild in his fucking

43:10.280 --> 43:19.320
DOA Xtreme 3, or Girls Gone Wild- Who's that guy who makes Dead or Alive, Itagaki?

43:19.320 --> 43:24.360
Oh my god, he needs to do something like, how much do I have to pay him, though, to

43:24.360 --> 43:26.160
put in a little gay content?

43:26.160 --> 43:31.000
Not lesbians, sorry Chris, but like, you know, a hardcore, like, guy-on-guy action.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Did you say sorry to me?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
No, I said Chris.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.640
Because it's probably Shane, like- No, not Shane, I'm sorry you're here.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.040
I'm sorry you're here.

43:38.040 --> 43:39.040
Alright.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.760
I love one-sided conversations on the radio.

43:41.760 --> 43:42.760
So professional.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.880
Anyhow, shall we move on?

43:45.880 --> 43:46.920
Why not?

43:46.920 --> 43:53.280
You know what, I have better things to do, no I'm kidding.

43:53.280 --> 44:02.980
For everybody who was into Amplitude, who played Amplitude Online, Sony is giving the

44:02.980 --> 44:06.360
online server the boot right at the ass.

44:06.360 --> 44:12.240
The Amplitude online server is going away.

44:12.240 --> 44:16.160
It will be, I believe actually was down now.

44:16.160 --> 44:18.680
It went off on Sunday, right?

44:18.680 --> 44:20.920
I think today was the last hurrah.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.960
7pm Eastern Time, so it's gone already.

44:23.960 --> 44:26.080
Aw, that's sad, kinda.

44:26.080 --> 44:31.280
That's so sad that a game that's a few years old loses its online content.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.520
Buy a new game!

44:33.520 --> 44:36.280
How about they make one as good as Amplitude?

44:36.280 --> 44:37.420
That would be awesome.

44:37.420 --> 44:41.360
Give me Guitar Hero Online.

44:41.360 --> 44:42.360
You jerk.

44:42.360 --> 44:46.720
I don't care if Marissa hates Guitar Hero, I'd play it.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.680
I liked Amplitude and I did play it online.

44:48.680 --> 44:52.120
Of course, not two years.

44:52.120 --> 44:54.320
Lately I have, Chris.

44:54.320 --> 44:57.760
Okay, this is not the Let's Cry About Rob Not Getting Laid show.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.080
Hey, guess what?

44:59.080 --> 45:00.080
What?

45:00.080 --> 45:07.120
If you thought that Gran Turismo HD was an awesome preview of what Gran Turismo 5 may

45:07.120 --> 45:11.560
be someday, whenever the fuck it comes out, well guess what?

45:11.560 --> 45:17.920
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is coming out later this year and it's supposed to be yet another

45:17.920 --> 45:21.720
fucking demo of what Gran Turismo 5 is gonna be.

45:21.720 --> 45:22.720
Hurrah.

45:22.720 --> 45:28.560
And actually, they were saying that if, I think the original Gran Turismo 4 Prologue,

45:28.560 --> 45:30.600
you actually have to buy that.

45:30.600 --> 45:35.540
So I don't know, great, another fucking demo of Gran Turismo.

45:35.540 --> 45:36.540
Guess what?

45:36.540 --> 45:37.540
The first one sucked.

45:37.540 --> 45:38.540
I didn't like it.

45:38.540 --> 45:41.400
And the second one, probably not gonna download it.

45:41.400 --> 45:44.520
Gran Turismo 5, probably not gonna buy it.

45:44.520 --> 45:49.120
So hooray.

45:49.120 --> 45:54.260
James Patrick in chat, commenting on the MMO thing, says a Mass Effect will probably have

45:54.260 --> 45:55.260
gay romance.

45:55.260 --> 45:56.800
Is Skye looking forward to that?

45:56.800 --> 46:01.200
No, because as I said earlier, I always play chicks and MMOs because everybody's nicer

46:01.200 --> 46:04.800
to you when you're a chick in an MMO and I don't wanna do a lesbian thing.

46:04.800 --> 46:05.800
That's gross.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.800
Yeah, World of Warcraft people.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.520
Yeah, first of all, fuck you.

46:10.520 --> 46:12.520
Second of all- Right now?

46:12.520 --> 46:14.680
Yeah, right now, Rob.

46:14.680 --> 46:18.720
Punch fans back on.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.880
There's our random ahh from Exeter.

46:20.880 --> 46:25.520
Don't tell anyone that you're a lesbian on WoW, or that you have a character, because

46:25.520 --> 46:29.260
I swear to God, they will not shut up.

46:29.260 --> 46:33.160
All the guys around you will go, ooh, lesbians, cool.

46:33.160 --> 46:37.720
And everybody else will go, that's against God.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.840
Noobs.

46:40.840 --> 46:45.080
I just think that's a part of the history of the internets, because my father, when

46:45.080 --> 46:50.440
we had prodigy internet, went with his guy friend, who was a teacher, went into a lesbian

46:50.440 --> 46:55.560
chat room and went, hi, lesies, and were immediately booted because everybody knew they were straight.

46:55.560 --> 47:00.440
It's just something about the internet that makes people retarded with that stuff.

47:00.440 --> 47:04.960
My father, for God's sake.

47:04.960 --> 47:10.400
I almost wanna make a gay.com account right now, impersonating us a woman.

47:10.400 --> 47:15.960
I'll put Chris' picture as my profile or something, and go into a chat room and put, hey, lesies.

47:15.960 --> 47:17.840
See what happens.

47:17.840 --> 47:24.560
We were gonna do that for my ex-boyfriend, who is so totally gay, as an April Fools joke,

47:24.560 --> 47:26.520
put his profile and his address.

47:26.520 --> 47:27.520
That's so wrong.

47:27.520 --> 47:28.520
That's so wrong.

47:28.520 --> 47:29.840
Oh, and one of the gay dating sites.

47:29.840 --> 47:32.160
He needs help admitting his gayness.

47:32.160 --> 47:35.360
Yeah, he needs, he's just, yeah, okay.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.360
This show is very gay.

47:36.360 --> 47:38.320
The first step is admitting you're gay.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.320
Well we already did that.

47:39.320 --> 47:42.280
We would like to take your live calls right now on our Skype line.

47:42.280 --> 47:46.200
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, straight, gay, pre-op, who cares?

47:46.200 --> 47:47.200
We don't care.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.760
Come be gay with us.

47:48.760 --> 47:49.760
Yeah.

47:49.760 --> 47:51.560
Come talk to us about whatever topic you want.

47:51.560 --> 47:54.880
Maybe there's a topic we've already talked about on the show that you wanna elaborate

47:54.880 --> 47:55.880
on.

47:55.880 --> 47:59.160
Maybe there's something new we haven't talked about yet that you'd like to share with us.

47:59.160 --> 48:01.080
It's all in your court right now.

48:01.080 --> 48:05.760
Also, 1-877-GAME-OLR is only local in the United States and Canada, meaning that's where

48:05.760 --> 48:06.880
it's only toll free.

48:06.880 --> 48:12.040
If you are abroad in another country, we encourage you to download Skype and call us on our username,

48:12.040 --> 48:14.480
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

48:14.480 --> 48:16.520
They're all gonna call in for Maritha.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.760
We'll see what happens.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.920
Let's go to the first call, boys and girls.

48:19.920 --> 48:21.920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:21.920 --> 48:22.920
Who's this?

48:22.920 --> 48:25.520
Did I not actually pick up a call?

48:25.520 --> 48:26.520
My bad.

48:26.520 --> 48:27.520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:27.520 --> 48:28.520
Who's this?

48:28.520 --> 48:29.520
It's Dark Tetsuya.

48:29.520 --> 48:30.520
Hi, Dark Tetsuya.

48:30.520 --> 48:31.520
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

48:31.520 --> 48:32.520
I don't know, not much.

48:32.520 --> 48:33.520
I'm just calling in to say hi.

48:33.520 --> 48:37.600
You just wanted to say hi to Maritha?

48:37.600 --> 48:38.600
Is that it?

48:38.600 --> 48:39.600
No.

48:39.600 --> 48:40.600
Yeah.

48:40.600 --> 48:41.600
Oh, thank God.

48:41.600 --> 48:42.600
What are you wearing?

48:42.600 --> 48:43.600
Well, no.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.600
I so want groupies.

48:44.600 --> 48:45.600
Why do only men get groupies?

48:45.600 --> 48:46.600
I want groupies.

48:46.600 --> 48:47.600
Are you kidding?

48:47.600 --> 48:48.600
This woman has so many groupies.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.600
That's because she's hot.

48:49.600 --> 48:50.600
Are you a Dark Sakura groupie, DT?

48:50.600 --> 48:51.600
Say no.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.600
My husband won't let you down.

48:52.600 --> 48:53.600
Kind of.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.600
He says kind of.

48:54.600 --> 49:06.520
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, not at all.

49:06.520 --> 49:07.520
Dan will step on you.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.600
He's a groupie that respects boundaries.

49:09.600 --> 49:10.600
Yeah.

49:10.600 --> 49:11.600
That's fair.

49:11.600 --> 49:12.600
I prefer fanboys.

49:12.600 --> 49:13.600
All right.

49:13.600 --> 49:15.600
Well, what kind of games you been playing this week, Dark Tetsuya?

49:15.600 --> 49:18.640
Just step on the lead.

49:18.640 --> 49:19.640
I'm trying.

49:19.640 --> 49:22.280
There must have been something that compelled you to pick up the phone and call in.

49:22.280 --> 49:26.160
Was there a story tonight that particularly touched a nerve with you?

49:26.160 --> 49:28.640
Well, the AOU stuff.

49:28.640 --> 49:32.640
Ah, the arcade stuff we talked about in part A, like the Silent Hill game and DDR Super

49:32.640 --> 49:33.640
Nova.

49:33.640 --> 49:34.640
What do you think of all that?

49:34.640 --> 49:35.640
Sounds pretty cool.

49:35.640 --> 49:38.800
I'm hooked about Super Nova 2.

49:38.800 --> 49:39.800
Yeah.

49:39.800 --> 49:45.280
Did you think Super Nova was a real, like, was it, did it kind of rescue the DDR series

49:45.280 --> 49:46.800
or?

49:46.800 --> 49:47.800
I think so.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.120
Very cool.

49:49.120 --> 49:51.760
What features would you like to see new in Super Nova 2?

49:51.760 --> 49:55.640
I mean, just new songs, or what would you like to see Konami do with Super Nova 2?

49:55.640 --> 50:01.120
Well, affecting the new songs, they should probably put in the link mode.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.000
Ah, link mode.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.280
Ah, so like you can use your memory card from the home version on the arcade.

50:07.280 --> 50:08.280
That's a good idea.

50:08.280 --> 50:10.000
Hopefully it'll happen.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Do you like to track your data?

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Yeah.

50:13.000 --> 50:19.840
Act Deft, who changed his name to Act Deft Marissa Fan in chat, says, remember to put

50:19.840 --> 50:20.840
in link mode.

50:20.840 --> 50:21.840
Very cool.

50:21.840 --> 50:22.840
Very cool.

50:22.840 --> 50:25.720
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dr. Tzuyu?

50:25.720 --> 50:28.400
I just thought that Silent Hill game was cool.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.400
Yeah, it does.

50:29.400 --> 50:33.360
What, what, what, do you think Silent Hill's going to work as a first person shooter?

50:33.360 --> 50:34.360
It might.

50:34.360 --> 50:37.640
I guess we'll see when we play the game, huh?

50:37.640 --> 50:38.640
Yeah.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.240
Do you think the graphics look okay?

50:40.240 --> 50:45.160
I mean, Dark Chakra was kind of knocking the graphics earlier, saying that, you know, PlayStation

50:45.160 --> 50:46.160
2 had better graphics.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.160
What do you think?

50:47.160 --> 50:48.160
Right.

50:48.160 --> 50:51.200
No, no, they look pretty good.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.200
Kind of atmospheric.

50:52.200 --> 50:53.200
Atmospheric.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.200
Yeah.

50:54.200 --> 50:55.200
All right.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.200
Well, Dr. Tzuyu, thanks so much for your call.

50:56.200 --> 50:58.360
We've got to take some other calls, though, but have a good one, okay, buddy?

50:58.360 --> 50:59.360
I will.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.360
Yeah.

51:00.360 --> 51:01.360
All right.

51:01.360 --> 51:02.360
Later.

51:02.360 --> 51:06.040
We welcome your calls right now at 916 anymore.

51:06.040 --> 51:10.800
And I almost gave my home phone number, 877-GAME-OLR.

51:10.800 --> 51:12.200
It's 877-GAME-OLR.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.200
Let's go to another call.

51:13.200 --> 51:14.200
Hi.

51:14.200 --> 51:15.200
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.200
Who's this?

51:16.200 --> 51:17.200
Hey, it's Seisha.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.200
Hi.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.200
I just told you to call.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.200
What's on your mind?

51:20.200 --> 51:21.200
Wow, that was fast.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.200
What's on your mind, Seisha?

51:22.200 --> 51:23.200
No.

51:23.200 --> 51:26.800
I think Silent Hill's going to suck as a first-person shooter.

51:26.800 --> 51:29.800
Why do you think it's going to suck as a first-person shooter?

51:29.800 --> 51:30.800
I don't know.

51:30.800 --> 51:35.760
It's just not going to be, like, atmospheric enough, I don't think.

51:35.760 --> 51:39.960
Do you think it's going to fall into the same pattern that the Resident Evil gun survivor

51:39.960 --> 51:40.960
games did?

51:40.960 --> 51:41.960
Yes.

51:41.960 --> 51:42.960
Definitely.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.880
You know, I actually liked the second one.

51:44.880 --> 51:53.120
I got to play the Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, and I thought it was pretty cool, but I'm

51:53.120 --> 51:55.880
really trying to reserve my judgment for actually playing it.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.800
I just love Silent Hill.

51:57.800 --> 52:00.440
Mmm, but nah.

52:00.440 --> 52:04.000
I like the atmosphere and the whole ambience about it.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.880
I don't think it'll work.

52:05.880 --> 52:10.440
What do you think would make it cool?

52:10.440 --> 52:12.480
Apart from Pyramid Head.

52:12.480 --> 52:16.680
But it has nurses.

52:16.680 --> 52:17.680
I don't know.

52:17.680 --> 52:21.960
I'm just not a really big fan of first-person shooters, I guess.

52:21.960 --> 52:27.240
So if you were going to design a Silent Hill arcade game, how would you make it?

52:27.240 --> 52:31.560
I probably wouldn't make one, to be honest.

52:31.560 --> 52:33.200
Fair enough.

52:33.200 --> 52:40.080
All right, well, I think you have a fan here in studio who wanted to say hello to you,

52:40.080 --> 52:43.120
Asatia, since you called in.

52:43.120 --> 52:46.520
Hi, hot, sexy British guy.

52:46.520 --> 52:47.960
That's Rice Princess, by the way.

52:47.960 --> 52:48.960
Hey, Rice Princess.

52:48.960 --> 52:49.960
How's it going?

52:49.960 --> 52:50.960
I'm really tired, actually.

52:50.960 --> 52:51.960
It's 5 a.m.

52:51.960 --> 52:52.960
Oh, my God.

52:52.960 --> 52:53.960
Aw, and he stayed up to listen to us.

52:53.960 --> 52:54.960
I know, wasn't I?

52:54.960 --> 52:55.960
No, to listen to us, Rice Princess, not you.

52:55.960 --> 52:56.960
Okay, I'm going to go and not cry in a corner.

52:56.960 --> 52:57.960
Not true.

52:57.960 --> 52:58.960
He did ask about her earlier.

52:58.960 --> 52:59.960
Aw, that's so sweet.

52:59.960 --> 53:00.960
And he's all sexy.

53:00.960 --> 53:01.960
You guys should add each other on there.

53:01.960 --> 53:13.360
Oh, my God, we totally should.

53:13.360 --> 53:14.840
Do you use MySpace, Asatia?

53:14.840 --> 53:16.400
Yeah, I do.

53:16.400 --> 53:22.120
Oh, type it to Skye in the chat room.

53:22.120 --> 53:23.120
He's on my friends list.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.120
Oh, is he?

53:24.120 --> 53:25.120
Mm-hmm.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.120
Really?

53:26.120 --> 53:27.120
Yeah.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.120
Well, no.

53:28.120 --> 53:29.120
Hey.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.120
All right.

53:30.120 --> 53:31.120
Well, there you go.

53:31.120 --> 53:32.120
Who's online?

53:32.120 --> 53:33.120
Are you?

53:33.120 --> 53:34.120
No.

53:34.120 --> 53:35.120
Okay.

53:35.120 --> 53:36.120
All right.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.120
There you go.

53:37.120 --> 53:38.120
Sweet.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.120
All right.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.120
Because she loves Silent Hill and could talk all about the first-person games with you,

53:40.120 --> 53:41.120
I guess.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.120
I don't know.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.120
Yeah.

53:43.120 --> 53:44.120
All right.

53:44.120 --> 53:45.120
She might convince me.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.120
All right.

53:46.120 --> 53:47.120
Oh, there you go.

53:47.120 --> 53:48.120
Oh, hey.

53:48.120 --> 53:49.120
All right.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.120
So I've got a bet going now.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.120
Why?

53:51.120 --> 53:52.120
What's that?

53:52.120 --> 53:53.120
I bet Irene can convince.

53:53.120 --> 53:54.120
Oh, man.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.120
Okay.

53:55.120 --> 53:56.120
I'll give you $50.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.120
No, I'm kidding.

53:57.120 --> 53:59.120
Which is like next to nothing in pounds, right?

53:59.120 --> 54:00.120
I know.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.120
Totally nothing at all.

54:01.120 --> 54:03.120
So I guess you're kind of losing out there.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.120
All right.

54:04.120 --> 54:08.120
Well, as much as I'd love to keep the OLR love connection going, we've got to get the

54:08.120 --> 54:09.120
show moving.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.120
Sesha, you're a good sport.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.120
Thanks for calling in and staying up so late.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.120
You're a true fan.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.120
We love you.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.120
See you, guys.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.120
All right.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.120
Take care, buddy.

54:18.120 --> 54:21.120
Bye, sexy British guy.

54:21.120 --> 54:22.120
Have you ever even seen a picture?

54:22.120 --> 54:23.120
No, I don't care.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.120
He sounds hot.

54:24.120 --> 54:25.120
He's cute.

54:25.120 --> 54:26.120
That's very not superficial of you.

54:26.120 --> 54:27.120
That's very nice.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.120
I know.

54:28.120 --> 54:29.120
Yeah.

54:29.120 --> 54:30.120
He sounds really hot, dude.

54:30.120 --> 54:31.120
I saw his picture.

54:31.120 --> 54:32.120
He's cute.

54:32.120 --> 54:33.120
Is he?

54:33.120 --> 54:34.120
Note to all guys.

54:34.120 --> 54:35.120
I think he's cute.

54:35.120 --> 54:37.120
Get fake British accents.

54:37.120 --> 54:45.120
Well, next week on Orange Ounce Radio, we're going to be talking about Rod puppets.

54:45.120 --> 54:47.120
Instant softie there.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.120
Hello.

54:48.120 --> 54:50.120
Is that what I'm doing wrong?

54:50.120 --> 54:52.120
Is that why I can't get laid?

54:52.120 --> 54:55.120
I love the way you say that.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.120
Laid.

54:56.120 --> 54:58.120
Is that why I haven't had a date in so long?

54:58.120 --> 54:59.120
Your accent is terrible.

54:59.120 --> 55:00.120
That was mine.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.120
Why am I even trying?

55:01.120 --> 55:04.120
Well, let's go to another call, shall we?

55:04.120 --> 55:05.120
Better, Rob.

55:05.120 --> 55:09.120
Hello, you're Auntie with Orange Ounce Radio.

55:09.120 --> 55:10.120
Who's this?

55:10.120 --> 55:11.120
Oh, God.

55:11.120 --> 55:13.120
That voice turned me on.

55:13.120 --> 55:15.120
Hi, DMN.

55:15.120 --> 55:18.120
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you.

55:18.120 --> 55:19.120
Hi, DMN.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.120
Right now.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.120
Hi, everybody.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.120
Hi.

55:22.120 --> 55:27.120
You have to come to my birthday party, you bastard.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.120
I'll try.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.120
Okay.

55:29.120 --> 55:34.120
Something about Crackdown I actually wanted to talk about.

55:34.120 --> 55:39.120
I don't know if any of you guys heard, but a Halo 3 demo came with Crackdown.

55:39.120 --> 55:43.120
Careful, don't call it a demo.

55:43.120 --> 55:44.120
It's a beta.

55:44.120 --> 55:47.120
Bill Gates will come sodomize you if you call it a demo.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.120
It doesn't come with a demo.

55:49.120 --> 55:51.120
It will be available for download later.

55:51.120 --> 55:58.120
But here's the thing I don't get is that rabid Halo fanboys who wank off to Master Chief

55:58.120 --> 56:04.120
are basically saying, oh, my God, I have to pay $60 to play the beta.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.120
It's a beta.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.120
No, you don't.

56:06.120 --> 56:10.120
You could have done all those other things like registered and be drawn randomly or play

56:10.120 --> 56:16.120
Halo 2 for some amount of time and be the first 13,333 people.

56:16.120 --> 56:20.120
Or you could unbunch your wedgie and just wait for the real game to come out.

56:20.120 --> 56:21.120
And that's what I'm saying.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.120
It's a beta test.

56:23.120 --> 56:27.120
It's one of the first console games I've ever known of that's having a public beta test.

56:27.120 --> 56:33.120
It's like I was saying earlier in the show, even though 11 billion people are in the Halo

56:33.120 --> 56:37.120
3 beta, and I'm very sorry to Mike W. who was complaining earlier about being a Halo

56:37.120 --> 56:39.120
fan and being like the only person not in the beta.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.120
I'm not in the beta either, but I don't care.

56:41.120 --> 56:45.120
For some reason, people want to be in this beta because it makes their Internet penis

56:45.120 --> 56:48.120
bigger, because it's like I was in the Halo 3 beta.

56:48.120 --> 56:51.120
I'm doing half the Internet.

56:51.120 --> 56:54.120
It's pretty ridiculous.

56:54.120 --> 56:57.120
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, DMN?

56:57.120 --> 57:00.120
STFU, we're looking for a guest.

57:00.120 --> 57:03.120
Anybody who's listening live would like to be a guest.

57:03.120 --> 57:06.120
We're taping Tuesday night, so shoot me an eye.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.120
Why don't you have Rice Prince as a guest?

57:07.120 --> 57:08.120
Oh, Dark Soccer.

57:08.120 --> 57:11.120
I want to, but I'm actually, and I was going to say something about that.

57:11.120 --> 57:14.120
I forgot that my class that I thought was Friday is actually on Tuesday.

57:14.120 --> 57:17.120
I'm actually taking chakra mapping, metaphysical shit.

57:17.120 --> 57:19.120
This is my massage therapy school.

57:19.120 --> 57:20.120
Interesting.

57:20.120 --> 57:24.120
Do you want me to manipulate your energy, DMN?

57:24.120 --> 57:26.120
I don't have any energy today.

57:26.120 --> 57:29.120
Why don't you have Marissa on?

57:29.120 --> 57:32.120
She's welcome to come on if she wants.

57:32.120 --> 57:34.120
Wee!

57:34.120 --> 57:39.120
I say you get a bunch of girls on your show this week.

57:39.120 --> 57:40.120
Oh, no.

57:40.120 --> 57:43.120
And see how you like it when you have more girls than guys on the show.

57:43.120 --> 57:45.120
Aww, estrogen fest!

57:45.120 --> 57:47.120
I see what you did there.

57:47.120 --> 57:50.120
You kind of put your own show name in there.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.120
All right.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.120
Tune in to SDFU on Thursday nights right here on Orange,

57:53.120 --> 57:55.120
Ontario at 7 o'clock Pacific.

57:55.120 --> 57:57.120
It's a good time.

57:57.120 --> 57:58.120
Usually.

57:58.120 --> 57:59.120
Have a good one, DMN.

57:59.120 --> 58:00.120
Bye.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.120
Bye.

58:01.120 --> 58:02.120
Wait, do we have a picture?

58:02.120 --> 58:03.120
Wait, is this a picture?

58:03.120 --> 58:04.120
Yeah.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.120
All right.

58:05.120 --> 58:06.120
I want to see the British guy.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.120
I know, we all want to see.

58:07.120 --> 58:08.120
Rice Princess ran over.

58:08.120 --> 58:09.120
Let's see, let's see.

58:09.120 --> 58:10.120
Aww.

58:10.120 --> 58:11.120
The British guy's hot.

58:11.120 --> 58:13.120
He's kind of young.

58:13.120 --> 58:15.120
Oh, yeah, but he's still hot.

58:15.120 --> 58:17.120
The British guy is hot.

58:17.120 --> 58:19.120
You're going to scare the poor guy off.

58:19.120 --> 58:20.120
Dude, you're a pimp, man.

58:20.120 --> 58:21.120
We all think you're hot.

58:21.120 --> 58:22.120
He's never going to come to chat again.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.120
Look at his other pictures real quick.

58:23.120 --> 58:24.120
All right.

58:24.120 --> 58:26.120
Even Shane like randomly appeared under nowhere.

58:26.120 --> 58:28.120
I heard something about a British guy.

58:28.120 --> 58:30.120
Dude, he's got, okay, that's awesome.

58:30.120 --> 58:32.120
He's got very nice eyes.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.120
All right.

58:33.120 --> 58:35.120
Anyway, can we go to another call?

58:35.120 --> 58:36.120
May we please go to another call?

58:36.120 --> 58:37.120
All right.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.120
Let's go to another call.

58:38.120 --> 58:39.120
Hi, you're on Orange, Ontario.

58:39.120 --> 58:41.120
Who's this?

58:41.120 --> 58:43.120
Hi, Ronma.

58:43.120 --> 58:46.120
It's not Ronma.

58:46.120 --> 58:48.120
Is this Ronma?

58:48.120 --> 58:50.120
Who is it?

58:50.120 --> 58:53.120
It's Exoverr calling from the living room.

58:53.120 --> 58:54.120
Shut up, Exoverr.

58:54.120 --> 58:56.120
It's Exoverr calling from the living room.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.120
I'm so not Ronma.

58:58.120 --> 59:00.120
That's so funny.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.120
Did I sound black?

59:02.120 --> 59:04.120
No, I'm totally white.

59:04.120 --> 59:05.120
Okay.

59:05.120 --> 59:10.120
The few times that I've been on this show and Ronma has called in, he's like scratchy

59:10.120 --> 59:13.120
like he's calling from his cell phone because his, what's it called?

59:13.120 --> 59:16.120
Get off the fucking phone.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.120
Oh, that makes sense.

59:18.120 --> 59:20.120
Anyway, bye.

59:20.120 --> 59:22.120
Fucker.

59:22.120 --> 59:27.120
No cookie.

59:27.120 --> 59:29.120
I hate this show.

59:29.120 --> 59:35.120
By the way, Marissa, Act of Death is now Act of Death Marissa fans.

59:35.120 --> 59:36.120
We got to go to another call.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.120
Hi, you're on Orange, Ontario.

59:37.120 --> 59:39.120
Who's this?

59:39.120 --> 59:41.120
Static.

59:41.120 --> 59:42.120
Hello?

59:42.120 --> 59:44.120
Can you hear us?

59:44.120 --> 59:45.120
Okay.

59:45.120 --> 59:50.120
Unfortunately, that caller did not go through and it was a new caller and I feel bad that

59:50.120 --> 59:51.120
I had to hang up.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.120
No, you don't.

59:52.120 --> 59:57.120
Well, you know, I just, you know, I appreciate new people taking the effort to call in, but

59:57.120 --> 59:58.120
unfortunately we couldn't hear you.

59:58.120 --> 59:59.120
Maybe there was lag or something.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.120
Act of Death says heart, Marissa.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.120
Heart, you too.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.120
Here's also a PSA for any new caller from the show.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.120
It was Yumi.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.120
I know and that's why I felt bad.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.120
Yumi, make your microphone work.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.120
It's not what I want to hear from you.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.120
Use the power of evil.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.120
That's all right.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.120
We'll go to another call in the meantime.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.120
Hi, you're on Orange, Ontario.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.120
Who's this?

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.120
This is a long time listener, Dark Knight, rising from the dead.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120
Hi, Dark Knight.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120
Hi, it's DK.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.120
It's been a long time since we heard from you, buddy.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.120
What's on your mind?

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.120
Uh, nothing much.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.120
I thought I might give...

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120
Oh, hold on.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.120
I know.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.120
The feedback is horrible, isn't it?

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.120
He's my Southern buddy.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.120
Okay, I'm good.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:43.120
I just want to give a little mini review on Diddy Kong, because I saw it in the chat room earlier about it.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.120
Please do, I haven't played this game yet. I'm curious if I should pick it up.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:52.120
It's okay, but like they said, it's more like a rehash of the N64 version.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120
Really?

01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:02.120
It seems like a rehash of the N64 version. The only difference is that some of the mini games will incorporate the use of the stylus.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:10.120
Sort of like how Mario on the DS, the launch title, was kind of Mario 64 with some extra frills.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:15.120
Exactly. Like I said, it was more of a rehash, if anything else.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.120
Like when you're doing your turbo boost, you know how in the N64 one you usually hit the buttons.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:27.120
To do the turbo boost on this one, you actually have to use the stylus to boost your level up to do the boost.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.120
Well, would you recommend the game to others?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.120
Yes, no.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.120
What was it? Yes, no? Yeah, you know?

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.120
Yeah, you know.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:49.120
I mean, yes to some, they're hard fans, but if you've never played Diddy Kong before or something like that, you might want to pass.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:55.120
So people that are expecting to play Mario Kart DS Part 2, they're going to be disappointed, you think?

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.120
Just about if anything else.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.120
All right, well, so noted. Anything else you want to comment on on tonight's show?

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.120
Like I said, it's been a long time calling the show. I've missed talking to you guys at times.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:13.120
Well, we miss having you call in, so feel free to call us anytime. You know where to find us.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:22.120
Yeah, usually though, I'm calling on Travis' show, and he can tell you that I have been in good appearance on that show lately.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:28.120
Travis has a great show, and all the callers just enhance to that show, no matter how good or bad they are, so it's a good time.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.120
Especially since he has a NASCAR partner, so yeah.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.120
That's Saturday nights on Orange Laundrio, by the way. Check it out, Travis Donovan.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.120
All right, Dark Knight, have a good one, and thanks so much for your call.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.120
No problem. You have a good night.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.120
You too.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.120
Later, guys.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120
Bye.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120
Bye.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120
Bye.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.120
I like hearing from Dark Knight. I like hearing from all our callers.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:53.120
And if you're wondering, and you're sitting at home and asking yourself, why do the same people call in every week?

01:02:53.120 --> 01:03:02.120
Because they can. Orange Laundrio is an open forum, and if you are sick and tired of hearing the same people every week on this show, as awesome as they are, you need to start calling in too.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:08.120
And you can do that by listening to us Sunday nights live at 6 o'clock Pacific time, or you can leave us a voicemail at any time during the week.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:15.120
We haven't had a lot of them lately, so we haven't had anything to play, but 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number if you ever want to leave a voicemail.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.120
Here on Orange Laundrio, who's this?

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.120
Hey there. This is Let's Have Tea.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.120
Hi. What's Up G? Is that it?

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120
Let's Have Tea.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.120
Let's Have Tea. I thought he said, What's Up G?

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.120
Word, yo!

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:34.120
Did I fuck up that name? My bad. I actually had a little tea earlier.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:37.120
What's on your mind, Let's Have Tea?

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:44.120
I was actually wondering what your thoughts was on the XNA.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:50.120
On XNA, the amateur development studio for Xbox. Anybody have a thought on this?

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120
Right.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.120
I talk too much on the show, so I'm deferring.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.120
I have a thought that I really haven't cared too much about it.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.120
But you're not really into the programming stuff. You just want to play the game, right?

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:06.120
Oh no, I like seeing the behind the scenes stuff. It's just I'm like, I guess maybe I'm too saturated right now.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.120
Yeah, and maybe it's like for you-

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:12.120
But I go looking for behind the scenes stuff all the time. I just got done watching the behind the scenes of Silent Hill 3.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.120
I think I would love to see XNA allowed.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:21.120
I suppose I could pay the $99 and play some of the games that are going to come out from XNA.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:27.120
But I would like to see something a little more easily accessible where I could play some of the products that XNA creates.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.120
Because there's going to be a lot of independent games out there, and I really hope they start to see the light of day.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.120
I know it's not going to happen right away, but maybe a little later on in the year and on into 2008,

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.120
we'll get to start to see some of the products.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.120
I know a lick about video game programming. XNA does nothing for me.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.120
But I'm excited at the prospect of it's going to make original games.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:51.120
Because there's going to be independent developers, one man, two man, three man teams out there making their own games.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:57.120
I want to see some of those on Xbox Live and see what original content is out there.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.120
I mean, look at some of the games that have been developed for the web that are starting to get big now.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.120
You have Flow, Line Rider, those types of things.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.120
I think XNA could produce more stuff like that.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.120
Oh yeah, definitely.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.120
Are you an XNA user, Let's Have Team?

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.120
I'm on a few teams for 3D modeling and such.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.120
That's hard stuff.

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.120
Excuse me?

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.120
I said that's hard stuff.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:34.120
The 3D modeling is hard stuff.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.120
That's alright. We're probably having a little bit of lag.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.120
That happens because our internet is getting hammered here.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.120
I guess I'll ask you one last question and hopefully you can make this out.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.120
What would be your response to this question?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:54.120
What do you hope XNA can accomplish in the next six months or a year?

01:05:54.120 --> 01:06:01.120
I'm really looking forward to seeing more original content.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:08.120
Because most game developers now are too afraid of making something new rather than just continuing with sequels and such.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:20.120
So XNA will be able to have independent developers and small online teams be able to make something new and original.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:24.120
Alright, well good luck. It sounds like you're doing some of that XNA stuff yourself.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.120
So good luck to the things that you're modeling and all that.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.120
Let us know if you work on any games that show up.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:39.120
I think that's a good idea because it seems like, to be vulgar as I usually am,

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.120
that games are just turning into long series of porns with the same name.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.120
You know, The Pressed Men 10.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.120
Some original games would be nice.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:55.120
Again, I'm not well versed in the PSP at all, but I actually gave it to my ex-boyfriend being very stupid and very broken.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.120
I forgot to get him a game as well, but he didn't care because he was excited about everything that was homebrew.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:06.120
I have to say, that is some amazing insight from a casual gamer that games are starting to sound like porn titles.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.120
Because you're kind of right, and I've never thought about it that way before, but it's kind of true.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.120
Cooking mama.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.120
Let's poke mama's steak.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.120
Alright, let's have tea.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.120
Thanks so much for the call, okay buddy?

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.120
Of course.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.120
Have a good one.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.120
I can't believe I called him What's Up G.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.120
That's what it sounded like. Am I the one that heard that?

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.120
I'm not the one that heard that.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.120
I don't know.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.120
I'm going to try another call here.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:43.120
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.120
Can you hear me? This is Uni.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.120
Yes, it's a little lagged, but I can kind of hear you. What's on your mind, Uni?

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:54.120
Oh, I was going to ask, how many people play Harvest Moon?

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.120
Me.

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.120
I played it once.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.120
Who else in here? Anybody else play Harvest Moon?

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.120
Lesbians love sheep.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.120
Anybody?

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.120
I don't know what that means, but I don't even want to know.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.120
I like my plushie from Harvest Moon.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.120
But you don't really play the games?

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120
Not really.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.120
Loki? No, he says no.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.120
I used to just watch people play it, and I thought it was amusing.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.120
You got one. Are you a Harvest Moon player?

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:26.120
Yes, I am. My sister and mom got me Harvest Moon, More Friends of Mineral Town for Christmas.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:32.120
Seriously, that game is like crack.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:40.120
My sister and I would play it just to say, who's going to marry who or something.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.120
That's the priorities.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.120
Try to sell me on this game for a minute, because I'm not a huge Harvest Moon person.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.120
Why should I play Harvest Moon?

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:58.120
The first one I played, you are trying to save this town called Mineral Town.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:07.120
Basically, you take three years to sell as many crops as you can, bring as much reputation to the town, which is Mineral Town.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.120
Wait, I've got to play this game for three years?

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:19.120
No, the days last for about ten minutes, to be totally honest.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:31.120
It's kind of like that with More Friends of Mineral Town, which you're basically playing as a female instead of a male.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.120
You can actually marry somebody on that game.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:42.120
You can actually marry men when you're on the women's version, and you can marry a woman on the men's version.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.120
It's lame.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.120
No gay marriage. Can you partner? Can you get a civil union?

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.120
No, I'm sorry.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.120
We're used to it.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:58.120
One more question for you, even though you're the one that called us.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.120
What makes this game different from Animal Crossing?

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:19.120
Well, you don't have to go take the pink dresser from Cat Person's house to the dog person and then take a letter to the owl person.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.120
You just grow shit and sell it, and then you feed your dog.

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.120
I don't remember getting the sheep in Harvest Moon to say, you cunt.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:33.120
Am I right?

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.120
But you do have to comb your horse.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.120
Yes, you do.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.120
You have to comb it all the time, like every cow.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.120
Do you get to tip the cows, though?

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.120
I don't think you can.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.120
Do you tip your cows?

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.120
No.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.120
I don't think they give you that option.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.120
I know your name is really simple, but I love it.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:56.120
I just saw a thing with a unicorn today, and I geeked out because I'm a girl.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:00.120
If I remember right, isn't it based off of Yuna from Final Fantasy X?

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:07.120
Yes, that was my DDR nickname back when I was playing in Rhode Island.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.120
At least your teacher didn't name you.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:18.120
A lot of girls that are into games seem to really enjoy Yuna from Final Fantasy X.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.120
She's like a role model for girls.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.120
Her boobs aren't big enough.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.120
I'm actually a lot like her in real life.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.120
You mean she's normal?

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.120
Yeah, I know. Weird, huh?

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.120
Not that there's anything wrong with the big boobies.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.120
There's nothing wrong with the big boobies at all.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:37.120
Yeah, anyways, I should let you guys go.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.120
Yeah, thanks.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.120
Thank you for the advice.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.120
We love you, Yuni.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120
All right, take care, Yuni.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120
Thanks for the call.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120
We appreciate it.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.120
Bye.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.120
Bye.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.120
All right.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.120
I am so pathetic.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.120
We'll probably do one more call here on the show.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:53.120
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR,

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:59.120
or you can always call us on the old-fashioned Skype line or whatever you want to do.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.120
What was Yuna from?

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.120
Final Fantasy X.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.120
I've not played that game.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.120
You should. It's a good game.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.120
Well, I haven't been able to pick it up, so that's why.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.120
It's like I saw a unicorn today.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120
I was like, unicorns, and I saw her name.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.120
A unicorn?

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.120
That is so fucking pathetic.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.120
Wow, you're interesting.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.120
Oh, my God.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120
But I love you.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.120
All right, let's do at least one more call here.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.120
Hi, you're on Orange On The Radio.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.120
Who's this?

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.120
It's Raven's Coffin.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120
Hi, Raven's Coffin.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.120
I am the saddest attorney in the world.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.120
I object to that.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.120
Objection.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120
Overruled, motherfucker.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.120
I am a legal secretary.

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120
Well, thank you.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.120
Oh.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.120
All right, what is legally on your mind, dude?

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.120
Well, legally, I did get my hands on Phoenix Wright, Justice For All.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.120
What'd you think?

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.120
I love it.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:53.120
It is kind of like a continuation of the game, but hey, it's Phoenix Wright, and you also

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.120
pick it up.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120
It's great.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.120
Tell me what I'm in for if I've never played Phoenix Wright before.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.120
What can I expect from Phoenix Wright, either the first or second one?

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.120
All right, this one, Phoenix Wright's a text game, so you have to click a lot and read

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:11.120
a lot, and you have to find clues and contradictions in the game.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.120
And if you don't find things, things get a little hairy.

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:20.120
If you mess up and show Judge the wrong kind of evidence, you will go, uh-uh, not true,

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:27.120
and he will go bang, and you'll look stupid.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.720
What do you think draws, because this is a very cult type of game.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.120
Why do you think so many people are drawn to this as like a cult game?

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:40.120
Because the story is so insane, and it's like law and order.

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:46.120
If you've never played something like this, the story is so driven, it's a very story-driven

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:51.120
game, and you want to see how the story is progressing, and you know, like the Edgeworth

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.120
trial, I'm not going to give away anything.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.120
All I'm saying is holy shit, holy shit.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.120
So it's got a good story like Law and Order, like an episode of Law and Order.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.120
What about the girl with the whip?

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120
Yeah.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.120
What about the girl with the whip?

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.120
Oh my God.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.120
Doesn't she make you miss things?

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.120
I like that girl.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:11.120
I saw art stuff of her, and she was fucking hot.

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.120
Was that on like DeviantArt?

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.120
No.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.120
Oh.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.120
No, you do not go there for concept art.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.120
You go there for porn, Rob.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.120
Oh, what's the difference between a lawyer and a catfish?

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.120
What?

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.120
One's a scum-sucking bottom-feeder, and the other's a fish.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.120
Very nice, very nice.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.120
One quick thing, Rob.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.120
Yeah, what else?

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.120
All games are interactive, so I love to them.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.120
I was defending the Wii, and, well, I failed.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.120
How did you fail?

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.120
I haven't heard this.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.120
I love all games, but they almost produce too much show that I can't stay on top of

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.120
it a lot, so you have to kind of tell me.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.120
What were they saying real quick?

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.120
All right.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.120
It was a courtroom battle against the PlayStation 3, the Wii, and the Xbox 360.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:04.120
Of course, the 360 is fun because you've got a bunch of hardcore gamers in there.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.120
I love everyone.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:09.120
They're saying that, you know, if you put up a bunch of hardcore gamers, they're going

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:15.120
to pay for 360 because it's the best, and that's all I have to say.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:21.120
I defend the Wii, and they ask me why does the graphics suck, and I go, they don't suck.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.120
It's because it's based off of GameCube architecture.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.120
Then I defended and said the GameCube architecture is actually pretty strong.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.120
Just look at Resident Evil 4.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.120
I know.

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:35.120
It's not like the graphics are bad.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:40.120
It's gameplay versus graphics, and that's not to say that the Xbox has crappy gameplay.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.120
It's just that the Wii does something a little different.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.120
They're different.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.120
It's so hard to compare the two, but I don't know.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.120
That's just my thought because I love them both.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.120
I'm totally a Wii 60 person.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.120
I totally am.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.120
That's me.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.120
I'm not sold on Sony.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.120
I'm not sold on Sony yet.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.120
At least this generation.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.120
Last generation, I was told.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120
Okay.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.120
All right.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.120
Okay.

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.120
That's it.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.120
Yeah.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120
We better go.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.120
Take care of Raven's Dolphin, though.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.120
Have a nice one, and we appreciate you calling.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.120
Okay.

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.120
You too.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.120
Bye.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120
Bye-bye.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.120
Well, I know a lot of people have been trying to get through tonight, and I apologize.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.120
We're not going to be able to take everyone's calls.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.120
We've run a little long in both segments, if you can't tell, so we've got to wrap it

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.120
up.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.120
Any last minute stories here in studio?

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.120
Yes, actually.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.120
Okay.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.120
What's up?

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:34.800
Just for anyone who is a fan of Darwinia, Plink, or DEFCON, introversion is actually

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.120
stating that they're planning on putting out console games.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:43.420
They haven't really said much yet, but there is a little bit of speculation that Subversion

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:47.120
might be heading that way, which is a game they're currently developing.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.120
All right.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:54.000
Anyways, there's a rumor going on saying that the next channel possibly for the Wii would

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.120
be the Nintendo Power Channel.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120
I heard about this.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.120
That's interesting.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.120
I don't know.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:06.120
I wouldn't buy Nintendo Power, so I guess this would be the only way I'd see it.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.120
Anywho...

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.120
It better have Howard and Esther.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.600
There's also another rumor saying that a PS3 will be released to compete with the Xbox

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.880
360 Core unit.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:27.400
It too will not feature a hard drive as well, and possibly lower the price down to $250.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:32.960
I guess that's kind of cool, because, I mean, you can probably find a laptop hard drive

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.120
for pretty cheap, but whatever.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.020
Also, Final Furlong is coming to the Wii.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:44.320
For those who may not know Final Furlong, Final Furlong is a horse racing game that

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.920
was in the arcade, and when you play it, it makes it look like you're fucking a horse.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.920
That game was great.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:54.360
Hence, we used to call it the horse sex game, so in this, I guess it would be...

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.360
Hunt the horse.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.560
You know, it's bringing the horse sex home.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.880
So does this say the cowboy ride a horse?

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:08.440
Also in another Grand Theft Auto negative story, apparently Richard O. Jones, a writer

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:15.060
for Black Voice News, wrote concerns about racial stereotypes in video games.

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:20.680
One such video game he's kind of mad at is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, in which Jones

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:26.680
relates to the player who assumes the lead character of Carl Johnson, a down-on-his-luck

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:31.100
black criminal who roams the city streets stealing cars and helping gang members knock

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.400
off rivals in drive-by shootings.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.640
Okay, but apparently he didn't play the other games where he played other ethnicities doing

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.560
the same damn thing.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.560
We all hate equally.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.560
Besides...

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:50.800
Yeah, I hate nose-no-color boundaries.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.480
Everybody hates.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.960
That should be the next Wii channel.

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.040
Not everybody votes, everybody poops, everybody hates.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.360
Just a big bitch board.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.080
What do you hate right now?

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.080
I hate OLR.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.640
What do you hate more than anything at this very moment, Rob?

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640
This show.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.640
Chris?

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.640
I'm just kidding.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.640
I love this show.

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:16.320
I want to see a Wii webcam channel where you can go visit other people's webcams.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.840
The Wii Porn Channel.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.840
For people who have Wiis.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.840
Wii Wiis.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.840
PornTube!

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:29.440
Yeah, that's what I hate more than anything right now is the fact that Pornotube upgraded

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:34.520
their flash player so I can no longer use it on my Wii.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.520
Sad, huh?

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.440
Anything else from anyone?

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.440
I guess that's it.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.600
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts if we can.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.880
First off, before we wrap up the show, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.500
into and supporting Independent Podcast Radio.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:54.800
You guys are awesome and we do this show for you guys, the loyal ones who listen to us.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.560
All we ask, if you like the show, you'll notice no ads on our site.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.720
Live 365 ads, we can't control that because they pay the royalty fees so that's a small

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.640
concession but it's the site itself.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640
No ads.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640
Podcast itself.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:11.440
No ads as it stands right now and no plans in the foreseeable future, although someday

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.600
we may have to make money.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.360
We do this show at the fitness of our hearts.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.840
All we ask, tell one person about Orange Launch Radio.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.820
Even if it's your least favorite person in the world, tell them about Orange Launch Radio

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:27.160
so that maybe they'll check it out because that's the only way we can promote because

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:34.020
we don't have the marketing muscle of magazines and television channels and all that stuff.

01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:41.960
All we have is us and you guys, the O.L. Army, even Marisa Zech.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.720
Tell somebody about Orange Launch Radio and that's all we ask.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.480
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.480
Chris.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.480
We're already doing that.

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.640
Thank you so much for being here tonight.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.640
Appreciate it.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.000
What's your final thought?

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.480
My final thought is actually a plea out to all your listeners and the chatters and you

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.480
guys.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.480
Please.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.480
I know.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480
I know.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:05.200
Everyone gets tired of me talking about Megzi, but she is so stressed right now.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.360
School full time.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360
She's going to work.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:12.240
They're cracking down on her for crap and she's dealing with Asa and dealing with that

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.240
kind of stuff.

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.240
She is so stressed.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:19.480
Can you guys send her some good thoughts or some comments on MySpace or something?

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:22.360
You can go to Jamie's MySpace and find her.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.180
Although, to be perfectly honest, I would give anything to trade situations with her

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.180
right now.

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:31.720
Yeah, but at the same time, she's stressed and it's like she's not having a happy time

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720
right now.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.200
If she could, she'd drop everything that she's doing and come out here to be less stressed,

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.200
but she's not.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.880
She's sticking through school, which was a really hard decision for her and stuff.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.980
So if people can send out some good thoughts towards her, go to her MySpace or something,

01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:53.160
give her a comment or something and make her happy just to ease some of it because I think

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:58.120
she needs it because I love her and she needs happy.

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:03.480
Gaming Nerd says, God, why don't we all trade MySpaces so we can stalk one another?

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.700
Orange Lawns Radio has a MySpace and you can add us.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.320
It's MySpace.com slash Orange Lawns Radio.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.320
We're not hard to find.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.320
But if you suck, I'm not adding you.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.320
All right.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.480
Thank you and of course, you know I love Megzi.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.480
Speaking of you suck.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.520
Congratulations on your first full OLR episode.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.520
You know what?

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.400
Based on your comments you've been making, you're much more of a gamer than you lead

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.400
on.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:28.200
You follow this stuff more than you'd admit.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.720
You know more about gaming than I think you want to admit, but thanks for coming and for

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.720
your insight.

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:33.720
What's your final thought?

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:34.720
Oh, yay.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:35.720
This is so much fun.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:36.720
Thank you.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720
Thank you.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.240
Thank you so much for putting up with my ass.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:44.220
And my last... Oh, yay, hugs to Megzi.

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.640
My final thought would be people add me on MySpace.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.640
I hate MySpace.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.640
I do.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.320
To be perfectly honest with those that don't like it, but it's unfortunately a necessary

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320
evil.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.320
It is.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.320
It really is.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.320
I say the same thing.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.320
It's where the internet goes to die.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.320
It's true.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.320
I don't have a 4chan.

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.320
But you get accepted in that too.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:05.320
It's like cake or death, 4chan on MySpace.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.480
My final thought is yay.

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.200
Thank you to everybody, especially fans.

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:11.480
Even if you're just fans for my boobies, that's fine too.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.600
It's radio though, so it's hard.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:15.600
They are really big.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:25.240
If you like me or if you want to see my boobies, well, not naked, myspace.com slash M-A-R-I-S-S-A

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:34.440
M-E-I-Z-E-L or if you don't like MySpace and it's MySpace bad just like sunlight, M-A-R-I-S-S-A

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:38.120
C-O-N-G-U-S-T-O at gmail.com.

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.120
Email me.

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.120
Whatever.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.120
Cool.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.120
Thank you.

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.120
No problem.

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:46.240
We'll have to play some folk rock on a later episode of Orange Lounge.

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.240
Oh, I get so many good friends.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.240
Give the listeners some culture.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.240
I've played James Hurley on my show before.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.240
James Hurley is awesome.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.240
He is.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.240
And James Lee Stanley is my favorite.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.040
He has the best sideburns ever.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.040
He does.

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.040
He has pointy sideburns.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.040
You need to play Marissa's song on the next pop up of the volume.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.440
If Marissa would give me some.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.440
Oh, yay.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:03.400
And just to promote a friend, James Lee Stanley is an awesome musician who put a picture of

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.400
me in a Jessica Rabbit outfit on his album.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.040
She's got that on her MySpace too.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.120
Anyway, I'm sorry.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.120
Thank you guys so much.

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.120
It was a blast.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.120
No problem.

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.120
Thank you for coming.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.120
Ease up on the guitar hero hate.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.120
All right.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.120
Loki, your final thought.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.480
I got to play more Crackdown.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.000
Two of the three gangs done.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.200
One last one left.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.600
The Asians are always the hardest to kill.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.640
I don't even know how to take that comment or what kind of hate mail we're going to get

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.280
from that.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.400
Rice Princess, do you have a final thought?

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.920
I like British guys.

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:44.520
The British guy is cute, but he's kind of young for me because I'm an old lady with

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.520
a crutch.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520
I mean, a crutch.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520
A cane.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.520
A crutch.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.520
I'm an old lady with a crutch.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:55.760
Yeah, but you're still cute and you have a great voice, so bye.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.160
So cute.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:02.160
I guess I'll go next, so we'll save the best for last, won't we, DarkSaga?

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.640
As always, huh?

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:09.600
My final thought is Kirby.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.040
Kirby is my final thought.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.040
DarkSaga.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:17.040
If Meg Z is listening by any chance, you fully have my sympathy because I am right now working

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.840
full time, going to school 12 hours a week.

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:25.440
Actually this week I'm taking two extra classes and have to do 10 documented massages by the

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.440
end of the year.

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:29.160
I'm sorry, by the end of March.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:33.280
And then have to take more classes and then find a way to quit my job.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.800
So I totally feel your pain.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.680
I am suffering with you.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.960
Meg Z!

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.880
Okay, bye.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.880
All right.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.520
