0	14000	This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Loco King!
14000	20000	Tonight, February 11th, 2007, Xbox gamerscore whores might get rewarded soon,
20000	23000	an old PC gaming franchise is said to be coming back,
23000	27000	and we have some exclusive news on the Alice movie.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello, everybody out there on the Internet.
33000	36000	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	38000	We are that podcast on the Internet
38000	40000	dedicated to video gaming and gaming culture
40000	42000	and what you, the gamer, really want to know.
42000	44000	And I'm here to help you through that.
44000	46000	My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.
46000	48000	Joining me, as always, say hello to my lovely co-hosts
48000	50000	in that corner, the happiest bunny on the farm,
50000	52000	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52000	53000	Roar.
53000	54000	Fresh off the highway.
54000	55000	Seriously.
55000	57000	How many small furry animals did you run over on your way here?
57000	58000	Absolutely zero.
58000	59000	That's good to know.
59000	62000	How many SUV drivers did you run off the road on your way here?
62000	63000	Fifty.
63000	64000	All right. Good to hear.
64000	65000	Good job.
65000	67000	Also joining us, say hello to Tech Massa.
67000	68000	Loki.
68000	69000	Hello.
69000	70000	How you doing, Loki?
70000	71000	Good.
71000	72000	Did you run anyone off the road on the way here?
72000	73000	No, only in game earlier.
73000	74000	All right.
74000	75000	That's good to hear.
75000	78000	First off, I want to apologize for my sound tonight
78000	80000	because, A, I'm recovering from a cold,
80000	82000	so I sound a little bit congested.
82000	83000	I got the plague.
83000	86000	I guess in 2007 this will be the year of Rob getting the plague
86000	88000	instead of Jamie getting the plague all the time,
88000	91000	so that's entertaining.
91000	94000	You'll have the plague if you develop bronchial pneumonia
94000	95000	and lose 20 pounds in three weeks.
95000	97000	Hopefully it's not that.
97000	99000	I tried to get an appointment with a doctor,
99000	100000	but they were like,
100000	102000	The earliest the doctor can see you is Tuesday.
102000	104000	That's what she sounded like, too.
104000	107000	The earliest the doctor can see you is Tuesday.
107000	108000	This is on Friday.
108000	110000	I'm like, Tuesday.
110000	113000	Well, I hope to be better by Tuesday,
113000	115000	so I guess an appointment's not necessary.
115000	116000	Thank you.
116000	118000	It's like, ah, jerks.
118000	119000	Urgent care.
119000	120000	My co-pays hire for urgent care.
120000	121000	I don't want to deal with that.
121000	123000	Anyway, I'm doing better on my own
123000	125000	by taking over-the-counter drugs.
125000	126000	Drugs are my friend.
126000	128000	Over-the-counter, all legal.
128000	129000	All right.
129000	130000	Anyhow.
130000	132000	Oh, that only suppresses your healing process.
132000	133000	Oh, whatever.
133000	134000	Anyhow.
134000	137000	Oh, also, and then the microphone I used to use, dead.
137000	142000	Dead as hell, run over by too many rolling chairs here in the office.
142000	143000	It's dead a million times over,
143000	147000	so I have a new microphone that sounds like I'm talking out of a tin can,
147000	149000	even though this microphone probably costs twice as much
149000	151000	as Loki's microphone that he's using.
151000	153000	Which the top is falling off of this microphone.
153000	154000	Oh, that's just lovely to hear.
154000	156000	Well, then you'll have a tin can microphone soon, too.
156000	157000	My microphone's working just fine.
157000	160000	I want that, but that was donated to us.
160000	162000	I have no idea where that microphone came from.
162000	163000	I know who it came from.
163000	165000	I know where it came from.
165000	166000	I mean, I know who donated it.
166000	167000	We don't want to get them.
167000	168000	Really?
168000	169000	Because we need two more like that.
169000	170000	Guitar center.
170000	171000	Really?
171000	172000	And that's where we're going.
172000	173000	We're going shopping.
173000	174000	Any place that sells microphones.
174000	175000	We're going shopping.
175000	177000	No, dude, I got this at Radio Shack.
177000	180000	I was like, oh, Radio Shack, you know, they have like ten different microphones.
180000	181000	You need radio crap.
181000	184000	Well, I mean, this microphone, I don't want to tell you how much it was,
184000	186000	but I'll say it was twice as much as that one,
186000	188000	and it has the tin can sound to it.
188000	189000	So, I don't know.
189000	191000	I think it'll just take some getting used to.
191000	193000	Just put it up to your neck and go, hello.
193000	195000	Next week in front of me is funny.
195000	196000	Oh, really?
196000	197000	Okay.
197000	198000	Being told secrets from Jamie.
198000	200000	So, maybe we will get a shopping spree next week.
200000	201000	Who knows?
201000	202000	Wait, are you saying I should do this, Loki?
202000	205000	Hello, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
205000	207000	All right.
207000	211000	Anyway, I'm being rude and have not introduced our special guest yet.
211000	213000	So, these are some buddies of Orange Lounge Radio.
213000	214000	Say hello to Rice Princess.
214000	215000	She's been on the show before.
215000	216000	Yes, I have.
216000	217000	Hello.
217000	218000	How are you?
218000	219000	She's the one that never like talks loud enough,
219000	221000	so you can never hear her in the microphone.
221000	222000	Sorry.
222000	223000	So, Rice Princess, I want you to just yell at me tonight.
223000	224000	Just yell.
224000	225000	You fucking asshole!
225000	226000	There you go.
226000	227000	Great.
227000	228000	Hi.
228000	229000	Now we can hear you.
229000	230000	All right.
230000	231000	And also say hello to Eddie.
231000	232000	Yep.
232000	233000	That's me.
233000	235000	Have you ever been on this show before, Eddie?
235000	236000	Yeah, like three or four years ago.
236000	238000	Big, fruity, gay Eddie.
238000	239000	Casper the Gay.
239000	240000	That's me.
240000	241000	Casper the Gay.
241000	242000	Eddie the Friendly Gay.
242000	244000	What kind of games are you into since you've never been on the show before?
244000	245000	Never been on the show before.
245000	247000	You haven't been on here since we've been podcasting.
247000	249000	When you were on the show, we had like five people listening,
249000	251000	and we thought we were the shit.
251000	252000	Including us in the room.
252000	253000	That's exactly.
253000	255000	It was like the live studio audience was it.
255000	256000	We were live performers.
256000	258000	But now we have this whole internet podcast, iPod thing.
258000	259000	It's crazy.
259000	260000	All right.
260000	261000	So what type of games are you into?
261000	262000	Fantasy adventure.
262000	263000	Yeah.
263000	266000	I'm a diehard Nintendo fanboy, which everybody I guess is not as bad anymore,
266000	267000	because Wii's pretty cool.
267000	268000	But yep.
268000	270000	Fantasy adventure kind of games like Zelda.
270000	271000	It was-
271000	272000	RPGs.
272000	275000	Was Zelda like your favorite game that came out last year, you'd say?
275000	276000	Yeah.
276000	277000	Twilight Princess by far.
277000	278000	What would you say is your favorite video game of all time,
278000	280000	just so we have something to go off of here?
280000	281000	Of all time?
281000	282000	Probably like Link to the Past, something like that.
282000	284000	So you're a total Link fanboy.
284000	285000	Nerd.
285000	286000	Nerd.
286000	287000	Nerdy nerd.
287000	288000	All right.
288000	291000	Well, Casper the Gay, do you follow gaming news a lot?
291000	293000	Do you follow the gaming culture?
293000	294000	Yeah.
294000	295000	I log on to the IGN sometimes.
295000	296000	Really?
296000	298000	You shouldn't log on to those big money sites, though.
298000	299000	Yeah, I know.
299000	300000	The correct answer is,
300000	304000	I read independent blogs like Destructoid and Kotaku.
304000	305000	There you go.
305000	308000	Whatever Rob said.
308000	310000	And I'll go to Orange Lounge Radio for all my news,
310000	312000	and Augames.com, they're the shit.
312000	313000	There you go.
313000	314000	Good job, Eddie.
314000	315000	Yeah, good.
315000	316000	That's what it sounds like.
316000	317000	All right.
317000	318000	Also, no.
318000	319000	Actually, you know, as far as the big box...
319000	320000	Why is Eddie Mr. Bill?
320000	321000	I don't know.
321000	323000	As far as the big box sites go,
323000	326000	IGN doesn't bug me nearly as bad as some of the others.
326000	327000	Yeah.
327000	329000	Anyway, let's see.
329000	330000	I'm reading chat room,
330000	332000	because we also have the chat room is always here
332000	334000	to lend their perspective as well.
334000	335000	We love our chat room.
335000	336000	Let's see.
336000	337000	What do we have here?
337000	338000	J.P. Bond says,
338000	340000	Yay Rice Princess.
340000	341000	Dark Knight says,
341000	343000	What is up, our home girl?
343000	345000	You didn't say it right, Rob.
345000	347000	I'm doing very good.
347000	348000	How about you?
348000	349000	Good.
349000	350000	Let's see.
350000	351000	Act Deaf says,
351000	352000	Isn't every gay person friendly?
352000	353000	No.
353000	354000	No.
354000	355000	Absolutely not.
355000	357000	I've dated some real bitches in the past.
357000	358000	No, no, no.
358000	359000	No, no.
359000	360000	No, no, no, no.
360000	362000	In fact, we could name some on this program,
362000	363000	but we're above that.
363000	364000	I'm not.
364000	365000	All I have to say...
365000	366000	All of you.
366000	367000	No, I'm just kidding.
367000	370000	If you like to listen to the live shows on Orange Laundrio,
370000	372000	because, you know, we don't just do this podcast.
372000	374000	We have live shows there as well.
374000	376000	Wednesday happens to be guys on the show,
376000	379000	and it's our Valentine's Day special.
379000	383000	We're going to be calling some of our exes on air
383000	385000	and wishing them a happy Valentine's Day,
385000	386000	so that'll be a good time.
386000	391000	Anyway, let's see.
391000	392000	J.P. Bond says,
392000	393000	I am gay, and I am far from friendly.
393000	395000	You know, I met J.P. Bond in person.
395000	396000	He was just shy.
396000	397000	Oh, man, he's gay?
397000	398000	Yes.
398000	401000	I thought, like, he was a straight boy that had a crush on me,
401000	403000	because he was happy that I was on.
403000	405000	I was like, oh, yes, I'm going to get a boy...
405000	406000	You should know this.
406000	407000	Weren't we just talking the other day?
407000	409000	I promise we'll get into video game news soon.
409000	410000	Weren't we just saying the other day
410000	411000	when I was watching Lifetime movies,
411000	413000	because I was sick, and when I'm home sick,
413000	415000	I watch Lifetime movies, and there was a...
415000	416000	You happened to be over.
416000	417000	I was watching one.
417000	418000	There was a commercial for Gay, Straight, or Taken.
418000	419000	Yes.
419000	420000	And you were like,
420000	421000	I was born to be on that show.
421000	422000	Apparently, I'm not.
422000	423000	I'm going to be, like, the worst person ever.
423000	429000	I'm going to get it totally wrong.
429000	430000	Have you heard of this show, Dark Soccer?
430000	431000	Gay, Straight, or Taken on Lifetime?
431000	432000	It's...
432000	433000	TV?
433000	434000	Yeah, I know.
434000	435000	I know you don't watch Lifetime,
435000	436000	so that's why I'm sharing this with you.
436000	437000	I don't even have cable, Rob.
437000	438000	Okay.
438000	439000	The extent of my cable is court TV.
439000	440000	Are you familiar with Lifetime, vagina television?
440000	441000	Are you familiar with Lifetime?
441000	442000	Yes.
442000	443000	Television, vagina...
443000	444000	I haven't watched Lifetime in easily three years.
444000	445000	Right.
445000	447000	Well, Lifetime is, like, women's TV, and, like, you know, all the...
447000	448000	That's why I don't watch it.
448000	449000	It's stupid.
449000	451000	The movies they have on there are, like, the best movies ever.
451000	456000	They have, like, you know, Final Justice, the story of the woman who stood, you know,
456000	457000	in, like, you know...
457000	458000	Who stood in line at Walmart.
458000	463600	The story of the woman who was horribly raped and murdered and had, you know, a Lifetime
463600	464600	movie made out of her.
464600	465600	And had ear mites.
465600	466600	Right.
466600	467600	I frickin' love Lifetime movies.
467600	468600	Or the most recent one...
468600	469600	I should pick up a Lifetime movie.
469600	470600	Was the Fantasia...
470600	471600	You should be a Lifetime movie.
471600	472600	No way.
472600	476920	Dark Sakura, the gamer girl of the millennia, I don't know.
476920	479360	The Fantasia Burino story was one I just recently watched.
479360	484240	But anyway, my point is, there's commercials for this show, this new show they're doing,
484240	485640	Gay, Straight, or Taken.
485640	490000	It's a dating show, and the thing is that a woman goes out on a date with a gay man,
490000	494280	a straight man, and a guy who's already married or taken, has a girlfriend.
494280	498600	And at the end is when she finds it, like, she has to pick which one's which, and if
498600	503080	she correctly picks the straight man, then they win, like, a fabulous, you know, date
503080	505000	prize, like, Hawaii-type thing.
505000	508360	But if she picks one of the others, then they win a prize, and she gets nothing.
508360	512160	Yeah, because whiny straight girls have it so hard.
512160	513160	What?
513160	515560	So, is this something you would watch?
515560	516560	No.
516560	517560	Hell no.
517560	519680	Should they make a...
519680	522320	Is this a video game that would appeal to gamer girls?
522320	523320	Is this...
523320	527280	Because, you know, there's always that thing going around, like, how do we get women into
527280	528280	gaming?
528280	529280	How...
529280	530280	Because I've got two women in here.
530280	531280	I know how to make...
531280	532280	How do we get women into gaming?
532280	537540	Do we need Lifetime to bring out, like, you know, the video voyeur, the Susan Wilson video
537540	538540	game?
538540	539540	Is that...
539540	540540	Is that what we need?
540540	541540	I'm having a terrible hair day.
541540	545200	Oh, my God, that movie was so bad.
545200	547000	Video games need more violence.
547000	548000	Is that how to get women into gaming?
548000	549000	It's how to get men into gaming.
549000	550000	More violence?
550000	551000	I'd like to see more titties in gaming.
551000	552000	Definitely.
552000	553000	Wait a minute.
553000	554000	Wait a minute.
554000	555000	No, no, no.
555000	556640	We need boobs and blood.
556640	557640	Exactly.
557640	558640	More guy-on-guy spanking.
558640	559640	Wait, wait, wait.
559640	560640	I'm...
560640	561640	I'm done with that.
561640	562640	Women who...
562640	564640	Okay, you guys are telling me that...
564640	572200	It's all about... it's all about Dead or Alive, Extreme, and Rumble Roses, and Rule of Roses
572200	573520	candy.
573520	578760	It's all about sequels to the Desperate Housewives PC game.
578760	583320	Because if there's a skill that's vastly needed in this world, it's, you know, cooking and
583320	584320	cleaning.
584320	587760	All right, going to the chat room for some comments, Jared Jay says, Rob, you just crossed
587760	590640	from respectable gay to stereotypical uber gay.
590640	592680	Whatever, girlfriend, whatever.
592680	593680	You don't know me.
593680	594680	I'm down.
594680	595680	Oh, snap, girl.
595680	597600	No, that is so not me.
597600	598800	That is so not me.
598800	599800	I'm sorry.
599800	600800	It's really not...
600800	602600	That's so not you when you're sober.
602600	605160	Yeah, when I'm drunk, maybe.
605160	606160	Let's see.
606160	607480	Gaming Nerd says, my parents watched it one day.
607480	608480	It was pretty creepy.
608480	612440	JV Mon says, I hate gay, straight, or taken.
612440	613440	Let's see.
613440	616040	Padrino says, what if the taken guy is gay?
616040	617200	I don't know.
617200	618200	I don't know.
618200	619200	What if the taken guy is gay?
619200	621400	Yeah, there was the gay guy that was taken on the show before.
621400	623480	It's always a straight guy that's taken.
623480	626760	But see, here's the thing, though, and even when we talked it over and we were saying,
626760	627760	what if?
627760	628920	You know, we were put in that situation.
628920	629920	It's like, fuck that.
629920	632560	Just do whatever it takes to win the vacation.
632560	633560	We'll forgive you.
633560	634560	It's like, that's...
634560	635560	I don't know.
635560	640880	All you need to do is grab their junk and see which one gets an erection unless you're
640880	641880	really ugly.
641880	642880	Then it doesn't work.
642880	643880	You know?
643880	644880	What if the taken one is in a bad relationship?
644880	645880	I'm sorry.
645880	646880	Were we a video game podcast?
646880	647880	Because I just...
647880	648880	I kind of forgot.
648880	649880	All right.
649880	650880	Well, then I'm...
650880	651880	I'm turning this car on.
651880	652880	Games.
652880	653880	Yeah.
653880	654880	Jamie, how was your gaming week?
654880	655880	What type of video games have you been playing this week?
655880	656880	Games with boobs.
656880	658880	Oh, Dead or Alive?
658880	659880	No.
659880	660880	I...
660880	664920	My midterm is tomorrow for massage therapy, so I've actually been studying anatomy all
664920	668760	week and playing...
668760	674600	I did play a little bit of Cookie Mama just because I couldn't sleep.
674600	678600	And I was going to borrow Rule of Rose from Chris, and she couldn't find her...
678600	679600	Couldn't find the game.
679600	680600	We found the case, but not the game.
680600	681600	So, oh well.
681600	682800	Oh, I did play...
682800	687240	I actually did play a whole crap load of Creature from the Black Lagoon Pinball.
687240	689760	A whole crap load of it.
689760	694920	And oh, I also played Twilight Zone.
694920	699840	Right now, though, we're fixing our Rocky and Bullinkle machine, and we got an Earthshaker,
699840	701800	which is old-school cool pinball.
701800	704440	Well, how are you fitting any more pinball machines in that?
704440	705440	Aren't you going to be selling some?
705440	706440	Oh, okay.
706440	707440	We have nine pinball machines.
707440	708440	No, you're not.
708440	715200	Well, one of them's Will's, because we gave him, we sold him our Judge Dredd, and we wanted
715200	716480	to get rid of the Johnny Mnemonic.
716480	720680	I told Dan that if he gets rid of the Star Trek pinball, I would murder him in his sleep.
720680	723480	So we're probably going to sell our Guns N' Roses machine.
723480	724480	And maybe...
724480	725480	Aww, that's sad.
725480	726480	I love that machine.
726480	727480	Well, then come over and play it before we sell it.
727480	728480	I'm going to.
728480	729940	Because I need money for a Doffy's.
729940	730940	After the show, okay?
730940	731940	And, and...
731940	732940	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
732940	734240	You're going to charge me quarters?
734240	735240	No.
735240	743480	We need to sell them so that I can use the money from Dan's pinball machines, mine.
743480	748480	Alpha Canagram says, oh snap, Rocky and Bullinkle, oh snap.
748480	751560	I love Rocky and Bullinkle, but well, the problem with our Rocky and Bullinkle machine
751560	757240	is that we need a new, a new board for it, for a new, for the ROM set.
757240	761440	And right now the board's like, I'm going to be broken for a while and, you know, paying
761440	762440	for school.
762440	766280	I've got to decide what's more important, my education or pinball, which is really hard
766280	768120	choice, but you know.
768120	771600	Mike W says, don't worry, Mama will fix it.
771600	774880	Cookie Mama reference, of course.
774880	775880	Insert ellipse here.
775880	776880	Okay, thanks, bye.
776880	779680	You need to have Sugar Mama the game.
779680	782880	Yeah, I played that.
782880	783880	Wow.
783880	786320	Loki, how was your gaming week?
786320	787320	My gaming week was good.
787320	789800	I played more of the Crackdown demo, again.
789800	793480	I found the grenade launcher, which, you know, makes the game a lot more fun.
793480	797680	And then, what else did I do?
797680	803040	I tried, oh, I played a little bit of, oh God, what the hell is that crappy PopCap game?
803040	807840	I don't know, some crappy PopCap game that's on live.
807840	812200	And yeah, I don't know, I just, trying to get you even points.
812200	815400	I got bored real quick, so.
815400	819560	And then, let's see, played more Resistance.
819560	823840	I'm actually playing it the second time through, and you get some more weapons, so it's like
823840	828040	mildly fun, more fun, I guess.
828040	833920	And then, actually, ironically enough, we were over at my sister's house yesterday,
833920	840400	and once we got done playing board games, they popped in Driver 3, because they're borrowing
840400	842400	my PlayStation 2 right now.
842400	846440	And apparently, her and her boyfriend, their favorite thing to do now is to stay up late
846440	850760	at night playing this game, just watching how crappy the game is.
850760	855520	And it's so bad that we were actually watching my sister play it, and we knew we would watch
855520	859320	a replay of it, and the replay wasn't doing what she did in the game.
859320	864500	The replay actually glitched out, and it was, it looked like we were watching like the Discovery
864500	869440	Channel, like a video of some lizard or something, because the character kept ducking and popping
869440	873120	back up and stuff and running around, and it ended up in the water somehow.
873120	877960	And there was actually another time that she was driving, and this car falls, like it looks
877960	881800	like it drove off the top of a roof of a building and just like crashed into this background
881800	882800	all of a sudden.
882800	885200	I was like, what the fuck is this?
885200	889880	It was just so retarded, so I have to play more Driver 3 now, because I forgot how crappy
889880	895720	that game is, and probably now it's like dirt cheap, so maybe pick up an actual copy of
895720	901500	it instead of a pirated copy on my PlayStation 2 hard drive.
901500	904640	And then play it on the PlayStation 3.
904640	907160	But yeah, that's pretty much it.
907160	911480	Looking forward to playing some new stuff this week, hopefully.
911480	917120	Jared Jay says, oh god, I still can't believe I paid $50 for Driver 3 back in the day.
917120	918120	And you know what?
918120	924840	I can't believe I paid $50 for a game I played a little bit this week, Fusion Frenzy 2.
924840	928040	I picked up this game because the demo was kind of fun, and I thought, oh well, you know,
928040	931100	I love those little mini games, this will be, you know, a good time.
931100	933680	The best way I can describe this game is unpolished.
933680	938880	I mean, it's just, it feels sloppy, like all these little cutscenes are bleh, and the games
938880	941120	all look the same, and it's so bland.
941120	945600	How could a game with 40 mini games, that's basically think Mario Party without the big
945600	947860	board, be so frickin' bland?
947860	948860	But it is.
948860	950320	I was just so bored.
950320	953480	And then I'm thinking, like, Fusion Frenzy 1 really wasn't anything to write home about,
953480	954480	was it?
954480	955480	Eddie, you watched me play this game, right?
955480	957520	Yeah, I just, I came over like an hour ago, and Rob was playing it.
957520	959200	It's just, it's really generic.
959200	964600	I mean, it looks like I revamped the graphics from, like, F-Zero on GameCube, and just like,
964600	965960	you know, they keep looping the same animation through.
965960	968240	Which is amazing, because the developers are completely different.
968240	971800	Yeah, but yeah, it, to me, had the same look to it, and it was just kind of generic, and
971800	974320	like, all the different, there's, the characters are all the same, it's just they're different
974320	977840	colors, and they use the same animation loops, like, over and over again, instead of actually,
977840	981720	like, having new cutscenes, and it's just, yeah, I just think they rush through it.
981720	986960	So I do not recommend Fusion Frenzy 2, unless you want easy achievement points.
986960	990760	Go rent it, because you can get through the achievements pretty easy, as I understand
990760	991760	it.
991760	994720	I racked up 75 pretty quickly, just playing through it once, and it wasn't anything that
994720	997140	difficult, so, yawn.
997140	1001420	And I know we're going to talk later in the show about the rewards program, but it's,
1001420	1005900	for those of you guys that are hoping to get this as a reward, you might find that they're
1005900	1010480	just trying to unload the extra copies they're bound to have, because this game is not fun.
1010480	1011480	I'm sorry.
1011480	1016480	Well, here's the thing, like, thank God that the Halo beta wasn't included with this game.
1016480	1019160	Good point.
1019160	1024000	Root Beer Tapper's another game I played this week on Xbox Live Arcade, and I love the old
1024000	1025000	school Tapper.
1025000	1028280	You know, I know a lot of people have been giving Microsoft some shit for putting up
1028280	1033320	all these, like, old classic video games up on Xbox Live recently, but actually the ones
1033320	1036600	that they put up recently, like Rally-X and Root Beer Tapper, I actually remember from
1036600	1037960	my childhood and love.
1037960	1043000	So the only problem with Root Beer Tapper is that they really didn't do much to it.
1043000	1047620	They put a co-op and competitive mode in it, but it's stupid.
1047620	1050560	You don't see the other player on your screen at all.
1050560	1055960	All you see is, you see their score and how they're progressing in the game.
1055960	1056960	That's it.
1056960	1061960	So it doesn't lend itself very much to a co-op or, and they didn't even redo the graphics
1061960	1066480	or anything, so, I mean, I guess it's good that it's only $5, which is the cheapest that
1066480	1071120	Microsoft will charge any game, but expect this game to be the free toss-in on a lot
1071120	1076520	of upcoming bundle stuff like Xbox Live cards and things, because I just, I don't think
1076520	1081520	it's, as much as I love Root Beer Tapper, it didn't get the same treatment a lot of
1081520	1084840	the other games did, therefore, I don't think it's as good of a value, and it pains me to
1084840	1085840	say that.
1085840	1088600	What's, I was just, you mentioned that it's $5 is the cheapest, that's how it is on the
1088600	1091800	Virtual Console and Nintendo, what is with that, I mean, to me, that's still kind of
1091800	1096120	expensive for a game that, like, came out, like, 20 years ago, you know, they made their
1096120	1099040	money on it, they're just selling the bits over the internet, it's just, it's kind of
1099040	1100040	weird to me.
1100040	1103440	A lot of people have been making the same complaints you have, does a game like, I don't
1103440	1107120	know, Tennis, and I'm not talking Wii Sports Tennis, I'm talking old-school 8-bit Tennis,
1107120	1111680	does this game like Tennis really justify the same price as a game like Super Mario
1111680	1112680	Brothers?
1112680	1116120	Especially when I can go buy, like, a Nintendo for pretty cheap and buy the cartridges for
1116120	1122680	like 50 cents or less, I mean, it's like, or even if you want to go the illegal route,
1122680	1128040	download the ROM, which takes, like, a split second to download because it's really super
1128040	1134920	tiny, you know, only a few kilobytes, and it's like, wow, all this time that you, and
1134920	1139440	you didn't, they didn't add, like, multiplayer, no, if they added multiplayer over, you know,
1139440	1143040	their online network, oh, that's right, they don't have an online network, they just, you
1143040	1148200	know, Wii Connect 24, which just lets me know when there's a message to download, it doesn't
1148200	1151320	actually download the message.
1151320	1154680	Comments from our chat room, Jeremy Todd 1 says, I hate Root Beer Tapper, but of course,
1154680	1158000	I didn't play it a long time ago, so that nostalgia factor isn't there, but whatever,
1158000	1159800	I still think the game sucks.
1159800	1163580	Brad from Pod Culture says, I've been playing the hell out of Root Beer Tapper, fun times,
1163580	1168360	so differing opinions, I guess download the demo, see if it's something you like, so there
1168360	1169360	you go.
1169360	1174200	Alright, yeah, there's a chat room brawl breaking out over Root Beer Tapper, in fact, I think
1174200	1176280	some Root Beer glasses have just been shattered.
1176280	1178920	Why can't it just be Tapper with the beer?
1178920	1182920	Because it was Budweiser, and that was sponsored, and so you got product placement in there,
1182920	1186340	it's like why you couldn't do Mike Tyson's Punch-Out now, right?
1186340	1187340	Same type of thing.
1187340	1190080	Because he bit people's ears off, that's why he can't.
1190080	1191080	Yeah, he's a cannibal.
1191080	1196880	Yeah, actually, Nintendo is going to be re-skinning Punch-Out, and it's going to be Mike Tyson's
1196880	1201680	Ear-Biting and Women-Raping, actually is going to be coming out to the Wii Virtual Console,
1201680	1203300	for only $5, Eddie!
1203300	1207920	It's going to play like Oonga Boonga.
1207920	1210880	Get the Wii-mote and just like, thrust it in there.
1210880	1216360	For those that don't know what Oonga Boonga is, just don't look it up, just don't research
1216360	1217680	it, don't look it up on Wikipedia.
1217680	1219080	You should totally see it.
1219080	1220080	Oh man, Loki.
1220080	1222840	You can address those cards and letters to loki at orangelonestrader.com.
1222840	1225720	It's the finger up the ass for a tickets game.
1225720	1230480	Why can't we have ticket games like that over here, that'd be hilarious.
1230480	1235360	Let's see, let's go over and check in with Rice Princess and Casper the Gay, and see
1235360	1239140	if there's anything they've been playing this week, real quick.
1239140	1244560	I've been playing Oonga Booga, but like, on my own body, with someone else, but I don't
1244560	1248680	want to spend tickets, I'm just like, ooh, awesome, keep playing.
1248680	1249680	You're disgusting.
1249680	1252000	Eddie, what have you been playing this week?
1252000	1253000	I've been playing!
1253000	1254000	Okay, what?
1254000	1255000	Hat sex!
1255000	1260520	Are you guys drunk on this program tonight?
1260520	1261520	They're wearing hats.
1261520	1264640	I know this is radio, maybe we can take some pictures of both of them, but they're wearing
1264640	1265640	hats.
1265640	1270920	And like, Rice Princess is wearing a freakin' shamrock hat, that's like not even March yet.
1270920	1275400	Eddie, Casper the Gay, what have you been playing?
1275400	1278760	Yeah, big surprise, I downloaded Link the Bass when it came out on Virtual Console,
1278760	1281760	but I was kind of mad, I was like, that was $8, I was like, holy crap, but I was like,
1281760	1284720	you know, I haven't played that game in like 10 years, I should play it, but I mean, it's
1284720	1288120	like, it's cool, I love the old school stuff, but you know, it takes like 10 minutes now
1288120	1291200	to get all three pendants at the beginning, it's like, which is still fun though, I mean,
1291200	1295440	it's good old school stuff, but yeah, if Nintendo's listening, bring down your prices, I mean,
1295440	1298400	it's like, $2 for an NES game would not be too low.
1298400	1302840	Yes, actually, all of Nintendo is listening to this program, Reggie Fils-Aime is a very
1302840	1303840	loyal listener.
1303840	1304840	Yeah, pretty much.
1304840	1305840	Sure.
1305840	1308460	Oh, I forgot, I've been playing Super Mario World.
1308460	1313000	I beat it, I beat Super Mario World, because I'm awesome, I used Star World to get there
1313000	1314000	quickly.
1314000	1316000	Hey, Rob, you know, I've beaten Super Mario World 2.
1316000	1319000	Hey, Jamie, kiss my ass.
1319000	1323720	No, I don't know where that's been.
1323720	1325720	I'll help you out there, um.
1325720	1327240	You guys are filthy.
1327240	1328440	It's a tag, bonk.
1328440	1329440	All right, um.
1329440	1332360	You're being so brown, because, you know, it has to do with your butt, I guess, I don't
1332360	1333360	know.
1333360	1334360	Oh my god!
1334360	1335360	I like your shirt.
1335360	1339360	We watched the bullshit episode about the ass last night.
1339360	1340360	Video games, anybody?
1340360	1341360	Has anybody played them?
1341360	1345280	I'm trying to segue into video games again by commenting on your shirt.
1345280	1346280	Oh, sure, yes.
1346280	1347280	It's a lovely shirt.
1347280	1350400	I am, I'm wearing a very hot tanooki shirt, I'm gonna pose for the camera right now, look
1350400	1352360	at me, I'm all sexy, I'm, you know, god damn it.
1352360	1355320	You can't even see the tanooki when you do that, Rob, move your fucking microphone.
1355320	1356720	This is great radio, by the way.
1356720	1358200	No, it's not at all.
1358200	1359200	It's never been good.
1359200	1362520	We were just gonna mention my shirt, yes, I have a tanooki Mario in my shirt.
1362520	1366200	You know, I got accosted by a stranger in Radio Shack today, it was like, no, seriously,
1366200	1372600	this is how it went, dude, dude, that's an awesome shirt, dude, that is an awesome shirt.
1372600	1375000	Did you walk into the fraternity in Radio Shack or something?
1375000	1378960	Apparently so, because the guy's like, dude, that shirt is awesome, dude, I just got a
1378960	1385040	wee today, I got a wee at Target, I swear to god, I'm not making this up, and then the
1385040	1390360	woman behind the counter was like, um, was that the Mario where you, like, killed things
1390360	1392360	with your tail?
1392360	1398080	Because I'm not sure, because I've been sitting behind here all day doing nothing, and it's
1398080	1400960	starting to get my brain, because nobody shops at Radio Shack.
1400960	1401960	Rob.
1401960	1402960	What?
1402960	1406120	Oh, more pictures, I feel like a- Do you want a satellite TV?
1406120	1409440	I feel like Anna Nicole Smith, only alive, this is nice.
1409440	1414240	I'm taking a picture of Rob's shirt, one, two, five.
1414240	1415240	Ah, thank you.
1415240	1416240	It's blurry, oh well.
1416240	1419160	All right, anyway, let's get- And I'm not uploading it either.
1419160	1423280	Let's get into some actual gaming news, because we don't really have any housekeeping tonight.
1423280	1424280	Visit our Myspace- I do.
1424280	1425280	Oh, you have some housekeeping?
1425280	1426280	What do you want to say?
1426280	1430080	Well, just that you need some housekeeping.
1430080	1431080	Shut up.
1431080	1435640	Loki, save this show with some awesome exclusives, that would be, like, the best thing ever,
1435640	1439160	if you could, like, give us some video game news no one's heard yet.
1439160	1444320	How about the entire lineup for Xbox 360 from Microsoft this year, that'd be great.
1444320	1445320	How about that?
1445320	1452360	Let's start off, then, with Blue Dragon, which has been announced now for July 11th, so look
1452360	1453520	forward to that.
1453520	1456480	Project Silpheed on the 360.
1456480	1457480	Awesome.
1457480	1467080	For May 16th, Tenchu Z coming out June 12th, Two Human also May 16th, Mass Effect coming
1467080	1475280	out May 30th, Shadowrun June 13th, Forza 2 is slated for May 16th as well, man, that's
1475280	1479480	going to be a pretty big day, because I know Halo 3 is set around that time, too.
1479480	1482640	I'm sure some of this stuff is going to move, but.
1482640	1486400	And then on top of all those games we have coming out, of course, they're going to be
1486400	1491080	having a 4,000 point live card coming out in April, so if you didn't really want to
1491080	1496280	spend $20 on live points at the store, now you can spend $40 on live points at the store,
1496280	1499360	or actually, no, that's more than $50, I'm sorry.
1499360	1502720	I was kind of wondering at first why they would be doing this, but then I think the
1502720	1506360	movie rentals, you know, you can spend a lot of points really quickly on the movie rentals,
1506360	1509520	so folks that are downloading the HD movies, I can see.
1509520	1512280	Those cards sell well because people buy them as gifts, so.
1512280	1513280	I can see that.
1513280	1514760	They're like iTunes cards.
1514760	1515760	Exactly.
1515760	1517920	So, that's going to be pretty cool.
1517920	1519840	Tetris Evolution is actually coming out.
1519840	1523760	Remember, Tetris Grandmaster was one of the launch titles in Japan, now it's making it
1523760	1524760	over here.
1524760	1531080	This 360 game I've seen, this is a retail price point of $29.99 when it's coming out
1531080	1532080	in March.
1532080	1533080	Good job.
1533080	1535480	A moment of applause, please, for this.
1535480	1538360	Applause, please.
1538360	1539360	Low price points are awesome.
1539360	1540360	That was the wrong one-handed clap.
1540360	1541360	I've got some bad news, though.
1541360	1542840	That doesn't sound one-handed clapping.
1542840	1549640	Mario Party 8 has been delayed to June, or not June, May 15th, so I don't know.
1549640	1550640	How do you know this?
1550640	1553120	This is groundbreaking news.
1553120	1559960	Because us distributors talk to the publishers on a daily basis, so they will give us updates
1559960	1564600	to dates all the time, and even usually before press releases go out we get announcements
1564600	1569800	for stuff that hasn't been announced yet, or maybe announced at certain retail spots
1569800	1572800	but no one's paying attention.
1572800	1573800	Don't worry, guys.
1573800	1578560	You can play Fusion Frenzy 2 in the meantime and then poop on it because it's bad.
1578560	1579840	Because you had to play Fusion Frenzy.
1579840	1585200	Well, to be honest, though, most of the Wii games coming out now have party games in them.
1585200	1589440	I know Sonic the Hedgehog, the brand new one, Sonic and the Secret Rings, has actually party
1589440	1590440	games in it as well.
1590440	1591440	They look kind of fun.
1591440	1592440	Wait.
1592440	1593440	I have a question.
1593440	1594440	Yes.
1594440	1595440	Rice Princess has a question.
1595440	1596440	Yes.
1596440	1597440	Are the Secret Rings cock rings?
1597440	1598440	Low key.
1598440	1606600	And then finally, the remakes, Final Fantasy I and II, are slated for the PSP June 13th.
1606600	1607600	That's huge.
1607600	1609880	So that'll be pretty nice as well.
1609880	1610880	Wow.
1610880	1612760	Those are some huge dates you're giving us there.
1612760	1614040	Good job, Low Key.
1614040	1617480	So I'm just glad to see that some actual games are coming out.
1617480	1620960	I'm not sure if Microsoft's going to be stacking that many games in May.
1620960	1626560	They might try to shuffle stuff around a little bit to kind of spread out the fun, but lots
1626560	1629160	of good stuff for the summer.
1629160	1631160	Awesome.
1631160	1633640	Did you just paste that picture of my shirt?
1633640	1634640	Yes, I did.
1634640	1635640	Oh my gosh.
1635640	1636640	Oh wow.
1636640	1639000	And you can see my big fat stomach in there.
1639000	1640000	That's very nice.
1640000	1641000	Good job.
1641000	1643260	I got a cool shirt today.
1643260	1646880	Some of the perks of being in our chat room live when the show is going on Sunday at 6
1646880	1647880	o'clock.
1647880	1648880	What'd you get?
1648880	1649880	This is Captain America for President.
1649880	1652400	I love Captain America.
1652400	1656160	I want a shirt that says Reggie Fils-Aime for President, because he would regulate.
1656160	1657160	I'd go for Captain America.
1657160	1658560	And then like Link could be Vice President.
1658560	1660000	That would be awesome.
1660000	1661000	What?
1661000	1662000	What?
1662000	1665040	Rice Princess, you remember the rule in the studio is if you say something, you have to
1665040	1666040	say it in a mic.
1666040	1667040	Yeah, damn it.
1667040	1668040	Rob, I hate you.
1668040	1669040	I've hated you for years.
1669040	1670040	Oh, thank you.
1670040	1671040	I love you too.
1671040	1672040	Aww.
1672040	1673040	Aww.
1673040	1674040	Don't really touch me, Rob.
1674040	1676200	What the hell is wrong with the program tonight?
1676200	1677200	I don't know.
1677200	1680680	Oh, Fireboma says Sky needs to lose a good 200 pounds.
1680680	1681680	Who?
1681680	1682680	In related news, Fireboma.
1682680	1683680	No, no, no.
1683680	1684680	Who?
1684680	1685680	Fireboma.
1685680	1686680	Fireboma, out.
1686680	1690800	In related news, Fireboma just got kicked from chat.
1690800	1692800	There you go.
1692800	1693800	Yay.
1693800	1694800	Fireboma, you're out.
1694800	1695800	Yeah.
1695800	1699040	If you come back in, Fireboma, I'm going to sit on you.
1699040	1702360	For those who have never seen Rob, he's like the skinniest man ever.
1702360	1703360	What?
1703360	1709640	The only way your ass would weight 500 pounds is if you wore a metal diaper and you pooped
1709640	1710640	in it.
1710640	1712960	Anyway, God, what is wrong with this program tonight?
1712960	1713960	Shit.
1713960	1714960	Pure shit.
1714960	1720680	No, I was just saying that I saw a really cute shirt that was caps lock, cruise control
1720680	1724240	for awesome, and I really want that shirt a lot.
1724240	1725240	What is that a reference to?
1725240	1726240	I don't even get it.
1726240	1727240	Do you know what caps lock is?
1727240	1730920	Well, I know what the caps lock is, but- It's cruise control for awesome.
1730920	1731920	Hello.
1731920	1732920	You don't get it?
1732920	1737600	I saw this other one where the front says ding and on the back it says grats.
1737600	1740040	I really want that one.
1740040	1741040	That one I get.
1741040	1742040	Yeah.
1742040	1743040	You would because you're a nerd.
1743040	1744040	Yeah.
1744040	1746040	I've been playing lots of World of Warcraft this week, by the way.
1746040	1748040	So have I.
1748040	1749040	All right.
1749040	1750040	Anyhow.
1750040	1751440	Boo.
1751440	1752680	Let's go into some other news.
1752680	1756840	I promised last week we would have some news on the Alice movie.
1756840	1759920	This would be American McGee's Alice, as you know, being made into a movie.
1759920	1765200	Now, I apologize to the source because I don't think I'm supposed to name the source, but
1765200	1769000	if you want it to be named, then I apologize, but this information is coming from a very
1769000	1772760	trusted source of Orange Lounge Radio, somebody I've been working with for a while who just
1772760	1774320	happened to come across this.
1774320	1779360	I can't really say how, but got to read the script, the current script as it is for Alice.
1779360	1782120	Now keep in mind, these things change all the time.
1782120	1786600	So I know a lot of folks are going to sit out there and go, yeah, right, OLR is full
1786600	1787600	of it.
1787600	1792080	I reasonably believe this is accurate, the way the movie stands today.
1792080	1793160	It doesn't sound like BS.
1793160	1797080	It sounds pretty legit, but it might change by the time the movie comes out.
1797080	1798840	I'm curious what you guys think of this.
1798840	1801880	So here, I'm going to read from this, and I want to say thanks again to our source.
1801880	1804360	So I'm going to keep anonymous, but if you want me to name you, let me know.
1804360	1806360	I'll name you next week.
1806360	1811080	Alice as a child is confronted by her parents due to her uncontrollable fascination with
1811080	1812080	Wonderland.
1812080	1815960	Against Alice's protest that Wonderland exists, Alice's father takes down possibly
1815960	1820120	anything in her room that would insinuate any thought related to Wonderland.
1820120	1824180	Later that night, the house is burned down, and the only survivor found is Alice, splattered
1824180	1826240	with blood on her body.
1826240	1829400	Forward to the future, Alice is staying in a mental institution.
1829400	1835680	An MD, Dr. Hatfield, is interested in Alice and transfers her to another institution,
1835680	1839120	even though doctors tell Hatfield that Alice is impossible to cure.
1839120	1842680	Alice then begins a new treatment at the new institution, which is looking more and more
1842680	1844000	abnormal to Alice.
1844000	1846400	Alice's old meds are no longer given to her.
1846400	1850600	The other patients are deranged, but one sane doctor named Doyle seems to be the only
1850600	1854560	sane one, and Alice pleads to him for help as she claims she's not who or what she
1854560	1855560	really is.
1855560	1861360	Alice's treatments are getting worser and crueler and gets wind of Hatfield's surgeries.
1861360	1865640	After escaping a scuffle from getting into her first surgery, she follows a rabbit she
1865640	1869240	barely saw in the middle of her struggle and follows it into you-know-where.
1869240	1874280	Apparently, there were some notes on the script as well, some possible movies, because some
1874280	1878760	movie names were written on here, some movies that this could be influenced from.
1878760	1884360	12 Monkeys, 7, Perfect Storm, Pan's Labyrinth, Jacob's Ladder, What Dreams May Come, Lord
1884360	1888880	of the Rings, and then some bands were written on there as well, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry,
1888880	1894760	Butthole Surfers, specifically Chris Vrenna of Nine Inch Nails as well, Electronic Industrial
1894760	1900000	Hip Hop Music, and then this is the movie genre, Psycho Horror Action.
1900000	1901480	So what do you think?
1901480	1902600	Sounds kind of neat?
1902600	1903600	Sounds true to the game?
1903600	1904600	What do you think?
1904600	1905600	It sounds neat.
1905600	1906960	I haven't played the game, but it sounds neat.
1906960	1909520	I did years ago, but I don't remember it very well.
1909520	1911000	I watched a speed run of the game.
1911000	1912000	Did you?
1912000	1913000	It could be okay.
1913000	1915000	Yeah, so it sounds like it could be interesting.
1915000	1917440	Mention a movie I saw today.
1917440	1918440	What's that?
1918440	1919440	I saw Pan's Labyrinth today.
1919440	1920440	Oh, how was that?
1920440	1921600	Did you like that?
1921600	1923360	My roommate's been raving about that.
1923360	1928600	I didn't know if I should cry or be happy, so I just went, oh, it was really good.
1928600	1929600	Interesting.
1929600	1930600	Okay.
1930600	1931600	Let's see.
1931600	1932600	I'm going...
1932600	1933600	Except the original title wasn't even Pan's Labyrinth.
1933600	1936200	I don't know why they called it that.
1936200	1940680	The Rob D says Alice then gets treatment from a Dr. House, making reference to the TV show,
1940680	1941680	I guess.
1941680	1944400	JV Mon says, this sounds awesome.
1944400	1945680	So it could be very interesting.
1945680	1948720	Padrino says, I do believe it can be real since the scripts have to make the rounds.
1948720	1952600	I believe it's real too, but I think, as most scripts do, it's probably going to change
1952600	1954120	a bunch before we see the final product.
1954120	1955120	But there you have it.
1955120	1958840	Your first look into what the Alice movie has in store.
1958840	1960080	All right.
1960080	1962840	So how about some other news circulating the internet this week?
1962840	1967520	Well, there's a little bit of happiness going on.
1967520	1974520	For all of us who have been begging and pleading for Nintendo to do a kitty-kitty version of
1974520	1977360	Nintendogs, well, somebody else is doing it.
1977360	1980080	Crave is putting out Purr Pals for the DS.
1980080	1985520	You can choose 40 breeds of kitties, and pet them, and love them, and call them George,
1985520	1992160	and you can raise them, you know.
1992160	1994280	It's funny this mentions modifying cat behavior.
1994280	1995280	No.
1995280	1997080	You just call them modified cats.
1997080	1998080	Cats modify your behavior.
1998080	2002280	Am I the only one disappointed that they did not call this Pussy Pals?
2002280	2005000	Yes, you are.
2005000	2008080	I love that this article put up a cat macro, though.
2008080	2011840	It says, where is your god now?
2011840	2014200	Are you going to be picking up Purr Pals?
2014200	2015200	Probably.
2015200	2016200	Can it do Nintendogs justice?
2016200	2017200	Because, just, just.
2017200	2018920	It's a really different graphical style.
2018920	2019920	What's a kitty?
2019920	2022280	The graphical style is totally different from, like, a Nintendogs.
2022280	2023560	It's not realistic cats.
2023560	2025120	It's like cartoony alien cats.
2025120	2026120	Well, then never mind.
2026120	2028260	They have a video of it on iGn.
2028260	2029680	They have a video of it on other sites?
2029680	2031800	I usually avoid iGn, like, the plague, though.
2031800	2032800	You know.
2032800	2036240	Except, except I got Matthew Brando with blood.
2036240	2037240	They do have a lot of videos.
2037240	2041680	You know, there was a cats game that's already been out on the DS that you can do the exact
2041680	2042680	same thing.
2042680	2046480	It's called Cats with a Z at the end, you know, because they're extreme.
2046480	2047480	I don't know.
2047480	2048480	They do a dogs one, too.
2048480	2050320	Yeah, they have the dogs, horses, hamsters.
2050320	2057280	Wait, do these cats, like, go base jumping and, like, extreme snowboarding and stuff?
2057280	2058480	They're hardcore cats.
2058480	2064040	They do crystal meth and go to raves.
2064040	2066840	Wow.
2066840	2070240	They should have it, like, you know, they should have it where the cats actually start
2070240	2072520	scratching the DS, and you're like, what the fuck?
2072520	2075720	Why is there a throw up in my DS, you know, just stuff like that.
2075720	2080200	They should hack up hairballs and then poo on your, you know, your bathroom rug.
2080200	2084960	Of course, the chat room is all clamoring out in unison for Love Hamster, which was
2084960	2085960	a game we talked about.
2085960	2087820	Hamster does not have a P in it.
2087820	2091240	The Rob D says, you're just an intense pussy, Rob.
2091240	2096920	Anyway, speaking of crap, Codemasters' last Bubble Bobble game, Bubble Bobble Revolution,
2096920	2099600	was crap because you couldn't pass level 30.
2099600	2101120	What kind of a game is that?
2101120	2106680	Well, they're going back and recalling them so you can actually send it into Codemasters
2106680	2113080	and get a brand new copy that'll be fixed, and you can actually pass level 30.
2113080	2114280	That's good to know.
2114280	2118440	So if you happen to be unfortunate enough to have bought this game and haven't sold
2118440	2123840	it back yet, you may want to seek a better copy from Codemasters.
2123840	2128200	I think it would be great if there were only 31 levels, so they like send it in and it's
2128200	2133800	only one more level, and it's like, oh, okay.
2133800	2134800	Gotcha.
2134800	2135800	Wow.
2135800	2146440	Yeah, and that's the same, GS68 has the same thing in chat, but can you pass level 31?
2146440	2147440	Don't know.
2147440	2148440	What do you think, guys?
2148440	2154040	Now, do we ease up on the folks behind Bubble Bobble for the DS and not make any more level
2154040	2155040	30 jokes?
2155040	2156040	No.
2156040	2157760	You know what I think it really was?
2157760	2161800	I think they just didn't finish it on time, so they purposely made it so you couldn't
2161800	2165520	pass 30, and so that gave them more time to create more levels and stuff.
2165520	2168080	And they're like, yeah, now we've fixed it.
2168080	2170400	Yeah, now you can totally get past level 30.
2170400	2174760	I've read an interesting theory about that this is just a reflection of the general laziness
2174760	2179880	in QA and testing, because what the 360 and other next-gen systems have allowed you to
2179880	2184640	do with patching, because companies are too spoiled now with the whole patching thing.
2184640	2187040	If bugs are discovered, eh, they can go back and patch it.
2187040	2190920	But the problem is you can't really patch a DS game without doing a massive recall.
2190920	2194800	So I mean, is this maybe why this happened?
2194800	2195800	Possibly.
2195800	2201440	I mean, they obviously didn't play test it, because if, you know, oh, I can't pass level
2201440	2202440	30.
2202440	2203440	I just must suck.
2203440	2205880	I mean, other people would be better than I am.
2205880	2208600	All right.
2208600	2214040	Well moving on into other news, speaking of big letdowns, you might remember we even got
2214040	2215900	a call on this last week.
2215900	2219760	Somebody had said, hey, what do you think Konami's big announcement is?
2219760	2223860	Because remember we gave the rundown on Konami Gamer's Day last week, right, about the show
2223860	2225240	and all the games we played.
2225240	2229560	But Konami had put on their site, hey, boys and girls, stay tuned until Monday, because
2229560	2233180	we got some big shit, yo, that we're going to be laying down.
2233180	2234180	What was it?
2234180	2235180	I know what it is.
2235180	2236180	What?
2236180	2238000	They released a controller that you could play Frogger on.
2238000	2240040	No, that's actually old news.
2240040	2242000	I forgot to mention that during my gaming week.
2242000	2245120	I think that they released it, somebody had diarrhea when they went out.
2245120	2250080	Actually, I forgot to mention that Rice Princess and Casper the Gay and Xtaphir all got me
2250080	2252460	this little USB Frogger controller.
2252460	2255240	And all you have to do is plug it into the USB port and it installs the game and you
2255240	2256240	can play it.
2256240	2258520	And I'm here to tell you, the game sucks.
2258520	2259520	Balls.
2259520	2264720	Horrible, horrible, sloppy, wrinkly balls is what this game sucks.
2264720	2265720	It's horrid.
2265720	2266720	Ew.
2266720	2267720	That's gross.
2267720	2271800	And I spent more time staring at the now loading screen than I did actually playing the game.
2271800	2273560	Well, that's half the fun.
2273560	2275480	Was this like on clearance?
2275480	2276480	No.
2276480	2277480	Yeah, meaning yes.
2277480	2278480	Not.
2278480	2280480	How many dollars am I holding up?
2280480	2281480	Yes.
2281480	2283840	Was it seriously four bucks?
2283840	2284840	Wow.
2284840	2285840	It might be worth four bucks.
2285840	2288760	Not to make fun of Konami or anything, but I know.
2288760	2289760	Hey, look.
2289760	2293480	We gave glowing reviews of Gamers' Day last week, so I think I can say this shitty little
2293480	2295000	four dollar thing sucks, okay?
2295000	2296720	They're not going to cry.
2296720	2302880	Do you remember the first Gamers' Day we went to and even the second, like that summer thing,
2302880	2308480	that they had like a whole booth set up that they'd show you how to use the USB key thing?
2308480	2312840	I'm like, you fucking just plug it into a USB port.
2312840	2313840	How hard is that?
2313840	2316360	Uh, I can't get it in there right.
2316360	2317360	What the hell?
2317360	2320640	I mean, literally you just plug it in and it goes.
2320640	2324560	I mean, how do you fuck that up?
2324560	2326200	It's not supposed to go in my ass?
2326200	2327200	Damn it.
2327200	2330640	Alright, well anyway, so Konami, even though we've gotten way off track, Konami said they
2330640	2334200	were going to make this big announcement on Monday, and then here it was.
2334200	2335200	Here was the big announcement.
2335200	2337200	Here it is.
2337200	2341240	Last week, Konami announced new games in its Castlevania and DDR series.
2341240	2347440	It's going to be an incredible 2007, so stay tuned to these pages for the latest from Konami.
2347440	2349800	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
2349800	2354120	I mean, everybody was thinking, oh, it's going to be the Metal Gear Solid 4 information.
2354120	2355640	Oh, it's going to be Silent Hill Origins.
2355640	2356640	Oh, Silent Hill 5.
2356640	2360760	No, it was, hey, our big announcement is that we already made our announcement.
2360760	2361760	Sorry.
2361760	2362760	What?
2362760	2363760	That's it?
2363760	2364760	That was it.
2364760	2365760	Not even a reach around?
2365760	2366760	No.
2366760	2367760	Nothing.
2367760	2368760	I'm bitter.
2368760	2369760	Nothing.
2369760	2370760	No.
2370760	2374280	Any shitty, shitty, USB Frogger games for everybody.
2374280	2375280	Yay.
2375280	2376280	No.
2376280	2381760	If only Bar Man Act Zero were $4.
2381760	2386640	I'm tempted to wrap this up in toilet paper and give it away on the station to a lucky
2386640	2387640	listener.
2387640	2391280	Wait, is there going to be poop on that toilet paper?
2391280	2392280	No, maybe.
2392280	2393280	Ew.
2393280	2394280	But I don't want it.
2394280	2395280	No.
2395280	2396280	Maybe some Hershey's Kisses or something.
2396280	2397280	All right.
2397280	2398280	Anyway.
2398280	2399280	From your butt.
2399280	2400280	What is wrong with tonight's program?
2400280	2401280	I don't know.
2401280	2404320	Rice Princess and Eddie the Gay are here, but this program's off tonight.
2404320	2406520	Did you say Eddie the Gay?
2406520	2407520	Eddie the Gay.
2407520	2408520	Eddie Casper the Gay.
2408520	2413520	That's his full name, right?
2413520	2414520	I know I'm awesome.
2414520	2415520	All right.
2415520	2416520	Who's got the next story?
2416520	2417520	Is it me?
2417520	2418520	Your mom.
2418520	2419520	Oh, no.
2419520	2420520	Jamie, I believe it's you.
2420520	2421520	Is it?
2421520	2422520	Oh.
2422520	2423520	Yes.
2423520	2424520	I'm not your mom.
2424520	2428040	That would be wrong.
2428040	2432960	Looks like Activision has a hair up their ass because they're suing their own people.
2432960	2437080	Not really their own people, but they're suing people who worked on Guitar Hero now.
2437080	2443760	Remember that whole big stink they were having with the Ant Commandos for the unlicensed
2443760	2444760	guitar controller?
2444760	2453160	Well, they're suing them again and also including as defendants some folks that were with Red
2453160	2460160	Octane previously, that would be John Tam, Corey Fong.
2460160	2461880	Wasn't John Tam the dude that went to your house?
2461880	2462880	Yes, he is.
2462880	2463880	How funny.
2463880	2464880	He was pretty funny.
2464880	2465880	I mean, not funny.
2465880	2466880	I'm sorry, John.
2466880	2468880	It's not funny, but just interesting.
2468880	2469880	Sorry.
2469880	2470880	Small world.
2470880	2472720	I'll just sit down and shut up.
2472720	2479760	Well, also included is Corey Fong and Jamie Yang, who were...
2479760	2485160	They actually started another company since then that's working in conjunction with the
2485160	2486160	Ant Commandos.
2486160	2492640	So, in other words, these guys left Red Octane to go work with the Ant Commandos on a yet
2492640	2496720	unannounced game that probably has something to do with guitars?
2496720	2501920	Well, Activision is accusing them of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, misappropriating
2501920	2506720	trade secrets and confidential information, breach of contract, interference with constructional
2506720	2509880	relations and being stinky.
2509880	2513600	I'm glad they don't remember before 2005.
2513600	2520080	I mean, just, hmm, Guitar Freaks, ring a bell, anybody, no.
2520080	2524800	I even brought that up in a conversation, like, well, yeah, but we're different.
2524800	2525800	No, you're not.
2525800	2527800	To be fair, they are.
2527800	2529840	Okay, they have five buttons.
2529840	2531940	Guitar Hero, no, it's more than that.
2531940	2532940	You know it.
2532940	2537480	The game has a completely different look and feel than Guitar Freaks does, and it's crossed
2537480	2539040	over into popularity in a way.
2539040	2540040	I'm sorry.
2540040	2541040	I'm sorry, Bomani fans.
2541040	2542040	Guitar Freaks could never do.
2542040	2543040	Okay, fine.
2543040	2546760	If I put Keyboard Mania and made it look like Karaoke Revolution, oh, look, I got Keyboard
2546760	2547840	Hero.
2547840	2551080	That's all they fucking did is they changed the way the game looks.
2551080	2552360	Okay, great.
2552360	2555040	The notes come at me instead of straight up.
2555040	2557200	You know what other game did the exact same thing?
2557200	2558200	In the groove.
2558200	2564800	Is that different from you have a game like, I don't know, you have a platformer game like
2564800	2569860	Mario where he jumps and hits things, and then you have another game with a hero, like,
2569860	2573480	I don't know, The Legend of Kage where he jumps and hits things.
2573480	2574480	I don't know.
2574480	2575480	That's really obscure.
2575480	2576480	It's exactly the same.
2576480	2577480	That's exactly the same.
2577480	2578480	It's a move on.
2578480	2580480	So why isn't it a problem there?
2580480	2582760	Because they're stupid and they don't want to make a big fuss about it.
2582760	2583760	But here's the thing.
2583760	2584760	Here's where I have a problem.
2584760	2588920	I have a problem when you have the second person to come along and copy something and
2588920	2591320	say, oh, we're the originators of this stuff.
2591320	2592940	Bullshit, you were the originators.
2592940	2596720	You have no room to talk because this other company wants to make a guitar game.
2596720	2601840	That's just like when Street Fighter II was out there and then fighting games became popular.
2601840	2602840	You know what?
2602840	2606720	If say Mortal Kombat or whatever came down the line.
2606720	2607720	Mortal Kombat.
2607720	2608720	Thank you.
2608720	2609720	That's an excellent example.
2609720	2610720	What about King of Fighters?
2610720	2611720	What about World Heroes?
2611720	2612720	What about Art of Fighting?
2612720	2613720	What about Street Fighter?
2613720	2616760	Well, Art of Fighting, World Heroes and King of Fighters were all SNK so they could get
2616760	2617760	away with it.
2617760	2618760	That's fine.
2618760	2619760	Here's what I'm saying.
2619760	2620760	But they're all Street Fighter.
2620760	2621760	Here's what I'm saying, though.
2621760	2624040	Fatal Fury actually had multi-plane fighting, but sorry.
2624040	2625480	Okay, well, here's what I'm saying.
2625480	2629160	If the fucking originators of Fatal Fury came out and said, oh, we're pissed off that people
2629160	2631320	are copying our game, no, fuck them.
2631320	2633960	They were second in line or third in line.
2633960	2635380	They have no room to talk.
2635380	2639760	It's just like, you know, if the originators of In the Groove came out and said, oh, well,
2639760	2644720	we're pissed off that, you know, Dance Factory came out, well, fuck you, you copied someone
2644720	2645720	else.
2645720	2648040	The fighting games were actually around well before Street Fighter, but also, let's not
2648040	2652560	forget, though, remember the old houses for Obscure?
2652560	2657440	Pac-Man versus KC Crazy Chase for The Odyssey 2.
2657440	2663280	That game is now so hard to find because of being sued by Williams and Midway, but it's
2663280	2664280	the same thing.
2664280	2669660	Maze games have been around in a physical form before there were, remember the old mouse
2669660	2671520	trap games?
2671520	2674080	They existed beforehand.
2674080	2681280	I just think it's just a double standard right now that they really, well, the whole problem
2681280	2685920	is that Konami didn't do anything to, you know, protect their guitar freaks, you know,
2685920	2690020	patents or whatever they had there, so now they can't really, you know, stand on that.
2690020	2695440	But I still think it's retarded that they're suing over, you know, this game that, you
2695440	2698840	know what, Harmonix is working on something else right now and it's gonna blow this shit
2698840	2703720	away and then whatever, everyone's gonna get a big boner over that, so whatever.
2703720	2710680	Anywho, speaking of Guitar Hero, Activision is definitely showing their interest in Nintendo
2710680	2719080	platforms talking about doubling their, or aggressively targeting the Wii and DS for
2719080	2723880	titles such as, you know, the Spider-Man Shrek, etc., and talking about bringing Guitar Hero
2723880	2724880	to the Wii.
2724880	2729160	Although, what I've been reading, though, is it might not actually be Guitar Hero, might
2729160	2736680	be some other guitar game, but still, though, yeah, I guess you could do that, but the DS,
2736680	2740680	I don't know about that, that'd be kinda dumb, but we'll see.
2740680	2743680	Yeah, how exactly do you do Guitar Hero on the DS?
2743680	2745680	Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap, that's kinda dumb.
2745680	2746680	Yeah.
2746680	2747780	I don't know.
2747780	2751680	Maybe something would like you hold the chords with the stylus, I don't know, that's kinda
2751680	2755080	lame, but then that's why I don't design games, I guess.
2755080	2758160	Maybe I'll have a fun peripheral.
2758160	2762520	Anyhow, some other Konami music game related news, I should state, by the way, we were
2762520	2769840	the first website anywhere in the planet to run the official song list of DDR Universe
2769840	2774000	on the Xbox 360, the default song list is what it's gonna look like there.
2774000	2778120	Our very own staffer Mel B. did some work on that and found that, so if you wanna see
2778120	2780040	that, head on over to orangeontree.com.
2780040	2784920	Very interesting lineup, I gotta say, Cascada, every time we touch is in it, Rapper's Delight
2784920	2789320	by the Sugarhill Gang is in it, that's gotta be fun, and Kylie Minogue is in it as well,
2789320	2790320	so it's gonna be fun.
2790320	2793720	I hope it has an equally retarded video like it did in Pump It Up.
2793720	2795040	I don't know, we'll see.
2795040	2796040	That was hilarious.
2796040	2802440	Also, I wanted to say this regarding official Konami music games, there's an interesting
2802440	2806920	report on Bomani Style that was run earlier this week, we received our first confirmation
2806920	2812760	from Betzen that Beatmania 2DX Arcade will soon be testing in the next few weeks in Illinois
2812760	2815760	at Brunswick Zone in Naperville.
2815760	2822800	No version has been confirmed as of yet, although it is rumored to be Beatmania 2DX Gold.
2822800	2827960	What this is basically saying is that, possibly, Betzen could be distributing Beatmania 2DX
2827960	2829960	Gold here in the States.
2829960	2833020	Usually Beatmania 2DX machines have to be imported from other countries, which is why
2833020	2835180	you see them so, so rarely.
2835180	2840000	But very interesting that they would do this now, because Konami didn't announce a Beatmania
2840000	2843680	2 at their Gamers' Day, and they came out with Beatmania 1 last year, which makes me
2843680	2847320	think, I don't know if Beatmania 2 is coming out for the home.
2847320	2850880	So what would be the strategy of them trying to release one in the arcades?
2850880	2852360	I don't know.
2852360	2853360	What do you think, though?
2853360	2856880	Do you think they should release Beatmania 2DX over here in the arcades, or do you think
2856880	2857880	it's a lost cause?
2857880	2862340	Well, there's been places that have had it for years anyway.
2862340	2864200	But they're very niche places, you know?
2864200	2867960	Yeah, and the thing is, is that the majority of arcades are really going to be really lazy
2867960	2871040	and not want to upkeep that type of machine.
2871040	2874280	So if it's going to be around, it's only going to be at major places that are guaranteed
2874280	2875280	to be well-kept.
2875280	2879200	Other than that, they're going to be wasting however many thousand dollars a machine is
2879200	2882120	on something they don't want to keep up.
2882120	2885820	JV Mon says, get hype through the arcades, and then people would be like, hey, I want
2885820	2886820	to play that at home.
2886820	2891200	So maybe this is a way for them to re-light a fire under the Beatmania franchise at home.
2891200	2892200	I don't know.
2892200	2897320	I had heard the series didn't do that bad, but the fact that they didn't announce the
2897320	2899440	sequel kind of makes you worry.
2899440	2903440	Eh, not really, because I'm wondering if they just don't know what they're going to do with
2903440	2904440	platforms.
2904440	2910040	I mean, if you think about it, say they haven't started Beatmania 2 yet, where's the PlayStation
2910040	2912200	2 going to be, say, in November?
2912200	2913520	I mean, they don't know.
2913520	2916480	So it's kind of a risky thing to do.
2916480	2921000	That's why there weren't really any PlayStation 2 games announced at Gamers' Day.
2921000	2925120	Gaming Nerd says something interesting, 2DX barely gets any money in the U.S. to begin
2925120	2926120	with.
2926120	2927120	2DX Gold will be no different.
2927120	2932160	But what if they take the Beatmania 2DX machines out of the niche arcades that have them now,
2932160	2934720	you know, the arcades that are willing to import games, and they put them in your local
2934720	2935720	bowling alley?
2935720	2939080	You know, your local other arcade would stand to make more.
2939080	2941840	And plus, the machines are going to be cheaper if they're done here domestically.
2941840	2943760	They're going to be half as much, I think.
2943760	2944760	I don't know.
2944760	2945760	I'm just guessing.
2945760	2948600	But they might stand to make more in profit.
2948600	2949600	Just a thought.
2949600	2953920	Especially those machines, it's just that they have, you know, the giant plasma screen
2953920	2954920	on it and stuff.
2954920	2958400	I mean, granted, there are a lot of machines nowadays that have, you know, giant plasma
2958400	2959400	screens.
2959400	2964640	But, you know, I know with Golf Land, for example, we have little kids fucking breaking
2964640	2965640	that shit.
2965640	2971880	You know, replacing a plasma screen isn't cheap, and that's, you know, bad.
2971880	2975280	One can only hope, though, that if we're going to get it, it's going to at least be in good
2975280	2976280	shape.
2976280	2981720	I have a little bit of something that will be in good shape, because, well, it's brand
2981720	2982720	new.
2982720	2984800	So, we have our UK release dates.
2984800	2986800	How's that sound?
2986800	2987800	Yippee!
2987800	2993000	Coming out on the 16th is a bunch of stuff.
2993000	2999280	We have Armed Assault, or is it Arm A, I guess?
2999280	3004200	Arthur and the Invisibles, Cartoon Network Racing, Excite Truck, God Hand, Infernal,
3004200	3009720	Mario Hoops 3 on 3, Over the Hedge, Hammy Goes Nuts, Sherlock Holmes, The Awakened,
3009720	3015800	Supreme Commander, Toko Race Driver 3, and Tortuga, Two Treasures.
3015800	3017120	Great.
3017120	3018480	Wow.
3018480	3019720	Great.
3019720	3024120	Sorry, I seem kind of short.
3024120	3025120	Well, it's...
3025120	3027200	Yeah, I guess it's a slow month.
3027200	3030120	I'm looking at the Japanese release dates, they're not much longer, but...
3030120	3031120	Yeah.
3031120	3033040	I mean, the U.S., it's a pretty decent week, at least.
3033040	3037400	We're going to see some new stuff for the Wii with Wii Play, so if you're short a remote
3037400	3042520	and need to buy one for cheap, Wii Play is the way to go.
3042520	3046520	And then, of course, if you're not in, or don't have a Wii, on PlayStation 2, Ghost
3046520	3052320	Rider, which is kind of a rip-off of God of War, but, you know, God of War's not a bad
3052320	3053920	game, so definitely worth checking out.
3053920	3056320	It's also cheap, only $29.99.
3056320	3059560	I played Ghost Rider at E3, I don't know how much the game's changed, I mean, granted it's
3059560	3060560	been six months.
3060560	3063080	But that game sucked ass at E3, I'm sorry, it was horrid.
3063080	3064560	It looks a lot better now.
3064560	3068000	Well, that's encouraging, because maybe they took all the negative feedback from E3 and
3068000	3069000	did some retooling, so...
3069000	3070200	I think so, it looks pretty...
3070200	3073560	Alright, then I retract my statement, a game can change a lot in six months.
3073560	3078800	It looks very similar to God of War, like a very ripped-off God of War.
3078800	3085560	Anyways, the Warriors is coming out on PSP, and that's pretty inexpensive as well, only
3085560	3088320	$19.99, so definitely check it out.
3088320	3092880	Ratchet & Clank Size Matters on the PSP, if you're a Ratchet & Clank fan.
3092880	3098760	Galactic Civilizations 2, Dark Avatar, the expansion pack for that game is finally coming
3098760	3099760	out.
3099760	3103880	Test Drive Unlimited on PC, finally making its way to market.
3103880	3110560	Gurumen, A Monsterous Adventure on the PSP, brand new Atlus game.
3110560	3116280	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas on the PSP, lots of PSP love this week.
3116280	3122280	Monster Kingdom Jewel Summoner... what?
3122280	3123280	I'm sorry, I...
3123280	3124280	Stop making comments behind me!
3124280	3130120	No, we're not making comments at you, I've been, I'm flashing my chest at Irene.
3130120	3135160	Stop getting Irene excited, it's really, it's really distracting.
3135160	3136160	Anyways...
3136160	3138360	Thank God we're not a TV show.
3138360	3142360	Dream Lords on the PC, brand new MMO.
3142360	3147440	And then finally, a GameStop exclusive, Chulip, when I gotta tell you this game looks like
3147440	3148440	a...
3148440	3149440	Wait, it's a GameStop exclusive?
3149440	3152200	It's a GameStop exclusive, and it looks like a piece of doggy shit.
3152200	3158040	Wait, I played this game at E3 like two years ago when it was first, it was cute, I mean,
3158040	3161040	it isn't, is it $19.99?
3161040	3163160	Because that might be okay.
3163160	3167860	But yeah, I mean, it isn't gonna win any awards, but it was cute, I mean, you know what you're
3167860	3168860	getting into, okay?
3168860	3171360	It's a game called Chulip for Christ's sake.
3171360	3173520	Yeah.
3173520	3174520	It's a kissing simulator.
3174520	3175520	Yeah, it's a kissing game.
3175520	3176520	You go around, you kiss people.
3176520	3177520	Oh man, that's gonna...
3177520	3178520	What?
3178520	3180560	It's gonna, it's like a sexual harassment game.
3180560	3184160	It's gonna sell really well amongst the nerds, because they'll need practice kissing, because
3184160	3189920	they don't kiss anyone else, except for their moms.
3189920	3191920	That's so wrong.
3191920	3197720	No, um, no, Chulip is a $30 game.
3197720	3198720	What?
3198720	3199720	$29.99.
3199720	3200720	Thank God.
3200720	3203080	It'll be in the bargain bin in three weeks.
3203080	3204080	Come on.
3204080	3205080	You know it and I know it.
3205080	3206080	Come on.
3206080	3207720	Is that it?
3207720	3208720	That's it.
3208720	3212360	Japanese games coming out on February 15th on the PlayStation 2.
3212360	3215480	There's not a lot, actually, across the various systems.
3215480	3219480	Nothing on 360 or any of that stuff, but we have on PlayStation 2 Appleseed EX is coming
3219480	3221140	out from Sega.
3221140	3226640	They also are putting on Castlevania Curse of Darkness to Konami best hits.
3226640	3231880	I should also mention this game, Shining Force EXA is coming out.
3231880	3236560	Also Soul Cradle, Sekai o Kuro Mano is coming out.
3236560	3237560	I know.
3237560	3238560	Shut up, Irene.
3238560	3239560	I butchered every...
3239560	3242760	That's why they have me do the Japanese release dates, because I can't pronounce any of them.
3242760	3243760	That was awesome.
3243760	3244760	Shut up.
3244760	3245760	I hate you.
3245760	3246760	Sumimasen.
3246760	3252840	Zero no Suikaima is coming out as well from Marvelous Entertainment on the PlayStation
3252840	3253920	2.
3253920	3260120	Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Bleach DS 2nd is coming out, and this game sounds like it
3260120	3261120	might be fun.
3261120	3263120	Death Note, Kira Game.
3263120	3264120	Yes.
3264120	3265120	I want that.
3265120	3266120	It's coming out.
3266120	3267120	What the hell is Death Note?
3267120	3268120	I don't even know.
3268120	3269120	Death Note is awesome.
3269120	3270120	What is it?
3270120	3271120	It's awesome.
3271120	3272120	Okay.
3272120	3273120	Okay.
3273120	3274120	Thanks, Jamie.
3274120	3275120	They're really descriptive.
3275120	3276120	Hey, hey, hey.
3276120	3277120	I'm going to preorder that shit right now.
3277120	3278120	So, shut up.
3278120	3281680	Death Note is a manga done by the same one who did Hikaru no Go.
3281680	3284360	It's really, really, really, really, really, really, really cool.
3284360	3289520	They just did a movie, and they're working on a second movie, and the anime is out right
3289520	3291520	now.
3291520	3292920	It's super awesome.
3292920	3298600	It's about a guy who finds the notebook of a death god and then starts killing people.
3298600	3303040	And that's all I'm going to say, because everyone should be reading it.
3303040	3311120	And if that's not your cup of tea, Luminous 2 is coming out on the PSP in Japan.
3311120	3315160	I'm not sure what songs they got different than we did, but I know they have some other
3315160	3316280	songs there instead.
3316280	3319760	I think we read them on a previous episode, so you'll have to go back and look, because
3319760	3321160	I'm feeling too lazy.
3321160	3324920	But I do want to point out also on Sony PSP, Tales of Destiny 2.
3324920	3328000	If you're a Tales of Destiny fan, there you have it.
3328000	3329000	Oh, Rob.
3329000	3331160	Domo arigato for that news.
3331160	3332160	Shut up.
3332160	3339220	Well, actually, why don't you reserve your Domo arigato for Dark Sakura, because she
3339220	3344400	is going to give you her website of the week, and it's the place on the internet that you
3344400	3346280	should definitely be checking out right now.
3346280	3347280	It's not mine to give.
3347280	3348280	All right.
3348280	3350720	Well, we do.
3350720	3353920	It's the gift that keeps on giving here on Orange One's Radio.
3353920	3355240	Someone's sick and deranged website.
3355240	3356240	All right.
3356240	3358020	Well, you've found it, and you're highlighting it here for us.
3358020	3360840	So arigato, Dark Sakura.
3360840	3368320	Isn't that what Scott over on All Games calls you, Dark Sakura?
3368320	3372200	Dark, dark, ball Sakura.
3372200	3374440	Hearts, love you.
3374440	3377240	Are you done?
3377240	3378240	Yes.
3378240	3381960	And the site of the week.
3381960	3382960	Shut up, Rob.
3382960	3383960	Sorry.
3383960	3384960	I love that site.
3384960	3385960	Let me introduce this again.
3385960	3386960	I'm sorry.
3386960	3388280	Let me try this again here.
3388280	3389280	No, no, no, no.
3389280	3390280	Just fucking play the music.
3390280	3391280	I'm talking.
3391280	3392280	No, no, no, no.
3392280	3393280	Today's website of the week.
3393280	3394280	No, no, no.
3394280	3395280	Hold on.
3395280	3396280	No.
3396280	3397280	We're going to give this a proper...
3397280	3398280	Jamie's kicking Rob's ass.com.
3398280	3399280	All right.
3399280	3400280	I'm sorry for butchering your name.
3400280	3401280	So here we go.
3401280	3402280	We're going to give...
3402280	3403280	Here we go.
3403280	3404280	Ready?
3404280	3407280	It's time for Dark Sakura's hardcore website of the week.
3407280	3408280	Yeah.
3408280	3414280	We should do that from now on.
3414280	3421280	Today's website of the week is davidtennis.com.
3421280	3427280	Dude, I want to look up the extra music again.
3427280	3431280	As I said, today's website of the week is davidtennis.com because I couldn't think of
3431280	3432280	anything else.
3432280	3433280	Oh, never mind.
3433280	3434280	So much for the hardcore.
3434280	3435280	Meow, meow, meow.
3435280	3436280	Meow, meow, meow.
3436280	3439280	That would be david-tennis.com.
3439280	3445520	He is the man who plays the 10th doctor on Doctor Who and I love him.
3445520	3446520	That's all.
3446520	3450280	I think we should just change this feature to Doctor Who website of the week.
3450280	3451280	Yeah, the Doctor Who website of the week.
3451280	3454280	Hey, I haven't done a Doctor Who site in like three months.
3454280	3458280	I could bite my ass in a non-literal way.
3458280	3461280	Yes, Rice Princess has a question.
3461280	3462280	I do.
3462280	3463280	Can I help you?
3463280	3464280	Eddie wants to know.
3464280	3465280	Yes.
3465280	3466280	In any of the Lincoln...
3466280	3468280	Well, it was just, what, Ocarina of Time and...
3468280	3469280	No, no.
3469280	3473280	What ended up being the only village in the land of Hyrule in the Zelda games, Irene and
3473280	3476280	I pronounce it differently and we're going to start a debate.
3476280	3480280	I pronounce it Kakariko Village and Irene pronounces it...
3480280	3481280	Kakariko.
3481280	3482280	Maybe Kakariko.
3482280	3484280	And she's Asian so she's probably right.
3484280	3485280	Kakapupi.
3485280	3486280	Kakapupi Village.
3486280	3490280	All of us Whitey's back in the 90s called it Kakariko Village.
3490280	3495080	Yeah, but if you read the Kana in Japanese it has pretty much even pronunciation on every
3495080	3496800	syllable it would be Kakariko.
3496800	3498280	I didn't know the village had a name.
3498280	3499280	Are you serious?
3499280	3500280	Like the village...
3500280	3502280	That's exactly what I was going to say.
3502280	3506280	It's the village that has the chickens that you beat up that all attack you.
3506280	3508280	That's a really long title for it.
3508280	3509280	I mean, it is the village.
3509280	3510280	That's what Kakariko means.
3510280	3512280	It means town of chickens.
3512280	3513280	Town of chickens.
3513280	3516280	The town of avenging chickens.
3516280	3526480	Anyways, speaking of avenging chickens, we have a brand new program that's being started
3526480	3533280	by Microsoft and kind of teaming up with Old Spice Deodorant to...
3533280	3538280	No, I'm sorry, this is really funny because you know that stereotype.
3538280	3540280	Any other game would be uncivilized.
3540280	3546280	No, but you know like the gamer that's been sitting at home all day racking up these 10,000...
3546280	3547280	I'm sorry.
3547280	3548280	Finish your story.
3548280	3549280	I apologize for interrupting.
3549280	3550280	Any who.
3550280	3551280	Then I'll make my deodorant joke.
3551280	3558600	They're basically challenging Xbox Live users who are in America to add at least 1,500 achievement
3558600	3562640	points to their gamer score between February 12th and April 12th.
3562640	3567960	And depending on what your gamer score is now, starting off, that will depend on what
3567960	3569240	prize package you win.
3569240	3573880	And here are the different prize packages for you that you could possibly earn by wasting
3573880	3575680	this much time.
3575680	3585720	If your gamer score is 0 to 4,999, you can earn a game picture, a dashboard theme, and
3585720	3589920	Contra for Xbox Live Arcade.
3589920	3591220	That's level 1.
3591220	3598280	Level 2, which is between 5,000 and 9,999 gamer points, you receive everything from
3598280	3603680	the level 1 package as well as 100 Microsoft points and a contest t-shirt.
3603680	3605680	Oh my god!
3605680	3606680	That's awesome!
3606680	3607680	Dude!
3607680	3608680	Dude!
3608680	3609680	I love your shirt!
3609680	3610680	Dude!
3610680	3619180	Any who, if you have over 10,000 gamer points, you will earn the level 1 package, 200 Microsoft
3619180	3622960	points, a t-shirt, and Fusion Frenzy 2.
3622960	3623960	Oh my god!
3623960	3624960	A t-shirt!
3624960	3625960	Dude!
3625960	3626960	Dude!
3626960	3627960	Dude, I gotta get that t-shirt!
3627960	3628960	That game fucking sucks!
3628960	3631080	But I gotta get the t-shirt!
3631080	3635800	And by the way, we here at Orange Launch Radio are excited to announce that there's actually
3635800	3641000	some secret levels that have not yet been unveiled, but here's the deal.
3641000	3647140	If you have 20,000 gamer points or more, you're in level 4, and Old Spice will actually send
3647140	3653360	you free deodorant, because you probably need it if your gamerscore has gotten to be that
3653360	3654360	high.
3654360	3656360	Actually, I'm not gonna include it in every level, because all of this stinks, so...
3656360	3659680	They're like, no, no, no, we don't care about the prizes, we really just want to get the
3659680	3662360	deodorant to you and we're masking it with the prizes.
3662360	3668440	And if your gamerscore is 50,000 or above, you're on level 5, and Old Spice is going
3668440	3673920	to send you a free blow-up doll, because you probably need one of those as well.
3673920	3679520	But you know what, the best prize is in level 6, they actually send someone to punch you
3679520	3683760	in the gob.
3683760	3688760	QQ!
3688760	3696280	But if you, to enter this wonderful contest, just simply go to xbox.com slash rewards,
3696280	3703440	and you can enter after, well basically after the 12th, so hurry up and get those 1500 achievement
3703440	3708240	points so you can score that wonderful Fusion Frenzy 2, hooray!
3708240	3712320	Travis Donovan from our Saturday Night Program here at Orange Lounge says, worst product
3712320	3714760	tie-in promo ever.
3714760	3720080	Black Wolf from the other Sunday Night Program on the other network, allgames.com says, level
3720080	3725320	3 package equals 830 point value plus t-shirt plus Bill Gates' favorite game.
3725320	3729000	Oh my god, Fusion Frenzy 2 is Bill Gates' favorite game?
3729000	3730000	What a loser!
3730000	3732320	That's probably the only game he's played this year.
3732320	3737560	He's like, that's my favorite game.
3737560	3741280	Mystic Goan says, I'm so tired of hearing, wow, you play so much, your stink is going
3741280	3743280	through the mic.
3743280	3747320	Thanks, Old Spice!
3747320	3748800	QQ!
3748800	3753800	Anyhow, something else that is going to cause people to not leave the house for today, actually
3753800	3756920	I should ask real quick, are you going to participate in this, Loki?
3756920	3759340	Fuck no, Fusion Frenzy 2?
3759340	3762840	No, but you're not at that level, your gamer score is not 10,000.
3762840	3763840	T-shirt?
3763840	3764840	I know, free t-shirt.
3764840	3765840	Oh, t-shirt.
3765840	3766840	Something to work out.
3766840	3770720	I'm going to be doing Crackdown, so if I finish Crackdown that quick, I guess.
3770720	3773080	DDR Universe is going to be an easy 1,000 points.
3773080	3774080	DDR Universe, yeah.
3774080	3775080	All right.
3775080	3776080	Cookie Party.
3776080	3777080	Anyhow, what?
3777080	3778080	Cookie Party?
3778080	3779080	What?
3779080	3780080	Cookie Party.
3780080	3781080	You eat a Cookie Party t-shirt?
3781080	3784280	Fuck yeah, I would be renting, I'd be going to Blockbuster right now to rent like frickin'
3784280	3788440	NBA Live 06 or whatever those games are, I don't play, but I have the easiest gamer
3788440	3789440	scores in the world.
3789440	3792320	They give away a Cookie Party t-shirt, I'm all about that, and if you don't understand
3792320	3795320	the joke, that's too bad.
3795320	3798160	The Halo 3 beta invite.
3798160	3803240	Halo 3 beta invites the picture that are included with Crackdown, like the little slip that
3803240	3808400	comes in has been leaked out to the internet, and here's the catch about the Halo 3 beta,
3808400	3813540	you have to have the Crackdown disc to be able to play the Halo 3 beta, so no buying
3813540	3816640	the game, taking the slip out for the Halo 3 thing, and then selling the game back.
3816640	3822080	You actually have to hang onto the game, probably past the return window, to actually play the
3822080	3824160	Halo 3 beta online.
3824160	3831200	Just another thing too, the Halo 3 beta might not be available right as you pick up Crackdown.
3831200	3833520	I hope nobody's expecting that, it's not going to be.
3833520	3836920	I hope people don't think that's what's going to happen.
3836920	3840680	It just means that you're going to get into the beta whenever it's available.
3840680	3849040	Is that a subtle way for them to let people know that they're cracking down on that returning
3849040	3850040	thing?
3850040	3851960	Okay, I ruined that joke.
3851960	3853320	Say goodbye to Rice Princess, everyone.
3853320	3854320	It's the last show.
3854320	3855760	It's nice knowing you, Rice Princess.
3855760	3856760	Thanks for playing.
3856760	3857760	You lose.
3857760	3858760	Ball failed.
3858760	3864760	Well, in other gaming news, there is a particular little game that a lot of people were sort
3864760	3868520	of obsessed of that didn't go so well in Japan called Loco Roco.
3868520	3871920	Well, the sequel is now playable.
3871920	3882720	You can go actually onto the website and there is a downloadable version.
3882720	3883720	Did you download it?
3883720	3884720	Not yet.
3884720	3885720	Are you going to?
3885720	3886720	I haven't been home.
3886720	3887720	I see.
3887720	3888720	She got her hair did this weekend.
3888720	3889720	I got my hair did.
3889720	3890720	Yeah.
3890720	3896720	Now, there also is though a little bit of a rumor stating that it could be possible
3896720	3901680	this will be a PS3 version, but honestly, I'm really thinking that it should just stay
3901680	3908460	PSP because that type of game really lends itself well to the PSP, especially since you're
3908460	3914320	turning the six success is not going to be as much fun as the system itself or rocking
3914320	3915800	the system itself.
3915800	3921160	Yeah, I'm hoping it'll go on PSP as well because PSP, actually, PSP is having a little bit
3921160	3925920	of a resurgence with the Castlevania and some of these other games that are coming out.
3925920	3930200	It's importable ops and all these Konami's support behind PSP.
3930200	3934840	It's actually becoming more and more like a system people ought to be checking out,
3934840	3936040	especially if a price cut isn't.
3936040	3937040	I bought another PSP.
3937040	3938040	Did you?
3938040	3939040	Yeah.
3939040	3940040	Good job.
3940040	3941040	I bought it off of a friend.
3941040	3942040	What's this?
3942040	3943040	Your fourth?
3943040	3944040	Well, I only have two now.
3944040	3945040	Only?
3945040	3946040	Yeah.
3946040	3950960	Well, basically, this one is going to be... I'm going to put the Dark Alex firmware on there
3950960	3951960	now.
3951960	3958640	It's because my friend, he mistreats his PSP, so he broke the buttons and the analog sticks,
3958640	3961720	so I have to fix that, but I bought it for three bucks.
3961720	3966920	By the way, if you're listening to us on a PSP, you should visit OLRPSP.com.
3966920	3970120	Loki hasn't updated it in about a year, but it's still pretty, and there's a background
3970120	3971120	that you can download.
3971120	3972120	There will be new stuff eventually.
3972120	3973120	Sure, there will.
3973120	3974120	And I'm working on stuff.
3974120	3976360	Right after you finish the Wii website, too, right?
3976360	3979760	Actually, that has to do with the OLR PSP.
3979760	3980760	Oh, wheely.
3980760	3983760	Wow.
3983760	3984760	That's lame.
3984760	3985760	Anyways.
3985760	3988000	It's better than OPSP, really.
3988000	3992760	Some cool stuff, though, that you might be able to do in the future will include Skype,
3992760	4000760	because apparently, speaking of the new firmwares coming out, they have dissected the firmware,
4000760	4009400	and they have found a little line of code here in 311 that talks about the Skype plug-in,
4009400	4013960	so it's something that will be coming out possibly later on.
4013960	4015160	But that's kind of cool, though.
4015160	4020440	So Skype support coming soon to your PSP.
4020440	4021440	How is that going to work?
4021440	4022440	That's special.
4022440	4023960	Because there's no microphone on it.
4023960	4025640	Well, they have headsets for it.
4025640	4027280	You can use headsets for...
4027280	4029920	What ever happened to the DS thing that was like Skype?
4029920	4031800	Remember when they showed that at E3?
4031800	4034080	Like they had the white Wi-Fi voice thing?
4034080	4035080	Voice over IP?
4035080	4036080	Yeah.
4036080	4037640	Just like they have in Metroid Prime Hunter.
4037640	4039600	Oh, they put it in one game, Big Wow.
4039600	4043800	Actually, no, they have it in the new Diddy Kong Racing.
4043800	4045360	I think you're missing my point.
4045360	4050200	My point is, where is the standalone app where I can use this to call my friends across the
4050200	4051200	US for free?
4051200	4056520	Rob, now, if they had a standalone app, that would mean that they're embracing online.
4056520	4060840	They don't want to let everyone know that they're embracing online.
4060840	4061840	It's a secret.
4061840	4064940	Oh, because they haven't actually embraced online.
4064940	4068480	They're actually making the internet harder, is what Nintendo does.
4068480	4069480	You don't understand, Rob.
4069480	4070480	You don't understand.
4070480	4071480	Wii Connect 24.
4071480	4072480	It's connected all the time.
4072480	4076040	That means it's connected to something out there.
4076040	4077960	Something that makes my Wii glow.
4077960	4081520	But when I turn it on to see what that something is, there's nothing there.
4081520	4084960	But shortly after I turned it on, there's stuff there.
4084960	4088120	It's just it lets me know soon there will be more stuff there.
4088120	4091300	Wake me up when the Wii downloads my porn for me.
4091300	4092300	What the fuck is...
4092300	4095680	Honestly, and I hate to go on a rant about it again, but what the fuck is up with Wii
4095680	4096680	Connect 24?
4096680	4097680	It doesn't download my messages.
4097680	4099080	I don't have current weather.
4099080	4100600	I don't have current news.
4100600	4102480	It doesn't download any updates.
4102480	4104280	What the fuck is it doing?
4104280	4106120	Is your Wii on?
4106120	4108560	Yes, my Wii is on.
4108560	4112920	No, no, it's devil power making it glow.
4112920	4115200	You should be a Nintendo customer service rabbi.
4115200	4117920	Oh yeah, because I've had the total opposite experience.
4117920	4120760	My Wii starts glowing, I turn it on, and there's messages right there.
4120760	4123440	All the updates are downloaded without me having to do anything, so I don't know what
4123440	4124440	you're doing.
4124440	4125440	It's because you're like the biggest...
4125440	4129720	No, but don't you have to click in and actually do the update manually, right?
4129720	4130720	You still have to click the...
4130720	4132720	Yeah, I just had to do that.
4132720	4133720	What?
4133720	4134720	I've never had to do that.
4134720	4135720	Okay.
4135720	4138000	Do you have the news channel on your Wii right now?
4138000	4139000	I do.
4139000	4142220	Yeah, when there's a new server, because they're not just going to do that without you wanting
4142220	4143220	to do it.
4143220	4144360	But the messages are there.
4144360	4145960	The updates have like...
4145960	4148660	Yeah, it'll tell you right away.
4148660	4149660	That was the thing.
4149660	4152880	The thing about the 24s was to do all that shit without you having to think about it,
4152880	4153880	right?
4153880	4156600	Not the extra apps though, because you have to choose what apps you want.
4156600	4159080	Like I'd be kind of mad if I wanted, and I was like, I don't want that app, and it was
4159080	4160080	on there, you know?
4160080	4161760	But like the messages, I don't have to download them.
4161760	4164900	They're already there when I turn it on.
4164900	4170760	You do realize that those downloading apps that you so call, those are actually firmware
4170760	4171760	updates.
4171760	4175040	The apps were meant to be on the system, and all you're doing is updating the firmware.
4175040	4179740	So yes, you are having to download the updates it's not doing for you automatically.
4179740	4182760	It's not downloading the programs, say like the internet browser, that you actually had
4182760	4183760	to download.
4183760	4184760	Yeah!
4184760	4186480	But what if you don't want the internet browser?
4186480	4187480	Too bad!
4187480	4188480	Then don't download it!
4188480	4189480	Oh, why?
4189480	4192420	The internet browser you don't have to download, it's news and weather.
4192420	4193920	You need your news and weather.
4193920	4197360	Oh yeah, I really need that really bad.
4197360	4201000	I would like to take a quick poll of all the Wii owners in the room.
4201000	4206120	How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?
4206120	4208160	How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?
4208160	4209360	I will go first.
4209360	4214140	I've used the forecast channel twice, and the news channel three times.
4214140	4217920	And once was this week because I was looking for pictures of Anna Nicole Smith.
4217920	4219000	Loki.
4219000	4223120	I used the forecast channel once today, but it had weather from midnight, which said it
4223120	4228800	was still raining, yet outside it's blurring sun, so apparently that was wrong.
4228800	4233360	And Loki went outside in a huge park going, man, fuck the Wii!
4233360	4236240	I just wanted to know if it was raining later, but I'd have to go in and...
4236240	4239920	How about you open a window, dumbass, that's going to tell you if it's raining or not.
4239920	4244600	Well, I know if it's raining now, I want to know if it's raining later, hence the forecast.
4244600	4248240	I don't want to know what it's doing now, I mean, because I can just look out a window.
4248240	4249680	We can open it now, Kat.
4249680	4250680	Exactly.
4250680	4253800	I don't want to know what weather it was at midnight, oh great, it was raining while I
4253800	4254800	was asleep.
4254800	4255800	Excellent!
4255800	4256800	That's great to know!
4256800	4260360	In case I was outside when I was sleeping!
4260360	4261360	So it...
4261360	4262360	That's stupid.
4262360	4265040	Well, the Sleepwalkers of America, thank you, you insensitive fuck.
4265040	4268440	Well, they would know after the fact, they'd be like, what the fuck?
4268440	4269440	It's raining!
4269440	4272760	They're like, oh man, I have pneumonia, this sucks.
4272760	4277120	DarkSakura, how many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?
4277120	4279000	She's holding up a big fat zero.
4279000	4280000	Eddie?
4280000	4282760	Just one time when I first got it.
4282760	4285200	Dan just used it, though.
4285200	4286240	Like every day?
4286240	4289400	I just happened to be in the living room and he had it up while I was sleeping.
4289400	4290400	Okay, so once.
4290400	4293000	More than that, but I just thought once.
4293000	4297080	I haven't used either before, but I use the foreskin channel a lot.
4297080	4298480	It's my favorite one.
4298480	4300880	Why are you on the... who invited you on tonight's program?
4300880	4301880	Nobody did, did they?
4301880	4302880	Me?
4302880	4303880	That's what I thought.
4303880	4304880	I invited myself.
4304880	4305880	I remembered why you haven't been on this program in a while.
4305880	4310000	Anyway, moving on to other news.
4310000	4317680	News coming out of DICE, the DICE show, D-I-C-E, coming out of Las Vegas, the PSP and the PS3
4317680	4320200	networks will be joining together.
4320200	4324120	That was coming from Phil Harrison, quote, this year we'll be adding some functionality
4324120	4327200	to the PSP that will unify our approach.
4327200	4330520	So we really don't know what exactly that means yet.
4330520	4335360	That means I don't have to buy a PlayStation 3 to download PlayStation 1 games to my PSP.
4335360	4339440	If maybe that means that they'll have the same look and feel of the store or what's
4339440	4341520	going on, but we don't really know.
4341520	4347480	That means that the PlayStation Portable will actually have a network store, since it doesn't
4347480	4348480	right now.
4348480	4352560	That'll be kind of nice, because the Sony website isn't even that great on the PSP.
4352560	4353560	I don't know if you've gotten to it.
4353560	4354560	It's not that great.
4354560	4362960	I try not to go to it, because it's lame.
4362960	4366480	I'm reading comments in chatroom, by the way, who's given some feedback on the whole debate
4366480	4367800	we were having in here.
4367800	4371160	James Patrick says, forecast is good here in Texas, it told me it was going to rain
4371160	4373160	a couple of times.
4373160	4374160	Interesting.
4374160	4378400	Burshad says, wait, we are gamers, we are in the basement, no windows.
4378400	4379640	Oh, I forgot.
4379640	4380640	Sorry about that.
4380640	4381640	How could I forget?
4381640	4384040	Oh, yeah, because we're on the second story.
4384040	4385040	Anyhow.
4385040	4396520	Well, I actually read an article last week about an HMV UK retailer who was doing a PSP
4396520	4397760	PS3 bundle.
4397760	4404720	They have retracted it now due to consumer pissed-offness.
4404720	4405720	They've heard the people.
4405720	4406720	Is that the legal term?
4406720	4408220	Yes, pissed-offness.
4408220	4413360	They have heard the people, they have gone back and said that for anyone who's participated
4413360	4419480	in the pre-order, they will give them an option of just ordering the PS3 or get the bundle.
4419480	4428560	The PS3 is going to cost £425 on the March 23 release in Europe with 220,000 units to
4428560	4430760	be available on that day.
4430760	4437240	But, yeah, if you're going through HMV, you can just order just the PS3 now, although
4437240	4438240	I don't know why.
4438240	4441720	There's only one good game on it.
4441720	4444240	So they did this in response to customer demand?
4444240	4445240	Pretty much.
4445240	4446920	So the tribe has spoken?
4446920	4449160	The PMS of the masses have spoken.
4449160	4450160	I see.
4450160	4451160	All right.
4451160	4455220	Well, there's some other news that came out of DICE this week as well, featuring some
4455220	4461440	wonderful announcements of stuff, including the PlayStation Ducks are back and their own
4461440	4467200	game now called Super Rub-a-Dub, and apparently the game looks very similar to the arcade
4467200	4469920	game Bubbles, which is kind of interesting.
4469920	4476960	You tilt the screen around, moving the mother duck to collect the baby ducks and reach the
4476960	4477960	end.
4477960	4484000	Yeah, that will be coming sometime soon, I guess.
4484000	4490720	And then, of course, they were talking about SingStar for the PlayStation 3 and how the
4490720	4495560	PlayStation Store will be supporting that as well.
4495560	4498280	So that's not a big surprise.
4498280	4502560	And of course, also talking about how people will be able to create their own custom user
4502560	4507040	pages, including video performances of them singing.
4507040	4513680	I assume that you would need the eye toy for this, or the EYE OF JUDGEMENT, or whatever.
4513680	4516880	And then, of course, they were talking about- Will Simon Cowell be a part of the Eye of
4516880	4517880	Judgment?
4517880	4518880	I thought it was awful.
4518880	4520240	No, they will not.
4520240	4523560	I think you should take a gun and shoot yourself in the face.
4523560	4528240	And then finally, the PlayStation 3 online platform will continue to evolve aggressively.
4528240	4532920	Well, that's great, because one game, or less than one game a month, kind of sucks
4532920	4535880	right now with your PlayStation online store.
4535880	4540000	I know people bitch about no updates to the Xbox 360s market, but jeez.
4540000	4545440	Yeah, at least Xbox 360s gains stuff on a weekly basis, at least.
4545440	4550160	I have yet to see some new demos come to the PlayStation 3 store.
4550160	4552240	But it's early for PlayStation.
4552240	4554160	Xbox was slow in the beginning as well.
4554160	4557800	Yeah, I remember that, but still though, come on.
4557800	4560840	I don't want to see an update- Oh, there's new stuff on the PlayStation Store!
4560840	4565200	It's a new PS1 game that you can't play on the PS3, you need to play it on your PSP.
4565200	4566200	Well, fuck you.
4566200	4569480	Raven's Dolphin says, Loki, I think the duck is a joke I do not know.
4569480	4571040	What's the duck joke?
4571040	4576280	The duck they showed at every new console launch, it's like the tech demo that they
4576280	4577280	had.
4577280	4583880	Oh, the way they build a tub with the rubber ducks to do how many on-screen polygons.
4583880	4590400	That was on the very first disc, the PS position demo disc.
4590400	4593840	Well speaking of PlayStation, at least the portable types, they're going to get you in
4593840	4595800	trouble in New York City pretty soon.
4595800	4599200	But don't worry, Sony fanboys, Nintendo DS is a fair game as well.
4599200	4604640	This is the reason, three pedestrians have been killed in Brooklyn since September because
4604640	4610200	they step into the road while using an electronic device and it distracts them from people yelling,
4610200	4611200	watch out!
4611200	4613320	You know, hey, get out of the way, there's a car coming.
4613320	4618020	And what they're thinking about doing now is that they're going to pass a law that says,
4618020	4622160	it's legislation, it hasn't been passed yet, but it's on the table, about you could be
4622160	4628240	charged a $100 fine if you're using a PSP, a Nintendo DS, an iPod, a Blackberry, or a
4628240	4630960	mobile phone, all while crossing the road.
4630960	4636880	So I think it's dangerous to use a device and walk.
4636880	4638120	What about people driving?
4638120	4641080	Oh, it's dangerous too, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4641080	4643160	Well, she is illegal there too, isn't it?
4643160	4646080	But well, yeah, I mean, that's already illegal in New York City, but you have to remember
4646080	4647080	the very...
4647080	4648080	It's illegal here too, Rob.
4648080	4652200	Well, not yet, but it almost is, but keep this in mind is that...
4652200	4653600	I switched to speakerphone anyway.
4653600	4655800	Back off, lady.
4655800	4659700	The thing you have to remember too, in New York City, hello, it's unlike any other city
4659700	4660700	when you're talking about pedestrians.
4660700	4663280	I mean, there's so freaking many pedestrians.
4663280	4666440	So it really is kind of its own unique little world.
4666440	4667440	You know what?
4667440	4668440	They make the laws for a reason.
4668440	4671400	They're trying to protect people, not inhibit what they're doing.
4671400	4675680	Apparently it takes a few retarded people stepping out in the traffic, jaywalking while
4675680	4678600	talking on their cell phone or playing a fucking game.
4678600	4682000	Who would the fucking play a game and walk in the first place is what I want to know,
4682000	4683000	but whatever.
4683000	4684000	So they're doing it.
4684000	4688320	Some of our New York City living friends chime in on this in the chat.
4688320	4691580	Rama says, Sky, some people are too stupid to pay attention.
4691580	4695520	You do not turn the volume up to the point where you cannot hear a honking horn.
4695520	4699040	Legend of Zaku says, looks like this guy hasn't heard about natural selection.
4699040	4701040	Amen to that.
4701040	4703080	What do you guys think about this law?
4703080	4706760	Is this a needed law, a necessity?
4706760	4713000	I think that Darwinism should just be let work because that would cleanse the gene pool.
4713000	4714000	Wow.
4714000	4716180	All right.
4716180	4719440	I think we have to blame Grand Theft Auto for this because in Grand Theft Auto you run
4719440	4720440	over people.
4720440	4723960	So therefore Grand Theft Auto is to blame because these people are getting run over
4723960	4725000	by cars.
4725000	4726480	It makes perfect sense.
4726480	4729240	Where is the justice with these damn M-rated games?
4729240	4733740	We need to take them off the shelves because clearly it's not incompetent people that are
4733740	4735240	causing deaths.
4735240	4738240	It is these M-rated games.
4738240	4743960	How do they know that the drivers aren't playing their PSPs while they're driving?
4743960	4745200	Like maybe it's their fault.
4745200	4747560	Maybe the driver is playing driver.
4747560	4751720	Yeah, and then a car just falls right in front of them out of the sky.
4751720	4753840	I just got punched in the face by a gay man.
4753840	4758080	I think it's kind of a silly piece of legislation right there.
4758080	4759080	But that's just me.
4759080	4760080	I live in New York.
4760080	4761080	I don't know.
4761080	4765200	But seriously, I think that if you're stupid enough to not pay attention when you're crossing
4765200	4768880	the road, you pretty much have it coming.
4768880	4774440	I think it's one thing, if it was like a little kid who wasn't old enough to have the common
4774440	4775440	sense.
4775440	4777280	Well, the parents should be there to tell them to look out.
4777280	4778280	Exactly.
4778280	4780640	Well, okay, but if they're walking home from school, but then again the parents should
4780640	4781960	still tell them in advance.
4781960	4788480	They should teach them to look both ways before crossing the street, cross walks, and freaking
4788480	4791920	pay attention because people are stupid.
4791920	4795080	The drivers aren't going to pay any more attention than they are.
4795080	4799080	If I'm crossing the road, hell yeah, I'm going to look and make sure that nobody's coming
4799080	4800080	for me.
4800080	4806640	I think that if you think that your video game is more important than your life, by
4806640	4812360	all means play your game and spare the rest of us your DNA.
4812360	4817640	I was thinking they shouldn't pass that so that people can still be getting hit by cars
4817640	4820560	while they're doing that, and then I can just run over and take their PSP while they're
4820560	4824000	on the ground, dying, and I'm like, yes, I have a PSP now.
4824000	4825000	Oh, you're so sympathetic.
4825000	4826000	I know.
4826000	4827000	I would totally do that.
4827000	4828000	Yeah, me too.
4828000	4829000	It's like you're stupid.
4829000	4830000	You don't deserve one of these.
4830000	4835480	Well, I sense the angst rising in this room, and you know what happens when the angst rises?
4835480	4837480	People die.
4837480	4849360	It's time for the FUs of the week here, boys and girls.
4849360	4851360	I love the FUs of the week.
4851360	4854040	Dark soccer, then start us off.
4854040	4861760	A big FU to the medical industry for being more interested in selling us drugs than actually
4861760	4871760	fixing the problem, because they give you all these drugs that do nothing but treat
4871760	4878240	the symptoms or suppress the symptoms that your body creates to help you heal, and making
4878240	4883720	us more and more and more and more dependent on them, when I think it's one thing that
4883720	4888920	if you say have diabetes and need insulin, that's one thing.
4888920	4898080	That's chronic condition, but if you have the flu and think, oh my God, I need to take
4898080	4901720	this drug and this drug and this drug and this drug, when all you have to do is drink
4901720	4907440	some tea, take some vitamin C, and take some time off work and sleep, you don't need to
4907440	4913580	pay the whole reason that the medical field is so fucked up right now, because people
4913580	4917040	are too dependent on treating symptoms.
4917040	4923640	I've learned so much since going into massage therapy about how the body works.
4923640	4928200	And also, if you're stressed out, take some fucking time and breathe.
4928200	4932120	You're dumping adrenaline and other toxins into your liver, you are making yourself fucking
4932120	4934840	sick, just stop and breathe.
4934840	4936360	I'm done.
4936360	4937840	Low key.
4937840	4943560	Shut up, Fireballa, fuck you, and it'll give happy endings.
4943560	4947120	If you want to join our chat room, you too can get yelled at by Dr. Stalker.
4947120	4954500	I'd like to make an epi to the highway patrol in California, because I saw them speeding
4954500	4958960	and not changing lanes using their blinker.
4958960	4963080	One of them did that, so props to him, but the other fucking guy, what kind of example
4963080	4965040	are you setting for these other drivers out there?
4965040	4968680	No wonder they're driving like assholes, because you drive like an asshole too, and they think
4968680	4973000	it's okay because the lawman's driving, you know, I don't give a shit if you can do that,
4973000	4974000	whatever.
4974000	4979480	So fuck that, and yeah, that's all I got.
4979480	4980960	I'm not very angry today.
4980960	4988880	Oh, yeah, fuck Activision for, you know, suing people over Guitar Hero, the completely original
4988880	4991920	guitar game out there.
4991920	4997240	My FU of the week goes to my doctor for not being available when I meet her, and to the
4997240	5001680	dentist for my temporary crown falling out a second time.
5001680	5003960	That's just lovely.
5003960	5004960	Rice Princess, do you have any FUs?
5004960	5005960	Any angst you'd like to get off your chest?
5005960	5006960	Yeah, I wanted to say FUs, too, because you're playing this version of One Night Angel, and
5006960	5007960	you should be playing the piano version.
5007960	5008960	Hello?
5008960	5009960	Jamie's Choice, not mine.
5009960	5010960	Oh, okay.
5010960	5011960	Well, you can play that one.
5011960	5012960	This is more hardcore.
5012960	5020600	Yeah, so it would be in honor of Eddie and I. I remember that one from our show.
5020600	5021600	I do.
5021600	5022600	And nobody else does.
5022600	5023600	Yeah, that's okay.
5023600	5024600	Rice Princess.
5024600	5026600	Well, then we can refresh their memories by reenacting it on their own.
5026600	5028600	I think I deleted that in P3.
5028600	5030920	I think I'm gonna punch you.
5030920	5033960	Eddie, any FUs of the week you want to give?
5033960	5042120	Yeah, I'm FUing whiny, immature, straight girls to steal, like, eyes from me, so, huh.
5042120	5043120	Me too.
5043120	5044120	Well.
5044120	5045720	Stupid straight girl.
5045720	5046720	Look out.
5046720	5051400	That was a good comeback.
5051400	5052960	Look out.
5052960	5056560	You need a third eye for that one.
5056560	5057560	Nobody understands that.
5057560	5058560	I know.
5058560	5060560	I know, because no one listens to The Wednesday Show.
5060560	5064240	Anyhow, I think now's a very good time to take a break.
5064240	5067080	I don't know about you kids, but I think now's a good break time.
5067080	5068320	So we're gonna take a break right now.
5068320	5072600	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
