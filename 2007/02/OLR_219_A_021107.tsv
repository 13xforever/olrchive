14213	26108	Tonight, February 11th, 2007, Xbox Gamerscore whores might get rewarded soon, an old DC gaming franchise is said to be coming back, and we have some exclusive news on the Alice movie.
32011	33591	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
33631	36232	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36292	42393	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video gaming and gaming culture and what you, the gamer, really want to know.
42894	43974	And I'm here to help you through that.
44014	44874	My name is Rob Roberts.
44894	45754	You might know me as Sky.
46094	48215	Joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-hosts.
48255	51716	In that corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52016	52316	Roar.
52596	53376	Fresh off the highway.
53868	55189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
75048	81893	First off, I want to apologize for my sound tonight because A, I'm recovering from a cold, so I sound a little bit congested.
81933	90139	I got the plague, so I guess in 2007 this will be the year of Rob getting the plague instead of Jamie getting the plague all the time, so that's entertaining.
90786	91387	Urgent care.
119378	120318	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
145202	151186	That sounds like I'm talking out of a tin can, even though this microphone probably costs twice as much as Loki's microphone that he's using.
151306	153248	Which the top is falling off of this microphone.
153328	154308	Oh, that's just lovely to hear.
154328	156230	Well, then you'll have a tin can microphone soon, too.
156250	157671	My microphone's working just fine.
157831	160092	I want that, but that was donated to us.
160113	161834	I have no idea where that microphone came from.
162574	163415	I know who it came from.
163735	166757	I know where it came from, but I mean, I know who donated it.
166777	167318	I know where to get them.
167698	167998	Really?
168198	169359	Because we need two more like that.
169419	170019	Guitar Center.
170380	170600	Really?
171180	171921	Then that's where we're going.
171941	172381	We're going shopping.
172401	173842	Any place that sells microphones.
174102	174923	We're going shopping.
175848	177689	No, dude, I got this at Radio Shack.
177709	180090	I was like, oh, Radio Shack, you know, they have like 10 different microphones.
180130	181170	I mean, radio crap.
181410	187672	Well, I mean, this microphone, I don't want to tell you how much it was, but I'll say it was twice as much as that one, and it has the tin can sound to it.
188692	189613	So, I don't know.
189853	191093	I think it just takes some getting used to.
191113	193214	Just put it up to your neck and go, hello.
195475	195755	Oh, really?
195815	196075	Okay.
196615	200056	I was being told secrets from Jamie, so maybe we will get a shopping spree next week.
200096	200336	Who knows?
200617	201837	Wait, are you saying I should do this, Loki?
202287	202647	Eddie,
232037	232920	Yep, that's me.
232940	234544	Eddie, have you ever been on this show before, Eddie?
234585	235948	Yeah, like three or four years ago.
236189	237433	Big, fruity, gay Eddie.
237633	239037	Casper the gay, that's me.
239057	239599	Casper the gay.
240925	244226	Eddie the Friendly Gay, what kind of games are you into since you've never been on the show before?
244246	245126	Never been on the show before.
245586	247466	Or at least, you haven't been on here since we've been podcasting.
247646	250887	Like when you were on the show, we had like five people listening and we thought we were the shit.
251227	252347	Including us in the room.
252808	255588	Exactly, it was like the live studio audience was it.
255688	256508	We were live performers.
256528	259529	But now we have this whole like internet podcast, iPod thing, it's crazy.
259609	260729	Alright, so what type of games are you into?
260749	267551	Fantasy Adventure, yeah, I'm a diehard Nintendo fanboy, which everybody, I guess is not as bad anymore because Wii's pretty cool, but yep.
268031	269451	Fantasy Adventure, kind of games like Zelda.
271037	271537	RPGs.
272018	274700	Was Zelda like your favorite game that came out last year, you'd say?
274840	276181	Yeah, Twilight Princess by far.
276221	278143	What would you say is your favorite video game of all time?
278263	279364	Just so we have something to go off of here.
279985	280445	Of all time?
280986	282647	Probably like Link to the Past, something like that.
282707	284729	So you're a total Link fanboy.
284809	285129	Nerd.
285810	286290	Nerd.
286471	287131	Nerdy nerd.
287592	287932	All right.
288693	291916	Well, Casper the Gay, do you follow gaming news a lot?
291956	293217	Do you follow the gaming culture?
293257	295178	Yeah, I log on to the IGN sometimes.
295319	295559	Really?
295579	295659	Yeah.
296055	298135	You shouldn't log on to those big money sites, though.
298156	298836	Yeah, I know, I know.
298936	303957	The correct answer is, I read independent blogs like Destructoid and Kotaku.
304517	304937	There you go.
304957	305937	Whatever Rob said.
308278	311759	And I'll go to Orange Lounge Radio for all my news and awgames.com.
311779	312439	They're the shit.
312699	313099	There you go.
313479	313999	Good job, Eddie.
314079	314459	Yeah, good.
314939	315860	That's what I sound like.
315940	316200	All right.
316860	317280	Also, no.
317360	320381	Actually, you know, as far as the big box... Why is Eddie Mr. Bill?
320461	320801	I don't know.
320821	321081	As far as...
322299	325882	As far as the big box sites go, IGN doesn't bug me nearly as bad as some of the others.
325982	326963	Yeah.
328464	329585	Anyway, let's see.
329605	334489	I'm reading chat room because we also have the chat room is always here to lend their perspective as well.
334509	335290	We love our chat room.
336151	336491	Let's see.
336511	337192	What do we have here?
337512	339173	JV Mon says, Yay, Rice Princess.
340114	342596	Dark Knight says, What is up, our home girl?
343497	345058	You can't even say it right, Ron.
345779	346840	I'm doing very good.
346900	347680	How about you?
348321	348521	Good.
348982	349342	Let's see.
350055	352175	Actdeft says, isn't every gay person friendly?
352896	353156	No.
353636	353896	No.
354696	357256	I've dated some real bitches in the past.
357416	358156	No, no, no, no.
358717	359617	No, no, no, no, no.
359977	362677	In fact, we could name some on this program, but we're above that.
363517	363957	I'm not.
364138	364438	All of you.
364458	365998	No, I'm just kidding.
366098	371659	All I'm going to say, if you like to listen to the live shows on Orange Lingerie, because, you know, we don't just do this podcast.
371679	372779	We have live shows there as well.
374019	377960	Wednesday happens to be Guys on the Show, and it's our Valentine's Day special.
379181	381222	We're going to be calling some of our exes on air.
381803	382123	Yes!
383424	385885	And wishing them a happy Valentine's Day, so that'll be a good time.
386426	389088	Anyway, let's see.
390989	393330	JV Mon says, I am gay and I am far from friendly.
393591	394751	You know, I met JV Mon in person.
394771	395352	He was just shy.
395412	396012	He was a little quiet.
396653	397333	I think he's gay.
398254	398534	Yes.
399079	400060	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
429336	429796	TV?
430096	430717	Yeah, I know.
430817	432257	I know you don't watch, so that's why I'm sharing this with you.
432277	433498	I don't even have cable, Rob.
433518	434698	Okay, but okay.
434718	436379	The extent of my cable is Court TV.
436419	438699	Are you familiar with Lifetime, Vagina Television?
438899	439740	Are you familiar with Lifetime?
439800	440060	Yes.
440100	440460	Television?
440520	443061	I haven't watched Lifetime in easily three years.
443921	444061	Right.
444361	448243	Well, Lifetime is like women's TV and like, you know, all the... That's why I don't watch it.
448303	448743	It's stupid.
448803	451424	The movies they have on there are like the best movies ever.
451484	452124	They have like, you know...
452645	458228	Final Justice, the story of the woman who stood in line at Walmart for a PS3.
458268	464271	The story of the woman who was horribly raped and murdered and had a Lifetime movie made out of her.
464291	464872	And had ear mites.
465012	466853	Right, I freaking love Lifetime movies.
466933	468394	Or the most recent one.
468414	470195	I should pick up a Lifetime movie.
470275	471475	You should be a Lifetime movie.
471575	471976	No way.
472016	474737	Dark Sakura, the gamer girl of the millennia.
474797	475057	I don't know.
476918	479260	The Fantasia Barino story was one I just recently watched.
479280	481441	But anyway, my point is, there's commercials...
482042	485483	for this new show they're doing, Gay, Straight, or Taken.
485543	493525	It's a dating show, and the thing is that a woman goes out on a date with a gay man, a straight man, and a guy who's already married or taken, has a girlfriend.
494106	496987	And at the end is when she finds it.
497027	504629	She has to pick which one's which, and if she correctly picks the straight man, then they win a fabulous date prize, like Hawaii type thing.
504909	508170	But if she picks one of the others, then they win a prize, and she gets nothing.
509315	511602	Yeah, because whiny straight girls have it so hard.
511943	512445	What?
513729	515053	So is this something you would watch?
515073	515133	No.
517348	517968	Hell no!
518509	521910	Is this a video game that would appeal to gamer girls?
523091	527813	Because you know there's always that thing going around like, how do we get women into gaming?
528653	530734	I've got two women in here.
530774	532035	How do we get women into gaming?
532055	537597	Do we need lifetime to bring out the video voyeur, the Susan Wilson video game?
537657	539338	Is that what we need?
539718	544820	I'm having a terrible hair day.
544980	546401	Video games need more violence.
546963	548144	is that how to get women into gaming?
548164	563880	I like to see more titties in games definitely wait a minute we need boobs and blood more guy on guy spanking wait, wait, wait I'm done with that it's all about Dead or Alive Extreme and Rumble Roses
571167	572767	and Rule of Roses Candy.
573428	577688	It's all about sequels to the Desperate Housewives PC game.
578389	583730	Because if there's a skill that's vastly needed in this world, it's cooking and cleaning.
583930	585530	Alright, going to the chat room for some comments.
585590	590271	Jared J says, Rob, you just crossed from respectable gay to stereotypical uber gay.
590671	592591	Whatever, girlfriend, whatever.
592631	593332	You don't know me.
593432	594092	Sit down.
594512	595392	Oh, snap, girl.
596152	597813	That is so not me.
598053	598793	That is so not me.
598833	599233	I'm sorry.
599253	600013	It's really not...
600734	601935	That's so not you when you're sober.
603496	604257	Yeah, when I'm drunk, maybe.
605058	605378	Let's see.
605418	607480	Gaming Nerd says, my parents watched it one day.
607500	608321	It was pretty creepy.
609282	611364	JV Mon says, I hate gay straight or taken.
612345	612745	Let's see.
613846	616028	Padrino says, what if the taken guy is gay?
616168	616589	I don't know.
617304	619006	I don't know, what if the taken guy is gay?
619026	621228	Yeah, there was the gay guy that was taken on the show before.
621248	623170	It's always a straight guy that's taken.
623431	628456	But see, here's the thing though, and even, we talked it over, like we were saying, what if, you know, we were put in that situation.
628857	633282	It's like, fuck that, just, you know, do whatever it takes to win the vacation, we'll forgive you.
633302	635844	It's like, that's, I don't know.
636085	637266	All you need to do is like,
638004	638905	and I'll see you next time.
657802	658402	Oh, Dead or Alive?
687287	688407	A whole crap load of it.
689648	691148	And, oh, I also play Twilight Zone.
694830	701772	Right now, though, we're fixing our Rocky and Bullwinkle machine, and we got an Earthshaker, which is old-school, cool pinball.
702492	704333	How are you fitting any more pinball machines in there?
704353	705233	I'm actually going to be selling some.
705534	705794	Oh, okay.
705994	707154	We have nine pinball machines.
708575	709515	Well, one of them's Will's.
710656	714137	We sold him our Judge Dredd.
715057	716277	I wanted to get rid of the Johnny Mnemonic.
716557	720018	I told Dan that if he gets rid of the Star Trek pinball, I would murder him in his sleep.
720638	722278	So we're probably going to sell our Guns N' Roses machine.
724118	724898	Oh, that's sad.
724918	725359	I love that machine.
725379	727279	And maybe we'll then come over and play it before we sell it.
727339	727899	I'm going to.
728019	729659	Because I need money for Adolfis.
729819	730559	After the show, okay.
730579	731760	Wait, wait, wait.
731800	734040	You're going to charge me quarters?
734620	734780	No.
735980	739721	We need to sell them so that I can use the money from Dan's pinball machines.
740834	741094	Mine.
743596	745697	Alpha Canogram says, Oh, snap!
745957	746818	Rocky and Bullwinkle.
747418	747939	Oh, snap.
748559	756224	I love Rocky and Bullwinkle, but... Well, the problem with our Rocky and Bullwinkle machine is that we need a new board for it, for the ROM set.
757085	759426	And right now the board's like, I'm going to be broken for a while.
760167	765030	And, you know, paying for school, so I've got to decide what's more important, my education or pinball.
765650	767331	Which is a really hard choice, but, you know.
768092	770153	Mike W. says, Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
771567	772688	CookieMama reference, of course.
774809	775729	Insert Ellipse here.
775749	777010	Okay, thanks, bye.
777230	778970	You need to have SugarMama the game.
779591	784153	Yes, I play that pretty often.
784593	784813	Wow.
784853	786114	Loki, how was your gaming week?
786274	787214	My gaming week was good.
787354	789515	I played more of the Crackdown demo, again.
789835	792937	I found the grenade launcher, which makes the game a lot more fun.
793377	795438	And then, what else did I do?
795458	798279	I played a little bit of...
801001	802961	Oh god, what the hell is that crappy PopCap game?
802981	806962	I don't know, it's some crappy PopCap game that's on live.
807662	808442	And, yeah.
809162	811303	I don't know, I'm just trying to get shooting points.
811323	814863	And I got bored real quick, so.
815264	816764	And then, let's see.
817184	819264	Played more Resistance.
819564	821465	I'm actually playing it the second time through.
821905	825345	And you get some more weapons, so it's like mildly fun.
826026	826906	More fun, I guess.
827906	828446	And then...
829824	831165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
848300	849181	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
865598	867119	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
885200	890604	It was just so retarded, so I have to play more Driver 3 now because I forgot how crappy that game is.
891144	900491	And probably now it's dirt cheap, so maybe pick up an actual copy of it instead of a pirated copy on my PlayStation 2 hard drive.
901412	903173	And then play it on the PlayStation 3.
904534	906596	But yeah, that's pretty much it.
907096	910699	Looking forward to playing some new stuff this week, hopefully.
911550	916395	Jared J says, oh god, I still can't believe I paid $50 for Driver 3 back in the day.
917036	917837	And you know what?
917997	923664	I can't believe I paid $50 for a game I played a little bit this week, Fusion Frenzy 2.
924966	929388	I picked up this game because the demo was kind of fun, and I thought, oh, well, you know, I love those little mini-games.
929408	930589	This will be, you know, a good time.
931089	933590	The best way I can describe this game is unpolished.
933790	935671	I mean, it's just, it feels sloppy.
935731	940794	Like, all these little cutscenes are bleh, and the games all look the same, and it's so bland.
941094	947557	How could a game with 40 mini-games that's basically Think Mario Party without the big board be so freaking bland?
947817	948278	But it is.
948378	948978	I was just so...
949835	951616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
961670	990818	The graphics from F-Zero on GameCube And just like, you know, they keep looping the same animation Which is amazing because the developers are completely different Yeah, but yeah, to me it had the same look to it And it was just kind of generic And the characters are all the same, it's just they're different colors And they use the same animation loops over and over again Instead of actually having new cutscenes And it's just, yeah, I just think they rushed through it So I do not recommend Fusion Frenzy 2 Unless you want easy achievement points Go rent it because you can get through the achievements pretty easy As I understand it
991127	996531	I racked up 75 pretty quickly just playing through it once and it wasn't anything that difficult, so yawn.
997011	1010400	And I know we're going to talk later in the show about the rewards program, but for those of you guys that are hoping to get this as a reward, you might find that they're just trying to unload the extra copies they're bound to have because this game is not fun.
1010440	1010900	I'm sorry.
1011221	1011881	Well, here's the thing.
1012502	1015904	Thank God that the Halo beta wasn't included with this game.
1017250	1019751	Root Beer Tapper Root Beer Tapper
1047574	1049976	You don't see the other player on your screen at all.
1050516	1055740	All you see is their score and how they're progressing in the game.
1055781	1056221	That's it.
1056781	1059263	So it doesn't lend itself very much to a co-op.
1060284	1062546	And they didn't even redo the graphics or anything.
1062666	1067830	So, I mean, I guess it's good that it's only $5, which is the cheapest that Microsoft will charge any game.
1067870	1075196	But expect this game to be the free toss-in on a lot of upcoming bundle stuff, like Xbox Live cards and things, because I just...
1076026	1082272	I don't think it's... As much as I love Root Beer Tapper, it didn't get the same treatment a lot of the other games did.
1082312	1084134	Therefore, I don't think it's as good of a value.
1084174	1086416	And it pains me to say that.
1086436	1087977	You mentioned that it's five bucks at the cheapest.
1087997	1089738	That's how it is on the Virtual Console and Nintendo.
1089979	1090539	What is with that?
1090559	1094663	I mean, to me, that's still kind of expensive for a game that came out like 20 years ago.
1095523	1098405	They made their money on it, they're just selling the bits over the internet.
1098465	1099506	It's kind of weird to me.
1099686	1101888	A lot of people have been making the same complaints you have.
1101948	1107031	Does a game like, I don't know, Tennis, and I'm not talking Wii Sports Tennis, I'm talking old school 8-bit Tennis.
1107051	1111914	Does a game like Tennis really justify the same price as a game like Super Mario Bros.?
1111934	1118239	Especially when I can go buy a Nintendo for pretty cheap and buy the cartridges for like 50 cents or less.
1119840	1123322	Or even if you want to go the illegal route, download the ROM, which...
1123700	1124901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1150914	1152035	Uh, comments from our chatroom.
1152095	1157518	JeremyTodd1 says, I hate Root Beer Tapper, but of course I didn't play it a long time ago, so that nostalgia factor isn't there.
1157578	1159079	But whatever, I still think the game sucks.
1159660	1162601	Uh, Brad from PodCulture says, I've been playing the hell out of Root Beer Tapper.
1162661	1163182	Fun times.
1163542	1164643	So, differing opinions.
1164943	1167284	I guess download the demo, see if it's something you like.
1167565	1168165	So, there you go.
1170153	1173157	There's a chatroom brawl breaking out over Root Beer Tapper.
1173197	1176501	In fact, I think some Root Beer glasses have just been shattered.
1176521	1178103	Why can't it just be Tapper with the beer?
1178703	1181046	Because it was Budweiser and that was sponsored.
1181206	1182868	And so you got product placement in there.
1182888	1184991	It's like why you couldn't do Mike Tyson's Punch-Out now.
1185732	1185932	Right?
1186252	1186773	Same type of thing.
1186813	1188794	Well, that's because he bit people's ears off.
1188834	1190615	That's why... Yeah, he's a cannibal.
1191736	1195279	Yeah, actually, Nintendo is going to be re-skinning Punch-Out!!
1195299	1202824	and it's going to be Mike Tyson's ear-biting and women-raping actually is going to be coming out to the Wii Virtual Console for only $5, Eddie!
1203264	1204565	It's going to play like Oonga Boonga.
1207867	1210829	Get the Wiimote and just, like, thrust it in there.
1210869	1212951	For those who don't know what Oonga Boonga is, just...
1213664	1215185	It's the finger up the ass game.
1215206	1216407	No, just don't research it.
1216467	1217608	Don't look it up on Wikipedia.
1217628	1218769	You should totally see it.
1219149	1219950	Oh, man, Loki.
1220250	1223012	You can address those cards and letters to Loki at orangebonusradio.com.
1223073	1225375	It's the finger up the ass for a tickets game.
1226876	1228517	Why can't we have ticket games like that over here?
1228537	1229298	That'd be hilarious.
1230339	1230759	Let's see.
1231080	1238126	Let's go over and check in with Rice Princess and Casper the Gay and see if there's anything they've been playing this week real quick.
1239195	1243576	I've been playing Ooga Booga, but, like, on my own body with someone else.
1243596	1244056	You're disgusting.
1244116	1245797	But I don't dispense tickets.
1245897	1248277	I'm just like, ooh, awesome.
1248577	1249498	You're disgusting.
1250058	1251938	Eddie, what have you been playing this week?
1252098	1254799	I've been playing Hot Sex.
1257140	1259180	Are you guys drunk on this program tonight?
1259600	1260421	They're high on life.
1260441	1261321	They're wearing hats.
1261561	1262481	I know this is radio.
1262941	1264382	Maybe we can take some pictures and put them on the website.
1264402	1265042	But they're wearing hats.
1265422	1265742	And, like...
1266369	1270955	Um, Rice Princess is wearing a frickin' Shamrock hat, and it's like not even March yet.
1272977	1275440	Eddie, uh, Eddie, Casper the Game, what have you been playing?
1275460	1281007	Yeah, big surprise, I downloaded, uh, Link the Bass when it came out on Virtual Console, but I was kinda mad, I was like, that was $8, I was like, holy crap.
1281374	1281854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1306212	1306973	Oh, I forgot.
1306993	1308054	I've been playing Super Mario World.
1308534	1309015	I beat it.
1309135	1310917	I beat Super Mario World because I'm awesome.
1310937	1311817	You beat it last night.
1311878	1313479	I used Star World to get there quickly.
1313559	1314220	Hey, Rob.
1314280	1315801	I've beaten Super Mario World 2.
1315921	1316602	Hey, Jamie.
1316702	1317803	About 10 years ago.
1317823	1318664	Kiss my ass.
1319425	1319725	No.
1320686	1321827	Boonga boonga my ass?
1321867	1322748	I don't know where that's been.
1323769	1325291	I'll help you out there, Rob.
1325331	1326392	You guys are filthy.
1326792	1327713	Explicit tag.
1327733	1328013	Boonk.
1328394	1328694	All right.
1330063	1331864	because, you know, it has to do with your butt, I guess.
1332344	1333345	Oh, my God!
1333365	1334165	I like your shirt.
1334345	1338227	We watched the bullshit episode about the ass last night.
1339128	1339888	Video games?
1340068	1340328	Anybody?
1340348	1341529	Does anybody play them?
1341589	1345391	I'm trying to segue into video games again by commenting on your shirt.
1345491	1346131	Oh, sure, yes.
1346151	1346751	It's a lovely shirt.
1346871	1347092	I am.
1347132	1348772	I'm wearing a very hot Tanuki shirt.
1348792	1349933	I'm going to pose for the camera right now.
1350313	1350633	Look at me.
1350693	1351414	I'm all sexy.
1351934	1352334	God damn it.
1352354	1354215	You can't even see the Tanuki when you do that, Rob.
1354375	1355216	Move your fucking microphone.
1355236	1356356	This is great radio, by the way.
1356956	1357917	No, it's not at all.
1358878	1359819	I swear to god I'm not making this up.
1359859	1361120	And then the woman behind the counter was like, um...
1387833	1391255	Was that the Mario where you, like, killed things with your tail?
1393776	1394957	Because I'm not sure.
1395037	1400420	Because I've been sitting behind here all day doing nothing, and it's starting to get in my brain, because nobody shops at Radio Shack.
1401781	1402041	Rob.
1402541	1402742	What?
1403202	1403982	Oh, more pictures.
1404583	1406224	I feel like... Do you want a satellite TV?
1406244	1408005	I feel like Anna Nicole Smith, only alive.
1408025	1409165	This is nice.
1410126	1411587	I'm taking a picture of Rob's shirt.
1411687	1412247	Too soon?
1412687	1413848	One, two, five.
1414655	1415175	Ah, thank you.
1415255	1415936	It's blurry, oh well.
1416216	1418757	Alright, anyway, let's get into... And I'm not uploading it either.
1419037	1422778	Let's get into some actual gaming news, because we don't really have any housekeeping tonight.
1423078	1425439	Visit our MySpace... Oh, you have some housekeeping?
1425459	1426099	What do you want to say?
1426119	1428060	Well, just that you need some housekeeping.
1429921	1430281	Shut up.
1431241	1434482	Loki, save this show with some awesome exclusives.
1434502	1436123	That would be, like, the best thing ever if you could, like,
1436843	1438823	Give us some video game news no one's heard yet.
1439123	1443464	How about the entire lineup for Xbox 360 from Microsoft this year?
1443504	1444184	That'd be great.
1444284	1444745	How about that?
1445625	1451346	Let's start off then with Blue Dragon, which has been announced now for July 11th.
1452106	1453066	So look forward to that.
1453426	1455927	Project Sylphid on the 360 for May 16th.
1455947	1457167	Tenchu Z coming out June 12th.
1463349	1465610	2 Human, also May 16th.
1466050	1468350	Mass Effect, coming out May 30th.
1468711	1470751	Shadowrun, June 13th.
1471291	1475312	Forza 2 is slated for May 16th as well.
1475332	1476393	Man, that's going to be a pretty big day.
1476953	1479393	Because I know Halo 3 is around that time too.
1479493	1480674	I'm sure some of this stuff is going to move.
1480694	1485335	And then on top of all those games we have coming out, of course,
1486091	1489213	They're going to be having a 4,000 point live card coming out in April.
1489673	1495797	So if you didn't really want to spend $20 on live points at the store, now you can spend $40 on live points at the store.
1496297	1498218	Or, I actually know that's more than $50.
1498938	1499278	I'm sorry.
1499459	1506102	I was kind of wondering at first why they would be doing this, but then I think the movie rentals, you know, you can spend a lot of points really quickly on the movie rentals.
1506322	1511325	So folks that are downloading the HD movies, I can see... Those cards sell well because people buy them as gifts.
1511765	1512766	Yeah, I can see that.
1512886	1514007	They're like iTunes cards.
1514027	1514267	Exactly.
1514327	1514707	Exactly.
1515177	1517618	So that's going to be pretty cool.
1517878	1519599	Tetris Evolution is actually coming out.
1519619	1522780	Remember Tetris Grandmaster was one of the launch titles in Japan.
1522800	1526161	Now it's making over here the cheapest 360 game I've seen.
1526941	1531582	This is a retail price point of $29.99 when it's coming out in March.
1531843	1532483	Good job.
1532503	1534704	A moment of applause, please, for this.
1535164	1535924	Applause, please.
1538311	1539792	Low price points are awesome.
1540372	1542534	Got some bad news though.
1542714	1544915	Mario Party 8 has been delayed to June.
1545335	1546636	Or not June, May.
1546876	1549038	May 15th.
1549598	1550379	How do you know this?
1550639	1552480	This is groundbreaking news.
1552680	1561546	Because us distributors talk to the publishers on a daily basis, so they will give us updates to dates all the time.
1561606	1566789	And even usually before press releases go out, we get announcements for stuff that hasn't been announced yet.
1567413	1570995	or maybe announced at certain retail spots but no one's paying attention.
1572676	1578400	Don't worry guys, you can play Fusion Frenzy 2 in the meantime and then poop on it because it's bad.
1578420	1579901	Because you had to play Fusion Frenzy.
1580201	1585184	To be honest though, most of the Wii games coming out now have party games in them.
1585244	1590267	I know Sonic the Hedgehog, the brand new one, Sonic and the Secret Rings has actually party games in it as well.
1590607	1591268	They look kind of fun.
1592989	1594470	Yes, Rice Princess has a question.
1595070	1596131	Are the Secret Rings
1597049	1606117	And finally, the remakes of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 are slated for the PSP June 13th.
1606397	1607058	That's huge!
1607418	1609280	So that'll be pretty nice as well.
1610120	1612282	Wow, those are some huge dates you're giving us there.
1612682	1613463	Good job, Loki.
1613983	1617226	So I'm just glad to see that some actual games are coming out.
1617747	1620629	I'm not sure if Microsoft's going to be stacking that many games in May.
1620909	1625153	They might try to shuffle stuff around a little bit to kind of spread out the fun, but
1626389	1627490	Lots of good stuff for the summer.
1629592	1630773	Awesome.
1631113	1633695	Did you just paste that picture of my shirt?
1633715	1634095	Yes, I did.
1634115	1634716	Oh my gosh.
1634796	1636717	It's kind of blurry.
1636957	1638759	You can see my big fat stomach in there.
1638859	1639519	That's very nice.
1640260	1642942	I got a cool shirt today.
1643142	1646985	Some of the perks of being in our chat room live when the show is going on Sunday at 6 o'clock.
1647005	1648466	This is Captain America for President.
1650788	1651929	I love Captain America.
1652509	1654971	I want a shirt that says Reggie Fils-Aimé for President.
1655547	1657388	I'd vote for Captain America.
1657488	1658128	Oh, damn it.
1658208	1665292	Rob, I hate you, and I've hated you for years.
1665332	1666252	Oh, thank you.
1667393	1669354	I love you, too.
1669474	1672595	Aw, hugs.
1672635	1673776	Don't really touch me, Rob.
1673796	1675577	What the hell is wrong with the program tonight?
1676337	1676977	I don't know.
1677437	1679919	Oh, Fireboma says Sky needs to lose a good 200 pounds.
1679939	1679979	Oh!
1685276	1695404	In related news, Fireboma just got kicked from chat.
1695845	1698587	If you come back in, Fireboma, I'm going to sit on you.
1698987	1701950	For those who have never seen Rob, he's like the skinniest man ever.
1702831	1703111	What?
1703491	1707875	The only way your ass would weigh 500 pounds is if you wore a metal diaper.
1709198	1709879	And you pooped in it?
1709979	1712640	Anyway, God, what is wrong with this program tonight?
1713101	1714001	Shit, pure shit.
1714282	1721426	No, um, I was just saying that I saw a really cute shirt that was, um, Caps Lock, Cruise Control for Awesome.
1721847	1723608	And I really want that shirt a lot.
1723908	1724989	Wait, what is that a reference to?
1725009	1725649	I don't even get it.
1726010	1727250	Do you know what Caps Lock is?
1727651	1731213	Well, I know what the Caps Lock is, but... It's Cruise Control for Awesome!
1731273	1732574	Hello, you don't get it?
1732934	1736857	And I saw this other one where the front says Ding, and on the back it says Grapp.
1737625	1738405	Alice in Wonderland
1756747	1759468	This would be American McGee's Alice, as you know, being made into a movie.
1759828	1764811	Now, I apologize to the source, because I don't think I'm supposed to name the source.
1765051	1767152	But if you wanted to be named, then I apologize.
1767492	1774055	But this information is coming from a very trusted source of Orange Laundry, somebody I've been working with for a while, who just happened to come across this.
1774675	1778977	I can't really say how, but got to read the script, the current script as it is for Alice.
1779277	1781618	Now, keep in mind, these things change all the time.
1782037	1786340	Alice, as a child, is confronted by her parents due to her uncontrollable fascination with Wonderland.
1812000	1819584	Against Alice's protest that Wonderland exists, Alice's father takes down possibly anything in her room that would insinuate any thought related to Wonderland.
1819965	1825227	Later that night, the house is burned down and the only survivor found is Alice, splattered with blood on her body.
1826128	1829110	Forward to the future, Alice is staying in a mental institution.
1829390	1838575	An MD, Dr. Hatfield, get it, is interested in Alice and transfers her to another institution, even though doctors tell Hatfield that Alice is impossible to cure.
1839261	1843684	Alice then begins a new treatment at the new institution, which is looking more and more abnormal to Alice.
1844105	1855192	Alice's old meds are no longer given to her, the other patients are deranged, but one sane doctor named Doyle seems to be the only sane one, and Alice pleads to him for help as she claims she's not who or what she really is.
1855733	1860176	Alice's treatments are getting worse and crueler, and gets wind of Hatfield's surgeries.
1861238	1869165	After escaping a scuffle from getting into her first surgery, she follows a rabbit she barely saw in the middle of her struggle and follows it into you-know-where.
1869645	1878292	Now, apparently there were some notes on the script as well, some possible movies, because some movie names were kind of written on here, some movies that this could be influenced from.
1878593	1884978	Twelve Monkeys, Seven, Perfect Storm, Pan's Labyrinth, Jacob's Ladder, What Dreams May Come, Lord of the Rings.
1885418	1889522	And then some bands were written on there as well, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Butthole Surfers,
1889872	1899377	specifically Chris Vrena of Nine Inch Nails as well, electronic industrial hip-hop music, and then this is the movie genre, psycho horror action.
1899937	1900857	So, what do you think?
1901117	1902118	Sounds kind of neat?
1902358	1903398	Sounds true to the game?
1903458	1903899	What do you think?
1904679	1905259	It sounds neat.
1905319	1906780	I haven't played the game, but it sounds neat.
1907060	1909561	I did years ago, but I don't remember it very well.
1909581	1910882	I watched a speedrun of the game.
1910902	1911242	Did you?
1912623	1913263	It could be okay.
1913523	1915044	Yeah, so it sounds like it could be interesting.
1915564	1916705	Mention a movie I saw today.
1917325	1917625	What's that?
1918105	1919166	I saw Pan's Labyrinth today.
1919696	1920737	JV Mon says, this sounds awesome.
1944332	1945432	So it could be very interesting.
1945653	1948694	Padrino says, I do believe it can be real since the scripts have to make the rounds.
1948814	1950054	I believe it's real too.
1950414	1954016	But I think, you know, as most scripts do, it's probably going to change a bunch before we see the final product.
1954076	1954676	But there you have it.
1955056	1958478	Your first look into what the Alice movie has in store.
1959658	1959978	All right.
1960038	1962759	So how about some other news circulating the Internet this week?
1963039	1965580	Well, there's a little bit of happiness going on.
1967481	1969382	For all of us who have been...
1970345	1975391	Begging and pleading for Nintendo to do a kitty kitty version of Nintendogs.
1975451	1976612	Well, somebody else is doing it.
1977273	1979475	Crave is putting out Purr Pals for the DS.
1980056	1988786	You can choose 40 breeds of kitties and pet them and love them and call them George and you can raise them, you know.
1990308	1990448	It's...
1992114	1993995	It's funny, this mentions modifying cat behavior.
1994775	1995016	No.
1995376	1998137	Yeah, cats modify your behavior.
1998497	2001458	Am I the only one disappointed that they did not call this Pussy Pals?
2005180	2007361	I love that this article put up a cat macro, though.
2008641	2009782	It says, where is your god now?
2011783	2013103	Are you going to be picking up Purr Pals?
2013783	2014244	Probably.
2014544	2016124	Can it do Nintendogs justice?
2016284	2016545	Because...
2018800	2019161	What's that?
2019321	2019661	Kitty.
2019821	2022364	The graphical style is totally different from like a Nintendog.
2022404	2023425	It's not realistic cats.
2023505	2025007	It's like cartoony alien cats.
2025227	2025988	Well, then never mind.
2026008	2027590	They have a video of it on IGN.
2028210	2029672	They have a video of it on other sites?
2029692	2031494	I usually avoid IGN like the plague, though.
2031794	2032135	You know.
2033070	2035911	Except I got lots of Rondo of blood.
2036212	2037112	They do have a lot of videos.
2037152	2040494	You know, there was a Cats game that's already been out on the DS.
2040754	2042315	You can do the exact same thing.
2042355	2046137	It's called Cats, with a Z at the end, you know, because they're extreme.
2046157	2047737	They did a dogs one, too.
2047777	2050339	Yeah, they have the dogs, horses, hamsters.
2050839	2056822	Wait, do these cats, like, go base jumping and, like, extreme snowboarding and stuff?
2057162	2058363	They're hardcore cats.
2058423	2060464	They do crystal meth and go to raves.
2065755	2066075	Wow.
2066775	2072638	They should have it like, you know, they should have it where the cats actually start scratching the DS and you're like, what the fuck?
2072818	2074599	Why is your throw up in my DS?
2074659	2075679	You know, just stuff like that.
2075699	2079701	They should hack up hairballs and then poo on your, you know, your bathroom rug.
2080161	2085823	Of course, the chat room is all clamoring out in unison for Love Hamster, which was a game we talked about.
2085863	2087484	Hamster does not have a pee in it.
2087764	2090105	TheRobD says, you're just an intent pussy, Rob.
2090711	2091672	Ha ha ha ha ha!
2119994	2149408	you may want to seek a better copy from Codemasters I think it would be great if there were only 31 levels so they like send it in and it's only one more level and it's like oh okay gotcha thank you wow yeah and that's the same GS68 asks the same thing in chat but can you pass level 31 don't know so what do you think guys now do we do we ease up
2150234	2154537	on the folks behind Bubble Bobble for the DS and not make any more level 30 jokes?
2155418	2155658	No.
2156498	2157699	You know what I think it really was?
2157839	2165544	I think they just didn't finish it on time, so they purposely made it so you couldn't pass 30, and so that gave them, like, more time to create more levels and stuff.
2165584	2167846	And they're like, yeah, now we've fixed it.
2167946	2169927	Yeah, now you can totally get past level 30.
2170007	2176792	Well, I've read an interesting theory about that this is just a reflection of the general laziness in QA and testing, because, like, what
2177433	2180716	The 360 and other next-gen systems have allowed you to do it with patching.
2181336	2184578	Because companies are too spoiled now with the whole patching thing.
2184618	2186580	If bugs are discovered, eh, they can go back and patch it.
2186940	2190643	But the problem is, you can't really patch a DS game without doing a massive recall.
2190843	2194165	So, I mean, is this maybe why this happened?
2194185	2196287	Possibly.
2196767	2202851	I mean, they obviously didn't playtest it because if, you know, oh, I can't pass level 30, I just must suck.
2203012	2204833	That's okay, other people will be better than I am.
2206234	2206294	So.
2207316	2207636	All right.
2208477	2210637	Well, moving on into other news.
2211138	2215299	Speaking of big letdowns, you might remember we even got a call on this last week.
2215600	2219621	Somebody had said, hey, what do you think Konami's big announcement is?
2219641	2224844	Because remember we gave the rundown on Konami Gamers Day last week, right, about the show and all the games we played.
2225164	2232327	But Konami had put on their site, hey, boys and girls, stay tuned until Monday because we got some big shit, yo, that we're going to be laying down.
2232347	2233067	I know what it is.
2233087	2233607	What was it?
2233947	2234388	I know what it is.
2234548	2234688	What?
2235293	2235874	Thanks for watching!
2249710	2255731	All got me this little USB Frogger controller, and all you have to do is plug it into the USB port and it installs the game and you can play it.
2256011	2258952	And I'm here to tell you, the game sucks balls.
2259392	2260652	Well, that's what we wanted for you.
2260672	2264493	Horrible, horrible, sloppy, wrinkly balls is what this game sucks.
2264633	2265333	It's horrid.
2265813	2266813	Ew, that's gross.
2266953	2271594	And, like, I spent more time staring at the now-loading screen than I did actually playing the game.
2272054	2273054	Well, that's half the fun.
2273474	2274954	Was this, like, on clearance?
2275514	2275854	No.
2276034	2277795	Yeah, yeah, meaning yes.
2277915	2278315	Not.
2278495	2278755	Okay.
2278775	2279095	Not a dollar.
2281682	2283302	Was it seriously four bucks?
2283823	2284203	Wow.
2284643	2285944	It might be worth four bucks.
2285984	2294947	Not to make fun of Konami or anything, but... Hey, look, we gave glowing reviews of Gamers Day last week, so I think I can say this shitty little $4 thing sucks, okay?
2295167	2296308	They're not going to cry.
2296708	2308353	Do you remember the first Gamers Day we went to, and even the second, like that summer thing, that they had a whole booth set up that they'd show you how to use the USB key thing?
2308633	2308893	I'm like...
2310034	2311134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2333007	2335208	And then here was, here was the big announcement.
2335628	2336428	Here was this quote.
2336888	2340849	Last week, Konami announced new games in its Castlevania and DDR series.
2341169	2345890	It's going to be an incredible 2007, so stay tuned to these pages for the latest from Konami.
2348331	2349731	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
2349891	2354132	I mean, everybody was thinking, oh, it's going to be the Metal Gear Solid 4 information.
2354272	2355613	Oh, it's going to be Silent Hill Origins.
2355713	2356313	Oh, Silent Hill 5.
2356853	2360754	No, it was, hey, our big announcement is that we already made our announcements.
2360834	2361134	Sorry.
2361234	2361334	What?
2361687	2362107	That's it?
2362147	2362647	That was it!
2363808	2364849	Not even a reach around?
2366830	2367270	Nothing.
2367290	2367730	I'm bitter.
2368170	2368610	Nothing.
2369051	2373653	Free shitty USB Frogger games for everybody!
2373773	2374773	Yay!
2378935	2381757	If only Barman X Zero were $4.
2381857	2386979	I'm tempted to wrap this up in toilet paper and give it away on the station to a lucky listener.
2388618	2390539	Is there going to be poop on that toilet?
2390579	2391420	No, maybe.
2392120	2393241	Ew, but I don't want it.
2393281	2394802	No, maybe some Hershey's Kisses or something.
2395182	2395823	All right, anyway.
2396143	2396843	From your butt.
2396943	2398704	What is wrong with tonight's program?
2398765	2404368	It's like it's, oh, I know, it's that Rice Princess and Eddie the Gay are here, but this program's like off tonight.
2404808	2406349	Did you say Eddie the Gay?
2406449	2407310	Eddie the Gay.
2407490	2408551	Eddie Casper the Gay.
2408571	2409591	That's his full name, right?
2413754	2414415	I know I'm awesome.
2414515	2416576	All right, who's got the next story?
2416676	2417056	Is it me?
2417096	2417717	Your mom.
2417837	2418057	Oh, no.
2419642	2420463	Jamie, I believe it's you.
2421103	2421383	Is it?
2421543	2421623	Oh.
2421664	2421884	Yes.
2422164	2423004	I'm not your mom.
2423905	2424645	That would be wrong.
2426206	2430248	So, looks like Activision has a hair up their ass.
2430829	2432750	Because they're suing their own people.
2432770	2433670	Well, not really their own people.
2433690	2436792	But they're suing people who worked on Guitar Hero now.
2438153	2444496	Remember that whole big stink they were having with the Ant Commandos for the unlicensed guitar controller?
2445176	2446117	Well, they're suing them again.
2446915	2454398	and also including as defendants some folks that were with Red Octane previously.
2455358	2461861	That would be John Tam, Corey... Wasn't John Tam the dude that went to your house?
2461901	2462341	Yes, he is.
2462701	2463222	Huh, funny.
2463462	2463922	He was pretty cool.
2463942	2464602	I mean, not funny.
2464662	2465462	I'm sorry, John.
2466163	2468824	It's not funny, but just interesting.
2469004	2469264	Sorry.
2469704	2470264	Small world.
2470885	2471945	I'll just sit down and shut up.
2473683	2485927	Also included is Corey Fong and Jamie Yang, who actually started another company that's working in conjunction with the Ant Commandos.
2487687	2496190	So in other words, these guys left Red Octane to go work with the Ant Commandos on a yet unannounced game that probably has something to do with guitars.
2496836	2509343	Well, Activision is accusing them of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, misappropriating trade secrets, and confidential information, breach of contract, interference with construction relations, and being stinky.
2509923	2512465	I'm glad they don't remember, like, before 2005.
2513365	2515366	I mean, just, hmm.
2516207	2517007	Katara freaks.
2517347	2517947	Ring a bell?
2518268	2518748	Anybody?
2519188	2519508	No?
2520269	2522290	I even brought that up in a conversation.
2522790	2524431	Like, well, yeah, but we're different.
2525573	2526354	No you're not!
2526394	2527495	To be fair, they are.
2528696	2529717	Okay, they have five buttons.
2529737	2531799	Guitar Hero, no, it's more than that.
2531859	2532379	You know it.
2532460	2532940	You know it.
2532980	2536143	The game has a completely different look and feel than Guitar Freaks does.
2536522	2539044	and it's crossed over into popularity in a way.
2539064	2539544	I'm sorry.
2539624	2540525	I'm sorry, Bomani fans.
2540545	2541686	Guitar freaks could never do.
2541886	2542547	Okay, fine.
2542647	2547310	If I put Keyboard Mania and made it look like Karaoke Revolution, oh, look, I got Keyboard Hero.
2547711	2550653	That's all he fucking did is they changed the way the game looks.
2550993	2552134	Okay, great.
2552334	2554756	The notes come at me instead of straight up.
2554996	2556978	You know what other game did the exact same thing?
2557198	2557818	In the groove.
2557898	2561521	How is that different from you have a game like...
2562942	2573468	I don't know, you have a platformer game like Mario where he jumps and hits things, and then you have another game with a hero like, I don't know, The Legend of Kage where he jumps and hits things.
2573508	2574528	I don't know, that's really obscure.
2574548	2575609	It's exactly the same.
2575629	2577250	That's exactly the same.
2577270	2579271	So why isn't it a problem there?
2580043	2580763	Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat
2608211	2609351	Thank you, that's an excellent example, though.
2609371	2610412	What about King of Fighters?
2610472	2611572	What about World Heroes?
2611612	2612552	What about Art of Fighting?
2612592	2613473	What about Street Fighter?
2613553	2617194	Art of Fighting, World Heroes, and King of Fighters were all SNK, so they can get away with it.
2617214	2617614	That's fine.
2617654	2618394	Here's what I'm saying, though.
2618414	2619535	But they're all Street Fighter.
2619735	2620695	Here's what I'm saying, though.
2621175	2623476	Finn Fury actually had multi-plane fighting.
2624116	2625337	Okay, well, here's what I'm saying.
2625437	2630200	If the fucking originators of Fatal Fury came out and said, Oh, we're pissed off that people are copying our game.
2630480	2631220	No, fuck them.
2631260	2633602	They were second in line or third in line.
2633922	2635122	They have no room to talk.
2635302	2642947	It's just like, you know, if the originators of In the Groove came out and said, Oh, we're pissed off that, you know, Dance Factory came out.
2642987	2643727	Well, fuck you.
2643807	2645108	You copied someone else.
2645188	2647229	Sighting games were actually around well before Street Fighter.
2647309	2650671	But also, let's not forget, though, remember the old... How's this for obscure?
2650691	2650731	Um...
2652498	2655961	Pac-Man vs. KC Crazy Chase for the Odyssey 2.
2657322	2662206	That game is now so hard to find because of being sued by Williams and Midway.
2663047	2663928	But it's the same thing.
2664488	2670173	Maze games have been around in a physical form before there were... Remember the old Mousetrap games?
2671454	2672655	They existed beforehand.
2674137	2676739	I just think it's just a double standard right now that they really...
2677958	2680460	That's what this country was founded on, double standards.
2680620	2689505	Well, the whole problem is that Konami didn't do anything to protect their guitar freaks, patents or whatever they had there, so now they can't really stand on that.
2689905	2694068	But I still think it's retarded that they're suing over this game.
2695368	2695789	You know what?
2695889	2698070	Harmonix is working on something else right now.
2698150	2700211	It's going to blow this shit away, and then whatever.
2700251	2703153	Everyone's going to get a big boner over that, so whatever.
2704614	2704894	Anywho.
2705307	2724535	Speaking of Guitar Hero, Activision is definitely showing their interest in the Nintendo platforms, talking about doubling their, or aggressively targeting the Wii and DS for titles such as the Spider-Man, Shrek, etc., and talking about bringing Guitar Hero to the Wii.
2725396	2730698	Although, what I've been reading, though, is it might not actually be Guitar Hero, it might be some other guitar game.
2731739	2735000	But still, though, yeah, I guess you could do that, but
2735990	2737471	The DS, I don't know about that.
2737551	2738871	That'd be kind of dumb.
2739611	2740272	But we'll see.
2741192	2743433	Yeah, how exactly do you do Guitar Hero on the DS?
2743553	2744693	Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
2744753	2745373	That's kind of dumb.
2745613	2745793	Yeah.
2746194	2746474	I don't know.
2747574	2750695	Maybe something with like you hold the chords with the stylet.
2750795	2751135	I don't know.
2751235	2751936	That's kind of lame.
2752516	2754517	But then that's why I don't design games, I guess.
2755737	2756877	Maybe I'll have a thumb peripheral.
2758118	2761359	Anyhow, some other Konami music game related news.
2761439	2764240	I should state, by the way, we were the first website anywhere
2764639	2770963	and the planet to run the official song list of DDR Universe on the Xbox 360.
2771103	2773024	The default song list, what it's going to look like there.
2773985	2777507	Our very own staffer, Mel B, did some work on that and found that.
2777547	2779508	So if you want to see that, head on over to orangeontrader.com.
2779908	2781489	Very interesting lineup, I've got to say.
2781549	2783490	Cascada, you know, Every Time We Touch is in it.
2784271	2786272	Rapper's Delight by the Sugar Hill Gang is in it.
2786292	2787012	That's got to be fun.
2787432	2790234	And Kylie Minogue is in it as well, so it's going to be fun.
2790254	2793276	I hope it has an equally retarded video like it did in Pump It Up.
2794043	2794783	I don't know, we'll see.
2794963	2795744	That was hilarious.
2796684	2800745	Also, I wanted to say this regarding official Konami music games.
2801545	2805027	There's an interesting report on Bomani Style that was run earlier this week.
2805447	2814990	We received our first confirmation from Betson that Beatmania 2DX Arcade will soon be testing in the next few weeks in Illinois at Brunswick Zone in Naperville.
2815750	2821172	No version has been confirmed as of yet, although it is rumored to be Beatmania 2DX Gold.
2821872	2822072	So,
2822717	2828940	What this is basically saying is that possibly Betson could be distributing Beatmania 2DX gold here in the States.
2829760	2834642	Usually Beatmania 2DX machines have to be imported from other countries, which is why you see them so, so rarely.
2835082	2846807	But very interesting that they would do this now, because Konami didn't announce a Beatmania 2 at their Gamers Day, and they came out with Beatmania 1 last year, which makes me think, I don't know if a Beatmania 2 is coming out for the home.
2847287	2850849	So what would be the strategy of them trying to release one in the arcades?
2851129	2851689	I don't know.
2852290	2852910	What do you think, though?
2852950	2857494	Do you think they should release Beatmania 2DX over here in the arcades, or do you think it's a lost cause?
2858374	2860756	Well, there's been places that's had it for years anyway.
2862297	2863938	But they're very niche places, you know?
2863958	2870442	Yeah, and the thing is that the majority of arcades are really going to be really lazy and not want to upkeep that type of machine.
2871003	2875225	So if it's going to be around, it's only going to be at major places that are guaranteed to be well kept.
2875286	2880349	Other than that, they're going to be wasting however many thousand dollars a machine is on something they don't want to keep up.
2882222	2886585	JV Mon says get hype through the arcades and then people would be like, hey, I want to play that at home.
2886725	2890908	So maybe this is a way for them to light a fire under the Beatmania franchise at home.
2891388	2891728	I don't know.
2893069	2899273	I had heard the series didn't do that bad, but the fact that they didn't announce a sequel kind of makes you worry.
2899774	2903516	Eh, not really, because I'm wondering if they just don't know what they're going to do with platforms.
2903576	2909420	I mean, if you think about it, say they haven't started a Beatmania 2 yet, where's the
2911286	2912087	Say in November.
2912247	2913188	I mean, they don't know.
2913448	2916250	So it's kind of a risky thing to do.
2916350	2920034	That's why there weren't really any PlayStation 2 games announced at Gamers Day.
2920874	2922176	Gaming Nerd says something interesting.
2922636	2924417	2DX barely gets any money in the U.S.
2924478	2925218	to begin with.
2925418	2926840	2DX Gold will be no different.
2926900	2932064	But, you know, what if they take the Beatmania 2DX machines out of the niche arcades that have them now?
2932124	2933625	You know, the arcades that are willing to import games.
2933886	2935307	And they put them in your local bowling alley.
2935866	2939009	Your local other arcade would stand to make more.
2939129	2942052	Plus, the machines are going to be cheaper if they're done here domestically.
2942072	2943693	They're going to be half as much, I think.
2943793	2944133	I don't know.
2944214	2944974	I'm just guessing.
2945395	2948317	But they might stand to make more profit.
2948457	2948938	Just a thought.
2949358	2954783	Unfortunately, those machines, it's just that they have the giant plasma screen on it and stuff.
2954803	2958486	I mean, granted, there are a lot of machines nowadays that have giant plasma screens.
2958826	2959547	But, you know,
2960526	2968368	I know with Golfland, for example, when you have little kids fucking breaking that shit, replacing a plasma screen isn't cheap, and that's, you know, bad.
2971869	2975470	One can only hope, though, that if we're going to get it, it's going to at least be in good shape.
2975990	2981972	Well, I have a little bit of something that will be in good shape because, well, it's brand new.
2983012	2984733	So we have our UK release dates.
2984773	2985293	How's that sound?
2985993	2986433	Yippee!
2987393	2989414	Coming out on...
2991279	2992940	The 16th is a bunch of stuff.
2992980	2996161	We have Armed Assault.
2996941	2998282	Is it Arm A, I guess?
2999282	3014827	Arthur and the Invisibles, Cartoon Network Racing, Excite Truck, God Hand, Infernal, Mario Hoops 3 on 3, Over the Hedge, Hammy Goes Nuts, Sherlock Holmes, The Awakened, Supreme Commander, Toko, Race Driver 3, and Tortuga, Two Treasures.
3018448	3018669	Great.
3019789	3019909	Wow.
3020950	3021170	Great.
3022051	3023291	Sorry, I seem kind of short.
3023992	3025973	Well, it's... Yeah, I guess it's a slow month.
3025993	3026853	All at the same time, yeah.
3027253	3028614	I'm looking at the Japanese release dates.
3028634	3030075	They're not much longer, but... Yeah.
3030635	3033077	I mean, the U.S., it's a pretty decent week, at least.
3033117	3035418	We're going to see some new stuff for the Wii with Wii Play.
3035798	3040801	So if you're, you know, short or remote and need to buy one for cheap, Wii Play is the way to go.
3041581	3050506	And then, of course, if you're not in or don't have a Wii, on PlayStation 2, Ghost Rider, which is kind of a ripoff of God of War, but...
3051048	3053649	God of War is not a bad game, so definitely worth checking out.
3053869	3055009	It's also cheap, only $29.99.
3055769	3057850	I played Ghost Rider at E3.
3057990	3059090	I don't know how much the game's changed.
3059110	3060110	I mean, granted, it's been six months.
3060350	3062131	That game sucked ass at E3.
3062171	3062951	I'm sorry, it was horrid.
3063051	3064311	It looks a lot better now.
3064371	3068612	Well, that's encouraging, because maybe they took all the negative feedback from E3 and did some retooling.
3068632	3069092	I think so.
3069192	3070533	It looks pretty... All right, then.
3070833	3071953	I retract my statement.
3072033	3073373	A game can change a lot in six months.
3073533	3075614	It looks very similar to God of War-like.
3076532	3078074	Very ripped off of God of War.
3078394	3085420	Anyways, The Warriors is coming out on PSP, and that's pretty inexpensive as well, only $19.99.
3086100	3087181	So definitely check it out.
3088282	3092105	Ratchet & Clank Size Matters on the PSP, if you're a Ratchet & Clank fan.
3092846	3098931	Galactic Civilizations 2 Dark Avatar, the expansion pack for that game is finally coming out.
3099652	3103515	Test Drive Unlimited on PC, finally making its way to the market.
3104584	3107986	Guramin, A Monstrous Adventure on the PSP.
3108206	3109226	Brand new Atlus game.
3110547	3112868	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas on the PSP.
3113008	3114309	Lots of PSP love this week.
3116269	3117890	Monster Kingdom Jewel Summoner.
3120972	3121212	What?
3122392	3122812	I'm sorry.
3122912	3124333	Stop making comments behind me!
3124373	3125814	No, we're not making comments at you.
3125894	3128535	I'm flashing my chest at Irene.
3129976	3131256	Stop getting Irene excited.
3132397	3132897	It's really...
3134344	3135224	Really distracting.
3135644	3136065	Anyways.
3136565	3137925	Thank God we're not a TV show.
3138105	3139606	Dream Lords on the PC.
3140226	3141086	Brand new MMO.
3142267	3146128	And then finally, a GameStop exclusive, Tulip.
3146188	3148569	I gotta tell you, this game looks like... Wait, it's a GameStop exclusive?
3148649	3149729	It's a GameStop exclusive.
3149769	3150010	Oh, Jesus.
3150090	3152610	And it looks like a piece of... Wait, wait.
3152791	3157292	I played this game at E3 like two years ago when it was first... It was cute.
3157352	3158993	I mean, it isn't... Is it 1999?
3159033	3159713	Because that might be okay.
3159773	3160053	I don't know.
3163007	3167010	But, um, yeah, I mean, it isn't going to win any awards, but it was cute.
3167130	3168691	I mean, you know what you're getting into, okay?
3168731	3170272	It's a game called Tulip, for Christ's sake.
3171272	3171573	Yeah.
3173434	3174374	It's a kissing simulator.
3174394	3175355	Yeah, it's a kissing game.
3175435	3176536	You go around, you kiss people.
3176876	3178757	Oh, man, that's going to sell really well.
3178777	3178857	What?
3178877	3180438	That's like a sexual harassment game.
3180498	3186942	It's going to sell really well amongst the nerds, because they'll need practice kissing, because they don't kiss anyone else except for their moms.
3189744	3190685	That's so wrong.
3195251	3197352	No, Tulip is a $30 game.
3198633	3197352	$29.99.
3198993	3202935	It'll be in the bargain bin in three weeks.
3203015	3203335	Come on.
3203996	3204876	You know it and I know it.
3204916	3205196	Come on.
3206957	3207318	Is that it?
3207458	3207918	That's it.
3208467	3211908	Japanese games coming out on February 15th on the PlayStation 2.
3212248	3214729	There's not a lot, actually, across the various systems.
3215329	3216849	Nothing on 360 or any of that stuff.
3216869	3220250	But we have on PlayStation 2, Appleseed EX is coming out from Sega.
3221111	3225652	They also are putting Castlevania Curse of Darkness into Konami Best Hits.
3226712	3230853	I should also mention this game, Shining Force EXA is coming out.
3231714	3233114	Also, Soul Cradle.
3233550	3236591	Sekai Okuro Mano is coming out.
3237412	3238312	Shut up, Irene.
3238352	3243194	I butcher it every... That's why they have me do the Japanese release dates, because I can't pronounce any of them.
3243294	3243735	Shut up.
3244175	3245955	I hate you.
3247876	3253079	Zero no Tsukaima is coming out as well from Marvelous Entertainment on the PlayStation 2.
3253759	3258541	Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Bleach DS Second is coming out.
3259021	3260622	And this game sounds like it might be fun.
3261058	3262599	Death Note, Kira Game.
3262759	3263119	Yes!
3263139	3264359	I want that.
3264399	3264939	It's coming out.
3265179	3266220	What the hell is Death Note?
3266240	3266600	I don't even know.
3266620	3267300	Death Note is awesome.
3267420	3267820	What is it?
3268260	3268781	It's awesome.
3269501	3270601	Okay, thanks, Jamie.
3270621	3271562	That's really descriptive.
3271582	3273042	Oh, well, fuck.
3273062	3274703	I'm going to pre-order that shit right now.
3274843	3275443	So, shut up.
3276163	3280084	Death Note is a manga done by the same one who did Hikaru no Go.
3281585	3283966	It's really, really, really, really, really, really, really cool.
3284306	3289708	They just did a movie, and they're working on a second movie, and the anime's out right now.
3290428	3290668	So, it's
3291437	3292538	It's super awesome.
3292818	3298321	It's about a guy who finds the notebook of a death god and then starts killing people.
3299962	3302223	And that's all I'm going to say because everyone should be reading it.
3302924	3310768	And if that's not your cup of tea, Luminous 2 is coming out on the PSP in Japan.
3311148	3316291	I'm not sure what songs they got different than we did, but I know they have some other songs there instead.
3316331	3317832	I think we read them on a previous episode.
3318487	3320628	So you'll have to go back and look, because I'm feeling too lazy.
3321048	3324488	But I do want to point out, also on Sony PSP, Tales of Destiny 2.
3324548	3327169	If you're a Tales of Destiny fan, there you have it.
3327729	3328189	Oh, Rob.
3328649	3330790	Domo Arigato for that news.
3330950	3331450	Shut up.
3333531	3346234	Well, actually, why don't you reserve your Domo Arigato for DarkSakura, because she is going to give you her website of the week, and it's the place on the internet that you should definitely be checking out right now.
3346274	3347154	It's not mine to give.
3347394	3348034	All right, well, we do...
3350633	3353114	It's the gift that keeps on giving here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3353134	3355315	It's someone's sick and deranged website.
3355355	3357955	Alright, well you've found it and you're highlighting it here for us.
3357975	3360356	So, arigato, DarkSakura.
3361636	3363377	He's gonna kick you, Rob.
3365217	3366978	Isn't that what Scott over on All Games calls you?
3367038	3367758	DarkSakura?
3369218	3371879	Dark... DarkBallSakura?
3373020	3373920	Hearts, love ya.
3377101	3377581	Are you done?
3377781	3378041	Yes.
3380558	3383040	DarkSakura's Hardcore Website of the Week!
3383120	3383300	Yes!
3410914	3412635	We should do that from now on.
3414015	3417437	Today's website of the week is davidtenant.com.
3417957	3424560	Dude, I want to look up the X music again.
3425040	3425680	I missed that one.
3426881	3431303	No, as I said, today's website of the week is davidtenant.com because I couldn't think of anything else.
3432063	3432723	Oh, never mind.
3432803	3433904	So much for the hardcore.
3434784	3435905	Meow, meow, meow.
3435925	3436725	Meow, meow, meow.
3437662	3439983	That would be david-tenant.com.
3440583	3443203	He is the man who plays the 10th Doctor on Doctor Who.
3444244	3445364	And I love him.
3445804	3446144	That's all.
3447004	3449825	I think we should just change this feature to Doctor Who site of the week.
3449845	3451185	Yeah, the Doctor Who website of the week.
3451225	3453766	Hey, I haven't done a Doctor Who site in like three months.
3454786	3457226	It's a bite my ass in a non-literal way.
3459947	3461547	Yes, Rice Princess has a question.
3461667	3461968	I do.
3462168	3462548	Can I help you?
3462568	3463508	Eddie wants to know.
3463628	3463788	Yes.
3464369	3469111	In any of the Link... Well, it was just, what, Ocarina of Time and... No, no.
3469311	3476573	What ended up being the only village in the land of Hyrule in the Zelda games, Irene and I pronounce it differently, and we're going to start a debate.
3476893	3480034	I pronounce it Kakariko Village, and Irene pronounces it...
3480609	3481189	Kakariko.
3481210	3482390	It would be Kakariko.
3482531	3484232	And she's Asian, so she's probably right.
3484612	3486434	Kakapoopi is what it is.
3486454	3487355	Kakapoopi Village.
3487435	3490137	All of us whiteys back in the 90s called it Kakariko Village.
3490637	3496502	Yeah, but if you read the kana, and the Japanese has pretty much even pronunciation on every syllable, it would be Kakariko.
3496903	3498424	I didn't know the village had a name.
3498724	3500766	Are you serious?
3500806	3503108	That's exactly what I was going to say.
3503168	3505790	It's a village that has the chickens that you beat up that all attack you.
3507588	3509629	I mean, it is the village.
3509649	3510790	That's what Kakariko means.
3510970	3512552	It means town of chickens.
3513912	3515193	Town of avenging chickens.
3517695	3532426	Anyway, speaking of avenging chickens, we have a brand new program that's being started by Microsoft and kind of teaming up with Old Spice Deodorant to...
3534744	3540528	Yes, the... No, I'm sorry, this is really funny, because you know that stereotype... Because any other game would be uncivilized.
3541088	3549333	No, but you know, like, the gamer that's been sitting at home all day, racking up these $10... I'm sorry, finish your story, I apologize for interrupting.
3549353	3550774	Then I'll make my deodorant joke.
3550894	3561381	They're basically challenging Xbox Live users, who are in America, to add at least 1,500 achievement points to their gamer score between February 12th and April 12th.
3562576	3569122	And depending on what your gamer score is now, starting off, that'll depend on what prize package you win.
3569202	3574587	And here are the different prize packages for you that you could possibly earn by wasting this much time.
3575648	3587698	If your gamer score is 0 to 4,999, you can earn a game picture, a dashboard theme, and Contra for Xbox Live Arcade.
3588893	3590254	Ooh, that's level 1.
3591055	3603784	Level 2, which is between 5,000 and 9,999 gamer points, you receive everything from the level 1 package, as well as 100 Microsoft points and a contest t-shirt.
3604424	3605265	Oh my god!
3605485	3606365	That's awesome!
3606445	3607546	Dude!
3607566	3608687	Dude, I love your shirt!
3608827	3609327	Dude!
3610388	3615952	Anywho, if you have over 10,000 gamer points, you will earn...
3616618	3622139	The Level 1 Package, 200 Microsoft Points, a T-Shirt, and Fusion Frenzy 2.
3623079	3623820	Oh my god!
3624240	3624960	A T-Shirt!
3625140	3625580	Dude!
3625780	3626180	Dude!
3626220	3627380	Dude, I gotta get that T-Shirt!
3627640	3629861	That game fucking sucks, but I gotta get the T-Shirt!
3630981	3640363	And by the way, we here at Orange Launch Radio are excited to announce that there's actually some secret levels that have not yet been unveiled, but here's the deal.
3640971	3653560	If you have 20,000 gamer points or more, you're in level 4 and Old Spice will actually send you free deodorant because you probably need it if your gamer score has gotten to be that high.
3653580	3656222	I'm not going to include it in every level because all of these stink.
3657163	3658784	They're like, no, no, no, we don't care about the prizes.
3658824	3661846	We really just want to get the deodorant to you and we're masking it with the prizes.
3662226	3662967	But you know what?
3662987	3665549	The best prizes in level 6, they actually send someone to punch you in the gob.
3688750	3699320	To enter this wonderful contest, just simply go to xbox.com slash rewards and you can enter after the 12th.
3701542	3706447	Hurry up and get those 1500 achievement points so you can score that wonderful Fusion Frenzy 2.
3707228	3707848	Hooray.
3708189	3713594	Travis Donovan from our Saturday night program here at Orange Lounge says, Worst product tie-in promo ever.
3714727	3725136	BlackWolf from the other Sunday Night program on the other network, AllGames.com, says Level 3 package equals 830 point value plus t-shirt plus Bill Gates' favorite game.
3725736	3727918	Oh my god, Fusion Frenzy 2 is Bill Gates' favorite game?
3728919	3729740	What a loser.
3729860	3731882	That's probably the only game he's played this year.
3732062	3734203	He's like, that's my favorite game.
3737546	3741930	Mystic Gohan says, I'm so tired of hearing, wow, you play so much, your stink is going through the mic.
3742010	3742951	Thanks, Old Spice!
3748752	3753615	Anyhow, something else that is going to cause people to not leave the house for today.
3753655	3754475	Actually, I should ask real quick.
3754495	3756437	Are you going to participate in this, Loki?
3756757	3757397	Fuck no!
3757677	3758538	Fusion Frenzy 2?
3759258	3761059	Well, but you're not at that level.
3761199	3762260	Your gamer score is not 10,000.
3762380	3765462	I know, free t-shirt.
3767182	3770544	I'm going to be playing Crackdown, so if I finish Crackdown that quick, I guess.
3770724	3772265	DDR Universe is going to be an easy 1,000 points.
3772305	3772425	Anyhow...
3775768	3776949	The Halo 3 Beta Invite
3798206	3805789	Halo 3 Beta invites the picture that are included with Crackdown, like the little slip that comes in has been leaked out to the internet.
3806129	3808030	And here's the catch about the Halo 3 Beta.
3808350	3812571	You have to have the Crackdown disc to be able to play the Halo 3 Beta.
3812911	3816573	So no buying the game, taking the slip out for the Halo 3 thing, and then selling the game back.
3816593	3823555	You actually have to hang on to the game, probably past the return window, to actually play the Halo 3 Beta online.
3823775	3824936	And just another thing, too.
3825683	3830264	The Halo 3 beta might not be available right as you pick up Crackdown.
3830844	3832665	No, I hope nobody's expecting that.
3832725	3833485	It's not going to be.
3833545	3835125	I hope people don't think that's what's going to happen.
3836886	3840507	It just means that you're going to get into the beta whenever it's available.
3840647	3849129	Is that like a subtle way for them to let people know that they're cracking down on that returning...
3851926	3853227	Say goodbye to Rice Princess, everyone.
3853267	3853927	It's the last show.
3854247	3855588	It's nice knowing you, Rice Princess.
3855608	3856209	Thanks for playing.
3856669	3857029	You lose.
3857409	3857650	Failed.
3859010	3868236	Well, in other gaming news, there is a particular little game that a lot of people were sort of obsessed of that didn't go so well in Japan called LocoRoco.
3868896	3871158	Well, the sequel is now playable.
3871838	3879843	You can go actually onto the website and there is a downloadable version available.
3882657	3883457	Did you download it?
3883677	3884037	Not yet.
3884097	3884557	Are you going to?
3884577	3885738	Because I haven't been home.
3886078	3886478	I see.
3887258	3888738	She got her hair did this weekend.
3888758	3889398	I got my hair did.
3889478	3889738	Yeah.
3890738	3911982	Now, there also is, though, a little bit of a rumor stating that it could be possible this will be a PS3 version, but honestly, I'm really thinking that it should just stay PSP, because that type of game really lends itself well to the PSP, especially, you know, since you're turning the six success, you know, is not going to be as much fun as
3912608	3913308	The system itself.
3914109	3915029	Rocking the system itself.
3916850	3918851	Yeah, I'm hoping it'll go on PSP as well.
3918871	3925754	Because PSP, you know, actually PSP's having a little bit of a resurgence with the Castlevania and some of these other games that are coming out.
3925834	3929656	It's in Portable Ops and all these Konami's support behind PSP.
3930096	3934718	It's actually becoming more and more like a system people ought to be checking out.
3934818	3936299	Especially if a price cut is in the future.
3936339	3937059	I bought another PSP.
3937260	3937500	Did you?
3937800	3938120	Yeah.
3938160	3938500	Good job.
3938800	3939681	I bought it off of a friend.
3939701	3940161	What's this, your 4th?
3941939	3943401	Well, I only have two now.
3944521	3944762	Only?
3945322	3945522	Yeah.
3945782	3951087	Well, basically, this one is going to be... I'm going to put the Dark Alex firmware on there now.
3951767	3959513	And it's because my friend, he mistreats his PSP, so he broke the buttons and the analog sticks, so I have to fix that.
3960094	3961395	But I bought it for three bucks.
3961715	3965999	By the way, if you're listening to us on a PSP, you should visit olrpsp.com.
3966741	3969162	Loki hasn't updated it in about a year, but it's still pretty.
3969362	3970483	And there's a background that you can download.
3970503	3971944	There will be new stuff eventually.
3971984	3972664	Sure, there will.
3972804	3973485	And I'm working on stuff.
3973525	3975826	Right after you finish the Wii website, too, right?
3976166	3979768	Actually, that has to do with the PSP.
3980008	3980869	Oh, really?
3983270	3984131	Wow, that's lame.
3984991	3985371	Anyways.
3985391	3986952	This is better than OPSP, really.
3986992	3992195	So, well, some cool stuff, though, that you might be able to do in the future will include Skype.
3992555	3993516	Because apparently...
3994873	4008523	Speaking of the new firmwares coming out, they have dissected the firmware and they have found a little line of code here in 3.11 that says, it talks about the Skype plugin.
4009303	4014827	So it's something that will be coming out possibly later on, but that's kind of cool though.
4015067	4018009	So Skype support coming soon to your PSP.
4020391	4021031	How's that going to work?
4021071	4023353	Because there's no microphone on it.
4024351	4025512	Well, they have headsets for it.
4025572	4029836	You can use headsets for... Whatever happened to the DS thing that was like Skype?
4029876	4031377	Remember when they showed that at E3?
4031677	4033839	Like they had the Wi-Fi voice thing?
4033859	4034879	Voice over IP?
4035020	4037642	Just like they have in Metroid Prime Hunter?
4037682	4038923	Oh, they put it in one game.
4038983	4039843	Big wow.
4039983	4044007	Actually, no, they have it in the new Diddy Kong Racing.
4044047	4045268	I think you're missing my point.
4045348	4050452	My point is where is the standalone app where I can use this to call my friends across the U.S.
4050492	4050852	for free?
4051849	4056194	Rob, now if they had a standalone app, that would mean that they're embracing online.
4057035	4060879	They don't want to let everyone know that they're embracing online.
4060959	4061660	It's a secret.
4061800	4063963	Oh, because they haven't actually embraced online.
4064864	4067627	They're actually making the internet harder, is what Nintendo does.
4067647	4068367	You don't understand, Rob.
4068488	4069108	You don't understand.
4069309	4069989	We connect 24.
4070210	4071411	It's connected all the time.
4071471	4073053	That means it's connected to...
4074108	4075129	Something out there.
4075749	4077650	Something that makes my Wii glow.
4077890	4081152	But when I turn it on to see what that something is, there's nothing there.
4081412	4084373	But shortly after I turn it on, there's stuff there.
4084894	4087835	It's just it lets me know soon there will be more stuff there.
4088075	4090716	Wake me up when the Wii downloads my porn for me.
4091217	4095959	What the fuck is... Seriously, and I hate to go on a rant about it again, but what the fuck is up with Wii Connect 24?
4096179	4097320	It doesn't download my messages.
4097360	4098881	I don't have current weather.
4099141	4100421	I don't have current news.
4100982	4102402	It doesn't download any updates.
4102422	4103523	What the fuck is it doing?
4104272	4105273	Is your Wii on?
4106793	4108334	Yes, my Wii is on.
4109214	4112676	No, it's devil power making it glow.
4112876	4115938	You should be a Nintendo customer service rep.
4116258	4117859	I've had the total opposite experience.
4117899	4120600	My Wii starts glowing, I turn it on, and there's messages right there.
4120740	4123981	All the updates are downloaded without me having to do anything, so I don't know what you're doing.
4125502	4129024	No, but don't you have to click in and actually do the update manually?
4129424	4129644	What? !
4133174	4134315	I've never had to do that.
4135135	4137317	Do you have the news channel on your Wii right now?
4138097	4138337	I do.
4138577	4142600	Yeah, when there's a new server, because they're not just going to do that without you wanting to do it.
4142900	4147743	But the messages are there, the updates of like, yeah, it'll tell you right away.
4148604	4152846	That was the thing, is that Wii Connect 24 is supposed to do all that shit without you having to think about it, right?
4153587	4156489	Not the extra apps, though, because you have to choose what apps you want.
4156549	4159711	Like, I'd be kind of mad if I won, and I was like, I don't want that app, and it was on there, you know?
4159911	4161612	But like, the messages, I don't have to download them.
4162005	4163085	They're already there when I turn it on.
4185131	4186432	What if you don't want the internet browser?
4186452	4187113	Too bad!
4187193	4188634	Then don't download it!
4188854	4190795	The internet browser you don't have to download.
4190915	4191976	It's news and weather.
4192376	4193577	You need your news and weather.
4194598	4196619	Oh yeah, I really need that really bad.
4197460	4200522	I would like to take a quick poll of all the Wii owners in the room.
4200982	4205946	How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?
4206086	4208067	How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?
4208368	4209048	I will go first.
4209488	4213091	I've used the forecast channel twice and the news channel three times.
4214082	4217084	And once was this week because I was looking for pictures of Anna Nicole Smith.
4218124	4218425	Loki.
4219105	4227690	I used the forecast channel once today, but it had weather from midnight, which said it was still raining, yet outside it's blurring sun, so apparently that was wrong.
4228691	4232053	And Loki went outside in a huge parka going, Man, fuck the week!
4233356	4233836	Thanks for watching!
4249640	4252882	DarkSakura, how many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?
4252902	4254102	She's holding up a big fat zero.
4254162	4254482	Eddie?
4281088	4282330	One time, when I first got it.
4282550	4285074	Dan just used it, though.
4285134	4285675	Like, every day?
4286336	4289060	I just happened to be in the living room and he had it up while I was leaving.
4289080	4289520	Okay, so once.
4290281	4292785	More than that, but I saw it once.
4293166	4296731	I haven't used either before, but I use the Foreskin channel a lot.
4297768	4298289	DarkSakura.com
4315188	4319432	The PSP and the PS3 networks will be joining together.
4320132	4321854	That was coming from Phil Harrison.
4321934	4326558	Quote, this year we'll be adding some functionality to the PSP that will unify our approach.
4327159	4330421	So we really don't know what exactly that means yet.
4330461	4334205	That means I don't have to buy a PlayStation 3 to download PlayStation 1 games to my PSP.
4335323	4341185	If maybe that means that they'll have the same look and feel of the store or what's going on, but we don't really know.
4341425	4348068	That means that the PlayStation Portable will actually have a network store, since it doesn't right now.
4348868	4352790	That would be kind of nice, because the Sony website isn't even that great on the PSP.
4352810	4353550	I don't know if you've gone to it.
4353570	4354210	It's not that great.
4354891	4358492	I try not to go to it, because it's lame.
4358512	4358612	Lame.
4363015	4367219	I'm reading comments in chat room, by the way, who's giving some feedback on the whole debate we were having in here.
4367860	4370302	James Patrick says, Forecast is good here in Texas.
4370363	4371784	It told me it was going to rain a couple times.
4373025	4373366	Interesting.
4374787	4376609	Bershaz says, Wait, we are gamers.
4376689	4377550	We are in the basement.
4377630	4378191	No windows.
4378691	4379432	Oh, I forgot.
4379712	4380193	Sorry about that.
4380693	4381554	How could I forget?
4381714	4383176	Oh, yeah, because we're on the second story.
4385018	4385298	Anyhow.
4386079	4386299	Well.
4388742	4397547	I actually read an article last week about an HMV UK retailer who was doing a PSP, PS3 bundle.
4397707	4403530	They have retracted it now due to consumer pissed-offness.
4404531	4406392	They've heard the people... Is that the legal term?
4406572	4407592	Yes, pissed-offness.
4408213	4409413	They have heard the people.
4409593	4413956	They have gone back and said that for anyone who's participated in the pre-order...
4414488	4416389	They did this in response to customer demand.
4444602	4445703	PMS of the Masses
4468717	4469797	Which is kind of interesting.
4469837	4477020	You tilt the screen around, moving the mother duck to collect the baby ducks and reach the end.
4478080	4481541	Yeah, that will be coming sometime soon, I guess.
4483882	4493525	And then, of course, they were talking about SingStar for the PlayStation 3 and how the PlayStation Store will be supporting that as well.
4495506	4497867	So, no, that's not a big surprise.
4498237	4506003	And of course, you know, also talking about how people will be able to create their own custom user pages, including video performances of them singing.
4507304	4511607	I assume that you would need the eye toy for this, or the eye of judgment, or whatever, you know.
4513608	4517411	And then, of course, they were talking about Will Simon Cowell be a part of the eye of judgment?
4517712	4518672	I thought it was awful.
4519573	4520253	No, they will not.
4520293	4522195	I think you should take a gun and shoot yourself in the face.
4523513	4528655	And then finally, the PlayStation 3 online platform will continue to evolve aggressively.
4528895	4535697	Well, that's great, because one game, or less than one game a month, kind of sucks right now with your PlayStation online store.
4535957	4539718	I know people bitch about no updates to the Xbox 360's market, but geez.
4540198	4545000	Yeah, at least Xbox 360's getting stuff, you know, on a weekly basis at least.
4545626	4549808	I have yet to see some new demos come to the PlayStation 3 store.
4550088	4551909	But it's early, I mean, for PlayStation.
4551929	4554070	I mean, Xbox was slow in the beginning as well.
4554090	4556391	Yeah, I remember that, but still, though, I mean, come on.
4557872	4558952	I don't want to see an update.
4559152	4560593	Oh, there's new stuff on the PlayStation store.
4560733	4563334	It's a new PS1 game that you can't play on the PS3.
4563654	4564915	You need to play it on your PSP.
4565135	4565695	Well, fuck you.
4566555	4569337	Raven's Dolphin says, Loki, I think the duck is a joke I do not know.
4569377	4570037	What's the duck joke?
4570990	4574813	The duck they showed at every new console launch.
4574853	4576475	It's like the tech demo that they had.
4577876	4578816	Oh, the rubber duckie.
4578837	4582880	The way they filled the tub with the rubber ducks to do how many on-screen polygons.
4583801	4588364	That was on the very first disc, the PS position demo disc.
4590286	4599153	Well, speaking of PlayStation, at least the portable types, they're going to get you in trouble in New York City pretty soon, but don't worry, Sony fanboys, Nintendo DS is a fair game as well.
4599393	4600014	This is the reason
4600424	4601585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4617327	4618708	It's legislation.
4618728	4620410	It hasn't been passed yet, but it's on the table.
4621872	4630380	You could be charged a $100 fine if you're using a PSP, a Nintendo DS, an iPod, a Blackberry, or a mobile phone all while crossing the road.
4630921	4632082	Really?
4632102	4633443	I think it's interesting.
4633563	4636526	Dangerous to use a device and walk?
4636787	4638028	What about people driving?
4639501	4640563	Oh, it's dangerous, too!
4640663	4641404	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4641424	4642806	It is illegal there, too, isn't it?
4643067	4647253	But, well, yeah, I mean, that's already illegal in New York City, but you have to remember... It's illegal here, too, Rob.
4647313	4649436	Keep in mind... Well, not yet, but it almost is.
4649456	4649757	Uh-huh.
4649977	4653382	But keep this in mind, is that... I switched to speakerphone anyway.
4653482	4654164	Back off, lady!
4655891	4656291	DarkSakura.com
4678576	4682940	Who the fuck can play a game and walk in the first place is what I want to know, but, you know, whatever.
4683180	4683740	So they're doing it.
4683820	4688264	Some of our New York City living friends chime in on this in the chat.
4688324	4691206	Ranma says, Sky, some people are too stupid to pay attention.
4691546	4694889	You do not turn the volume up to the point where you cannot hear a honking horn.
4695509	4698792	Legend of Zaku says, looks like this guy hasn't heard about natural selection.
4699853	4700634	Amen to that.
4700994	4702255	What do you guys think about this law?
4702695	4704156	Is this a needed law?
4704477	4705037	A necessity?
4706999	4707479	I think...
4708127	4712128	That Darwinism should just be let work because that would cleanse the gene pool.
4713188	4713429	Wow.
4714209	4714509	Alright.
4716269	4720050	I think we have to blame Grand Theft Auto for this because in Grand Theft Auto you run over people.
4720110	4724572	So therefore, Grand Theft Auto is to blame because these people are getting run over by cars.
4724972	4726052	It makes perfect sense.
4726312	4728913	Where is the justice with these damn M-rated games?
4729213	4734514	We need to take them off the shelves because clearly it's not incompetent people that are causing deaths.
4735215	4736555	It is these M-rated games.
4738226	4739827	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4768064	4769365	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4791616	4792196	Thank you for watching!
4812409	4818152	I was thinking they shouldn't pass that so that people can still be getting hit by cars while they're doing that.
4818513	4822095	And then I can just run over and take their PSP while they're on the ground, dying.
4822495	4824116	And I'm like, yes, I have a PSP now.
4824136	4825076	Oh, you're so sympathetic.
4825096	4825357	I know.
4826057	4826898	I would totally do that.
4827078	4827838	Yeah, me too.
4827898	4828799	It's like, you're stupid.
4828839	4829939	You don't deserve one of these.
4830019	4832441	Well, I sense the angst rising in this room.
4832481	4834442	And you know what happens when the angst rises?
4835202	4836123	People die.
4845620	4849223	It's time for the FUs of the week here, boys and girls.
4849323	4851185	I love the FUs of the week.
4851225	4853667	DarkSakura, then start us off.
4854107	4862514	A big FU to the medical industry for being more interested in selling us drugs than actually fixing the problem.
4867978	4877146	Because they give you all these drugs that do nothing but, you know, treat the symptoms or suppress the symptoms that your body, you know, creates to help you heal.
4877927	4881070	And making us more and more and more and more and more dependent on them.
4881530	4887856	When I think, you know, it's one thing that if you, like, say, have, like, diabetes and need insulin.
4887876	4888577	That's one thing.
4888737	4890719	That's chronic condition.
4891199	4894202	But, like, if you have the flu...
4895205	4922798	And think, oh my god, I need to take this drug and this drug and this drug and this drug When all you have to do is drink some tea, take some vitamin C, and take some time off work and sleep You don't need to pay the whole reason that the medical field is so fucked up right now Is because people are too dependent on treating symptoms I've learned so much since going into massage therapy about how the body works
4923604	4927266	And also, if you're stressed out, take some fucking time and breathe.
4928107	4930849	You're dumping adrenaline and other toxins into your liver.
4930889	4932550	You are making yourself fucking sick.
4933070	4934511	Just stop and breathe.
4936772	4937072	I'm done.
4937833	4938233	Loki.
4939294	4940194	Shut up, Firebomba.
4940294	4940795	Fuck you.
4941435	4942456	I don't give happy endings.
4942596	4947099	See, if you want to join our chatroom, you too can get yelled at by DarkSakura.
4947159	4952622	I'd like to make a nephew to the Highway Patrol in California.
4952642	4952722	Okay.
4953258	4955339	I'm not very angry today.
4955920	4956000	Oh.
4982069	4991696	Fuck Activision for suing people over Guitar Hero, the completely original guitar game out there.
4991896	5001302	My FU of the week goes to my doctor for not being available when I need her, and to the dentist for my temporary crown falling out a second time.
5001462	5002323	That's just lovely.
5003924	5005225	RicePrincess, do you have any FUs?
5005305	5006666	Any angst you'd like to get off your chest?
5007025	5012689	Yeah, I wanted to say F you too because you're playing this version of One Man Angel when you should be playing the piano version.
5013290	5013830	Hello.
5013870	5014851	Jamie's choice, not mine.
5014951	5015392	Oh, okay.
5015432	5017213	Well, you can play that one.
5017733	5020516	Yeah, so it would be an honor if Amy and I remember that one.
5020716	5022497	I do, but nobody else does.
5022637	5023698	Yeah, that's okay.
5023758	5027141	Well, then we can refresh their memories by reenacting it on their own.
5027181	5028162	I think I deleted that MP3.
5028202	5029703	I think I'm going to punch you.
5030363	5031144	Uh, Eddie.
5031484	5031784	Eddie.
5031865	5033366	Any F yous of the week you want to give?
5033626	5036068	Yeah, I'm F youing Whiney
5036616	5039038	Immature Stray Girls was the only guys for me, so ha!
5039058	5041741	Me too.
5042061	5045584	Well... Stupid Stray Girls.
5045624	5046225	Look out!
5049328	5051209	That was a good comeback, right?
5051309	5052070	Look out!
5052911	5054452	You need a third eye for that.
5056214	5057595	Nobody understands that.
5057615	5058336	Nobody on the internet.
5058356	5060317	I know, I know, because no one listens to the Wednesday show.
5060357	5060498	Jerk.
5061252	5064394	Anyhow, I think now's a very good time to take a break.
5064434	5066515	I don't know about you kids, but I think now's a good break time.
5067035	5068315	So we're going to take a break right now.
5068355	5070957	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
