0	26360	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 219 for this February the 11th of 2007.
26360	31200	If you're downloading this on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, welcome to the program.
31200	38360	Keep in mind we tape this live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
38360	43400	You can hear the show rebroadcast in its entirety before it hits the podcast stream at allgames.com
43400	48800	Monday nights at 530 Pacific and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m. Pacific, or you can just wait until
48800	53080	Wednesday or Thursday-ish when the show Part B makes it to the audio archive, whatever
53080	54080	works for you.
54080	57480	See, Orange Lounge Radio, we have multiple ways to get you the show that you've come
57480	61360	to listen to, and we thank you for tuning into and supporting our program.
61360	64440	You supporting independent radio are a real winner.
64440	68480	Rob, where's the tape recorder that you're taping the show on?
68480	69480	It's all in my brain.
69480	70480	In the 80s?
70480	72800	Back in the day, I used scripts for all this stuff.
72800	73800	I don't even use them.
73800	74800	It's all in my brain.
74800	78880	I think your tape recorder is in the 80s where it belongs.
78880	82000	By the way, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, it is a little bit
82000	84540	of an off night tonight, and I blame our guests.
84540	89280	But Dark Soccer is going to rescue us with some gaming news.
89280	90280	I don't want to.
90280	91280	You must.
91280	92280	Help.
92280	93280	You're our only help.
93280	94280	Okay, how about this?
94280	95280	It's movie news.
95280	96280	That works.
96280	98520	As long as it's not Uwe Boll.
98520	99520	Shut up!
99520	103280	Yes, it's going to be one of those shows tonight.
103280	104280	Rob.
104280	105280	What?
105280	106280	Rob.
106280	107280	What?
107280	108280	Rob.
108280	109280	I quit.
109280	110280	Okay, so Sony.
110280	112280	Good, my show now.
112280	115760	Hi, you're listening to Jamie Lounge Radio.
115760	116760	No.
116760	117920	Did you hear that?
117920	119560	That's the sound of a thousand people unsubscribing.
119560	120560	There you go.
120560	121560	You know what?
121560	123880	That's the sound of my finger raised in tribute to you.
123880	124880	Video game news.
124880	125880	Do we ever do it on this program?
125880	133360	Sony is making a Metal Gear movie produced by, was it the one who's producing the Ghost
133360	135580	Rider movie?
135580	137280	That is very cool stuff.
137280	148240	It was actually announced by Studio Kojima at last E3 and basically as far as what's
148240	159200	been quoted is that it's going to be a very, okay, this makes no sense.
159200	167760	They're talking about a cinematic game, but they were talking about a movie.
167760	168760	I don't get it.
168760	172000	Well, because Metal Gear Solid is a very cinematic game.
172000	174600	So basically they're saying because it's a cinematic.
174600	175800	Oh, I misread it.
175800	176800	That was me.
176800	180640	Yeah, because it's a very cinematic game, it lends itself to a movie very simply.
180640	181640	Very well.
181640	182640	Yeah.
182640	183640	Yeah.
183640	186600	I completely, apparently I forgot how to read in my weekend area.
186600	189320	That's why we're only, you know, that's why we're amateur radio.
189320	191200	That's why we don't get paid for this.
191200	192200	Whatever.
192200	194360	Don't make me feel worse.
194360	195360	Anyway.
195360	199800	But yeah, I'm actually voting for the ride in sequel.
199800	201800	The ride in sequel?
201800	202800	Yeah.
202800	203800	What?
203800	204800	UFO ending?
204800	205800	What?
205800	206800	No.
206800	207800	Dog ending?
207800	208800	No.
208800	211800	That's the Silent Helmet movie, not Metal Gear.
211800	218640	So does that mean we're going to speculate about who's going to be playing all of the
218640	221520	roles in the movie?
221520	225800	Well garsh, Rice Princess, if you were to cast the Metal Gear Solid movie, who would
225800	229200	you cast in the role of Snake?
229200	231200	A snake?
231200	236520	No, I would cast, why can I not?
236520	238960	Matt Damon, because he plays everybody.
238960	239960	Or Ben Affleck.
239960	240960	Matt Damon.
240960	241960	Ben Affleck.
241960	242960	Ben Affleck.
242960	247480	Because apparently people think that he's such a universal actor that he can play any
247480	248480	role ever.
248480	251960	No, I know, I know who I want it to be.
251960	253960	The guy who's his voice actor.
253960	254960	David Tennant?
254960	255960	No, David Hayter.
255960	256960	Ah.
256960	262360	Yeah, okay, I'm pulling up pictures of him and he's actually really cute and he would
262360	264040	actually make a good snake.
264040	266580	See here he is.
266580	269620	As long as Loki plays- I'm going to send it to the chat room.
269620	272500	As long as Loki plays the role of Tingle.
272500	273500	That's according to GS68.
273500	279880	Well no, because keep in mind, David Hayter, actually David Hayter wrote the first two
279880	285040	X-Men movies, but he was also Solid Snake's voice actor, plus he's pretty freaking, he
285040	286600	looks kind of like Snake too.
286600	288140	DJ Jenai wins.
288140	291440	He says Paul Reubens should play Snake.
291440	296800	Yeah, apparently it's the Hollywood Reporter saying that Columbia Pictures is now currently
296800	303360	negotiating the rights to mill your solid- Columbia is owned by Sony, so not a big surprise
303360	304360	there.
304360	311320	Anyways, what is kind of a big surprise though is Rockstar's brand new game, Manhunt 2, is
311320	315080	coming to the Wii as well as Playstation 2 and PSP.
315080	321000	For those who didn't play Manhunt 1, in Manhunt you actually play a psychopathic killer who
321000	329480	has basically egged on to kill people in very violent ways, using everything from trash
329480	338280	bags to shards of glass, and well, I guess we will actually get a murder simulator, which
338280	340120	is awesome, and it's going to be very violent.
340120	342640	Wait, so you can use a trash bag to kill someone?
342640	346720	Yes, and it's great because you can use- Let's demonstrate in studio how that's done.
346720	349600	Irene, if you would just sit still for a minute.
349600	356860	Just kidding, we here at Orange Laundry do not endorse the actual killing of actual people.
356860	364360	And then of course this got announced on February 6th, which just so happened, ironically enough,
364360	370880	and I'm sure this is just pure coincidence, happened to be the anniversary of apparently
370880	379660	a murder that was sought to be blamed on the original Manhunt game apparently.
379660	389800	There was a 2004 incident where a kid, Steven Pacara, age 14, was murdered by his friend
389800	396320	Warren LeBlanc, age 17, and of course they blamed the actions on the game, which was
396320	401560	later disproved in court, but parents either way are still kind of pissed off that they
401560	404400	made this announcement on the anniversary of that.
404400	405400	Hooray!
405400	407040	More murder games!
407040	409360	I love this, and fuck those parents.
409360	412240	Those parents are just jealous that they didn't think of it first.
412240	413840	So you know what?
413840	415880	Manhunt 2, hell yes.
415880	416880	Wow.
416880	420600	I apologize if I mispronounce this name.
420600	428640	Kai Hate Wireless says, Manhunt 2 will get Wii recalls at Walmarts and Targets nationwide.
428640	431760	Mike W says, murder games suck.
431760	433560	Raven's Dolphin says, Manhunt for the Wii.
433560	437040	For the win, FTW.
437040	439400	Well, we shall see.
439400	442320	Is Manhunt 2 a game that interests you?
442320	445040	Dark Soccer, because you said earlier in the program you want games with more blood and
445040	448560	more violence, and I don't know, killing people with a trash bag with your Wii mote.
448560	453880	I think that that would be a very interesting place to time.
453880	457760	I think that it should be Ultimate PMS Revenge, the game.
457760	458760	Alright.
458760	462600	She just doesn't like the title because it has man in it.
462600	466760	Well, no, because that could also be women taking revenge off of male oppression.
466760	468240	What if they called it Man Cunt?
468240	469640	Would that appeal to you then?
469640	473080	No, because then I'd start thinking of someone who's pre-op transgendered or something.
473080	477080	Oh, god, I just threw up in my mouth.
477080	484120	Let's switch topics to a Zorro game on the way to the Wii.
484120	490440	Pronto Games is going to be bringing the destiny of Zorro to the Wii this holiday season.
490440	493040	This was announced by Pronto Games.
493040	498320	Pronto President and Creative Director Randy Angle said they hope to bring the player,
498320	501320	quote, fully into the moment of Zoroness.
501320	503400	This game is currently planned as a Wii exclusive.
503400	504400	You know what that is?
504400	506280	I swear to god, that's a quote.
506280	507280	Fully into the moment of Zoroness.
507280	508780	Ron, you have killed Irene.
508780	509940	She is laughing to death.
509940	510940	That's what it says.
510940	513400	What would that be, like the 1920s?
513400	519960	You all know that with that wiimote, you're going to have to do that stupid make a Z with
519960	521000	your wiimote.
521000	526240	How many times in the game do you think you're going to be required to go with a wiimote?
526240	527760	I think that's the only point of the game.
527760	528760	That's what you do.
528760	532080	The objective is you try to make the Z.
532080	533080	That's the game.
533080	537600	That's how you fully embrace the Zoroness, is pfft, pfft, pfft.
537600	545120	Yeah, and at the same time, you can fully embrace the Zoroness for buying the game.
545120	547600	You know, they call him the gay blade.
547600	549760	Oh, really?
549760	553360	DJ, it's a new Zor...
553360	554360	Whatever.
554360	561480	DJ Jenai says, Zo, really?
561480	565320	It's like this, Rob, it's just, it's like...
565320	567360	Three snaps in Z formation?
567360	569920	Did Loki just do three snaps in Z formation?
569920	571560	I think that he did.
571560	572560	Slash, slash, slash.
572560	573560	What's going on?
573560	580140	I give this game two snaps, a twist, and a kiss.
580140	581440	I would not be buying this game.
581440	585360	This is the single gayest show we've ever done.
585360	586360	By the way, if...
586360	589000	It's so gay that they'll be downloading rainbows.
589000	596560	By the way, if you are listening for the first time, and you're like, that's wrong, I'm gonna
596560	597960	call GLAAD on these people.
597960	601440	Two of us are gay, so it's okay that we make these jokes.
601440	603400	Me being one of them, Eddie the Gay being the other.
603400	604400	So just...
604400	608120	Casper the Gay, Eddie the Gay, whatever, you're gay.
608120	609120	Gay the Gay.
609120	613360	Gay the gayest gay that ever gayed with his gay blade on the Zorro gay game.
613360	614360	I can really...
614360	615360	DT said I just won the internet.
615360	616360	Except for Rob.
616360	621800	Dude, when I ever eat breakfast, I poop out the internet, so don't worry about that.
621800	625680	Have you mastered your gay blade, Eddie?
625680	629160	Rob has the gay blade, and he bought it at Disneyland.
629160	632040	Let's go back to video game news, shall we?
632040	633040	Before we lose.
633040	637160	Tonight, it's how many subscribers can we lose?
637160	640160	Speaking of gay, I'm sorry.
640160	641160	Transformers.
641160	643200	How about some news about Transformers?
643200	648280	There's a Transformers game being put out by Activision on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PS2,
648280	649280	and PC.
649280	654720	That's a lot of P's trying to say that five times fast.
654720	662120	We have the PSP and DS versions that are going to be handled by Savage and Vicarious Visions.
662120	664200	Wait, they're going to be handled by a Savage?
664200	667880	The Transformers are being handled, you know.
667880	674280	I figured if we could have a transforming tape deck, we could have a vibrator.
674280	677280	And that will get me to another topic today, because I actually looked at the Transformers
677280	679480	movie poster today and about cried.
679480	683120	Yeah, it's actually being handled by Randy Macho Man Savage.
683120	684120	Oh, yeah!
684120	686120	Snap into a Transformer!
686120	688800	That was awful!
688800	691920	I love that he plays Space Ghost Grandpa.
691920	692920	Oh, yeah!
692920	694920	On Space Ghost Ghost to Ghost.
694920	698560	I will actually be doing the rest of the night as Randy Macho Man Savage.
698560	699560	Oh, yeah!
699560	701560	You can't know, Rob.
701560	702560	Oh, no!
702560	703560	Oh, no!
703560	704560	Naughty, naughty, Kool-Aid!
704560	707640	So when are you going to start, Rob?
707640	709640	Because that's awful.
709640	713600	So how about that Transformers game, huh?
713600	714600	Sure.
714600	719800	The Transformers game, you'll be able to either play as an Autobot or Decepticon, and you
719800	725880	would have to master each character's weapon, moves, transformations, and you'd have to
725880	730520	be able to switch between the, of course, vehicle and robot mode.
730520	734920	You can tear up the world around you, you can smash shit, and you can blow shit up.
734920	737320	And that makes it an awesome game already.
737320	738320	Woo-hoo!
738320	746720	Traveler's Tales, by the way, I believe that they are the ones releasing it.
746720	751260	They also had that Lego Star Wars game.
751260	753680	And also had that stupid Bionicle game, as well.
753680	755200	But the Lego Star Wars game was fun.
755200	757200	Perhaps Lego Transformers?
757200	758200	No?
758200	765960	I don't know, but I freaking saw that poster today and wanted to cry again, but I am going
765960	767960	to see Ghostwriter.
767960	778040	Anyways, so the PSP, they just updated the firmware from 3.10 to 3.11, adding brand new
778040	786080	functionality like a fix to some of the R-Type games and a reset button for the emulator.
786080	792340	And well, as you might have guessed, as soon as they got it released out there to the world,
792340	797980	it was cracked and broken apart, and yeah, yet another firmware that's been released
797980	801240	by Sony and cracked the same day.
801240	807400	So hooray, your attempts at foiling homebrew have failed yet again.
807400	809200	I don't even care.
809200	811960	Did you say that this is version 3.1.1?
811960	812960	3.1.1.
812960	829920	Someone cracked our system, down, down, they took it down, down, down, down, sorry.
829920	836940	You know what, it's one of those shows, this is 3.1.1, the last three reviews that we've
836940	838900	had on the station.
838900	844000	This is the show we're submitting to the Podcast Emmys, by the way, just so you know.
844000	852080	Vote for us on Digg and Podcast Allie, and tell them you loved episode 219.
852080	860400	Anyhow, Will Wheaton, who can save a show, but who doesn't love Will Wheaton?
860400	862640	Oh my God, Will Wheaton is awesome.
862640	868440	Will Wheaton blogged this week on suicidegirls.com, and he was blogging about the arcades.
868440	872680	I urge you to check this out, it was one of those reminiscing posts, he's talking about
872680	877280	how he loves the arcades, and he loved the arcades back in the 80s, and he asked himself,
877280	879320	what happens to the arcades?
879320	883380	And he talks about, well, he thinks that because of PC gaming, and now he can spend 40 bucks
883380	886280	to play a game at home, why would you spend a dollar on a game now?
886280	890760	But what I thought was most interesting about this is his perspective on what should they
890760	891760	do?
891760	896240	And he thought in the last paragraph of his statement here, he thinks that some billionaire
896240	902120	should come out and open a chain of classic 1980 videos arcades, complete with the Journey
902120	907840	game and Rush on the Jukebox, more reasons why I love Will Wheaton, by the way, love
907840	913480	him, and that you get five tokens for a dollar, and he says, why not?
913480	919000	You had a resurgence of 50s diners in the 80s, so why not a resurgence of classic 80s
919000	920160	arcades in the new millennium?
920160	921160	What do you think?
921160	925360	If they opened up a classic 80s arcade, would you go and would you patronize it?
925360	928000	Yeah, or I could play MAME in my garage.
928000	932280	Well, if they had the Journey game, I wouldn't.
932280	934120	I would be camped out in front of the machine all day.
934120	935120	I would have the high score.
935120	937480	No, the Journey game is awesome.
937480	938600	The Journey game is awesome.
938600	940020	But you know what?
940020	943160	You know where you get to play that is a classic gaming expo?
943160	945080	They need to have like food there too, though.
945080	947720	It would have to be like old school Chuck E. Cheese, you know, back there.
947720	950280	Isn't that kind of what Dave & Buster's is, though?
950280	951280	Sort of, yeah.
951280	952280	Yeah.
952280	953480	But Dave & Buster's is way damn expensive.
953480	957040	I mean, they have just way too many ticket games there that cost way too much to win
957040	962000	prizes that are, you know, okay, more expensive, but still, they have to spend more money.
962000	963000	So I don't know.
963000	964000	Hold on.
964000	966160	I have to set the mood here a little bit.
966160	976280	Oh, yeah, this shit takes me back to the days of Asteroids and Ms. Pac-Man.
976280	980640	Can you imagine walking into an arcade and you got Journey blasting on the...
980640	984800	Man, this takes me back.
984800	985800	You love this song.
985800	986800	You know it.
986800	990200	You just don't want to admit it, right, Princess?
990200	994120	Anyhow, well, we've welcomed Wil Wheaton's opinion onto the program.
994120	995400	How about your opinion?
995400	1000740	You guys send us emails every week to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and last week we
1000740	1004360	complained we didn't get enough emails, so I think we actually got quite a few more emails
1004360	1007060	this week, so we're very proud of the listeners.
1007060	1009880	We hope we get more next week, so mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
1009880	1011080	You hope we get more.
1011080	1015880	Let's get Dark Sakura to open up the mailbag and read some emails.
1015880	1025080	Email, email, email, checking the email.
1025080	1029360	First one comes from Apollo-chan saying, hey there, Dark Sakura.
1029360	1030360	Oh, it's to me.
1030360	1031360	Wow.
1031360	1033360	I hope all is well with you and the rest of the crew.
1033360	1037280	I was just curious if you or any of the other members of the OLR crew happen to have a Facebook
1037280	1038480	account.
1038480	1042420	If you are not familiar with Facebook, think MySpace, except less tacky and more respectable
1042420	1043420	atmosphere.
1043420	1047560	It began as a university-only networking site, but now it's open to everyone.
1047560	1051280	If you all are not members, I would like to suggest that you at least give it a look.
1051280	1055720	Also, there's an OLR Facebook group called Orange Dodge Radio Fans, the OLR me, that
1055720	1059120	I started a while ago, and I just thought it might be good to let you all know in case
1059120	1060240	you weren't aware.
1060240	1061920	That way, you could better promote it.
1061920	1064120	Just another vessel for spreading the OLR gospel.
1064120	1065940	Love, love, love the show.
1065940	1069800	You all make me amazingly happy, so keep up the good work and have a great week, Apollo.
1069800	1073960	PS, I'm sure you all will be talking about the 2DX testing in Illinois on next week's
1073960	1074960	show.
1074960	1075960	Isn't that super exciting?
1075960	1076960	There you go.
1076960	1083800	You listen to part A. I'm excited, but I don't think it's going to catch, but we'll see.
1083800	1084800	It's better than nothing.
1084800	1088860	Well, I signed up for a Facebook account just for this, and I'd heard about Facebook before
1088860	1093960	because I have friends that are still in college, like one of my really good friends, his sister.
1093960	1095920	We're all on Facebook at the college there.
1095920	1098920	She goes to Vassar, and every single student there, I think, has a Facebook account.
1098920	1101680	Isn't that like a textile college?
1101680	1104080	No, no, no, no.
1104080	1107160	I think it was a woman's college back in the day, but it's a very pretty campus, though,
1107160	1108160	but that's regardless.
1108160	1109440	Does anyone from Vassar listen to the program?
1109440	1110440	You should send me an email.
1110440	1112200	I actually was there a couple months ago.
1112200	1113280	Anyway, that's not the point.
1113280	1118360	The point is we have an Orange Lounge Radio community on Facebook, and you can find it
1118360	1122000	by searching for Orange Lounge Radio, and I actually signed up for a Facebook account,
1122000	1126960	and yeah, it's kind of like Myspace without the page customization and all that weird
1126960	1131560	stuff that brings Myspace to a strange level, but what I think is really interesting is
1131560	1133680	that you update people of your status.
1133680	1137620	So for those of you that remember Jonas, aka Explicit, that came onto this program, he's
1137620	1142720	on my friend's page, and it told me last night, Jonas is out at a party, and I was like, wow,
1142720	1145040	that's amazing that the internet tells me these things.
1145040	1147960	Amazing what the internet has accomplished.
1147960	1152200	I think it's awesome that somebody else created this community and that people were already
1152200	1153880	joining it before we even got an email on it.
1153880	1156280	So big hug and kisses to you guys out there.
1156280	1161560	Well, our next email actually comes from, let me see, from Stacy.
1161560	1166320	It says, hello, I've been listening to the Orange Lounge station for about a week now,
1166320	1167960	and I have a question about the playlist.
1167960	1172000	It seems that the majority of the songs are from DDR or BeatMania or from other similar
1172000	1173000	games.
1173000	1176140	There were very few, very, very few songs that weren't dance, eurobeat, et cetera.
1176140	1179340	Why is it advertised as a station dedicated to video games when there's no bias toward
1179340	1180880	dance type games?
1180880	1183280	From what I read on the site, I understand that it started out as being a tribute to
1183280	1186800	those kinds of games, but now, aside from the shows, there's very little to distinguish
1186800	1189200	it from the typical dance station.
1189200	1192660	So if this sounds like an attack, it really is, and I'm generally curious about this.
1192660	1195000	I think we just haven't filtered out a lot of the old stuff.
1195000	1196000	Yeah.
1196000	1198180	That's the majority of the stuff, because they were all there before.
1198180	1202620	To be honest, well, we did do a pretty big reshuffle when we went to MP3 Pro about a
1202620	1208520	year and a half ago, but I think that's what's been high rated, and there are other places
1208520	1213120	out there where you can hear just regular gaming music, but I find that a lot of the
1213120	1218700	orchestral gaming music can kind of be like, not that it's bad or anything, but without
1218700	1221960	the game there, it doesn't make for the most entertaining radio.
1221960	1226800	We try to keep the music that's in our rotation upbeat a little more, but certainly it could
1226800	1232160	use some help in getting the music buffed up with some other picks that are very upbeat.
1232160	1235020	So certainly we welcome your suggestions on music we could add to the stream.
1235020	1238520	The really bizarre stuff was from me, by the way.
1238520	1243060	Keep in mind, though, we still feel justified in calling ourselves radio dedicated to video
1243060	1247400	gaming because of the live shows that we do, which is really the focus of the station.
1247400	1250640	I have to be honest, even though the 24-7 music program is what's there most of the
1250640	1253280	time, it's actually the lowest on our priority chain.
1253280	1257540	We're more into bringing you guys the live interactive stuff than just a bunch of MP3s
1257540	1259080	on shuffle, to be honest.
1259080	1263520	So we're glad that somebody is listening to live stream, though, and caring, and certainly
1263520	1269960	we'll take another look at what's in rotation and maybe try to liven it up a little.
1269960	1280480	Next email comes from XenionELDDR, this is my first time writing, and first of all, I
1280480	1283480	want to say that your show is awesome and continue the good work.
1283480	1284480	Smiley.
1284480	1288120	Well, the reason I am writing is because I have a question on a certain comedy game that
1288120	1293680	has piqued my interest as of late, as learning if Konami's Oz will ever be released in America.
1293680	1296880	I know that the game is about a year and a half old, but I've seen YouTube video with
1296880	1301520	an English dubbed French, I think text version of the game, and I think that they would try
1301520	1305080	to put English text in the game because I, for one, would wait until they were done putting
1305080	1307200	the text in and buy it with no questions asked.
1307200	1311440	I also ask this because I'm considering buying the import version if it does not make it
1311440	1316000	overseas, or if there is a way to try to persuade Konami of America to releasing it over here,
1316000	1319400	because I need to buy an import PS2, and if not, as you can really see, I want this game,
1319400	1324720	but not only because this is a run-on sentence that's never-ending, this game, but I've always
1324720	1328640	wanted to try out popin' music and other 2DX games besides the English one I own.
1328640	1329640	Period!
1329640	1330640	Thank you.
1330640	1333120	Hopefully you can help me out, and thank you for taking the time to read this email.
1333120	1335320	Again, your show rules.
1335320	1336320	Thank you.
1336320	1337840	That was a really big, freaking long run-up.
1337840	1341720	I'm not trying to poke or anything, it's just like...
1341720	1342720	That's why no one emails us.
1342720	1343720	Punctuation!
1343720	1345720	Tell me when I can take a breath.
1345720	1349800	Pause on PlayStation 2 is not going to come out in this country, and I don't think there's
1349800	1353760	a lot that can be done at this point because PlayStation 2 is slowly being phased out,
1353760	1357440	so unfortunately you're probably going to have to import that one.
1357440	1361480	But I don't think it's ever a bad idea to certainly petition the game makers for the
1361480	1363360	games you want to see.
1363360	1366520	Send emails, let them know.
1366520	1372100	I know a company like Konami, they're somewhat out there reading some of the stuff out there
1372100	1375520	on the internet, so I'm not saying you should go on a board and bitch about it, but send
1375520	1376520	emails.
1376520	1377520	They do care.
1377520	1380720	And that goes with any gaming company, not just Konami, but any gaming company.
1380720	1385320	Let them know, you want to see it here.
1385320	1392460	The next one is actually a link that was sent to us by JeremyTodd1, which I think is actually
1392460	1395920	pretty cool.
1395920	1402320	Apparently the folks at Xbox Magazine used Miis for the staff picture, so they were doing
1402320	1407080	their nod toward Nintendo, and it actually is...
1407080	1416880	If you go to gonintendo.com slash wp-content slash photos slash miioxm.jpg, you can see
1416880	1417880	the image.
1417880	1421280	It's been the last two issues.
1421280	1422680	Unfortunately I get the magazine.
1422680	1426840	Originally I signed up for it to get demos because I was like, ooh, ooh, you know, time
1426840	1427840	shift demo.
1427840	1428840	That's not out yet.
1428840	1434920	Unfortunately the last few demos have all been crap, so that kind of sucks.
1434920	1437360	Well why the sudden appearance of Miis in the magazine?
1437360	1443560	Is that just furthering that odd affection that Microsoft has for Nintendo right now,
1443560	1444560	like all these subtle comments?
1444560	1447200	They want to recreate pictures of themselves.
1447200	1452520	But using your competitors, because essentially Nintendo is still their competitor, because
1452520	1456840	even though Microsoft might have somehow embraced this Wii 16, I mean, it's odd because you
1456840	1462500	see Major Nelson says nice things about the Wii in his blog, Trixie, I've read her thing
1462500	1466400	on xbox.com, she said nice things about the Wii at one point, and it's kind of like Microsoft
1466400	1470160	kind of has this professional respect for the Wii, but that doesn't seem to be reciprocated
1470160	1471160	by Nintendo.
1471160	1476400	I mean, there might be a respect, but Reggie has flat out said, don't buy a 360, buy more
1476400	1478960	Wii games, essentially, in so many words.
1478960	1484360	So it's just kind of interesting that Microsoft keeps handing these olive branches over to
1484360	1489440	Nintendo, like, hey, let's fight Sony together.
1489440	1492440	Weird.
1492440	1495960	I think that maybe they're just trying to screw with the consumer's heads.
1495960	1500240	GS68 in our chat room says, come on, Reggie, make love, not war.
1500240	1502840	So how about the next email, huh?
1502840	1503840	How about it?
1503840	1509880	Dear OLR, Hi guys, DDR Dollar Bill here, and probably changing my name in the future, long
1509880	1510880	story.
1510880	1514280	In spirit, as long as I'm not going to be in the chat room on Sunday, my crazy self
1514280	1518400	is in Vegas doing some partying with my family and probably a few hundred crazies.
1518400	1519400	Lucky.
1519400	1521360	But I do have one thing I'd like to ask.
1521360	1526240	While I was making my pre-reserve for DDR Universe, I had a glance at the future release's
1526240	1527240	date list.
1527240	1531240	Even took home a copy, it helps knowing friends at GameStop, and sell Guitar Hero 2.
1531240	1535000	Now, I know this is most likely will be a port of the PS2, but we had a discussion about
1535000	1538400	the rumor of Guitar Hero having a future release of all 80 songs.
1538400	1543000	True or not, it did get me thinking, would having music games concentrate on a certain
1543000	1546000	genre make them more appealing to the mass market?
1546000	1550560	Would it also make it more interesting for those already addicted to the games themselves?
1550560	1551800	It's just my thought of the week.
1551800	1555800	Anyhoo, there's my $2 to the show, I hope you all have fun, and it goes to the chat
1555800	1556920	room buddies as well.
1556920	1557920	DDR Dollar Bill.
1557920	1558920	Nope.
1558920	1560920	It won't make them appeal the more people know why.
1560920	1562920	Seems to be working for Karaoke Revolution.
1562920	1563920	Country?
1563920	1564920	No, it sucked.
1564920	1565920	I thought it was pretty cool.
1565920	1568200	I played it, and I don't even like country music.
1568200	1569200	It was awful.
1569200	1570200	I liked it.
1570200	1571440	It was a good game.
1571440	1577280	Then again, I have a huge distaste for country music.
1577280	1582080	I want to say a response to the Guitar Hero 80 songs thing.
1582080	1586120	Rumor and emphasis on rumor is that some of the downloadable packs will have some of the
1586120	1592040	Guitar Hero 1 songs in them, but I bet you 10 to 1 you would have an easier time seeing
1592040	1597160	the indie label stuff crossover than you would the major label stuff crossover, because they're
1597160	1599080	going to have to re-license and all that stuff.
1599080	1600920	I think they would have to.
1600920	1605360	So you'd have a better chance of seeing some of the harmonics house bands, or freeze pop,
1605360	1609240	things like that coming over from Guitar Hero 1 than some of the licensed tracks, but that's
1609240	1610240	not a no.
1610240	1616840	That's just a rumor says right now.
1616840	1623280	Moving on, hey OLR people, particularly Rob.
1623280	1627480	So I bought an Xbox 360 some months ago, and my roommate bought a Wii at launch.
1627480	1632000	We love many of the games on the systems, but I think that it's time I bought myself
1632000	1636800	a good gaming PC to play some games that I've never been able to play before, and I have
1636800	1638920	decided to go with Commodore 64.
1638920	1639920	You win the internet.
1639920	1640920	Who is this?
1640920	1641920	You win the internet.
1641920	1642920	You'll see.
1642920	1643920	All right.
1643920	1646480	I understand you know a bit about that particular machine, and I was wondering if there's anything
1646480	1649640	you recommend I look for when going out and buying one.
1649640	1650640	Kickstart.
1650640	1651640	Make sure it works.
1651640	1655800	Are there particular cables and things that I need to make sure I get, or particular accessories
1655800	1657920	or games that you recommend I look for?
1657920	1661620	I was thinking about how all of the current next gen consoles offer extra features like
1661620	1667140	media playback and use in weather channels, and I realized that the C64 can be used as
1667140	1671320	a musical instrument, so it's a good contender for my next game platform.
1671320	1672320	Thanks in advance.
1672320	1675680	Regards, Warrior Bob.
1675680	1677000	You rock, Warrior Bob.
1677000	1680400	You can hook up a Commodore 64 to a television.
1680400	1682960	I'm trying to remember, it's been so long, and I had a monitor.
1682960	1686600	I never hooked up the Commodore 64 to a TV, but I seem to remember the hookups were very
1686600	1687600	similar.
1687600	1691960	The video component was almost the exact same between the two, so you might need some type
1691960	1695840	of special converter, though, to actually hook it up to a television.
1695840	1697080	Did you guys have Commodore 64s?
1697080	1698080	I thought Rice Princess did.
1698080	1699080	No, but you know who did?
1699080	1700080	Who?
1700080	1701080	Captain Kirk.
1701080	1702080	Look, Rice Princess.
1702080	1703080	Shut up.
1703080	1704080	You had a Commodore 64, right?
1704080	1705080	Yeah.
1705080	1706080	Did you have it hooked up to a TV?
1706080	1707080	No.
1707080	1708080	Do you remember if there were special cables?
1708080	1709080	I can't remember.
1709080	1710080	I can't remember either.
1710080	1711080	I know.
1711080	1712080	It's been so long.
1712080	1713080	What about games that you remember on the Commodore 64?
1713080	1714080	Impossible Mission.
1714080	1715080	Dude, Impossible Mission was awesome.
1715080	1721200	What was that game, The Last Ninja, or Revenge of the Ninja, or something that game was?
1721200	1722200	That game was awesome.
1722200	1723200	Revenge of the Ninja was on the Game Boy.
1723200	1725200	I think it's The Last Ninja, is what it was called.
1725200	1726800	Revenge of the Ninja was on the Sega CD.
1726800	1727880	It was a cinematic game.
1727880	1730400	Lazy Jones was a fun game, because that was a bunch of mini games.
1730400	1731400	Load Runner.
1731400	1732400	It's better than Fusion Frenzy.
1732400	1733400	I can't remember.
1733400	1736640	We had nations on Mars or something, like they were the Mars Zoggers.
1736640	1737920	Pinball Construction Set.
1737920	1739320	That game's awesome, too.
1739320	1740320	Oh, shut up!
1740320	1741320	It's awesome!
1741320	1746040	It does not require a special monitor, it can be plugged into a TV.
1746040	1748400	That's what it says on Wikipedia.
1748400	1752760	I was going to say, though, Kickstart.
1752760	1755520	That is the only game I ever played on the Commodore 64.
1755520	1758640	Is that the one with the button, and you kick with the little clown, and you kick the balloons
1758640	1759640	around the screen?
1759640	1760640	No, it's a dirt bike racing game.
1760640	1761640	Oh, I'm thinking of a different game.
1761640	1762640	It's very similar to Excitebike.
1762640	1763640	Kickman!
1763640	1764640	Never mind.
1764640	1767800	Excite, it is very similar to Excitebike, so Kickstart.
1767800	1768800	Gotta get that game.
1768800	1769800	Winter Games.
1769800	1770800	Winter Games.
1770800	1771800	Bard's Tale.
1771800	1776280	Oh, GameTap has a lot of Commodore 64 games on it, so if you want to try some out, GameTap
1776280	1777280	has a bunch.
1777280	1779680	I'm trying to find the game that I used to play all the time.
1779680	1783060	I thought it was Bard's Tale, but I tried to look it up, and all the ones that I came
1783060	1785240	up with did not look anything.
1785240	1786240	What was that game?
1786240	1787240	The Seven Scrolls, or whatever that game was?
1787240	1791160	No, all I remember is a miasmal cur from the game.
1791160	1793400	That's the only thing that sticks out in my mind.
1793400	1798520	Well good luck with your Commodore 64 adventures, and you have to try GEOS at some point.
1798520	1800080	GEOS?
1800080	1802320	See the Commodore 64 as a Mac.
1802320	1803320	Oh, God.
1803320	1806400	Dude, the Commodore 64 was awesome.
1806400	1807680	I love the Commodore 64.
1807680	1810600	There's a picture on Wikipedia.
1810600	1815000	Just about any arcade game that was out in the early 80s had a port on the Commodore
1815000	1816000	64.
1816000	1817000	You name it.
1817000	1819520	Donkey Kong, Kongo Bongo, whatever, it's out there.
1819520	1821120	And Captain Kirk did have one.
1821120	1823920	There was a Star Trek game on the Commodore 64, you smartass.
1823920	1827760	Yeah, he had one in Star Trek II.
1827760	1831040	Let us know what Commodore 64... In fact, I would urge all our listeners at some point
1831040	1835840	this week, because there is a website where you can play Commodore 64 games.
1835840	1839840	I can't remember what the hell it was.
1839840	1840840	Maybe somebody in chat remembers.
1840840	1845440	There was some site that had nothing but Java Commodore 64 games, so you can play a ton
1845440	1847880	of them online.
1847880	1853400	I urge everyone to play one Commodore 64 game this week, and check out the roots of PC gaming.
1853400	1855400	Definitely make it an impossible mission.
1855400	1861240	Okay, so speaking of the Commodore 64, who had a TI-85?
1861240	1864720	I know what they are, but I didn't have one, because we had a Commodore 64.
1864720	1865720	They were better.
1865720	1867720	I had a Coleco, I had an Atom.
1867720	1870600	Anyway... And if you had an Apple II, I'm sorry.
1870600	1875720	We had one at my school, and I played a lot of Kix, and that was all I cared about.
1875720	1879320	Somebody in our chat room, Kamara, says Lemon64.com.
1879320	1880320	I've never seen this site.
1880320	1882800	This isn't the same site I use, but it looks like this will work.
1882800	1883800	I think you can do this.
1883800	1884800	I'm going to try it.
1884800	1886640	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1886640	1889160	This comes from Cutie Honey.
1889160	1891320	I just got two things to say this time.
1891320	1894920	I recall a comment at the end of the Sunday show where Rob said that the show needs more
1894920	1895920	gay people.
1895920	1898000	Well, I guess you can count me as the O.O.
1898000	1899000	Army's first bisexual.
1899000	1900000	Pleasure to meet you guys.
1900000	1904360	I'm sorry you've been... You're beaten to that from show one.
1904360	1905680	Sorry.
1905680	1911240	Second, on a completely different note, two weeks ago you guys started a discussion about
1911240	1914000	games that have too many sequels and remakes.
1914000	1919440	In chat, I brought up the fact that DDR had many games, and suddenly a ton of people went
1919440	1920440	crazy.
1920440	1921720	A fun kind of crazy, mind you.
1921720	1922720	Wait, wait, wait.
1922720	1923720	Bisexual male or female?
1923720	1924720	Male.
1924720	1925720	Over 18?
1925720	1926720	Single?
1926720	1927720	Did he attach a picture?
1927720	1928720	No.
1928720	1929720	Just kidding.
1929720	1930720	I'm kidding.
1930720	1931720	I'm kidding.
1931720	1932720	Rob, can I finish the email?
1932720	1933720	I'm sorry.
1933720	1934720	It's Valentine's Day, and I'm single.
1934720	1935720	Rob, it's not Valentine's Day.
1935720	1936720	Do you know what I'm doing on Valentine's Day?
1936720	1937720	Crochets.
1937720	1947200	Having my neck adjusted and going to school.
1947200	1948200	Fun.
1948200	1949200	How romantic.
1949200	1952200	Anyway, can I finish reading the email, please?
1952200	1953200	Yes, you may.
1953200	1954200	Okay.
1954200	1955200	Where was I?
1955200	1956200	Oh, yeah.
1956200	1958160	So, here's the burning question.
1958160	1962200	Do you think Konami beats a dead horse by releasing several Bimani games each year with
1962200	1963640	only different song lists?
1963640	1964640	Excuse me.
1964640	1967360	I blame the orange soda for that.
1967360	1971720	Although I'm not helping the situation by buying every PS2 DDR game that gets released,
1971720	1976560	it's kind of annoying to see some new features like battle mode added when you have to ask
1976560	1979120	yourself why didn't they add it last year.
1979120	1985160	The cheap rational bastard in me would rather like a DDR game that has over 150 songs in
1985160	1990360	it with more modes graphical upgrades in 2008 than a 70-song game with two new dancing avatars
1990360	1991360	later this year.
1991360	1993120	Anyway, thanks for your time.
1993120	1996440	I spent an hour going to school on public transportation, and your podcast keeps it
1996440	1997680	from being boring.
1997680	2000280	Keep up the good work, cutie honey.
2000280	2001840	All right.
2001840	2003640	Wait, no honey fresh?
2003640	2004640	No?
2004640	2008880	I thought that was going to be all that she was planning for.
2008880	2013080	You know, I think the Bimani games coming out very similar every year with different
2013080	2014080	song lists.
2014080	2015080	Keep in mind there's new modes.
2015080	2018020	Usually, Konami tries to throw something new in it every time, whether it be the single
2018020	2021520	player mission master or the hands and feet or whatever new thing they did.
2021520	2027280	But I would say it's no different than the Madden 06, 07, 08 games that come out.
2027280	2030560	And some people don't get that just like some people don't get the DDR games that come out
2030560	2031560	every year.
2031560	2035360	I think it's just kind of if you're into that, then you kind of accept that as part of what
2035360	2037320	the games go through each year with the change.
2037320	2041160	So that's what I say.
2041160	2045720	With the new songs come new step charts and new challenges, you know, I don't know.
2045720	2050220	But see, from the other perspective, ask somebody who doesn't play DDR as much as I do and they
2050220	2051960	probably think, it's stupid.
2051960	2052960	It's the same game every time.
2052960	2056440	And you know, that's just, you know, that's how some of us, what some of us say about
2056440	2059040	Madden is that, you know, it's roster update 2007.
2059040	2062160	Well, you know, we don't really play those games, so we don't understand.
2062160	2065320	So I try not to say that if I do, it's in jest.
2065320	2069840	It actually in the beginning with DDR, it used to have a lot of significant changes
2069840	2070840	with each one.
2070840	2078120	You know, the first I remember, you know, with Fifth Mix, you had the actual tempo freezes,
2078120	2080520	which was like, you know, when you first played, you're like, what the fuck?
2080520	2082800	You know, the song stopped.
2082800	2083800	Someone broke the machine.
2083800	2085920	Oh, it started up again.
2085920	2087240	So that was kind of neat.
2087240	2094420	And then, of course, you had tempo changes, you know, and Fourth Mix and stuff like that.
2094420	2101080	And then, you know, with Max, you had freeze notes, which, you know, were definitely different
2101080	2102080	at the time.
2102080	2103080	I don't know.
2103080	2105280	So they keep, they try to keep it pretty fresh with each one.
2105280	2109080	But you know, after a while, they do start looking very similar.
2109080	2112440	Dude, I got a friend request on Facebook.
2112440	2113440	The show rocks.
2113440	2116600	Is it a hot gay man?
2116600	2117600	No, it's not.
2117600	2118600	No hot gay man?
2118600	2119600	Oh.
2119600	2120600	No.
2120600	2121600	That was the last email, so.
2121600	2122600	Straight man.
2122600	2123600	Yep.
2123600	2124600	But a cool one.
2124600	2125600	Yeah.
2125600	2126600	What's your Facebook address, Rob?
2126600	2127600	You don't have addresses on Facebook.
2127600	2128600	You have to look me up by name.
2128600	2129600	But I use my stage name, Rob Roberts.
2129600	2130600	Really?
2130600	2131600	So it's easy to find me on Facebook.
2131600	2132600	That's cool.
2132600	2133600	Jamie, you should get a Facebook, too.
2133600	2134600	That's kind of fun.
2134600	2135600	That's okay.
2135600	2136600	I have.
2136600	2137600	Oh, I got another one, too.
2137600	2138600	Look at this.
2138600	2139600	Oh, I'm popular.
2139600	2140600	Yay.
2140600	2141600	All right.
2141600	2145080	Speaking of popular, you know what game is popular out there?
2145080	2146080	Gears of War.
2146080	2148880	I mean, everyone's got a big heart on over Gears of War.
2148880	2151040	Except for me, because I don't really like the game.
2151040	2159280	But anyways, it did win eight awards at the 10th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.
2159280	2162840	And these aren't like achievement points, but you know, whatever.
2162840	2171240	It did win a bunch of different awards, including Game of the Year, Best Console Game, Best
2171240	2181260	Animation, let's see here, among some other ones here, Best Outstanding Character Performance
2181260	2191560	of a Male, Best Online Gameplay, Best Visual Engineering, and Action Adventure Game of
2191560	2193400	the Year.
2193400	2194560	Surprise.
2194560	2198040	You know, Gears of War wins more awards.
2198040	2199040	What?
2199040	2206320	No, I'm actually with Loki, I mean, eh, you know, I could care less.
2206320	2207320	Why?
2207320	2209160	Well, Gears of War is a phenomenal game.
2209160	2210160	Blah, blah, blah.
2210160	2211160	So is Halo, but that one sucks, too.
2211160	2212160	That's what everybody on the internet says.
2212160	2213160	It must be true.
2213160	2217520	When Halo 3 comes out this year, and even if it isn't as good as Gears of War, and you
2217520	2223040	know, it could be like half as good as Gears of War or whatever, people will still be giving
2223040	2228720	this thing awards and getting a big boner over this game because it's Halo.
2228720	2229720	I don't know.
2229720	2234920	My Gears was okay, but I mean, just, I don't know, it didn't give me the boner it gave
2234920	2237400	the rest of the internet, I guess.
2237400	2241080	Anyhow, this might give a lot of sci-fi fans a boner, though.
2241080	2245200	Eddie, get your hand away from me.
2245200	2255360	According to the Hollywood Reporter, Universal MBC, which is part of Vivendi, they are working
2255360	2260280	on a space combat game, it's like a sim game, set in the Battlestar Galactica universe,
2260280	2262760	and I'm talking the new one, not the old one.
2262760	2264560	Or Galaxy Bellactica.
2264560	2270840	Digital download for PC and Xbox Live Arcade, and there's a tie-in, by the way, with Xbox
2270840	2276080	because there's new Battlestar Galactica gamer picks and themes available for low amounts
2276080	2277080	of Microsoft points.
2277080	2279280	Are the characters going to cry their emo tears?
2279280	2281200	Hey, Battlestar Galactica is a pretty good show.
2281200	2284120	I don't know if you've ever actually watched it, it's actually pretty good.
2284120	2285960	It's the Krylons, not the Cylons.
2285960	2286960	Whatever.
2286960	2287960	Stop being uneducated.
2287960	2292320	It will be hard for Eddie, I'm kidding.
2292320	2295300	I'm looking forward to seeing what this looks like on Xbox Live, I bet it's fun.
2295300	2299480	I don't care about Xbox, but on PC it's going to be awesome.
2299480	2303920	I have some news that people might care about, but I don't know, not really.
2303920	2308840	But we have friends at Buena Vista Games, at least they've always been really, really
2308840	2313200	great at E3 to work with because when Square says, you can't film that, they're like, here,
2313200	2316320	let me play it while you film it.
2316320	2319520	But they have renamed themselves.
2319520	2324440	They are now called Disney Interactive Studios.
2324440	2327400	They're dissed.
2327400	2331160	So they're officially now making their Disney affiliation public.
2331160	2336040	So when we see Kingdom Hearts and the Disney Interactive Studios, we get it.
2336040	2344000	They're still doing non-Disney games, too, to every extent extra, which is one of them.
2344000	2348760	But they are now officially Disney oriented.
2348760	2355320	Just like Disney presents the M-rated dinosaur-hunting Turok coming out later this year.
2355320	2356560	That should be interesting.
2356560	2357560	Disney's Turok.
2357560	2360440	I wonder if we'll have a theme ride based on that.
2360440	2364840	Maybe we should have crossover because Disney owns ABC as well, so we should have crossover
2364840	2366480	with the characters from Dinosaur.
2366480	2369960	Not the mama, boo!
2369960	2370960	Awesome.
2370960	2372800	That would be awesome.
2372800	2378280	I hope there's some TGIF fans out there that get my joke, or I'm going to look stupid as
2378280	2379280	usual.
2379280	2380280	Anyway.
2380280	2383760	Let's give it up for 92, y'all!
2383760	2386080	92 in the house!
2386080	2388400	Well this might make some people happy.
2388400	2394120	Square Enix confirms a brand new MMO coming to 360 and Vista, and possibly the PlayStation
2394120	2395120	3.
2395120	2401200	But whether it's going to be a sequel to Final Fantasy XI, maybe Final Fantasy XIV, huh?
2401200	2402200	Huh?
2402200	2403200	Again?
2403200	2404200	Final Fantasy XI-II.
2404200	2405560	11D blue.
2405560	2411840	Or as some folks on the internet might say, Final Fantasy XI-II.
2411840	2414120	Because remember how everybody said Final Fantasy X-II?
2414120	2419640	We had this huge debate, and we actually emailed Square to have them settle the debate on whether
2419640	2421360	it was called X-II or X-X-X.
2421360	2422360	Forget it.
2422360	2423360	It was funny.
2423360	2424360	Uh, anyways.
2424360	2429320	Rice Princess, you look very excited about the prospect of Final Fantasy XI-II or Final
2429320	2430320	Fantasy XIV.
2430320	2434920	I'm going to crap my pants in eager anticipation.
2434920	2436600	What if it's Chrono Trigger Online?
2436600	2437680	Fuck yeah, I'll play that!
2437680	2438680	There you go!
2438680	2439680	Hell yeah!
2439680	2441680	That's where I'm really going to crap my pants.
2441680	2446160	Ew, that's kind of gross.
2446160	2449400	What if it's, like, Saga Frontier Online?
2449400	2450680	Pass!
2450680	2453040	I would be the only person playing it!
2453040	2454040	Probably!
2454040	2455040	Like, yes!
2455040	2457040	I can farm all the gold.
2457040	2458600	That's it.
2458600	2460880	Okay, we can move on.
2460880	2465160	I would play Final Fantasy XI-II, because as much crap as I get Final Fantasy XI now,
2465160	2468800	I did waste two and a half years of my life on it, so there must have been something in
2468800	2470520	that game I saw, and it was-
2470520	2471520	Add it!
2471520	2472520	Add it!
2472520	2480280	It was a good game while it lasted, but I'm in full Final Fantasy XI recovery.
2480280	2481280	That's gross.
2481280	2483680	No, it was actually the people.
2483680	2486280	The over-18 link shell people I had.
2486280	2490280	I got a mighty big link shell here for you.
2490280	2494360	Uni in our chat room is a self-confessed FFXI whore.
2494360	2495360	There you go.
2495360	2498680	I win, I spent four years, says Uni.
2498680	2499680	I feel your pain.
2499680	2505320	Have you ever spent real money on gold?
2505320	2508640	That was the point when I knew I had to quit, when I was contemplating spending real money
2508640	2509640	on gold.
2509640	2512920	Rob, I'm sorry, that's just a little bit too-
2512920	2514380	That's why I quit!
2514380	2516400	Because I said, you know what, no, that's actually-
2516400	2517680	Good for you, Rob!
2517680	2520860	The other reason why I quit is because when I was sitting there for an hour, literally
2520860	2525900	doing nothing, waiting for a party, I was like, I can't take this anymore.
2525900	2529040	Waiting for a pretend party in the game?
2529040	2530880	A panty party!
2530880	2531880	That's awesome!
2531880	2533840	Like your friends call you, what are you doing?
2533840	2535680	Oh, waiting for a party to start?
2535680	2536680	Sweet!
2536680	2538280	Sweet, can I come over?
2538280	2539280	Oh no, it's online.
2539280	2540280	No, it's online.
2540280	2541280	It's my online friend.
2541280	2542280	We're gonna do a raid.
2542280	2546040	Well, look, you do the same fucking thing in World of Warcraft, you have no room to
2546040	2547040	talk.
2547040	2548040	You know what I do?
2548040	2549040	I jump around a tree for ten minutes-
2549040	2552000	You tell Chuck Norris jokes in the barons while you wait for a party, that's the only
2552000	2553000	difference.
2553000	2554000	No, I don't.
2554000	2558520	I talk to all of my geeky friends on WoW while I'm jumping around a tree for half an hour,
2558520	2559520	and I could be leveling.
2559520	2560840	All right, anyhow.
2560840	2564880	I was looking real quickly since you mentioned buying gold, and everyone's favorite site
2564880	2571800	to hate, ige.com, they actually have options where you can purchase gold amounts up to
2571800	2575280	fifty million, or at least Gil.
2575280	2576280	Fifty million!
2576280	2581640	Fifty million Gil, which is $1,563.50, who the fuck would spend that real money-
2581640	2587300	Oh my god, oh no, that's lame, hey, wait a minute, whatever happened to our donation,
2587300	2588680	we never spent it, huh?
2588680	2589680	Just kidding.
2589680	2592900	You know what, Rob, I am policing that, okay?
2592900	2595080	And we're going to use it to send me to ASIN.
2595080	2597240	No, yeah, then I'm policing that now.
2597240	2598240	No.
2598240	2600920	She'll be all like, back me donation, please.
2600920	2605160	No, but will you please tell the back me wool story to our listeners?
2605160	2606160	Why?
2606160	2607160	It's lame.
2607160	2608160	Because it's funny, no, just tell it.
2608160	2609160	Tell it, it's a WoW story.
2609160	2612900	Okay, so Brad was playing WoW, and some guy opened a trade window with him, and just gave
2612900	2618320	him a bunch of wool, and then they just whispered to him, uh, tailoring?
2618320	2619720	And he's like, no.
2619720	2623320	And the guy's like, back me wool, please.
2623320	2627800	And I don't know if Brad gave it back or not, but I thought it was funny, because it's a
2627800	2628800	Chinese farmer.
2628800	2629800	There's the inside joke!
2629800	2630800	That's hilarious.
2630800	2636320	But, you have to understand, now Irene is a hunter character, and her pet is, or no,
2636320	2641720	the name of her character is back me wool, and the name of the pet is please.
2641720	2642880	And nobody gets that.
2642880	2643880	I do.
2643880	2647080	And now our listeners will, if they ever play on Ravencrest.
2647080	2650560	Yeah, don't play on Ravencrest.
2650560	2651560	Oh, Har.
2651560	2652560	Oh, wow.
2652560	2653560	Trainwreck.
2653560	2654560	Choo choo.
2654560	2659040	Oh, I'm sorry, oh shit, it's my turn for a story, my bad.
2659040	2663800	Yeah, Rob, I'm sitting here waiting on Rob, and you're telling Chuck Norris jokes in my
2663800	2664800	eye lockup.
2664800	2668680	I'm writing the show off tonight, I'm just writing it off, because this is not a good
2668680	2669680	show.
2669680	2670680	All right, no, I'm kidding.
2670680	2671680	This show is off.
2671680	2672680	This is amazing.
2672680	2673680	Silly, silly.
2673680	2676840	All right, here's another rule that is amazing.
2676840	2680980	GameStop, you probably have read about this on your favorite blog, but I know some folks
2680980	2683880	here in the studio have got to share their stuff on this.
2683880	2687360	Now there's legislation out there, of course, looking to get stricter penalties on games.
2687360	2692280	Well, GameStop released an internal memo this week, actually it was a conference call, and
2692280	2696560	managers were told about a new rule, it's a new strict policy, this is it.
2696560	2704220	If you sell a game, an M-rated game, to an underage customer, you get fired, and if you're
2704220	2710320	the manager of that store, whether you were there or not, you get fired as well, for managing
2710320	2711320	such a shitty employee.
2711320	2712880	I'm so glad that Dan quit.
2712880	2715480	GameStop, it doesn't work there, but what do you think of this policy?
2715480	2718280	I think it's retarded, and I'm glad that Dan quit.
2718280	2719280	Why?
2719280	2725280	Well, the manager, I agree that the manager should have better trained the employee, but
2725280	2727360	really it's the employee that should suffer for it.
2727360	2730480	I think that the manager should be written up.
2730480	2731480	I think that's acceptable.
2731480	2734880	What are you going to do, make me work overtime?
2734880	2738620	I'm just going to sell an M-rated game to a six-year-old, and then you're going to get
2738620	2739620	your ass fired.
2739620	2741160	I don't give a shit about this job.
2741160	2745760	Let's go get another one.
2745760	2749920	I think it's retarded because there's no actual law that says you have to do that, but hey,
2749920	2752640	whatever, that's their store policy, I guess.
2752640	2757680	Just make sure you follow it, but yeah, who cares?
2757680	2763080	I remember there was a news thing also where people were doing a sting to see who they
2763080	2769600	can get to sell a six-year-old or whatever.
2769600	2773920	Is that like that Dateline NBC where they trap people on the internet and get them to
2773920	2779880	come over wearing no pants to meet the 12-year-old girl, and then the reporter guy jumps out
2779880	2785680	and says, surprise, I'm from NBC, and the guy's like, I'm so embarrassed.
2785680	2787600	Is it like that, but for games?
2787600	2790880	Something like that.
2790880	2795460	Every time I watch Dateline, every time I've ever watched Dateline, it's that.
2795460	2798480	They should just call it the pedophile show.
2798480	2801720	I bet more people would watch if they changed their name from Dateline to the pedophile
2801720	2802720	show.
2802720	2803720	Pedophile show.
2803720	2808120	Yeah, they could have a little cheesy thing.
2808120	2811840	This is really bad tonight.
2811840	2813600	Shadownextgen in chat.
2813600	2817560	Thank you, chat room, for keeping us on track here, chat.orangeontrader.com.
2817560	2821220	Shadownextgen says, the policy where managers get fired because of what their employees
2821220	2824360	did is fucked up.
2824360	2828920	I think they're responsible for training the employees properly, and so writing up is not
2828920	2829920	good.
2829920	2832840	Yeah, but what if I'm so mad at my manager and I'm going to quit anyway?
2832840	2835880	I'm going to sell a game to fuck my manager over, too.
2835880	2836880	That's kind of screwed up.
2836880	2840520	I would hope there's a way to dispute the firing or something.
2840520	2844720	And to be honest, the only way they're going to get in trouble is if the fucking parent
2844720	2851160	says, hey, I didn't know this game had that kind of content in it, if you tell the parent
2851160	2852960	or whatever.
2852960	2859560	What if, for example, Billy has his friend's older brother buy the game for him or something
2859560	2864880	like that, and then gets into Billy's hands and his parents go, where the fuck do you
2864880	2865880	get this from?
2865880	2871920	Well, the GameStop people sold it to me, and now people are getting fired because of that.
2871920	2877240	Legend of Zaku makes a very interesting comparison here, says, it's only fair, Jamie, just like
2877240	2881760	an Abu Ghraib, where the people who carried out the torture got the hammer, while the
2881760	2883240	folks who ordered it got off scot-free.
2883240	2885200	Remember the Iraq torture thing?
2885200	2893460	Yeah, but the GameStop owners aren't telling them to sell the games.
2893460	2897800	That was the strangest comparison.
2897800	2900600	No offense to Zaku, because everyone's going to tell their opinions.
2900600	2901600	That was stupid.
2901600	2902600	Wow.
2902600	2903600	I'm sorry.
2903600	2910040	How is that even a... Oh, yeah, we want you to sell this game, oh, and you're fired.
2910040	2913200	That's fucking stupid.
2913200	2918240	God, think before you try to make a witty comparison, thank you.
2918240	2920720	I'm sorry, but that doesn't work.
2920720	2921720	Wow.
2921720	2925680	Yeah, you should be selling more of those stupid, was it more cards or whatever they
2925680	2929160	call them now, the edge cards.
2929160	2933080	But what if they sell them pornographic material?
2933080	2934080	Will they get fired?
2934080	2936080	Or will they get a raise?
2936080	2938080	I got a raise.
2938080	2940280	They get a raise.
2940280	2941280	Wow.
2941280	2942280	Okay.
2942280	2946840	We promised in the year 2007 our New Year's resolution was to do more PC gaming news,
2946840	2949800	so Dark Sakura, could you help us achieve our New Year's resolution?
2949800	2954320	Yes, I will, and this is actually centered towards our European friends.
2954320	2955320	Yeah.
2955320	2956320	Cheers.
2956320	2958320	Did you say jizz?
2958320	2959320	No, cheers.
2959320	2962320	I meant like you said jizz.
2962320	2963320	Jizz.
2963320	2967800	And wait, PC gaming, like politically correct gaming?
2967800	2969800	No, like a personal computer.
2969800	2970800	Because...
2970800	2979760	Anyway, there's a martial arts MMO called Nine Dragons, and the beta is open in Europe,
2979760	2984520	actually opening in Europe, they said that you'll actually be able to play and get double
2984520	2991200	experience until, let's see, actually I'm not finding the date on here is the sad thing.
2991200	2994160	It may be actually open right now.
2994160	2998020	In fact, you can actually apply for the, okay, here it is, you can apply for the beta over
2998020	3006280	on the website, which is ninedragons.acclaim.com slash welcome.htm, and you can keep on going
3006280	3011640	to the site and check out the demo there, but they're doing a double experience push
3011640	3016640	that actually may be over already, by the time I saw this, it was already over.
3016640	3019320	But hey, you can try the game.
3019320	3020320	Cool.
3020320	3023560	Dude, I got three more friend requests on Facebook.
3023560	3024560	I'm so popular.
3024560	3025560	Stop gloating.
3025560	3026560	I'm popular.
3026560	3027560	No.
3027560	3028560	This is great.
3028560	3029560	The internet is awesome.
3029560	3030560	Everybody can be a winner.
3030560	3031560	It's because I just found out.
3031560	3039000	As I mentioned in part A, Galactic Civilizations 2 is getting a brand new expansion pack called
3039000	3040320	Dark Avatar.
3040320	3049600	It's actually being released early, and yeah, you can definitely check it out now if you're
3049600	3057160	into that, and it introduces brand new asteroid builds full of resources and unique planets
3057160	3059400	and other fun stuff like that.
3059400	3064800	I don't play Galactic Civilizations 2, but it sounds fun.
3064800	3069920	Sorry, I wasn't listening.
3069920	3072560	Eddie got a text message and was sharing it with everybody.
3072560	3074720	Was it more friends requests on Facebook?
3074720	3076240	No, it was not a Facebook friend request.
3076240	3077720	I already took care of those.
3077720	3083800	Oh yeah, Dark Avatar, one week early, good times.
3083800	3086160	I'm sorry, a heart.
3086160	3087640	Can I have a hug, Loki?
3087640	3088640	Can I have a hug?
3088640	3090120	Can I have a hug, Jamie?
3090120	3092120	If you buy me dinner.
3092120	3100160	No, I'll buy you coffee, decaf, because I know you don't drink caffeine this late.
3100160	3101480	And potato pancakes.
3101480	3102480	I'll think about it.
3102480	3103480	Do I get a hug right now?
3103480	3104480	Live on air?
3104480	3105480	Yay!
3105480	3109920	Hold on, now I know this isn't TV, but here, I'll put the mic, when I hug Jamie, I'll put
3109920	3113320	the mic kind of at my chest level, so maybe you can hear her boob.
3113320	3115440	I did get that on my boob.
3115440	3116440	Oh my God.
3116440	3120760	If you did want to download the expansion pack, you can go to TotalGaming.net for that.
3120760	3122120	I feel like such a whore now.
3122120	3123480	It's actually available now.
3123480	3126920	I guess the retail version is coming out on the 14th.
3126920	3129560	Rob just made me a whore.
3129560	3136600	Anyhow, now this, I am declaring, I know it's February, but I'm declaring the upcoming news
3136600	3143360	article, the best PC gaming story of 2007, right here.
3143360	3144360	Here it is.
3144360	3147720	This guy, Warrior Bob, who asked what Commodore 64 games, here it is.
3147720	3150880	This is the game, and it's coming back, guys.
3150880	3154240	Arkon is making its return.
3154240	3159880	Originally released in 1983, Arkon was like, it was like chess, but like when the piece
3159880	3162680	of one, I know you remember, Irene, because you're as big of a nerd as me, but for the
3162680	3166240	folks who may not know, Arkon was like chess, but like the pieces would actually do battle
3166240	3168240	with each other when you tried to capture another piece.
3168240	3169240	Oh, battle chess.
3169240	3173740	No, it's not battle chess, because battle chess, the animations were already pre-done.
3173740	3175960	You actually had like a real-time fighting thing.
3175960	3177220	This game was also on the NES.
3177220	3178840	They ported it to several platforms.
3178840	3180880	What about battle chess?
3180880	3183240	Arkon is better, and then there was even Arkon 2 and 3.
3183240	3187400	We don't talk about Arkon 2 and 3, because Arkon was like the best.
3187400	3192200	What's going on, though, is that Murid Interactive, an investment company who is in the video
3192200	3198200	game industry, announced a licensing deal with Freefall Games, who created Arkon, to
3198200	3201040	resurrect the game for modern platforms.
3201040	3202400	That is the most exciting news ever.
3202400	3203960	Here's a quote from Murid Interactive.
3203960	3206480	�We are incredibly pleased to have signed this brand.
3206480	3211280	Arkon is a well-respected license that has huge nostalgic value for the right reasons.
3211280	3215520	The gameplay, the great combination of strategic thinking, and the intense arcade action.�
3215520	3221600	Okay, seriously, if this game comes to Xbox Live Arcade, I will have died from too much
3221600	3223480	orgasm.
3223480	3224480	Like right now?
3224480	3225480	Yeah, seriously.
3225480	3228120	I'm like, look at my pants.
3228120	3229120	Look at my pants.
3229120	3230120	They got bigger.
3230120	3231120	No, please don't.
3231120	3233280	I am so incredibly happy.
3233280	3239560	You don't even know how many games of Arkon I played, light versus dark, probably in the
3239560	3241720	year 83 or later.
3241720	3243520	Stop it, Eddie.
3243520	3248100	Now, did you see, this is also kind of PAC related, did you see the thing that they were
3248100	3249760	talking about in Spore?
3249760	3253760	They're showing off some stuff at DICE also, and one of the demonstrations that they showed
3253760	3262000	were it was, I believe, the Care Bears versus the Klingons.
3262000	3266080	It created the two races and had them battle it out.
3266080	3267080	The Kapla-ster.
3267080	3272620	I can't wait until that game comes out.
3272620	3277360	I'm going to just become a hermit once that game comes out.
3277360	3278360	You'll have your game.
3278360	3279360	I'll have Arkon.
3279360	3281480	Jamie will have Cookie Mama on the Wii.
3281480	3282480	We're all happy.
3282480	3283480	No, you know what?
3283480	3285200	The whole PC days is on the DS.
3285200	3288080	They could do Return to Zork.
3288080	3289080	Zork is awesome.
3289080	3291640	Only the nerdiest of the nerds, because that would work perfectly on DS.
3291640	3295080	We found a 404 page that was the first Zork.
3295080	3297120	Yeah, the text game?
3297120	3298120	Yeah.
3298120	3299120	Oh, by the way.
3299120	3300120	Oh, good point.
3300120	3301920	Rob D in chat says Jamie will have Rondo of Blood.
3301920	3304120	Yes, I will have Rondo of Blood.
3304120	3306840	I have to talk about Rondo of Blood every five seconds, by the way.
3306840	3309320	Cookie Mama did get pushed up into March.
3309320	3312520	It originally was in April, so it's coming out sooner.
3312520	3314120	It's going to be out before my birthday.
3314120	3317960	Do you know that Eddie actually told me about a fantasy he had once?
3317960	3323260	Eddie's fantasy was that he actually gets eaten by a grue.
3323260	3326800	If you get that joke, you're awesome.
3326800	3327800	Turn out the lights, Rob.
3327800	3328800	Give me five.
3328800	3329800	You're a winner.
3329800	3332560	That's right, because the lights have to be off.
3332560	3335400	We're all getting eaten by a grue.
3335400	3337780	That's not a grue.
3337780	3341680	Why don't you stab the innkeeper?
3341680	3342680	The sheriff will come.
3342680	3343680	Here you go.
3343680	3344680	Here's your grue.
3344680	3345680	Stop it.
3345680	3346680	I found you a grue.
3346680	3351880	I am Morpheus.
3351880	3353560	This show makes me happy.
3353560	3356120	I love this.
3356120	3357120	It is pitch black.
3357120	3359840	You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
3359840	3360840	Good times.
3360840	3361840	Wouldn't that work?
3361840	3364440	Because I looked on the internet, it's only 95 megabytes, so they could totally have that
3364440	3365440	on the DS.
3365440	3368640	If you want to look that up on Wikipedia, by the way, that's G-R-U-E.
3368640	3369640	Do your homework, kids.
3369640	3370640	What is a grue?
3370640	3374440	A grue is a sinister looking presence in the dark places of the earth.
3374440	3378200	Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear
3378200	3379260	of light.
3379260	3382680	No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
3382680	3384480	to tell the tale.
3384480	3385480	Grue.
3385480	3391160	Actually, I read somewhere in an M. Night Shyamalan film that grues hang out with scrunts,
3391160	3392160	actually.
3392160	3393160	You're a scrunt.
3393160	3394160	On the weekend.
3394160	3395160	Rob's a scrunty bitch.
3395160	3398160	Rob's the scruntiest person in the room.
3398160	3400160	You dirty scrunt.
3400160	3401720	What?
3401720	3403800	Back to console news, DarkSakura.
3403800	3404800	What?
3404800	3405800	Grue, you scrunch.
3405800	3408440	I'm busy looking at pictures of Captain America.
3408440	3412440	I mean, we're on to a blood.
3412440	3413440	I'll steal your story.
3413440	3414440	Okay, Sega Sammy.
3414440	3415440	Oh.
3415440	3416440	Oh, Sega.
3416440	3417440	Sega, Sega.
3417440	3418440	Ah!
3418440	3419440	What?
3419440	3420440	Oh, my God.
3420440	3421440	What?
3421440	3422440	That.
3422440	3423440	That what?
3423440	3424440	I can't see.
3424440	3425440	It's an upcoming story.
3425440	3426440	Okay.
3426440	3427440	She-Man.
3427440	3428440	Sega!
3428440	3429440	How the mighty have fallen.
3429440	3430440	Shut up.
3430440	3431440	Saturn.
3431440	3432440	Sega, Saturn.
3432440	3433440	No, anyway.
3433440	3434440	Kill me.
3434440	3435440	Okay.
3435440	3442120	After the show, though, we need you to set up the thing.
3442120	3453240	Anyway, Sega Sammy profits have slid 23%, and I blame them for abandoning the Dreamcast.
3453240	3461880	So yeah, their net income went down from $526 million to $409 million.
3461880	3466640	Sales dropped by 4% to $3.35 billion.
3466640	3472440	You could say that their sales flew off course like a poorly controlled Sonic from Sonic
3472440	3475720	the Hedgehog on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3475720	3476720	Wow.
3476720	3480440	And actually, their Pachinko machines are actually becoming a lot less popular than
3480440	3482160	they were, too.
3482160	3484800	And Pachinko is really, really a big thing.
3484800	3488760	GS68 has been spamming the chat room, and usually I don't encourage this, but spamming
3488760	3493660	the chat room with this site, segasucks.net, and I'm looking at it, and it looks like somebody's
3493660	3495280	GeoCities web page.
3495280	3498240	Hey, that's my GeoCities web page.
3498240	3502000	Hey, way to use the center...
3502000	3503000	Let me look at the FAQ.
3503000	3504000	Way to use the center...
3504000	3507080	Or the about page.
3507080	3508080	Center paragraph.
3508080	3509080	See, about this site.
3509080	3512680	The first, last, and only thing Sega fans ever have to say when I try to tell them my
3512680	3517320	site is about stopping companies from ripping gamers off is, ha ha, yes siree, don't you
3517320	3519200	know all companies are just out to make money?
3519200	3520200	Bob, bob, bob.
3520200	3521200	What is the word?
3521200	3522200	Yes siree.
3522200	3523200	I don't know.
3523200	3524200	Yes siree, bob.
3524200	3525200	I was going to say, you have to have the bob at the end.
3525200	3526200	Do we have a new...
3526200	3528480	Loki, you have a new story to talk to us about?
3528480	3529960	Yes, let's talk about Crackdown.
3529960	3530960	Yes siree.
3530960	3537920	Crackdown, one of the most awesome games this week, at least the demo is.
3537920	3541840	It's only going to be, they're only going to have male avatars to play as right now,
3541840	3547160	because apparently they haven't finished the female ones, and I guess the females have
3547160	3552360	a whole new set of animations for bulking up as you progress through the game.
3552360	3556580	Because I remember at E3 you could play as a woman in Crackdown.
3556580	3559240	So maybe download PAX later.
3559240	3563520	What did they not, I mean if the animations were kind of already there, I guess maybe
3563520	3565360	it was all the cut scenes and stuff.
3565360	3570920	Or maybe they didn't have time to put in all the animations of emotional breakdowns and
3570920	3571920	pie baking.
3571920	3572920	Don't forget periods.
3572920	3573920	Oh, and periods.
3573920	3574920	Thank you, Rice Princess.
3574920	3575920	You're welcome.
3575920	3583200	So yeah, if you're looking to play a female character, that won't be happening.
3583200	3586280	But you know what though, Crackdown was one of those games that they said that if later
3586280	3591600	on they wanted to add a new island, a new set of gangs or whatever, they could do that.
3591600	3593040	So I don't see why they wouldn't build that.
3593040	3594040	The woman gang.
3594040	3595640	You know, female avatars later.
3595640	3598400	So you know, it's probably going to be a download pack.
3598400	3602840	We're here to complain you to death.
3602840	3611520	Because you know you have your agility, firearms, explosives, and driving, well they can't level
3611520	3612520	up driving skills.
3612520	3614100	I mean, come on.
3614100	3618200	And so complaining I guess would have to be in there.
3618200	3636920	You
3636920	3640520	are putting me looking forward and Crackdown in the same sentence.
3640520	3644680	Jamie can't give two shits about Crackdown.
3644680	3649200	I can't really, not even with you know, X-Lax.
3649200	3653360	She's constipated when it comes to Crackdown.
3653360	3657680	I would need a colonic, sorry.
3657680	3661720	You know if I lose a little more weight, every time I bend over you're going to see a Crackdown
3661720	3667320	actually.
3667320	3673800	Speaking of things coming out your ass, EGM posted seven rumors in their magazine.
3673800	3677280	I don't know how founded these rumors are or not, but I'm going to share them with you
3677280	3678280	now.
3678280	3679280	These are from issue number 213.
3679280	3683640	Rumor number one we already talked about a little bit earlier in the program.
3683640	3689040	Square has another MMO in the works for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3689040	3692480	It won't be in Vanadiel, but a world from previous FF games.
3692480	3693960	So that could be in tandem with...
3693960	3694960	Is it Ivalis?
3694960	3695960	Maybe.
3695960	3696960	It could be an Ivalis game.
3696960	3697960	Oh my God, that'd be awesome.
3697960	3698960	Because that's great.
3698960	3699960	Or what if it was like Final Fantasy VI MMO?
3699960	3700960	I'm sure a lot of folks have a bone over that.
3700960	3701960	Hot.
3701960	3702960	I would hella play that.
3702960	3705600	Rumor number two is that Tekken 6 got pushed back until 2008.
3705600	3706600	QQ anyway.
3706600	3707600	Sorry, Jamie.
3707600	3708600	Tekken 6, 2008.
3708600	3709600	Bastards!
3709600	3711800	That's just a rumor though.
3711800	3713200	EGM could be full of it.
3713200	3714200	Bastards!
3714200	3715840	That is probably true.
3715840	3720040	Rumor three, Mistwalker is planning a Blue Dragon 2, but only if it does well in the
3720040	3721040	US.
3721040	3724160	A DS spinoff is also possible.
3724160	3728080	Rumor number four is Wipeout will hit the PlayStation 3 in 2007 and it uses the Motor
3728080	3729920	Storm engine.
3729920	3732440	That could be interesting.
3732440	3739080	Rumor number five is my hero, Mizuguchi, is working on a Space Channel 5 follow up.
3739080	3740080	Space Channel 6.
3740080	3741080	No, I'm just kidding.
3741080	3742600	I don't know what it's called, but that would be awesome.
3742600	3747040	It'd be Space Channel 5 2, like MTV2.
3747040	3751400	Rumor number six is there's an Indiana Jones game to hit with a movie in 2008.
3751400	3752400	Duh!
3752400	3753640	Every frickin' big movie gets a game time.
3753640	3756040	We've already seen that at E3.
3756040	3757040	Duh!
3757040	3758040	So, yeah.
3758040	3759040	That's not a rumor.
3759040	3762440	And then lastly, EA is making a Kitty Madden.
3762440	3763440	That's interesting.
3763440	3767840	They already have like an Atari, like the backyard football and stuff that sucks balls,
3767840	3769920	so I mean, they could easily do that.
3769920	3770920	What is a Kitty Madden?
3770920	3771920	Like a Kitty Madden?
3771920	3772920	No.
3772920	3773920	Yes.
3773920	3778000	They're bringing the Puppy Bowl and the Kitty Halftime to the console, as we talked about
3778000	3779000	last week.
3779000	3782720	EA has heard our prayers.
3782720	3784040	Is that what it would sound like?
3784040	3785040	Kinda, yeah.
3785040	3786040	Could we hear that again?
3786040	3787040	Meow, meow, meow.
3787040	3788040	Thank you.
3788040	3789040	You're welcome.
3789040	3790040	Wow.
3790040	3791040	Playing football.
3791040	3796920	Drew Nami says a Space Channel 5-2 was already released, wasn't it?
3796920	3799800	And that's true, but more Space Channel 5 could not be a bad thing.
3799800	3804640	I have Space Channel 5-2, and that gave me fit, because of the whole backwards level.
3804640	3805640	I want pudding.
3805640	3808040	I want more, not like actual pudding, but the character.
3808040	3810680	I told him way to be random.
3810680	3813680	Burr Shaw's one set EA's Linger Abel, 2008.
3813680	3815680	That would be one for the kids.
3815680	3819280	That would be comparison to Kitty Abel.
3819280	3820680	All right, we're going to be taking-
3820680	3822280	Irene does have a point.
3822280	3825640	I would love to see kittens in like little football jerseys.
3825640	3828640	I'm sorry, but that would be as cute as it is.
3828640	3830080	I would probably buy that.
3830080	3831080	You do?
3831080	3832080	All right.
3832080	3834080	Well, we'll see if EA answers your prayers.
3834080	3835080	The game developers.
3835080	3837360	We'll be getting your Skype calls very, very soon.
3837360	3838360	We have a couple more stories.
3838360	3841480	Well, here's a bunch of no shit, Sherlock.
3841480	3848800	Yeah, the Wii has outsold the PS3 by a mere three to one ratio in January in Japan.
3848800	3850760	Take that, bitches.
3850760	3853520	Yeah, like I said, a bunch of no shit there.
3853520	3858840	I remember, actually one of my coworkers was asking me, he read an article that some PlayStation
3858840	3867440	rep or someone at Sony was claiming that the PS3 was outselling the Wii and the DS combined
3867440	3868440	in Japan.
3868440	3872000	It didn't make our show roll tonight because there was a lot of news, but there was a pretty
3872000	3877160	well-circulated story out there that somebody from Sony Computer Europe said something like,
3877160	3882760	if you can find a PlayStation 3 out there on store shelves, I'll give you $1,200 or
3882760	3883760	something like that.
3883760	3888000	Then they promptly proceeded to show four of them at the same place?
3888000	3889160	Yeah, yeah.
3889160	3893520	As I saw a bunch of them at GameStop today, wow, I could have made $12,000, but I don't
3893520	3894520	think he was serious.
3894520	3901400	See, if they're selling at a three to one ratio, so basically they're selling, okay,
3901400	3902400	the system's what?
3902400	3904440	Let's just round up to $300, right?
3904440	3908700	So they're making $900 for every $600 that Sony makes.
3908700	3917440	They're already beating them by $300 per system, not per system, but per group sale if you're
3917440	3921100	comparing Nintendo's 3 to Sony's 1.
3921100	3925820	And they're not even accounting if they're doing the high-end system or the low-end system.
3925820	3931420	So even profit-wise, Nintendo's got the head above it because I've actually argued
3931420	3932420	this with some people.
3932420	3937560	They're saying, oh, since Sony's selling for more, they're going to make more money.
3937560	3943600	No, because Nintendo loves us, and supply is doing its damned best to meet demand.
3943600	3945600	Wow, this is great.
3945600	3951200	Jernami sent me a link to this week's Penny Arcade, which actually makes fun of this specific
3951200	3952200	instance as well.
3952200	3957080	It says, in a recent interview, SCEA President Jack Tretton claimed that he would pay a $1,200
3957080	3961200	bounty on any PS3 system that was found on store shelves, and they went around town and
3961200	3965440	proceeded to get two at the Best Buy across the street, one at the Target, and by the
3965440	3968800	end, they'd racked up $13,200.
3968800	3972440	And then it says, when we get the money, we should go get a couple of Wiis.
3972440	3975400	Yeah, if we can find one.
3975400	3979000	Which is, you know what, if you're a Sony fanboy, I'm sorry that we keep picking on
3979000	3982520	you, but it's true, I mean, Wiis are still hard to come by.
3982520	3985680	Keep in mind what I said earlier in part A about the guy who came, dude, I got a Wii
3985680	3989640	today, I actually found one, like, Target got a shipment this morning.
3989640	3993720	It's true, like, Wiis are still kind of hard to come by, and PlayStation 3s or...
3993720	3998120	Yeah, my local blockbuster, like, all the employees there are, like, vying for the Nintendo,
3998120	4000760	and like, I go in, they'll be like, oh my god, I got mine, because they, like, cannot
4000760	4001760	find them.
4001760	4002760	It's crazy.
4002760	4008040	And you know what, once Tactics comes out on PSP, the PSP's gonna outsell the PS3 again.
4008040	4009040	You think?
4009040	4010040	The PSP's gonna outsell the PS3?
4010040	4012040	Yeah, when Tactics comes out, because I'm gonna buy one.
4012040	4014320	You are not a PSP fangirl, in the least.
4014320	4020160	I absolutely am not, like, I could care less, but with this news about Tactics coming onto
4020160	4024280	PSP with the frickin' Dark Knights, woo-hoo, I'm so happy.
4024280	4025280	Did you just come?
4025280	4026280	What was that?
4026280	4027280	A little bit, yeah.
4027280	4032480	But, um, yeah, and then, Castlevania, and then Luminous 2, and yeah, I think I'm gonna
4032480	4033480	have to invest in one.
4033480	4034480	All right.
4034480	4041240	Well, thank you, Jamie, for the Japanese sales report, or should I say, arigato.
4041240	4045400	I did find something completely unrelated, though, and that's someone made Captain America
4045400	4048800	in Smackdown vs. Raw.
4048800	4050600	You're right, that's completely unrelated.
4050600	4052680	I know, but I think it's pretty funny.
4052680	4053680	Low-key.
4053680	4059200	One more story, and then we're gonna go to our Skype line at 877-GAME-OLR.
4059200	4063760	One game that has a character creation mode as well as Mortal Kombat Armageddon, and well,
4063760	4068280	that being the last one that's gonna be on our current-gen consoles, we do have the rumors
4068280	4073520	of Mortal Kombat 8, and they've basically said they're gonna be using the Unreal 3 engine,
4073520	4077880	because everybody and their mother are fucking using the Unreal 3 engine for their games,
4077880	4079280	so great.
4079280	4083880	It's gonna be great-looking, so hurrah.
4083880	4087960	I don't know, no details, really, on the game at all, except that they were supposed to
4087960	4094840	be starting from scratch again, so, whatever that means.
4094840	4101660	Mortal Kombat on the Unreal engine, I mean, is it gonna be like a 3D fighter, or, I don't,
4101660	4105880	because they say it's not gonna be like a fighting-type game like we know today, so,
4105880	4109800	I mean, but I can't help but think of, like, some of those really crappy Mythologies games
4109800	4113020	at Sub-Zero, although the Shallon Monks game wasn't bad.
4113020	4115760	It reminded me of, like, Ninja Turtles.
4115760	4119080	But with Mortal Kombat characters, they should make a game like that, where you could, like,
4119080	4121760	throw Kung Lao's hat as a projectile.
4121760	4123960	What would you want to see in a new Mortal Kombat game?
4123960	4126240	Where could they take the franchise?
4126240	4127880	Oops.
4127880	4135240	Well, I guess we'll open up the Skype line and see what our listeners have to say about
4135240	4136240	that.
4136240	4139440	You can give us a call, just go to orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.
4139440	4142280	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4142280	4144800	Also you can give us a call with the old-fashioned telephone.
4144800	4148680	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4148680	4154240	That's toll-free in the United States and Canada, but not toll-free, sad face, abroad.
4154240	4157680	You'll have to use the Skype line if you're in the UK or Australia, in which case it's
4157680	4158680	probably past your bedtime.
4158680	4159680	Wait.
4159680	4160680	I just want to say.
4160680	4161680	What?
4161680	4163720	They have to use the old-fashioned telephone, like a rotary phone?
4163720	4165720	No, you can use touch tone.
4165720	4166720	That would be acceptable.
4166720	4168000	Or a party line where you call the operator.
4168000	4169000	You could even...
4169000	4170000	Like two cans in a stream?
4170000	4171000	A cellular...
4171000	4172000	Yes.
4172000	4174080	Actually, we're having the Dixie Cups installed this week.
4174080	4178120	That's fascinating, and people will be able to use the two tin cans and a piece of yarn
4178120	4179120	to talk to us soon.
4179120	4180120	Please.
4180120	4181960	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4181960	4182960	Who's this caller?
4182960	4183960	Legend of Zaku.
4183960	4185800	Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.
4185800	4188920	What's on your mind?
4188920	4190200	Just random stuff.
4190200	4191280	Yes, I know.
4191280	4192280	You're full of random stuff tonight.
4192280	4194080	I'm not taking it back, by the way.
4194080	4195840	Zaku, what's on your mind?
4195840	4196840	I meant...
4196840	4202680	Basically, what I meant when I said that was that just like a manager is like a captain
4202680	4206600	on a ship, he's responsible for everyone that runs it.
4206600	4209440	I mean, that's what you're now doing.
4209440	4211040	You have to admit, though, it was a weird...
4211040	4217040	Yeah, but is a responsible captain on a ship going to order his crew to throw their shipment
4217040	4218040	overboard?
4218040	4219040	Hmm?
4219040	4220040	Still...
4220040	4222800	You were doing it as a...
4222800	4227960	Your reference specifically stated that the manager was ordering the employees to sell
4227960	4228960	to me.
4228960	4230960	Isn't that what happened at the Boston Tea Party?
4230960	4232960	Touche.
4232960	4236600	You know what?
4236600	4238480	Think your comparisons through before stating them.
4238480	4241560	I understand what you mean, however your comparison was completely out of place.
4241560	4242560	Can't we just all get along?
4242560	4243560	Can't we just...
4243560	4244560	No!
4244560	4245560	Let's hug.
4245560	4246560	No.
4246560	4247560	Not until you buy me pie.
4247560	4251760	If you changed the tea and touche to a D, it would be douchey.
4251760	4252760	Shut up!
4252760	4254560	Zaku, please, put us back on track.
4254560	4255560	What do you want to talk about?
4255560	4262520	I want to talk about something I saw on YouTube.
4262520	4265640	I swear to God, I'm not fucking with this connection, just like to Jamie.
4265640	4267320	Jamie, are you fucking with this connection?
4267320	4268720	No, I'm watching someone draw Captain America.
4268720	4270040	Zaku, try it one more time.
4270040	4272600	Unfortunately, if you can't get it out clearly, we're going to have to move on.
4272600	4274600	Zaku, what was on your mind?
4274600	4279480	Basically, I'm talking about something I saw right now.
4279480	4280960	Send it in a text message, Zaku.
4280960	4282760	We'll try to get to it later.
4282760	4284680	Sorry, but it's just not coming through.
4284680	4288480	You'll hear it on the playback.
4288480	4289480	That's a bummer.
4289480	4292120	All right, if you want to call us, 877-GAME-OLR.
4292120	4295520	I swear I was not screwing with that call.
4295520	4296520	But I was.
4296520	4297520	Poor Zaku.
4297520	4298960	Send your question over private message, Zaku.
4298960	4299960	I'll take it.
4299960	4300960	All right.
4300960	4301960	Let's go to this call.
4301960	4315680	Hey, Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind, buddy?
4315680	4316680	Well, I recently acquired a laptop.
4316680	4319280	It's a new VAIO, and it has Vista on it.
4319280	4322560	Ah, so it's a brand new laptop, okay.
4322560	4323560	Yeah.
4323560	4327880	Um, I do not like it at all.
4327880	4328880	Really?
4328880	4329880	What's wrong with it?
4329880	4340840	Well, I mean, there are some applications on it that aren't exactly, you know, well,
4340840	4343320	they're smaller applications.
4343320	4350360	One of them, I think, is actually a foreign one called a Bemania DX, and it's kind of
4350360	4352400	like the step mania of B-Mania.
4352400	4353400	Right.
4353400	4355400	That wouldn't work.
4355400	4360320	So, basically, you're upset because a lot of the old games and things you were using
4360320	4364760	on Windows XP won't work on Windows Vista.
4364760	4374360	That and also that, I'm trying to remember, the main reason that I downloaded it, well,
4374360	4380200	one of them was for music creation software, and my sequencer wouldn't work on it.
4380200	4383640	It just performs pretty poor.
4383640	4389760	But it's pretty, I mean, Vista has all those fancy Windows animations and stuff.
4389760	4395520	I mean, the prettiness outweighs the usefulness of the applications, right?
4395520	4398040	No.
4398040	4400880	Do you think Microsoft's going to fix this with time?
4400880	4401880	Yes.
4401880	4406680	I've always said that give it a couple of years, and I'm pretty sure that it will be
4406680	4408000	an awesome application.
4408000	4411280	So what caused you to jump on board the Vista train at this point?
4411280	4414440	Was it just because you had no other choice because you got the new laptop?
4414440	4421320	Yeah, they took the model out that I was going to get.
4421320	4422320	I see.
4422320	4427560	I mean, it's really too bad because it's a great skin, but I can do everything that I'm
4427560	4431520	doing on Vista with an XP.
4431520	4435720	Are you looking forward to any of the gaming that's supposed to be coming out with Vista,
4435720	4440920	such as Halo 2 or any of that stuff?
4440920	4449000	Windows, now that I have a little more powerful Windows machine, because my other two were
4449000	4453520	pretty, they were really, really old.
4453520	4464560	So now that I have something, I got a 2.3 gig processor and two gigs memory.
4464560	4470340	Now you're the cool kid on the block because you have your 2.3 bazillion hertz or whatever
4470340	4475800	it is, and a Windows Vista.
4475800	4479800	So you have the biggest internet penis on the block.
4479800	4480800	I'm down here.
4480800	4481800	There you go.
4481800	4482800	I got you.
4482800	4483800	All right.
4483800	4487280	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4487280	4494920	Also, I'd like to kind of give my opinion on how Konami basically released the same
4494920	4497640	game over and over again, but with new songs.
4497640	4498640	All right.
4498640	4501600	Please, because we've got to keep it moving.
4501600	4507840	Whenever I bought a new BeatMania game, at least, I don't know about DDR, but when I
4507840	4512480	bought a new BeatMania game, I significantly improved.
4512480	4515960	I almost jumped another level up.
4515960	4522660	So I think that new songs are really all that I need to justify a whole new game.
4522660	4528440	Because you have a lot of new songs to kind of practice with and new charts to kind of
4528440	4531320	help you out where the other charts were getting a little stale.
4531320	4532320	Yep.
4532320	4533320	All right.
4533320	4536640	Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for the call.
4536640	4537640	And have a good week.
4537640	4538640	Thanks for calling in.
4538640	4539640	Okay?
4539640	4540640	Bye.
4540640	4541640	All right.
4541640	4542640	Later.
4542640	4543640	Bye.
4543640	4544640	Bye.
4544640	4545640	Later.
4545640	4546640	So he has a huge EP?
4546640	4547640	Yeah, he has a huge EP.
4547640	4551540	It sounded like either he was high or he had the show on in the background and he was listening
4551540	4552540	to it.
4552540	4553540	Because I thought I heard myself.
4553540	4554540	Maybe both.
4554540	4555680	Maybe both.
4555680	4556680	Just kidding.
4556680	4557680	We tease because we love.
4557680	4560200	And he does some other calls.
4560200	4562720	Let's go over here to this call.
4562720	4563720	Hi.
4563720	4564720	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4564720	4565720	Who's this?
4565720	4569000	Hey, it's Saisha here?
4569000	4570000	Hi, Saisha.
4570000	4571000	What's on your mind?
4571000	4573220	Turn down your speakers because we can hear ourselves a little bit.
4573220	4574820	What's on your mind?
4574820	4578260	I can hear it get echo-ing.
4578260	4579280	Oh, sorry.
4579280	4580320	It's echo-ing.
4580320	4582320	That's all right.
4582320	4583320	What's on your mind?
4583320	4586520	We have a delay too, but that's because it's, you know, our voices are traveling all the
4586520	4587520	way across the Atlantic.
4587520	4591520	So I was just going to ask a question about Final Fantasy 12.
4591520	4594520	Yes, what do you want to know about Final Fantasy 12?
4594520	4603520	I want to know where the story leads to because I look on the internet everywhere and I can't find anything about it and I like spoilers.
4603520	4608520	You want spoilers on the story?
4608520	4610520	Yeah, I'm impatient.
4610520	4613520	I can't tell you that because that would ruin it for our listeners.
4613520	4619520	You could go to GameFAQs.com and there's a bunch of FAQs on how to get through the game or the strategy guide that's available.
4619520	4622520	I'm sure there's places out there where you can get it spoiled.
4622520	4624520	You're just not looking hard enough, buddy.
4624520	4628520	And besides, I haven't beaten it so I couldn't tell you what happens.
4628520	4631520	There was like 50 games that came out in November that I haven't played.
4631520	4632520	You haven't beaten it yet?
4632520	4637520	No, I haven't. I got sucked back into WoW.
4637520	4642520	Oh true, I got back into WoW at level 70 already.
4642520	4649520	Is there anything else you want to ask us about tonight besides the spoilers for Final Fantasy 12 which we're not sharing?
4649520	4652520	Why are you so crazy this evening?
4652520	4655520	I don't know. Why are we crazy this evening?
4655520	4656520	That's my fault.
4656520	4661520	That's partially Eddie and a rice princess being here, but what else? Maybe it's just something in the air.
4661520	4666520	I think that I'm a little bit unable to concentrate quite correctly today.
4666520	4669520	Thanks. You sound really cute and hot.
4669520	4671520	Stop trying to get a date on the show.
4671520	4675520	Well, how am I supposed to date him? You sound sexy. Sorry.
4675520	4678520	Which means he's probably taken.
4678520	4681520	What was I going to say?
4681520	4684520	I've been sick, so I think it kind of affects your brain.
4684520	4688520	Dark Sakura was way this week. You were with Chris this weekend, right?
4688520	4692520	So she was hamming it up with the girlfriends this weekend.
4692520	4697520	And Loki, well, he probably got laid or something right before the show.
4697520	4701520	Oh, yeah, because getting laid makes me crazy.
4701520	4703520	It puts me in a good mood.
4703520	4706520	No, and I didn't get laid right before the show.
4706520	4708520	Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
4708520	4709520	Earlier in the day.
4709520	4711520	All right.
4711520	4714520	Saisha, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much for your phone call.
4714520	4718520	And cheers.
4718520	4719520	Take care.
4719520	4722520	There was too much delay. I couldn't keep it going. I'm sorry, kids.
4722520	4724520	I wanted to say bye, sexy. Thanks a lot.
4724520	4727520	We got it. Say it now. Saisha's listening.
4727520	4728520	Bye, sexy.
4728520	4730520	All right, there you go. You are so weird.
4730520	4732520	You're weird. Your face is weird.
4732520	4736520	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
4736520	4740520	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
4740520	4742520	Oh, hi, this is Judy.
4742520	4743520	Hi, what's on your mind?
4743520	4744520	Hey, Judy.
4744520	4747520	Hey, what's up, sexy pants?
4747520	4752520	What's on your mind, sweetie?
4752520	4762520	I was going to ask you guys if World of Warcraft is really worth it.
4762520	4765520	Wait, we can hardly hear you. What about World of Warcraft?
4765520	4772520	When you want to ask what about World of Warcraft?
4772520	4774520	Is it really worth it?
4774520	4780520	She's actually being eaten by a grew as she's talking to us, which is why she can't stop laughing.
4780520	4782520	It's so worth it.
4782520	4786520	What is World of Warcraft? You're the biggest addict probably out of all of us, right, princess?
4786520	4787520	What do you think?
4787520	4788520	Yeah.
4788520	4790520	You hated all MMOs before World of Warcraft.
4790520	4792520	I did. I absolutely hated them.
4792520	4794520	What sold you on World of Warcraft specifically?
4794520	4796520	Well, I don't know.
4796520	4799520	Wow, that was an awesome answer.
4799520	4802520	Matt gave me the two-week demo-y disk thing, whatever.
4802520	4805520	It's all Matt, our friend. Love you, Matt.
4805520	4808520	And I was like, whatever, I'm bored. I'm not working.
4808520	4813520	Uni hung up. She was embarrassed. Don't be embarrassed. It was fun.
4813520	4815520	And I'm like, okay, I'll give it a try.
4815520	4822520	And I got to level 20 in two days or something, and you can't go past level 20 if you're on the demo thing.
4822520	4825520	And I'm like, aw, man, that sucks. This game's awesome.
4825520	4829520	And so I subscribed to it, and then I signed my life away. It was pretty awesome.
4829520	4835520	By the way, Paradox Vincent, who I accused of being high earlier, sent me a message that said, no, you're a towel.
4835520	4839520	Get it? The towel. Forget it.
4839520	4843520	DJ Tyrant wants to know, Rice Princess, what level are you?
4843520	4846520	I don't have any 60s, and I've been playing for two years.
4846520	4848520	But you're a twink. It's because you're a twink, right?
4848520	4852520	I have many twinks. I have a lot of PVP twinks.
4852520	4855520	Warsong Goldshow for life, 111.
4855520	4861520	My highest level tune is a 38 Warlock on Trollbane.
4861520	4866520	Uni, I bet you any of the WoW players would be glad to hook you up with a free demo of WoW,
4866520	4869520	because they do that thing where you can download a demo on WorldOfWarcraft.com.
4869520	4874520	So you know what? It's like the whole Xbox 360 strategy, demos, try before you buy.
4874520	4876520	And I think that's the best way to figure it out.
4876520	4878520	Ooh, girl, and I'll play it with you.
4878520	4880520	I'll show you around, girl.
4880520	4885520	It's the girls' club on Warcraft.
4885520	4889520	Here it is, Uni says the classic, it's just that I want a Blood Elf.
4889520	4891520	Blood Elves are hot, dude.
4891520	4893520	I want a Blood Elf in my bed.
4893520	4897520	I love Black Boy. Black Boy says, okay, WoW has twinks.
4897520	4899520	Can you explain what a twink is?
4899520	4901520	Not the gay twink.
4901520	4904520	Not the gay porn kind of twink, and if you don't know what that is, you're fine.
4904520	4909520	What is a twink in WoW, Bryce Princess? Where does the name come from?
4909520	4915520	A twink in WoW is someone that has the best possible gear, the best enchants,
4915520	4918520	the best everything that you can have at that level.
4918520	4922520	And it helps if they have blonde hair, and they're usually Russian.
4922520	4925520	You're terrible, Ron.
4925520	4929520	So I have a lot of twinks, and it's easy for me because I'm a girl,
4929520	4932520	and I say, hi, I'll be your Internet girlfriend, give me gold.
4932520	4934520	And they're like, okay, that's pretty cool.
4934520	4937520	I'm like, sweet, I have a twink now, bye.
4937520	4939520	Nice knowing you.
4939520	4942520	No, I'm not really like that all the time.
4942520	4945520	But yeah, that's what a twink is.
4945520	4948520	That was educational.
4948520	4950520	I'm not going to explain what a gay twink is.
4950520	4953520	Look it up on Wikipedia.
4953520	4955520	Isn't that so cool?
4955520	4960520	Or you could be a guy and just have a really high-pitched voice and be like, hi.
4960520	4962520	Actually, they have a Valentine's Day event going on right now.
4962520	4963520	They do.
4963520	4968520	I was trying to have my girl hit on other girls, but I didn't, nah.
4968520	4969520	You were trying to be a lesbian?
4969520	4971520	Yeah, that's fun. Lesbians are fun.
4971520	4974520	Yeah, you're supposed to hit on guys, and they'll give you money.
4974520	4976520	Actually, no, I ended up hitting on guys because I screwed up.
4976520	4980520	I got the wrong thing, so I just decided to play it straight.
4980520	4982520	But you don't actually hit on other characters.
4982520	4984520	You hit on other NPCs is the way it works.
4984520	4986520	Yeah, I know, with the hearts on their heads.
4986520	4987520	Are we really talking about well?
4987520	4988520	I can't believe it.
4988520	4989520	Please, let's go to another call.
4989520	4990520	Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4990520	4994520	What do you want to talk about besides Warcraft?
4994520	4997520	How about BeatMania and virtual console games?
4997520	4998520	First off, who is this?
4998520	5000520	Who said you could call?
5000520	5002520	I paid Loki five bucks.
5002520	5004520	Oh, it must be DMN. Hi, DMN. What's on your mind?
5004520	5007520	I'm doing pretty good. You guys were talking about...
5007520	5010520	Wait, DMN, you've been a long-time listener to the show, right?
5010520	5011520	Yeah.
5011520	5013520	Is tonight a good show or a bad show? Be honest.
5013520	5016520	God, the show's hilarious. What are you talking about?
5016520	5017520	Awesome. Winner.
5017520	5019520	Yay, the winner is me.
5019520	5020520	Heart!
5020520	5021520	Level up.
5021520	5023520	We're listening to the one-day show for a second.
5023520	5025520	Wow, sorry, I just gained five stamina.
5025520	5029520	I'm sorry, you want BeatMania, Wii, what?
5029520	5030520	What's one to pole smoking?
5030520	5034520	Well, you guys were talking about the BeatMania location test in Illinois.
5034520	5044520	I'm almost wondering if that's a precursor to the oft-rumored, talked-about BeatMania sequel coming to the consoles.
5044520	5048520	You know, but we didn't see it at Gamers' Day, which is a little bit of a...
5048520	5053520	It's not going to happen, but it is a little bit of a frowny face next to the idea,
5053520	5056520	because they did announce BeatMania 1 at Gamers' Day last year,
5056520	5059520	so I would say it's still up in the air.
5059520	5064520	No, I'm not familiar with Gamers' Day. Did they announce SupernovaCS?
5064520	5067520	Oh, well, we only ran about four stories on Gamers' Day on the site,
5067520	5070520	so I urge you to check out wordslouchradio.com.
5070520	5072520	Yeah, look at the website, kids.
5072520	5074520	What, did you want to know about Gamers' Day?
5074520	5078520	Yeah, was SupernovaCS announced last year?
5078520	5082520	I don't remember. Actually, it may not have been.
5082520	5085520	You may have me there. I don't think they did announce it.
5085520	5092520	I think they were showing BeatMania last year, and it was the karaoke revolution country.
5092520	5094520	They didn't show Supernova till E3.
5094520	5097520	But they had the arcade machine there, and they announced Supernova for the console.
5097520	5101520	That's right. They made the announcement of Supernova in the arcades at Gamers' Day last year.
5101520	5103520	No, they said the consoles too, I think.
5103520	5107520	Oh, yeah, and they said it was going to come to consoles, but they just didn't sew the playable game.
5107520	5111520	That's right, because Loki and I were tooting our own horn here.
5111520	5114520	Some of the first people in the country to play DDR Supernova. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5114520	5116520	You didn't have to do the arm gestures, Ross.
5116520	5118520	Who wants to judge me? Who wants to judge me?
5118520	5119520	You look like you're trying to fly away.
5119520	5121520	How about with a steel-toed boot?
5121520	5125520	I wouldn't wash that hand, by the way.
5125520	5128520	Ew.
5128520	5133520	Sephirot1215 says the last consumer DDR shown at Gamers' Day was extreme.
5133520	5135520	Okay, there you go.
5135520	5142520	Now, going back, I know Eddie was talking about how virtual console games are priced so expensively.
5142520	5143520	He sure was.
5143520	5151520	I could have put that on the N64 games. I think $10 is stupid, especially since that system blew.
5151520	5155520	Pokemon Snap, motherfucker. I'd pay $10 for that.
5155520	5160520	About a year ago, they were announcing they were considering maybe having all the NES games be free,
5160520	5162520	and I mean, I don't see why that would have been out of the question.
5162520	5165520	I mean, like you said, the games were like 20 years old.
5165520	5167520	They made their money off of them, and now it's like they're selling bits.
5167520	5171520	And I could go buy Animal Crossing and get half those games for free.
5171520	5178520	Yeah, but I honestly think that $8 for SNES games is a pretty fair price.
5178520	5181520	I mean, I'd gladly pay $8 for Link.
5181520	5182520	Eddie disagrees.
5182520	5183520	Why do you disagree?
5183520	5184520	I disagree, too.
5184520	5186520	Why? Because you guys are poor.
5186520	5187520	In part, yes.
5187520	5189520	No, I mean, it's just the whole thing.
5189520	5192520	I understand they have to pay for setting up for the virtual console,
5192520	5196520	but they don't have to pay for actually making cartridges, sending them out, shipping them out.
5196520	5201520	What if they charge one fee for access to the system?
5201520	5206520	Let's say you had to pay $20 for Super Nintendo, and then you paid $2 for each game.
5206520	5207520	Would you go for that?
5207520	5208520	No.
5208520	5209520	No.
5209520	5211520	Because you don't want to pay anything because you're a cheap, cheap whore.
5211520	5213520	Well, I mean, obviously I don't want to pay for shit.
5213520	5215520	That's why I get all this free gold, and wow.
5215520	5219520	But I just don't think you should have to pay for it.
5219520	5223520	Obviously, we're just playing the games for retro reasons or whatever.
5223520	5225520	It's not like we really want to obtain the game.
5225520	5229520	And also, Nintendo's trying to target that new generation.
5229520	5233520	Half of the people who may be playing the Wii have never even played these games before.
5233520	5235520	True.
5235520	5238520	It doesn't mean they have to charge so much fucking money for it.
5238520	5244520	Actually, though, I notice a lot of people that are getting into the Wii kind of remember the old NES,
5244520	5246520	like the old Mario Brothers and that stuff.
5246520	5249520	So I think there's a certain nostalgia value to it, too.
5249520	5256520	But I don't think there's going to be a lot of people that go, you know, OMG, it's Superstar Soldier,
5256520	5259520	because a lot of people probably don't remember that game unless you're hardcore gaming.
5259520	5263520	I mean, I'm not going to be holding my breath on virtual console games coming out,
5263520	5267520	but it'll be a nice thing to have if I see, oh, look, this game.
5267520	5271520	Okay, I haven't played this, and I've been interested in playing it.
5271520	5273520	Bam, I'll download it.
5273520	5276520	All right, DMN, anything else for our listeners?
5276520	5280520	SSJ100, Matt's going to be on STFU this week. That's about it.
5280520	5282520	That should be fun.
5282520	5284520	STFU Thursday nights right here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5284520	5286520	Hey, I heard Jimmy was on cross platform this week.
5286520	5289520	I heard. He didn't tell me until like a couple days ago.
5289520	5296520	How is it that you guys have accomplished more in like 11, 12 weeks of your program than we've accomplished in five years?
5296520	5300520	We model your work ethic.
5300520	5302520	Dear DMN, I hate you. Love, Rob.
5302520	5304520	No, no, you don't.
5304520	5306520	You're right, I don't. Hugs and kisses, DMN.
5306520	5308520	Don't be a deck.
5308520	5310520	Hey, take care.
5310520	5312520	All right.
5312520	5318520	So, you know, I'm going to make a show that counters STFU, and it's going to be called DIAF.
5318520	5319520	Diet of Fire?
5319520	5320520	Yeah.
5320520	5321520	That'd be good.
5321520	5323520	And it's just going to be setting people on fire.
5323520	5324520	Good times.
5324520	5326520	Last minute stories. Let's go around and get the last minute stories.
5326520	5327520	Anybody have anything they want to share?
5327520	5328520	I do.
5328520	5329520	Okay, yes, Dark Sakura.
5329520	5332520	Wand of Blood.
5332520	5336520	Dark Sakura will not be seen on next week's program, or any program afterwards, actually.
5336520	5339520	Because she'll be playing Wand of Blood. Gosh.
5339520	5341520	Actually, I did have something, though, off topic.
5341520	5345520	I'm actually not going to be able to be live Tuesday, but the Tuesday after I will be.
5345520	5346520	Sweet.
5346520	5347520	I have my midterms.
5347520	5348520	More Pump Up the Volume goodness.
5348520	5351520	Yep, Pump Up the Volume will be back the week after next.
5351520	5352520	Awesome.
5352520	5354520	Loki, you have anything last minute?
5354520	5355520	No.
5355520	5357520	Wow, nothing. That's a first. Amazing.
5357520	5360520	Well, I don't have anything either, so I guess that's it.
5360520	5363520	That's another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Down the Crapper.
5363520	5367520	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.
5367520	5368520	You guys rock.
5368520	5370520	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5370520	5372520	We'll start off with our special guest tonight.
5372520	5373520	Thank you guys so much for being here.
5373520	5378520	Rice Princess, your final thought.
5378520	5380520	That was a queef, not a fart.
5380520	5382520	Okay, thank you for clarifying.
5382520	5383520	Wow.
5383520	5385520	Casper the Gay, also known as Eddie.
5385520	5386520	Your final thought.
5386520	5392520	Yeah, don't join Rob's face site thing. Join my MySpace at W-I-I-D-D-Y.
5392520	5394520	What?
5394520	5395520	Nothing.
5395520	5398520	Oh, we, I get it. We D.
5398520	5400520	I get it because like Eddie, but we.
5400520	5403520	Also, I'm really gay.
5403520	5404520	That was Rob.
5404520	5407520	Loki, your final thought. What are you shopping for on eBay right now?
