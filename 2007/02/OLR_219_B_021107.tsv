86041	86921	I blame you.
87241	89162	DarkSakura is going to rescue us with some gaming news.
89342	89922	I don't want to.
90182	90662	You must.
91282	91502	Help.
91822	93003	Okay, how about this?
93063	94183	It's movie news.
94443	95324	Well, that works.
96004	98445	As long as it's not Uwe Boll.
98625	99825	Shut up!
101185	103426	Yeah, it's going to be one of those shows tonight.
103926	104166	Rob.
105027	105267	What?
105427	105627	Rob.
106567	106847	What?
108688	108808	Rob.
111233	111653	I quit.
112674	113474	Good, my show now.
113814	115835	Hi, you're listening to Jamie Lounge Radio.
116015	116175	No.
117115	117735	Did you hear that?
117795	119876	That's the sound of a thousand people unsubscribing.
119916	120316	There you go.
120576	120996	You know what?
121016	123477	That's the sound of my finger raised in tribute to you.
123697	124438	Video game news.
124478	125678	Do we ever do it on this program?
125738	128559	Sony is making a Metal Gear movie.
129539	133901	Produced by, was it the one who's producing the Ghost Rider movie?
135447	136647	That is very cool stuff.
137188	142210	But it was actually announced by Studio Kojima at last E3.
143170	158336	And basically, as far as what's been quoted, is that it's going to be a very... Okay, this makes no sense.
162577	164098	Now they're talking about...
164873	166094	Rob, whatever.
166174	166974	Don't make me feel worse.
167014	167154	Anyway.
195781	198403	But yeah, I'm actually voting for the write-in sequel.
199764	200785	The write-in sequel?
200925	201145	Yeah.
202466	202686	What?
203207	203787	UFO ending?
203887	204107	What?
205849	206149	No.
207510	208030	Dog ending?
208111	212054	No, that's the Silent Hill movie, not Metal Gear.
214175	219780	So does that mean we're going to speculate about who's going to be playing all of the roles in the movie?
221348	227412	Well, Garsh, Rice Princess, if you were to cast the Metal Gear Solid movie, who would you cast in the role of Snake?
229293	229853	A snake?
231874	238738	No, I would cast, um... Dude, why can I not be... Matt Damon, because he plays everybody.
238938	239639	Or Ben Affleck.
239899	240799	Matt Damon!
242080	248664	Ben Affleck, because apparently people think that he's such a universal actor that he can play any role ever.
248684	248904	Ever.
250045	251486	No, I know who I want it to be.
251926	253246	The guy who's his voice actor.
253926	254567	David Tennant?
254987	255727	No, David Hader.
257028	257168	Ah.
258348	261129	Yeah, okay, I'm pulling up pictures of him and he's actually really cute.
261709	263330	And he would actually make a good snake.
263990	264570	See, here he is.
266571	269312	As long as Loki plays... I'm going to send it to the chat room.
269612	271812	As long as Loki plays the role of Tingle.
272353	274093	That's according to GS68.
275154	276274	Well, no, because keep in mind...
277732	282894	Actually, David Hayter wrote the first two X-Men movies, but he was also Solid Snake's voice actor.
282934	286255	Plus, he's pretty freaking... He looks kind of like Snake, too.
286796	288056	DJ Janai wins.
288116	290777	He says Paul Reubens should play Snake.
290797	298580	Yeah, apparently it's a Hollywood reporter saying that Columbia Pictures is now currently negotiating the rights to Metal Gear Solid.
298740	303482	Columbia is owned by Sony, so not a big surprise there.
304302	304542	Anyways.
305577	314360	What is kind of a big surprise though is Rockstar's brand new game Manhunt 2 is coming to the Wii as well as PlayStation 2 and PSP.
315040	333026	For those who didn't play Manhunt 1, in Manhunt you actually play a psychopathic killer who is basically egged on to kill people in very violent ways using everything from trash bags to shards of glass and
334073	337294	Well, I guess we will actually get a murder simulator.
337614	337954	Awesome.
338194	340254	Which is awesome, and it's going to be very violent.
340314	342615	Wait, so you can use a trash bag to kill someone?
342655	346356	Yes, and it's great because you can use... Let's demonstrate in studio how that's done.
346796	348576	Irene, if you would just sit still for a minute.
351997	353197	Just kidding.
353217	356578	We here at Orange Launch Radio do not endorse the actual killing of actual people.
356778	359759	And then, of course, this got announced on February 6th.
361061	377964	Which just so happened, ironically enough, and I'm sure this is just pure coincidence, happened to be the anniversary of apparently a murder that was sought to be blamed on the original Manhunt game, apparently.
379585	385986	There was a 2004 incident where a kid, Steven, I don't even...
386513	391094	DarkSakura, age 14, was murdered by his friend, Warren LeBlanc, age 17.
392434	398395	And, of course, they blamed the actions on the game, which was later disproved in court.
398615	403336	But parents, either way, are still kind of pissed off that they made this announcement on the anniversary of that.
405256	405816	Hooray!
406196	406936	More murder game!
407197	407817	I love this.
407977	409257	And fuck those parents.
409277	411697	Those parents are just jealous that they didn't make it first.
412157	412877	So, you know what?
413718	414678	Manhunt 2, hell yes.
415578	415838	Wow.
416861	441108	I apologize if I mispronounce this name Kai Hate Wireless says Manhunt 2 will get Wii recalls at Walmarts and Targets nationwide Mike W says murder games suck Raven's Dolphin says Manhunt for the Wii for the win FTW well we shall see is Manhunt 2 a game that interests you?
442213	452395	DarkSakura, because you said earlier in the program you want games with more blood and more violence, and I don't know, killing people with a trash bag with your Wiimote, that's... I think that that would be a very interesting... Is that a game that appeals to women?
452695	456576	I think that it should be Ultimate PMS Revenge, the game.
458877	459537	Alright.
459577	462257	She just doesn't like the title because it has man in it.
462778	466698	Well, no, because that could also be women taking revenge off of male oppression.
466718	468039	What if they called it ManCunt?
468139	469499	Would that appeal to you, then?
469844	473166	No, because then I'd start thinking of someone who's pre-op transgendered or something.
473566	474827	Oh, God, I just threw up in my mouth.
479009	483531	Let's switch topics to a Zorro game on the way to the Wii.
483991	489394	Pronto Games is going to be bringing the destiny of Zorro to the Wii this holiday season.
490255	492736	And this was announced by Pronto Games.
492996	498299	Pronto president and creative director Randy Engel said they hope to bring the player, quote,
498649	500450	Fully into the moment of Zorro-ness.
500950	503291	And this game is currently planned as a Wii exclusive.
503331	505673	You know what, I swear to God, that's a quote.
505993	507514	Fully into the moment of Zorro-ness.
507534	508674	Rob, you have killed Irene.
508734	509695	She is laughing to death.
509715	510755	That's what it says.
511416	513136	What would that be, like the 1920s?
513377	520640	You all know that with that Wiimote, you're going to have to do that stupid make a Z with your Wiimote.
520940	523722	How many times in the game do you think you're going to be required to go
526309	527669	I think that's the only point of the game.
527689	528330	That's what you do.
528350	535373	The objective is you try to make the Z. That's the game, and that's how you fully embrace the Zoroness.
535514	544118	Yeah, and at the same time, you can fully embrace the Zeroness for buying the game.
545079	546740	You know, they call him the Gay Blade.
548621	549081	Oh, really?
551282	552983	DJ... It's a new Zoro...
554159	556661	DJ Janai says, Zo, really?
561425	562206	It's like this, Rob.
562266	566990	It's just, it's like... Three snaps in Z formation?
567270	570112	Did Loki just do three snaps in Z formation?
570132	570533	I think that he did.
570993	573135	Flash, flash, flash with the girl.
573815	577278	I give this game two snaps, a twist, and a kiss.
581334	583635	This is the single gayest show we've ever done.
583655	588897	It's so gay that they'll be downloading rainbows.
588977	596080	By the way, if you are listening for the first time and you're like, that's wrong.
596360	597561	I'm going to call GLAAD on these people.
597901	600702	Two of us are gay, so it's okay that we make these jokes.
601422	603343	Me being one of them, Eddie the gay being the other.
605464	607084	Casper the gay, Eddie the gay, whatever.
607104	607584	You're gay.
608085	608765	Gay the gay.
609457	613218	Gay, the gayest gay that ever gayed with his gay blade on the Zorro Gay Game.
613238	615199	Apparently, DT said I just won the internet.
615219	615939	Except for Rob.
616760	620961	Dude, when I ever eat breakfast, I poop out the internet, so don't worry about that.
621742	622962	Have you mastered your gay blade?
625543	627584	Rob has the gay blade, and he bought it at Disneyland.
629064	630585	Let's go back to video game news, shall we?
631845	635887	Before we lose... Tonight, it's how many subscribers can we lose?
637147	638728	Speaking of gay, I'm sorry.
639535	640215	Transformers.
640916	642396	How about some news about Transformers?
643056	648758	There's a Transformers game being put out by Activision on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PS2, and PC.
649038	651159	That's a lot of Ps trying to say that five times fast.
653700	662323	Also, we have the PSP and DS versions that are going to be handled by Savage and Vicarious Visions.
662343	664404	Wait, they're going to be handled by a Savage?
665043	667144	The Transformers are being handled, you know.
667764	673146	I figured if we could have a transforming tape deck, we could have a vibrator Transformer, I don't know.
674006	678827	And that will get me to another topic today, because I actually looked at the Transformers movie poster today and about cried.
680048	682889	Yeah, it's actually being handled by Randy Macho Man Savage.
682909	684489	Oh, yes!
684649	685810	Never do a Transformer!
687550	688571	That was awful!
688991	692092	I love that he plays, you know that he plays Space Ghost's grandfather?
692192	692812	Oh, yes!
693311	694912	on Space Ghost Coast to Coast.
694992	698193	I'll actually be doing the rest of the night as Randy Macho Man Savage.
698333	699034	Oh, yeah!
699434	701054	You can't, no, Rob.
701215	701875	Oh, no!
701895	703035	Oh, no!
703576	705516	Naughty, naughty, cool aide.
705757	707637	So when are you going to start, Rob?
707657	709038	Because that's awful.
711299	712960	So how about Transformers game, huh?
713340	713540	Sure.
714561	728894	The Transformers game you'll be able to either play as an Autobot or Decepticon, and you would have to master each character's weapon moves, transformations, and you'd have to be able to switch between the vehicle and robot mode.
730455	734138	You can tear up the world around you, you can smash shit, and you can blow shit up.
734899	736540	And that makes it an awesome game already.
738582	739543	Traveler's Tales...
740965	746188	By the way, I believe that they are the ones releasing it.
746688	748469	They also had that Lego Star Wars game.
751210	753572	And also had that stupid Bionicle game as well.
753932	755193	But the Lego Star Wars game was fun.
755233	757354	Perhaps Lego Transformers?
760095	764197	I don't know, but I freaking saw that poster today and wanted to cry again.
764217	766679	But I am going to see Ghost Rider.
768339	768860	Anyways...
770007	775431	So the PSP, they just updated the firmware from 3.10 to 3.11.
776372	784859	Adding brand new functionality like a fix to some of the R-Type games and a reset button for the emulator.
785860	794987	And, well, as you might have guessed, as soon as they got it released out there to the world, it was cracked and broken apart and...
795799	799841	Yeah, yet another firmware that's been released by Sony and cracked the same day.
801162	807225	So, hooray, your attempts at foiling homebrew have failed yet again.
808045	808725	I don't even care.
809105	810486	Did you say that this is version 3.1.1?
810726	810486	3.1.1.
810826	819030	I like that song.
821712	824153	Someone cracked our system, down, down.
825299	827000	They took it down, down, down, down.
828161	828441	Sorry.
829842	830162	You know what?
830203	834926	It's one of those shows.
834946	837828	3-1-1, the last three reviews that we've had on the station.
838788	842251	This is the show we're submitting to the podcast Emmys, by the way, just so you know.
844032	846534	Vote for us on Dig and Podcast Alley.
847535	848936	And tell them you loved episode 219.
848976	849016	Um...
854545	856866	Anyhow, Will Wheaton.
856986	857847	Who can save a show?
857867	858867	I love Will Wheaton.
858887	860268	Who doesn't love Will Wheaton?
860788	862229	Oh my God, Will Wheaton is awesome.
862549	868212	Will Wheaton blogged this week on SuicideGirls.com and he was blogging about the arcades.
869053	870033	I urge you to check this out.
870093	871554	It was one of those reminiscing posts.
871854	876097	He's talking about how he loves the arcades and he loved the arcades back in the 80s.
876457	878898	He asked himself, what happens to the arcades?
879218	884181	And he talks about, well, he thinks that because of PC gaming and I can spend 40 bucks to play a game at home.
884520	886081	Why would you spend a dollar on a game now?
886401	890923	But what I thought was most interesting about this is his perspective on what should they do.
891543	904449	And he thought in the last paragraph of his statement here, he thinks that some billionaire should come out and open a chain of classic 1980 videos arcades, complete with the Journey game and Rush on the Jukebox.
905429	907450	More reasons why I love Wil Wheaton, by the way.
907710	908050	Love him.
908611	911612	And that you get five tokens for a dollar.
911977	913197	Hey, and he says, why not?
913417	919799	You had a resurgence of 50s diners in the 80s, so why not a resurgence of classic 80s arcades in the new millennium?
920079	920479	What do you think?
920519	925120	If they opened up like a classic 80s arcade, would you go and would you patronize it?
925780	927600	Yeah, or I could play MAME in my garage.
928660	931401	Well, if they had the Journey game, I wouldn't.
932401	934161	I would be camped out in front of the machine all day.
934181	935142	I would have the high score.
935222	936862	No, the Journey game is awesome.
937583	938504	The Journey game is awesome.
938824	939565	But you know what?
939945	942627	You know where you get to play that is at Classic Gaming Expo.
943087	944948	They need to have, like, food there, too, though.
945049	949512	It would have to be, like, old-school Chuck E. Cheese, you know, back... Isn't that kind of what Dave & Buster's is, though?
950032	950853	Sort of, yeah.
951393	951673	Yeah.
951793	953615	But Dave & Buster's is way damn expensive.
953655	961661	I mean, they have just way too many ticket games there that cost way too much to win prizes that are, you know, okay, more expensive, but still they have to spend more money.
961901	963062	So, I don't know.
963302	965003	Hold on, I have to set the mood here a little bit.
968377	969698	Oh yeah, this shit takes me back.
971799	973920	To the days of Asteroids and Ms.
973980	974601	Pac-Man.
976162	981925	Can you imagine walking into an arcade and you got Journey blasting on the... Man, this takes me back.
984726	985847	You love this song, you know it.
985987	987608	You just don't want to admit it, right, Princess?
988909	989189	Anyhow.
991178	993980	Well, we've welcomed Will Wheaton's opinion onto the program.
994020	995041	How about your opinion?
995321	999464	You guys send us emails every week to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
999924	1002166	And last week we complained we didn't get enough emails.
1002326	1004728	So I think we actually got quite a few more emails this week.
1004748	1005949	So we're very proud of the listeners.
1006989	1008270	We hope we get more next week.
1008290	1009811	So mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
1009831	1010752	You hope we get more.
1010952	1014195	Let's get Dark Sakura to open up the mailbag and read some emails.
1014215	1017417	Thank you.
1020919	1022040	Email, email, email.
1022160	1023541	Checking the email.
1024862	1029385	First one comes from Apollo Chan saying, Hey there, DarkSakura.
1029425	1030246	Oh, it's to me.
1030386	1030666	Wow.
1031346	1033308	I hope all is well with you and the rest of the crew.
1033408	1037690	I was just curious if you or any of the other members of the OLR crew happen to have a Facebook account.
1038451	1043014	If you are not familiar with Facebook, think MySpace except less tacky and more respectable atmosphere.
1043715	1047057	It began as a university-only networking site, but now it's open to everyone.
1047537	1051038	If you all are not members, I would like to suggest that you at least give it a look.
1051098	1054840	Also, there's an OLR Facebook group called Orange Jones Radio Fans, the OLR Army.
1055586	1059728	That I started a while ago and I just thought it might be good to let you all know in case you weren't aware.
1060128	1061529	That way you could better promote it.
1061769	1063970	Just another vessel for spreading the OLR gospel.
1064531	1065611	Love, love, love the show.
1065871	1068873	You all make me amazingly happy, so keep up the good work and have a great week.
1068993	1069333	Apollo.
1069633	1069973	P.S.
1070534	1074096	I'm sure you all will be talking about the 2DX testing in Illinois on next week's show.
1074176	1075396	Isn't that super exciting?
1076097	1076497	There you go.
1076537	1078598	You listened to part A. I'm excited.
1079478	1080539	But I don't think it's going to...
1082282	1083562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1102481	1103883	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1121932	1130154	And yeah, it's kind of like Myspace without the page customization and all that weird stuff that brings Myspace to a strange level.
1130415	1133215	But what I think is really interesting is that you update people of your status.
1133656	1138397	So like, for those of you that remember Jonas, aka Explicit, that came onto this program, he's on my friends page.
1138797	1141498	And it told me last night, Jonas is out at a party.
1141838	1145059	And I was like, wow, that's amazing that the internet tells me these things.
1145946	1147127	Amazing what the internet has accomplished.
1147147	1153790	So I think it's awesome that somebody else created this community and that people were already joining it before we even got an email on it.
1153830	1156011	So big hug and kisses to you guys out there.
1156671	1161694	Our next email actually comes from, let me see, from Stacy.
1162509	1167871	Hello, I've been listening to the Orange Lounge station for about a week now, and I have a question about the playlist.
1167931	1172132	It seems that the majority of the songs are from DDR or Beatmania or from other similar games.
1172152	1175733	There were very few, very, very few songs that weren't dance, Eurobeat, etc.
1176093	1180294	Why is it advertised as a station dedicated to video games when it's so biased toward dance-type games?
1180775	1188817	From what I read on the site, I understand that it started out as being a tribute to those kinds of games, but now, aside from the shows, there's very little to distinguish it from the typical dance station.
1189137	1192098	So if this sounds like an attack, it really is, and I'm generally curious about this.
1192711	1194852	I think we just haven't filtered out a lot of the old stuff.
1195713	1197974	That's the majority of the stuff because they were all there before.
1198114	1207178	To be honest, well, we did do a pretty big reshuffle when we went to MP3 Pro about a year and a half ago, but I think that's what's been high-rated.
1207238	1215723	There are other places out there where you can hear just regular gaming music, but I find that a lot of the orchestral gaming music can kind of be like,
1217157	1221319	Not that it's bad or anything, but without the game there, it doesn't make for the most entertaining radio.
1221399	1232083	So we try to keep the music that's in our rotation upbeat a little more, but certainly it could use some help in getting the music buffed up with some other picks that are very upbeat.
1232123	1234904	So certainly we welcome your suggestions on music we could add to the stream.
1234964	1237184	The really bizarre stuff was from me, by the way.
1238365	1244007	Keep in mind, though, we still feel justified in calling ourselves radio dedicated to video gaming because of,
1244500	1245320	Xenia on the ELDDR
1277591	1278211	Hello, LLR.
1278231	1283074	This is my first time writing, and first of all, I want to say that your show is awesome and continue the good work.
1283474	1283934	Smiley.
1284795	1289878	Well, the reason I am writing is because I have a question on a certain Konami game that has piqued my interest as of late.
1290338	1299604	Assuming if Konami's Oz will ever be released in America, I know that the game is about a year and a half old, but I've seen a YouTube video with an English-dubbed French, I think, text version of the game.
1300228	1300969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1324232	1328175	I've always wanted to try out pop and music and other 2DX games besides the English one I own.
1328435	1328935	Period.
1329015	1329415	Thank you.
1330096	1333218	Hopefully you can help me out and thank you for taking the time to read this email.
1333238	1334058	Again, your show rules.
1335199	1335479	Thank you.
1336100	1338742	That was a really big freaking long run up.
1338762	1341463	I'm not trying to poke or anything.
1341563	1343725	That's why no one emails us, DarkSakura.
1344285	1345426	Tell me when I can take a breath.
1345706	1347767	Oz on PlayStation 2 is not going to come out in this country.
1348248	1353211	And I don't think there's a lot that can be done at this point because PlayStation 2 is slowly being phased out.
1353720	1355600	So unfortunately you're probably going to have to import that one.
1357361	1362502	But I don't think it's ever a bad idea to certainly petition the game makers for the games you want to see.
1363162	1364942	Send emails, let them know.
1366643	1372764	I know a company like Konami, they're somewhat out there reading some of the stuff out there on the internet.
1372804	1376225	So I'm not saying you should go on a board and bitch about it, but send emails, they do care.
1376945	1379885	And that goes with any gaming company, not just Konami, any gaming company.
1380625	1383086	Let them know you want to see it here.
1384946	1393833	Well, the next one is actually a link that was sent to us by JeremyTodd1, which I think is actually pretty cool.
1395454	1400238	Apparently, the folks at Xbox Magazine used me's for the staff picture.
1401319	1404101	So they were doing their nod toward Nintendo.
1404241	1413589	And it actually is... If you go to gonintendo.com slash wp-content slash photos slash xbox
1414449	1416230	M-I-I-O-X-M.JPG
1435090	1437313	Why the sudden appearance of me's in the magazine?
1437353	1443381	Is that just furthering that odd affection that Microsoft has for Nintendo right now?
1443802	1446165	They wanted to recreate pictures of themselves.
1447126	1450731	But using your competitors, because essentially Nintendo is still their competitor.
1452230	1460633	because even though Microsoft might have somehow embraced this Wii 60, I mean, it's odd because you see, like, Major Nelson says nice things about the Wii in his blog.
1460973	1465234	Trixie, I've read her thing on Xbox.com, she said nice things about the Wii one point.
1465274	1470956	And, you know, it's kind of like Microsoft kind of has this professional respect for the Wii, but that doesn't seem to be reciprocated by Nintendo.
1471016	1478539	I mean, there might be a respect, but Reggie has flat out said, don't buy a 360, buy more Wii games, you know, essentially, in so many words.
1478919	1481200	So it's just kind of interesting that Microsoft keeps...
1481860	1485381	handing these olive branches over to Nintendo.
1485401	1486861	Like, hey, let's fight Sony together.
1489162	1490602	Weird.
1492522	1495843	I think that maybe they're just trying to screw with the consumer's heads.
1495923	1498984	GS68 in our chatroom says, come on, Reggie, make love, not war.
1500204	1502724	So how about the next email, huh?
1502804	1503344	How about it?
1505245	1510386	Dear OLR, hi guys, DDR Dollar Bill here, and probably changing my name in the future, long story.
1511124	1513604	and Spirit as long as I'm not going to be in the chatroom on Sunday.
1513664	1518005	My crazy self is in Vegas doing some partying with my family and probably a few hundred crazies.
1518145	1518465	Lucky.
1519485	1521306	But I do have one thing I'd like to ask.
1522146	1526647	While I was making my pre-reserve for DDR Universe, I had a glance at the future release's date list.
1527127	1528087	Even took home a copy.
1528307	1529787	It helps knowing friends at GameStop.
1530107	1531247	And so did Guitar Hero 2.
1531367	1538389	Now I know this is most likely will be a port of the PS2, but we had a discussion about the rumor of Guitar Hero having a future release of all 80 songs.
1538909	1540389	True or not, it did get me thinking.
1541101	1545462	Would having music games concentrate on certain genre make them more appealing to the mass market?
1545882	1550123	Would it also make it more interesting for those already addicted to the games themselves?
1550483	1551563	It's just my thought of the week.
1551744	1553644	Anywho, there's my two dollars to the show.
1554064	1556765	I hope you all have fun, and it goes to the chatroom buddies as well.
1556905	1557605	DDR dollar bill.
1557785	1558025	Nope.
1559145	1560586	It won't make them appeal to more people.
1560626	1560926	Know why?
1561026	1562386	Seems to be working for karaoke revolution.
1562966	1563326	Country.
1563486	1563966	No, it sucked.
1564607	1565527	I thought it was pretty cool.
1565567	1566987	I played it, and I don't even like country music.
1568127	1568547	It was awful.
1569588	1570068	I liked it.
1570168	1570768	It was a good game.
1571365	1576847	Then again, I have a huge distaste for country music.
1577467	1587651	I want to say in response to the Guitar Hero 80 songs thing, an emphasis on rumor is that some of the downloadable packs will have some of the Guitar Hero 1 songs in them.
1588071	1598795	But I'll bet you 10 to 1, you would have an easier time seeing the indie label stuff crossover than you would the major label stuff crossover because they're going to have to re-license and all that stuff.
1598835	1600096	I think they would have to.
1600675	1600775	Uh-oh.
1623206	1627028	So I bought an Xbox 360 some months ago and my roommate bought a Wii at launch.
1627448	1637952	We love many of the games on the systems, but I think that it's time I bought myself a good gaming PC to play some games that I've never been able to play before and I have decided to go with Commodore 64.
1638852	1639833	You win the internet.
1639893	1640433	Who is this?
1640593	1641393	You win the internet.
1641833	1642193	You'll see.
1642474	1649216	I understand you know a bit about that particular machine and I was wondering if there's anything you recommend I look for when going out and buying one.
1649516	1650097	Kickstart.
1650237	1651177	Make sure it works.
1652182	1657427	Are there particular cables and things that I need to make sure I get or particular accessories or games that you recommend I look for?
1657967	1670818	I was thinking about how all of the current next-gen consoles offer extra features like media playback and news and weather channels and I realized that the C64 can be used as a musical instrument so it's a good contender for my next game platform.
1671158	1671959	Thanks in advance.
1672099	1674061	Regards, WarriorBob.
1675209	1676510	Ah, you rock, Warrior Bob.
1676930	1680212	You can hook up a Commodore 64 to a television.
1680592	1681252	I'm trying to remember.
1681272	1681893	It's been so long.
1682013	1682913	And I had a monitor.
1683013	1686835	I never hooked up the Commodore 64 to a TV, but I seem to remember the hookups were very similar.
1687135	1690217	Like the video component was almost the exact same between the two.
1690637	1694519	So you might need some type of special converter, though, to actually hook it up to a television.
1695460	1696901	Did you guys have Commodore 64s?
1697201	1698021	I thought Rice Princess did.
1698061	1698842	No, but you know who did?
1699102	1699302	Who?
1699522	1700142	Captain Kirk.
1700642	1701263	Rice Princess.
1701883	1702123	Shut up.
1702143	1702944	You had a Commodore 64, right?
1704139	1705120	Did you ever hooked up to a TV?
1706160	1706361	No.
1706521	1707581	Do you remember if there were special cables?
1707721	1708442	I can't remember.
1709202	1710023	I can't remember either.
1710163	1711043	I know, it's been so long.
1711364	1713025	What about games that you remember on the Commodore 64?
1713085	1714366	Impossible Mission.
1714826	1716507	Dude, Impossible Mission was awesome.
1717284	1718645	What was that game, The Last Ninja?
1718865	1720546	Or Revenge of the Ninja or something?
1720626	1721666	That game was awesome.
1721686	1722887	Revenge of the Ninja was on the Game Boy.
1723667	1725228	I think it's The Last Ninja is what it was called.
1725248	1726769	No, Revenge of the Ninja was on the Sega CD.
1726789	1727570	It was a cinematic game.
1727830	1730271	Lazy Jones was a fun game because it was a bunch of mini games.
1730431	1730911	Lode Runner!
1730971	1731972	It's better than Fusion Frenzy.
1732252	1732872	I can't remember.
1732912	1736574	We had like missions to Mars or something like that or the Mars Zoggers.
1736614	1737675	Pinball Construction Set.
1738135	1739016	That game's awesome too.
1739256	1740156	No, shut up!
1740216	1740837	It's awesome!
1742157	1743578	It does not require a special monitor.
1743598	1744499	It can be plugged into a TV.
1745930	1748072	That's what it says on Wikipedia.
1748452	1752355	I was going to say, though, Kickstart.
1752615	1755277	That is the only game I ever played on the Commodore 64.
1755357	1759160	Is that the one with the button and you kick with the little clown and you kick the balloons around the screen?
1759180	1760882	No, it's a dirt bike racing game.
1760942	1762343	It's very similar to Excitebike.
1762363	1762663	Kickman!
1763364	1764244	Never mind.
1764685	1765986	It's very similar to Excitebike.
1766066	1767487	So, Kickstart.
1767707	1768267	Gotta get that game.
1768388	1768768	It's awesome.
1768788	1768928	Sorry.
1769577	1771318	Winter Games, Bard's Tale.
1771698	1774579	Oh, you know, GameTap has a lot of Commodore 64 games on it.
1774599	1776780	So if you want to try some out, GameTap has a bunch.
1777140	1779582	I'm trying to find the game that I used to play all the time.
1779782	1785004	I thought it was Bard's Tale, but I tried to look it up and all the ones that I came up with did not look anything.
1785144	1785624	What was that game?
1785644	1787125	The Seven Scrolls or whatever that game was?
1787185	1790907	No, all I remember is a miasmal cur from the game.
1790987	1792828	That's the only thing that sticks out in my mind.
1793308	1795929	Well, good luck with your Commodore 64 adventures.
1796169	1798310	And you have to try GEOS at some point.
1799149	1801511	and see the Commodore 64 as a Mac.
1802352	1803073	Oh, God.
1803093	1805615	Dude, the Commodore 64 was awesome.
1806496	1807457	I love the Commodore 64.
1807597	1809358	There's a picture on Wikipedia.
1810419	1815624	Just about any arcade game that was out in the early 80s had a port on the Commodore 64.
1815884	1816344	You name it.
1816424	1819207	Donkey Kong, Kongo Bongo, whatever, it's out there.
1819487	1820588	And Captain Kirk did have one.
1820988	1823230	And there was a Star Trek game on the Commodore 64, you smartass.
1823250	1825692	Yeah, he had one in Star Trek 2.
1826293	1826533	All right.
1827661	1828801	Let us know what Commodore 64 is.
1828841	1834825	In fact, I would urge all our listeners at some point this week, because there is a website where you can play Commodore 64 games.
1834986	1837187	I can't remember what the hell it was.
1839709	1840669	Maybe somebody in chat remembers.
1840689	1844792	There's some site that had nothing but Java, Commodore 64 games.
1844832	1846133	You can play a ton of them online.
1847974	1852678	I urge everyone to play one Commodore 64 game this week and check out the roots of PC gaming.
1853118	1854559	Definitely make it Impossible Missions.
1855276	1859039	Okay, so speaking of the Commodore 64, who had a TI-85?
1859259	1865143	I know what they are, but I didn't have one, because we had a Commodore 64, they were better.
1865743	1867124	I had a Coleco, I had an Atom.
1868545	1870667	And if you had an Apple II, I'm sorry.
1871427	1874169	We had one at my school, and I played a lot of kicks, and that was all I cared about.
1875510	1879313	Somebody in our chatroom, Camara, says Lemon64.com.
1879353	1882195	I've never seen this site, this isn't the same site I use, but it looks like this will work.
1882850	1883510	I think you can do this.
1883530	1883970	I'm going to try it.
1883990	1884771	How about that last email?
1884811	1885511	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1886471	1887992	This comes from Cutie Honey.
1889173	1891213	I just got two things to say this time.
1891373	1895555	I recall a comment at the end of the Sunday show where Rob said that the show needs more gay people.
1896215	1899817	Well, I guess you can count me as the OO Army's first bisexual pleasure to meet you guys.
1899877	1903318	I'm sorry, you've been, you're beaten to that from show one.
1904939	1905179	Sorry.
1906420	1913483	Second, on a completely different note, two weeks ago you guys started a discussion about games that have too many sequels and remakes.
1913943	1919845	In chat, I brought up the fact that DDR had many games, and suddenly a ton of people went crazy.
1920185	1921385	A fun kind of crazy, mind you.
1921785	1922186	Wait, wait, wait.
1922346	1923426	Bisexual male or female?
1924606	1924807	Male.
1925247	1925407	Over 18?
1927307	1927608	Single?
1928128	1928868	Did he attach a picture?
1929328	1929528	No.
1931309	1931729	I'm kidding.
1932827	1935828	Can I finish the email?
1936168	1939188	Sorry, it's Valentine's Day and I'm single.
1940069	1941309	It's not Valentine's Day.
1941969	1943389	Do you know what I'm doing on Valentine's Day?
1943769	1944250	Crocheting?
1944630	1946910	Having my neck adjusted and going to school.
1947630	1947970	Fun.
1948671	1949711	How romantic.
1950331	1951791	Anyway, can I finish reading the email, please?
1951811	1952291	Yes, you may.
1952471	1952892	Okay.
1953752	1954252	Where was I?
1954592	1954792	Oh, yeah.
1956743	1958124	So here's the burning question.
1958144	1963265	Do you think Konami beats a dead horse by releasing several Ben Mani games each year with only different song lists?
1964205	1964585	Excuse me.
1965726	1966666	Blame the orange soda for that.
1967306	1978349	Although I'm not helping the situation by buying every PS2 DDR game that gets released, it's kind of annoying to see some new features like Battle Mode added when you have to ask yourself, why didn't they add it last year?
1979089	1981250	The cheap rational bastard in me would rather...
1982253	1983094	Honey Fresh Honey Fresh
2008826	2013288	You know, I think the Bomani games coming out very similar every year with different solos.
2013308	2014369	Keep in mind, there's new modes.
2014589	2020992	Usually Konami tries to throw something new in it every time, like whether it be the single-player Mission Master or the Hands and Feet or whatever new thing they did.
2021432	2026754	But I would say it's no different than the Madden 06, 07, 08 games that come out, you know?
2027214	2030956	And some people don't get that, just like some people don't get the DDR games that come out every year.
2030996	2037459	I think it's just kind of, if you're into that, then you kind of accept that as part of what the games go through each year with the change, so...
2038035	2039215	That's what I say.
2041056	2044317	With the new songs come new step charts and new challenges, you know?
2044457	2044797	I don't know.
2045658	2053180	But see, from the other perspective, ask somebody who doesn't play DDR as much as I do, and they probably think, it's stupid, it's the same game every time.
2053260	2059242	And that's how some of us, what some of us say about Madden, is that it's roster update 2007.
2059562	2062043	Well, you know, we don't really play those games, so we don't understand.
2062563	2063704	I try not to say that.
2063764	2064664	If I do, it's injustice.
2065606	2070947	Actually, in the beginning with DDR, it used to have a lot of significant changes with each one.
2070967	2080949	I remember with 5th Mix, you had the actual tempo freezes, which was like when you first played, you're like, what the fuck?
2081429	2082349	The song stopped!
2082589	2083749	Someone broke the machine!
2083849	2085549	Oh, it started up again.
2085890	2087130	So that was kind of neat.
2087190	2092951	And then, of course, you had tempo changes in 4th Mix and stuff like that.
2094271	2094431	And
2094909	2096470	Is it a hot gay man?
2096490	2097191	No, it's not.
2097251	2098231	No hot gay man?
2098311	2099412	That was the last email.
2099432	2099892	But a cool one!
2099912	2099993	Yeah.
2124045	2125526	What's your Facebook address, Rob?
2126287	2127468	You don't have addresses on Facebook.
2127488	2131131	You have to look me up by name, but I use my stage name, Rob Roberts, so it's easy to find me on Facebook.
2131872	2132872	Jamie, you should get a Facebook, too.
2132933	2133313	It's kind of fun.
2133333	2134134	Yeah, let's all do that.
2134794	2135315	That's okay.
2136556	2137456	Oh, I got another one, too.
2137516	2137877	Look at this.
2138097	2138797	Oh, I'm popular.
2139298	2139758	Yay.
2140699	2140999	All right.
2141480	2144803	Speaking of popular, you know what game is popular out there?
2145263	2146024	Gears of War.
2146344	2150908	I mean, everyone's got a big heart on over Gears of War, except for me, because I don't really like the game.
2150948	2151648	But anyways...
2153354	2158696	It did win eight awards at the 10th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.
2159196	2161856	And these aren't like achievement points, but, you know, whatever.
2162837	2171859	It did win a bunch of different awards, including Game of the Year, Best Console Game, Best Animation.
2173500	2174240	Let's see here.
2177581	2178861	Among some other ones here.
2179021	2181842	Oh, Best Outstanding Character Performance of a Male.
2183069	2191871	Best Online Gameplay, Best Visual Engineering, and Action Adventure Game of the Year.
2194071	2194892	Surprise!
2195852	2197432	Gears of War wins more awards.
2201773	2202053	What?
2202753	2203914	No, I'm actually with Loki.
2203934	2205634	I mean, eh, I could care less.
2206371	2206691	Why?
2207272	2209333	Well, Gears of War is a phenomenal game.
2209353	2210554	Blah, blah, blah.
2210574	2212035	That's what everybody on the internet says.
2212075	2212595	It must be true.
2212615	2227666	When Halo 3 comes out this year, and even if it isn't as good as Gears of War, and, you know, it could be like half-ass, you know, half as good as Gears of War or whatever, people will still be giving this thing awards and getting a big boner over this game because it's Halo.
2228827	2229207	I don't know.
2230488	2233810	Gears was okay, but, I mean, just, I don't know.
2233830	2236092	It didn't give me the boner it gave the rest of the internet, I guess.
2236843	2240807	Anyhow, this might give a lot of sci-fi fans a boner, though.
2241508	2242709	Eddie, get your hand away from me.
2244871	2253800	According to the Hollywood Reporter, NBC Universal, which is part of Vivendi, they are working on a space combat game.
2253820	2254821	It's like a sim game.
2258266	2260506	Set in the Battlestar Galactica universe.
2260566	2262627	I'm talking the new one, not the old one.
2262727	2264087	Or Galaxy Balactica.
2264527	2268588	Digital download for PC and Xbox Live Arcade.
2269008	2276949	And there's a tie-in, by the way, with Xbox because there's new Battlestar Galactica gamer picks and themes available for low amounts of Microsoft points.
2277009	2279230	Are the characters going to cry their emo tears?
2279850	2281310	Hey, Battlestar Galactica is a pretty good show.
2281330	2282590	I don't know if you've ever actually watched it.
2282630	2283430	It's actually pretty good.
2284050	2285891	It's the Krylons, not the Cylons.
2285951	2286591	Whatever.
2286611	2287471	Stop being uneducated.
2288095	2290798	Oh, it'll be hard for Eddie.
2290998	2291598	I'm kidding.
2292419	2294441	I'm looking forward to seeing what this looks like on Xbox Live.
2294481	2295041	I bet it's fun.
2295422	2297864	I don't care about Xbox, but on PC it's going to be awesome.
2298344	2302928	Well, I have some news that people might care about, but I don't know, not really.
2304450	2306592	Are we have friends at Buena Vista Games?
2306812	2314439	Well, at least, you know, they've always been really, really great at E3 to work with because when Square says, you can't film that, they're like, here, let me play it while you film it.
2315510	2318431	So, but they have renamed themselves.
2319491	2322812	They are now called Disney Interactive Studios.
2324232	2324913	They're dissed.
2326253	2326533	Ha.
2327353	2331034	So they're officially now making their Disney affiliation public.
2331134	2335295	So when we see Kingdom Hearts and the Disney Interactive Studios, we get it.
2335916	2342757	They're still doing non-Disney games too, to every extent extra, which is one of them.
2343838	2344658	But they are
2345638	2348559	Now, officially Disney-oriented.
2348579	2352701	Just like Disney presents the M-rated dinosaur-hunting Turok.
2354121	2355202	Coming out later this year.
2355622	2356322	That should be interesting.
2356362	2357342	Disney's Turok.
2357443	2359463	I wonder if we'll have a theme ride based on that.
2360284	2361224	Maybe we should have a crossover.
2361284	2362104	I would so be on that ride.
2362124	2366386	Because Disney owns ABC as well, so we should have a crossover with the characters from Dinosaur.
2367046	2367746	Not the mama!
2369687	2370067	Awesome.
2370988	2372068	That would be awesome.
2373612	2376254	I hope there's some TGIF fans out there that get my joke.
2377195	2378836	Or I'm going to look stupid as usual.
2380016	2380957	Anyways.
2381797	2383699	Let's give it up for 92, y'all!
2383719	2384999	92 in the house!
2386040	2387781	Well, this might make some people happy.
2388341	2394065	Square Enix confirms a brand new MMO coming to 360 and Vista and possibly the PlayStation 3.
2394765	2399788	But whether it's going to be a sequel to Final Fantasy XI, maybe Final Fantasy XIV, eh?
2399808	2399848	Eh?
2401343	2402443	Final Fantasy XI 2 Final Fantasy XI 2
2430523	2434666	I'm going to crap my pants in eager anticipation.
2434826	2436328	What if it's Chrono Trigger Online?
2436488	2437569	Fuck yeah, I'll play that.
2437609	2438309	There you go.
2438449	2439070	Hell yeah.
2439430	2441932	That's where I'm really going to crap my pants.
2442733	2443553	Ew, that's kind of gross.
2444294	2444514	Wait.
2446055	2448837	What if it's like Saga Frontier Online?
2450198	2450639	Pass.
2450739	2452680	I would be the only person playing it.
2452880	2453541	Probably.
2453861	2456343	It's like, yes, I can farm all the gold.
2457784	2458385	That's it.
2458785	2459386	Okay, we can move on.
2459426	2459886	Yeah.
2461050	2469833	I would play Final Fantasy XI too, because as much crap as I get Final Fantasy XI now, I did waste two and a half years of my life on it, so there must have been something in that game I saw.
2469934	2473495	It was a good game while it lasted, but I'm in full Final Fantasy XI recovery.
2479742	2480002	What?
2480082	2480923	That's gross.
2481003	2481123	No.
2481443	2482905	No, it was actually the people.
2483265	2486067	The over 18 link shell people I had.
2486487	2490070	I got a mighty big link shell here for you.
2490330	2493853	Uni in our chat room is a self-confessed FFXI whore.
2494233	2494693	There you go.
2495414	2495754	I win.
2495814	2497555	I spent four years, says Uni.
2498736	2499497	I feel your pain.
2499717	2500297	I feel your pain.
2501038	2501598	Yeah.
2501678	2503240	Have you ever spent real money on gold?
2505261	2506642	That was the point when I knew I had to quit.
2507203	2509064	When I was contemplating spending real money on gold.
2509850	2513632	Rob, I'm sorry, that's just a little bit too... That's why I quit!
2514173	2517635	Because I said, you know what, no, that's actually... Good for you, Rob.
2517675	2524719	The other reason why I quit is because when I was sitting there for an hour literally doing nothing, waiting for a party, I was like, I can't take this anymore.
2525719	2527721	Waiting for a pretend party in the game?
2529161	2530302	A panty party!
2530742	2531643	That's awesome!
2532526	2533647	I miss Ragnarok when I could be leveling.
2560034	2560675	All right, anyhow.
2560935	2563217	I was looking real quickly since you mentioned buying gold.
2563237	2563678	Uh-huh.
2563918	2566661	And everyone's favorite site to hate, IGE.com.
2566881	2567141	Mm-hmm.
2567862	2574909	They actually have options where you can purchase gold amounts up to 50 million, or at least gil.
2574929	2576631	50 million gil.
2576651	2577611	50 million gil, which is $1,563.50.
2577992	2578833	Who the fuck would spend that money?
2578853	2579073	Oh, my God.
2583883	2585043	No, that's lame.
2585283	2585864	Hey, wait a minute.
2586104	2587224	Whatever happened to our donation?
2587264	2588084	We never spent it, huh?
2588324	2588905	I'm just kidding.
2588925	2589885	You know what, Rob?
2590105	2591906	I am policing that, okay?
2592846	2594827	And we're going to use it to send me to ASIN.
2595267	2596847	Oh, yeah, then I'm policing that now.
2597568	2602649	No, she'll be all like, back me donation, please.
2603089	2605090	Will you please tell the back me wool story to our listeners?
2605110	2605170	Why?
2605686	2606527	Thanks for watching!
2623949	2625530	I don't know if Brad gave it back or not.
2625570	2627950	I thought it was funny because it's a Chinese farmer.
2628251	2629511	There's the inside joke.
2631131	2640315	But you have to understand, now Irene is a hunter character and her pet is, or no, the name of her character is Back Me Wool and the name of the pet is Please.
2641655	2642875	And nobody gets that.
2642995	2643376	I do.
2643776	2646897	And now our listeners will if they ever play on Ravencrest.
2647017	2647937	Yeah.
2647997	2648777	Don't play on Ravencrest.
2650698	2651198	Oh, har.
2652879	2653259	Oh, wow.
2654520	2655721	Trainwreck, Choo Choo
2677833	2683457	You probably have read about this on your favorite blog, but I know some folks here in studio have got to share their stuff on this.
2683837	2687239	Now, there's legislation out there, of course, looking to get stricter penalties on games.
2687259	2690401	Well, GameStop released an internal memo this week.
2690421	2694204	Actually, it was a conference call, and managers were told about a new rule.
2694264	2695385	It's a new strict policy.
2695445	2695885	This is it.
2696525	2703370	If you sell a game, an M-rated game, to an underage customer, you get fired immediately.
2703812	2711358	and if you're the manager of that store, whether you were there or not, you get fired as well for managing such a shitty employee.
2711438	2712859	I'm so glad that Dan quit.
2714480	2715481	What do you think of this policy?
2715501	2717683	I think it's retarded and I'm glad that Dan quit.
2719164	2727390	Well, the manager, I agree that the manager should have better trained the employee, but really it's the employee that should suffer for it.
2727450	2729572	I think that the manager should be written up.
2730552	2731413	I think that's acceptable.
2732932	2733552	What are you going to do?
2733632	2734853	Make me work overtime?
2734973	2739514	I'm just going to sell an M-rated game to a six-year-old and then you're going to get your ass fired.
2739534	2741055	I don't give a shit about this job.
2741535	2742415	Let's go get another one.
2745816	2749157	I think it's retarded because there's no actual law that says you have to do that.
2749237	2750178	But, you know, hey, whatever.
2750198	2751758	That's their store policy, I guess, you know.
2752459	2753779	Just make sure you follow it.
2754599	2755179	But, yeah.
2756500	2756660	Yeah.
2757065	2768274	I remember there was a news thing also where people were doing a sting to see who they can get to sell a six-year-old or whatever.
2769575	2777642	Is that like that Dateline NBC where they trap people on the internet and get them to come over wearing no pants to meet the 12-year-old girl?
2777982	2781685	And then the reporter guy jumps out and says, surprise, I'm from NBC.
2781725	2783006	And the guy's like, I'm so embarrassed.
2785405	2786325	Shadow Next Gen in chat.
2813413	2815375	Thank you, Chat Room, for keeping us on track here.
2815415	2822120	Chat.OrangeLondrainer.com ShadowNextGen says, The policy where managers get fired because of what their employees did is fucked up.
2824381	2826403	I think they're responsible for training the employees properly.
2827123	2832527	And so writing up is not... Yeah, but what if I'm so mad at my manager and I'm going to quit anyway?
2832627	2835690	Like, I'm going to sell a game to fuck my manager over too.
2835730	2836570	That's kind of screwed up.
2836971	2839433	I would hope there's a way to dispute the firing or something.
2840453	2841234	And to be honest...
2841849	2849350	The only way they're going to get in trouble is if the fucking parent, you know, says, Hey, I didn't know this game had that kind of content in it.
2849390	2851611	If you maybe, you know, if you tell the parent or whatever.
2852711	2860012	Or what if, you know, for example, Billy has, you know, his friend's older brother buy the game for him or something like that.
2860292	2865313	And then, you know, gets into Billy's hands and his parents go, Where the fuck did you get this from?
2865573	2867974	Oh, well, the GameStop people sold it to me.
2868354	2870714	And then, you know, now people are getting fired because of that.
2871877	2874878	Legend of Zaku makes a very interesting comparison here.
2874898	2883661	It says, it's only fair, Jamie, just like in Abu Ghraib, where the people who carried out the torture got the hammer, while the folks who ordered it got off scot-free.
2884401	2886402	Remember the Iraq torture thing?
2886422	2891984	Yeah, but the GameStop owners aren't telling them to sell the games.
2893304	2895025	That was really... I'm sorry, that's really...
2895951	2897412	That was the strangest comparison.
2897452	2899734	I mean, no offense to Zaku, because everyone's going to tell their opinion.
2899754	2900495	No offense to Zaku.
2900515	2901235	That was stupid.
2902316	2902596	Wow.
2902616	2903257	I'm sorry.
2903397	2906859	How is that even... Oh, yeah.
2906899	2908260	We want you to sell this game.
2908340	2909381	Oh, and you're fired.
2910522	2913144	What manager's going to do... That's fucking stupid.
2914745	2917567	God, think before you try to make a witty comparison.
2917667	2918208	Thank you.
2918348	2920089	I'm sorry, but that doesn't work.
2921510	2921731	Wow.
2921771	2923632	Yeah, you should be selling more of those stupid...
2924229	2925249	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2955214	2956895	Yeah, um... Cheers.
2958355	2959256	Did you say jizz?
2959396	2960236	No, cheers!
2960957	2962257	I meant like you said jizz.
2962957	2963418	Jizz.
2965278	2967959	And wait, PC gaming like politically correct gaming?
2968020	2970140	No, like a personal computer.
2970341	2977924	Anyway, there's a martial arts MMO called Nine Dragons, and the beta is...
2979122	2981403	Open in, uh, actually opening in Europe.
2981543	2990906	They said that, um, you'll actually be able to play and get double experience until, uh, let's see, actually I'm not finding the date on here is the sad thing.
2991166	2992946	It may be actually open right now.
2993867	2996248	Um, in fact, you can actually apply for the, okay, here it is.
2996268	3003390	You can apply for the beta over on the website, which is 9dragons.acclaim.com slash welcome.htm.
3004978	3008322	and you can keep on going to the site and check out the demo there.
3008342	3013607	But they're doing a double experience push that actually may be over already.
3014928	3016309	By the time I saw this, it was already over.
3017310	3018211	But hey, you can try the game.
3020854	3023417	Dude, I got three more friend requests on Facebook.
3023677	3024417	I'm so popular.
3024438	3025218	Rob, stop gloating.
3027340	3027861	I'm popular.
3028337	3028857	This is great.
3028877	3029818	The internet is awesome.
3029978	3031499	Everybody can be a winner.
3031599	3040143	As I mentioned in Part A, Galactic Civilizations 2 is getting a brand new expansion pack called Dark Avatar.
3041083	3043404	It's actually being released early.
3044845	3050127	And yeah, you can definitely check it out now if you're into that.
3050428	3057511	And it introduces brand new asteroid belts full of resources and unique planets and
3058635	3059435	other fun stuff like that.
3059495	3061656	I don't play civilization, so.
3062176	3062696	But it sounds fun.
3068657	3069517	Sorry, I wasn't listening.
3070017	3072517	Eddie got a text message and was sharing it with everybody.
3072537	3074258	Was it more friends requests?
3074798	3076358	No, it was not a Facebook friend request.
3076378	3077238	I already took care of those.
3078118	3079639	Oh yeah, Dark Avatar, one week early.
3079679	3080039	Good times.
3083879	3084279	I'm sorry.
3084699	3085220	A heart.
3086100	3087100	Can I have a hug, Loki?
3087560	3088020	Can I have a hug?
3088905	3089685	Can I have a hug, Jamie?
3090085	3090766	If you buy me dinner.
3092086	3092426	No.
3093246	3093986	I'll buy you coffee.
3095667	3098148	Decaf, because I know you don't drink caffeine this late.
3100108	3100909	And potato pancakes.
3101509	3102189	I'll think about it.
3102289	3103829	Do I get a hug right now, live on air?
3104129	3104730	Yay!
3106130	3106450	Hold on.
3106490	3108991	Now, I know this isn't TV, but here, I'll put the mic.
3109031	3112832	When I hug Jamie, I'll put the mic kind of at my chest level, so maybe you can hear her boob.
3113528	3115248	The best PC gaming story of 2007 right here.
3143308	3144470	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3159164	3162525	But like when the piece of one... I know you remember, Irene, because you're as big of a nerd as me.
3162585	3168068	For the folks who may not know, Archon was like chess, but like the pieces would actually do battle with each other when you tried to capture another piece.
3168088	3168748	Oh, Battle Chess!
3168988	3173410	No, it's not Battle Chess, because Battle Chess, the animations were already pre-done.
3173690	3175891	You actually had like a real-time fighting thing.
3175911	3177132	This game was also on the NES.
3177192	3178672	They ported it to several platforms.
3179213	3179973	I love Battle Chess.
3180873	3181554	Archon is better.
3181654	3182994	And then there was even Archon 2 and 3.
3183214	3185875	We don't talk about Archon 2 and 3, because Archon was like the best.
3186436	3186936	So, um...
3187270	3188532	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3208476	3211018	That has huge nostalgic value for the right reasons.
3211259	3215483	The gameplay, the great combination of strategic thinking, and the intense arcade action.
3215723	3216424	Okay, seriously?
3216964	3222009	If this game comes to Xbox Live Arcade, I will have died from too much orgasm.
3223431	3223951	Like right now?
3224792	3225412	Yeah, seriously.
3225513	3227675	I'm like... Look at my pants.
3228075	3228656	Look at my pants.
3228676	3229176	They got bigger.
3229256	3229737	No, please don't.
3231418	3231919	I am so...
3232591	3241358	Incredibly happy, you don't even know, like how many games of Archon I played, Light vs. Dark, in the, in the, probably in the year 83, or later.
3241418	3242159	Stop it, Eddie!
3244361	3249205	Now, did you see, this is also kind of PC related, did you see the thing that they were talking about in Spore?
3249625	3260014	Um, they were showing off some stuff at DICE also, and one of the demonstrations that they showed were, um, it was, I believe the Care Bears vs. the Klingons?
3260294	3260895	Ha ha ha!
3261956	3264337	It created the two races and had them battle it out.
3266038	3267519	The Kaplaster!
3270461	3272101	I can't wait until that game comes out.
3272722	3275283	I'm going to just become a hermit once that game comes out.
3277264	3278065	You'll have your game.
3278085	3278985	I'll have Archon.
3279065	3279385	Jamie?
3280006	3281386	Jamie will have Cookie Mama on the Wii.
3281426	3282027	We're all happy.
3282107	3284108	No, you know what they should resurrect from all PC days?
3284728	3286549	On the DS, they could do Return to Zork.
3287785	3289066	Zork is awesome!
3289146	3291547	Only the nerdiest of the nerds, because that would work perfectly on DS.
3291607	3294749	We found a 404 page that was the first Zork.
3295509	3296790	Oh, yeah, the text game?
3296890	3297110	Yeah.
3297971	3299471	Oh, by the way... Oh, good point.
3299491	3301713	Rob D in chat says, Jamie will have Rondo of Blood.
3302093	3304174	Yes, I will have Rondo of Blood.
3304274	3306675	I have to talk about Rondo of Blood every five seconds, by the way.
3306875	3308977	Cookie Mama did get pushed up into March.
3309297	3311998	It originally was in April, so it's coming out sooner.
3312458	3313899	It's gonna be out before my birthday.
3314099	3317121	Do you know that Eddie actually told me about a fantasy he had once?
3317868	3320850	Eddie's fantasy was that he actually gets eaten by a grue.
3323112	3325893	And if you get that joke, you're awesome.
3326654	3327915	Turn out the lights, Rob.
3329676	3330736	Give me five, you're a winner.
3330957	3332398	That's right, because the lights have to be off.
3332478	3334079	We're all getting eaten by grues.
3335219	3336020	That's not a grue.
3337741	3342584	Why don't you stab the innkeeper, and then the sheriff will come.
3344765	3345466	I found you a grue.
3347259	3348241	I am Morpheus.
3351809	3352951	This show makes me happy.
3355276	3355696	I love this.
3356097	3356879	It is pitch black.
3356999	3358262	You are likely to be eaten by a Gru.
3359757	3360317	Good times.
3360558	3364919	Because I looked on the internet, it's only 95 megabytes, so they could totally have that on the DS.
3364999	3368160	If you want to look that up on Wikipedia, by the way, that's G-R-U-E.
3368620	3369300	Do your homework, kids.
3369320	3370120	What is a Gru?
3370460	3373922	The Gru is a sinister-looking presence in the dark places of the Earth.
3374422	3378763	Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light.
3379223	3383424	No Gru has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.
3383444	3385265	Gru.
3385325	3385545	Gru.
3385948	3391993	Actually, I read somewhere in an M. Night Shyamalan film that Groos hang out with scrunts, actually.
3392433	3393294	You're a scrunt.
3395515	3396236	Rob's a scrunny bitch.
3396256	3398137	Rob's the scruntiest person in the room.
3398457	3399498	You dirty scrunt.
3401540	3404082	Back to console news, DarkSakura.
3404602	3405483	What?
3405503	3407584	I'm busy looking at pictures of Captain America.
3408485	3409506	I mean, Rondo of Blood.
3411567	3412608	I'll steal your story.
3412648	3413529	Okay, Sega Sammy.
3414029	3414149	Okay.
3414720	3416702	Oh, Sega, Sega, Sega.
3417963	3418123	Ah!
3418603	3418783	What?
3418803	3419444	Oh my god.
3419944	3420225	What?
3420845	3421305	That.
3421746	3422306	That what?
3422526	3422987	I can't see.
3423267	3424768	It's an upcoming story.
3424888	3425289	Okay.
3425509	3428451	Sega, how the mighty have fallen.
3428591	3428911	Sega!
3429432	3429772	Shut up.
3430413	3431313	Saturn.
3432674	3434376	Sega-ta-san-shiro.
3434596	3435036	No, anyway.
3435757	3436077	Anyway.
3436097	3436457	Kill me!
3437878	3441361	Okay, after the show though, we need you to set up the thing.
3441962	3442282	Anyway.
3442947	3451391	Sega Sammy profits have slid 23% and I blame them for abandoning the Dreamcast.
3453192	3457494	So yeah, their net income went down from $526 million to $409 million.
3457514	3458795	Sales dropped by 4% to $3.35 billion.
3466610	3475151	You could say that their sales flew off course like a poorly controlled Sonic from Sonic the Hedgehog on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3475472	3475912	Wow.
3476472	3481073	And actually, their Pachinko machines are actually becoming a lot less popular than they were, too.
3482073	3484473	And Pachinko is really, really a big thing.
3484733	3495115	GS68 has been spamming the chatroom, and usually I don't encourage this, but spamming the chatroom with this site, SegaSucks.net, and I'm looking at it, and it looks like somebody's Geocities webpage.
3496141	3497882	Hey, that's my Geocities webpage!
3498422	3502383	Hey, way to use... Let me look at the FAQ.
3502403	3505784	Way to use the, like, center, um... Or the about page.
3506644	3507524	The center paragraph.
3507544	3519008	See, about this site, the first, last, and only thing Sega fans ever have to say when I try to tell them my site is about stopping companies from ripping gamers off is, ha ha, yessiree, don't you know all companies are just out to make money?
3519488	3521088	Bob, Bob, Bob, I'm like... Who uses the word yessiree?
3521428	3521808	I don't know.
3522029	3522949	Yessiree, Bob!
3522969	3523649	I was gonna say, yeah.
3524485	3528307	Do we have a new... Loki, you have a new story to talk to us about?
3528468	3530009	Yes, let's talk about Crackdown.
3530089	3530769	Yes, sirree.
3531570	3534772	Crackdown, one of the most awesome games this week.
3535292	3536713	At least the demo is.
3537854	3552183	It's only going to be... They're only going to have male avatars to play as right now, because apparently they haven't finished the female ones, and I guess the females would have a whole new set of animations for bulking up as you progress through the game, so...
3552762	3555383	Don't forget periods So yeah, if you're looking to play a female character
3582280	3583081	That won't be happening.
3583121	3583961	But you know what, though?
3583981	3591364	Crackdown was one of those games that they said that if later on they wanted to add a new island, a new set of gangs or whatever, they could do that.
3591524	3593845	So I don't see why they wouldn't build a woman gang.
3593986	3595486	You know, female avatars later.
3595606	3598227	So, you know, it's probably going to be in Download Pack.
3598268	3602670	We're here to complain you to death!
3602710	3609473	Because, you know, you have your agility, firearms, explosives, and driving.
3609813	3610053	Well...
3610863	3612604	They can't level up driving skills.
3612624	3613404	I mean, come on.
3613964	3616945	And so complaining, I guess, would have to be in there.
3618145	3621686	Bershaz in chat makes the very mature comment, boobie go boom.
3625307	3630068	TheRobD says, well, they thought the driving was enough simulation of being a woman anyway.
3631669	3632589	DarkSakura, comment.
3633009	3634650	Are you looking forward to playing a woman in Crackdown?
3636390	3639811	You are putting me looking forward and Crackdown in the same sentence.
3640609	3642410	Jamie can't give two shits about Crackdown.
3642430	3643050	She just can't.
3644751	3645652	I can't, really.
3646352	3648793	Not even with, you know, X-Lax.
3649093	3651835	She's constipated when it comes to Crackdown.
3653136	3655016	Really, I would need a colonic.
3655317	3655577	Sorry.
3657618	3662140	You know, if I lose a little more weight, every time I bend over, you're going to see a Crackdown, actually.
3665282	3665662	Gross.
3667242	3672604	Speaking of things coming out your ass, EGM posted seven rumors in their magazine.
3673665	3677406	And I don't know how founded these rumors are or not, but I'm going to share them with you now.
3677446	3679407	These are from issue number 213.
3680007	3683069	Rumor number one we already talked about a little bit earlier in the program.
3683389	3688651	Square has another MMO in the works for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3689051	3692312	It won't be in Vanadil, but a world from previous FF games.
3692452	3694013	So that could be in tandem with... Is it Avalos?
3694747	3696067	Maybe, it could be in a Valis game.
3696107	3696988	Oh my god, that'd be awesome.
3697588	3700188	Or, what if it was like Final Fantasy VI MMO?
3700248	3701649	I'm sure a lot of folks have a boner over that.
3701669	3702569	I would hella play that.
3702589	3704970	Rumor two is that Tekken 6 got pushed back until 2008.
3705010	3706970	Cute, cute, anyway.
3707030	3707550	Sorry, Jamie.
3708470	3709031	Tekken 6, 2008.
3709411	3710111	Bastards!
3710711	3711711	That's just a rumor, though.
3711751	3712712	EGM could be full of it.
3712872	3713692	Bastards!
3713712	3714532	But it's probably true.
3715672	3720333	Rumor three, Mistwalker is planning a Blue Dragon 2, but only if it does well in the US.
3720794	3722374	A DS spinoff is also possible.
3723965	3729208	Rumor number four is Wipeout will hit the PlayStation 3 in 2007 and it uses the MotorStorm engine.
3729809	3730569	That could be interesting.
3732270	3737294	Rumor number five is, oh, my hero, Mizuguchi, is working on a Space Channel 5 follow-up.
3738935	3739455	Space Channel 6.
3740156	3740616	No, I'm just kidding.
3740636	3742317	I don't know what it's called, but that would be awesome.
3742557	3746740	It'd be Space Channel 5 2, like MTV 2.
3746900	3750102	Rumor number six is there's an Indiana Jones game to hit with a movie in 2008.
3750142	3750262	Duh!
3750282	3750342	Duh!
3752210	3754111	Every freaking big movie gets a game time.
3754131	3756772	We've already seen that at E3.
3757073	3757453	Duh.
3757513	3758193	That's not a rumor.
3758834	3762275	And then lastly, EA is making a Kitty Madden.
3763156	3763676	That's interesting.
3763696	3769819	They already have an Atari, like the backyard football and stuff that sucks balls, so they could easily do that.
3769859	3770960	What is a Kitty Madden?
3771120	3771841	Kitty Madden?
3771941	3772061	No.
3772821	3778584	Yes, they're bringing the puppy bowl and the kitty halftime to the consoles we talked about last week.
3778864	3780025	EA has heard our prayers.
3780045	3780265	Really?
3782688	3783769	Is that what it would sound like?
3784089	3785190	Kind of, yeah.
3785270	3785930	Could we hear that again?
3786311	3787171	Meow, meow, meow.
3787191	3788112	Thank you, that was great.
3788172	3790754	You're welcome.
3790794	3791194	Wow.
3792896	3793456	Playing football.
3793916	3796739	Drew Nami says Space Channel 5 2 was already leased, wasn't it?
3796879	3799521	And that's true, but more Space Channel 5 could not be a bad thing.
3799921	3804584	I have Space Channel 5 2, and that gave me fit, because of the whole backwards level.
3804724	3805325	I want pudding.
3805925	3808167	I want more, not like actual pudding, but the character.
3808207	3809268	I'm like, way to be random.
3810663	3812685	Bershaw's one said EA's Lingerie Bowl 2008.
3812885	3816409	That would be one for the kids.
3819232	3822255	All right, we're going to be taking... Irene does have a point.
3822375	3825238	I would love to see kittens in, like, little football jerseys.
3825718	3829602	I'm sorry, but that would be... As cute as it is, I would probably buy that.
3832064	3834287	All right, well, we'll see if EA answers your question.
3835140	3837241	We'll be getting your Skype calls very, very soon.
3837301	3838221	We have a couple more stories.
3838461	3840682	Well, here's a bunch of no shit, Sherlock.
3841982	3848264	Yeah, the Wii has outsold the PS3 by a mere 3 to 1 ratio in January in Japan.
3848645	3849885	Take that, bitches!
3851323	3853224	Yeah, like I said, a bunch of no shit there.
3853244	3868272	I do remember, actually one of my coworkers was asking me, he read an article that some PlayStation rep or someone at Sony was claiming that the PS3 was outselling the Wii and the DS combined in Japan.
3868452	3876657	It didn't make our show roll tonight because there was a lot of news, but there was a pretty well-circulated story out there that somebody from Sony Computer Europe said something like,
3877117	3883364	If you can find a PlayStation 3 out there on store shelves, I'll give you $1,200 or something like that.
3883524	3887528	And then they promptly proceeded to show four of them at the same place.
3887768	3888689	Yeah, yeah.
3889110	3890791	As I saw a bunch of them at GameStop today.
3891452	3894375	Wow, I could have made $12,000, but I don't think he was serious.
3895096	3899080	See, if they're selling at a 3-to-1 ratio, so basically...
3900169	3901792	They're making $900 for every $600 that Sony makes.
3901832	3902833	They're already beating them by $300 per system.
3914473	3920415	I mean, not per system, but per group sale if you're comparing Nintendo's 3 to Sony's 1.
3920615	3925296	And they're not even counting if they're doing the high-end system or the low-end system.
3925776	3929517	So even profit-wise, Nintendo's got the head above it.
3929537	3936499	Because some people, I've actually argued this with some people, they're saying, oh, since Sony's selling for more, they're going to make more money.
3937899	3943421	No, because Nintendo loves us and supply is doing its damned best to meet demand.
3943843	3945343	Wow, this is great.
3945564	3951985	Drew Nami sent me a link to this week's Penny Arcade, which actually makes fun of this specific instance as well.
3952005	3959628	It says, in a recent interview, SEA President Jack Tretton claimed that he would pay a $1,200 bounty on any PS3 system that was found on store shelves.
3960028	3964549	And they went around town and proceeded to get two at the Best Buy across the street, one at the Target, da-da-da.
3964849	3966230	And by the end, they'd racked up $13,200.
3967150	3972011	And then it says, when we get the money, we should go get a couple Wii's.
3972592	3973612	Yeah, if we can find one.
3975287	3980631	Which is, you know what, if you're a Sony fanboy, I'm sorry that we keep picking on you, but it's true.
3980691	3982132	I mean, Wii's are still hard to come by.
3982432	3987056	Keep in mind what I said earlier in Part A about the guy who came, dude, I got a Wii today, I actually found one.
3987076	3988737	Like, Target got a shipment this morning.
3989618	3993580	It's true, like, Wii's are still kind of hard to come by, and PlayStation 3s are out there.
3993861	4001146	Yeah, my local Blockbuster, like, all the employees there are, like, vying for the Nintendo, and, like, I go in and they'll be like, oh my god, I got mine, because they, like, cannot find them.
4002142	4002782	It's crazy.
4002802	4003242	And you know what?
4003423	4007984	Once Tactics comes out on PSP, the PSP is going to outsell the PS3 again.
4008004	4008385	You think?
4008565	4009925	The PSP is going to outsell the PS3?
4010145	4011506	Yeah, when Tactics comes out.
4011766	4014107	You are not a PSP fangirl in the least.
4014127	4015588	I absolutely am not.
4015668	4016488	Like, I could care less.
4016688	4023771	But with this news about Tactics coming on to PSP with the frickin' Dark Knights, I'm so happy.
4024191	4025031	Did you just cum?
4025392	4026172	What was that?
4026252	4026912	A little bit.
4027653	4031094	But yeah, and then Castlevania, and then Luminous 2, and...
4031772	4033373	Yeah, I think I'm going to have to invest in one.
4033873	4034113	All right.
4034473	4037194	Well, thank you, Jamie, for the Japanese sales report.
4037595	4040396	Or should I say, arigato.
4041316	4048700	I did find something completely unrelated, though, and that's someone made Captain America in SmackDown vs. Raw.
4049160	4049420	You're right.
4049440	4050420	That's completely unrelated.
4050700	4052121	I know, but I think it's pretty funny.
4052962	4053482	Loki.
4054202	4057143	One more story, and then we're going to go to our Skype line at 877-GAME-OLR.
4058933	4059653	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4084011	4089193	I don't know, no details really on the game at all, except that they were supposed to be starting from scratch again.
4089293	4091454	So, whatever that means.
4094635	4097456	Mortal Kombat on the Unreal Engine?
4097496	4100217	I mean, is it going to be like a 3D fighter?
4101497	4105098	Because they say it's not going to be like a fighting type game like we know today.
4106239	4110420	But I can't help but think of some of those really crappy Mythologies games at Sub-Zero.
4110839	4110939	Oops.
4131087	4135329	Well, I guess we'll open up the Skype line and see what our listeners have to say about that.
4135529	4136330	You can give us a call.
4136770	4139311	Just go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.
4139451	4141732	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4142113	4144854	Also, you can give us a call with the old-fashioned telephone.
4145394	4147676	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4148496	4154159	That's toll-free in the United States and Canada, but not toll-free, sad face, abroad.
4154179	4158681	You'll have to use the Skype line if you're in the UK or Australia, in which case it's probably past your bedtime.
4158961	4159301	Wait.
4159362	4160042	I just want to say, what?
4160714	4163697	They have to use the old-fashioned telephone, like a rotary phone?
4164017	4165598	No, you can use touch-tone.
4165638	4166379	That would be acceptable.
4166399	4168000	Or a party line where you call the operator.
4168020	4170082	Like two cans and a stream?
4170142	4171243	A cellular telephone.
4171624	4173946	Actually, we're having the Dixie Cups installed this week.
4174026	4174886	It's fascinating.
4175307	4178870	And people will be able to use the two tin cans and a piece of yarn to talk to us soon.
4180451	4181833	You're on Orange Lodge Radio.
4181873	4182593	Who's this caller?
4183294	4183894	Legend of Zaku.
4184295	4185676	Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.
4185696	4186417	What's on your mind?
4187638	4187718	Uh...
4188655	4190116	Just random stuff.
4190476	4192316	Yes, I know you're full of random stuff tonight.
4192336	4193777	I'm not taking it back, by the way.
4194537	4195317	Zach, what's on your mind?
4195978	4205661	I meant, basically what I meant when I said that was that, you know, just like a manager is like a captain on a ship, he's responsible for everyone that runs it.
4206681	4208262	I mean, that's pretty much the analogy.
4209402	4211563	You have to admit, though, it was a weird-ass comparison.
4211603	4217445	Yeah, but is a responsible captain on a ship going to order his crew to throw their shipment overboard?
4220895	4229407	You were doing it as though your reference specifically stated that the manager was ordering the employees Isn't that what happened at the Boston Tea Party?
4232932	4233633	Touche.
4233994	4234695	You know what?
4236388	4238470	Thank your comparisons through before stating them.
4238590	4239751	I understand what you mean.
4240111	4242432	However, your comparison was completely off-base.
4242512	4243753	Can't we just all get along?
4244034	4244334	No!
4244574	4245054	Let's hug.
4245074	4246295	Not until you buy me pie.
4246755	4250778	If you changed the T in touche to a D, it'd be douchey.
4251919	4252379	Shut up!
4252699	4254480	Saku, please, put us back on track.
4254500	4255301	What do you want to talk about?
4255741	4255941	What?
4256101	4256242	Huh?
4256262	4257082	What?
4262597	4264438	I swear to God I'm not fucking with this connection.
4265679	4267119	Jamie, are you fucking with this connection?
4267259	4268700	No, I'm watching someone draw Captain America.
4268720	4269961	Zaku, try it one more time.
4270041	4272462	Unfortunately, if you can't get it out clearly, we're going to have to move on.
4272662	4273703	Zaku, what was on your mind?
4279346	4280886	Send it in a text message, Zaku.
4280926	4282247	We'll try to get to it later.
4282847	4284588	Sorry, but it's just not coming through.
4284628	4286109	You'll hear it on the playback.
4288350	4288810	That's a bummer.
4289051	4290351	Alright, if you want to call us, 877-GAME-OLR
4292202	4293903	I swear I was not screwing with that call.
4295404	4297384	Poor Saku.
4297425	4298965	Send your question over private message, Saku.
4299005	4299445	I'll take it.
4300546	4301586	All right, let's go to this call.
4301606	4302527	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
4302547	4302867	Who's this?
4304368	4305588	Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.
4305889	4306789	Hi, Paradox Vincent.
4306809	4307489	What's on your mind, buddy?
4309670	4313772	Well, I recently acquired a laptop.
4315693	4319035	It's a new VAIO, and it had Vista on it.
4319995	4321236	Ah, so it's a brand new laptop.
4321296	4321496	Okay.
4322523	4326505	Yeah, um, do not like it at all.
4327786	4328106	Really?
4328186	4328786	What's wrong with it?
4331068	4342154	Well, I mean, there are some, uh, there are some applications on it that aren't exactly, you know, uh, well, there's smaller applications.
4343294	4351939	One of them, I think, is actually a foreign one called Bimania DX, and it's kind of like the Stepmania of B-Mania.
4352469	4352669	Right.
4352909	4353690	That wouldn't work.
4355190	4362414	And, um... So, basically, you're upset because a lot of the old games and things you were using on Windows XP won't work on Windows Vista.
4364455	4379723	That, and also that, uh... I'm trying to remember... The main reason that I downloaded it, well, one of them was for music creation software, and my sequencer wouldn't work on it.
4379803	4381404	It just performs...
4382401	4382661	I know.
4382721	4382821	No.
4382961	4384842	And, um... Yes.
4384862	4385562	I've always said that, uh...
4404574	4407877	Give it a couple of years and I'm pretty sure that it'll be an awesome application.
4407957	4411179	So what caused you to jump on board the Vista train at this point?
4411219	4413501	Was it just because you had no other choice because you got the new laptop?
4414942	4417624	Yeah, they took the model out that I was going to get.
4417644	4420006	I see.
4421387	4430314	I mean, it's really too bad because it's a great skin, but I can do everything that I'm doing on Vista with an XP.
4431535	4437981	Are you looking forward to any of the gaming that's supposed to be coming out with the Vista, such as Halo 2 or any of that stuff?
4440543	4441223	Kind of.
4442364	4452713	Now that I have a little more powerful Windows machine, because my other two were pretty... They were really, really old.
4453473	4457236	So now that I have something... I got a 2.3...
4460484	4464467	All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4487100	4497807	Um, well, also, I'd like to kind of give my opinion on, uh, the, uh, how Konami basically releases the same game over and over again, but with new songs.
4497927	4499548	Alright, quickly, please, because we've got to keep moving.
4501489	4512316	Whenever I bought a new Beatmania game, at least, I don't know about DDR, but when I bought a new Beatmania game, I significantly improved.
4512637	4515078	I almost jumped another level up.
4515879	4516199	So...
4517006	4522231	I think that new songs are really all that I need to justify a whole new game.
4522251	4522311	Yep.
4522371	4522451	Bye.
4522511	4522711	Later.
4522731	4522911	Bye-bye.
4522931	4523071	Later.
4543382	4544802	So he has a huge EP in him?
4545043	4545823	Yeah, he has a huge EP.
4546083	4552965	He was kind of, he's kind of, it sounded like either he was high or he had the show on in the background and he was listening to it because I thought I heard myself recall it.
4552985	4554046	Maybe both.
4554146	4554626	Maybe both.
4555486	4556186	Just kidding.
4556426	4557387	We tease because we love.
4557427	4558307	Let's go to some other calls.
4560068	4562849	Let's go over here to this call.
4562949	4563909	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4563929	4564189	Who's this?
4568092	4569112	Hey, it's Seisha here.
4569372	4570633	Hi, Seisha, what's on your mind?
4570673	4572794	Turn down your speakers, because we can hear ourselves a little bit.
4572854	4573334	What's on your mind?
4576515	4577916	I'm hearing it echoing.
4579916	4580897	Oh, sorry, it's echoing.
4581077	4581617	That's alright.
4582177	4582837	What's on your mind?
4582897	4583798	We have a delay, too.
4584118	4587399	But that's because our voices are traveling all the way across the Atlantic.
4587419	4590720	Oh, I was just going to ask a question about Final Fantasy XII.
4591180	4592521	Yes, what do you want to know about Final Fantasy XII?
4595008	4602393	I want to know where this story leads to because I look on the internet everywhere and I can't find anything about it and I like spoilers.
4602973	4604414	You want spoilers on the story?
4608676	4609777	Yeah, I'm impatient.
4610717	4619743	I can't tell you that because that would ruin it for our listeners, but you could go to GameFAQs.com and there's a bunch of FAQs on how to get through the game or the strategy guide that's available.
4620203	4622224	I'm sure there's places out there where you can get it spoiled.
4622404	4623765	You're just not looking hard enough, buddy.
4625063	4627624	And besides, I haven't beaten it, so I couldn't tell you what happens.
4628644	4631464	There was like 50 games that came out in November that I haven't played.
4631484	4632205	You haven't beaten it yet?
4632225	4632885	No, I haven't.
4632905	4635145	I've gotten like... I got sucked back into WoW.
4637506	4637926	Oh, true.
4637986	4639086	I got back into WoW.
4639746	4640806	Like at level 70 already.
4642707	4643227	Alright, well.
4644007	4648828	So is there anything else you wanted to ask us about tonight besides the spoilers for Final Fantasy XII, which we're not sharing?
4650289	4652309	Why are you so crazy this evening?
4653044	4654005	I think we're... I don't know.
4654045	4655506	Why are we crazy this evening?
4655646	4656246	That's my fault.
4656827	4660169	That's partially Eddie and Rice Princess being here, but what else?
4660209	4661070	Maybe it's just something in the air.
4661090	4666753	I think that I'm a little bit unable to concentrate quite correctly today.
4667134	4669235	Banks, you sound really cute and hot.
4669836	4671577	Stop trying to get a date on the show.
4671777	4673258	Well, how am I supposed to date you?
4673358	4674579	You sound sexy.
4674619	4675039	Sorry.
4675660	4676840	Which means he's probably taken.
4678482	4679182	What was I going to say?
4679402	4679462	Um...
4681676	4682917	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4711505	4714107	Sasha, we gotta let you go, but thanks so much for your phone call.
4714967	4715608	And cheers.
4719010	4719490	Take care.
4719991	4720871	There's too much delay.
4720911	4721912	I couldn't keep it going.
4721952	4722292	I'm sorry, kids.
4722352	4723433	I wanted to say bi-sexy.
4723493	4724213	Thanks a lot.
4725014	4725434	We got it.
4725915	4726435	Say it now.
4726495	4727195	Sasha's listening.
4727235	4727676	Bi-sexy.
4727996	4728416	There you go.
4729517	4730397	You are so weird.
4730598	4731218	You're weird.
4731238	4732019	Your face is weird.
4732039	4733399	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4733419	4733860	Who's this?
4736822	4738163	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4738183	4738563	Who's this?
4740592	4741773	Oh, hi, this is Uni.
4742093	4743274	Hi, what's on your mind?
4743815	4745436	Hey, what's up, sexy pants?
4747618	4748759	What's on your mind, sweetie?
4752242	4754363	I know, I crack me up, too.
4757886	4764071	I was going to ask you guys if World of Warcraft was really worth it, because... Wait, we can hardly hear you.
4764652	4766133	What about World of Warcraft?
4766153	4767434	You want to ask what about World of Warcraft?
4772654	4774115	Is it really worth it?
4775115	4780298	She's actually being eaten by a Gru as she's talking to us, which is why she can't stop laughing.
4781099	4784221	It's so worth it.
4784261	4786882	You're the biggest addict probably out of all of us, right, Princess?
4786922	4787383	What do you think?
4788601	4788881	Yeah.
4789161	4791403	You hated all MMOs before World of Warcraft.
4791543	4791763	I did.
4791783	4792804	I absolutely hated them.
4792844	4794806	What sold you on World of Warcraft specifically?
4795026	4796067	Well, I don't know.
4796767	4799649	Wow, that was an awesome answer.
4799669	4802972	Okay, Matt gave me the two-week demo-y disc thing, whatever.
4802992	4804193	It's all Matt, our friend.
4804373	4804753	Love you, Matt.
4806079	4807860	and I was like, whatever, I'm bored.
4808220	4809101	I'm not working.
4809181	4809841	Uni hung up.
4810261	4811041	She was embarrassed.
4811962	4812642	Don't be embarrassed.
4812662	4813363	It was fun.
4813703	4815884	And I'm like, okay, I'll give it a try.
4815964	4822567	And I got to level 20 in like two days or something and you can't go past level 20 if you're on the demo thing.
4822587	4824168	And I'm like, oh man, that sucks.
4824208	4825288	This game's awesome.
4825368	4828290	And so I subscribed to it and then I signed my life away.
4828310	4829450	It was pretty awesome.
4830091	4835113	By the way, Paradox Vincent, who I accused of being high earlier, sent me a message and said, no, you're a tell-all.
4837337	4842842	DJ Tyrant wants to know, Rice Princess, what level are you?
4843483	4846285	I don't have any 60s and I've been playing for two years.
4846565	4847907	But you're a twink.
4848007	4848727	It's because you're a twink.
4848807	4849768	I have many twinks.
4850409	4852170	I have a lot of PVP twinks.
4852290	4854272	War Song Gold Show for life.
4856914	4858456	My highest level tune is a 38 Warlock.
4860738	4861338	on Trollbane.
4861618	4869542	Uni, I bet you any of the WoW players would be glad to hook you up with a free demo of WoW because they do that thing where you can download a demo on worldofwarcraft.com.
4869562	4870722	So you know what?
4870762	4872903	It's like the whole Xbox 360 strategy.
4873063	4874464	Demos, try before you buy.
4874504	4875924	And I think that's the best way to figure it out.
4876065	4877605	Ooh, girl, and I'll play with you.
4877925	4878646	There you go.
4878746	4879286	I'll show you around, girl.
4879306	4880146	It's the girls' club.
4880346	4881407	It's the girls' club on Warcraft.
4881447	4883148	Yeah, we get our hair did in the game.
4884968	4886269	Oh, here it is.
4886389	4888970	Uni says the classic, it's just that I want a blood elf.
4890166	4891127	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4899441	4901222	Not the gay twink.
4901242	4902703	Not the gay porn kind of twink.
4902743	4905485	And if you don't know what that is, you're fine.
4905605	4906325	Wait, a gay, yeah.
4906705	4909207	What is a twink in WoW, Bryce Princess?
4909287	4910007	Where does the name come from?
4910027	4918172	A twink in WoW is someone that has the best possible gear, the best enchants, the best everything that you can have at that level.
4918712	4921634	And it helps if they have blonde hair and they're usually Russian.
4921654	4922014	Russian.
4924758	4925718	You're terrible, Ron.
4926078	4931761	So I have a lot of twinks, and it's easy for me because I'm a girl, and I say, Hi, I'll be your internet girlfriend.
4931801	4932401	Give me gold.
4932781	4934642	And they're like, Okay, that's pretty cool.
4934982	4936502	I'm like, Sweet, I have a twink now.
4936622	4937203	Bye.
4938123	4939043	Nice knowing you.
4939443	4942044	No, I'm not really like that all the time.
4942565	4945286	But, yeah, that's what a twink is.
4946286	4948147	That was education.
4948167	4949527	I'm not going to explain what a gay twink is.
4949547	4950487	Look it up on Wikipedia.
4950507	4950668	No.
4950688	4950788	No.
4953103	4954683	Yeah, and isn't that so cool?
4955244	4959345	Or you could be a guy and just have a really high-pitched voice and be like, Hi!
4960225	4962426	Actually, they have a Valentine's Day event going on right now.
4962446	4962966	They do?
4963046	4967787	Yeah, I was trying to have my girl hit on other girls, but I didn't.
4968388	4969468	You were trying to be a lesbian?
4969588	4970328	Yeah, it's fun.
4970388	4971008	Lesbians are fun.
4971208	4973769	Yeah, you're supposed to hit on guys and they'll give you money.
4974509	4976770	Actually, no, I ended up hitting on guys because I screwed up.
4976830	4979451	I got the wrong thing, so I just decided to play it straight.
4979827	4982029	Beatmania and Virtual Console Games Who said you could call?
5000363	5002644	Um, I paid Loki five bucks.
5002785	5003885	Oh, it must be DMN.
5004005	5004546	Hi, DMN.
5004566	5005086	What's on your mind?
5005586	5006407	I'm doing pretty good.
5006707	5010729	You guys are talking about, uh... Wait, DMN, you've been a long-time listener of the show, right?
5011209	5011510	Yeah.
5011630	5013210	Is tonight a good show or a bad show?
5013271	5013751	Be honest.
5014251	5015712	God, this show's hilarious.
5015732	5016672	What are you talking about?
5017273	5017553	Awesome.
5017593	5017993	Winner!
5018293	5018834	Yay!
5019034	5019474	The winner's me.
5019574	5020154	Heart!
5020275	5020835	Level up!
5020915	5023436	Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do!
5024197	5025998	Wow, sorry, I just gained five stamina.
5026518	5029800	Um, what's... I'm sorry, you want Beatmania, Wii, what?
5029820	5029900	What?
5030942	5034543	Well, you guys were talking about the Beatmania location test in Illinois.
5035263	5043165	I'm almost wondering if that's a precursor to the oft-rumored, talked-about Beatmania sequel coming to the consoles.
5044965	5059889	You know, but we didn't see it at Gamers Day, which is a little bit of a, you know, it's not going to happen, but it is a little bit of a frowny face next to the idea, you know, because they did announce Beatmania 1 at Gamers Day last year, so, I mean, I would say it's still up in the air.
5060492	5061713	No, I'm not familiar with Gamers Day.
5061733	5064914	Did they announce Supernova CS?
5065054	5070996	Oh, well, we only ran about four stories on Gamers Day on the site, so I urge you to check out OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5071536	5072617	Yeah, look at the website, kids.
5073757	5075178	What did you want to know about Gamers Day?
5076038	5078539	Was Supernova CS announced last year?
5080260	5080900	I don't remember.
5082041	5083081	Actually, it may not have been.
5083261	5083981	You may have me there.
5084081	5085402	I don't think they did announce it.
5085802	5087783	I think they were showing Beatmania...
5088777	5092721	Last year, and it was the Karaoke Revolution Country.
5092781	5094102	They didn't show Supernova until E3.
5094663	5097565	They have that arcade machine there, and they announced Supernova for the console.
5097585	5098726	That's right, that's right.
5098746	5101909	They made the announcement of Supernova in the arcades at Gamers Day last year.
5102130	5103551	No, they said the consoles too, I think.
5103711	5107895	Oh yeah, and they said it was going to come to consoles, but they just didn't show the playable game.
5108175	5111398	That's right, because Loki and I were toot our own horn here.
5111438	5113580	Some of the first people in the country to play DDR Supernova.
5113640	5114161	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5115205	5117046	You didn't have to do the arm gestures, Ross.
5117107	5117987	Who wants to touch me?
5118087	5119148	You look like you're trying to fly away.
5119168	5120389	Oh, that was a steel-toed boot.
5121810	5123852	Anyway, so... I wouldn't wash that hand, by the way.
5125853	5125973	Ew.
5128555	5132258	Sephiroth1215 says the last consumer DDR shown at Gamers Day was extreme.
5133880	5135461	Okay, there you go.
5136301	5142666	Now, going back, I know Eddie was talking about how virtual console games are priced, you know, so expensively.
5142867	5143327	He sure was.
5144013	5147876	I could have put that on the N64 games.
5147956	5152278	I think $10 is stupid, especially since that system blew.
5152298	5154380	Pokemon Snap, motherfucker!
5154400	5155681	I'd pay $10 for that.
5155881	5160304	About a year ago, they were announcing they were considering maybe having all the NES games be free.
5160524	5162925	And I mean, I don't see why that would have been out of the question.
5162945	5165647	I mean, like you said, the games were like 20 years old.
5165687	5168049	They made their money off of them, and now it's like they're selling bits.
5168229	5170791	And I could go buy Animal Crossing and get half those games for free.
5172392	5172792	Yeah.
5172812	5172892	Yeah.
5173993	5179077	But I honestly think that $8 for SNES games is a pretty fair price.
5179217	5181979	I mean, I'd gladly pay $8 for Linkin Park.
5182019	5182679	Eddie disagrees.
5183159	5183740	Why do you disagree?
5183760	5184280	I disagree, too.
5184520	5184721	Why?
5184821	5185741	Because you guys are poor.
5187422	5188123	In part, yes.
5188363	5189724	No, I mean, it's just the whole thing.
5189744	5196589	I understand they have to pay for setting up for the retro console, but they don't have to pay for actually making cartridges, sending them out, shipping them out.
5196709	5199331	What if, like, they charge, like, one fee...
5199935	5200696	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5222341	5223402	Retro Reasons or whatever.
5223442	5225523	It's not like we really want to obtain the game.
5226084	5228986	And also, Nintendo's trying to target that new generation.
5229506	5232728	Half of the people who may be playing the Wii have never even played these games before.
5233308	5233569	True.
5235010	5235190	True.
5235230	5235410	True dat.
5235430	5237992	Doesn't mean they have to charge so much fucking money for it.
5238012	5246437	Actually, though, I notice a lot of people that are getting into the Wii kind of like remember the old NES, like the old Mario Brothers and that stuff.
5246477	5248799	So I think, you know, there's a certain nostalgia value to it, too.
5249924	5250925	DM, anything else for our listeners?
5250965	5251005	Um...
5277590	5280131	SSJ100, Matt's going to be on STFU this week.
5280151	5280751	That's about it.
5280991	5281692	That should be fun.
5282152	5284152	STFU, Thursday nights, right here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5284352	5286393	Hey, I heard Jimmy was on Cross Platform this week.
5287614	5287974	I heard.
5288034	5289834	He didn't tell me until a couple days ago.
5290194	5295716	How is it that you guys have accomplished more in 11, 12 weeks of your program than we've accomplished in five years?
5298817	5300138	We model your work ethic.
5300718	5302038	Dear DMN, I hate you.
5302198	5302599	Love, Rob.
5303279	5304279	No, no, you don't.
5304559	5305139	You're right, I don't.
5305580	5306400	Hugs and kisses, DMN.
5306420	5306900	Don't be a dick.
5309016	5309437	Take care.
5310437	5310718	All right.
5311718	5317382	So, you know, I'm going to make a show that counters STFU and it's going to be called DIAF.
5318543	5319123	Diet of Fire?
5319263	5319544	Yeah.
5319564	5320184	That'll be good.
5320344	5322666	And it's just going to be setting people on fire.
5322726	5323326	Good times.
5324187	5324907	Last minute stories.
5324927	5326268	Let's go around and get the last minute stories.
5326308	5327429	Anybody have anything they want to share?
5327669	5327929	I do.
5328210	5329070	Okay, yeah, StarkSakura.
5329090	5329951	Rondo of Blood!
5332915	5336758	DarkSakura will not be seen on next week's program, or any program afterwards, actually.
5336918	5339140	Because she'll be playing Rondo of Blood.
5339420	5341201	Actually, I did have something, though, off-topic.
5341562	5345605	I'm actually not going to be able to be live Tuesday, but the Tuesday after I will be.
5346085	5346405	Sweet.
5346545	5347726	I have my midterms.
5347786	5349408	More Pump Up the Volume, goodness.
5349668	5351449	Pump Up the Volume will be back the week after next.
5352030	5352310	Awesome.
5353511	5354592	Loki, you have anything last minute?
5355372	5356153	Wow, nothing.
5356333	5356833	That's a first.
5357254	5357614	Amazing.
5358455	5360156	Well, I don't have anything either, so I guess that's it.
5360656	5362238	That's another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
5362258	5362798	Down the crapper.
5364212	5367954	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.
5367994	5368554	You guys rock.
5369095	5370796	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5371016	5372537	We'll start off with our special guest tonight.
5372577	5373577	Thank you guys so much for being here.
5373618	5374718	Rice Princess, your final thought.
5379101	5380402	That was a queef, not a fart.
5380782	5381843	Okay, thank you for clarifying.
5381863	5383284	Wow.
5384224	5386626	Casper the Gay, also known as Eddie, your final thought.
5386666	5389488	Yeah, yeah, don't join Rob's FaceSite thing.
5389528	5391469	Join my MySpace at W-I-I-D-D-Y.
5392785	5393085	What?
5394566	5394847	Nothing.
5396047	5397248	Oh, Weed, I get it.
5397488	5400430	Weed D. I get it, because like Eddie, but Weed.
5400450	5402212	Also, I'm really gay.
