13628	20255	Tonight, February 18th, 2007, new arcade games are revealed, including Tekken 6 and Silent Hill.
20455	27002	Someone in the know violates Microsoft's partner, NetNDA, and could rare be developing something for a Nintendo platform?
31707	36190	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36230	44456	We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about and a little bit of gaming culture, geek culture, pop culture types affair.
45036	47298	I'm here to help you through the next few hours of Orange Lounge Radio.
47338	52181	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.
52221	54903	Whoa, the angsty, loud Dark Sakura.
54943	55343	How are you?
57224	57945	I hate people.
58505	59025	I'm sorry to hear it.
59045	59806	Why do you hate people?
60558	61519	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
88900	91742	and what I noticed is that I was very loud, so I apologize for that.
91782	93164	So I've adjusted the audio for this week.
93184	93924	That's okay, we're used to it.
94805	98208	But on the playback, because it's a lowered bitrate on the podcast, it didn't sound as bad.
98228	99208	It didn't sound as tin canny.
99228	99609	As usual.
99789	100970	So I don't think it'll be so bad.
101290	103812	The show sucked, but I was good.
103832	104913	Really?
105073	106895	I'm just kidding.
108296	108776	I'm just kidding.
108856	109597	That's surprising.
110017	110257	No, I...
112435	118397	What the... Doing it the whole time and you're like... Have you been like snorting crack today?
118417	119937	No, I had a frappuccino.
120077	120458	Oh, goody.
121918	122278	Here we go.
122338	123598	It's another one of those shows.
124399	125359	A crackuccino.
125659	126859	Say hello as well to Loki.
127260	130100	I forgot that I turned the mic off so I didn't catch that last comment.
130120	133742	That's why I didn't call you Tech Mask to Loki tonight because apparently you forgot how to work sound equipment.
133902	134322	Good job.
134482	135122	The winner is you.
135742	135962	Hey.
136042	136883	We hope you have enjoyed.
137603	138743	I know how to use sound equipment.
139923	140304	Do you?
140944	141264	Yes.
141284	141604	All right.
142219	144640	Well, we have some special guests with us in studio tonight.
144720	146020	They're extra special.
146060	146780	They have their own bus.
146800	149221	It's going to be another very interesting week here at Orange Launch Radio.
149641	154282	The feedback from last week is that you guys liked a little bit of the silliness we had going on last week.
154362	158003	So we brought some of the silliest people we know to the program.
158523	162484	Say hello to one of the Orange Launch Radio... Oh, God damn it.
162605	166225	Oh, I get the mailbag.
166245	167686	No, no mailbag for you.
167826	168026	Sorry.
169312	169832	and DarkSakura.com.
199655	201617	and also say hello to somebody brand new.
201697	205019	She's losing her Orange Lounge cherry tonight.
205059	206420	She's brand new to the program.
212945	214346	It's Marissa.
214506	215627	Hello.
216528	217228	How are you, Marissa?
217248	218749	I love it when you talk nerdy to me.
219010	219390	All right.
220546	223447	Marissa is the originator of Utus Braziers.
224068	230310	I would like to point out, whatever brazier Marissa has on tonight, you know, I might be gay, but I can't help but look.
230470	235512	Marissa, you have to do it for the listeners so that they hear the original Utus Braziers.
236153	237333	Should I do it right now or later?
237393	238053	Sure, why not?
238274	238534	Why not?
238994	241215	Well, the Utus Braziers thing originated because...
242570	247193	I am a A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, A, B, H, H, H, H, no.
247213	256518	For all you nerds out there, I am wearing a... I'm a geek too, I'm just a music geek.
258199	262661	I am a double G. So my sisters were complaining about the types of bras that they get to wear.
263456	268400	And I thought this was the most ridiculous thing ever, because it is awkward changing in the, uh, in the locker room.
268760	276005	But they have all these choices, you know, Spangly this, and Clear Strats this, and that, and, you know, Zebra Bras, and all they get to wear are UTA'S BRAZERS!
276726	279228	You know, Nazi bras from the Third Reich!
280209	282230	You will wear them, and you will like them!
283211	285432	In old country, teeth did not fly free.
285833	286773	They were disciplined!
287334	289596	And they stood at attention like rockets!
293608	293948	Wow.
294108	295068	That's where I came from.
297950	300071	Of course, we have our chat room.
300111	302592	We would never have a show complete without our chat room.
302732	304393	Is the chat room going insane?
304513	309256	The minute Marissa said double G's.
309456	313818	Alpha Catagram says double G. Shadows Liar says this is the best show ever.
314755	322889	Fireboma says keep this girl alright but now because the show is about video games we need to kind of confess Marissa you're not a hardcore gamer are you?
323562	327624	No, because I've been depressed ever since they stopped making King's Quest.
328524	331546	Okay, but so you did, you used to play like the old school adventure games, right?
331566	332647	Oh, I was obsessed with it, yeah.
332667	334848	I was obsessed with the, yeah, all of them.
335088	338269	Have you heard about the King's Quest fan project, the Silver Lining?
338649	340270	We host the demo on Orangelandradio.com.
340350	348654	I hadn't heard of the brand new one, although I downloaded, I guess, Tierra as opposed to Sierra made remakes of the really, really old school ones.
349015	349515	I downloaded those.
349535	350635	I think I remember, yeah, hearing about that.
350655	350735	Cool.
350755	350995	Yeah.
352640	353700	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
373510	374491	It did get a little boring.
374871	381854	Sometimes it's tough to live up to the classics, you know, when people say, oh, there's this new game out and it's like the classics, but then you play it and it's really not, you know.
382155	385216	It's true, but I think a lot of the appeal of the adventure games was the humor.
385696	386997	In Siberia, I kind of lacked that.
387797	388658	I've been eaten by a grue.
388898	392140	I gotta say, Jared J. in chat says, she loves King's Quest?
392200	393200	Oh my god, marry me.
394181	395541	Marissa's taken, yes.
396102	401004	Oh yes, but for a little self-whoring, myspace.com slash Marissa Mizell, M-A-R-I-S-S-A
402964	403364	I'm a musician.
416044	416584	Fuck you!
416624	417324	And that whole thing?
441072	441953	That's cool, that's cool.
442493	448197	Alright, I was going to say, as a legitimate musician, what do you think about Guitar Hero?
448818	450339	Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
450659	452861	Is this a good ho, ho, ho, or a bad ho, ho, ho?
453701	454082	Okay, what?
454762	457224	Really quickly, so we can get to the crux of the show here.
457244	458305	What do you think of Guitar Hero?
458345	459066	Good thing, bad thing?
459106	460166	I've already sworn on this show.
460186	460987	Am I allowed to again?
462408	463209	It's on the internet.
463389	466651	Fuck, shit, cock, cunt, piss, whore, whatever you want.
466671	468332	I fucking hate Guitar Hero!
468372	468453	No!
469335	470655	Why do you hate Guitar Hero?
470775	475816	Well, I guess it's fun, but learning to play guitar gets you laid.
477696	480437	Playing video game guitar does not.
483117	493959	Well, no, it's only good fun, and I like that it brings attention to classic music, but the most interesting part is that musicians suck at Guitar Hero, just like real dancers suck at DDR.
493999	494379	It's true.
494419	498480	They have videos of guys on the Internet playing their own songs on Guitar Heroes, and they fucking suck at them.
499173	499854	It's sad.
500755	502136	It's really, really funny.
502316	511626	Megzi, when she has a Guitar Hero demo set up at her GameStop, and they sit there and they ask her, so does this teach you how to play a real guitar?
512147	513368	She goes, no, it doesn't.
513709	515010	No, but that's what it advertises.
515270	515991	No, it doesn't.
516692	520556	And she has to get through to people to tell them it does not teach you how to play guitar.
520876	523658	I would like to say Jared Jay has changed his mind on Marissa.
524259	525340	Oh shit, now I hate you.
525700	528002	And I quote, I quote, go fuck a goat.
530944	531345	That's all right.
531505	533447	But classic rock is good.
534207	537770	You'll learn to embrace when the listeners tell you to go fuck things.
539472	540632	I like go fuck a cactus.
540653	541553	That's my favorite.
542254	543295	Does that give me any points?
543595	544316	All right.
544416	546357	Rice Princess is going to make a cameo real quick.
546778	547238	Hi, I agree.
548244	549145	Oh, Marissa Rice Princess.
549165	550226	Sorry, I'm introducing myself.
550266	551047	Hi, Chris.
551087	552088	Nice to meet you.
552208	553429	Okay, what's up, Rice Princess?
553449	553850	How you doing?
554350	554991	Okay, I'm sick.
555211	556352	You brought a posse with you.
556372	556632	What is this?
556672	557433	I brought my posse.
557453	558514	Introduce your posse real quick.
558534	559114	Okay, this is Chance.
559755	560356	Hey, what's up?
560716	562678	Real quickly, because we're not going to have time to have air bands show.
562718	563739	Chance, what type of games do you like?
564940	567022	PS2 games, like RPG games.
567662	568163	RPG games?
568243	568763	Action games.
569204	569884	Wow.
570285	571246	Wow, and World of Warcraft?
571266	572467	Wow, yeah.
572487	573788	How about, wait, board games, like Cold Step?
574502	576644	I don't play video games, do I?
596139	597299	He doesn't play video games.
597339	597819	He plays WoW.
597839	598940	We're not picking him up on the mic either.
599040	600140	But he says he doesn't play video games.
600380	603340	I'm Chris, and I am a butt.
603360	604441	All right, video games suck.
604481	605301	And this is Heather.
605781	606341	Hi, Heather.
606381	607561	Come up real quick.
608541	609082	How are you, Heather?
609262	609902	Great, how are you?
610242	610442	Good.
610462	611102	Do you play video games?
611762	612062	Kind of.
612222	613442	I'm a button masher, sorry to say.
613822	614303	Button masher?
614323	615083	What type of games do you play?
615363	616263	Get the mic a little closer to your mouth.
616483	619003	Halo, Soul Collaborator, Burnout.
619664	620704	Are you any good at Gears of War?
621204	621624	Never played it.
622393	627597	We're looking for some good players for Gears of War for something I can't talk about yet.
627698	631901	But we need to put together a team for Gears of War, and I'm very scared.
631921	634123	Interesting.
634443	635564	Pick that one up and check it out.
636224	636505	Okay.
636925	637726	And let me know how it goes.
638827	639267	All right.
639307	640548	So what is this now, Rice Princess?
640888	643871	Is this like one of those swelled ego things after the last show?
644191	647293	You got like a fan letter, and now you have this swelled ego.
647313	647694	Hey, you know what?
647814	648094	I got two.
648114	650216	She has to have an entourage everywhere she goes.
650276	651737	I got two fan letters now.
652318	653959	Yeah, I'm taking over your show now.
653999	654539	Sorry, Rob.
654899	656239	Did you know that I'm moving in?
657000	657400	Again?
658260	660201	This will be the last week of Orange Lounge Radio.
660981	663122	Hope you enjoyed the program while it lasted.
663142	663982	Shut up.
664382	664662	All right.
665322	666323	All right, anyway.
666363	667603	Irene was here from show one.
668263	669684	Irene, you were here for show one, weren't you?
669704	670024	I totally was.
670044	671244	That was three studios ago.
671404	672165	Yeah, seriously.
672225	672625	I remember.
673025	676086	All right, well, just like old times, you should go clean my kitchen.
676306	678987	Just like old times, I should punch you in your gob.
679007	679227	All right.
680219	682060	Dan repaired our whodunit, so I actually played some pinball.
682120	684121	I brought my PS2 over here and we never played it.
703482	709225	I heard you brought it over here for Silent Hill, but the Miglatov was like, no, my panties are bunched too tight, I can't play Silent Hill tonight.
709245	710986	Well, I also brought Crazy Taxi and we didn't play it.
711006	711986	Crazy money.
712747	713467	For PS2?
713827	714227	Yeah.
714247	716168	You can only play that on Dreamcast, I'm sorry.
716268	718449	Well, I just grabbed a handful of stuff.
718509	718790	Alright.
720931	721411	Interesting.
722331	722651	That's it?
722932	723152	Really?
723332	723692	Nothing else?
723752	724052	Yeah.
724312	725353	It's kind of slow.
725373	726733	That's alright, that's alright.
726753	727354	You're a busy girl.
727514	728374	Can't play games all the time.
729095	730415	Loki, how was your gaming week?
730935	731676	My gaming week was fun.
732307	736290	I played all... Basically, I just played only Crackdown.
737211	738112	The full Crackdown.
738132	739934	Yeah, you got the retail release, right?
740174	740354	Yeah.
740554	742316	Yeah, so you're one of those bastards that got it early.
742336	743537	Because street dates don't apply to me.
744017	746459	Okay, well, sorry.
747140	752204	So, yeah, I'm about two-thirds way through the game already, and it's worth it.
752945	757969	I really cannot wait until everyone else gets it so I can play some co-op.
758550	765516	But it's actually pretty funny, because if you watch some of the AI, like, especially the AI drivers, they're horrible.
766136	772761	In fact, I was trying to kill this one guy, and I heard all this crashing going on below me, and there was a freeway below me.
772841	781949	So I, you know, got on the edge and looked down, and there was this giant pileup of cars, and you can actually see cars being ejected out of the tunnel and just getting thrown into the ocean.
782069	783930	And it was hilarious, and I had nothing to do with it.
783950	785852	It was just the crabby AI drivers...
786926	789788	Just crash into each other and just launch cars into the air.
790989	794331	Some crackdown comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
794792	795092	Let's see.
795813	800676	OLArmyBlaze says, Okay, well, whoop-de-fucking-do, Mr. I work in distribution.
802217	803638	But JeremyTel1 has a serious question.
803718	806160	Loki, is the game too easy like I think it will be?
806500	809503	Like, are all the bosses really easy to kill once you start leveling up?
809963	815287	It gets harder as you go on because the first, the Los Maritos bosses are, you know, pretty easy.
815762	816522	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
842115	844577	If you want more of a challenge, play on a harder difficulty.
844937	853643	But I think you'll be at least... Play through the whole game, and then if you want to go back and play it harder, definitely play the more challenging difficulties.
853703	858866	I think, as it is, it gets kind of hard, especially when you get towards the last gang, the Asian gang.
859366	863209	It's just, they're crazy, the amount of people that they throw at you.
865130	866290	I don't know, it does get harder, though.
868732	869913	Anything else in your gaming week besides Crackdown?
869933	870253	Crackdown?
871049	893256	Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories still still after all this time oh yeah we'll be playing until the next game comes out alright one other question here Jay Dorian asks Loki how does the full games world compare to the demo how much bigger does it feel well the demo it was just pretty much half of the first island it's not even the whole first island and the game feels huge I mean like
895432	897252	I can't recognize certain areas of the game.
897292	899133	I mean, you can get lost pretty easy in it.
899333	900894	So it does feel very large.
900994	903415	There's a ton of places to explore.
903576	907598	I've been practically everywhere in the first two islands or whatever.
908298	919744	And I've only found about less than a third of the secret orbs and just over half of the agility orbs.
919804	921905	And I've already maxed out my...
923764	927585	Strength, and I'm about to max out my explosives.
928505	933387	So, I mean, there's just a ton of stuff to explore.
933587	934427	I did like the achievement.
934447	937107	There's one achievement for killing people with this globe.
937488	939968	It's a giant globe that you find at the observatory.
940828	941008	No.
941348	947250	It's like a giant metal globe, and you have to kill 15 people with it, and that was fun.
947290	948630	You bowl them over or something?
948650	949510	Something like that.
949530	951211	You basically kind of toss it onto them.
951251	951851	Throw it at their head.
952264	956403	Yeah, throw it at their head Interesting I kill people all the time by throwing things at their head
957526	965428	The fun part's going to be coming to, I think, the co-op gameplay, because you can just run around and do whatever the fuck you want in that game.
966148	974530	That's going to be fun, and what's kind of neat about it, and you don't really notice this in the demo, the full game, you can actually have people jump in and out of your game while you're playing.
975210	975911	I heard about that.
975931	979491	That sounds pretty intuitive, but is that as good as it sounds, you think?
979591	983092	Yeah, it's just going to be people jumping in and out, and you don't necessarily have to play with them.
983112	985693	They can go fuck around your city or whatever.
986693	987794	So that's going to be kind of cool.
989235	999380	I remember hearing a long time ago one of the first downloads that they were going to have for Crackdown was a replay editor or something like that where you can record your own gameplay.
999420	1001321	So that might be pretty fun to share that with people.
1004203	1004583	Anything else?
1005043	1005463	That's it.
1006404	1007785	Real quickly, I haven't done a lot this week.
1008525	1012527	I finally have taken a WoW character, World of Warcraft, further than I ever have before.
1013108	1013708	My character...
1014472	1019717	I don't have Burning Crusade yet because I don't see the point of getting it if I'm not gonna...
1040305	1044328	Blood Elves are awesome, but seriously, on my server, everyone is playing Blood Elves.
1044729	1045129	Everyone.
1047391	1052315	And then I also play Paperboy, which is awesome, on the Xbox 360, the old game.
1052735	1055697	It translates pretty well to the Xbox 360, I gotta say.
1055958	1059420	Because the game itself was kind of widescreen, like a little bit.
1059480	1061782	Like if you remember the old cabinet it was in, it was kind of widescreen.
1062082	1065185	So they didn't have to smoosh it or anything, and the vertical bars aren't quite as big.
1065546	1067166	The achievements are kind of smart.
1067226	1071267	They're not like really super duper easy, but not super duper hard either like the previous games.
1071667	1074428	But I think Paperboy itself was a much harder game than I remember.
1074748	1077649	Paperboy is one of those like few truly original games.
1078169	1080890	So definitely I recommend you guys check out the demo if you're 360 owners.
1081130	1084990	Because if you never played Paperboy, at least, you know, play the first level that the demo gives you.
1085371	1091672	I think you'll find it's creative enough and original enough of a game to necessitate buying the full game.
1092281	1101563	And they have co-op modes, and I think there's a competitive mode, I can't remember, because I haven't taken it online yet, because most of my week's been on Warcraft, unfortunately.
1102523	1107865	I tried to get more achievements in Fusion Frenzy 2, but honestly, I couldn't tolerate the game long enough to do it.
1107985	1111606	Like, I got so fed up, I was like, oh my god, this game sucks, I turned it off.
1111626	1113146	I was like, it's not worth it.
1113606	1117367	I don't care what achievement point challenges are going on right now, I will earn them somewhere else.
1117807	1118387	I can't do it.
1118887	1120208	Fusion Frenzy 2 is just that bad.
1121008	1121968	Sigh.
1122386	1123346	Chris, how was your gaming week?
1124287	1127068	I have become a World of Warcraft nerd.
1127648	1128528	Congratulations!
1128588	1129909	Yeah, clap for me.
1130109	1130449	I need it.
1130549	1140672	Anyway, yeah, I just, I'm on only two of the servers, which is, one is the noob one, which is where everyone starts out, Hydraxis, I think.
1140952	1141953	I don't know, I can't pronounce names.
1142413	1145874	And I've got like ten characters on there that haven't even reached level fifteen.
1146914	1147994	That's right, you gotta start somewhere.
1148054	1152736	Yeah, and then I've got, but I have Burning Crusades, because if I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get all of it.
1153436	1166700	And it's really funny, on both the elves, because, you know, when you start off a new character, they all start with that little cinema, and they all say it with the elves, it's like, it's like the elves, like, the last of their races, everybody is a fucking elf.
1167641	1172282	Everyone is a blood elf, everyone is a night elf, they're all, like, they're all over the frickin' place.
1172302	1174723	It's like, oh, last of my, last of the race, my ass.
1175506	1178687	But the Draenei, oh my god, I don't care what anyone says, those things are hot.
1179387	1179987	I love the Draenei.
1180007	1181168	The Draenei girls are pretty hot.
1181348	1184229	Ugh, their Russian accents make me horny.
1186509	1189090	Please don't hold back.
1189590	1191251	I love those things so much.
1191331	1194452	I think they were supposed to be something else, but I like them being aliens.
1194512	1194932	It's amusing.
1194972	1200234	Every time I hear the Draenei females speak, though, I can't help but think, Boris, look, it's Musa and Drew.
1200254	1201054	Yes, it was Musa and Drew.
1202484	1203406	Not Another Age.
1203566	1205310	You know, I just love those things.
1205770	1208095	So, if anyone wants to find me, I mean...
1210095	1211076	Go to Jamie's MySpace.
1211136	1211877	I'm on MySpace.
1212077	1213758	You're in my top eight.
1213938	1214599	I'm in her top eight.
1214639	1216500	You're in the Orange Lounge top, actually.
1216801	1217121	I am?
1217381	1217641	You are.
1218582	1219563	I feel so special.
1219583	1219883	You are.
1220323	1221104	Send me a note.
1221204	1222005	I'll tell you who I am.
1222065	1223186	Seriously, I suck.
1223266	1224747	I don't know how to type in general yet.
1224907	1228390	So if somebody knows, please inform me.
1228870	1229611	I seriously don't.
1229651	1230552	I know how to type.
1230572	1231793	You type slash one.
1232013	1232313	Really?
1232333	1234335	Slash one, space, and then whatever you want to say.
1234395	1235676	Oh, goddammit.
1235736	1239539	It's like interesting things pop up, and it's really funny when the horde shows up.
1240330	1241031	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1269574	1270915	Yeah, so I'm on the Horde side, definitely.
1270955	1271495	Yeah, of course.
1271515	1276358	I've got both, but... Now that they have Blood Elves, you're starting to see a lot of the noobness on the Horde side.
1276378	1279880	The Blood Elf males are the only ones that I can stand because they're not all butch.
1279920	1280861	Well, they're very gay.
1281161	1281921	I know, I love them.
1282602	1284863	They're so... It's like, can I help you?
1285946	1289747	I'm looking and Uni is jumping up and down going, ooh, it's slash one, type slash one.
1290727	1291587	Thank you.
1291707	1292708	Uni's being very helpful.
1292848	1293288	Thank you.
1293328	1294788	She's noob friendly.
1296168	1304330	Some people come up to me, you know what, that game is the most, WoW is the most frustrating fucking game in the world because there are people walking around you and I'm not used to that.
1304530	1305451	I'm not used to MMOs.
1306111	1306751	I've never played them.
1307131	1309272	And so somebody comes up to me, do you want to duel?
1309792	1310952	No, thank you, decline.
1311624	1312204	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1341957	1343358	Don't give me that look!
1343378	1345539	God, she gives me that look every time I offer to pay for something!
1345579	1345879	Shut up!
1372003	1373144	We'll talk about it after the show.
1373884	1374644	Oh, I got that look.
1374984	1377566	All you need to do is some sweet lovin'.
1379487	1381728	So I'm going to go on break right now.
1381748	1383369	Yeah, we'll be right back, guys.
1383489	1386510	Wow, wow.
1386810	1389311	This is the hottest episode of Orange Lounge ever.
1389952	1394254	I can't believe we're offering to eat pussy over World of Warcraft.
1395774	1398335	Girls are going to eat each other out over World of Warcraft.
1398555	1402357	Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.
1402437	1404378	Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.
1404478	1406679	Hey, to quote Randall, I love the cock.
1409780	1411000	I just had to defend myself here.
1411441	1411701	All right.
1412141	1414022	Oh, sorry.
1414082	1414402	All right.
1414682	1415642	Cock love and Marissa.
1415722	1418464	Wait, wait, wait.
1418504	1419504	How many of us have shoes off?
1421005	1421845	I have my shoes off.
1422285	1423986	My half-Japanese boyfriend would kick my ass.
1424771	1426753	Marissa takes off her shoes, then it's a Mississippi orgy?
1426893	1427854	Mississippi orgy!
1427914	1428535	Woo!
1429135	1431237	Explain the Mississippi orgy thing again for anybody who's new.
1431257	1443188	State law in Mississippi is that if three or more people, and at least one of them is, I think, nope, it's three or more people with one person of an opposite gender in the room, it's an orgy.
1444389	1445250	With your socks and shoes off.
1446108	1447208	or with your shoes off, I'm sorry.
1447329	1447749	There you go.
1448329	1451810	We are having a Mississippi orgy on Orange Sound Radio.
1451890	1453571	Jeremy Todd 1 says, I disagree, Rob.
1453591	1455732	The episode with the Mississippi orgy was the hottest episode ever.
1455772	1456252	Well, here you go.
1456272	1457952	That's why I told Marissa to take off her shoes.
1458032	1459473	Return of the Mississippi orgy.
1461428	1463709	Now we need some shine and we're set!
1484289	1486911	So yeah, that's the first gaming system where I actually went, ooh, I want it.
1487831	1499578	You know, this is a very profound thing we're talking about here because, you know, you read – from our perspective as hardcore gamers, you're always reading on the game blogs about Nintendo's trying to get the casual gamers back into gaming.
1499878	1502079	How can we get the casual gamers back into gaming?
1502119	1506882	So I ask you, what – I mean, you're saying the DS is the first system you have ever bought with your own money.
1507362	1507562	What –
1508340	1509100	What made you do it?
1509560	1512981	Well, I've always been broke, so that has something to do with the fact that I didn't have one before.
1513381	1521163	But quite frankly, a lot of, I mean, no, PC gaming isn't the equivalent to an entire, you know, to a game system.
1521623	1522623	She wants Link's ass.
1522803	1523003	What?
1523503	1524323	She wants Link's ass.
1526284	1528784	TheRobD says, every chick I know is excited about the Wii.
1528824	1529645	I know every chick.
1529845	1531325	Oh, the gaming system, never mind.
1533140	1533461	Get it?
1533801	1536143	Uh-huh, uh-huh, give me that.
1539405	1547931	But the DS just offered something completely new as far as the touchscreen interface, and you could play a game away in advance, which was cool, you know, double deal.
1550723	1551723	And it's accessible.
1551943	1557065	I mean, it really is for people like me who are kind of dyslexic and all the buttons and the functions, etc.
1557705	1559166	You know, and that's what they say sometimes.
1559266	1563187	Is it the fact that you look at an Xbox 360 controller and you're like, too many buttons.
1563587	1564647	What the fuck is that?
1564747	1566248	That's a spaceship.
1567568	1569929	Well, the original controller was a fucking spaceship.
1570249	1572130	For the original Xbox, it is.
1572710	1579052	But yeah, I mean, I think it could potentially get people into gaming again because it seems like...
1579810	1593233	There isn't a single, I mean, I'm sure that there can be some recommendations, but there aren't a lot of mainstream ways to just completely reintroduce somebody into gaming who's used to the, you know, classic Nintendo, ah, God bless it, you know, two-button interface.
1593333	1602495	So, I think that the Wii is a great, you know, I think they ultimately could become more successful with more complicated gaming, etc.
1602815	1604095	But, Cooking Mama is fun.
1605361	1606402	Oh, God, not another one.
1606422	1607062	Cooking Mama.
1607262	1608944	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
1608964	1610885	I'm burnt out on it, though, I will admit.
1611045	1612106	I want off this show.
1613007	1618791	A very special listener sent me pictures of Mama cosplay, which you'll hear about later.
1619352	1620753	Can I tell the Mama cosplayer?
1621531	1623412	Go outside, please.
1623712	1624292	It's on my phone.
1624332	1626033	I'll show you the Mama Con.
1626053	1627334	You also need to go outside.
1627674	1628054	You know what?
1628094	1630975	You need to bite my ass, but to quote Chris in a non-little sense.
1631215	1640119	I do have to complain, though, and this is really old-school gaming, but my friend told me to try to get into RPGs to try Morrowind, and I bought a video game to play, not to read.
1641900	1643901	Not to walk every fucking where.
1643941	1644721	I just had to say that.
1645041	1646902	However, here's a really awesome picture of me in a hat.
1647959	1651802	Have you ever... Actually, speaking more, have you ever played Elder Scrolls Oblivion?
1652122	1652342	Ever?
1652542	1654063	Like, it's kind of an adventure game.
1654123	1654984	It's pretty as hell.
1655004	1656105	I'll have to show it to you someday.
1656125	1656625	No, I haven't.
1656645	1657065	It's very pretty.
1657406	1658446	It's very... It's fun.
1659547	1661828	Well, I don't have an Xbox, but Chris has an Xbox, yes.
1661909	1662129	It's for 360.
1662189	1664410	He plays black all the time.
1666311	1666852	Wow.
1666932	1667752	Who's doing that cosplay?
1667772	1668093	Do we know?
1668593	1669053	That's funny.
1669093	1669814	It's some convention.
1669914	1670434	That's great.
1671195	1671895	All right.
1672155	1675838	Oh, is that something Rama sent you from the... Oh, my bad.
1676451	1677531	Am I not supposed to spoil?
1679192	1679692	For the record.
1679872	1682253	I love that look, Jamie.
1683233	1683974	Stop pouting.
1685454	1686274	Bad Rob.
1686334	1686855	So cute.
1686955	1687915	Bad Rob.
1688255	1691856	All right, then let's keep the show moving so we can get to some news and whatever it is Jamie's keeping secret.
1691916	1694017	I'll show you movement, bowel movement.
1694117	1698338	All right, anyhow, let's get to some gaming news, thankfully.
1698438	1700699	Oh, God, yes, we need some gaming news here on this program.
1701479	1702580	So who's going to start us off tonight?
1702660	1703020	Oh, I think.
1703795	1705296	I know, we actually talk about games once in a while.
1705516	1706337	In fact, get this.
1706597	1707117	You know what, Chris?
1707197	1708838	We actually get some exclusives.
1709779	1711460	Things you haven't heard anywhere else yet.
1711580	1712301	Oh my god, really?
1712481	1713021	Exactly.
1713121	1714302	That's amazing.
1714522	1715643	Loki's going to tell us.
1716304	1716684	Never mind.
1718625	1720486	Why don't you all go back to whatever you were doing before?
1721267	1721507	Alright.
1723208	1724069	Anyways, so...
1725386	1731649	Like last week how we had some exclusive dates for the Microsoft games, today we come with a brand new company, Midway.
1731769	1733350	We have a whole lineup for their games.
1734151	1738873	And the core subject of the change, you know, like a certain Halo 3 date, you know.
1739505	1752231	Which I still believe that that game Oh yes, I forgot to mention, the Halo 3 official teaser came out this week And there it is right there, Fall 2007 And Loki had said on this show previously, what, April or May or something?
1752472	1753872	May, but Wrong!
1754112	1761396	Well, here's why, okay, and I have a couple reasons why I think they're doing this One, it's a big Christmas, you know, they don't have a big Christmas game coming out
1762021	1767966	2.
1762141	1767966	I think they thought that the PlayStation 3 was going to be in a better position to, you know, where there might actually be a threat.
1767986	1773771	You know, right now I don't see PlayStation 3s flying off the shelves, and they certainly don't have the lineup for it, so...
1774414	1776616	You don't need to put the game out right now.
1776956	1782842	And to be honest, I think the game will probably be done by May, but they'll just hold it until Christmas so they can capitalize on that stuff.
1783102	1785224	So lesson learned about the distribution dates.
1785244	1786245	I mean, we've said it before.
1786305	1788507	This isn't anything we didn't tell you when we said the Halo 3 the first time.
1788827	1789868	Dates are subject to change.
1789968	1791750	Retailers push things back all the time.
1791770	1792951	You read about this on blogs.
1792991	1797275	So we can tell you how things are now, but unforeseen circumstances will push things back.
1797495	1798315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1826045	1832610	Also, we'll be getting Hour of Victory on the Xbox 360, yet another World War II first-person shooter.
1834091	1840896	Also, Blacksite Area 51, also scheduled for September, September 12th, on PlayStation 3 and 360.
1841357	1844219	Also, in September, Unreal Tournament 3 on the 360.
1845780	1846661	That's the 19th.
1846961	1851244	And then Mortal Kombat's coming out on the DS on October 17th.
1851304	1851384	Why?
1851605	1851885	Why?
1855287	1855988	Because they can.
1856008	1858171	I mean, has there ever been a good handheld Mortal Kombat?
1858331	1858611	Ever?
1859152	1859352	Ever?
1859913	1861595	Um, if you have a Nomad.
1863157	1863758	Okay, I don't.
1864198	1865881	Well, a Nomad's just a Genesis.
1866381	1867202	But you said handheld.
1867222	1867823	That's cheating.
1868043	1868424	No, it's not.
1868484	1869005	You cheated.
1869445	1870807	Anyways, um... You're a cheating cheater.
1871480	1874842	Also scheduled the same date, Wheelman on PlayStation 3 and 360.
1875482	1878243	That brand new Vin Diesel movie slash game.
1878763	1879564	That's going to be coming out.
1880304	1881865	Some other interesting stuff from Nintendo.
1881885	1885506	They're going to have the official Nintendo headset for the DS coming out April 22nd.
1886427	1887707	And a couple delays.
1887767	1889108	Well, actually, one delay here for you.
1889188	1892910	MLB 07, the show for the PlayStation 3, has been delayed to April 24th.
1892930	1893050	Yay.
1893070	1893130	Yay.
1896599	1897079	Lots of dates.
1897219	1898620	Alright, well thank you very much for those dates.
1899120	1901921	Looking in the chatroom, Fireboma says Mortal Kombat better be Wi-Fi.
1902922	1903982	Maybe that's the reason to have an idea.
1904002	1904803	I should take Dark Resurrection.
1905043	1905623	That's a good point.
1906083	1906783	Who said that?
1906803	1908224	That is a good point.
1908404	1914507	There was also Mortal Kombat Deceptions Unchained on the PSP that came out in November.
1915247	1918548	Alright, so I think back to those crappy Game Boy ones.
1918628	1918989	Come on.
1919169	1919929	Surely you played...
1920165	1920625	Orange Lounge Radio
1944719	1945900	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1975187	1981493	That's all you have, though, is there was a little teaser poster that just said Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2.
1982073	1982834	It's really all we know.
1982894	1985416	It's coming, but that's a good sign.
1985796	1987137	Are you surprised?
1988839	1991160	For me, yes, because it's arcade.
1991220	1994303	If this was a home version, no, that's not a surprise at all.
1994670	2011174	But as far as a arcade release goes, yeah, I think it is a little bit of a surprise because of the fact that DDR took such a long break, I think, to get a new game announced so quickly, despite the rumors of the 200, 300 song expansion, whatever it is, which is probably this, that, you know, I think it's great.
2011749	2014170	I wonder what that says, because I can't read Japanese, obviously.
2014230	2018191	So it says 2000, I wonder if it's like spring, fall, you know, summer.
2018211	2022973	Let me give it a look, but I will do that after I deliver some other news to us.
2023013	2030776	And why the hell does this look like, I want to say, like some crappy Pokemon logo or something.
2031456	2032397	Where's the damn poster?
2032677	2034157	Because Pokemon's very lame.
2036378	2038239	Chris has problems with you calling Pokemon lame.
2039077	2044301	Pokemon is the only game that I really, truly loved first.
2044321	2050325	You know, DDR Supernova 2, I think it's going to be a Jewish game if you notice there's almost like a Star of David in the background there.
2051726	2052346	Wow.
2052406	2057429	Our resident Jew in the room has made a face in regards to that.
2058390	2063733	Actually, Loki's married to a Jew, too, so he gets to make the jokes through proxy.
2066875	2067176	Okay.
2072130	2076093	He's into Judaism, if you know what I mean.
2076614	2083959	Marissa's boyfriend is half Japanese with a very Japanese mother, so she gets to make all the Japanese jokes, so she's okay by proxy, too.
2084139	2084539	There you go.
2084579	2084859	All right.
2085440	2085580	Good.
2086100	2088462	Do I get to make Jewish jokes because I know you?
2091284	2091624	Damn it.
2092330	2101013	Okay, I do believe that that says, looking at that, that is, I want to say Winter.
2102753	2105554	I'm pretty sure that that's the kanji for 2007 Winter.
2106774	2109915	Kyle Snyder's in chat, who's somewhat of a well-known DDR persona.
2109975	2110656	Hi, Kyle!
2110736	2113156	And he thinks the following will show up in Supernova 2.
2113216	2115077	These are the official Kyle Snyder predictions.
2115197	2121999	Fly Away Remix, Stargate Heaven, Future Love Mix, Flow, Jam & Reggae Mix, VJ Army, G2, and Outer Limits.
2122757	2124759	I wouldn't mind if DJ Ranma showed up.
2124819	2125619	That would be rad.
2126320	2126640	Alright.
2126820	2132264	Well, you know what else is absolutely, completely, 100% rad and even more super cool than DDR?
2132485	2132685	Me.
2133645	2133926	Me!
2134306	2135727	Your mom is cooler than DDR.
2136227	2137568	Which is true because I like your mom.
2137588	2138189	Your mom's really cool.
2140210	2140591	Okay.
2140671	2142993	But not in a, you know... Not in a homosexual way.
2143013	2144113	Not in an MILF way.
2144294	2144594	Okay.
2145755	2146055	Alright.
2146836	2151879	Um, but, uh, Silent Hill is coming to the arcade, and yes, I know, everybody already knows about it, so shut up.
2153881	2157203	There is... Orange Lounge Radio, reporting the news you already know about.
2159024	2173453	There is, uh, Silent Hill, um, in development for the arcade, um, not really major, too much about it out, it's just called Silent Hill the Arcade, um, supposed to be a gun game with a big curtain around it, and... Ooh, Pyramid Head.
2175535	2175995	But, um...
2176781	2177782	It looks really blurry.
2178522	2181043	Well, I'm thinking it's just going for the look of Silent Hill.
2181063	2183765	Like, it's probably going to be foggy and have that whole ambience to it.
2183805	2185966	I'm sorry, the PlayStation 2 looked better than that.
2186627	2187447	That curtain's got to go.
2187467	2189448	That curtain isn't going to last.
2190029	2191750	That curtain that's on the thing, though, yeah.
2192030	2195091	Little kids at Golf Land will rip that shit off in five seconds.
2195572	2201495	But my whole fear regarding this, though, is that it's going to turn and it's going to be like a House of the Dead clone and it better not be.
2201915	2204897	Or I will personally go to Konami of Japan with a tank.
2205637	2206478	I will tape that.
2207399	2210361	If Akira Yamaoka has anything to do with this, I'm okay with it.
2210621	2212102	Because I know, I respect that man so much.
2212183	2215945	If it's really cool, I will personally, I mean, hug him.
2217987	2220248	Marissa, you a big Silent Hill, you a Silent Hill fan?
2220268	2222230	I'm sorry, Chris, I'm not making it up to you.
2222790	2227814	I don't go see a lot of movies, not because I'm a hermit, because I don't like paying $8 and seeing a movie that sucks.
2228314	2231616	I drive my feet stick to the floor and smell a vomit or whatever else goes on in the theater.
2233567	2235727	So, I haven't seen a lot of movies.
2235747	2236728	Do you like scary games?
2236988	2238568	You ever thought about playing a scary video game?
2239008	2243269	I was the best girlfriend in the world when I bought my boyfriend, who couldn't afford anything.
2243909	2247290	I bought him a... Neither could I, technically.
2247530	2251451	I bought him a GameCube and... Goddammit, I'm having a total... Eternal Darkness.
2251571	2251791	Nope.
2251931	2252411	Resident Evil 4.
2252911	2255391	I bought him Resident Evil for the GameCube and he just had a heart attack.
2255411	2256452	This ain't a cutscene!
2256792	2257772	Resident Evil!
2258484	2259084	Very cool.
2259745	2263526	I like the suspenseful games, but sometimes they can just piss you off.
2264907	2267108	And make you want to kill something, like in the game.
2267128	2268848	Like Trauma Center.
2268868	2270129	Trauma Center is amazing.
2270189	2273750	Trauma Center makes you want to kill things.
2273790	2276151	Stab your knife into the patient.
2276271	2279092	I love, that's my favorite thing to do when I get frustrated in Trauma Centers.
2279133	2280173	I just whip out the scalpel and go...
2282856	2287398	You know what I like to do in trauma center now that I'm in school to be a massage therapist?
2287438	2288538	Let's begin the operation.
2289179	2291900	I like tracing out their muscles because I know where they are now.
2292801	2294461	Blaze says trauma center equals love.
2294821	2298743	By the way, just because I'm proud of myself, I made a 92 on my anatomy test.
2299304	2300244	Yay!
2300604	2301325	Back to games.
2302205	2304386	Hey, can I get some technical geek on?
2304546	2305186	Is that a SM58?
2305206	2305607	Do we have...
2308064	2309365	I have no idea.
2309445	2312645	I totally know how to relax the piriformis when you have sciatic pain.
2313786	2317446	Speaking of Silent Hill, when does this come out?
2318107	2318467	Do we know?
2319547	2322088	I did know, and then I closed the article.
2324408	2324968	Let me down.
2325568	2326549	No!
2327329	2328909	No, they don't actually say.
2328929	2331910	I just hope the curtain was just to protect...
2332847	2334948	The Press at this arcade show because that curtain is so ugly.
2334988	2337209	It would only be in America that the curtain would be in anything.
2337249	2341030	The curtain was basically to give it a dark, eerie feeling.
2341070	2342891	That's what the reasoning for the curtain is.
2342911	2345892	The curtain gives you the feeling of playing it in a hefty bag.
2345992	2348273	That's what the curtain gives you the feeling of.
2348293	2348893	You know what?
2348953	2354075	If they want to really make it a thing, they should do it like how that crap-tastic Jurassic Park game is.
2355876	2356696	Where you can sit down.
2358997	2359677	All I want to do is...
2362193	2367278	If they come out with the typing of the Silent Hill... No, it would be Silent Hill the typing.
2367518	2374003	I will retire from video game everything because everything I need in the world has been done.
2374304	2376265	I still play Typing of the Dead.
2376666	2380129	What if it were like Guitar Freaks crossed with Silent Hill?
2380249	2380990	That's stupid.
2382951	2383792	It would be keytar.
2383812	2385073	Pyramid Head rocks out.
2385333	2388296	No, you have to fight them with the power of rock.
2388570	2390612	No, it would be, it would, I got it, I got it.
2390632	2392273	That's Guitaruman gone lame.
2392453	2394574	No, it'd be, we should have SilentKitar.
2398677	2399978	Cassio the Shooting!
2399998	2402260	You can kill them with hollow notes, okay?
2402280	2403581	That's what you can do.
2403681	2405983	Speaking of... Dude, you can kill anyone with hollow notes.
2407544	2410306	Speaking of... If you really want to go for the murder, sorry.
2410566	2412567	Speaking of slightly lame, let's talk about Tekken 6.
2413695	2415696	Yes, Tekken 6 is slightly lame.
2415816	2416076	Why?
2416136	2419758	Because the screenshots and the trailer that they've shown of it look kind of lame.
2420099	2423240	And not even really up to par to Virtua Fighter 5.
2423761	2427243	But nonetheless, we'll be coming to arcades soon.
2427823	2431665	And we'll be featuring also two new characters, Leo and Zafina.
2432545	2435127	Both which look very generic.
2435667	2437068	So, hooray.
2437428	2442411	But it looks like it will have the same visual quality of Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection...
2443426	2447868	and, um... Okay, um, wait, wait, what were the characters' names again?
2447908	2448208	Leo?
2448648	2449569	Leo and Zafina.
2449669	2456011	Okay, now keep in mind, I've never seen pictures of these characters, I don't even know if they've leaked out, but I'm gonna make some bold predictions, okay, knowing the Tekken series.
2456411	2462334	I'm gonna say Leo is shirtless, and Jamina, or whatever her name, Jamigla?
2462354	2462714	Zafina.
2462954	2463454	Zafina?
2463894	2464475	Serafina?
2465075	2469017	Serafina has humongous breasts that will bounce.
2469597	2469857	Okay.
2470712	2474273	You're wrong about shirtless.
2474333	2475854	Every character in Tekken is shirtless.
2475954	2477854	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2477914	2479855	He's been one of the chicks, I think.
2480235	2489758	Leo looks like a chick, who also looks like someone that was ripped from Final Fantasy X. No, Leo looks like one of the Bogards, a little bit.
2490078	2491639	Okay, Leo looks like a chick.
2491859	2494660	Anyways, and then... That's a guy.
2495160	2495480	And then...
2495905	2496725	and Zafina.
2497326	2506030	Zafina, well, she's your chick that's, you know, of course she has big boobs, but she's your... One out of two ain't bad.
2506050	2506590	Your ethnic chick.
2506610	2507851	What, is she a belly dancer?
2507891	2508551	What the hell is that?
2508571	2508751	Probably.
2508771	2509812	She's wearing a sarong.
2510332	2510952	I don't know.
2512153	2514594	Well, easy access, I suppose.
2515535	2516635	Either way, it looks kind of neat.
2516695	2522258	They're going to have... It looks like from the trailer, they're going to have different ways you can kind of build up your characters.
2523986	2528428	I don't know, it looks okay, but do you really need to push better graphics with fighting games?
2528448	2529088	Just make it fun.
2529108	2529609	Yay.
2529629	2530649	I'm yay for that, actually.
2531810	2532970	Marissa says she's yay for that.
2534531	2541035	Although they do need to push more boob physics with Dead or Alive 3, or Dead or Alive 5, I guess it would be.
2541535	2542816	Jamie, you're a Tekken fan girl.
2543016	2547178	Are you excited about Tekken 6, or is this a little too much of one thing, or what?
2547697	2551440	I'm always excited over anything that has gin in it.
2551460	2553681	Yeah, I was going to say, as long as gin's in it, right?
2554261	2559045	And Asuka now, because Asuka's kind of... Wait here, I'm going to write a letter on Jamie's behalf to Namco.
2560406	2563668	Dear Namco... May I?
2563888	2564528	Namco Bondi.
2566990	2568591	Sit down, shut up, let me speak.
2568691	2569191	Okay, here we go.
2569271	2570232	Rob, you talk too much.
2570252	2571453	Dear... I know.
2571793	2573414	Even our fans think so, too.
2573454	2574155	No, I know, it's fine.
2574175	2574455	You know what...
2574966	2576027	Okay, then here's my letter.
2576067	2577368	Dear fans, suck it.
2577568	2578469	All right, here we go.
2578489	2579230	Back to Jamie's letter.
2579250	2579990	That's G4.
2580251	2586136	Dear Namco Bandai, Jin!
2586156	2587597	Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, Jin!
2587657	2588198	Oh my god, oh my god!
2588218	2589459	No, no, no, no, no.
2589499	2590400	Love, Jamie.
2592942	2596545	My obsession has also carried over to Asuka.
2597706	2598086	P.S.
2598527	2599147	Asuka!
2599167	2600268	P.S.
2600348	2600949	Oh my god, boobs.
2602510	2604430	Mike W says, my ears bleed.
2604471	2605951	Rondo of Blood, the fighting game.
2606291	2607991	Fireboma says, write it in blood.
2609212	2611712	Uni says, I'm going to smack Rob for not being nice to DS.
2612252	2612852	I bite back.
2614373	2617974	For the record, I'm so sick of how many shadows your game can fucking render if it still sucks.
2619694	2620374	For the record.
2620754	2624835	That's how we feel, but we don't know how to put it so eloquently to the developers.
2625075	2627256	Would you like to write a letter to the developers of games?
2627396	2628216	What if I went like that?
2628576	2628816	All right.
2629616	2635058	It's like, great, now you have a really shiny, highly rendered piece of shit instead of just, you know.
2636018	2638179	That dookie looks mighty fine.
2638219	2641500	I mean, I can see, like, it's obvious you ate corn.
2642440	2646321	It's like, wow, she looks really lifelike.
2646361	2651223	Too bad that she clips through people and is stuck in the stage or something.
2651243	2655804	I love the Blood Elves in World of Warcraft because they, like, levitate over bridges because the clipping is so awful.
2655884	2657505	Anyway, let's
2658432	2659573	In certain places they do.
2660054	2660314	They do.
2660554	2661034	Alright, anyhow.
2661515	2663376	Let's talk about something very sexy.
2664497	2665878	Besides me.
2666058	2668880	Ikaruga is a shooter game.
2668900	2670261	You know Ikaruga, right?
2670341	2672923	It's like the one where you... Radiant Silvergun, the sequel.
2672943	2678348	Well, you press buttons to change the color of your shield because there's like red bullets and I think it was purple bullets and red bullets.
2678428	2682090	It's like black and white, but the black is kind of purplish.
2682130	2682931	It's so awesome.
2683792	2685173	You have these bullets and you change the shield color.
2685193	2686053	It's such a great shooter.
2686073	2686113	Uh...
2687492	2688753	XBOX 360 DEBUG UNIT PARTNER NET
2714474	2743583	Icaruga that is just like so well I'll tell you something else though that's relatively sexy that is if you are a big collector like me and um a skew has shown up at GameCrazy which I cannot confirm for my husband's GameCrazy because he hasn't seen fit to tell me sorry for a black Xbox 360 and it has been confirmed by several GameCrazy's isn't this like the fourth week in a row there's been some type of black Xbox 360 story on the internet
2743837	2744737	DarkSakura, why?
2744757	2745978	The original Xbox was black.
2745998	2746979	But we had the Halo one.
2773459	2774839	Yeah, but here's the thing, though, about it.
2774919	2777040	I think it's not really the fact that it's black.
2777280	2781940	It's just that it's going to have a 128-gig hard drive, supposedly, and they think that's also going to have an HDMI out.
2783061	2785061	I can tell you right now... And a bigger penis.
2785301	2789522	I can tell you right now, either way, it's just going to be a disappointment.
2789582	2792542	That's all it's going to be is a big disappointment for you.
2793102	2794123	So, great.
2794143	2794903	They're going to announce that.
2794943	2800484	They're going to announce a 512 card or a memory unit or whatever, and everybody's like, Oh, yay!
2800524	2802664	We can download more crap.
2802684	2802764	Yeah.
2805418	2811744	I'm sorry, I just had to weigh in on this subject because I think Nintendo, it's the stupidest thing in the world, but I think they made a big mistake with the GameCube.
2811964	2814646	I actually got my ex the GameCube, but they made it purple.
2815287	2817829	Because guys were afraid of having a purple GameCube.
2817909	2820291	Hey, be glad that we didn't get the orange one.
2820371	2821092	Mine was silver.
2821232	2823935	It was indigo, okay?
2825316	2827978	It was blue, and by the way, I had the black ones.
2828018	2828959	In Japan they had orange ones.
2828979	2829880	That makes you extra hetero.
2830768	2834489	Tiger Claw says, Sky, you know that old saying, once you go black, you never go back.
2835349	2836490	Is that true, DarkSakura?
2836530	2838750	Is that why you need the black Xbox 360 so bad?
2839031	2840251	I want it to match my Saturn.
2841951	2842692	Among other things.
2842852	2852815	Here's the thing, though, about, you know, you're going to get this nice, fancy, black Xbox 360, and then, oh, wait, the controllers are white, the Xbox HD, you know, DVD player is white.
2853215	2855495	Oh, wait, the remote's white.
2856416	2860417	I really don't give two shits, maybe half of one, but, you know, it's...
2861616	2867633	For people who say, you know, fine, you've got a new one, but whatever.
2868637	2873800	And for the record, the Sega Saturn did initially come out in white in Japan.
2873920	2875301	Check your sources!
2875601	2879203	James Patrick asks in chat, DarkSakura should sell the Halo one.
2879224	2880684	They're worth a bit of money now.
2880784	2881365	The fuck I will.
2881825	2882065	I know.
2882766	2884166	I have a Halo one as well.
2884927	2885887	Why would I sell it?
2885968	2887528	What would I play my Xbox games on?
2887648	2893892	Keep in mind, if I sell my Xbox, that drops me down to 42 video game systems.
2894092	2895193	I have an orange one.
2895693	2896954	But 42 is the answer to everything.
2897527	2902090	Gaming Nerd says, I'd love a nice pink 360 to match my pink PS2.
2903210	2905692	In related news, Gaming Nerd is my favorite chatter ever.
2908833	2916337	Actually, when I replace my JPS2, I'm going to get the Sakura PS2, which is sort of a purpley color.
2918238	2919759	And it's the Sakura one, so it's mine!
2921680	2922141	Mine.
2922161	2922861	Mine.
2923792	2925574	I do, I have my own brand of condoms.
2925615	2927277	Speaking of partner, Nat, a little bit.
2927297	2929740	What?
2929880	2931021	Did she say that in a mic?
2931261	2931802	Yes, I did.
2932743	2935567	Okay, I've got to tell you this.
2935587	2937289	This is completely off the subject, but I've got to say it.
2937840	2939622	I have my own brand of condoms!
2939642	2939742	What?!
2939762	2940462	No, pass the mic to Chris.
2962528	2967611	We were, uh, Jamie and I, when we hang out, we go down to Japan Town, and we go to, uh, Ichiban Con.
2967651	2968211	Ichiban Con.
2968271	2969132	Ichiban Con, thank you.
2969632	2973934	And, uh, they've got a bunch of imports from Japan, and one time we found Sakura condoms.
2974174	2975815	Like, Jamie, look, your condoms!
2975875	2978717	And Chris said that, and I repeated what she said, only I had the mic in my hand.
2979317	2979557	Yeah, see?
2979577	2981698	So that wasn't random, you just weren't paying attention.
2981718	2982739	I'm a bad host!
2982759	2983579	Hold on, hold on.
2983659	2984560	Bad host.
2984580	2985680	Whatever, whatever.
2986321	2987762	Those are Sakura brand, those are not dark.
2987782	2988982	That's one third of your show, too.
2989402	2990343	But they were in a dark box.
2991781	2992962	That does not count.
2993002	2993762	Yes, it does.
2994062	2995663	That's just like saying, okay.
2996964	2999946	That would be just like saying, oh, the Whitman chocolates out there.
3000166	3003768	Oh, they must be my brand chocolates because it's very close to my last name, White Man.
3003788	3005790	Or that's like saying, go outside and look up.
3005950	3007231	It's me, Sky.
3009692	3010373	You could do that.
3012634	3013014	Anyways.
3013194	3015956	That also put you in the category of I invented the internet.
3016016	3017337	By the way, I am everywhere.
3019461	3020962	Sorry, Loki, you had something you wanted to say.
3020982	3021422	Are you finished?
3021442	3022042	Yes, we're finished.
3022242	3022522	Thank you.
3023463	3024623	So let's talk about PartnerNet.
3024663	3032847	PartnerNet's been around forever, and I guess everybody forgot their NDAs regarding PartnerNet because you do not talk about PartnerNet.
3032867	3034347	That's the first rule of PartnerNet.
3035188	3038629	Yeah, right.
3038729	3042611	Everyone I know who's ever had PartnerNet, which isn't us because we're not cool enough,
3043415	3045897	They blab PartnerNet.
3045957	3049319	We know enough that you don't post it on blogs and things, but oh god.
3050239	3051540	People who have PartnerNet don't shut up.
3051760	3055022	They think they're special.
3055182	3059384	Someone took some video of it and they found out about more games coming out.
3059865	3061726	None of which I'm too surprised about.
3061786	3062946	Some of these have already been announced.
3063006	3065948	Rare's Jetpack, a game that's coming out later on.
3065968	3066789	They've already announced that.
3066849	3068790	Juice 2007, already been announced.
3069350	3071111	Absolute, who the hell knows what that is.
3071611	3072792	Ob's Pinball, yay.
3073237	3073817	Two Pinball.
3074297	3080800	Tetris Online, which I think might actually be that Tetris Evolution or whatever that's coming out in March, whatever.
3081680	3083181	Or maybe another downloadable game.
3083221	3084361	Great, two different Tetrises.
3084961	3087742	And then some Halo 2 maps that were already announced.
3087822	3090463	So, yeah, very exciting.
3092724	3093004	Great.
3093504	3093704	Great.
3094184	3095325	More stuff coming out.
3095465	3096665	Like I said, you can't talk about it, though.
3097085	3098246	Although there are other websites.
3098266	3101647	So I was reading some comments that they were posting about
3102409	3102889	That's great.
3102909	3106672	Yeah, apparently one of the bigger sites that had a movie got asked to take it down.
3106692	3107012	Ooh, snap.
3107092	3107352	Anyhow.
3127762	3128282	XBOX REWARDS CHALLENGE
3156615	3162218	Xbox's little concession for this whole thing is that they have extended the Xbox reward challenge by three days.
3162558	3165520	So you have three whole more days to extend your gamer score by 1,500 points.
3165920	3179328	And people are bitching and complaining because they were like, dude, I took the day off of work so I could be the first to inflate my gamer score so I could make sure that I'm one of the ones that gets this game because you only said so many copies would be out there.
3179668	3185591	And I'm saying if this is you, my personal opinion of you is that you need to go out and get a fucking life because seriously?
3186328	3192231	If you took a day off of work to stay home and increase your gamerscore for this competition, Microsoft does not owe you anything.
3193032	3194673	Microsoft made the game.
3195013	3196414	Microsoft made the system.
3196474	3197395	That is what you bought.
3197695	3201637	This whole rewards thing is like somebody giving you something for free.
3202118	3203619	Microsoft did not owe you this.
3204239	3205700	Why are you so mad over this?
3205800	3207601	That's why I refuse to get mad about this.
3207681	3210303	I mean, yeah, it was a little frustrating because I tried to go on the site, but it's like, you know what?
3210363	3211503	It's free stuff.
3211664	3216226	Quit your bitching and get like one of those diamond cards for free and then go get discounts at other places.
3216306	3222010	Or go get a whore and have sex and get some of that energy out of your system because seriously, if you're getting that
3222369	3222949	Thanks for watching!
3236914	3264558	I'm sure people know that Fuse and Frenzy 2 is not even worth it so I can think of no other reason why people want to do this other than to say look at my giant internet cock I got the free game in the Microsoft contest and let me be the first to tell you it's just like you got into the Halo 3 beta fucking everyone got into the Halo 3 beta who cares my girlfriend's cock is bigger than yours it is
3265956	3266477	You know what, though?
3266817	3276801	If I went to somebody's house and they have that on display, that's not unlike... Well, I have a friend that owns a magic card shop and they show me those player cards, you know, with the pictures of the expert magic player.
3276901	3279322	It's like a guide of who not to have sex with.
3282884	3284045	I'm sorry, it is.
3285505	3285765	Anyway...
3288153	3295515	I mean, I think Marissa, I see Marissa speaking for, like, the girls who are, like, kind of just not really associated with video games.
3295555	3297715	She's, like, from the outside, oh, okay, well, DS is cool.
3298296	3305997	And, you know, so she comes in and sees, you know, a bunch of people freaking out over video games, and she goes, wow, I'm not fucking them.
3306217	3311879	Well, who gives a crap if, you know, they don't want to have, or they're not going to get, you know, laid by a girl.
3312359	3316400	That cuts into precious time that they could be earning more gamerscore points.
3316520	3316820	Oh, no.
3317660	3320784	One is, okay, everyone I've dated has been a nerd, okay?
3320804	3327132	This is all on the record if anyone out there knows Kaylee, and that's just Kaylee, the big anime music video editor.
3327172	3328133	So I've put in my time.
3328954	3330056	And I'm a music nerd, okay?
3330076	3331377	That's all I have to say about that.
3332919	3334021	She's showing her creds.
3334401	3336304	She's literally whipping out her...
3337412	3340713	She's whipping out her cock and putting it on the table going, look.
3340933	3344074	I spent every day at school lunch in the library, okay?
3344234	3345774	I put in my nerd time.
3345874	3347114	I have put in my time.
3348715	3348995	All right.
3351335	3351655	Wow.
3351795	3352076	All right.
3352096	3354896	Well, anyway, that's all I have to say on the Xbox Rewards program.
3354916	3355716	Sorry for the little rant.
3356197	3357097	Well, you know what?
3357157	3358077	That's pretty shitty.
3358237	3362178	However, speaking of Microsoft and shitty, but not in a... Okay.
3362958	3365339	I should say Microsoft and shitty, but, like, not shitty.
3366159	3366239	Um...
3367532	3370096	We've been discussing Forza 2 lately.
3370136	3372360	The release date is in May in the United States.
3373201	3379350	It has been confirmed that it will be released in the UK in May this year.
3379731	3379931	So...
3381866	3385229	Just to give a little bit of background on that, there are going to be a lot of different cars in this.
3385249	3391134	There are 15 Ferraris, 2 Maseratis, 5 Lamborghinis, 13 Porsches.
3394217	3395518	Pretty much a lot of good stuff.
3395538	3399281	There's actually going to have the 1987 Porsche 959 in there, so that's pretty cool.
3399962	3403685	So it's looking like a pretty cool racing game if you're into that sort of thing.
3403925	3408309	And it will, again, have a May release in the UK as well as in the US.
3408669	3409550	The PAL version, sorry.
3411337	3412420	Isn't that nice?
3413662	3414704	That's pretty awesome.
3415987	3420557	And, of course, we're getting a lot more releases over here as well, not just
3421035	3423416	You know, Forza 2, which still weighs off.
3423656	3427618	This week, though, we've got some good stuff, including brand new Wii games.
3428278	3437762	Sonic and the Secret Rings is going to be finally heading over to us, so hopefully that one won't suck as bad as... I don't know much about this Sonic, but will it redeem the series?
3438163	3442345	It looks, to be honest, it looks just like the older Sonic games.
3442565	3445226	So I think that this will actually be...
3445786	3446567	Pretty decent.
3446807	3458940	I haven't played it, though, so I can't say the control issues are going to still be there, even with the Wii being a brand new system and stuff and new control sets.
3460752	3461072	I hope.
3461373	3461633	I hope.
3461713	3465095	It looks like it has some party games in it that are pretty fun, so hopefully.
3465896	3470820	Other stuff coming out, though, we're going to have Virtua Fighter 5 on the PlayStation 3.
3471860	3473742	That's going to be coming out this week, which is pretty awesome.
3473942	3479326	On the 360, the game I've been playing, and you've got to pick it up, Crackdown, as well.
3480186	3483169	Also on the 360, there's going to be NBA Street Homecourt.
3484009	3485050	That one's going to be pretty awesome.
3486006	3492908	on the PlayStation 2 Arena Football 2 Road to Glory, if you're into that alternative type of game.
3493928	3500090	Then, of course, on the PC here, we've got, what was it, Supreme Commander.
3501591	3502251	Let's see here.
3502371	3504232	Yeah, Supreme Commander on PC.
3504952	3509733	On the PlayStation 3 download service, Flow is supposed to finally make its way on the 22nd.
3509753	3510253	Let's see here.
3513223	3518346	On the DS, Azuna, Legend of the Unemployed Ninja, which should be pretty interesting.
3519106	3521948	And then also on PC, Warfront Turning Point.
3523569	3529172	And also, that's about it as far as the good stuff.
3530793	3535796	Alright, well, moving on over to Japan, where the video games come from a lot of times.
3536746	3541387	But also, you know, especially when it comes to Xbox 360, the US kind of gets them first usually.
3541687	3546688	But it looks like they're doing a simultaneous release with Riot Act, which is what they're going to call Crackdown over in Japan.
3547048	3549368	Riot Act is coming out this week over in Japan.
3549928	3554829	Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent also gets a release on the 22nd of February this week in Japan.
3555469	3560890	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Spike is putting out, not the same, like Spike TV here, it's a different company.
3561470	3565271	Untold Legends Dark Kingdom makes its way to Japan on the PlayStation 3.
3566275	3569496	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii Fire Emblem for the Wii.
3569536	3570597	That should be really interesting.
3571197	3575178	Also, Naruto Shippuden, Gekito Ninja Taisen.
3575498	3576739	That should be interesting.
3576899	3578399	Coming out on February 22nd.
3579280	3582601	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, you get a whole lot of stuff over in Japan.
3582921	3586542	What I thought was interesting, though, is that they're getting Destroy All Humans on the PlayStation 2.
3586662	3590824	So, a game that was popular enough over here made its way over to Japan, so...
3591868	3592588	Lupin the Third.
3592628	3594849	There's a Lupin 3 coming out in Japan.
3594869	3596229	I love Lupin the Third.
3596729	3598690	There's a whole shitload of stuff on the PlayStation 2 this week.
3599430	3602711	Pachislot, like if you like pachinko and that kind of stuff, you get that as well.
3603691	3604151	Let's see.
3604351	3605911	The Prince of Tennis, Card Hunter.
3606692	3608432	Prince of Tennis is actually kind of a fun anime.
3609832	3610112	Let's see.
3610152	3611032	What about some other systems?
3611052	3612433	How about on the Nintendo DS?
3612873	3615994	You get Cats in Japan comes out.
3616054	3617554	SimCity DS as well.
3618067	3621649	and one of my favorite titles, although, oh, that's actually a US release date.
3621709	3622889	You didn't name this one, though, did you?
3623670	3625671	Izuna, Legend of the Unemployed Ninja.
3625931	3626271	Oh, did you?
3626311	3626671	I'm sorry.
3627632	3629192	I was out of the room for a second.
3629232	3631614	That's my favorite name of the week, and it's not even a Japanese game.
3633534	3634435	Let me check PSP.
3635095	3638357	No, it's about this ninja who goes around doing, like, odd jobs and stuff.
3640078	3646781	Over on the PSP, you get the Metal Slug Complete Collection in Japan, Monster Hunter Portable, and...
3648035	3652196	and Boku wa Koku Kansai-ken, Airport Hero.
3652816	3653676	I am something.
3655257	3656097	Airport Hero.
3656997	3657717	That's awesome.
3658558	3664359	I think that if the other one was already taken by the U.S., then I'm going to name that my favorite title of the week.
3664459	3665299	Airport Hero.
3665459	3668360	We should just get another Densha Dego.
3668920	3672201	It came with a controller so you could pilot a train.
3672748	3678712	My Airport Hero is a screening line that can actually move at a steady pace.
3678792	3683576	Instead of backing up, I have to wait 45 minutes to take my belt off to go through the x-ray.
3683736	3684236	Hey, Rob.
3684376	3684577	What?
3685217	3686038	Are we done with Japan?
3686078	3686698	Yeah, yeah, I'm done.
3686718	3687819	We have other countries!
3688760	3688920	Really?
3688940	3690221	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
3692923	3694784	We have our UK release date.
3694804	3697026	I always thought Canada was the 51st state.
3700008	3700288	Rob.
3700908	3701129	What?
3701389	3701629	Rob.
3702082	3702242	What?
3702662	3703283	Puerto Rico?
3703303	3704023	What's Puerto Rico?
3704083	3704663	I've never heard of it.
3705023	3705303	Rob.
3705523	3706844	Oh, wait, that's Ricky Martin's hometown.
3706864	3708685	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
3708725	3708985	What?
3710746	3711006	Oh, yeah.
3711426	3711766	Okay.
3712366	3712646	UK.
3713387	3714127	Yes, UK.
3715168	3719029	On the 22nd on the PlayStation 3, we have Qbert.
3719049	3720930	Which is funny because I have Qbert on the Atari 5200.
3720990	3722731	And the Clique Vision.
3723811	3726432	On the 23rd, 23, the number of coincidence.
3726852	3729173	We have Blitz the League on Xbox 360.
3729253	3730414	We have Crackdown...
3731147	3754923	We have Disney's Chicken Little Ace in action on the Wii Final Fantasy XII, which, shit, took forever Ghost Rider on PlayStation 2 and PSP Guilty Gear Dust Strikers on DS I love Guilty Gear Infernal on PC Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas on PSP and Hot Pixel on the 25th on PSP And that's it!
3755883	3759826	Well, okay, actually, on the 27th there's also Flipper Critters and Jade Empire but that's next week
3760120	3763362	Hot Pixel was that one PSP game that's kind of like WarioWare, right?
3763402	3766344	It's not coming out until August here, I think.
3766524	3766724	Really?
3766744	3768245	I was going to ask if it ever came out.
3768265	3769966	Hey, our UK friends get games first.
3770106	3770906	Wow, that's a first.
3771066	3771467	Good job.
3771487	3772387	Good job, UK.
3772847	3773428	Way to go.
3773488	3774809	Too bad the game didn't look that good.
3774829	3777390	Too bad the guy's kind of crazy.
3777450	3778271	He's like this old dude.
3778291	3778811	Oh, yeah, that's right.
3778831	3780832	He was talking to us, and he was kind of creepy.
3781212	3784934	I got his card, but I felt like... Well, he's not going to come on the show now.
3785014	3785395	Sorry.
3785415	3787276	I just called him creepy.
3787416	3788817	He has his own podcast, by the way.
3788937	3789257	Does he?
3789730	3790391	I bet it's creepy.
3791393	3801288	Anyways, so apparently in the UK there's this wonderful show called Watchdog that they investigate
3801886	3815318	You know, companies and stuff like that that have, you know, either defective products or, you know, they're... It's kind of like, I want to say there was something like this on Dateline or something where they investigate different businesses to make sure that they're up to par or whatever.
3815759	3824367	So they're investigating Microsoft about the Xbox 360 because apparently they're saying that they have received 248 complaints about faulty Xbox 360s.
3824407	3824447	Um...
3829893	3849672	and they're saying that the return rate was larger than Microsoft initially said and that the fact that the owners had to spend, or some of the owners had to spend around 80 pounds or about $156 to fix each of the units that just so happened to break after a year of purchasing the system.
3851794	3853716	You know, at the same time, I just...
3854928	3856229	Aren't they a little late on this?
3856630	3860293	Wasn't this whole Defective 360 story about a year ago?
3862154	3862455	I don't know.
3862595	3864776	It takes time to build these cases, though, don't forget.
3864837	3868520	And it is the UK, and everything's delayed, unfortunately, with them.
3869400	3882571	Anyways, so Microsoft, of course, responded saying that the claims made by the show are false, that the return rate of the Xbox 360 is significantly lower than the CE industry average of 3-5%.
3883939	3889523	Customer satisfaction is our highest priority, and we do everything that we can to take care of the gamers who may have problems with their consoles.
3890063	3895126	Anybody having an issue with their 360 should call customer service immediately so that we can help.
3895947	3903671	And, you know, to be honest, though, they did increase their warranty period for the 360, and I don't know, I think they're doing their part.
3903772	3907914	I mean, I would say, how are these 360s being broken?
3907974	3909175	I mean, if it's people, you know,
3910497	3921764	I still hear my customers talking about, oh yeah, this game came back scratch because there's a ring in it now because someone's jiggled their 360 while it's going and it carved a big ring into their disc.
3923125	3924346	So, people are dumb.
3926167	3928728	I thought the X meant I shake it.
3930429	3930629	What?
3930690	3932711	The system's not like the Wii controller?
3932751	3934052	It's not motion sensitive?
3934612	3937053	Actually, to be honest, the system is motion sensitive.
3937093	3939695	It will know if you're laying it flat or if you're laying it upright.
3941044	3942004	It's true, it's true.
3942744	3946625	But that's a little, yeah, that's a little tiny little bubble that does that probably.
3947045	3951827	Anyhow, speaking of watchdog agencies, the biggest watchdog of them all is the government.
3952447	3960589	And Sam Brownback is a senator, a Republican senator, and he's also somebody who is running for president in 2008.
3960869	3962689	Oh, really?
3962889	3963830	Surprise!
3964410	3968991	And he's exploring the Republican nomination for the president of the United States.
3970478	3976762	Sam Brownback is also one of the minds behind the Video Game Rating Act, and it has been reintroduced.
3977122	3981584	It was first introduced last September, but it is now being reintroduced for Senate.
3982264	3991169	If this was made law, what would happen is that the ESRB, you may remember us talking about this back in September, the ESRB would have to play the final build of a game from the beginning until
3991434	3995677	to the end until they could actually give it a rating.
3996018	3999441	Because I believe the way the ESRB works now, they're just filling out a questionnaire.
3999481	4002223	Maybe they play a little bit of the game, but that's about it, right?
4002503	4004405	Yeah, it's the same way the MPAA works.
4005005	4007047	And I don't see anyone cracking down the MPAA.
4007147	4009929	I think the movies and the games should be done the exact same way.
4010049	4010449	Why not?
4010850	4011250	Why not?
4011690	4012751	Actually, no, I take that back.
4012771	4016875	I think movies, TV, and games should all be done the exact same way.
4017015	4017355	Why not?
4018021	4020682	And I like how these... Oh, anyways, continue on with the story.
4020722	4022784	Let me give a quick quote, and I think Marissa wants to chime in too.
4023464	4023644	Right?
4023904	4026606	Video game reviewers... Oh, this is a quote from Mr. Brownback.
4026906	4032009	Video game reviewers should be required to review the entire content of a game to ensure the accuracy of the rating.
4032349	4040513	The current video game rating system is not as accurate as it could be because reviewers do not see the full content of games and do not even play the games they rate.
4042434	4045576	Boy, they're going to be screwed when they have to review, like, Oblivion or an MMO.
4046505	4047226	Anyway, Marissa?
4047266	4049088	This issue in particular gets me really passionate.
4049168	4053373	I watched a great documentary called This Movie Is Not Yet Rated the other day about the MPAA.
4053413	4054194	I don't know if you've seen it.
4054485	4059807	I've heard of it and I really want to see it, but I've heard it's just like Super Size Me, like resonated with McDonald's.
4059847	4061688	I heard this movie resonated with the MVAA.
4062028	4068010	The government should not step in, but interestingly enough, I think there's a problem when the industry regulates itself because it creates a monopoly.
4068411	4075473	I don't understand, like for movies, for example, you can go to a website, kidsinmind.com, and it just lists specifically what is in the movie.
4075853	4079775	I don't think a rating system is a good idea because then people interject their opinion into it.
4079795	4081636	If you want to say there's sex in this, there's etc.,
4082396	4094050	and I know this is a really old meme, but it still amazed me that people got upset about the hot coffee mod in Grand Theft Auto, but they didn't have a problem with the fact that their five-year-old kid was killing hookers, etc.
4094091	4096694	Now, I like the game myself, but why is sex the problem?
4098314	4100235	Perfect example, the hot coffee thing.
4100355	4104937	I mean, granted, it was an interactive little minigame, whose graphics were really bad, by the way.
4105377	4113902	But yeah, I don't hear anyone complaining that there's a fucking sex minigame in the original God of War and in God of War 2, which there's full fucking titties in the goddamn game.
4114842	4116743	This wasn't, oh, it's not hidden.
4116803	4117303	Big deal.
4117403	4118304	It's an M-rated game.
4118544	4122586	The difference between a 17- and 18-year-old, can you really say mindset-wise?
4122646	4125067	I mean, granted, okay, one's a legal adult.
4125407	4129010	But mindset-wise, one's going to know about boobies as much as the other one.
4129030	4134695	That's because they need to pull the corncob out of their ass and stop fucking promoting a double fucking standard.
4134775	4138698	How would you feel if the video game was the exact same thing as the movie?
4138738	4140500	You pick up the box and on the back it says...
4140820	4143641	This game is rated R for sexuality and language.
4143721	4145762	And it still says sexual content.
4145822	4146762	Isn't that how they do it in Europe?
4146842	4148223	Yeah, in the UK it's the same system.
4148243	4151944	Okay, it said it was rated M for sexual content.
4152064	4152944	It was on there.
4153504	4156766	It didn't specify saying, oh, it's rated because of this minigame.
4157106	4158286	It said sexual content.
4158686	4165989	So this is really getting... Now you're starting to get into semantics here about, oh, well, is this sexual content that made it M rated and not this sexual content?
4166209	4167029	Who gives a shit?
4167149	4169550	It's M. It says sexual content.
4170580	4171861	Do we need to do anything else?
4172041	4172261	No.
4172621	4172941	You know what?
4172981	4181426	People are stupid and there's a lot of... No, I'm not saying this about everybody because we have parents that listen to this program and you're probably smart because you know how to download a podcast.
4181807	4187150	But there's a lot of stupid parents out there and for their benefit, you know, I'm going to give a little here.
4187190	4189091	It's about the world works with compromise, right?
4189791	4196815	My compromise is, okay, we will make one rating system so you don't have to think like, okay, I'm not that smart so I have to translate.
4196855	4198896	An M means like an NC-17, okay?
4200342	4202343	Let's use one rating system across the board.
4202624	4203484	That's my compromise.
4203985	4206506	That's why you stupid people don't have to memorize more than one system.
4206526	4208508	I'm pretty sure that's how they do it in Europe, isn't it?
4209168	4210509	And that makes perfect sense.
4211370	4228762	You know, as actually, it's funny, sort of related to that, our good friend Rob with 2Bs, I wasn't going to cover this in the mailbag, but he sent me an article about parents pursuing MySpace for their daughter's
4229349	4230530	Lying about being 18.
4231070	4232551	Sue your daughter!
4232571	4233412	My sister says she's 19.
4233512	4234873	I'm not finished.
4236214	4241538	And their daughter going to meet up with this guy and then getting the hot nookie on and the parent was sued.
4242079	4247042	Well, as the article states, the judge was like, fuck you, it was your job to police her.
4247422	4249744	That is the wrong person to be suing.
4249784	4250745	They need to sue the internet.
4251633	4252573	Internet is the blame.
4252593	4253894	Sue Al Gore for Inventigan.
4253954	4255775	Just to go ahead just a little bit into it.
4256515	4262557	A 12-year-old Texas girl lied about being 18, met a 19-year-old man for dinner at a movie and had some hot nookie.
4263117	4268099	And then the parents tried to sue MySpace for $30 million, accusing the site of negligence.
4268199	4276962	But the judge in the case, Judge Sam Sparks, turned around and I quote, If anyone had a duty to protect Julie Doe, it was her parents, not MySpace.
4277890	4280372	Alright, and Nestle, what's in Judge Sam Sparks?
4280692	4280872	Yep.
4281072	4284354	Judge Sam Sparks is our American Citizen of the Week.
4285115	4285895	Yay!
4289998	4293300	Our hats off to you for telling this parent to go fuck herself.
4293340	4301706	The reason why I think it was worth noting is that, you know, and actually Rob with two Bs also mentioned it,
4302310	4308656	that this might actually set a precedence now for future cases involving parental negligence.
4309317	4309697	I'm sorry.
4309737	4312801	I just get really passionate on this issue for being exceptionally yappy.
4313241	4324232	But, I mean, I agree with the idea of a rating system because it is unfair that children feel a lot of pressure nowadays to be hip and cool, etc., and they want the same things we do, which is a completely different rant of mine.
4324252	4324532	Sex?
4325093	4325733	Sex is cool, too.
4326710	4331211	It's a completely different rant of mine that we need to allow children to still be children and not little adults.
4331311	4339632	But anyway, my only beef with the rating system is, though, is that the G, PG, etc., that, again, is a personal opinion.
4340052	4355635	And actually, though, I think it makes it easier for parents, for those who approve of more sexual content because their own opinion or approve of less violence or more violence, etc., you just say explicitly what is in the game that is different than saying, well, I believe that this, because there's 12 different kinds of rated R movies.
4356295	4358277	So, there could be 12 different kinds of rated R games.
4377131	4379412	You know, there's a big, big difference.
4379452	4380653	Well, here's the other thing, too.
4380853	4386776	And I hate how they always say, oh, well, we need to put more responsibility on, you know, the ESRB and rating these games.
4386796	4392999	No, you have to put more responsibility on these parents who just ignore the ratings and they say, oh, I didn't know this content was in here.
4393039	4400583	Yeah, you didn't know because you didn't read and you bought it for your five-year-old because, you know, you'll do anything for your five-year-old and you won't even, you know, question it.
4400623	4404305	You'll just like, okay, I'm going to buy him... Buy him a fucking porno then.
4404345	4405246	I mean, seriously, if...
4406053	4408414	If that's going to be such an issue with you... Wow.
4408694	4414535	It's just... I don't understand... And I don't understand how... Okay, granted the content was hidden in the game.
4414695	4416215	Okay, yippee, it's hidden in the game.
4416735	4428258	So if I created, say, a series of GameShark codes or something like that and made a topless mod for Tomb Raider, you know, a very elaborate process I might add that would probably be...
4429966	4430827	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4448940	4449821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4466636	4470739	Did you know your child can do real fucking in Grand Theft Auto?
4471140	4473141	Like, power fucking with the X button.
4473501	4475323	You know, coming to Grand Theft Auto tonight on Xdrop.
4475983	4479106	You know, and it's like, I think parents go off of what they hear.
4479801	4481423	and not what they're actually seeing.
4481903	4485667	There's so much of that sensationalism that I think takes everything to the oomph degree.
4485927	4487149	I don't actually agree with that.
4487229	4493996	I'm just going to say this really quick because do you remember how big that Super Bowl thing with Janet Jackson was?
4494516	4498140	Her titty was on television for a half a second.
4498660	4500322	But it was covered.
4500442	4501163	It was covered.
4503769	4507950	It was covered with a stupid nipple shield.
4508210	4515273	I saw the exact same thing on fucking Girls Next Door where she has a stupid sticker over her nipple and then that was acceptable.
4515353	4516173	It wasn't a sticker.
4516193	4516973	It was actually a piercing.
4517133	4521735	Dude, my grandma came out once and didn't realize I was in the room and I didn't sue her.
4522115	4523395	Movies kill.
4523415	4524076	Movies kill.
4525656	4527457	It might have made me gay, but I didn't sue her.
4528037	4528537	I'm just kidding.
4529177	4529637	I don't want to.
4530158	4531298	That's not what made me gay.
4531398	4531498	It's
4532170	4533890	I firmly believe it's a biological thing.
4534311	4534551	Anyway.
4535791	4536631	Yeah, cock made me gay.
4538592	4540452	Alright, anyhow.
4541772	4544433	Ryoma in chat says, Sky, never talk about that again.
4544713	4545653	But I'm serious.
4545733	4549614	I mean, what kid didn't accidentally see a titty at some point, you know?
4550934	4552415	Yeah, or a dick, you know?
4553615	4555656	Duke Nukem had boobies in it too.
4556196	4559036	Yeah, pixelated 8-bit boobies.
4559256	4560577	I mean, that's what they look like.
4560597	4561577	That's hot.
4562871	4563151	All right.
4565133	4566934	Anyhow, moving on.
4568555	4573859	Every week we invite you to give your feedback here on our program through our mailbag, among other things.
4574280	4577222	We like to be an interactive program because it's not just about us.
4577262	4580184	It's not just about the three of us that run this program.
4580224	4583306	It's not just about Marissa or Chris or any of the other folks you've heard.
4583626	4585708	Chris thinks it's all about her, but it's actually not.
4586195	4597404	We invite you guys to interact with us by the chat room, by the voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or through the email bag, which you can email us every week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
4597424	4598665	We love getting your emails.
4599146	4601508	And DarkSakura, she's the queen of the mail bag.
4601848	4605351	She likes to jump in there and pull out some of her favorite emails.
4605371	4606091	She's going to do that right now.
4606111	4606852	I'm going to pull it out.
4616075	4620196	You should have said that on mic.
4620276	4623498	GS68 says, and you penetrate her weak point for massive damage.
4624678	4625598	Mailbag, please.
4626539	4627539	Alien crab bag.
4627659	4628059	I mean, wait.
4628639	4628879	Sorry.
4631120	4632240	WTB, mail.
4634721	4634961	Rob.
4635542	4635782	What?
4636162	4636482	Whatever.
4638643	4639183	Four emails.
4640263	4642044	The first one from...
4644252	4645833	I'm not sure exactly what to say.
4646233	4647693	Can we try something new tonight?
4648313	4654716	When you say that we're going to do the first email, what I'd like Chris to do is to say very sexily, letter number one.
4654896	4655656	All right, so here we go.
4655976	4657357	So can we start from the top, please?
4657437	4658217	All right, here we go.
4660458	4661298	Say the first email.
4662959	4663479	Okay, Chris.
4664419	4665680	Letter number one.
4666020	4666600	All right, very good.
4667455	4672759	Dear Rob, DarkSakura, and Loki, I just wanted to say hello to you all and tell you how much I enjoy your program.
4672799	4674580	I've been listening for a little over a year now.
4675080	4679383	I actually first found out about you guys when looking for websites that were optimized to view on my PSP.
4679784	4683446	Hint, hint, hint, hint!
4684006	4685547	Anyway, what's the deal with Rice Princess?
4685567	4687829	She has a filthy, filthy mouth and is incredibly offensive.
4688069	4689430	You should have her on the show more often.
4689810	4690511	Keep up the good work.
4691929	4692929	Is Rice Princess still here?
4693049	4694830	Let me go find Rice Princess.
4695030	4696891	Talk smack about Rice Princess quick before I get her in here.
4696911	4703674	Oh my god, Irene is so... I'm going to skip the... I'm going to go into the next email.
4704634	4706535	Email number two.
4708076	4709976	You sounded like you had to go to the bathroom.
4711857	4712337	Oh, wait a minute.
4712357	4715439	Rice Princess, we just read one of your fan letters on the program.
4715919	4717880	Is it true that you have an offensive, filthy mouth?
4718360	4718580	Fuck.
4719212	4721573	Do you know any dirty jokes you can tell our listeners this week?
4721813	4727736	Because our emailer said they liked having you on the show because you had a very offensive mouth, so we just wanted you to say something offensive.
4728196	4729617	Okay, poop.
4730838	4731618	That's pretty offensive.
4731638	4733639	That was on an offensive scale of 1 to 10.
4733679	4734560	That was like a 3.
4734920	4740803	Okay, how about you lick the crusty poop out of my butt, and then you lick the crusty poop off my finger?
4741163	4741943	Okay, I'm going to go.
4742364	4743124	Okay, that was a 9.
4743164	4743424	That was a 9.
4743464	4744284	That was much better.
4744385	4745585	All right, thank you, Rice Princess.
4745625	4747286	Thank you for your contributions.
4747639	4749680	It's a good thing we haven't done any more Yamama jokes.
4750061	4751422	Do you want me to do it again?
4752082	4752643	Yeah, you already did.
4754804	4755064	Okay.
4755184	4756405	I already did the email.
4757146	4761929	This one is email number two from SpeedyF40.
4763070	4767333	A year and a half ago I tuned into OLR for the first time after finding it on Podcast Alley.
4767473	4774618	I was not hooked, but like a festering rash, the good kind, your show grew on me and a year and a half later I am still here.
4776823	4778884	Orange Lounge Radio.
4779064	4781285	We're like the good kind of festering rash.
4781405	4783586	That's a really good compliment.
4783986	4787668	Rob, you guys are like the festering rash.
4787728	4790630	We are the festering rash of my love.
4791250	4797173	Could somebody who has not written a review on iTunes yet, somebody in chat, volunteer to do this.
4797193	4797894	I actually haven't.
4797974	4799915	I want somebody in chat to yell out, claim this.
4800235	4803817	Go to iTunes and give us a five-star review, which actually everyone should do.
4803997	4804357	Hint, hint.
4805070	4815654	I don't want everybody saying the show is a festering rash, so I want one person from chat to nominate themselves to go write a five-star review on iTunes and put, this show is the festering rash of gaming podcasts.
4816154	4816735	The good kind.
4816835	4817375	The good kind.
4817575	4821977	Genital herpes is forever, and so is my love for Orange Lounge.
4822017	4823797	Okay, somebody can lay claim to that one, too.
4823857	4824598	I like that one.
4824618	4825878	Can I finish reading this now?
4825998	4826658	Yes, you may.
4827319	4827639	Okay.
4827679	4828999	Fester, Jamie, fester.
4829079	4830540	Bite my butt, but not really.
4831300	4833321	and you have even used one of my calls on air.
4833862	4837644	I love independent radio and I feel that your show is doing a service to the gamer community.
4838085	4840346	OLR has even inspired me to do my own show.
4841147	4843869	Loki, you suck because you don't like Max.
4845830	4846911	No, that's really not what he said.
4850193	4850493	Okay.
4851714	4852355	He didn't say that.
4853433	4855173	I know some people may see you as an ass.
4855493	4857414	You are, just not all the time.
4857954	4860355	Most of the time I see you as an honest, down-to-earth realist.
4860515	4867236	Loki, you set the story straight, and your ties to the inside of the gaming world give the show a sense of added credibility.
4868296	4870097	By the way, apples do suck for gaming.
4870557	4871357	Buy a PC.
4872917	4877678	I would say in two to four years, Apple computers will be a formidable gaming computer for the average person.
4878038	4880699	Real gamers will stick with the PC, but that is a whole other thing.
4881411	4886013	Jamie, your alternative views on gaming and the gaming culture broaden my mind and keep ideas flowing through my head.
4886713	4890355	I love how you speak your mind, even though I know we will have some political differences.
4890455	4893396	I hold your opinions on issues that affect gamers in extremely high regards.
4893676	4894477	Well, thank you.
4894717	4896398	That makes me feel warm in a special place.
4896998	4898559	My ex-boyfriend actually had a good quote on that.
4898579	4902880	He said, Macintosh makes the best computer out there.
4903401	4904221	You know what the problem is?
4905622	4906122	Nobody cares.
4908677	4909778	Do you have another email, actually?
4910618	4911278	There's more.
4911519	4918482	Okay, I wanted to do the sexy announcement, because on the internet, I'm kind of geek famous for being the voice of a character on LJ Drama.
4919063	4919283	Okay.
4920043	4921524	All right, well, the third one is to Rob.
4921944	4922324	Oh, yay.
4922544	4925106	You got a lot of balls being a gay gamer on the internet.
4925186	4927507	Pun intended.
4928368	4932810	When I jumped on air for my own show, I would have to say that I model...
4934889	4937711	I model some of my on-air presence from yours.
4938251	4942792	With me being straight guy, I come off as being very enthusiastic.
4942872	4945013	I just don't get messages telling me I talk too much yet.
4947498	4948338	I love OLR.
4948378	4949819	It is polished and it is brilliant.
4950159	4954581	From your unconventional views on gaming and gaming culture to the straight-up format of the show, I love it.
4955041	4958742	I would not be who I am today on the internet and in real life if it was not for you guys.
4958782	4959803	Independent Radio for the win.
4959983	4960763	Speedy F40.
4960803	4961083	P.S.
4961423	4963704	Tell Rice Princess I have a crush on her because she sounds like a freak.
4964745	4964985	Wow.
4965025	4966305	Hey, Irene!
4967125	4968046	You have a fan!
4968986	4972267	That's very... Wait, didn't he say he ran his own podcast?
4972327	4972407	Yeah.
4972427	4972808	What is it?
4973108	4973768	I didn't say.
4973788	4975188	Is this his Speedy F40?
4975348	4976329	Is there like a signature or something?
4976349	4976749	I think it's a crush.
4976969	4979330	He has a crush on you because you're a freak, is what he said.
4979350	4980111	Because you're a freak.
4980211	4981051	SpeedyF40.
4981712	4988615	Dude, if you're listening, and we're pretty sure that you are because you're amazing, send us a link to your podcast and we'll plug you.
4988635	4988995	Totally.
4989155	4990436	We want to pimp that podcast.
4990476	4992917	We will totally plug you in the most awesome way.
4992977	5001482	Seriously, not to spend too much time talking about ourselves, because I don't want to be like that, but that's truly one of the best compliments we could ever get.
5001562	5002522	Oh, wait, it's on here.
5002542	5002983	Oh, it is?
5003203	5003643	Oh, great.
5004311	5007733	WCRadio.com 5pm Eastern Time on Saturday.
5008513	5013356	Oh, it's part of the WCRadio, Warcraft Radio, like a huge radio thing.
5013416	5013976	Yeah, isn't it?
5014196	5015317	Warcraft Radio?
5015337	5016978	I think I've heard of them before.
5017878	5025202	I'm not sure if this is his or not, but it's in the signature, so check it out maybe?
5025242	5030965	Hey, if you are going to spend all day playing World of Warcraft, I know the soundtrack gets old, so you might as well listen to Warcraft Radio, right?
5031265	5031865	So go for it.
5032326	5033026	That's very cool.
5033987	5063270	and that's truly one of the best compliments but can I say something about the gay issue without turning the show too gay it's already gay it's actually not really been a big deal for me to be gay on this program because I give a lot of props to the gaming community and I think the youth in general is that I really don't think people seem to care and I think if they do care they're not listening so hey, all for the best this probably isn't their type of show anyway if it was something they care about they'd probably want to listen to Bigot Radio
5063792	5073818	But most people that have listened to this program really don't care, and I think that speaks volumes about the gaming community, is that, you know, hey, there's nothing wrong with being gay, but it's just, you know, it's whatever.
5074038	5085265	But I don't want this to be the gay show either, because that's not all I am, and I think people get that wrong impression about me sometimes, is that, you know, I'm the gay gamer, and that's all I can think about is, like, how much cock is in my games.
5085565	5086486	At least you're not the titty queen.
5088584	5091285	Yeah, we plugged the lesbian thing on me just because it's funny.
5092505	5094025	It's for the straight men, you know.
5094345	5096706	This segment is getting entirely too gay.
5096726	5097446	Alright, sorry.
5097466	5098206	I just wanted to say it.
5098266	5099767	Talk about your joystick some more.
5099827	5100747	Wait, wait, sexy please.
5100867	5101787	Except that boobs are hot.
5102467	5105848	Oh, I was just going to say it's not all gay radio unless you talk about your joystick too much.
5105868	5108209	Oh, oh.
5108349	5111530	Hi, it's me, Victoria.
5112870	5114090	Email number three.
5115531	5116311	Dude, that was hot.
5116371	5116811	That was hot.
5117642	5118322	I got a semi.
5120564	5123586	Hey, OLR, I started World of Warcraft for the new year.
5123646	5127509	I fell in love with WoW until I installed the Burning Crusade expansion pack.
5127769	5128089	Oh, my God.
5128109	5128409	Oh, my God.
5129270	5131852	No, I would not interrupt you if this was not the best thing ever.
5131872	5132973	You interrupt me all the time.
5133013	5135254	No, I would not do this if this was not the best thing ever, DarkSakura.
5135274	5135534	Trust me.
5135835	5140258	DJ Janai says, maybe we should rename the show to the Games and You Show.
5140698	5142039	G-A-Y, Games and You.
5146557	5152461	I don't understand, but it wouldn't start up, so I reinstalled it like two times, and eventually I just called Blizzard.
5152861	5156583	They told me that my graphics card just happened to not be compatible with World of Warcraft.
5157144	5161306	He told me luckily I was able to play for a while, but once I installed the expansion pack, it stopped working.
5162046	5166469	I have a VS3G Unichrome Pro ITG graphics card.
5166909	5171032	Just to warn anyone who plays World of Warcraft or is starting, just make sure that... Excuse me.
5171477	5178083	You should upgrade to a new graphics card if you have the VIAS 3G Unichrome Pro IGT graphics card.
5180845	5181426	What, what, Loki?
5182987	5184688	He's got an in-the-groove graphics card.
5184849	5185549	Oh, IGT?
5186630	5187831	That shoots a hole in my joke.
5188512	5188832	P.S.
5188892	5192735	My cousin bought Burning Crusade for my birthday, and now I can't play World of Warcraft at all.
5192815	5193796	Nice birthday present, isn't it?
5194517	5195357	Aw, don't cry, emo kid.
5198379	5199500	Tough advice from Chris.
5200640	5205042	I installed it and it was a pain in the ass, but I've got a Mac, so I don't need to upgrade anything.
5205922	5206383	Next.
5207623	5208524	Wait, what number?
5209044	5209704	Shut up, Rosa.
5210405	5211685	This is from Let's Have Tea.
5211705	5213346	Wait, email what?
5213986	5214446	Number four.
5215167	5216187	Email number four.
5217988	5218468	Hey there.
5219769	5220309	I know, I don't know.
5220349	5221890	I think my semi went away because she sounded 17.
5222050	5223150	Fuck you.
5225371	5226732	Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.
5228453	5229394	Hey there, OLR.
5229434	5230234	Let's have tea here.
5231035	5235597	I have been a long-time listener, even though I have only actually tuned into the live show a few times, Podcast for the Win.
5236098	5237759	That's not what this email is about, though.
5237819	5241301	A few weeks back, you were talking about the Wii being used as a fitness weight loss tool.
5241661	5245864	I was digging through Dig, and came across a few interesting articles.
5245964	5250626	One article was showing how somebody lost nine pounds playing Wii Sports for 30 minutes a day for six weeks.
5250686	5252488	He didn't change his normal eating habits at all.
5252548	5253468	He just played the game more.
5254028	5254969	That's because it's exercise.
5256350	5257571	Also, it's...
5258658	5259918	Activity for 30 minutes.
5260058	5260759	It will raise the heart rate.
5261479	5265760	Dude, I burn weight doing massage three days a week for 30 minutes.
5266100	5267481	So, yeah.
5267521	5270121	You do any kind of exercise for 30 minutes a day.
5270201	5274302	And also, if you don't eat McDonald's during that same length of time, you'll lose twice as much.
5274863	5275463	Yeah, exactly.
5276823	5280184	Also, I saw another article about wrist weight with the Wii logo on them.
5280764	5286646	Sure, they were fan-created concept products, but there are similar products out there for similar workout activities.
5287185	5288566	I am not prescribing nor recommending anything.
5288586	5289426	This is not a prescription.
5289446	5290086	Just to protect my ass.
5313633	5322075	You do run a risk of damaging your wrists using a wrist weight with anything that you have to flick or move your wrist with.
5323156	5325697	Wrist weights are actually not all that safe to use.
5325817	5326337	Exactly.
5326417	5329558	No one wants to break their masturbating wrists.
5331338	5333559	My problem is I would not want... I have a point.
5333719	5334019	Okay.
5335579	5340961	If you want to put more effort into it, I say stand up and do it.
5342510	5348893	You burn more calories standing up.
5349934	5356997	My problem is that I would not want to wear the wrist weights because I would be afraid that my wrist would hang down more than it already does.
5357958	5359618	Then you'd look uber gay.
5359638	5361759	There's a visual there.
5364101	5365041	Radio visual joke.
5366682	5368323	Here, I got some advice.
5369063	5370784	Get up and go to the fucking gym!
5372626	5377629	I have no patience for people who sit there and say, you get a great workout playing the video game.
5377669	5378429	No, you don't.
5378669	5380010	Actually, yeah, you do if you play DDR.
5380690	5382191	That's not the same thing, though.
5382731	5383652	Oh, actually.
5384132	5386493	Okay, I can give you DDR.
5386593	5388094	I did get up and play.
5389074	5394677	It's a difference if you actually get up and move your arm as opposed to sitting on the couch and flicking your wrist.
5395317	5399299	If you get up and get into the game, you actually are elevating your heart rate.
5399379	5402221	You are actually burning more than you are sitting down and flicking your wrist.
5403231	5410123	Yeah, but you need to also stop eating junk food and you need to go outside in the sunshine and you need to check yourself into a gym so you don't turn fat.
5411365	5412607	I see it as like steps.
5413248	5414068	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5435996	5436316	DarkSakura.com
5459864	5463585	It's not, I mean, I completely agree with Chris, you know, it's good to get out of the house, etc.
5463625	5465585	No, I'm in complete agreement on that.
5465605	5466126	I agree with that, too.
5466346	5468046	But sometimes going to the gym sucks.
5468906	5476268	Let's face it, people go there to meet other people, people are checking each other out, and when I go in there in my fat ass, I am not interested in that.
5476308	5483430	I do want to get a workout, and if I can do it at home and not be bored out of my brain because the Stairmaster goes nowhere, I feel like a hamster wheel.
5483510	5485050	I feel like I'm on the hamster wheel of life.
5486012	5488613	You pay $50 and you go up!
5490054	5491074	Dennis Leary for the win.
5491394	5492074	Yes, Dennis Leary.
5492975	5494255	Life sucks, get a helmet!
5495355	5496036	Yay, I'm sorry.
5498016	5512761	Another thing, though, is, you know, and this is what I'm going to do, because I used to be an utter gym junkie before I developed chronic fatigue syndrome, because I was going to the gym five days a week, I dropped something like 85 pounds in two and a half years.
5512921	5513722	Which I hate you for.
5514882	5514982	Um...
5515467	5519789	Jamie used to have a few extra pounds, but she's lost it all.
5519829	5520249	She's hot.
5521049	5533934	I don't care saying I went from a size 22 to a size 12 in two and a half years.
5533974	5538076	Going to the gym was good for me because I actually like to lift weights because I like being stronger.
5538897	5540737	But cardio is fucking boring.
5541397	5550179	So I'm actually, now that I have the okay to go back to the gym, I'm actually going to be taking... Okay, I've been slightly obsessed with Dancing with the Stars lately, after watching Stacey Keebler's legs.
5551039	5552479	So I'm going to actually take ballroom dancing.
5552879	5553600	You know what they should have?
5553900	5554780	They should have Wii Yoga.
5555640	5557380	Wii Yoga would be amazing!
5557640	5563101	They kind of have something like that on Xbox, and I think there was a version on GameCube.
5563121	5564041	I know there was on PS2.
5564101	5565782	It was that Think Fitness game or whatever.
5566302	5567222	I think it had yoga in it.
5567422	5567562	Yeah.
5570749	5579316	I want the entirety of our listeners to know that when I say, yeah, you can fucking go to the gym, this is from experience, okay?
5580096	5581478	You can get off your ass and do it.
5581778	5582859	You just have to want it bad enough.
5583039	5586842	Nothing changes until you want it bad enough to make it change.
5587577	5588097	Thank you, Jamie.
5588117	5590958	But would it be fair to say there's also alternatives?
5591238	5595939	Because we have a lot of folks in chat saying gyms are expensive or folks don't like the gym environment.
5595959	5600020	Like JV Mon says, gyms in the village in NYC are just big bathhouses with exercise equipment.
5600340	5601520	It's called going outside and walking.
5601540	5602580	There's alternatives.
5603120	5605261	And maybe go outside, run.
5605321	5606241	Go outside, walk.
5606301	5607181	Find a walking buddy.
5607561	5609562	Do something to make yourself more fit.
5609742	5613122	But wouldn't this be at least a little baby step in the right direction?
5613523	5614623	Yeah, I granted that.
5614883	5615523	I granted that.
5615922	5617383	I just, people annoy me.
5618244	5621327	And for Ryoma, a special message for you, fuck your Yankee blue jeans.
5625490	5625951	Yay!
5626171	5628333	Anyway, there's more to that email.
5628453	5628813	Oh, more?
5628893	5630034	Okay, wow.
5630455	5630935	A little bit.
5631395	5632076	We were at the end.
5633371	5637933	Again, I love the show, and thank you so much for the many hours of entertainment and news you have provided everyone.
5638373	5646256	I'm a, quote, truck driver, pickup truck, haha, and have to drive a little over an hour straight every Saturday and Sunday, so your podcast really helps pass the time.
5646657	5647997	Thanks again, and best wishes.
5648637	5655780	And it also says, let's have tea rates as low as 4.65% refinance $150,000 loan for $579 a month.
5657121	5657621	Amazing.
5658541	5659562	And you want to know what's funny?
5660662	5662243	Since I work in the mortgage industry...
5663408	5668469	That actually isn't really all that great unless you have an interest-only loan.
5668649	5671330	Isn't that some ad that goes on the bottom of the email automatically?
5672430	5673351	I think it's hilarious.
5673531	5676872	I work in the mortgage industry, so whenever I see those things, I go, is that shitty?
5677772	5679292	Because I know how to read loan documents.
5680152	5681293	It actually is another language.
5681333	5682913	Too bad this isn't a banking show.
5683873	5686074	Yeah, but I have tomorrow off, so suck it!
5687566	5688386	No, you suck it.
5688626	5689587	I have to work tomorrow.
5690147	5691587	Suck it twice, huh?
5691747	5692828	Suck it infinity.
5693168	5694788	Oh, yeah?
5695388	5697289	Well, you can eat a hairy clam.
5699830	5702090	Did she tell me to eat a hairy clit on?
5702530	5705451	She said a hairy clam.
5706391	5707572	Polish my pearl, Rob.
5708712	5709672	Fucking gross.
5711293	5712913	This show just got rated AO.
5716408	5717328	I can't believe.
5718088	5721349	I think, I think, in like, what is this, episode 220?
5721469	5724890	In 220 episodes of Orange House Radio, that was the foulest thing that bitch has ever said to me.
5726930	5729570	I had the top Irene's crusty shit.
5729830	5730171	Oh, okay.
5730291	5730871	I know, Rob.
5731271	5732571	Remember, you are a douchebag.
5733691	5735712	Yes, Rob is the official douchebag.
5735812	5736832	Oh, God.
5737052	5742333	Why are you bringing up like five-year-old drama of a guy that drives me nuts?
5742613	5743833	There's this guy who drives me
5744594	5745815	Oh, it's like Neil's on a chalkboard.
5746155	5748476	No, no, no, I'm not going to say it, because I'm not going to give attention.
5749016	5749657	I will say it.
5750357	5755499	He works for a major gaming blog now, and I'm just like, oh, this guy's so annoying.
5756700	5763783	Yeah, he called me a douchebag once at a DDR tournament, and my response, I was like, because Irene was with me, I was like, oh my god, Irene, I'm vinegar and water.
5763903	5764664	Did you hear that?
5766785	5767325	You're clean.
5767965	5769446	Yes, at least I'm clean.
5769606	5770186	Cut your hair.
5770927	5771527	All right, anyway, I'll
5772489	5772869	That's it.
5773229	5775131	I don't want to get into drama, because I really don't care.
5776531	5777352	I'm at least years old.
5777772	5780133	I don't even know why this person didn't like me, to be honest.
5780974	5784776	Because he... I mean, I know why I don't like him, because he didn't like me.
5784896	5786137	It's like, you started it.
5786437	5791680	He has an electrocuted corncob, but yes, it has this, but just so tight, that any time they pull it out, it bleeds.
5792260	5792800	Alright, anyhow.
5793061	5794141	Can we please change the subject?
5794161	5794962	I don't want to talk about it.
5795182	5797423	I was just trying to talk about the years old drama.
5797763	5798984	Alright, uh...
5799955	5801136	Somebody, please, anybody.
5801476	5802357	Was that the end of the mailbag?
5802437	5803638	Yes, I told you.
5803798	5806480	Let's close the mailbag and get back into the news, please.
5806560	5808422	I blame Chris and Marissa for making me cry for the first time.
5808442	5809542	We are running so long this segment.
5809562	5809963	That's all right.
5809983	5812144	Oh, baby, any time.
5812345	5814066	Tiger Clawed is not Gaming Steve.
5814126	5815147	That's Scott's issue.
5816007	5817549	I don't even know Gaming Steve.
5817969	5828457	Anyways, so speaking of idiotic, there's a brand new channel added to the Wii this week called Everybody Votes, which is not true because not everybody does vote.
5829736	5839083	Should be locked out for... So, yeah, the Everybody Votes channel, and you get to vote on such wonderful topics like, what's better, dogs or cats?
5839944	5840624	Woohoo!
5841745	5842786	Yay, that's fun.
5842986	5858478	Worth my Wii to be flashing, by the way, and it's still flashing because I have not turned it on since this stupid channel came out, but apparently you can vote on these, you find out the results, and then it gets, you know,
5859184	5862926	Logged into your profile to how many you got right versus how many you got wrong.
5863006	5866188	And I guess you can show people your wee penis.
5866208	5870270	To be honest, I wish this channel was Everybody Poops because that would be a lot better.
5870290	5870970	That would be true.
5871750	5873051	But should that be a question?
5873471	5875932	Which do you prefer more in the bathroom, one or two?
5878174	5879674	Well, with two, you can read.
5879975	5882516	I mean, one, you're... Anyway, this is disgusting.
5883596	5885477	I actually think the channel is really cute.
5886378	5887158	I didn't have a problem with it.
5887178	5888799	I think it's... You know, it's not...
5890370	5894314	It's the perfect kind of... Nintendo did not make any fanfare out of it.
5894514	5897237	This is probably just something that used to be a tech demo.
5897738	5899440	I mean, we're going to be seeing a lot of crap like this.
5899700	5901843	But Nintendo did not try to sell this to anyone.
5901863	5904526	They did not try to put it out like, by the week, because we had the Everyone Votes channel.
5904546	5907769	No, it was just like, hey, we're just going to put this up because we're bored.
5908050	5910813	We're going to put up this Everyone Votes channel just because we have it, and here it is.
5911440	5912621	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5931135	5932175	I don't think it's a bad thing.
5932195	5932636	I think it's cute.
5960714	5962915	There aren't any kittens left because of all the masturbating.
5963235	5963575	That's why.
5965335	5965675	I see.
5965695	5968856	Alright, well there you go.
5969016	5970537	Did anybody else try the voting channel?
5971597	5973237	I watched Extra for Do It last night.
5973517	5976438	Was it cute though?
5976498	5977478	I thought the channel was cute.
5978078	5981139	I hate the entire world because cats are more awesome.
5982039	5986301	Actually, I believe it was Switzerland where cats outrank dogs.
5986741	5987661	So let's all move to Switzerland.
5987681	5987861	Norway.
5988496	5990117	We have a Norway listener in chat tonight.
5990197	5991797	I love our Norwegian listener.
5992377	5995519	So Olaf, we need to get Olaf the Viking a cat.
5997059	6000681	I want pictures of, never mind, that's a Doctor Who reference.
6000741	6001301	Anyhow, sorry.
6002141	6006523	All right, so go vote if you want on your Wii right now.
6006903	6010044	Another thing you can do on your Wii right now is download Kid Icarus.
6010484	6014786	But you should know that some of the codes that you may remember from your childhood, they don't work.
6015242	6020384	If you want to put in Icarus fights Medusa Angels, that code is not going to work.
6020665	6022465	There is a warning before you download it.
6022505	6025847	It says the original kit Icarus used allows players to use secret passwords.
6026147	6028048	However, Virtual Console does not support these passwords.
6028268	6031150	And at first I thought that meant passwords weren't going to work at all.
6031490	6032370	And that's not true.
6032730	6038373	You still can use the old, you know, little jumble 0080C whatever type passwords.
6039126	6046688	It's just the secret ones won't work because apparently the original cartridge had an included module in it to process the special codes.
6046828	6047808	I never realized that.
6048869	6052170	But don't the emulators emulate those codes?
6052810	6054650	So that seems so weird to me.
6054750	6062772	Like if you play this on Nesticle or whatever those NES emulators are you use, can't you use those codes?
6063653	6063973	Yeah.
6064253	6065133	So I don't get it.
6067482	6069163	Uh, because they're lazy?
6069243	6070664	Well, I don't know enough about hardware, I guess.
6070704	6076066	Because they're too busy working on everybody votes to, I don't know, fix their virtual console stuff?
6076126	6082209	I don't think, everybody votes was already done in some capacity, I think, as some type of, like, demonstration.
6082650	6083670	I'm not, it's not that.
6083790	6087952	I'm talking about, you know, um, this, this thing here.
6088312	6093455	But, but really, maybe it was just done so that people would have to see how fucking hard Kid Icarus really was.
6094312	6097775	I think a lot of y'all forgot, because you used to use those passwords to just beat the game.
6098255	6099797	But Kid Icarus is fucking hard.
6100137	6101158	It is, but it's awesome.
6101598	6101838	It is.
6101978	6102899	It's definitely worth your time.
6103540	6104100	I love that game.
6104120	6106042	It's worth five bucks.
6106122	6107703	You'll never get a sequel!
6108063	6108604	Never!
6109745	6110765	Fuck you, I hate you.
6112647	6117291	Well, speaking of the Virtual Console, we do actually have some other news.
6117331	6123175	There's a few of the Japan-only games that are going to be coming onto the US Virtual Console.
6123215	6123836	It's pretty cool.
6124868	6141134	Um, it's actually, um, with a conversation with Nintendo of America, uh, Senior VP George Harrison, they, um, are looking into bringing some of the more successful Japanese franchises that have that cult following in the U.S., um, on the Virtual Console.
6141234	6144555	Basically, those of us who are the niche gamers, they love us.
6144935	6146256	Nintendo loves us!
6147056	6147576	That's proof.
6148276	6152738	So they're talking about, um, bringing over some of the games if they can have them translated properly.
6153581	6156524	I'm sorry, but if they really loved us, they would have made the fucking thing region-free.
6157245	6157465	True.
6158366	6161249	However, they still haven't given me Guardian Legend!
6162010	6162430	Bastards.
6163752	6167155	Guardian Legend is that game we will always bitch about that we will never get on Virtual Console.
6167736	6172000	Guardian Legend is the... Actually... Greatest 8-bit game ever made, that's all that needs to be said.
6172521	6175224	And then it's followed by the greatest 16-bit game ever made.
6176457	6177137	Run to a blood!
6178278	6183581	Now, I think about, wasn't the MSX announced as one of the systems they were going to emulate in Japan on Virtual Console?
6183601	6188424	I do believe so, because if we get an MSX emulator on here, do you know what that means we get?
6188544	6189625	Metal fucking gear.
6189805	6190145	Uh-uh.
6190565	6192166	The real sequel to Metal Gear 2.
6192206	6192346	Dude.
6194033	6195874	That's it right there.
6195974	6196734	That's what I want.
6196954	6199355	You write that right under Guardian Legend on the wish list.
6199875	6202016	On MSX, there were two Guardian Legend games.
6202316	6207318	That'd be on the same list of, yeah, sure, we'll implement online before we implement this shit.
6208619	6209659	Fuck you, I hate you.
6209759	6212160	But on the MSX, there actually were two Guardian Legend games.
6212220	6213080	It's called Guardia.
6214541	6215341	I've heard of Guardia.
6215381	6216962	I've never played it, but that would be hot.
6218709	6225352	I had a photograph of it once that my MSX emulator wouldn't run, so I was so upset.
6228573	6239697	And I'm sure that everyone's going to be... Well, I don't know if anyone's really going to be interested in this, but apparently they're putting out Brunswick Pro Bowling for Nintendo Wii, the PlayStation 2, and PSP.
6241358	6242799	Honestly, ask yourself.
6244159	6246020	When ever...
6247191	6253172	Ever, other than Wii Bowling, has there ever been a good bowling game on any console?
6253212	6254173	You just said it.
6254373	6255173	Wii Bowling.
6255433	6256473	Other than Wii Bowling.
6256533	6258134	The Tekken bowling game on Tekken.
6258654	6259754	Oh, shush.
6260574	6261354	It was fun.
6262054	6263015	For three seconds.
6264095	6268756	Can I be really lame and not console-oriented and say that Elf Bowling was awesome?
6270054	6271735	Wee!
6271915	6275618	How about... What's the one they had at the Metreon years ago?
6275718	6277379	Mega Bowling or whatever that thing was for you.
6277519	6278500	Mega Touch Bowling.
6278520	6279961	No, that wasn't at Metreon.
6279981	6282022	That was at... Dave & Buster's has it too.
6282042	6283703	Dave & Buster's with the giant screen.
6283943	6284804	They had it at the Metreon too.
6284864	6285404	I remember this.
6285745	6286525	Because we played it there.
6286565	6288306	And Neo Geo Bowling, Ryoma says.
6288647	6288887	Anyway.
6289527	6290348	And Clubhouse Games.
6290508	6290588	But...
6290899	6295300	Because everybody loves Wii Bowling, somebody said, let's turn this into an actual full-fledged game.
6295520	6296300	Yeah, that's great.
6296320	6298601	Let's charge something that you can get, I don't know, for free.
6298621	6299821	There's a pinball game called Nine Pin.
6301481	6305782	Let's just make another game that's exactly the same as the last one and charge you money for it.
6305802	6308242	But that's okay because it runs with Pro Bowling.
6308282	6311483	And I'm sure, to be honest, when it does come out, it'll be like $20.
6312623	6315484	So who gives a shit?
6315524	6316564	I mean, it's going to be cheap.
6317204	6319905	I mean, God crave.
6320365	6320605	I mean...
6322210	6322530	I don't know.
6322850	6323531	The last, what was it?
6323551	6330595	The last, they had like some, I want to say, Extreme Bowling 2006 that came out last year.
6331256	6333117	It was uber lame, by the way.
6333597	6346786	So, hopefully, they will go with, you know, the same kind of gameplay as Wii Bowling, but somehow I think they're going to fuck it up because they always fuck it up.
6346826	6347606	Comments from chat.
6347646	6349788	James Patrick says, Elf Bowling, shooter.
6350468	6350888	TJ and I...
6352543	6354905	DJ Janai says, Elf Bowling is more fun if you're drunk.
6356327	6358009	DJ Dark Knight says, Simpsons Bowling.
6358769	6361612	Alpha Canogram agrees, Tekken Bowling.
6361712	6364855	Gaming Nerd says, let's throw our Wiimotes directly into our TVs and break them.
6364915	6366457	Oops, I thought I was holding a bowling ball.
6368119	6371482	Actdeft says, what I do want is a new baseball game for the Wii.
6371822	6373424	And Tiger Claw remembers.
6373772	6375593	Guys, what about Hyper Bowling?
6375754	6377715	It came with Microsoft Plus for the XP.
6378075	6378496	That's what it was.
6378516	6379477	It was called Hyper Bowling.
6379517	6380617	But you actually had a bowling ball.
6380738	6383019	Because that was the version of it that they had in the arcades.
6383039	6384981	It was Hyper Bowling, but with like an actual ball that you roll.
6385001	6385641	Anyway, forget it.
6388404	6390585	I was excited that Tigerclaw reminded me of the name of that.
6392947	6394328	Is that it or any more stories?
6394408	6394648	Oh, no.
6394668	6395349	Next story is mine.
6395369	6396050	Whoops, my bad.
6397190	6397891	Haha, fail.
6398632	6401174	And it has to do with one of my very favorite countries.
6401194	6402835	The only other country I've really been to.
6403314	6403814	I can't remember.
6403854	6405795	I went to the Caribbean when I was seven, but that doesn't count.
6406095	6407856	It's the only other country I've really been to is Canada.
6408356	6416260	And Canada, you know, even though we have a lot of Canadian listeners, things are kind of quiet gaming-wise in Canada.
6416300	6423683	I mean, sure, you've got some of the game studios in Toronto, Vancouver, but for the most part, you don't hear a whole lot of big gaming news coming out of Canada.
6423703	6424444	Well, now, guess what?
6424564	6431507	ESA has their sights set on Canada because apparently Canada has pirates galore.
6434191	6435251	Yay, pirates!
6457737	6464578	And they're saying that Canada has failed to deliver on promises of more stringent copyright laws and stepped up enforcements for laws already on the books.
6464938	6475020	Quote, Canada remains far behind virtually all of its peers in the industrialized world with respect to its efforts to bring its copyright laws up to date with realities of the global digital networked environment.
6475520	6480581	Indeed, even the major developing countries have progressed further and faster than Canada in meeting the challenge.
6481261	6484762	Insert mandatory playing Canada joke here.
6485022	6485102	Ace.
6486471	6490613	I have to say from personal experience, all my Canadian friends love Warcraft, but then again, who doesn't?
6490773	6491234	And pot.
6491674	6493795	And preferably at the same time.
6494455	6496437	Which really confused me.
6497717	6499618	So what does a Canadian pirate look like?
6502340	6502920	I don't know.
6504641	6506342	Jack Sparrow that kind of smells like maple?
6506482	6507042	I don't know.
6507923	6511665	I have this image of a bobsled that looks like a ship with a sail on it and dogs.
6513326	6514126	Arr, mush.
6514867	6514947	No.
6514987	6515107	No.
6515973	6517393	I'm going to Canada later this year.
6518654	6519114	That's good.
6519234	6519994	Canada's a fun place.
6520014	6521534	And I'm going to find me a Canadian pirate.
6524015	6525596	Maybe he'll find your booty?
6527156	6528516	Rob.
6528616	6532117	What the fuck is a ferret?
6534358	6535338	It's a bad joke.
6535358	6536258	Look, I'll hit myself with Kirby.
6536278	6536418	Isn't
6539130	6539750	DNL's Kirby?
6539790	6540711	It's DNL's Kirby.
6540731	6541512	She needs to come get it.
6541532	6543133	DNL, you need to come get your Kirby.
6543393	6548696	Because I'm getting my coobies all over this Kirby that DMN brought on my nipple.
6548716	6549017	Look at that.
6549057	6549377	Look at that.
6549397	6549797	There you go.
6550858	6552179	Just for you, Renee.
6552399	6553500	He's sexing it up for you.
6554240	6557022	Well, I have news that's better than blaming Canada for shit.
6557502	6557802	What's that?
6558083	6559884	Well, actually, it's not really all that exciting.
6560244	6567789	But DirecTV has something called Game Lounge now, and it's this interactive channel for family stuff that you play through your satellite box.
6567869	6568750	So it's like,
6569464	6570745	Xbox Live Suck Edition.
6571466	6575229	It has games that are based on kids shows like Spongebob.
6576550	6581454	And it has competitive games where you can compete for prizes and money.
6582655	6587279	And you should check it out, I guess, if you are into family games.
6588380	6590242	I like for my games to have blood and sex.
6590282	6591263	Gaming Lounge?
6591723	6592884	It's called Game Lounge.
6592904	6593344	Game Lounge.
6593384	6594405	Was Orange Lounge taken?
6595666	6596407	Oh, I guess it was.
6597028	6597848	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6628413	6630114	Hey guys, I have this really great idea.
6630394	6630814	No.
6632134	6632614	That was it.
6632674	6633555	That was it right there.
6634015	6635095	That was the recreation.
6638516	6639596	Shot down again by Jamie.
6641397	6641637	Rob.
6642137	6642337	What?
6642577	6642877	Heart!
6644338	6644618	Alright.
6647339	6648959	Anyhow.
6649499	6651240	We've gone very long this segment.
6651280	6651980	Almost two hours.
6652600	6654541	Marissa, can you believe this show is only half over?
6657600	6659841	If this is torture, then chain me to the wall.
6660902	6662743	But the listeners like it when it's long.
6663464	6665965	You guys like it long, don't you?
6666706	6667706	You like it long.
6668127	6668407	All right.
6668707	6674911	Well, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio with Part B of our show.
6675992	6680975	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
6681435	6685738	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
