0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	12000	These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco
12000	20000	Tonight, February 18th, 2007, new arcade games are revealed, including Tekken 6 and Silent Hill.
20000	27000	Someone in the know violates Microsoft's partner, NetNDA, and could rare be developing something for a Nintendo platform?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	40000	We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about,
40000	44000	and a little bit of gaming culture, geek culture, pop culture types of fare.
44000	47000	I'm here to help you through the next few hours of Orange Lounge Radio.
47000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.
51000	52000	Ah!
52000	55000	Whoa, the angsty, loud Dark Sakura. How are you?
55000	58000	Um, I hate people.
58000	60000	I'm sorry to hear it. Why do you hate people?
60000	63000	Because they drive slowly.
63000	64000	What are you talking about?
64000	65000	And cut me off in traffic.
65000	68000	It's always traffic with you, girl. What is it this time?
68000	75000	No, no, I also hate Starbucks for their extra hot tea that we got for you that scalded me.
75000	80000	I need tea. If you can't tell, my voice is a little bit off tonight again,
80000	83000	because I was screaming at Rocky last night, and you know, now I'm paying for today.
83000	88000	I'm still on the tin can mic. Although, I listened to last week's playback,
88000	91000	and what I noticed is that I was very loud, so I apologize for that,
91000	93000	so I've adjusted the audio for this week.
93000	94000	That's okay, we're used to it.
94000	97000	But on the playback, because it's a lowered bit rate on the podcast,
97000	99000	it didn't sound as bad. It didn't sound as tin can.
99000	100000	As usual?
100000	101000	So I don't think it'll be so bad.
101000	104000	The show sucked, but I was good.
104000	105000	Really?
105000	106000	I'm just kidding.
108000	109000	I'm just kidding.
109000	110000	That's surprising.
110000	113000	No. What? What the?
113000	116000	I'm doing it the whole time, and you're like, lalalalala.
116000	118000	Have you been like snorting crack today?
118000	120000	No, I had a frappuccino.
120000	121000	Oh, goodie.
121000	124000	Here we go, it's another one of those shows.
124000	125000	A crappuccino?
125000	127000	Say hello as well to Loki.
127000	130000	I forgot that I turned the mic off, so I didn't catch that last comment.
130000	132000	That's why I didn't call you a tech mouse to Loki tonight,
132000	134000	because apparently you forgot how to work sound equipment. Good job.
134000	135000	The winner is you.
135000	136000	Hey.
136000	137000	We hope you have enjoyed.
137000	139000	I know how to use sound equipment.
139000	140000	Do you?
140000	141000	Yes.
141000	142000	All right.
142000	144000	Well, we have some special guests with us in the studio tonight.
144000	146000	They're extra special. They have their own bus.
146000	149000	It's going to be another very interesting week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
149000	154000	The feedback from last week is that you guys liked a little bit of the silliness we had going on last week,
154000	158000	so we brought some of the silliest people we know to the program.
158000	160000	Say hello to one of the Orange Lounge Radio...
160000	162000	Oh, god damn it.
164000	166000	Oh, I get the mailbag.
166000	168000	No. No mailbag for you. Sorry.
168000	171000	Apparently none of us remember how to use sound tonight.
171000	175000	Say hello to one of the Orange Lounge Radio lesbians. Chris.
175000	177000	Hi, kids.
177000	178000	How are you doing, Chris?
178000	185000	Well, I just had Starbucks, so I'm a little bit more awake, so I'm okay.
185000	186000	It's been a long weekend.
186000	188000	Propagino. Propagino.
188000	193000	Say hello to one of the Orange Lounge Radio gays, Casper the Gay.
193000	195000	I'm yummy.
195000	197000	Are you trying to imitate my voice in the opening?
197000	199000	No.
199000	202000	And also say hello to somebody brand new.
202000	205000	She's losing her Orange Lounge cherry tonight.
205000	207000	She's brand new to the program.
212000	214000	It's Marissa.
214000	216000	Hello.
216000	217000	How are you, Marissa?
217000	219000	I love it when you talk nerdy to me.
219000	221000	All right.
221000	224000	Marissa is the originator of Uta's brassieres.
224000	231000	I would like to point out, whatever brassiere Marissa has on tonight, you know, I might be gay, but I can't help but look.
231000	236000	Marissa, you have to do it for the listeners so that they hear the original Uta's brassieres.
236000	237000	Should I do it right now or later?
237000	239000	Sure. Why not? Why not?
239000	247000	Well, the Uta's brassiere thing originated because I am a A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-A-B-H-H-H-H.
247000	249000	No.
249000	253000	For all you nerds out there, I am wearing a...
253000	256000	I'm a geek too. I'm just a music geek.
256000	259000	I am a double G.
259000	262000	So my sisters were complaining about the types of bras that they get to wear.
262000	268000	And I thought this was the most ridiculous thing ever because it is awkward changing in the locker room.
268000	273000	But they have all these choices, you know, spangly this and clear straps this and that and, you know,
273000	276000	zebra bras and all they get to wear are Uta's brassieres.
276000	279000	You know, Nazi bras from the Third Reich.
279000	283000	You won't wear them and you will like them.
283000	286000	In old country, teeth did not fly free.
286000	292000	They were disciplined and they stood at attention like rockets.
292000	297000	So that's where it came from.
297000	300000	Of course, we have our chat room.
300000	302000	We would never have a show complete without our chat room.
302000	304000	Is the chat room going insane?
304000	309000	Well, the minute Marissa says double G.
309000	311000	Alpha Catagram says double G.
311000	314000	Shadow's Liar says this is the best show ever.
314000	317000	Fire Bulma says keep this girl.
317000	321000	Now, because the show is about video games, we need to kind of confess.
321000	323000	Marissa, you're not a hardcore gamer, are you?
323000	328000	No, because I've been depressed ever since they stopped making King's Quest.
328000	331000	Okay, but so you used to play like the old school adventure games, right?
331000	335000	Oh, I was obsessed with it, yeah. I was obsessed with all of them.
335000	337000	Have you heard about the King's Quest fan project?
337000	340000	The Silver Lining? We host the demo on orangeonshooter.com.
340000	344000	I hadn't heard of the brand new one, although I downloaded, I guess,
344000	349000	Sierra as opposed to Sierra and made remakes of the really, really old school ones.
349000	350000	I think I downloaded those.
350000	352000	I remember hearing about that. Cool.
352000	354000	Did you play Space Quest and some of the other stuff too?
354000	358000	Space Quest, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is my personal favorite.
358000	361000	I love that one. Sam & Max Full Throttle.
361000	367000	God, you know, I had scum VM on my computer, so I just relived all of my memories on that.
367000	371000	But I didn't get into Siberia, which I was told I was supposed to like Siberia
371000	374000	because it was the new adventure game, but it did get a little boring.
374000	378000	Sometimes it's tough to live up to the classics, you know, when people say,
378000	380000	oh, there's this new game out and it's like the classic.
380000	382000	But then you play it and it's really not, you know.
382000	385000	It's true, but I think a lot of the appeal of the adventure games was the humor,
385000	387000	and Siberia kind of lacked that.
387000	389000	I've been eaten by a grue.
389000	392000	I've got to say, Jared J. in chat says, she loves King's Quest?
392000	394000	Oh, my God, marry me.
394000	396000	Marissa's taken, yes?
396000	398000	Oh, yes, but for a little self-whoring,
398000	404000	MySpace.com slash Marissa Meisel, M-A-R-I-S-S-A M-E-I-Z-E-L.
404000	407000	It's like Marissa Meisel. I'm a musician.
407000	410000	I was going to say, you know, of course, when guests come on real radio,
410000	413000	they pimp out their stuff, so you're actually a legit musician.
413000	416000	What kind of music do you do?
416000	418000	Folk rock without it being too whiny.
418000	421000	Folk rock. That's a genre. That's pretty awesome.
421000	423000	Acoustic guitar, yes.
423000	426000	Is that like Enya hardcore?
426000	432000	Who can say where the dub goes, where the duh-duh, only time.
432000	436000	It's like Peter, Paul, and Mary with electric guitar.
436000	440000	Puff the Magic Dragon, fuck you.
440000	442000	That whole thing? That's cool.
442000	446000	All right, I was going to say, as a legitimate musician,
446000	449000	what do you think about Guitar Hero?
449000	451000	Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
451000	453000	Is this a good ho-ho-ho or a bad ho-ho-ho?
453000	457000	Okay, what? Really quickly so we can get to the crux of the show here.
457000	459000	What do you think of Guitar Hero? Good thing, bad thing?
459000	462000	I've already sworn on the show. Am I allowed to again?
462000	466000	It's on the Internet. Fuck, shit, cock, cunt, piss, whore, whatever you want.
466000	469000	I fucking hate Guitar Hero!
469000	471000	Why do you hate Guitar Hero?
471000	478000	Well, I guess it's fun, but learning to play guitar gets you laid.
478000	483000	Playing video game guitar, it's not.
483000	488000	Well, no, it's only good fun, and I like that it brings attention to classic music,
488000	492000	but the most interesting part is that musicians suck at Guitar Hero,
492000	494000	just like real dancers suck at DDR.
494000	496000	It's true. They have videos of guys on the Internet
496000	499000	playing their own songs on Guitar Heroes, and they fucking suck at them.
499000	501000	Like, it's sad.
501000	503000	It's really, really funny.
503000	508000	Meg Z, when she has a Guitar Hero demo set up at her GameStop,
508000	510000	and they sit there and they ask her,
510000	512000	so does this teach you how to play a real guitar?
512000	514000	She goes, no, it doesn't.
514000	517000	No, but that's what it advertises. No, it doesn't.
517000	521000	And she has to get through to people to tell them it does not teach you how to play guitar.
521000	524000	I would like to say Jared Jay has changed his mind on Marissa.
524000	527000	Oh, shit, now I hate you. Go fuck a goat.
527000	529000	Go fuck a goat.
529000	531000	Aw.
531000	534000	But classic rock is good, huh?
534000	537000	You'll learn to embrace when the listeners tell you to go fuck things.
537000	542000	I like go fuck a cactus. That's my favorite.
542000	544000	Does that give me any points?
544000	546000	Rice Princess is going to make a cameo real quick.
546000	548000	Hi, Irene.
548000	549000	Oh, Marissa, Rice Princess.
549000	551000	Sorry, I'm introducing myself. Hi, Chris.
551000	552000	Rice Princess, Irene.
552000	554000	Okay, what's up, Rice Princess? How you doing?
554000	555000	I'm okay. I'm sick.
555000	557000	You brought a posse with you. What is this?
557000	558000	I brought my posse.
558000	559000	Introduce your posse real quick.
559000	560000	Okay, this is Chance.
560000	561000	Hey, what's up?
561000	563000	Real quickly, because we're not going to have time to have everybody on the show.
563000	565000	Chance, what type of games do you like?
565000	569000	PS2 games, like RPG games and action games.
569000	570000	Wow.
570000	571000	Wow and World of Warcraft?
571000	572000	Wow, yeah.
572000	575000	How about board games like Cold Set? Ever play that?
575000	578000	No, I play Axis and Allies and Risk.
578000	582000	Oh, you're like an old school gamer.
582000	583000	Yeah.
583000	587000	Okay, you like to do it the slow way. All right, who else is here?
587000	588000	My brother, Chris.
588000	590000	Hi, brother Chris.
590000	591000	What's up?
591000	594000	What type of games are you into, brother Chris?
594000	596000	I don't play video games. They're the devil.
596000	597000	He doesn't play video games.
597000	598000	He plays WoW.
598000	600000	We're not picking him up on the mic either, but he says he doesn't play video games.
600000	603000	I'm Chris and I am a butt.
603000	604000	All right, video games suck.
604000	605000	And this is Heather.
605000	606000	Hi, Heather.
606000	607000	Hi, Heather. Come up real quick.
607000	608000	You can't be shy.
608000	609000	How are you, Heather?
609000	610000	Great. How are you?
610000	611000	Good. Do you play video games?
611000	613000	Kind of. I'm a button masher. Sorry to say.
613000	616000	Button masher? What type of games do you play? Get the mic a little closer to your mouth.
616000	619000	Halo, Soul Calibur, Burnout.
619000	621000	Are you any good at Gears of War?
621000	622000	Never played it.
622000	627000	We're looking for some good players for Gears of War for something I can't talk about yet,
627000	632000	but we need to put together a team for Gears of War, and I'm very scared.
632000	633000	Interesting.
633000	635000	Pick that one up and check it out.
635000	636000	Okay.
636000	638000	Okay? And let me know how it goes. All right.
638000	643000	So what is this now, Rice Princess? Is this, like, one of those, like, swelled ego things after the last show?
643000	647000	You, you know, you got, like, a fan letter, and now you have this swelled ego.
647000	648000	Hey, you know what? I got two.
648000	650000	And she has to have an entourage everywhere she goes.
650000	652000	Okay, no, no. I got two fan letters now.
652000	654000	Yeah, I'm taking over your show now. Sorry, Rob.
654000	655000	No.
655000	657000	Now, did you know that I'm moving in again?
657000	660000	This will be the last week of Orange Lounge Radio.
660000	663000	Hope you enjoyed the program while it lasted.
663000	664000	Shut up.
664000	665000	All right.
665000	666000	All right, anyway.
666000	667000	Okay, I'm going to let you get back.
667000	668000	This is from show one.
668000	670000	Irene, you were here for show one, weren't you?
670000	671000	I totally was.
671000	672000	That was three studios ago.
672000	673000	Yeah, seriously, I remember.
673000	676000	All right, well, just like old times, you should go clean my kitchen.
676000	679000	Just like old times, I should punch you in your gong.
679000	680000	All right.
680000	682000	All right, anyway, we got to keep the show moving.
682000	683000	We got to get back to games.
683000	684000	Here you go.
684000	686000	Let's start. How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
686000	690000	For my gaming, I did massage.
690000	696000	Actually, no, we, Dan repaired our whodunnit, so I actually played some pinball.
696000	703000	And I played, I brought my PS2 over here, and we never played it.
703000	705000	I heard you brought it over here for Silent Hill,
705000	708000	but the meek latov was like, no, my panties are bunched too tight.
708000	709000	I can't play Silent Hill tonight.
709000	711000	Well, I also brought Crazy Taxi, and we didn't play it.
711000	712000	Crazy money.
712000	713000	For PS2?
713000	714000	Yeah.
714000	715000	You can only play that on Dreamcast.
715000	716000	I'm sorry.
716000	718000	I just grabbed a handful of stuff.
718000	720000	All right.
720000	722000	Interesting.
722000	723000	That's it?
723000	724000	Really?
724000	725000	Nothing else?
725000	726000	That's all right.
726000	727000	That's all right.
727000	728000	You're a busy girl.
728000	729000	Can't play games all the time.
729000	731000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
731000	732000	My gaming week was fun.
732000	738000	I played all, basically I just played only Crackdown, the full Crackdown.
738000	740000	Yeah, you got the retail release, right?
740000	741000	Yeah.
741000	742000	Yeah, so you're one of those bastards that got it early.
742000	744000	Because street dates don't apply to me.
744000	747000	Okay, well, sorry.
747000	753000	So yeah, I'm about two-thirds way through the game already, and it's worth it.
753000	758000	I really cannot wait until everyone else gets it so I can play some co-op.
758000	764000	It's actually pretty funny, because if you watch some of the AI, especially the AI drivers,
764000	765000	they're horrible.
765000	771000	In fact, I was trying to kill this one guy, and I heard all this crashing going on below
771000	775000	me, and there was a freeway below me, so I got on the edge and looked down, and there
775000	779000	was this giant pileup of cars, and you can actually see cars being ejected out of the
779000	783000	tunnel and just getting thrown into the ocean, and it was hilarious, and I had nothing to
783000	784000	do with it.
784000	789000	It was just the crabby AI drivers just crashed into each other and just launched cars into
789000	791000	the air.
791000	794000	Some Crackdown comments from our chatroom at chat.orangehonestradio.com.
794000	802000	Let's see, olarmyblaze says, okay, well, whoop-de-fucking-doo, Mr. I work in distribution.
802000	803000	But jeremytel1 has a serious question.
803000	806000	Loki, is the game too easy like I think it will be?
806000	810000	Like, are all the bosses really easy to kill once you start leveling up?
810000	816000	It gets harder as you go on, because the first, the Los Maritos bosses are pretty easy, but
816000	819000	then when you get to the second, the Volk are a lot harder.
819000	822000	They're not necessarily harder to kill, but it's more elaborate to get to them.
822000	827000	You can't just climb a building and boom, there they are.
827000	831000	And then everybody starts carrying rocket launchers, and it just gets a little complicated.
831000	834000	So, it does get harder as you go on.
834000	837000	It's just, also, I mean, there are three different difficulties, so if you're playing now the
837000	842000	standard one, it is going to be pretty easy going through the whole game, but, you know,
842000	845000	if you want more of a challenge, play on a harder difficulty.
845000	849000	But I think you'll be, at least, you know, play through the whole game, and then, you
849000	853000	know, if you want to go back and play it harder, definitely play the more challenging difficulties.
853000	858000	I think, as it is, it gets kind of hard, especially when you get towards the last gang, the Asian
858000	865000	gang, it's just, they're crazy, the amount of people that they throw at you, so, I don't
865000	867000	know, it does get harder, though.
867000	868000	Alright.
868000	870000	Anything else at your gaming week besides Crackdown?
870000	873000	Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories still.
873000	875000	Still, after all this time.
875000	877000	Oh yeah, we'll be playing until the next game comes out.
877000	878000	Alright.
878000	883000	One other question here, Jay Dorian asks, low-key, how does the full game's world compare
883000	884000	to the demo?
884000	885000	How much bigger does it feel?
885000	890000	Well, the demo, it was just pretty much half of the first island, it's not even the whole
890000	896000	first island, and the game feels huge, I mean, like, you get, I can't recognize certain areas
896000	901000	of the game, I mean, you can get lost pretty easy in it, so it does feel very large, it's,
901000	906000	there's a ton of places to explore, I've been practically everywhere in these last, the
906000	912000	first two islands or whatever, and I've only found about less than a third of the secret
912000	922000	orbs, and just over half of the agility orbs, and I'm already, I've already maxed out my
922000	931000	strength, and I'm about to max out my explosives, so it's, I mean, it, there's just a ton of
931000	933000	stuff to explore.
933000	937000	I did like the achievement, there's one achievement for killing people with this globe, it's a
937000	939000	giant globe that you find at the observatory.
939000	940000	Is it like the Lochmar?
940000	941000	No.
941000	947000	It's like a giant, like, metal globe, and you have to kill 15 people with it, and that
947000	948000	was fun.
948000	949000	Do you bowl them over or something?
949000	951000	Something like that, you basically kind of toss it onto them.
951000	952000	Throw it at their head.
952000	953000	Yeah, throw it at their head.
953000	954000	Interesting.
954000	957000	I kill people all the time by throwing things at their head.
957000	963000	It's just, the fun part's gonna be coming to, I think, the co-op gameplay, because you
963000	967000	can just run around and do whatever the fuck you want in that game, that's gonna be fun,
967000	971000	and what's kind of neat about it, and you don't really notice this in the demo, the
971000	975000	full game, you can actually have people jump in and out of your game while you're playing,
975000	976000	so.
976000	980000	I heard about that, that sounds pretty intuitive, but is that as good as it sounds, you think?
980000	983000	Yeah, it's just gonna be people jumping in and out, and you don't necessarily have to
983000	987000	play with them, they'll just, you know, they can go fuck around in your city or whatever,
987000	992000	so that's gonna be kind of cool, and then, I think, I remember hearing a long time ago
992000	997000	that one of the downloads that they were gonna have for Crackdown was a replay editor or
997000	1000000	something like that, where you can record your own gameplay, so that might be pretty
1000000	1002000	fun to share that with people.
1002000	1004000	Anything else?
1004000	1005000	That's it.
1005000	1008000	Alright, real quickly, I haven't done a lot this week.
1008000	1013000	I finally have taken a WoW character, World of Warcraft, further than I ever have before.
1013000	1019000	My character finally hit level 30, so I got, thank you, thank you.
1019000	1023000	I got Cheetah Form finally, and I'm halfway to 60, but now that means nothing, because
1023000	1025000	70 is the new cap, so.
1025000	1029000	But, as I swore to myself before, if I make it all the way to 40, I will finally buy Burning
1029000	1033000	Crusade, because that means I must actually be into Warcraft enough.
1033000	1038000	I don't have Burning Crusade yet, because I don't see the point of getting it, if I'm
1038000	1039000	not gonna.
1039000	1040000	Blood elves!
1040000	1044000	Blood elves are awesome, but seriously, on my server, everyone is playing Blood elves.
1044000	1045000	Everyone.
1045000	1047000	Yeah, I'll talk about that later.
1047000	1050000	Alright, and then I also played Paperboy, which is awesome.
1050000	1056000	On the Xbox 360, the old game, it translates pretty well to the Xbox 360, I gotta say,
1056000	1060000	because the game itself was kinda widescreen, like a little bit, like if you remember the
1060000	1063000	old cabinet it was in, it was kinda widescreen, so they didn't have to smush it or anything,
1063000	1065000	and the vertical bars aren't quite as big.
1065000	1069000	The achievements are kinda smart, they're not like really super duper easy, but not
1069000	1073000	super duper hard either, like the previous games, but I think Paperboy itself was a much
1073000	1074000	harder game than I remember.
1074000	1079000	Paperboy is one of those few truly original games, so definitely I recommend you guys
1079000	1083000	check out the demo if you're 360 owners, because if you never played Paperboy, at least play
1083000	1089000	the first level that the demo gives you, I think you'll find it's creative enough and
1089000	1092000	original enough of a game to necessitate buying the full game.
1092000	1097000	And they have co-op modes, and I think there's a competitive mode, I can't remember, because
1097000	1102000	I haven't taken it online yet, because most of my week's been on Warcraft, unfortunately.
1102000	1106000	I tried to get more achievements in Fusion Frenzy 2, but honestly, I couldn't tolerate
1106000	1108000	the game long enough to do it.
1108000	1112000	Like I got so fed up, I was like, oh my god, this game sucks, I turned it off.
1112000	1113000	I was like, it's not worth it.
1113000	1117000	I don't care what achievement point challenges are going on right now, I will earn them somewhere
1117000	1118000	else.
1118000	1119000	I can't do it.
1119000	1121000	Fusion Frenzy 2 is just that bad.
1121000	1124000	Chris, how was your gaming week?
1124000	1127000	I have become a World of Warcraft nerd.
1127000	1128000	Congratulations!
1128000	1131000	Yeah, clap for me, I need it.
1131000	1139000	Yeah, I just, I'm on only two of the servers, one is the noob one, which is where everyone
1139000	1140000	starts out.
1140000	1141000	Hydraxis, I think?
1141000	1142000	I don't know, I can't pronounce names.
1142000	1146000	And I've got like ten characters on there that haven't even reached level 15.
1146000	1148000	That's alright, you've got to start somewhere.
1148000	1152000	Yeah, and then I've got, but I have Burning Crusades, because if I'm going to get it,
1152000	1153000	I'm going to get all of it.
1153000	1157000	And it's really funny, on both the elves, because you know, when you start off a new
1157000	1161000	character, they all start with that little cinema, and they all say it with the elves,
1161000	1166000	it's like, it's like the elves, like, the last of their races, everybody is a fucking
1166000	1167000	elf!
1167000	1171000	Everyone is a blood elf, everyone is a night elf, they're all over, like, they're all
1171000	1175000	over the frickin' place, it's like, last of my, last of the race, my ass.
1175000	1179000	But the Draenei, oh my god, I don't care what anyone says, those things are hot.
1179000	1180000	I love the Draenei.
1180000	1181000	The Draenei girls are pretty hot.
1181000	1184000	Ugh, their Russian accents make me horny.
1184000	1187000	Please don't hold back.
1187000	1193000	I love those things so much, I think they were supposed to be something else, but I
1193000	1195000	like them being aliens, it's amusing.
1195000	1199000	Every time I hear the Draenei females speak, though, I can't help but think, Boris, look,
1199000	1200000	it's Musen's room!
1200000	1203000	Yeah, it was, it's like, not enough rage!
1203000	1205000	You know, I just love those things.
1205000	1212000	So, if anyone wants to find me, I get, I mean, go to Jamie's MySpace, I'm on MySpace, so
1212000	1214000	You're in my top eight.
1214000	1215000	She's in, I'm in her top eight.
1215000	1216000	You're in the Orange Lounge top, actually.
1216000	1217000	I am?
1217000	1218000	You are.
1218000	1219000	I feel so special.
1219000	1220000	You are.
1220000	1222000	Yeah, send me a note, I'll tell you who I am.
1222000	1225000	Seriously, I suck, I don't know how to type in general yet.
1225000	1228000	You know how, like, when you, so if somebody knows, please inform me.
1228000	1231000	I seriously don't, I know how, like, I know how to type.
1231000	1232000	You type slash one.
1232000	1233000	Really?
1233000	1234000	Slash one, space, and then whatever you want to say.
1234000	1235000	Oh, god dammit.
1235000	1239000	You know, it's just like, interesting things pop up, and it's really funny when the Horde
1239000	1240000	shows up.
1240000	1246000	It's like, because they got, like, a 60, like, what is it, a 70 level Horde came in the other
1246000	1251000	day, and like, there was like a billion people on that, on the server, and they all ganged
1251000	1254000	up on the Horde, and the Horde's sitting there like, ah, I killed everything, we killed
1254000	1255000	the Horde.
1255000	1256000	I love the Horde, I love the Horde.
1256000	1257000	I have actually a lot of Horde characters.
1257000	1258000	That's good.
1258000	1261160	It's just really funny when they show up, because I think they're all, the one, someone
1261160	1265480	explained to me, the Alliance is a bunch of noobs, who don't know, like, children who
1265480	1269000	don't know anything, and the Horde is a bunch of assholes.
1269000	1271000	Yeah, so I'm on the Horde side, definitely.
1271000	1272000	Yeah, of course.
1272000	1273000	I've got both, but.
1273000	1276000	Well, now that they have blood elves, you're starting to see a lot of the noob-ness on
1276000	1277000	the Horde side.
1277000	1279840	The blood elf males are the only ones that I can stand, because they're not all butch.
1279840	1280840	Well, they're very gay.
1280840	1281840	I know, I love them.
1281840	1285880	They're so, it's like, can I help you?
1285880	1290000	I'm looking, and Uni is jumping up and down, going, ooh, it's slash one, type slash one.
1290000	1291000	Thank you.
1291000	1293000	Uni's being very helpful.
1293000	1294000	Thank you.
1294000	1295000	She's noob-friendly.
1295000	1300600	Some people come up to me, you know what, that game is the most, WoW is the most frustrating
1300600	1304240	fucking game in the world, because there are people walking around you, and I'm not used
1304240	1305240	to that.
1305240	1306240	I'm not used to MMOs.
1306240	1307240	I've never played them.
1307240	1309320	And so, somebody comes up to me, do you want to duel?
1309320	1310320	No, thank you, decline.
1310320	1315120	Five seconds later, do you want to duel by the same frickin' person over and over and
1315120	1316120	over again?
1316120	1321000	I had to tell this guy, leave me the fuck alone, I'm on a quest, I have to get the candles.
1321000	1324240	Or what was Irene's story from, I think she told it on the air last week, she said something
1324240	1330380	about make wool, or something, and the guy traded the wool, and was like, no, I don't
1330380	1331580	do cloth guarding.
1331580	1335000	Back me wool, please.
1335000	1337880	Which totally didn't speak English, it was great.
1337880	1340120	So now her character is actually named back me wool.
1340120	1341120	Back me wool.
1341120	1342120	It's awesome.
1342120	1346320	So when you guys all come into Ravencrest to play on the official server of Orzammar
1346320	1349000	I'm going to get back and play, Aerie Peak, hi.
1349000	1351160	Oh no, we all band in Aerie Peak.
1351160	1355680	Aerie Peak, the problem with Aerie Peak, it's the first one on the list alphabetically.
1355680	1359400	Oops, none of us ever thought of that, so Aerie Peak went downhill real quick.
1359400	1360400	Ooh.
1360400	1361400	You can pay for my account and I'll play again.
1361400	1362400	Pay for your account, Jamie.
1362400	1363400	No, set up a PayPal.
1363400	1364400	I'll pay for your account.
1364400	1365400	Don't give me that look!
1365400	1372080	God, she gives me that look every time I offer to pay for something, shut up!
1372080	1373560	We'll talk about it after the show.
1373560	1374560	Okay.
1374560	1375560	Oh, I got that look.
1375560	1376560	I'm gonna get that look.
1376560	1379560	All you need to do is some sweet lovin'.
1379560	1382680	So I'm gonna go on break right now, hey guys, let's go in here, there's two of us.
1382680	1383680	Yeah, we'll be right back, guys.
1383680	1384680	Wow, wow.
1384680	1385680	All right.
1385680	1386680	They're fighting.
1386680	1389520	This is the hottest episode of Orange Lounge ever.
1389520	1396040	I can't believe we're offering to eat pussy over World of Warcraft.
1396040	1398720	Girls are gonna eat each other out over World of Warcraft.
1398720	1402520	Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.
1402520	1404520	Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.
1404520	1409720	Hey, to quote Randall, I love the cock.
1409720	1411480	I just had to defend myself here.
1411480	1412480	All right.
1412480	1413480	Oh, sorry.
1413480	1414480	All right.
1414480	1415480	Cock-loving Marissa.
1415480	1420960	Wait, wait, wait, how many of us have shoes off?
1420960	1421960	I have my shoes off.
1421960	1423960	My half-Japanese boyfriend would kick my ass.
1423960	1427040	If Marissa takes off her shoes, then it's Mississippi orgy.
1427040	1428040	Mississippi orgy!
1428040	1429040	All right.
1429040	1430040	Woo!
1430040	1431400	Explain the Mississippi orgy thing again for anybody who's new.
1431400	1437200	State law in Mississippi is that if three or more people, and at least one of them is,
1437200	1442720	I think, no, it's three more people with one person of an opposite gender in the room,
1442720	1444440	it's an orgy.
1444440	1445440	With your socks and shoes off.
1445440	1446440	Or with your shoes off.
1446440	1447440	I'm sorry.
1447440	1448440	There you go.
1448440	1451880	We are having a Mississippi orgy on Orange Lounge radio.
1451880	1453600	Jeremy Todd 1 says, I disagree, Rob.
1453600	1455800	The episode with the Mississippi orgy was the hottest episode ever.
1455800	1456800	Well, here you go.
1456800	1458440	That's why I told Marissa to take off her shoes.
1458440	1459760	Return of the Mississippi orgy.
1459760	1463680	Now we need some shine and we're set.
1463680	1466680	Marissa, I know you're not the biggest gamer in the world, but has there been anything
1466680	1467680	you've been playing lately?
1467680	1473000	Actually, I bought my first gaming system ever because I was just so obsessed with reliving
1473000	1476880	the adventure games with ScummVM that I actually finally went out and I bought a DS.
1476880	1481000	I'd like to personally thank Nintendo, I swear to God, for bringing women back into gaming
1481000	1484320	because every chick I know is so excited about the Wii.
1484320	1487880	So yeah, that's the first gaming system where I actually went, ooh, I want it.
1487880	1492780	You know, this is a very profound thing we're talking about here because from our perspective
1492780	1497780	as hardcore gamers, you're always reading on the game blogs about Nintendo's trying
1497780	1499920	to get the casual gamers back into gaming.
1499920	1502160	How can we get the casual gamers back into gaming?
1502160	1506440	So I ask you, you're saying the DS is the first system you have ever bought with your
1506440	1508480	own money.
1508480	1509480	What made you do it?
1509480	1512520	Well, I've always been broke so that has something to do with the fact that I didn't have one
1512520	1513520	before.
1513520	1521680	Quite frankly, PC gaming isn't the equivalent to a game system.
1521680	1522960	She wants Link's ass.
1522960	1523960	What?
1523960	1526320	She wants Link's ass.
1526320	1528920	The Rob D says, every chick I know is excited about the Wii.
1528920	1529920	I know, every chick.
1529920	1532360	Oh, the gaming system, never mind.
1532360	1534360	Get it?
1534360	1540680	Uh-huh, uh-huh, give me that.
1540680	1545240	The DS just offered something completely new as far as the touchscreen interface and you
1545240	1550760	could play Game Boy Advance, which was cool, you know, double deal.
1550760	1551760	And it's accessible.
1551760	1555920	I mean, it really is for people like me who are kind of dyslexic and all the buttons and
1555920	1557720	the functions, et cetera.
1557720	1559280	You know, and that's what they say.
1559280	1563940	Is it the fact that you look at an Xbox 360 controller and you're like, too many buttons.
1563940	1564940	What the fuck is that?
1564940	1566940	That's a spaceship.
1566940	1572840	Well, the original controller was a fucking spaceship for the original Xbox, that is.
1572840	1578800	But yeah, I mean, I think it could potentially get people into gaming again because it seems
1578800	1583400	like there isn't a single, I mean, I'm sure that there can be some recommendations, but
1583400	1587760	there aren't a lot of mainstream ways to just completely reintroduce somebody into gaming
1587760	1593320	who's used to the, you know, classic Nintendo, ah, God bless it, you know, two-button interface.
1593320	1599120	So I think that the Wii is a great, you know, I think they ultimately could become more
1599120	1602920	successful with more complicated gaming, et cetera.
1602920	1604640	But Cooking Mama is fun.
1604640	1606440	Oh, God, not another one.
1606440	1607440	Cooking Mama.
1607440	1608440	Oh, God.
1608440	1609440	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
1609440	1610960	I actually, I'm burnt out on it though, I will admit.
1610960	1612920	I went off the show.
1612920	1619440	A very special listener sent me pictures of Mama cosplay, which you'll hear about later.
1619440	1622560	Can I tell the Mama cosplayer, go outside, please?
1622560	1626120	It's on my phone, I'll show you, the Mama cosplayer was great.
1626120	1627760	You also need to go outside.
1627760	1631120	You know what, you need to bite my ass, but to quote Chris in a non-literal sense.
1631120	1634600	I do have to complain though, and this is really old school gaming, but my friend told
1634600	1639840	me to try to get into RPGs to try Morrowind, and I bought a video game to play, not to
1639840	1645080	read, not to walk every fucking where, I just had to say that.
1645080	1647280	However, here's a really awesome picture of me in a hat.
1647280	1652080	Have you ever, actually speaking of Morrowind, have you ever played Elder Scrolls Oblivion,
1652080	1653080	ever?
1653080	1656320	Like, it's kind of an adventure game, it's pretty as hell, off the show to you some day.
1656320	1657320	No, I haven't.
1657320	1658320	It's very pretty.
1658320	1659320	It's fun.
1659320	1661960	Well, I don't have an Xbox, but Chris has an Xbox, yes.
1661960	1662960	It's for 360.
1662960	1665200	He plays black all the time.
1665200	1668720	Wow, who's doing that cosplay, do we know?
1668720	1669720	That's funny.
1669720	1670720	It's some convention.
1670720	1671720	That's great.
1671720	1672720	See someone calling Mama.
1672720	1678720	Oh, is that something Mama sent you from the, oh, my bad, am I not supposed to spoil?
1678720	1679720	For the record.
1679720	1683480	I love that look, Jamie.
1683480	1684480	Stop pouting.
1684480	1685480	Bad Rob.
1685480	1686480	So cute.
1686480	1687480	Bad Rob.
1687480	1691280	All right, then let's keep the show moving so we can get to some news and whatever it
1691280	1692280	is.
1692280	1693280	I'll show you movement.
1693280	1694280	All right.
1694280	1695280	Bowel movement.
1695280	1699480	All right, anyhow, let's get to some gaming news, thankfully, oh, God, yes, we need some
1699480	1701560	gaming news here on this program.
1701560	1702560	So who's going to start us off tonight?
1702560	1705560	Oh, I know, we actually talk about games once in a while.
1705560	1708520	In fact, get this, you know what, Chris, we actually get some exclusives.
1708520	1711560	Those are like things you haven't heard anywhere else yet.
1711560	1712920	Oh, my God, really?
1712920	1713920	Exactly.
1713920	1714920	So, Loki.
1714920	1715920	That's amazing.
1715920	1716920	Loki's going to tell us.
1716920	1717920	She sounds like she's coming.
1717920	1718920	Never mind.
1718920	1721360	Why don't you all go back to whatever you were doing before?
1721360	1723280	Just, all right.
1723280	1728840	Anyways, so like last week how we had some exclusive dates for the Microsoft games, today
1728840	1731840	we come with a brand new company, Midway.
1731840	1736520	We have a whole lineup for their games and the core subject of the change, you know,
1736520	1741120	like a certain Halo 3 date, you know, which I still believe that that game.
1741120	1746280	Oh, yes, I forgot to mention the Halo 3 official teaser came out this week and there it is
1746280	1748780	right there, Fall 2007.
1748780	1752560	And Loki had said on this show previously, what, April or May or something?
1752560	1753560	May, but...
1753560	1754560	Wrong.
1754560	1758160	Well, here's why, okay, and I have a couple reasons why I think they're doing this.
1758160	1761680	One, it's a big Christmas, you know, they don't have a big Christmas game coming out.
1761680	1765920	Two, I think they thought that the PlayStation 3 was going to be in a better position to,
1765920	1767800	you know, where there might actually be a threat.
1767800	1772200	You know, right now I don't see PlayStation 3s flying off the shelves and they certainly
1772200	1776520	don't have the lineup for it, so, you know, you don't need to put the game out right now.
1776520	1780200	And to be honest, I think the game will probably be done by May, but they'll just hold it until
1780200	1783140	Christmas, you know, so they can capitalize on that stuff.
1783140	1786800	So lesson learned about the distribution dates, I mean, we've said it before, this isn't anything
1786800	1789800	we didn't tell you when we said the Halo 3 date the first time, dates are subject to
1789800	1790800	change.
1790800	1793520	Retailers push things back all the time, you read about this on blogs, so we can tell you
1793520	1797640	how things are now, but unforeseen circumstances will push games back.
1797640	1802920	One perfect example of this would be Stranglehold for PlayStation 3 and the 360.
1802920	1806440	Originally that was scheduled to be out, what, December of last year, and now it's pushed
1806440	1811120	all the way, it's my birthday by the way, September 11th, and it'll be also available
1811120	1815560	in the collector's edition, which is, it looks like a pretty cool game, you know, John Woo
1815560	1817360	and stuff.
1817360	1823040	Anyways, Mortal Kombat Armageddon for the Wii is scheduled to come out April 18th, and
1823040	1826240	that looks actually pretty fun.
1826240	1832480	Also we'll be getting Hour of Victory on the Xbox 360, yet another World War II first person
1832480	1834280	shooter.
1834280	1840200	Also Blacksite Area 51, also scheduled for September, September 12th on PlayStation 3
1840200	1841540	and 360.
1841540	1847040	Also in September, Unreal Tournament 3 on the 360, that's the 19th.
1847040	1855840	And then Mortal Kombat's coming out on the DS on October 17th, why?
1855840	1860920	I mean has there ever been a good handheld Mortal Kombat, ever, ever?
1860920	1863080	If you have a Nomad.
1863080	1864080	Okay I don't.
1864080	1866480	Well, a Nomad's just a Genesis.
1866480	1867480	But you said handheld.
1867480	1868480	That's cheating.
1868480	1869480	No it's not.
1869480	1870480	You cheated.
1870480	1871680	You're a cheating cheater.
1871680	1877000	Also scheduled the same date, Wheelman, on PlayStation 3 and 360, that brand new Vin Diesel
1877000	1880380	movie slash game, that's going to be coming out.
1880380	1883120	Some other interesting stuff from Nintendo, they're going to have the official Nintendo
1883120	1888560	headset for the DS coming out April 22nd, and a couple delays, well actually one delay
1888560	1893720	here for you, MLB 07, the show for the PlayStation 3 has been delayed to April 24th.
1893720	1894720	So yay.
1894720	1895720	Lots of dates.
1895720	1898720	All right, well thank you very much for those dates.
1898720	1903060	Looking at the chatroom, Fireboma says Mortal Kombat better be Wi-Fi.
1903060	1904060	Maybe that's the reason to have it on DS.
1904060	1906060	Actually, Tekken Dark Resurrection, that's a good point.
1906060	1907060	Who said that?
1907060	1908060	That is a good point.
1908060	1909060	There was also...
1909060	1910060	Alpha Canagram.
1910060	1911060	Good job.
1911060	1915040	Mortal Kombat Deception's Unchained on the PSP that came out in November.
1915040	1918680	All right, so I think back to those crappy Game Boy ones.
1918680	1919680	Come on.
1919680	1920680	Surely you played...
1920680	1922960	Like they had characters cut out of them, and they were bad.
1922960	1923960	Oh, Game Boy.
1923960	1926640	I mean, come on, you can't really play a game with like two buttons anyway.
1926640	1927640	Why bother?
1927640	1931720	At least with the DS, you've got six buttons, so you can at least do kind of what you had
1931720	1934360	on the Super Nintendo, at the very least.
1934360	1935800	All right.
1935800	1940680	Well, speaking of things that are announced, this time in the arcade, we don't talk about
1940680	1944660	the arcade scene an awful lot, but obviously, if you know the history of Orange Lounge Radio,
1944660	1949280	we started as a station for the first few years we were doing this, we were strictly
1949280	1952520	about music games and what was going on with the music-based games.
1952520	1956200	So of course, Dance Dance Revolution is a game we've loved for a long time.
1956200	1958760	That's how we all met, actually, was through DDR.
1958760	1965040	So with great pleasure, we can talk about DDR Supernova 2, which was officially announced
1965040	1967560	at AOU 2007.
1967560	1970720	Of course, DDR kind of came back after a little slumber.
1970720	1973980	DDR hibernated for a little while and came back with Supernova last year.
1973980	1979700	And now, that's all you have, though, is there was a little teaser poster that just said
1979700	1982120	Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2.
1982120	1983120	That's really all we know.
1983120	1985840	It's coming, but that's a good sign.
1985840	1988880	Are you surprised?
1988880	1991240	For me, yes, because it's arcade.
1991240	1994880	If this was a home version, no, that's not a surprise at all.
1994880	1998920	But as far as a arcade release goes, yeah, I think it is a little bit of a surprise.
1998920	2003360	Because of the fact that DDR took such a long break, I think to get a new game announced
2003360	2007840	so quickly, despite the rumors of the 200, 300 song expansion, whatever it is, which
2007840	2011360	is probably this, I think it's great.
2011360	2014320	I wonder what that says, because I can't read Japanese, obviously.
2014320	2017960	So it says 2000, I wonder if it's like spring, fall, summer.
2017960	2023200	Let me give it a look, but I will do that after I deliver some other news to us.
2023200	2030840	Why the hell does this look like, I want to say, like some crappy Pokemon logo or something?
2030840	2032840	Where's the damn poster?
2032840	2036440	Because Pokemon's very lame.
2036440	2038840	Chris has problems with you calling Pokemon lame.
2038840	2044360	And Pokemon is the only game that I really, truly loved first.
2044360	2048320	You know, DDR Supernova 2, I think it's going to be a Jewish game, if you notice there's
2048320	2051000	like almost like a Star of David in the background there.
2051000	2052000	Wow.
2052000	2058080	You know, our resident Jew in the room has made a face in regards to that.
2058080	2072320	Actually, Loki's married to a Jew too, so he gets to make the jokes through proxy.
2072320	2077840	He's into Judaism, if you know what I mean.
2077840	2081160	Marissa's boyfriend is half Japanese with a very Japanese mother, so she gets to make
2081160	2084080	all the Japanese jokes, so she's okay by proxy too.
2084080	2085080	There you go, alright.
2085080	2086080	Good.
2086080	2088840	Do I get to make Jewish jokes because I know you?
2088840	2090680	But I am!
2090680	2091680	Dammit.
2091680	2102720	Okay, I do believe that that says, looking at that, that is, I want to say winter.
2102720	2106840	I'm pretty sure that that's the kanji for 2007 winter.
2106840	2109800	Kyle Snyder's in chat, who's somewhat of a well-known DDR persona.
2109800	2110800	Hi Kyle!
2110800	2113280	And he thinks the following will show up in Supernova 2.
2113280	2115320	These are the official Kyle Snyder predictions.
2115320	2121400	Fly Away remix, Stargate Heaven, Future Love mix, Flow, Jem and Reggae mix, VJ Army, G2
2121400	2122640	and Outer Limits.
2122640	2124880	I wouldn't mind if VJ Army showed up.
2124880	2125880	That would be rad.
2125880	2126880	Alright.
2126880	2132880	Well, you know what else is absolutely completely 100% rad and even more super cool than DDR?
2132880	2133880	Me.
2133880	2134880	Me!
2134880	2135880	Your mom is cooler than DDR.
2135880	2137640	Which is true because I like your mom.
2137640	2139640	Your mom's really cool.
2139640	2140640	Okay.
2140640	2142360	But not in a, not in a, you know.
2142360	2143360	Not in a homosexual way.
2143360	2144360	Not in a MILF way.
2144360	2145360	Okay.
2145360	2146360	Alright.
2146360	2151280	Um, but Silent Hill is coming to the arcade, and yes, I know, everybody already knows about
2151280	2154040	it, so shut up.
2154040	2155040	There is...
2155040	2159160	Orange Lounge Radio reporting the news you already know about.
2159160	2166040	There is a Silent Hill in development for the arcade, not really major too much about
2166040	2170360	it out, it's just called Silent Hill the Arcade, supposed to be a gun game with a big curtain
2170360	2171360	around it and...
2171360	2172360	That's like a lasso.
2172360	2174360	Ooh, Pyramid Head.
2174360	2177960	But, um, it looks really blurry.
2177960	2181600	Well, I'm thinking it's just going for the look of Silent Hill, like it's probably going
2181600	2183760	to be foggy and have that whole ambience to it.
2183760	2187400	I'm sorry, the PlayStation 2 looked better than that.
2187400	2190140	That curtain's gotta go.
2190140	2191140	That curtain isn't gonna last.
2191140	2192140	That curtain that's on the thing, though, yeah.
2192140	2195960	Little kids at Golf Land will rip that shit off in five seconds.
2195960	2199920	My whole fear regarding this, though, is that it's gonna turn and it's gonna be like House
2199920	2204360	of the Dead clone, and it better not be, or I will personally go to Konami of Japan with
2204360	2205520	a tank.
2205520	2207440	I will tape that.
2207440	2212080	If Akira Yomoka has anything to do with this, I'm okay with it, because I know I respect
2212080	2213080	that man so much.
2213080	2216960	If it's really cool, I will personally, I mean, hug him.
2216960	2219640	Mercy, are you a big Silent Hill fan?
2219640	2222640	I'm sorry, Chris, we were not making it up to you.
2222640	2226240	I don't go see a lot of movies, not because I'm a hermit, because I don't like paying
2226240	2228240	eight dollars and seeing a movie that sucks.
2228240	2231240	I drive my feet, stick to the floor, and the smell of vomit or whatever else goes on in
2231240	2233600	the theater.
2233600	2235600	So I haven't seen a lot of movies.
2235600	2237040	Do you like scary games?
2237040	2238800	You ever thought about playing a scary video game?
2238800	2242760	I was the best girlfriend in the world when I bought my boyfriend, who couldn't afford
2242760	2243760	anything.
2243760	2250040	I bought him a, neither could I, technically, I bought him a GameCube, and god damn it,
2250040	2252040	I'm having an eternal darkness.
2252040	2253040	Resident Evil 4.
2253040	2259640	I bought him Resident Evil for the GameCube, and he just had a heart attack.
2259640	2265280	I like the suspenseful games, but sometimes they can just piss you off, and make you want
2265280	2267320	to kill something, like in the game.
2267320	2268320	Trauma Sender!
2268320	2270200	Trauma Sender is amazing!
2270200	2273000	Trauma Sender makes me want to kill things.
2273000	2274000	Oh!
2274000	2276160	Stab your knife into the patient.
2276160	2279320	I love, that's my favorite thing to do when I get frustrated in Trauma Centers, I just
2279320	2282600	whip out the scalpel and go, just start stabbing the patient.
2282600	2283600	Just start trying to kill the patient.
2283600	2284600	Exactly.
2284600	2287520	You know what I like to do in Trauma Center now that I'm in school to be a massage therapist?
2287520	2289120	Let's begin the operation!
2289120	2292840	I like tracing out their muscles, because I know where they are now.
2292840	2294880	Blaze says Trauma Center equals love.
2294880	2299400	By the way, just because I'm proud of myself, I made a 92 on my anatomy test.
2299400	2300400	Yay!
2300400	2301400	Back to games.
2301400	2302400	Can I get a technical geek on?
2302400	2303400	Can I get a technical geek on?
2303400	2304400	Is that a SM58?
2304400	2305400	I have no idea.
2305400	2312400	So now I totally know how to relax the piriformis when you have sciatic pain.
2312400	2319480	Speaking of Silent Hill, when does this come out?
2319480	2324480	I did know, and then I closed the article.
2324480	2325480	Let me down.
2325480	2326480	No!
2326480	2330000	No, they don't actually say.
2330000	2334480	I just hope the curtain was just to protect the press at this arcade show, because that
2334480	2335480	curtain is so old.
2335480	2337280	It would only be in America that the curtain would be in any game.
2337280	2342760	The curtain was basically to give it a dark, eerie feeling.
2342760	2346000	The curtain gives you the feeling of playing it in a hefty bag.
2346000	2349000	That's what the curtain gives you the feeling of.
2349000	2353520	If they want to really make it a thing, they should do it like how that crap-tastic Jurassic
2353520	2362280	Park game is, where you can sit down.
2362280	2370240	If they come out with the typing of the Silent Hill, I will retire from video game everything,
2370240	2374120	because everything I need in the world has been done.
2374120	2376760	I still play Typing of the Dead.
2376760	2380400	What if it were like Guitar Freaks crossed with Silent Hill?
2380400	2381400	That's stupid.
2381400	2383800	It would be Ki-Tar that you read.
2383800	2386240	Pyramid Head rocks out.
2386240	2390680	You have to fight them with the power of rock.
2390680	2392400	That's Guitaro Man gone lame.
2392400	2398720	No, we should have Silent Ki-Tar.
2398720	2399720	Cassio the Shooting!
2399720	2404560	You can kill them with Hall and Oates, okay?
2404560	2407600	You can kill anyone with Hall and Oates.
2407600	2413360	Speaking of slightly lame, let's talk about Tekken 6.
2413360	2415880	Yes, Tekken 6 is slightly lame.
2415880	2416880	Why?
2416880	2420200	Because the screenshots in the trailer that they've shown of it look kind of lame.
2420200	2423920	And not even really up to par to Virtua Fighter 5.
2423920	2427920	But nonetheless, we'll be coming to arcades soon.
2427920	2432680	And we'll be featuring also two new characters, Leo and Zafina.
2432680	2435760	Both of which look very generic.
2435760	2437480	So hooray.
2437480	2443600	But it looks like it will have the same visual quality of Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.
2443600	2444600	And um...
2444600	2448700	Okay, wait, what were the characters' names again, Leo?
2448700	2449700	Leo and Zafina.
2449700	2452040	Okay, now keep in mind I've never seen pictures of these characters.
2452040	2453400	I don't even know if they've leaked out.
2453400	2456280	But I'm going to make some bold predictions, okay, knowing the Tekken series.
2456280	2460280	I'm going to say Leo is shirtless.
2460280	2470840	And Zafina has humongous breasts that will bounce.
2470840	2473000	You're wrong about shirtless.
2473000	2476560	Every character in Tekken is shirtless.
2476560	2480280	Even one of the chicks, I think.
2480280	2485400	Leo looks like a chick, who also looks like someone that was ripped from Final Fantasy
2485400	2486400	X.
2486400	2490080	No, Leo looks like one of the Bogards, a little bit.
2490080	2492600	Okay, Leo looks like a chick, anyways.
2492600	2493600	And then...
2493600	2495200	That's a guy.
2495200	2504680	And then Zafina, well, she's your chick that's, you know, of course she has big boobs, but...
2504680	2505680	She's your...
2505680	2506680	You ain't bad.
2506680	2507680	Your ethnic chick.
2507680	2508680	What, is she a belly dancer?
2508680	2509680	What the hell is that?
2509680	2510680	Probably.
2510680	2511680	Your belly...
2511680	2512680	That's so wrong.
2512680	2513680	I don't know.
2513680	2514680	Oh well, easy access, I suppose.
2514680	2516800	Either way, it looks kind of neat.
2516800	2520440	They're going to have, it looks like from the trailer, they're going to have different
2520440	2523360	ways you can kind of build up your characters and stuff.
2523360	2527780	I don't know, it looks okay, but really, do you really need to push better graphics with
2527780	2528780	fighting games?
2528780	2529780	Just make it fun.
2529780	2530780	Yay.
2530780	2531780	Yay for that, actually.
2531780	2533720	Marisa says she's yay for that.
2533720	2534720	Alright.
2534720	2540440	So they do need to push more boob physics with Dead or Alive 3, or Dead or Alive 5,
2540440	2541440	I guess that would be.
2541440	2545920	Jamie, you're a Tekken fangirl, are you excited about Tekken 6, or is this a little too much
2545920	2547440	of one thing, or what?
2547440	2551560	I'm always excited over anything that has Jin in it.
2551560	2554320	Yeah, I was going to say, as long as Jin's in it, right?
2554320	2555880	And Asuka now, because Asuka's kind of...
2555880	2560440	Well here, I'm going to write a letter on Jamie's behalf to Namco.
2560440	2563440	Dear Namco...
2563440	2564440	May I?
2564440	2565440	May I?
2565440	2566440	May I?
2566440	2567440	May I?
2567440	2568440	Sit down.
2568440	2569440	Shut up.
2569440	2570440	Let me speak.
2570440	2571440	Okay, here we go.
2571440	2572440	Rob, you talk too much.
2572440	2573440	I know.
2573440	2574440	Even our fans think so too.
2574440	2575440	No, I know.
2575440	2576440	It's funny.
2576440	2577440	Okay, then here's my letter.
2577440	2578440	Dear fans, suck it.
2578440	2579440	Alright, here we go, back to Jamie's letter.
2579440	2580440	No, no, that's G4.
2580440	2581440	Dear Namco Bandai.
2581440	2582440	Jin!
2582440	2590440	Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
2590440	2591440	No, no, no, no.
2591440	2592440	Love, Jamie.
2592440	2593440	No, no, no.
2593440	2596440	Jin has also carried over to Asuka.
2596440	2597440	P.S.
2597440	2598440	Asuka!
2598440	2599440	P.S.
2599440	2602560	Oh my god, boobs.
2602560	2604440	Mike W. says, my ears bleed.
2604440	2606320	Rondo of Blood, the fighting game.
2606320	2609200	Fireboma says, write it in blood.
2609200	2612160	Uni says, I'm going to smack Rob for not being nice to D.S.
2612160	2613160	I bite back.
2613160	2617560	For the record, I'm so sick of how many shadows your game could fucking render if it still
2617560	2618560	sucks.
2618560	2620920	For the record.
2620920	2625160	That's how we feel, but we don't know how to put it so eloquently to the developers.
2625160	2627400	Would you like to write a letter to the developers of games?
2627400	2628400	What if it went like that?
2628400	2629400	Alright.
2629400	2636260	It's like, great, now you have a really shiny, highly rendered piece of shit.
2636260	2642320	That dookie looks mighty fine, I mean, I can see like, it's obvious you ate corn.
2642320	2650080	It's like, wow, she looks really lifelike, too bad that she clips through people and
2650080	2651080	is stuck in the stage.
2651080	2654760	I love the blood elves in World of Warcraft because they levitate over bridges because
2654760	2658440	the clipping is so awful.
2658440	2660040	In certain places they do.
2660040	2664520	Anyhow, let's talk about something very sexy.
2664520	2668940	Besides me, Ikaruga is a shooter game.
2668940	2669940	You know Ikaruga, right?
2669940	2675560	It's like the one where you press buttons to change the color of your show because there's
2675560	2678520	like red bullets and I think it was purple bullets and red bullets.
2678520	2682160	It's like black and white, but the black is kind of purplish.
2682160	2683160	It's so awesome.
2683160	2687600	You have these bullets and you need to change the color, it's such a great shooter.
2687600	2691600	What's happening is that Ikaruga is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade and the way
2691600	2696520	they found this out was on an Xbox 360 debug unit through the partner net.
2696520	2698800	And I think somebody a little later is going to be talking a little more about this whole
2698800	2705520	partner net leak thing, but certainly Ikaruga was the highlight of the games announced for
2705520	2706520	that, so that's very sexy.
2706520	2707520	Ikaruga is sexy.
2707520	2708520	Ikaruga is a sexy ass game.
2708520	2710800	We need radiant silver guns still though.
2710800	2714880	So I'm very excited about that, that'll be awesome.
2714880	2718560	Ikaruga, that is just like so, well I'll tell you something else though that's relatively
2718560	2719780	sexy.
2719780	2725800	That is if you are a big collector like me and a SKU has shown up at GameCrazy, which
2725800	2731080	I cannot confirm for my husband's GameCrazy because he hasn't seen fit to tell me, sorry,
2731080	2737560	for a black Xbox 360 and it has been confirmed by several GameCrazies.
2737560	2743160	Isn't this like the fourth week in a row there's been some type of black Xbox 360 story on
2743160	2744160	the internet?
2744160	2750200	Yes, and GamersReports.com would like to let you know that they had the story first because
2750200	2752360	it's posted on every single follow up story.
2752360	2755340	It's on every freaking gaming site once, look I don't give a shit about that.
2755340	2763180	What I want to ask about is who cares, take a Sharpie to the Xbox 360 you have now and
2763180	2766160	make it black if you care that much.
2766160	2768160	Dark Soccer, why?
2768160	2770320	The original Xbox was black.
2770320	2772800	But we had the Halo one.
2772800	2777360	Yeah but here's the thing though about it, I think it's not really a fact that it's black,
2777360	2780660	it's just that it's going to have a 120 gig hard drive supposedly and they think that's
2780660	2783000	also going to have an HDMI out.
2783000	2784240	I can tell you right now.
2784240	2785240	And a bigger penis.
2785240	2789800	I can tell you right now either way it's just going to be a disappointment.
2789800	2793180	That's all it's going to be is a big disappointment for you.
2793180	2798200	So great they're going to announce that, they're going to announce the 512 card or memory unit
2798200	2802920	or whatever and everybody's like oh yay we can download more crap.
2802920	2809640	I'm sorry I just had to weigh in on this subject because I think Nintendo, it's the stupidest
2809640	2811640	thing in the world but I think they made a big mistake with the GameCube.
2811640	2815440	Well actually I got my X for the GameCube but they made it purple.
2815440	2817840	Because guys were afraid of having a purple GameCube.
2817840	2820320	Hey be glad that we didn't get the orange one.
2820320	2821320	Mine was silver.
2821320	2825320	It was indigo okay.
2825320	2828040	It was blue and by the way I had the black ones so.
2828040	2829040	In Japan they had orange ones.
2829040	2830040	That makes you extra hetero.
2830040	2831040	Okay the black ones.
2831040	2835400	Tigerclaw says Sky you know that old saying once you go black you never go back.
2835400	2836560	Is that true Dark Soccer?
2836560	2839000	Is that why you need the black Xbox 360 so bad?
2839000	2841960	I want it to match my Saturn.
2841960	2842960	Among other things.
2842960	2847280	Here's the thing though about you're going to get this nice fancy black Xbox 360 and
2847280	2855000	then oh wait the controllers are white, the Xbox HD DVD player is white, oh wait the remote
2855000	2856000	is white.
2856000	2857000	Hmm that sucks.
2857000	2862920	I really don't give two shits, maybe half of one but you know it's for people who say
2862920	2870440	oh wait you know fine you've got a new one but whatever and for the record the Sega Saturn
2870440	2873560	did initially come out in white in Japan.
2873560	2874560	Do we really need.
2874560	2875560	Check your sources.
2875560	2880040	James Patrick asked in chat Dark Soccer should sell the halo one they're worth a bit of money
2880040	2881040	now.
2881040	2882040	Um the fuck I will.
2882040	2884960	Yeah I know I have a halo one as well.
2884960	2885960	Why would I sell it?
2885960	2887680	What would I play my Xbox games on?
2887680	2893960	Keep in mind if I sell my Xbox that drops me down to 42 video game systems.
2893960	2895800	I have an orange one.
2895800	2897800	But 42 is the answer to everything.
2897800	2903240	Gaming Nerd says I'd love a nice pink 360 to match my pink PS2.
2903240	2906200	In related news Gaming Nerd is my favorite chatter ever.
2906200	2916040	Actually when I replace my JPS2 I'm going to get the Sakura PS2 which is sort of a purpley
2916040	2917040	color.
2917040	2918040	Purpley.
2918040	2921920	And it's the Sakura one so it's mine.
2921920	2922920	Mine.
2922920	2923920	Anyways.
2923920	2925640	I do I have my own brand of condoms.
2925640	2927840	Speaking of partnering that a little bit.
2927840	2928840	What?
2928840	2931200	Well did she say that in a mic?
2931200	2932880	Yes I did.
2932880	2936800	Okay you know you know that okay I gotta tell you this this is totally off the subject but
2936800	2941960	I gotta say okay I think over at All Games Interactive you know our buddy show our sister
2941960	2946560	I think Scott likes to tease you a little bit on that show because he'll yell out random
2946560	2952480	things like I like blueberry muffins and then he'll say he's just impersonating dark sakura
2952480	2955280	and now I totally see where that comes from.
2955280	2957800	I have my own brand of condoms.
2957800	2958800	What?
2958800	2963600	No pass the mic to Chris.
2963600	2967760	Jamie and I when we hang out we go down to Japan town and we go to Ichiban-Kon.
2967760	2968760	Ichiban-Kon.
2968760	2969760	Ichiban-Kon thank you.
2969760	2973800	And they've got a bunch of imports from Japan and one time we found Sakura condoms.
2973800	2975920	I'm like Jamie look your condoms.
2975920	2979240	And Chris said that and I repeated what she said only I had the mic in my hand.
2979240	2980240	Yeah see.
2980240	2981720	So that wasn't random you just weren't paying attention.
2981720	2982720	I was.
2982720	2983720	Bad host.
2983720	2984720	Hold on.
2984720	2985720	Bad host.
2985720	2986720	Whatever.
2986720	2987720	Whatever.
2987720	2988720	Those are Sakura brand those are not dark sakura.
2988720	2989720	It's one third your show too.
2989720	2991840	But they were in a dark box.
2991840	2992840	That does not count.
2992840	2993840	Yes it does.
2993840	2999560	That's just like saying okay that would be just like saying oh the Whitman chocolates
2999560	3003520	out there oh they must be my brand chocolates because it's very close to my last name white
3003520	3004520	man.
3004520	3006040	You can go outside and look up.
3006040	3009720	It's me Skye.
3009720	3010720	You could do that.
3010720	3011720	Any.
3011720	3012720	Anyways.
3012720	3016040	I think that also put you in the category of I invented the internet.
3016040	3019640	By the way I am everywhere.
3019640	3020640	Sorry Loki you had something to say.
3020640	3021640	Are you finished?
3021640	3022640	Are you finished?
3022640	3023640	Yes we're finished.
3023640	3024640	Thank you.
3024640	3025640	So let's talk about partner net.
3025640	3029760	Partner net's been around forever and then I guess just everybody forgot their NDA's
3029760	3034280	regarding partner net because you do not talk about partner net that's first rule of partner
3034280	3035280	net.
3035280	3036280	Yeah right.
3036280	3037280	Yeah right.
3037280	3043000	Everyone I know who's ever had partner net which isn't us because we're not cool enough
3043000	3045000	they they they blab partner net.
3045000	3049480	I mean we we're we know enough that you don't post it on blogs and things but oh god.
3049480	3051880	People who have partner net don't show up.
3051880	3052880	Anyways so.
3052880	3053880	They think they're special.
3053880	3058000	So yeah it they found someone took some video of it and they found out about more pic or
3058000	3059880	more games coming out.
3059880	3061400	None of which I'm too surprised about.
3061400	3063120	I mean some of these have already been announced.
3063120	3066920	Rare's jet pack you know game that's coming out later on they've already announced that.
3066920	3069200	Juice 2007 already been announced.
3069200	3071360	Absolute who the hell knows what that is.
3071360	3072360	Obzpinball yay.
3072360	3074360	Joe Pinball.
3074360	3078720	Tetris Online which I think might actually be that Tetris Evolution or whatever that's
3078720	3083360	coming out in March whatever or maybe another downloadable game.
3083360	3087880	Great two different Tetrises and then some Halo 2 maps that were already announced.
3087880	3092960	So yeah very exciting.
3092960	3095120	Great great more stuff coming out.
3095120	3097100	You know like I said you can't talk about them.
3097100	3101040	Although there are other websites so I've I was reading some comments that they were
3101040	3105280	posting that will actually do partner net updates on their blog but I guess they're
3105280	3109800	so far under the radar that no one notices that they're doing that stuff.
3109800	3111280	That's great.
3111280	3115440	But yeah that's a good way to get yourself in a lot of trouble with Microsoft.
3115440	3118680	You know breaking NDA like that so.
3118680	3123920	Yeah apparently one of the bigger sites that had a movie got asked to take it down.
3123920	3126960	Ooh snap.
3126960	3132320	Anyhow something else that came down just about as fast as it went up was the Xbox rewards
3132320	3133320	challenge.
3133320	3134320	Remember this?
3134320	3138240	You can inflate your internet penis by increasing your gamer score by fifteen hundred points
3138240	3142320	and you win I don't know crappy gamer pics in a crappy game fusion frenzy in the highest
3142320	3143320	level.
3143320	3146040	Well everybody tried to register it once and the site just blew up.
3146040	3148440	I mean nobody could get on there nobody could register.
3148440	3152200	Even now that you can get on there register the site is still kind of clunky when I got
3152200	3155000	on there and finally registered it was clunky.
3155000	3160560	Well Xbox's little concession for this whole thing is that they have extended the Xbox
3160560	3162200	reward challenge by three days.
3162200	3166000	So you have three whole more days to extend your gamer score by fifty hundred points and
3166000	3169660	people are bitching and complaining because they were like dude I took the day off of
3169660	3174440	work so I could be the first to inflate my gamer score so I could make sure that I'm
3174440	3179080	one of the ones that gets this game because you only said so many copies would be out
3179080	3183760	there and I'm saying if this is you my personal opinion of you is that you need to go out
3183760	3188000	and get a fucking life because seriously if you took the day off of work to stay home
3188000	3193720	and increase your gamer score for this competition Microsoft does not owe you anything.
3193720	3197780	Microsoft made the game Microsoft made the system that is what you bought.
3197780	3202560	This whole rewards thing is like somebody giving you something for free.
3202560	3204300	Microsoft did not owe you this.
3204300	3205940	Why are you so mad over that?
3205940	3208920	That's why I refuse to get mad about this I mean yeah it was a little frustrating as
3208920	3211800	I tried to go on the site but it's like you know what it's free stuff.
3211800	3215640	Quit your bitching and get like one of those diamond cards for free and then go get discounts
3215640	3216640	at other places.
3216640	3220800	Or go get a whore and have sex and get some of that energy out of your system because
3220800	3226280	seriously if you're getting that bent out of shape over the rewards program something's
3226280	3229180	wrong like a free game.
3229180	3230180	The grand prize is a free game.
3230180	3233960	Fusion Frenzy 2 which by the way is like one of the lamest games out there right now.
3233960	3236520	I know it's not even worth it I'm sorry.
3236520	3241660	So I'm like I'm sure people know that Fusion Frenzy 2 is not even worth it so I can think
3241660	3247100	of no other reason why people want to do this other than to say look at my giant internet
3247100	3248100	cock.
3248100	3253400	I got the free game in the Microsoft contest and let me be the first to tell you it's just
3253400	3255920	like you got into the Halo 3 beta.
3255920	3258800	Fucking everyone got into the Halo 3 beta.
3258800	3260480	Who cares?
3260480	3264100	My girlfriend's cock is bigger than yours.
3264100	3265100	It is.
3265100	3270420	You know what though if I if I went to somebody's house and they have it on display that's not
3270420	3274960	unlike well I have a friend that owns a magic card shop and they show me those player cards
3274960	3278740	you know with the pictures of the expert magic player it's like a guide of who not to have
3278740	3280740	sex with.
3280740	3285660	I'm sorry it is.
3285660	3293900	I mean I think Marissa I see Marissa speaking for like the girls who are like kind of just
3293900	3298100	not really associated with video games she's like from the outside oh okay well DS is cool
3298100	3303360	and you know so she comes in and sees you know a bunch of people freaking out over video
3303360	3306260	games and she goes wow I'm not fucking them.
3306260	3310460	Well who gives a crap if they you know they don't want to have or they're not going to
3310460	3312500	get you know laid by a girl.
3312500	3316740	That cuts into precious time that they could be earning more gamer score points.
3316740	3322540	Okay everyone I have dated has been a nerd okay this is on the record if anyone out there
3322540	3329020	knows Kaylee and SS Kaylee and a big anime music video editor so I put in my time and
3329020	3333020	I'm a music nerd okay that's all I have to say about that.
3333020	3339420	She's showing her creds she's literally whipping out her she's whipping out her cock and putting
3339420	3340840	it on the table.
3340840	3345740	I spent every day at school lunch in the library okay I have I put in my nerd time.
3345740	3353620	I have put in my time all right wow all right well anyway that's that's all I have to say
3353620	3356420	on the Xbox rewards program sorry for the little rant.
3356420	3361420	Well you know what that's pretty shitty however speaking of Microsoft and shitty but not in
3361420	3367620	a shit but okay I should say Microsoft and shitty but like not shitty.
3367620	3373180	We've been discussing Forza 2 lately the release date is in May in the United States.
3373180	3382240	It has been confirmed that it will be released in the UK in May this year so just to give
3382240	3385180	a little bit of background on that there are going to be a lot of different cars in this
3385180	3395460	there are 15 Ferraris, 2 Maseratis, 5 Lamborghinis, 13 Porsches, pretty much a lot of good stuff
3395460	3400000	there's actually I'm going to have the 1987 Porsche 959 in there so that's pretty cool.
3400000	3404100	So it's looking like a pretty cool racing game if you're into that sort of thing and
3404100	3411340	it will again have a May release in the UK as well as in the U.S. the PAL version sorry.
3411340	3413860	Isn't that nice?
3413860	3419740	That's pretty awesome and of course we're getting a lot more releases over here as well
3419740	3426180	not just Forza 2 which is still way off but this week though we've got some good stuff
3426180	3430580	including brand new Wii games Sonic and the Secret Rings is going to be finally heading
3430580	3435800	over to us so hopefully that one won't suck as bad as I know I don't know much about this
3435800	3441580	Sonic but will it redeem the series it looks to me honest it looks just like the older
3441580	3446620	Sonic games so I think that this will actually be pretty decent.
3446620	3451720	I haven't played it though so I can't say the control issues are going to still be there
3451720	3461580	even with the Wii being brand new systems and stuff and new control sets but I hope
3461580	3465980	it looks like it has some party games in it that are pretty fun so hopefully.
3465980	3470860	Other stuff coming out though we're going to have Virtua Fighter V on the Playstation
3470860	3475020	3 that's going to be coming out this week which is pretty awesome on the 360 the game
3475020	3481420	I've been playing and you've got to pick it up Crackdown as well also on the 360 there's
3481420	3487140	going to be NBA Street Home Court that one's going to be pretty awesome on the Playstation
3487140	3494020	2 Arena Football 2 Road to Glory if you're into that alternative type of game.
3494020	3504980	Then of course on the PC here we've got Supreme Commander on PC.
3504980	3509620	On the Playstation 3 download service Flow is supposed to finally make its way on the
3509620	3517780	22nd let's see here on the DS Ozuna Legend of the Unemployed Ninja which should be pretty
3517780	3528660	interesting and then also on PC Warfront Turning Point and also that's about it as far as the
3528660	3530780	good stuff.
3530780	3536860	Alright well moving on over to Japan where the video games come from a lot of times but
3536860	3541020	also you know especially when it comes to Xbox 360 the U.S. kind of gets them first
3541020	3544940	usually but it looks like they're doing a simultaneous release with Riot Act which is
3544940	3548740	what they're going to call Crackdown over in Japan Riot Act is coming out this week
3548740	3553820	over in Japan Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent also gets a release on the 22nd of February

3577060	3582760	out on February 22nd coming out on the Playstation 2 you get a whole lot of stuff over in Japan
3582760	3585660	what I thought was interesting though is that they're getting Destroy All Humans on the
3585660	3592140	Playstation 2 so a game that was popular enough over here made its way over to Japan so Lupin
3592140	3597100	the Third there's a Lupin 3 coming out in Japan I love Lupin the Third there's a whole

3760040	3763500	Hot Pixel was that one PSP game that's kind of like WarioWare, right?
3763500	3767220	It's not coming out until August here, I think.
3767220	3770220	Hey, our UK friends get games first!
3770220	3772900	Wow, it's a first! Good job, UK!
3772900	3776100	Yeah, but too bad the game didn't look that good.
3776100	3778220	Too bad the guy's kind of crazy, he's like this old dude.
3778220	3781180	Oh yeah, that's right, he was talking to us and he was kind of creepy.
3781180	3783020	I got his card but I felt like...
3783020	3786380	Well, he's not going to come on the show now, sorry.
3786380	3789700	I just called him creepy. He has his own podcast, by the way.
3789700	3791020	Does he? I bet it's creepy.
3791020	3793360	Anyways, um...
3793360	3804180	So, apparently in the UK, there's this wonderful show called Watchdog that they investigate companies and stuff like that
3804180	3811420	that have either defective products or, you know, it's kind of like, I want to say there was something like this on Dateline
3811420	3815700	or something where they investigate different businesses and make sure that they're up to par or whatever.
3815700	3822660	So they're investigating Microsoft about the Xbox 360 because apparently they're saying that the...
3822660	3830620	You know, they have received 248 complaints about faulty Xbox 360s and, you know,
3830620	3836180	they're saying that the return rate was, you know, larger than Microsoft initially said
3836180	3841580	and that the fact that the owners had to spend, or some of the owners had to spend around 80 pounds
3841580	3851700	or about $156 to fix each of the units that just so happened to break after, you know, a year of purchasing the system.
3851700	3854860	You know, at the same time, I just...
3854860	3861140	Aren't they a little late on this? You know, I mean, wasn't this whole defective 360 story like about a year ago?
3861140	3862500	I... I don't know.
3862500	3864780	It takes time to build these cases, though, don't forget.
3864780	3869260	And it is the UK and, you know, everything's delayed, unfortunately with them, so...
3869260	3876580	Anyways, so Microsoft, of course, responded saying that the claims made by the show are, you know,
3876580	3883860	false, that the return rate of the Xbox 360 is significantly lower than the CE industry average of 3-5%.
3883860	3888020	Customer satisfaction is our highest priority and we do everything that we can to take care of the gamers
3888020	3889980	who may have problems with their consoles.
3889980	3895700	Anybody having an issue with their 360 should call customer service immediately so that we can help.
3895700	3902100	And, you know, to be honest, though, they did increase their warranty period for the 360 and...
3902100	3903700	I don't know, I think they're doing their part.
3903700	3907900	I mean, I would say, how are these 360s being broken?
3907900	3910020	I mean, if it's people, you know...
3910020	3914940	I still hear my customers talking about, oh, yeah, this game came back scratched because there's a ring in it now
3914940	3922940	because, you know, someone's jiggled their 360 while it's going and it carved a big ring into their disc.
3922940	3925940	So people are dumb.
3925940	3930340	I thought the X meant I shake it.
3930340	3934460	What? The system's not like the Wii controller? It's not motion sensitive?
3934460	3936980	Actually, to be honest, the system is motion sensitive.
3936980	3940900	It will know if you're laying it flat or if you're laying it upright.
3940900	3942660	It's true, it's true.
3942660	3946900	But that's a little, yeah, that's a little tiny little bubble that does that probably.
3946900	3952220	Anyhow, speaking of watchdog agencies, the biggest watchdog of them all is the government.
3952220	3959460	And Sam Brownback is a senator, a Republican senator, and he's also somebody who is running
3959460	3967460	for president in 2008, at least in Kansas, and he's exploring the Republican nomination
3967460	3968980	for the president of the United States.
3968980	3976980	Well, Sam Brownback is also one of the minds behind the Video Game Rating Act, and it has been reintroduced.
3976980	3982100	It was first introduced last September, but it is now being reintroduced for Senate.
3982100	3986940	If this was made law, what would happen is that the ESRB, you may remember us talking about this back in September,
3986940	3992300	the ESRB would have to play the final build of a game from the beginning to the end
3992300	3995940	until they could actually give it a rating.
3995940	3999380	Because I believe the way the ESRB works now, they're just filling out a questionnaire.
3999380	4002340	Maybe they play a little bit of the game, but that's about it, right?
4002340	4007020	Yeah, it's the same way the MPAA works, and I don't see anyone cracking down the MPAA.
4007020	4009940	I think the movies and the games should be done the exact same way.
4009940	4011460	Why not? Why not?
4011460	4017940	I think movies, TV, and games should all be done the exact same way. Why not?
4017940	4023740	Let me give a quick quote, and I think Marissa wants to chime in too.
4023740	4032300	Video game reviewers should be required to review the entire content of a game to ensure the accuracy of the rating.
4032300	4038140	The current video game rating system is not as accurate as it could be because reviewers do not see the full content of games
4038140	4042380	and do not even play the games they rate.
4042380	4046420	Boy, they're going to be screwed when they have to review Oblivion or an MMO.
4046420	4047220	Anyway, Marissa?
4047220	4049100	This issue in particular gets me really passionate.
4049100	4053380	I watched a great documentary called This Movie Is Not Yet Rated the other day about the MPAA.
4053380	4054420	I don't know if you've seen it.
4054420	4059780	I've heard of it, and I really want to see it, but I've heard it's just like Super Size Me resonated with McDonald's.
4059780	4061980	I heard this movie resonated with the MPAA.
4061980	4066540	The government should not step in, but interestingly enough, I think there's a problem when the industry regulates itself
4066540	4068300	because it creates a monopoly.
4068300	4073140	I don't understand, like, for movies, for example, you can go to website kidsandmine.com,
4073140	4075740	and it just lists specifically what is in the movie.
4075740	4079780	I don't think a rating system is a good idea because then people interject their opinion into it.
4079780	4084420	If you want to say there is sex in this, there's et cetera, and I know this is a really old Mimi,
4084420	4089580	but it still amazed me that people got upset about the hot coffee mod in Grand Theft Auto,
4089580	4093980	but they didn't have a problem with the fact that their five-year-old kid was killing hookers, et cetera.
4093980	4098220	Now, I like the game myself, but why is sex the problem?
4098220	4100220	Perfect example, the hot coffee thing.
4100220	4105260	I mean, granted, it was an interactive little mini-game, whose graphics were really bad, by the way,
4105260	4109540	but yet I don't hear anyone complaining that there's a fucking sex mini-game in the original God of War
4109540	4113780	and in God of War II, which there's full fucking titties in the goddamn game.
4113780	4114740	Because it wasn't hidden.
4114740	4115660	This wasn't...
4115660	4116700	Oh, it's not hidden.
4116700	4117260	Big deal.
4117260	4118460	It's an M-rated game.
4118460	4122540	The difference between a 17- and 18-year-old, can you really say mindset-wise?
4122540	4125300	I mean, granted, okay, one's a legal adult,
4125300	4129100	but mindset-wise, one's gonna know about boobies as much as the other one.
4129100	4131900	That's because they need to pull the corncob out of their ass
4131900	4134700	and stop fucking promoting a double fucking standard.
4134700	4138660	How would you feel if the video game was the exact same thing as the movie?
4138660	4140740	You pick up the box and on the back it says,
4140740	4143580	this game is rated R for sexuality and language.
4143580	4145740	And it still says sexual content.
4145740	4146740	Isn't that how they do it in Europe?
4146740	4148140	Yeah, the UK, it's the same system.
4148140	4151900	Okay, it said it was rated M for sexual content.
4151900	4153300	It was on there.
4153300	4156940	It didn't specify saying, oh, it's rated because of this minigame.
4156940	4158500	It said sexual content.
4158500	4160020	So this is really getting...
4160020	4162220	Now you're starting to get into semantics here about,
4162220	4166100	oh, well, is this sexual content that made it M-rated and not this sexual content?
4166100	4166980	Who gives a shit?
4166980	4170420	It's M, it says sexual content.
4170420	4171860	Do we need to do anything else?
4171860	4172460	No.
4172460	4172900	You know what?
4172900	4175140	People are stupid and there's a lot of...
4175140	4177380	I mean, no, I'm not saying this about everybody
4177380	4178940	because we have parents that listen to this program
4178940	4181660	and you're probably smart because you know how to download a podcast.
4181660	4184340	But there's a lot of stupid parents out there.
4184340	4187140	And for their benefit, you know, I'm going to give a little here.
4187140	4189660	It's about the world works with compromise, right?
4189660	4193220	My compromise is, okay, we will make one rating system.
4193220	4196780	So you don't have to think like, okay, I'm not that smart, so I have to translate.
4196780	4200220	And M means like an NC-17, okay?
4200220	4202540	Let's use one rating system across the board.
4202540	4203860	That's my compromise.
4203860	4205860	That way you stupid people don't have to memorize more than one system.
4205860	4209020	I'm pretty sure that's how we do it in Europe, isn't it?
4209020	4211260	And that makes perfect sense.
4211260	4216620	You know, as actually, it's funny, sort of related to that,
4216620	4220900	our good friend Rob with two Bs, I wasn't going to cover this in the mailbag,
4220900	4226900	but he sent me an article about parents were suing MySpace
4226900	4231420	for their daughter lying about being 18.
4231420	4234300	My sister says she's 19.
4234300	4235940	I'm not finished.
4235940	4239780	And their daughter going to meet up with this guy and then getting the hot nookie on.
4239780	4241820	And the parent was sued.
4241820	4245740	Well, as the article states, the judge was like, fuck you.
4245740	4247340	It was your job to police her.
4247340	4249740	That is the wrong person to be suing.
4249740	4250860	They need to sue the internet.
4250860	4252580	Internet is the blame.
4252580	4253900	Sue Al Gore for an event again.
4253900	4255740	Just to go ahead just a little bit into it.
4255740	4259180	It was a 12-year-old Texas girl lied about being 18,
4259180	4262940	met a 19-year-old man for dinner and a movie, and had some hot nookie.
4262940	4266620	And then the parents tried to sue MySpace for $30 million,
4266620	4268100	accusing the site of negligence.
4268100	4272140	But the judge in the case, Judge Sam Sparks, turned around.
4272140	4274940	And I quote, if anyone had a duty to protect Julie Doe,
4274940	4277780	it was her parents, not MySpace.
4277780	4281020	All right, and what's in Judge Sam Sparks?
4281020	4284340	Judge Sam Sparks is our American Citizen of the Week.
4284340	4284840	Yay.
4289840	4293260	Our hats off to you for telling this parent to go fuck herself.
4293260	4295980	The reason why I think it was worth noting
4295980	4302220	is that, and actually, our RobOTV's also mentioned it,
4302220	4305820	that this might actually set a precedence now
4305820	4309140	for future cases involving parental negligence.
4309140	4309740	I'm sorry.
4309740	4311500	I just get really passionate on this issue
4311500	4312900	for being exceptionally yappy.
4312900	4314980	But I mean, I agree with the idea of a rating system
4314980	4318020	because it is unfair that children feel a lot of pressure
4318020	4320100	nowadays to be hip and cool, et cetera,
4320100	4321820	and they want the same things we do,
4321820	4324220	which is a completely different rant of mine.
4324220	4325060	Sex?
4325060	4326140	Sex is cool, too.
4326140	4328020	But it's a completely different rant of mine
4328020	4330540	that we need to allow children to still be children and not
4330540	4331300	little adults.
4331300	4333900	But anyway, the only beef with the rating system
4333900	4337900	is, though, is that the GPG, et cetera, that, again,
4337900	4340020	is a personal opinion.
4340020	4342420	And actually, though, I think it makes it easier for parents,
4342420	4345060	for those who approve of more sexual content
4345060	4347660	because their own opinion or approve of less violence
4347660	4349340	or more violence, et cetera, you just
4349340	4351460	say explicitly what is in the game that
4351460	4353220	is different than saying, well, I believe
4353220	4355760	that this is because there's 12 different kinds of rated R
4355760	4356260	movies.
4356260	4358940	So there could be 12 different kinds of rated R games.
4358940	4360620	I know you look at a movie like Romeo and Michelle's
4360620	4362580	High School Reunion, that movie is rated R,
4362580	4364340	yet it's probably one of the most harmless movies
4364340	4364980	I've ever seen.
4364980	4368100	Like, it gets rated R because Janine Garofalo says fuck
4368100	4369180	like three times.
4369180	4370980	And then you look at a movie like Sin City
4370980	4372620	that's rated R, where like, you know,
4372620	4375060	fucking bullets through heads, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
4375060	4377140	every other minute, titties everywhere.
4377140	4379380	You know, there's a big, big difference.
4379380	4380860	Well, here's the other thing, too.
4380860	4382580	And I hate how they always say, oh, we
4382580	4385860	need to put more responsibility on the ESRB
4385860	4386860	and rating these games.
4386860	4388460	No, you have to put more responsibility
4388460	4390740	on these parents who just ignore the ratings.
4390740	4393020	And they say, oh, I didn't know this content was in here.
4393020	4394460	Yeah, you didn't know because you didn't read.
4394460	4396380	And then you bought it for your five-year-old
4396380	4398700	because you'll do anything for your five-year-old
4398700	4400620	and you won't even question it.
4400620	4403940	You'll just like, OK, I'm going to buy him a fucking porno
4403940	4404440	then.
4404440	4406540	I mean, seriously, if that's going
4406540	4411220	to be such an issue with you, it's just I don't understand.
4411220	4413700	And I don't understand how, OK, granted the content
4413700	4414620	was hidden in the game.
4414620	4416580	OK, yippee, it's hidden in the game.
4416580	4420420	So if I created, say, a series of GameShark codes
4420420	4424780	or something like that and made a topless mod for Tomb Raider,
4424780	4429980	a very elaborate process I might add that would probably be,
4429980	4431820	then we get to sue IOS over that.
4431820	4434620	I mean, this is stuff that was created by someone else.
4434620	4436660	It wasn't even in the final version of the game.
4436660	4440020	And basically, you've pointed out
4440020	4442460	that this content is in there for parents that didn't know.
4442460	4444620	And even the parents that are suing about this
4444620	4446740	didn't know how to access the content in the game
4446740	4448820	or wasn't even aware.
4448820	4449940	Can I say this real quick?
4449940	4450980	I want to keep it moving.
4450980	4453560	But I got to say, I blame the media to some extent, too.
4453560	4457020	Because I bet if half the parents saw what the Tomb Raider
4457020	4460980	mod looks like or actually saw the mini game, they would go,
4460980	4463300	that's so stupid.
4463300	4465540	But parents listen to what the media says.
4465540	4469660	And the media says, did you know your child can do real fucking
4469660	4472260	in Grand Theft Auto, like power-fucking
4472260	4474900	with the X button, coming to Grand Theft Auto tonight
4474900	4476020	on Xdrop?
4476020	4479800	You know, and I think parents go off of what they hear
4479800	4481940	and not what they're actually seeing.
4481940	4484300	There's so much of that sensationalism that I think
4484300	4485900	takes everything to the nth degree.
4485900	4487260	I don't actually agree with that.
4487260	4488920	I'm just going to say this really quick.
4488920	4492500	Because do you remember how big that Super Bowl thing
4492500	4494500	with Janet Jackson was?
4494500	4498660	Her titty was on television for a half a second.
4498660	4500420	But it was covered.
4500420	4501300	It was covered.
4501300	4503740	It went and fucking freaked out, though.
4503740	4508180	It was covered with a stupid nipple shield.
4508180	4510700	I saw the exact same thing on Fucking Girls
4510700	4513860	Next Door, where she had a stupid sticker over her nipple.
4513860	4515340	And then that was acceptable.
4515340	4516260	It wasn't a sticker.
4516260	4517380	It was actually a piercing.
4517380	4519500	Dude, my grandma came out once and didn't
4519500	4520740	realize I was in the room.
4520740	4521860	And I didn't sue her.
4521860	4523260	Movies kill.
4523260	4525660	Movies kill.
4525660	4528060	It might have made me gay, but I didn't sue her.
4528060	4530180	I'm just kidding.
4530180	4532180	That's not what made me gay.
4532180	4534300	I firmly believe it's a biological thing.
4534300	4538620	Anyway, yeah, cock made me gay.
4538620	4541740	All right, anyhow.
4541740	4544700	Rheoma in chat says, Sky, never talk about that again.
4544700	4545740	But I'm serious.
4545740	4547920	I mean, what kid didn't accidentally
4547920	4553660	see a titty at some point, or a dick?
4553660	4556180	Duke Nukem had boobies in it, too.
4556180	4559220	Yeah, pixelated 8-bit boobies.
4559220	4560660	I mean, that's what they look like.
4560660	4562900	That's hot.
4562900	4565140	All right.
4565140	4568500	Anyhow, moving on.
4568500	4571460	Every week, we invite you to give your feedback here
4571460	4573980	on our program through our mailbag, among other things.
4573980	4575700	We like to be an interactive program.
4575700	4577300	Because it's not just about us.
4577300	4580260	It's not just about the three of us that run this program.
4580260	4583020	It's not just about Marissa or Chris or any of the other folks
4583020	4583620	you've heard.
4583620	4586200	Chris thinks it's all about her, but it's actually not.
4586200	4589140	We invite you guys to interact with us by the chat room,
4589140	4592740	by the voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
4592740	4595660	or through the email bag, which you can email us every week
4595660	4597460	at mailbag at orangeontraday.com.
4597460	4599060	We love getting your emails.
4599060	4601860	And DarkSakura, she's the queen of the mailbag.
4601860	4604180	She likes to jump in there and pull out
4604180	4605380	some of her favorite emails.
4605380	4606140	She's going to do that right now.
4606140	4607220	I'm going to pull it out.
4607220	4616060	I'm going to pull it out.
4616060	4618580	You should have said that on mic.
4618580	4622540	And GS68 says, and you penetrate her weak point
4622540	4624620	for massive damage.
4624620	4626020	Mailbag, please.
4626020	4627620	General alien crab bag.
4627620	4628580	I mean, wait.
4628580	4629820	Sorry.
4629820	4630780	Only.
4630780	4634660	WTB, mail.
4634660	4635460	Rob.
4635460	4636100	What?
4636100	4638620	Whatever.
4638620	4640260	Four emails.
4640260	4645900	The first one from, I'm not sure exactly what to say,
4645900	4646700	the nickname ask.
4646700	4648300	Can we try something new tonight?
4648300	4650420	When you say that we're going to do the first email,
4650420	4653140	what I'd like Chris to do is to say very sexily,
4653140	4654900	letter number one.
4654900	4655940	All right, so here we go.
4655940	4657460	So can we start from the top, please?
4657460	4660420	All right, here we go.
4660420	4662940	Say the first email.
4662940	4664340	OK, Chris.
4664340	4666020	Letter number one.
4666020	4667420	All right, very good.
4667420	4669740	Dear Rob, DarkSakura, and Loki, I just
4669740	4671540	wanted to say hello to you all and tell you
4671540	4672780	how much I enjoy your program.
4672780	4674940	I've been listening for a little over a year now.
4674940	4676740	I actually first found out about you guys
4676740	4679740	when looking for websites that were optimized to view on my PSP.
4679740	4682260	Hint, hint, hint, hint.
4682260	4683940	OLRPSP.com.
4683940	4685540	Anyway, what's the deal with Rice Princess?
4685540	4688060	She has a filthy, filthy mouth and is incredibly offensive.
4688060	4689820	You should have her on the show more often.
4689820	4691900	Keep up the good work.
4691900	4693060	Is Rice Princess still here?
4693060	4694980	Let me go find Rice Princess.
4694980	4697020	Talk smack about Rice Princess quick before I get her in here.
4697020	4700740	Oh my god, Irene is so, no.
4700740	4704500	I'm going to skip the, I'm going to go on to the next email.
4704500	4708100	Email number two.
4708100	4711780	You sounded like you had to go to the bathroom.
4711780	4713140	Oh, wait a minute.
4713140	4715500	We just read one of your fan letters on the program.
4715500	4716180	Oh, god, who won?
4716180	4718340	Is it true that you have an offensive, filthy mouth?
4718340	4719060	Fuck yeah.
4719060	4721820	Do you know any dirty jokes you can tell our listeners this week
4721820	4724500	because our emailer said they liked having you on the show
4724500	4726060	because you had a very offensive mouth.
4726060	4728180	So we just wanted you to say something offensive.
4728180	4730700	OK, poop.
4730700	4731700	That's pretty offensive.
4731700	4734020	That was on an offensive scale of 1 to 10.
4734020	4734940	That was like a 3.
4734940	4738820	OK, how about you lick the crusty poop out of my butt
4738820	4740900	and then you lick the crusty poop off my finger.
4740900	4742340	OK, I'm going to go.
4742340	4743180	OK, that was a 9.
4743180	4743700	That was a 9.
4743700	4744380	That was much better.
4744380	4745620	All right, thank you, Rice Princess.
4745620	4746940	Thank you for your contributions.
4746940	4747660	Do you want me to read it?
4747660	4749780	It's a good thing we haven't done any more your mama jokes.
4749780	4750300	All right.
4750300	4750820	Me too.
4750820	4752060	Do you want me to do it again?
4752060	4752940	Yeah, you already did.
4752940	4754740	OK.
4754740	4757100	OK, I already did the email.
4757100	4763020	This one is email number 2 from SpeedyF40.
4763020	4765700	A year and a half ago, I tuned into OLR for the first time
4765700	4767380	after finding it on Podcast Alley.
4767380	4771340	I was not hooked, but like a festering rash, the good kind.
4771340	4773740	Your show grew on me, and a year and a half later,
4773740	4775340	I am still here.
4775340	4777380	I have tuned into every show since that.
4777380	4779020	Orange Lounge Radio.
4779020	4781700	We're like the good kind of festering rash.
4781700	4783980	That's a really good compliment.
4783980	4787740	Rob, you guys are like the festering rash.
4787740	4791260	We're the festering rash of my love.
4791260	4795380	Could somebody who has not written a review on iTunes yet,
4795380	4797380	somebody in chat volunteered to do this?
4797380	4800220	OK, I want somebody in chat to yell out, claim this.
4800220	4803100	Go to iTunes and give us a five star review, which actually
4803100	4804700	everyone should do, hint, hint.
4804700	4806720	But I don't want everybody saying
4806720	4808080	the show is a festering rash.
4808080	4810300	So I want one person from chat to nominate themselves
4810300	4812460	to go write a five star review on iTunes and put,
4812460	4816140	this show is the festering rash of gaming podcasts.
4816140	4816860	The good kind.
4816860	4817580	The good kind.
4817580	4821740	Genital herpes is forever, and so is my love for Orange Lounge.
4821740	4823900	And that, OK, somebody can lay claim to that one too.
4823900	4824620	I like that one.
4824620	4826020	Can I finish reading this now?
4826020	4827260	Yes, you may.
4827260	4827780	OK.
4827780	4829100	Fester, Jamie, fester.
4829100	4831300	Bite my butt, but not really.
4831300	4833860	And you have even used one of my calls on air.
4833860	4835420	I love independent radio, and I feel
4835420	4838060	that your show is doing a service to the gamer community.
4838060	4841100	OLR has even inspired me to do my own show.
4841100	4845540	Loki, you suck because you don't like Max.
4845540	4846940	No, that's really not what he said.
4850140	4851660	OK.
4851660	4853380	He didn't say that.
4853380	4855460	I know some people may see you as an ass.
4855460	4857940	You are, just not all the time.
4857940	4860460	Most of the time I see you as an honest down to earth realist.
4860460	4862980	Loki, you set this story straight,
4862980	4864980	and your ties with the inside of the gaming world
4864980	4868260	give the show a sense of added credibility.
4868260	4872860	By the way, Apples do suck for gaming by a PC.
4872860	4874260	I would say in two to four years,
4874260	4876300	Apple computers will be a formidable gaming
4876300	4878020	computer for the average person.
4878020	4879540	Real gamers will stick with the PC,
4879540	4881380	but that is a whole other thing.
4881380	4883820	Jamie, your alternative views on gaming and the gaming culture
4883820	4886580	broaden my mind and keep ideas flowing through my head.
4886580	4888460	I love how you speak your mind, even though I
4888460	4890420	know we will have some political differences.
4890420	4891940	I hold your opinions on issues that
4891940	4893700	affect gamers in extremely high regards.
4893700	4894700	Well, thank you.
4894700	4896660	That makes me feel warm in a special place.
4896660	4898700	My ex-boyfriend actually had a good quote on that.
4898700	4903420	He said, Macintosh makes the best computer out there.
4903420	4905580	You know what the problem is?
4905580	4908660	Nobody cares.
4908660	4910620	Do you have another email, actually?
4910620	4911420	There's more.
4911420	4913060	OK, I want to do the sexy announcement,
4913060	4914900	because on the internet, I'm kind
4914900	4918140	of geek famous for being the voice of a character on LJ
4918140	4919020	Drama.
4919020	4920020	OK.
4920020	4921900	All right, well, the third one is to Rob.
4921900	4922500	Oh, yay.
4922500	4926500	You got a lot of balls being a gay gamer on the internet.
4926500	4928260	Pun intended.
4928260	4931300	When I jumped on air for my own show,
4931300	4937220	I would have to say that I model some of my on-air presence
4937220	4938180	from yours.
4938180	4941500	With me being straight guy, I come off
4941500	4942820	as being very enthusiastic.
4942820	4947460	I just don't get messages telling me I talk too much yet.
4947460	4950140	I love O-L-R. It is polished, and it is brilliant.
4950140	4952500	From your unconventional views on gaming and gaming culture
4952500	4955020	to the straight up format of the show, I love it.
4955020	4957660	I would not be who I am today on the internet and in real life
4957660	4958780	if it was not for you guys.
4958780	4960040	Independent radio for the win.
4960040	4960780	Speedy F40.
4960780	4962780	P.S. Tell Rice Princess I have a crush on her
4962780	4964680	because she sounds like a freak.
4964680	4965180	Wow.
4965180	4967100	Hey, Irene.
4967100	4968580	You have a fan.
4968580	4970300	That's very, oh, wait.
4970300	4972340	Didn't he say he ran his own podcast?
4972340	4973220	What is it?
4973220	4973940	Didn't say.
4973940	4975300	Is this his Speedy F40?
4975300	4976980	Is there like a signature or something?
4976980	4978780	He has a crush on you because you're a freak.
4978780	4979380	That's what he said.
4979380	4980260	Is you're a freak.
4980260	4981500	Speedy F40.
4981500	4982000	Oh, hi.
4982000	4983500	Dude, if you're listening, and we're
4983500	4985620	pretty sure that you are because you're amazing,
4985620	4988380	send us a link to your podcast, and we'll plug you.
4988380	4989100	Totally.
4989100	4990340	We want to pimp that podcast.
4990340	4992900	We will totally plug you in the most awesome way.
4992900	4996100	Seriously, not to spend too much time talking about ourselves.
4996100	4998180	Because I don't want to be like that.
4998180	5001460	But that's truly one of the best compliments we could ever get.
5001460	5002460	Oh, wait, it's on here.
5002460	5003140	Oh, wait, is it?
5003140	5003980	Oh, great.
5003980	5008420	WCradio.com, 5 PM Eastern time on Saturday.
5008420	5011300	Oh, it's part of the WC Radio, Warcraft Radio,
5011300	5012540	like a huge radio thing.
5012540	5013420	Really, it's Warcraft?
5013420	5014180	Yeah, isn't it?
5014180	5014820	Warcraft Radio.
5014820	5019540	Or maybe this is just a, I'm not sure if this is his or not,
5019540	5021740	but it's in the signature.
5021740	5023580	So check it out, maybe?
5023580	5027220	Well, hey, if you were going to spend all day playing
5027220	5029180	World of Warcraft, I know the soundtrack gets old,
5029180	5031380	so you might as well listen to Warcraft Radio, right?
5031380	5032340	So go for it.
5032340	5033940	That's very cool.
5033940	5035980	And that's truly one of the best compliments.
5035980	5038180	But can I say something about the gay issue
5038180	5040620	without turning the show too gay as it is already?
5040620	5042060	It's already gay.
5042060	5044820	It's actually not really been a big deal
5044820	5046180	for me to be gay on this program.
5046180	5049060	Because I give a lot of props to the gaming community.
5049060	5052540	And I think the youth in general is that I really
5052540	5054100	don't think people seem to care.
5054100	5056180	And I think if they do care, they're not listening.
5056180	5057940	So hey, all for the best.
5057940	5059940	This probably isn't their type of show anyway.
5059940	5061540	If it was something they care about,
5061540	5063780	they'd probably want to listen to bigot Radio.
5063780	5066620	But most people that have listened to this program
5066620	5067420	really don't care.
5067420	5069660	I think that speaks volumes about the gaming community
5069660	5072740	is that, hey, there's nothing wrong with being gay.
5072740	5075740	But I don't want this to be the gay show either,
5075740	5077260	because that's not all I am.
5077260	5079580	And I think people get that wrong impression about me
5079580	5082100	sometimes is that I'm the gay gamer,
5082100	5085540	and that's all I can think about is how much cock is in my games.
5085540	5088580	At least you're not the titty queen.
5088580	5091140	Yeah, we plug the lesbian thing on me just because it's funny.
5091140	5094340	It's for the straight men.
5094340	5096900	This segment is getting entirely too gay.
5096900	5097580	All right, sorry.
5097580	5098260	I just want to sit.
5098260	5099820	Talk about your joystick some more.
5099820	5100940	Wait, wait, sexy, please.
5100940	5102460	Except that boobs are hot.
5102460	5104660	Oh, I was just going to say, it's not all gay radio
5104660	5106500	unless you talk about your joystick too much.
5106500	5108100	Rawr.
5108100	5109860	Oh, oh.
5109860	5112740	Hi, it's me, Victoria.
5112740	5115860	Email number three.
5115860	5116700	Dude, that was hot.
5116700	5117660	That was hot.
5117660	5120540	I got a semi.
5120540	5123660	Hey, OLR, I started World of Warcraft for the New Year.
5123660	5126780	I fell in love with WoW until I installed the Burning Crusade
5126780	5127780	expansion pack.
5127780	5128900	Oh my god, oh my god.
5128900	5131940	No, I would not interrupt you if this is not the best thing ever.
5131940	5132980	You interrupt me all the time.
5132980	5134860	No, I would not do this if this is not the best thing ever,
5134860	5135360	DarkSaga.
5135360	5135860	Trust me.
5135860	5138580	DJ Jenai says, maybe we should rename the show
5138580	5140660	to the games and you show.
5140660	5142220	G-A-Y, games and you.
5146460	5148460	I don't understand, but it went and started up.
5148460	5150420	So I reinstalled it like two times,
5150420	5152740	and eventually I just called Blizzard.
5152740	5154360	They told me that my graphics card just
5154360	5156980	happened to not be compatible with World of Warcraft.
5156980	5159140	He told me, luckily, I was able to play for a while,
5159140	5160820	but once I installed the expansion pack,
5160820	5161980	it stopped working.
5161980	5166500	I have a VIA S3G Unicrome Pro ITG graphics card.
5166500	5168620	So just don't want anyone who plays World of Warcraft
5168620	5169380	or is starting.
5169380	5173140	Just make sure that you should upgrade to a new graphics card
5173140	5178140	if you have the VIA S3G Unicrome Pro ITG graphics card.
5178140	5180820	So he has, like, an in the groove graphics card.
5180820	5181320	What?
5181320	5183020	Look.
5183020	5184820	He's got an in the groove graphics card.
5184820	5186220	Oh, IGT?
5186220	5188460	No, that shoots a hole in my joke.
5188460	5190860	PS, my cousin bought Burning Crusade for my birthday,
5190860	5192780	and now I can't play World of Warcraft at all.
5192780	5194300	Nice birthday present, isn't it?
5194300	5195420	Aw, don't cry, emo kid.
5198300	5199660	Tough advice from Chris.
5199660	5202780	I reinstalled it, and it was a pain in the ass.
5202780	5205820	But I've got a Mac, so I don't need to upgrade anything.
5205820	5207580	Next.
5207580	5208900	Wait, what number?
5208900	5210380	Shut up, Rosa.
5210380	5212620	This is from Let's Have Tea.
5212620	5213940	Email what?
5213940	5215020	Number four.
5215020	5217900	Email number four.
5217900	5219700	Hey there.
5219700	5220260	I don't know.
5220260	5222420	I think my semi went away, because she sounded 17.
5222420	5225260	Fuck you.
5225260	5228380	Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.
5228380	5230860	Hey there, OLR, Let's Have Tea here.
5230860	5233060	I have been a longtime listener, even though I have only
5233060	5235100	actually tuned into the live show a few times,
5235100	5236020	podcast for the win.
5236020	5237760	That's not what this email is about, though.
5237760	5239180	A few weeks back, you were talking
5239180	5241640	about the Wii being used as a fitness weight loss tool.
5241640	5244900	I was digging through Dig, ha, and came across a few
5244900	5245860	interesting articles.
5245860	5247900	One article was showing how somebody lost nine pounds
5247900	5250620	playing Wii Sports for 30 minutes a day for six weeks.
5250620	5252460	He didn't change his normal eating habits at all.
5252460	5253940	He just played the game more.
5253940	5256220	And that's because it's exercise.
5256220	5259980	Also, it's activity for 30 minutes.
5259980	5261660	It will raise the heart rate.
5261660	5265460	I burn weight doing massage three days a week for 30
5265460	5267460	minutes, so yeah.
5267460	5270020	You do any kind of exercise for 30 minutes a day, it's
5270020	5270620	going to do something.
5270620	5273100	If you don't eat McDonald's during that same length of
5273100	5274820	time, you'll lose twice as much.
5274820	5276780	Yeah, exactly.
5276780	5279260	Also, I saw another article about wrist weight with the
5279260	5280740	Wii logo on them.
5280740	5284460	Sure, they were fan-created concept products, but there
5284460	5286140	are similar products out there for similar workout
5286140	5287260	activities.
5287260	5289300	Would any of you consider using one of these wrist
5289300	5290980	weights while playing an actual workout tool?
5290980	5293220	I considered getting a pair of generic ones to make it
5293220	5296900	harder to play Wii tennis and actually give my friends a
5296900	5298060	chance at beating me.
5298060	5299580	What do you think of the whole Wii fitness idea?
5299580	5304980	Just to let you know, and this is just because of my recent
5304980	5308380	involvement in the health industry, I am not prescribing
5308380	5309420	nor recommending anything.
5309420	5313580	This is not a prescription, just to protect my ass.
5313580	5318460	You do run a risk of damaging your wrists using a wrist
5318460	5320580	weight with anything that you have to flick or
5320580	5323060	move your wrist with.
5323060	5325940	Wrist weights are actually not all that safe to use.
5325940	5326420	Exactly.
5326420	5331260	No one wants to break their masturbating wrist.
5331260	5339460	My problem is I would not want to put more effort into it.
5339460	5344380	I say stand up and do it, because you burn more
5344380	5345620	calories standing up.
5349860	5353020	My problem is that I would not want to wear the wrist
5353020	5355220	weights, because I would be afraid that my wrist would
5355220	5357940	hang down more than it already does.
5357940	5360020	Then you'd look uber gay.
5360020	5361500	There's a visual there.
5361500	5366660	You know, uh, radio visual joke.
5366660	5369060	Here, I got some advice.
5369060	5372500	Get up and go to the fucking gym.
5372500	5375900	I have no patience for people who sit there and say, you get
5375900	5377660	a great workout playing the video game.
5377660	5378620	No, you don't.
5378620	5380700	Actually, yeah, you do if you play DDR.
5380700	5383220	That's not the same thing, though.
5383220	5384140	Actually, not.
5384140	5384700	OK.
5384700	5386540	I can give you DDR.
5386540	5388820	I did get up and play.
5388820	5391540	It's a difference if you actually get up and move your
5391540	5393940	arm as opposed to sitting on the couch
5393940	5395220	and flicking your wrist.
5395220	5398180	If you get up and get into the game, you actually are
5398180	5399340	elevating your heart rate.
5399340	5401620	You are actually burning more than you are sitting down and
5401620	5403140	flicking your wrist.
5403140	5405260	Yeah, but you need to also stop eating junk food.
5405260	5407260	And you need to go outside in the sunshine.
5407260	5409180	And you need to check yourself into a gym so
5409180	5411300	you don't turn fat.
5411300	5413180	I see it as like steps.
5413180	5416100	Like if you want to do a little bit that's better than
5416100	5417340	nothing, you do the Wii.
5417340	5419900	If you want to go all the way in, you do the gym.
5419900	5421460	It's kind of like different levels.
5421460	5425860	I think that Wii Sports is a great springboard into
5425860	5427900	building up activity levels, especially if you've been
5427900	5429980	living a sedentary lifestyle.
5429980	5433660	If you're going from Uber, couch, internet, potato, to
5433660	5437220	moving, playing the game, first of all, that's actually
5437220	5439220	building up your energy, building up your endurance,
5439220	5440660	even if it's minute.
5440660	5444140	That is a good step into the next level of exercise.
5444140	5448060	See, unlike a lot of my friends since I live in LA, I
5448060	5450500	like to indulge in this activity on occasion.
5450500	5452820	It's called eating.
5452820	5457660	And actually, I'm actually completely pro on the idea of
5457660	5458340	working out with this.
5458340	5460420	Because quite frankly, it's not.
5460420	5462460	I mean, I completely agree with Chris.
5462460	5463660	It's good to get out of the house, et cetera.
5463660	5465660	No, I'm in complete agreement on that.
5465660	5466340	I agree with that, too.
5466340	5468940	But sometimes going to the gym sucks.
5468940	5471620	Let's face it, people go there to meet other people.
5471620	5473260	People are checking each other out.
5473260	5476100	And when I go in there and my fat ass, I am not interested
5476100	5477340	in that, I do want to get a workout.
5477340	5479660	And if I can do it at home and not be bored out of my brain
5479660	5482740	because the StairMaster goes nowhere, I feel like a
5482740	5483540	hamster wheel.
5483540	5485660	I feel like I'm on the hamster wheel of life.
5485660	5487140	That if you get to do a lot of playing games, great.
5487140	5490060	You pay $50 and you go up.
5490060	5491380	Dennis Leary for the win.
5491380	5492900	Yes, Dennis Leary.
5492900	5493740	Life sucks.
5493740	5495300	Get a helmet.
5495300	5497740	Yay, I'm sorry.
5497740	5502140	Another thing, though, is you know, and this is what I'm
5502140	5504140	going to do for my, because I used to be an utter gym
5504140	5507220	junkie before I developed chronic fatigue syndrome
5507220	5509500	because I was going to the gym five days a week.
5509500	5512540	I dropped something like 85 pounds in two and a half
5512540	5515460	years, which I hate you for.
5515460	5519820	Jamie used to have a few extra pounds, but she's lost it all.
5519820	5521020	She's hot.
5521020	5525460	I don't care saying I went from a size 22 to a size 12 in
5525460	5527060	two and a half years.
5527060	5535140	So I think, you know, going to the gym was good for me
5535140	5537300	because I actually like to lift weights because I like
5537300	5538700	being stronger.
5538700	5541260	But cardio is fucking boring.
5541260	5543900	So I'm actually, now that I have the OK to go back to the
5543900	5546860	gym, I'm actually going to be taking, OK, I've been slightly
5546860	5549260	obsessed with Dancing with the Stars lately after watching
5549260	5550900	Stacey Keebler's Legs.
5550900	5552540	So I'm going to actually take ballroom dancing.
5552540	5553900	You know what they should have?
5553900	5555580	They should have wee yoga.
5555580	5557620	Wee yoga would be amazing.
5557620	5561100	They kind of have something like that on Xbox.
5561100	5563100	And I think there was a version on GameCube.
5563100	5564060	I know there was on PS2.
5564060	5566300	It was that Think Fitness game or whatever.
5566300	5569540	I think it had yoga in it.
5569540	5573700	So that, you know, and I want the entire tardy listeners to
5573700	5577620	know that when I say, yeah, you can fucking go to the gym,
5577620	5580020	this is from experience, OK?
5580020	5581740	You can get off your ass and do it.
5581740	5582900	You just have to want it bad enough.
5582900	5586020	Nothing changes until you want it bad
5586020	5587580	enough to make it change.
5587580	5588220	Thank you, Jamie.
5588220	5591420	But would it be fair to say there's also alternatives?
5591420	5593340	Because we have a lot of folks in the chat saying gyms are
5593340	5595980	expensive or folks don't like the gym environment.
5595980	5598540	Like JB Monn says, gyms in the village in NYC are just big
5598540	5600260	bath houses with exercise equipment.
5600260	5602020	It's called going outside and walking.
5602020	5603060	There's alternatives.
5603060	5606940	And maybe go outside, run, go outside, walk, find a walking
5606940	5609740	buddy, do something to make yourself more fit.
5609740	5612660	But wouldn't this be at least a little baby step in the
5612660	5613540	right direction?
5613540	5614900	Yeah, I granted that.
5614900	5615940	I granted that.
5615940	5618220	I just, it's just people annoy me.
5618220	5620540	And for Ryoma, a special message for you.
5620540	5621780	Fuck your Yankee blue jeans.
5625580	5626140	Yay.
5626140	5628500	Anyway, there's more to that email.
5628500	5628980	There's more to that email.
5628980	5629460	Oh, more?
5629460	5630460	OK, wow.
5630460	5631380	A little bit.
5631380	5633340	We were at the end.
5633340	5634500	Again, I love the show.
5634500	5636580	And thank you so much for the many hours of entertainment
5636580	5638380	and news you have provided everyone.
5638380	5641140	I'm a quote, truck driver, pickup truck, ha ha.
5641140	5643500	And have to drive a little over an hour straight every
5643500	5644460	Saturday and Sunday.
5644460	5646700	So your podcast really helps pass the time.
5646700	5648620	Thanks again, and best wishes.
5648620	5652140	And it also says, let's have T rates as low as 4.65%.
5652140	5657140	Refinance $150,000 loan for $579 a month.
5657140	5658500	Amazing.
5658500	5660660	And you want to know what's funny?
5660660	5665380	Since I work in the mortgage industry, that actually isn't
5665380	5667740	really all that great in you unless you have an
5667740	5669020	interest-only loan.
5669020	5670940	Isn't that some ad that goes on the bottom of the email
5670940	5672300	automatically?
5672300	5673420	I think it's hilarious.
5673420	5675580	I work in the mortgage industry, so whenever I see
5675580	5677700	those things, I go, oh, that's shitty.
5677700	5680060	Because I know how to read loan documents.
5680060	5681300	It actually is another language.
5681300	5683740	Too bad this isn't a banking show.
5683740	5687460	Yeah, but I have tomorrow off, so suck it.
5687460	5688540	No, you suck it.
5688540	5690140	I have to work tomorrow.
5690140	5691620	Suck it twice, ha.
5691620	5693100	Suck it infinity.
5693100	5694660	Oh, yeah?
5694660	5695340	Oh, yes.
5695340	5699780	Well, you can eat a hairy clam.
5699780	5702420	Did she tell me to eat a hairy clit on?
5702420	5704020	Is that what?
5704020	5706340	She said a hairy clam.
5706340	5708580	Polish my pearl, Rob.
5708580	5709580	Fucking gross.
5709580	5716260	This show just got rated AO.
5716260	5717980	I can't believe.
5717980	5720180	I think in like, what is this?
5720180	5720860	Episode 220?
5720860	5723140	In 220 episodes of Orange House Radio, that was a
5723140	5726820	phallus thing that bitch has ever said to me.
5726820	5729580	I had the top Irene's crusty shit.
5729580	5730180	Oh, OK.
5730180	5731220	No, no, Rob.
5731220	5733620	Remember, you are a douchebag.
5733620	5736940	Yes, Rob, is the official douchebag of Orange House.
5736940	5740900	Why are you bringing up like five-year-old drama of a guy
5740900	5742580	that drives me nuts?
5742580	5744340	There's this guy who drives me.
5744340	5746060	Oh, it's like Neil's on a chalkboard.
5746060	5747820	No, no, no, I'm not going to say it, because I know I'm not
5747820	5748900	going to give attention.
5748900	5750220	I will say it.
5750220	5753860	He works for a major gaming blog now, and I'm just like,
5753860	5756620	oh, this guy's annoying.
5756620	5759060	Yeah, he called me a douchebag once at a DDR tournament, and
5759060	5761260	in my response, I was like, because Irene was with me, I
5761260	5763900	was like, oh my god, Irene, I'm vinegar and water.
5763900	5766820	Did you hear that?
5766820	5767940	You're clean.
5767940	5769620	Yes, at least I'm clean.
5769620	5770940	Cut your hair.
5770940	5773220	All right, anyway, that's it.
5773220	5774620	I don't want to get into drama, because I
5774620	5776540	really don't care.
5776540	5777740	I'm at least years old.
5777740	5779180	I don't even know why this person didn't
5779180	5780980	like me, to be honest.
5780980	5782260	Because he's fabulous.
5782260	5784140	I mean, I know why I don't like him, because
5784140	5784900	he didn't like me.
5784900	5786420	It's like, you started it.
5786420	5788940	He has an electrocuted corncob, but yes, it has this.
5788940	5792260	But just so tight that any time they pull it out, it bleeds.
5792260	5794220	All right, anyhow, can we please change the subject?
5794220	5795140	I don't want to talk about it.
5795140	5796460	I was just trying to talk about it.
5796460	5797780	The years old drama.
5797780	5801220	All right, somebody, please, anybody.
5801220	5802380	Oh, was that the end of the mailbag?
5802380	5803820	Yes, I told you.
5803820	5807020	Let's close the mailbag and get back into the news, please.
5807020	5808420	I blame Chris and Marissa for making me
5808420	5809540	a Tiger Clawed
5809540	5810780	That's all right.
5810780	5814140	Anyways, Tiger Clawed is not Gaming Steve.
5814140	5815980	That's Scott's issue.
5815980	5817900	I don't even know Gaming Steve.
5817900	5820300	Anyways, so speaking of idiotic, there's
5820300	5822820	a brand new channel added to the Wii this week called
5822820	5827940	Everybody Votes, which is not true, because not everybody
5827940	5828860	does vote.
5828860	5829660	They should.
5829660	5832620	You should be locked out for, yeah, anyways.
5832620	5835100	So yeah, the Everybody Votes channel,
5835100	5837660	and you get to vote on such wonderful topics like,
5837660	5839780	what's better, dogs or cats?
5839780	5841620	Woo-hoo.
5841620	5842940	Yay, that's fun.
5842940	5847140	Worth my Wii to be flashing, by the way,
5847140	5850060	and it's still flashing, because I have not turned it on
5850060	5851860	since the stupid channel came out.
5851860	5855660	But apparently, you can vote on these,
5855660	5857700	you find out the results, and then it
5857700	5861660	gets logged into your profile to how many you got right
5861660	5862940	versus how many you got wrong.
5862940	5866220	And I guess you can show people your Wii penis.
5866220	5868500	To be honest, I wish this channel was Everybody Poops,
5868500	5870260	because that would be a lot better.
5870260	5872180	That would be true, but should that
5872180	5875340	be a question, which do you prefer more in the bathroom,
5875340	5878140	one or two?
5878140	5879920	Well, with two, you can read.
5879920	5883460	I mean, one, you're, anyway, this is disgusting.
5883460	5885700	I actually think the channel is really cute.
5885700	5887060	I didn't have a problem with it.
5887060	5889940	I think it's, you know, it's not,
5889940	5893100	like, it's the perfect kind of, Nintendo did not
5893100	5894500	make any fanfare out of it.
5894500	5897340	This is probably just something that used to be a tech demo.
5897340	5899740	I mean, we're going to be seeing a lot of crap like this,
5899740	5901860	but Nintendo did not try to sell this to anyone.
5901860	5903620	They did not try to put it out, like, by the Wii,
5903620	5904500	because we had the Everyone Votes channel.
5904500	5906420	No, it's just like, hey, we're just
5906420	5908100	going to put this up because we're bored.
5908100	5909620	We're going to put up this Everyone Votes channel
5909620	5911420	just because we have it, and here it is.
5911420	5913660	And it reminds me of this old-ass game,
5913660	5915120	and I can't even remember what the name of the game is.
5915120	5916900	I hope somebody in chat remembers.
5916900	5919020	But it was by the people that did Acrophobia,
5919020	5919780	if you remember that game.
5919780	5920980	It was, like, a game show type thing
5920980	5922280	you could play on the computer.
5922280	5924940	And there was one that, like, had a game where
5924940	5926700	you were playing with, like, 50 other people,
5926700	5927660	and there were polls.
5927660	5929580	And you tried to guess how everybody else would answer,
5929580	5931180	and you moved up this little pyramid,
5931180	5933060	depending on how accurate you were.
5933060	5934340	This really reminds me of that.
5934340	5938900	It's not a game, per se, but it has tracked your predictions.
5938900	5941900	And when I did the Dogs and Cats,
5941900	5944500	I actually thought worldwide, because it's a worldwide catch
5944500	5946340	on, I thought cats would be more popular.
5946340	5947100	And I was wrong.
5947100	5949260	And when the results came in, I was like, oh, I
5949260	5950060	can't believe it.
5950060	5951600	And I was like, oh, I kind of just
5951600	5954380	got emotional over a video game, a stupid little thing.
5954380	5956920	So I mean, it was a little thrill, and it's free.
5956920	5958380	So I don't think it's a bad thing.
5958380	5960740	I think it's cute.
5960740	5962180	There are any kittens left because
5962180	5963300	of all the masturbating.
5963300	5965260	That's why.
5965260	5967780	I see.
5967780	5969060	All right, well, there you go.
5969060	5971580	Did anybody else try the voting channel?
5971580	5973540	I watched Extra for Do It last night.
5973540	5974040	Was it?
5974040	5975540	It was hot.
5975540	5976500	Was it cute, though?
5976500	5977980	I thought the channel was cute.
5977980	5982020	I hate the entire world because cats are more awesome.
5982020	5984780	Actually, I believe it was Switzerland
5984780	5986700	where cats outrank dogs.
5986700	5988500	So let's all move to Switzerland.
5988500	5990260	We have a Norway listener in chat tonight.
5990260	5992300	I love our Norwegian listener.
5992300	5997060	So Olaf, we need to get Olaf a cat, Olaf the Viking a cat.
5997060	6000740	I want pictures of, never mind, that's a Dr. Who reference.
6000740	6002180	Anyhow, sorry.
6002180	6006860	All right, so go vote if you want on your Wii right now.
6006860	6009220	Another thing you can do on your Wii right now is download
6009220	6012580	Kid Icarus, but you should know that some of the codes
6012580	6015260	that you may remember from your childhood, they don't work.
6015260	6019020	If you want to put in Icarus Fights Medusa Angels,
6019020	6020700	that code is not going to work.
6020700	6022500	There is a warning before you download it.
6022500	6024980	It says the original Kid Icarus allows players
6024980	6026140	to use secret passwords.
6026140	6028300	However, Virtual Console does not support these passwords.
6028300	6030300	And at first, I thought that meant passwords
6030300	6031500	weren't going to work at all.
6031500	6032740	And that's not true.
6032740	6037940	You still can use the old little jumble 0080C whatever type
6037940	6039120	passwords.
6039120	6041980	It's just the secret ones won't work because apparently
6041980	6045380	the original cartridge had an included module in it
6045380	6046820	to process the special codes.
6046820	6048820	I never realized that.
6048820	6052740	But don't the emulators emulate those codes?
6052740	6054700	So that seems so weird to me.
6054700	6057780	Like if you play this on Nesticle or whatever
6057780	6063580	those NES emulators are you use, can't you use those codes?
6063580	6064180	Yeah.
6064180	6067620	So I don't get it.
6067620	6068820	Because they're lazy?
6068820	6070900	Well, I don't know enough about hardware, I guess.
6070900	6073340	Because they're too busy working on everybody votes to,
6073340	6076060	I don't know, fix their Virtual Console stuff?
6076060	6079300	I don't think everybody votes was already done
6079300	6083020	in some capacity, I think, as some type of demonstration.
6083020	6083780	It's not that.
6083780	6088580	I'm talking about this thing here.
6088580	6090180	But really, maybe it was just done
6090180	6092500	so that people would have to see how fucking hard Kid
6092500	6093980	Icarus really was.
6093980	6095580	Because I think a lot of y'all forgot.
6095580	6097740	Because you used to use those passwords to just beat
6097740	6098260	the game.
6098260	6100100	But Kid Icarus is fucking hard.
6100100	6101540	It is, but it's awesome.
6101540	6102060	It is.
6102060	6103540	It's definitely worth your time.
6103540	6104060	I love that game.
6104060	6104940	It's worth $5.
6104940	6106300	She's going to be in the middle.
6106300	6108020	You'll never get a sequel.
6108020	6109780	Never.
6109780	6112540	Fuck you, I hate you.
6112540	6115620	Well, speaking of the Virtual Console,
6115620	6117380	we do actually have some other news.
6117380	6120020	There's a few of the Japan only games
6120020	6123220	that are going to be coming onto the US Virtual Console.
6123220	6126420	It's pretty cool.
6126420	6128380	It's actually with a conversation
6128380	6132420	with Nintendo of America senior VP, George Harrison.
6132420	6135380	They are looking into bringing some of the more successful
6135380	6139740	Japanese franchises that have that cult following in the US
6139740	6141180	on the Virtual Console.
6141180	6144900	Basically, those of us who are the niche gamers, they love us.
6144900	6147060	Nintendo loves us.
6147060	6148220	That's proof.
6148220	6150380	So they're talking about bringing over
6150380	6153180	some of the games if they can have them translated properly.
6153180	6154980	I'm sorry, but if they really loved us,
6154980	6157180	they would have made the fucking thing region free.
6157180	6158340	True.
6158340	6161980	However, they still haven't given me Guardian Legend.
6161980	6163660	Bastards.
6163660	6165420	Guardian Legend is that game we will always
6165420	6167700	bitch about that we will never get on Virtual Console.
6167700	6169980	Guardian Legend is the actually.
6169980	6171260	Greatest 8-bit game ever made.
6171260	6172460	That's all that needs to be said.
6172460	6172940	Indeed.
6172940	6176420	And then it's followed by the greatest 16-bit game ever made.
6176420	6178220	Rondo of Blood.
6178220	6180660	Now, I think about wasn't the MSX announced
6180660	6182940	as one of the systems they were going to emulate in Japan
6182940	6183740	on Virtual Console?
6183740	6184460	I do believe so.
6184460	6187220	Because if we get an MSX emulator on here,
6187220	6188700	do you know what that means we get?
6188700	6190540	Metal fucking gear.
6190540	6192980	The real sequel to Metal Gear 2?
6192980	6195980	Dude, that's it right there.
6195980	6196940	That's what I want.
6196940	6199820	You write that right under Guardian Legend on the wishlist.
6199820	6202180	On MSX, there were two Guardian Legend games.
6202180	6204700	That would be on the same list of, yeah, sure.
6204700	6208780	We'll implement online before we implement this shit.
6208780	6209740	Fuck you, I hate you.
6209740	6212340	But on the MSX, there actually were two Guardian Legend games.
6212340	6214380	It's called Guardia.
6214380	6215380	I've heard of Guardia.
6215380	6218100	I've never played it, but that would be hot.
6218100	6219300	I would settle for Guardia.
6219300	6223940	I had a photograph of it once that my MSX emulator
6223940	6225420	wouldn't run, so I was so upset.
6228500	6231340	And I'm sure that everyone's going to be, well,
6231340	6233940	I don't know if anyone's really going to be interested in this,
6233940	6236100	but apparently they're putting out Brunswick Pro
6236100	6241300	Bowling for Nintendo Wii, the PlayStation 2, and PSP.
6241300	6248180	Honestly, ask yourself, when ever, ever,
6248180	6250100	other than Wii Bowling, has there ever
6250100	6253260	been a good bowling game on any console?
6253260	6255300	You just said it, Wii Bowling.
6255300	6256580	Other than Wii Bowling.
6256580	6258500	The Tekken bowling game on Tekken.
6258500	6260540	Oh, shush.
6260540	6262060	It was fun.
6262060	6263220	For three seconds.
6263220	6266900	Can I be really lame and not console oriented
6266900	6270020	and say that elf bowling was awesome?
6270020	6271300	Whee!
6271300	6275700	How about, what's the one they had at the Metreon years ago,
6275700	6277780	Mega Bowling, or whatever that thing was for you?
6277780	6280020	Touch Bowling, the one with the, no, that wasn't at the Metreon.
6280020	6281140	This was the giant ball.
6281140	6282260	Dave & Busters has it, too.
6282260	6283980	Dave & Busters, with the giant screen.
6283980	6284860	Ahead of the Metron, too.
6284860	6286700	I remember this, because we played it there.
6286700	6290500	And Neo Geo Bowling, Ryoma says, and Clubhouse Games.
6290500	6292900	But because everybody loves Wii Bowling,
6292900	6295140	somebody said, let's turn this into an actual full-fledged
6295140	6295540	game.
6295540	6296340	Yeah, that's great.
6296340	6298460	Let's charge something that you can get, I don't know,
6298460	6298960	for free.
6298960	6300940	There's a pinball game called 9 Pin.
6300940	6302620	Well, let's just make another game that's
6302620	6306060	exactly the same as the last one and charge you money for it.
6306060	6308300	That's OK, because it's Brunswick Pro Bowling.
6308300	6311060	And I'm sure, to be honest, though, when it does come out,
6311060	6315500	it'd be like $20, so who gives a shit?
6315500	6317180	I mean, it's going to be cheap.
6317180	6320260	I mean, God crave.
6320260	6322820	I mean, I don't know.
6322820	6327820	The last, what was it, the last, they had some, I want to say,
6327820	6331180	Extreme Bowling 2006 that came out last year.
6331180	6333460	It was uber lame, by the way.
6333460	6340300	So hopefully, they will go with the same kind of gameplay
6340300	6343660	as Wii Bowling, but somehow, I think
6343660	6346780	they're going to fuck it up, because they always fuck it up.
6346780	6347620	Comments from chat.
6347620	6350460	James Patrick says, Elf Bowling, shooter.
6350460	6356260	DJ Jenai says, Elf Bowling, it's more fun if you're drunk.
6356260	6358700	DJ Dark Knight says, Simpson Bowling.
6358700	6361660	Alpha Canagram agrees, Tekken Bowling.
6361660	6363700	Gaming Nerd says, let's throw our Wiimotes directly
6363700	6364900	into our TVs and break them.
6364900	6368020	Oops, I thought I was holding a bowling ball.
6368020	6371780	At Def says, what I do want is a new baseball game for the Wii.
6371780	6375740	And Tiger Claw remembers, guys, what about Hyper Bowling?
6375740	6377860	It came with Microsoft Plus for the XP.
6377860	6378660	That's what it was.
6378660	6380100	It was called Hyper Bowling, but you actually
6380100	6381940	had a bowling ball, because that was the version of it
6381940	6383100	that they had in the arcades.
6383100	6385060	It was Hyper Bowling, but with an actual ball that you roll.
6385060	6386140	Anyway, forget it.
6386140	6390140	But I was excited that Tiger Claw reminded me
6390140	6392940	of the name of that.
6392940	6394380	Is that it, or any more stories?
6394380	6395420	Oh, next story is mine.
6395420	6397140	Whoops, my bad.
6397140	6398620	Ha ha, fail.
6398620	6401220	And it has to do with one of my very favorite countries,
6401220	6403300	the only other country I've really been to.
6403300	6403980	I can remember.
6403980	6405260	I went to the Caribbean when I was seven,
6405260	6406180	but that doesn't count.
6406180	6408420	So the only other country I've really been to is Canada.
6408420	6413780	And Canada, even though we have a lot of Canadian listeners,
6413780	6416300	things are kind of quiet gaming-wise in Canada.
6416300	6418860	I mean, sure, you got some of the game studios in Toronto,
6418860	6420940	Vancouver, but for the most part,
6420940	6423240	you don't hear a whole lot of big gaming news coming out
6423240	6423740	of Canada.
6423740	6424620	Well, now guess what?
6424620	6427860	ESA has their sights set on Canada,
6427860	6431340	because apparently Canada has pirates galore.
6433900	6436780	I think they're confusing pirates
6436780	6438660	with maple syrup or hockey.
6438660	6442540	A coalition of American media industry trade groups
6442540	6444860	is asking the US government to say
6444860	6448180	that Canada is on the list of the world's worst countries
6448180	6450220	when it comes to enforcing intellectual property
6450220	6452460	rights and fighting piracy.
6452460	6455060	This was from the seven-member IIPA,
6455060	6457480	International Intellectual Property Alliance.
6457480	6458940	And they're saying that Canada has
6458940	6461880	failed to deliver on promises of more stringent copyright laws
6461880	6464940	and stepped up enforcements for laws already on the books.
6464940	6468380	Quote, Canada remains far behind virtually all of its peers
6468380	6470680	in the industrialized world with respect to its efforts
6470680	6472480	to bring its copyright laws up to date
6472480	6475500	with the realities of the global digital networked environment.
6475500	6477560	Indeed, even the major developing countries
6477560	6479740	have progressed further and faster than Canada
6479740	6481180	in meeting the challenge.
6481180	6484900	Insert mandatory playing Canada joke here.
6484900	6487880	Hey, I just have a personal experience.
6487880	6489820	All my Canadian friends love Warcraft,
6489820	6491700	but then again, who doesn't, and pot,
6491700	6497660	and preferably at the same time, which really confused me.
6497660	6502020	So what does a Canadian pirate look like?
6502020	6504540	I don't know.
6504540	6506460	Jack Sparrow that kind of smells like maple?
6506460	6507300	I don't know.
6507300	6510420	No, I have this image of like a bobsled that looks like a ship
6510420	6513140	with a sail on it and dogs.
6513140	6514940	Are mush.
6514940	6515980	No.
6515980	6518660	I'm going to Canada later this year.
6518660	6519220	That's good.
6519220	6520140	Canada is a fun place.
6520140	6523980	And I'm going to find me a Canadian pirate.
6523980	6525740	Maybe he'll find your booty.
6531260	6534340	What the fuck is a ferret?
6534340	6535340	It's a ferret joke.
6535340	6536820	Look, a ferret's been absorbed.
6536820	6537980	I'll hit myself with Kirby.
6537980	6538660	There you have me.
6538660	6539780	Isn't that DNL's Kirby?
6539780	6540740	It's DNL's Kirby.
6540740	6541740	She needs to come get it.
6541740	6542740	DNL, you need to come get your Kirby.
6542740	6544900	Because I'm getting my cooby cootie coobies.
6544900	6548180	I'm getting my cooties all over this Kirby that DMN brought.
6548180	6548740	On my nipple.
6548740	6549340	Look at that.
6549340	6550900	There you go.
6550900	6552380	Just for you, Renee.
6552380	6554260	He's sexing it up for you.
6554260	6557460	Well, I have some uses better than blaming Canada for shit.
6557460	6558060	What's that?
6558060	6560180	Well, actually, it's not really all that exciting.
6560180	6563180	But DirecTV has something called Game Lounge now.
6563180	6566340	And it's this interactive channel for family stuff
6566340	6568380	that you'd get played through your satellite box.
6568380	6571460	So it's like Xbox Live suck edition.
6571460	6576260	It has games that are based on kid shows like SpongeBob.
6576260	6580140	And it has competitive games where you can compete
6580140	6582380	for prizes and money.
6582380	6584700	And you should check it out, I guess,
6584700	6588340	if you are into family games.
6588340	6590220	I like for my games to have blood and sex.
6590220	6591700	Gaming Lounge?
6591700	6592820	It's called Game Lounge.
6592820	6593340	Game Lounge.
6593340	6595620	Was Orange Lounge taken?
6595620	6596860	Oh, I guess it was.
6596860	6598900	Didn't we contemplate changing the name of the show
6598900	6600100	to Game Lounge at one point?
6600100	6600620	No.
6600620	6604300	Because I thought we did.
6604300	6605820	Then maybe I'd put that, because we
6605820	6607260	were having those problems with nobody
6607260	6609220	understands that Orange Lounge Radio is a gaming
6609220	6611640	show, because people don't get the Orange Lounge reference
6611640	6612980	with DDR and Bimani.
6612980	6615700	But that's why this year was me.
6615700	6616540	You know what, Rob?
6616540	6617940	We did have a conversation on that one.
6617940	6620020	You said, hey, what if we change our name to Game Lounge?
6620020	6620780	And we both went, no.
6620780	6621460	Yeah, exactly.
6621460	6622260	Just like that.
6622260	6623620	Yeah, it was just like that.
6623620	6628380	This was a dramatic recreation.
6628380	6630340	Hey, guys, I have this really great idea.
6630340	6632100	No.
6632100	6632660	That was it.
6632660	6634020	That was it right there.
6634020	6637540	That was the recreation.
6637540	6641380	Just shot down again by Jamie.
6641380	6642100	Rob?
6642100	6642580	What?
6642580	6644300	Heart.
6644300	6647260	All right.
6647260	6651260	Anyhow, we've gone very long, this statement,
6651260	6652540	almost two hours.
6652540	6654700	Marissa, can you believe this show is only half over?
6657500	6660860	If this is torture, then chain me to the wall.
6660860	6662940	But the listeners like it when it's long.
6662940	6666660	I bet you guys like it long, don't you?
6666660	6668060	You like it long.
