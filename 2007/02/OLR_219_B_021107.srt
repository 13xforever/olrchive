00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:26,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame you.

00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,162
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is going to rescue us with some gaming news.

15
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:29,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to.

16
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:30,662
[SPEAKER_07]: You must.

17
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:31,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Help.

18
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:33,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how about this?

19
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:34,183
[SPEAKER_02]: It's movie news.

20
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:35,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that works.

21
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:38,445
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as it's not Uwe Boll.

22
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:39,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

23
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's going to be one of those shows tonight.

24
00:01:43,926 --> 00:01:44,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

25
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:45,267
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

26
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:45,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

27
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:46,847
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

28
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:48,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

29
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:51,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.

30
00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:53,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, my show now.

31
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're listening to Jamie Lounge Radio.

32
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:56,175
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

33
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:57,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that?

34
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,876
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the sound of a thousand people unsubscribing.

35
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:00,316
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

36
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:00,996
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

37
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:03,477
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the sound of my finger raised in tribute to you.

38
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:04,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Video game news.

39
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:05,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we ever do it on this program?

40
00:02:05,738 --> 00:02:08,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony is making a Metal Gear movie.

41
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Produced by, was it the one who's producing the Ghost Rider movie?

42
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:16,647
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very cool stuff.

43
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:22,210
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was actually announced by Studio Kojima at last E3.

44
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:38,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, as far as what's been quoted, is that it's going to be a very... Okay, this makes no sense.

45
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:44,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're talking about...

46
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, whatever.

47
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:46,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make me feel worse.

48
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:47,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

49
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:18,403
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm actually voting for the write-in sequel.

50
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:20,785
[SPEAKER_07]: The write-in sequel?

51
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:21,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

52
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:22,686
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

53
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:23,787
[SPEAKER_07]: UFO ending?

54
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:24,107
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

55
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:26,149
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

56
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Dog ending?

57
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:32,054
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's the Silent Hill movie, not Metal Gear.

58
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:39,780
[SPEAKER_12]: So does that mean we're going to speculate about who's going to be playing all of the roles in the movie?

59
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:47,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Garsh, Rice Princess, if you were to cast the Metal Gear Solid movie, who would you cast in the role of Snake?

60
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:49,853
[SPEAKER_12]: A snake?

61
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:58,738
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I would cast, um... Dude, why can I not be... Matt Damon, because he plays everybody.

62
00:03:58,938 --> 00:03:59,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Ben Affleck.

63
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:00,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt Damon!

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben Affleck, because apparently people think that he's such a universal actor that he can play any role ever.

65
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:08,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

66
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:11,486
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know who I want it to be.

67
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:13,246
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy who's his voice actor.

68
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:14,567
[SPEAKER_07]: David Tennant?

69
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:15,727
[SPEAKER_02]: No, David Hader.

70
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:17,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah.

71
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:21,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, I'm pulling up pictures of him and he's actually really cute.

72
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would actually make a good snake.

73
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,570
[SPEAKER_02]: See, here he is.

74
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:29,312
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as Loki plays... I'm going to send it to the chat room.

75
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,812
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as Loki plays the role of Tingle.

76
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:34,093
[SPEAKER_07]: That's according to GS68.

77
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:36,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, because keep in mind...

78
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:42,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, David Hayter wrote the first two X-Men movies, but he was also Solid Snake's voice actor.

79
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:46,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, he's pretty freaking... He looks kind of like Snake, too.

80
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:48,056
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Janai wins.

81
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,777
[SPEAKER_07]: He says Paul Reubens should play Snake.

82
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:58,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, apparently it's a Hollywood reporter saying that Columbia Pictures is now currently negotiating the rights to Metal Gear Solid.

83
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbia is owned by Sony, so not a big surprise there.

84
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:04,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

85
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:14,360
[SPEAKER_05]: What is kind of a big surprise though is Rockstar's brand new game Manhunt 2 is coming to the Wii as well as PlayStation 2 and PSP.

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:33,026
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who didn't play Manhunt 1, in Manhunt you actually play a psychopathic killer who is basically egged on to kill people in very violent ways using everything from trash bags to shards of glass and

87
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:37,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess we will actually get a murder simulator.

88
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:37,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

89
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:40,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is awesome, and it's going to be very violent.

90
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:42,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, so you can use a trash bag to kill someone?

91
00:05:42,655 --> 00:05:46,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and it's great because you can use... Let's demonstrate in studio how that's done.

92
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Irene, if you would just sit still for a minute.

93
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:53,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

94
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:56,578
[SPEAKER_07]: We here at Orange Launch Radio do not endorse the actual killing of actual people.

95
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:59,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, this got announced on February 6th.

96
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:17,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Which just so happened, ironically enough, and I'm sure this is just pure coincidence, happened to be the anniversary of apparently a murder that was sought to be blamed on the original Manhunt game, apparently.

97
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:25,986
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a 2004 incident where a kid, Steven, I don't even...

98
00:06:26,513 --> 00:06:31,094
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, age 14, was murdered by his friend, Warren LeBlanc, age 17.

99
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:38,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, they blamed the actions on the game, which was later disproved in court.

100
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:43,336
[SPEAKER_05]: But parents, either way, are still kind of pissed off that they made this announcement on the anniversary of that.

101
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:45,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

102
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:46,936
[SPEAKER_05]: More murder game!

103
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:47,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this.

104
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And fuck those parents.

105
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:51,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Those parents are just jealous that they didn't make it first.

106
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:52,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know what?

107
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:54,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Manhunt 2, hell yes.

108
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:55,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

109
00:06:56,861 --> 00:07:21,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize if I mispronounce this name Kai Hate Wireless says Manhunt 2 will get Wii recalls at Walmarts and Targets nationwide Mike W says murder games suck Raven's Dolphin says Manhunt for the Wii for the win FTW well we shall see is Manhunt 2 a game that interests you?

110
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:32,395
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, because you said earlier in the program you want games with more blood and more violence, and I don't know, killing people with a trash bag with your Wiimote, that's... I think that that would be a very interesting... Is that a game that appeals to women?

111
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:36,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it should be Ultimate PMS Revenge, the game.

112
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:39,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

113
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:42,257
[SPEAKER_05]: She just doesn't like the title because it has man in it.

114
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:46,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, because that could also be women taking revenge off of male oppression.

115
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:48,039
[SPEAKER_07]: What if they called it ManCunt?

116
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that appeal to you, then?

117
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,166
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because then I'd start thinking of someone who's pre-op transgendered or something.

118
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:54,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, I just threw up in my mouth.

119
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's switch topics to a Zorro game on the way to the Wii.

120
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:09,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Pronto Games is going to be bringing the destiny of Zorro to the Wii this holiday season.

121
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,736
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was announced by Pronto Games.

122
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:18,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Pronto president and creative director Randy Engel said they hope to bring the player, quote,

123
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Fully into the moment of Zorro-ness.

124
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And this game is currently planned as a Wii exclusive.

125
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:25,673
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, I swear to God, that's a quote.

126
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:27,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Fully into the moment of Zorro-ness.

127
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:28,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, you have killed Irene.

128
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:29,695
[SPEAKER_01]: She is laughing to death.

129
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:30,755
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it says.

130
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,136
[SPEAKER_07]: What would that be, like the 1920s?

131
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:40,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You all know that with that Wiimote, you're going to have to do that stupid make a Z with your Wiimote.

132
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,722
[SPEAKER_07]: How many times in the game do you think you're going to be required to go

133
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's the only point of the game.

134
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:48,330
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what you do.

135
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,373
[SPEAKER_07]: The objective is you try to make the Z. That's the game, and that's how you fully embrace the Zoroness.

136
00:08:55,514 --> 00:09:04,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and at the same time, you can fully embrace the Zeroness for buying the game.

137
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they call him the Gay Blade.

138
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:09,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

139
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:12,983
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ... It's a new Zoro...

140
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,661
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Janai says, Zo, really?

141
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:22,206
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like this, Rob.

142
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:26,990
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's like... Three snaps in Z formation?

143
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Loki just do three snaps in Z formation?

144
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:30,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that he did.

145
00:09:30,993 --> 00:09:33,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Flash, flash, flash with the girl.

146
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:37,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I give this game two snaps, a twist, and a kiss.

147
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,635
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the single gayest show we've ever done.

148
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:48,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so gay that they'll be downloading rainbows.

149
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:56,080
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, if you are listening for the first time and you're like, that's wrong.

150
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to call GLAAD on these people.

151
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of us are gay, so it's okay that we make these jokes.

152
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:03,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Me being one of them, Eddie the gay being the other.

153
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:07,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Casper the gay, Eddie the gay, whatever.

154
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:07,584
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gay.

155
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:08,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Gay the gay.

156
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:13,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Gay, the gayest gay that ever gayed with his gay blade on the Zorro Gay Game.

157
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, DT said I just won the internet.

158
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:15,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for Rob.

159
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, when I ever eat breakfast, I poop out the internet, so don't worry about that.

160
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:22,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you mastered your gay blade?

161
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:27,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob has the gay blade, and he bought it at Disneyland.

162
00:10:29,064 --> 00:10:30,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back to video game news, shall we?

163
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:35,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we lose... Tonight, it's how many subscribers can we lose?

164
00:10:37,147 --> 00:10:38,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of gay, I'm sorry.

165
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:40,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Transformers.

166
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,396
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some news about Transformers?

167
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:48,758
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Transformers game being put out by Activision on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PS2, and PC.

168
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:51,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of Ps trying to say that five times fast.

169
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:02,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we have the PSP and DS versions that are going to be handled by Savage and Vicarious Visions.

170
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:04,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, they're going to be handled by a Savage?

171
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:07,144
[SPEAKER_02]: The Transformers are being handled, you know.

172
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:13,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured if we could have a transforming tape deck, we could have a vibrator Transformer, I don't know.

173
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:18,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will get me to another topic today, because I actually looked at the Transformers movie poster today and about cried.

174
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:22,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's actually being handled by Randy Macho Man Savage.

175
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:24,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes!

176
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:25,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Never do a Transformer!

177
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,571
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awful!

178
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:32,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that he plays, you know that he plays Space Ghost's grandfather?

179
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:32,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes!

180
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:34,912
[SPEAKER_02]: on Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

181
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:38,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll actually be doing the rest of the night as Randy Macho Man Savage.

182
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah!

183
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,054
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, no, Rob.

184
00:11:41,215 --> 00:11:41,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no!

185
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:43,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no!

186
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:45,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Naughty, naughty, cool aide.

187
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:47,637
[SPEAKER_12]: So when are you going to start, Rob?

188
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's awful.

189
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:52,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about Transformers game, huh?

190
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

191
00:11:54,561 --> 00:12:08,894
[SPEAKER_02]: The Transformers game you'll be able to either play as an Autobot or Decepticon, and you would have to master each character's weapon moves, transformations, and you'd have to be able to switch between the vehicle and robot mode.

192
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:14,138
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tear up the world around you, you can smash shit, and you can blow shit up.

193
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes it an awesome game already.

194
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:19,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Traveler's Tales...

195
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:26,188
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I believe that they are the ones releasing it.

196
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,469
[SPEAKER_02]: They also had that Lego Star Wars game.

197
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And also had that stupid Bionicle game as well.

198
00:12:33,932 --> 00:12:35,193
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Lego Star Wars game was fun.

199
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps Lego Transformers?

200
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:44,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but I freaking saw that poster today and wanted to cry again.

201
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:46,679
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am going to see Ghost Rider.

202
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:48,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways...

203
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:55,431
[SPEAKER_05]: So the PSP, they just updated the firmware from 3.10 to 3.11.

204
00:12:56,372 --> 00:13:04,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Adding brand new functionality like a fix to some of the R-Type games and a reset button for the emulator.

205
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:14,987
[SPEAKER_05]: And, well, as you might have guessed, as soon as they got it released out there to the world, it was cracked and broken apart and...

206
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yet another firmware that's been released by Sony and cracked the same day.

207
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:27,225
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hooray, your attempts at foiling homebrew have failed yet again.

208
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:28,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even care.

209
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:30,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you say that this is version 3.1.1?

210
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:30,486
3.1.1.

211
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:39,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that song.

212
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:44,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone cracked our system, down, down.

213
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:47,000
[SPEAKER_07]: They took it down, down, down, down.

214
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:48,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

215
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:50,162
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

216
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:54,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those shows.

217
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:57,828
[SPEAKER_05]: 3-1-1, the last three reviews that we've had on the station.

218
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:02,251
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the show we're submitting to the podcast Emmys, by the way, just so you know.

219
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:06,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote for us on Dig and Podcast Alley.

220
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:08,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And tell them you loved episode 219.

221
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:09,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

222
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:16,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, Will Wheaton.

223
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:17,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Who can save a show?

224
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:18,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Will Wheaton.

225
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:20,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't love Will Wheaton?

226
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, Will Wheaton is awesome.

227
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:28,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Will Wheaton blogged this week on SuicideGirls.com and he was blogging about the arcades.

228
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:30,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I urge you to check this out.

229
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:31,554
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of those reminiscing posts.

230
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:36,097
[SPEAKER_07]: He's talking about how he loves the arcades and he loved the arcades back in the 80s.

231
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:38,898
[SPEAKER_07]: He asked himself, what happens to the arcades?

232
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:44,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And he talks about, well, he thinks that because of PC gaming and I can spend 40 bucks to play a game at home.

233
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you spend a dollar on a game now?

234
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:50,923
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I thought was most interesting about this is his perspective on what should they do.

235
00:14:51,543 --> 00:15:04,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And he thought in the last paragraph of his statement here, he thinks that some billionaire should come out and open a chain of classic 1980 videos arcades, complete with the Journey game and Rush on the Jukebox.

236
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:07,450
[SPEAKER_07]: More reasons why I love Wil Wheaton, by the way.

237
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Love him.

238
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:11,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And that you get five tokens for a dollar.

239
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, and he says, why not?

240
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:19,799
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a resurgence of 50s diners in the 80s, so why not a resurgence of classic 80s arcades in the new millennium?

241
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,479
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

242
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,120
[SPEAKER_07]: If they opened up like a classic 80s arcade, would you go and would you patronize it?

243
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or I could play MAME in my garage.

244
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if they had the Journey game, I wouldn't.

245
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:34,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be camped out in front of the machine all day.

246
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:35,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have the high score.

247
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:36,862
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the Journey game is awesome.

248
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,504
[SPEAKER_02]: The Journey game is awesome.

249
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:39,565
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

250
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:42,627
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where you get to play that is at Classic Gaming Expo.

251
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to have, like, food there, too, though.

252
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:49,512
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have to be, like, old-school Chuck E. Cheese, you know, back... Isn't that kind of what Dave & Buster's is, though?

253
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:50,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of, yeah.

254
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:51,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

255
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,615
[SPEAKER_05]: But Dave & Buster's is way damn expensive.

256
00:15:53,655 --> 00:16:01,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they have just way too many ticket games there that cost way too much to win prizes that are, you know, okay, more expensive, but still they have to spend more money.

257
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:03,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

258
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:05,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I have to set the mood here a little bit.

259
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:09,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, this shit takes me back.

260
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,920
[SPEAKER_07]: To the days of Asteroids and Ms.

261
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Pac-Man.

262
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:21,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine walking into an arcade and you got Journey blasting on the... Man, this takes me back.

263
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:25,847
[SPEAKER_07]: You love this song, you know it.

264
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,608
[SPEAKER_07]: You just don't want to admit it, right, Princess?

265
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:29,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

266
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:33,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've welcomed Will Wheaton's opinion onto the program.

267
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,041
[SPEAKER_07]: How about your opinion?

268
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:39,464
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys send us emails every week to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

269
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:42,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And last week we complained we didn't get enough emails.

270
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:44,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we actually got quite a few more emails this week.

271
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:45,949
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're very proud of the listeners.

272
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:48,270
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope we get more next week.

273
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

274
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:50,752
[SPEAKER_02]: You hope we get more.

275
00:16:50,952 --> 00:16:54,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get Dark Sakura to open up the mailbag and read some emails.

276
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:57,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

277
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Email, email, email.

278
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Checking the email.

279
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:09,385
[SPEAKER_02]: First one comes from Apollo Chan saying, Hey there, DarkSakura.

280
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:10,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's to me.

281
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:10,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

282
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:13,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope all is well with you and the rest of the crew.

283
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:17,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious if you or any of the other members of the OLR crew happen to have a Facebook account.

284
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:23,014
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are not familiar with Facebook, think MySpace except less tacky and more respectable atmosphere.

285
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:27,057
[SPEAKER_02]: It began as a university-only networking site, but now it's open to everyone.

286
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:31,038
[SPEAKER_02]: If you all are not members, I would like to suggest that you at least give it a look.

287
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:34,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's an OLR Facebook group called Orange Jones Radio Fans, the OLR Army.

288
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:39,728
[SPEAKER_02]: That I started a while ago and I just thought it might be good to let you all know in case you weren't aware.

289
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:41,529
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you could better promote it.

290
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Just another vessel for spreading the OLR gospel.

291
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Love, love, love the show.

292
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:48,873
[SPEAKER_02]: You all make me amazingly happy, so keep up the good work and have a great week.

293
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:49,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Apollo.

294
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:49,973
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

295
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:54,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you all will be talking about the 2DX testing in Illinois on next week's show.

296
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that super exciting?

297
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:56,497
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

298
00:17:56,537 --> 00:17:58,598
[SPEAKER_07]: You listened to part A. I'm excited.

299
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,539
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think it's going to...

300
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,562
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

301
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:23,883
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

302
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:50,154
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it's kind of like Myspace without the page customization and all that weird stuff that brings Myspace to a strange level.

303
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:53,215
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I think is really interesting is that you update people of your status.

304
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:58,397
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, for those of you that remember Jonas, aka Explicit, that came onto this program, he's on my friends page.

305
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:01,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And it told me last night, Jonas is out at a party.

306
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:05,059
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, wow, that's amazing that the internet tells me these things.

307
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing what the internet has accomplished.

308
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:13,790
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's awesome that somebody else created this community and that people were already joining it before we even got an email on it.

309
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,011
[SPEAKER_07]: So big hug and kisses to you guys out there.

310
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:21,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Our next email actually comes from, let me see, from Stacy.

311
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:27,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, I've been listening to the Orange Lounge station for about a week now, and I have a question about the playlist.

312
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:32,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that the majority of the songs are from DDR or Beatmania or from other similar games.

313
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:35,733
[SPEAKER_02]: There were very few, very, very few songs that weren't dance, Eurobeat, etc.

314
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:40,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it advertised as a station dedicated to video games when it's so biased toward dance-type games?

315
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:48,817
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I read on the site, I understand that it started out as being a tribute to those kinds of games, but now, aside from the shows, there's very little to distinguish it from the typical dance station.

316
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:52,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this sounds like an attack, it really is, and I'm generally curious about this.

317
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:54,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just haven't filtered out a lot of the old stuff.

318
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:57,974
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the majority of the stuff because they were all there before.

319
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:07,178
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, well, we did do a pretty big reshuffle when we went to MP3 Pro about a year and a half ago, but I think that's what's been high-rated.

320
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:15,723
[SPEAKER_07]: There are other places out there where you can hear just regular gaming music, but I find that a lot of the orchestral gaming music can kind of be like,

321
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:21,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that it's bad or anything, but without the game there, it doesn't make for the most entertaining radio.

322
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:32,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So we try to keep the music that's in our rotation upbeat a little more, but certainly it could use some help in getting the music buffed up with some other picks that are very upbeat.

323
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:34,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So certainly we welcome your suggestions on music we could add to the stream.

324
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:37,184
[SPEAKER_02]: The really bizarre stuff was from me, by the way.

325
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:44,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, though, we still feel justified in calling ourselves radio dedicated to video gaming because of,

326
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Xenia on the ELDDR

327
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:18,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, LLR.

328
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:23,074
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first time writing, and first of all, I want to say that your show is awesome and continue the good work.

329
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:23,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Smiley.

330
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:29,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the reason I am writing is because I have a question on a certain Konami game that has piqued my interest as of late.

331
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:39,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming if Konami's Oz will ever be released in America, I know that the game is about a year and a half old, but I've seen a YouTube video with an English-dubbed French, I think, text version of the game.

332
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:40,969
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

333
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:08,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always wanted to try out pop and music and other 2DX games besides the English one I own.

334
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:08,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.

335
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:09,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

336
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:13,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you can help me out and thank you for taking the time to read this email.

337
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:14,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, your show rules.

338
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:15,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

339
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,742
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really big freaking long run up.

340
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:21,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to poke or anything.

341
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:23,725
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why no one emails us, DarkSakura.

342
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:25,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me when I can take a breath.

343
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:27,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Oz on PlayStation 2 is not going to come out in this country.

344
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:33,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think there's a lot that can be done at this point because PlayStation 2 is slowly being phased out.

345
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,600
[SPEAKER_07]: So unfortunately you're probably going to have to import that one.

346
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:42,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think it's ever a bad idea to certainly petition the game makers for the games you want to see.

347
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Send emails, let them know.

348
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:52,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a company like Konami, they're somewhat out there reading some of the stuff out there on the internet.

349
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:56,225
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not saying you should go on a board and bitch about it, but send emails, they do care.

350
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:59,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And that goes with any gaming company, not just Konami, any gaming company.

351
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them know you want to see it here.

352
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:13,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the next one is actually a link that was sent to us by JeremyTodd1, which I think is actually pretty cool.

353
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:20,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the folks at Xbox Magazine used me's for the staff picture.

354
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:24,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were doing their nod toward Nintendo.

355
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:33,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually is... If you go to gonintendo.com slash wp-content slash photos slash xbox

356
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:36,230
[SPEAKER_02]: M-I-I-O-X-M.JPG

357
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the sudden appearance of me's in the magazine?

358
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:03,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that just furthering that odd affection that Microsoft has for Nintendo right now?

359
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:06,165
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted to recreate pictures of themselves.

360
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:10,731
[SPEAKER_07]: But using your competitors, because essentially Nintendo is still their competitor.

361
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:20,633
[SPEAKER_07]: because even though Microsoft might have somehow embraced this Wii 60, I mean, it's odd because you see, like, Major Nelson says nice things about the Wii in his blog.

362
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:25,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Trixie, I've read her thing on Xbox.com, she said nice things about the Wii one point.

363
00:24:25,274 --> 00:24:30,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's kind of like Microsoft kind of has this professional respect for the Wii, but that doesn't seem to be reciprocated by Nintendo.

364
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:38,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there might be a respect, but Reggie has flat out said, don't buy a 360, buy more Wii games, you know, essentially, in so many words.

365
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:41,200
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just kind of interesting that Microsoft keeps...

366
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,381
[SPEAKER_07]: handing these olive branches over to Nintendo.

367
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, hey, let's fight Sony together.

368
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:50,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.

369
00:24:52,522 --> 00:24:55,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that maybe they're just trying to screw with the consumer's heads.

370
00:24:55,923 --> 00:24:58,984
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 in our chatroom says, come on, Reggie, make love, not war.

371
00:25:00,204 --> 00:25:02,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about the next email, huh?

372
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:03,344
[SPEAKER_07]: How about it?

373
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:10,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear OLR, hi guys, DDR Dollar Bill here, and probably changing my name in the future, long story.

374
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:13,604
[SPEAKER_02]: and Spirit as long as I'm not going to be in the chatroom on Sunday.

375
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:18,005
[SPEAKER_02]: My crazy self is in Vegas doing some partying with my family and probably a few hundred crazies.

376
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:18,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky.

377
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,306
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have one thing I'd like to ask.

378
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:26,647
[SPEAKER_02]: While I was making my pre-reserve for DDR Universe, I had a glance at the future release's date list.

379
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:28,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Even took home a copy.

380
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:29,787
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps knowing friends at GameStop.

381
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:31,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And so did Guitar Hero 2.

382
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:38,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know this is most likely will be a port of the PS2, but we had a discussion about the rumor of Guitar Hero having a future release of all 80 songs.

383
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,389
[SPEAKER_02]: True or not, it did get me thinking.

384
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:45,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Would having music games concentrate on certain genre make them more appealing to the mass market?

385
00:25:45,882 --> 00:25:50,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it also make it more interesting for those already addicted to the games themselves?

386
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:51,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just my thought of the week.

387
00:25:51,744 --> 00:25:53,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, there's my two dollars to the show.

388
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:56,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you all have fun, and it goes to the chatroom buddies as well.

389
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:57,605
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR dollar bill.

390
00:25:57,785 --> 00:25:58,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

391
00:25:59,145 --> 00:26:00,586
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't make them appeal to more people.

392
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:00,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Know why?

393
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems to be working for karaoke revolution.

394
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:03,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Country.

395
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:03,966
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it sucked.

396
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:05,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was pretty cool.

397
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:06,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it, and I don't even like country music.

398
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:08,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awful.

399
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:10,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.

400
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:10,768
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good game.

401
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:16,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, I have a huge distaste for country music.

402
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:27,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say in response to the Guitar Hero 80 songs thing, an emphasis on rumor is that some of the downloadable packs will have some of the Guitar Hero 1 songs in them.

403
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:38,795
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll bet you 10 to 1, you would have an easier time seeing the indie label stuff crossover than you would the major label stuff crossover because they're going to have to re-license and all that stuff.

404
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:40,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they would have to.

405
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:40,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

406
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:07,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought an Xbox 360 some months ago and my roommate bought a Wii at launch.

407
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:17,952
[SPEAKER_02]: We love many of the games on the systems, but I think that it's time I bought myself a good gaming PC to play some games that I've never been able to play before and I have decided to go with Commodore 64.

408
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:19,833
[SPEAKER_07]: You win the internet.

409
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:20,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this?

410
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:21,393
[SPEAKER_07]: You win the internet.

411
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:22,193
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see.

412
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:29,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand you know a bit about that particular machine and I was wondering if there's anything you recommend I look for when going out and buying one.

413
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:30,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Kickstart.

414
00:27:30,237 --> 00:27:31,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure it works.

415
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:37,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there particular cables and things that I need to make sure I get or particular accessories or games that you recommend I look for?

416
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:50,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about how all of the current next-gen consoles offer extra features like media playback and news and weather channels and I realized that the C64 can be used as a musical instrument so it's a good contender for my next game platform.

417
00:27:51,158 --> 00:27:51,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks in advance.

418
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:54,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Regards, WarriorBob.

419
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:56,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, you rock, Warrior Bob.

420
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:00,212
[SPEAKER_07]: You can hook up a Commodore 64 to a television.

421
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:01,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to remember.

422
00:28:01,272 --> 00:28:01,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been so long.

423
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had a monitor.

424
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:06,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I never hooked up the Commodore 64 to a TV, but I seem to remember the hookups were very similar.

425
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:10,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the video component was almost the exact same between the two.

426
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:14,519
[SPEAKER_07]: So you might need some type of special converter, though, to actually hook it up to a television.

427
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys have Commodore 64s?

428
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:18,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought Rice Princess did.

429
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:18,842
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but you know who did?

430
00:28:19,102 --> 00:28:19,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?

431
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:20,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Captain Kirk.

432
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:21,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess.

433
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:22,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

434
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:22,944
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a Commodore 64, right?

435
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:25,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever hooked up to a TV?

436
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,361
No.

437
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:27,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember if there were special cables?

438
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:28,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

439
00:28:29,202 --> 00:28:30,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember either.

440
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:31,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it's been so long.

441
00:28:31,364 --> 00:28:33,025
[SPEAKER_07]: What about games that you remember on the Commodore 64?

442
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:34,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Impossible Mission.

443
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:36,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, Impossible Mission was awesome.

444
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:38,645
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that game, The Last Ninja?

445
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:40,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Revenge of the Ninja or something?

446
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:41,666
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was awesome.

447
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenge of the Ninja was on the Game Boy.

448
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's The Last Ninja is what it was called.

449
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:46,769
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Revenge of the Ninja was on the Sega CD.

450
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:47,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cinematic game.

451
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Lazy Jones was a fun game because it was a bunch of mini games.

452
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:50,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Lode Runner!

453
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:51,972
[SPEAKER_07]: It's better than Fusion Frenzy.

454
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:52,872
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember.

455
00:28:52,912 --> 00:28:56,574
[SPEAKER_12]: We had like missions to Mars or something like that or the Mars Zoggers.

456
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:57,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Pinball Construction Set.

457
00:28:58,135 --> 00:28:59,016
[SPEAKER_07]: That game's awesome too.

458
00:28:59,256 --> 00:29:00,156
[SPEAKER_07]: No, shut up!

459
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:00,837
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome!

460
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not require a special monitor.

461
00:29:03,598 --> 00:29:04,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be plugged into a TV.

462
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,072
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it says on Wikipedia.

463
00:29:08,452 --> 00:29:12,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, though, Kickstart.

464
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:15,277
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the only game I ever played on the Commodore 64.

465
00:29:15,357 --> 00:29:19,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the one with the button and you kick with the little clown and you kick the balloons around the screen?

466
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,882
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a dirt bike racing game.

467
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:22,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to Excitebike.

468
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:22,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Kickman!

469
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:24,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

470
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:25,986
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to Excitebike.

471
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Kickstart.

472
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:28,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta get that game.

473
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:28,768
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

474
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:28,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

475
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:31,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Winter Games, Bard's Tale.

476
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:34,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, GameTap has a lot of Commodore 64 games on it.

477
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to try some out, GameTap has a bunch.

478
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to find the game that I used to play all the time.

479
00:29:39,782 --> 00:29:45,004
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was Bard's Tale, but I tried to look it up and all the ones that I came up with did not look anything.

480
00:29:45,144 --> 00:29:45,624
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that game?

481
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:47,125
[SPEAKER_07]: The Seven Scrolls or whatever that game was?

482
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,907
[SPEAKER_12]: No, all I remember is a miasmal cur from the game.

483
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:52,828
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the only thing that sticks out in my mind.

484
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:55,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck with your Commodore 64 adventures.

485
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,310
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to try GEOS at some point.

486
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:01,511
[SPEAKER_07]: and see the Commodore 64 as a Mac.

487
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:03,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

488
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, the Commodore 64 was awesome.

489
00:30:06,496 --> 00:30:07,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the Commodore 64.

490
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,358
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a picture on Wikipedia.

491
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:15,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Just about any arcade game that was out in the early 80s had a port on the Commodore 64.

492
00:30:15,884 --> 00:30:16,344
[SPEAKER_07]: You name it.

493
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:19,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Donkey Kong, Kongo Bongo, whatever, it's out there.

494
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:20,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And Captain Kirk did have one.

495
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a Star Trek game on the Commodore 64, you smartass.

496
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he had one in Star Trek 2.

497
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:26,533
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

498
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:28,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know what Commodore 64 is.

499
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:34,825
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I would urge all our listeners at some point this week, because there is a website where you can play Commodore 64 games.

500
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:37,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember what the hell it was.

501
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:40,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe somebody in chat remembers.

502
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:44,792
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some site that had nothing but Java, Commodore 64 games.

503
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:46,133
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play a ton of them online.

504
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:52,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I urge everyone to play one Commodore 64 game this week and check out the roots of PC gaming.

505
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,559
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely make it Impossible Missions.

506
00:30:55,276 --> 00:30:59,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so speaking of the Commodore 64, who had a TI-85?

507
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:05,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what they are, but I didn't have one, because we had a Commodore 64, they were better.

508
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a Coleco, I had an Atom.

509
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:10,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you had an Apple II, I'm sorry.

510
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:14,169
[SPEAKER_02]: We had one at my school, and I played a lot of kicks, and that was all I cared about.

511
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:19,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody in our chatroom, Camara, says Lemon64.com.

512
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:22,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen this site, this isn't the same site I use, but it looks like this will work.

513
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you can do this.

514
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:23,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try it.

515
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,771
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that last email?

516
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:25,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:27,992
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes from Cutie Honey.

518
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:31,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got two things to say this time.

519
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:35,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I recall a comment at the end of the Sunday show where Rob said that the show needs more gay people.

520
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:39,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess you can count me as the OO Army's first bisexual pleasure to meet you guys.

521
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:43,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you've been, you're beaten to that from show one.

522
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:45,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

523
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:53,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, on a completely different note, two weeks ago you guys started a discussion about games that have too many sequels and remakes.

524
00:31:53,943 --> 00:31:59,845
[SPEAKER_02]: In chat, I brought up the fact that DDR had many games, and suddenly a ton of people went crazy.

525
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,385
[SPEAKER_02]: A fun kind of crazy, mind you.

526
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:02,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait.

527
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:03,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Bisexual male or female?

528
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:04,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Male.

529
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:05,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Over 18?

530
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:07,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Single?

531
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:08,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he attach a picture?

532
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:09,528
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

533
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:11,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

534
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:15,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I finish the email?

535
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it's Valentine's Day and I'm single.

536
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:21,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Valentine's Day.

537
00:32:21,969 --> 00:32:23,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I'm doing on Valentine's Day?

538
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:24,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Crocheting?

539
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Having my neck adjusted and going to school.

540
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:27,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun.

541
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:29,711
[SPEAKER_02]: How romantic.

542
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:31,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, can I finish reading the email, please?

543
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:32,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you may.

544
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:32,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

545
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:34,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was I?

546
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:34,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

547
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:38,124
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the burning question.

548
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:43,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Konami beats a dead horse by releasing several Ben Mani games each year with only different song lists?

549
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:44,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

550
00:32:45,726 --> 00:32:46,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Blame the orange soda for that.

551
00:32:47,306 --> 00:32:58,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm not helping the situation by buying every PS2 DDR game that gets released, it's kind of annoying to see some new features like Battle Mode added when you have to ask yourself, why didn't they add it last year?

552
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:01,250
[SPEAKER_02]: The cheap rational bastard in me would rather...

553
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:03,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Honey Fresh Honey Fresh

554
00:33:28,826 --> 00:33:33,288
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think the Bomani games coming out very similar every year with different solos.

555
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:34,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, there's new modes.

556
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:40,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually Konami tries to throw something new in it every time, like whether it be the single-player Mission Master or the Hands and Feet or whatever new thing they did.

557
00:33:41,432 --> 00:33:46,754
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would say it's no different than the Madden 06, 07, 08 games that come out, you know?

558
00:33:47,214 --> 00:33:50,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people don't get that, just like some people don't get the DDR games that come out every year.

559
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:57,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just kind of, if you're into that, then you kind of accept that as part of what the games go through each year with the change, so...

560
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I say.

561
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:04,317
[SPEAKER_07]: With the new songs come new step charts and new challenges, you know?

562
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:04,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

563
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:13,180
[SPEAKER_07]: But see, from the other perspective, ask somebody who doesn't play DDR as much as I do, and they probably think, it's stupid, it's the same game every time.

564
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,242
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how some of us, what some of us say about Madden, is that it's roster update 2007.

565
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:22,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, we don't really play those games, so we don't understand.

566
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:23,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I try not to say that.

567
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:24,664
[SPEAKER_07]: If I do, it's injustice.

568
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:30,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, in the beginning with DDR, it used to have a lot of significant changes with each one.

569
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:40,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember with 5th Mix, you had the actual tempo freezes, which was like when you first played, you're like, what the fuck?

570
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,349
[SPEAKER_05]: The song stopped!

571
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:43,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone broke the machine!

572
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it started up again.

573
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,130
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of neat.

574
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:52,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, you had tempo changes in 4th Mix and stuff like that.

575
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:54,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And

576
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a hot gay man?

577
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,191
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

578
00:34:57,251 --> 00:34:58,231
[SPEAKER_05]: No hot gay man?

579
00:34:58,311 --> 00:34:59,412
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the last email.

580
00:34:59,432 --> 00:34:59,892
[SPEAKER_05]: But a cool one!

581
00:34:59,912 --> 00:34:59,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

582
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:25,526
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your Facebook address, Rob?

583
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:27,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have addresses on Facebook.

584
00:35:27,488 --> 00:35:31,131
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to look me up by name, but I use my stage name, Rob Roberts, so it's easy to find me on Facebook.

585
00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:32,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, you should get a Facebook, too.

586
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:33,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of fun.

587
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's all do that.

588
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:35,315
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

589
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:37,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got another one, too.

590
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:37,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this.

591
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:38,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm popular.

592
00:35:39,298 --> 00:35:39,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

593
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:40,999
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

594
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of popular, you know what game is popular out there?

595
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:46,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Gears of War.

596
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everyone's got a big heart on over Gears of War, except for me, because I don't really like the game.

597
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:51,648
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways...

598
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:58,696
[SPEAKER_05]: It did win eight awards at the 10th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

599
00:35:59,196 --> 00:36:01,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And these aren't like achievement points, but, you know, whatever.

600
00:36:02,837 --> 00:36:11,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It did win a bunch of different awards, including Game of the Year, Best Console Game, Best Animation.

601
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

602
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:18,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Among some other ones here.

603
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:21,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Best Outstanding Character Performance of a Male.

604
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:31,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Online Gameplay, Best Visual Engineering, and Action Adventure Game of the Year.

605
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:34,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprise!

606
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:37,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Gears of War wins more awards.

607
00:36:41,773 --> 00:36:42,053
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

608
00:36:42,753 --> 00:36:43,914
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm actually with Loki.

609
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eh, I could care less.

610
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:46,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

611
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Gears of War is a phenomenal game.

612
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:50,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah.

613
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:52,035
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what everybody on the internet says.

614
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:52,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It must be true.

615
00:36:52,615 --> 00:37:07,666
[SPEAKER_05]: When Halo 3 comes out this year, and even if it isn't as good as Gears of War, and, you know, it could be like half-ass, you know, half as good as Gears of War or whatever, people will still be giving this thing awards and getting a big boner over this game because it's Halo.

616
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:09,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

617
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:13,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Gears was okay, but, I mean, just, I don't know.

618
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't give me the boner it gave the rest of the internet, I guess.

619
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:20,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, this might give a lot of sci-fi fans a boner, though.

620
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:22,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie, get your hand away from me.

621
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:33,800
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the Hollywood Reporter, NBC Universal, which is part of Vivendi, they are working on a space combat game.

622
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a sim game.

623
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:40,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Set in the Battlestar Galactica universe.

624
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:42,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking the new one, not the old one.

625
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Galaxy Balactica.

626
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:48,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Digital download for PC and Xbox Live Arcade.

627
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:56,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a tie-in, by the way, with Xbox because there's new Battlestar Galactica gamer picks and themes available for low amounts of Microsoft points.

628
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:59,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the characters going to cry their emo tears?

629
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Battlestar Galactica is a pretty good show.

630
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've ever actually watched it.

631
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,430
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually pretty good.

632
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,891
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Krylons, not the Cylons.

633
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:06,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

634
00:38:06,611 --> 00:38:07,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop being uneducated.

635
00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:10,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it'll be hard for Eddie.

636
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:11,598
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kidding.

637
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:14,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to seeing what this looks like on Xbox Live.

638
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:15,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet it's fun.

639
00:38:15,422 --> 00:38:17,864
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care about Xbox, but on PC it's going to be awesome.

640
00:38:18,344 --> 00:38:22,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have some news that people might care about, but I don't know, not really.

641
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we have friends at Buena Vista Games?

642
00:38:26,812 --> 00:38:34,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least, you know, they've always been really, really great at E3 to work with because when Square says, you can't film that, they're like, here, let me play it while you film it.

643
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but they have renamed themselves.

644
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:42,812
[SPEAKER_02]: They are now called Disney Interactive Studios.

645
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:44,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dissed.

646
00:38:46,253 --> 00:38:46,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha.

647
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:51,034
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're officially now making their Disney affiliation public.

648
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:55,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we see Kingdom Hearts and the Disney Interactive Studios, we get it.

649
00:38:55,916 --> 00:39:02,757
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still doing non-Disney games too, to every extent extra, which is one of them.

650
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:04,658
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are

651
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:08,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, officially Disney-oriented.

652
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like Disney presents the M-rated dinosaur-hunting Turok.

653
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:15,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out later this year.

654
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:16,322
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be interesting.

655
00:39:16,362 --> 00:39:17,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney's Turok.

656
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:19,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if we'll have a theme ride based on that.

657
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:21,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should have a crossover.

658
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:22,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I would so be on that ride.

659
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:26,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Disney owns ABC as well, so we should have a crossover with the characters from Dinosaur.

660
00:39:27,046 --> 00:39:27,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the mama!

661
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:30,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

662
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:32,068
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

663
00:39:33,612 --> 00:39:36,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope there's some TGIF fans out there that get my joke.

664
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:38,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I'm going to look stupid as usual.

665
00:39:40,016 --> 00:39:40,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

666
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give it up for 92, y'all!

667
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,999
[SPEAKER_05]: 92 in the house!

668
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this might make some people happy.

669
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:54,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Square Enix confirms a brand new MMO coming to 360 and Vista and possibly the PlayStation 3.

670
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:59,788
[SPEAKER_05]: But whether it's going to be a sequel to Final Fantasy XI, maybe Final Fantasy XIV, eh?

671
00:39:59,808 --> 00:39:59,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh?

672
00:40:01,343 --> 00:40:02,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XI 2 Final Fantasy XI 2

673
00:40:30,523 --> 00:40:34,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to crap my pants in eager anticipation.

674
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:36,328
[SPEAKER_07]: What if it's Chrono Trigger Online?

675
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:37,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck yeah, I'll play that.

676
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:38,309
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

677
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:39,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah.

678
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,932
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where I'm really going to crap my pants.

679
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:43,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Ew, that's kind of gross.

680
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:44,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait.

681
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:48,837
[SPEAKER_05]: What if it's like Saga Frontier Online?

682
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:50,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Pass.

683
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be the only person playing it.

684
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

685
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:56,343
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, yes, I can farm all the gold.

686
00:40:57,784 --> 00:40:58,385
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

687
00:40:58,785 --> 00:40:59,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, we can move on.

688
00:40:59,426 --> 00:40:59,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

689
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:09,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I would play Final Fantasy XI too, because as much crap as I get Final Fantasy XI now, I did waste two and a half years of my life on it, so there must have been something in that game I saw.

690
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,495
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a good game while it lasted, but I'm in full Final Fantasy XI recovery.

691
00:41:19,742 --> 00:41:20,002
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

692
00:41:20,082 --> 00:41:20,923
[SPEAKER_12]: That's gross.

693
00:41:21,003 --> 00:41:21,123
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

694
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:22,905
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was actually the people.

695
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:26,067
[SPEAKER_12]: The over 18 link shell people I had.

696
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:30,070
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a mighty big link shell here for you.

697
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Uni in our chat room is a self-confessed FFXI whore.

698
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:34,693
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

699
00:41:35,414 --> 00:41:35,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I win.

700
00:41:35,814 --> 00:41:37,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent four years, says Uni.

701
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:39,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel your pain.

702
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:40,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel your pain.

703
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:41,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

704
00:41:41,678 --> 00:41:43,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever spent real money on gold?

705
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:46,642
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the point when I knew I had to quit.

706
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:49,064
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was contemplating spending real money on gold.

707
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I'm sorry, that's just a little bit too... That's why I quit!

708
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:57,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I said, you know what, no, that's actually... Good for you, Rob.

709
00:41:57,675 --> 00:42:04,719
[SPEAKER_07]: The other reason why I quit is because when I was sitting there for an hour literally doing nothing, waiting for a party, I was like, I can't take this anymore.

710
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Waiting for a pretend party in the game?

711
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,302
[SPEAKER_07]: A panty party!

712
00:42:10,742 --> 00:42:11,643
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome!

713
00:42:12,526 --> 00:42:13,647
[SPEAKER_12]: I miss Ragnarok when I could be leveling.

714
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:40,675
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow.

715
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:43,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking real quickly since you mentioned buying gold.

716
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:43,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

717
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:46,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone's favorite site to hate, IGE.com.

718
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:47,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

719
00:42:47,862 --> 00:42:54,909
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually have options where you can purchase gold amounts up to 50 million, or at least gil.

720
00:42:54,929 --> 00:42:56,631
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 million gil.

721
00:42:56,651 --> 00:42:57,611
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 million gil, which is $1,563.50.

722
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:58,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Who the fuck would spend that money?

723
00:42:58,853 --> 00:42:59,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

724
00:43:03,883 --> 00:43:05,043
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's lame.

725
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:05,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, wait a minute.

726
00:43:06,104 --> 00:43:07,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever happened to our donation?

727
00:43:07,264 --> 00:43:08,084
[SPEAKER_07]: We never spent it, huh?

728
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:08,905
I'm just kidding.

729
00:43:08,925 --> 00:43:09,885
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rob?

730
00:43:10,105 --> 00:43:11,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I am policing that, okay?

731
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:14,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to use it to send me to ASIN.

732
00:43:15,267 --> 00:43:16,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, then I'm policing that now.

733
00:43:17,568 --> 00:43:22,649
[SPEAKER_12]: No, she'll be all like, back me donation, please.

734
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:25,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you please tell the back me wool story to our listeners?

735
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:25,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

736
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

737
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:45,530
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if Brad gave it back or not.

738
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,950
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was funny because it's a Chinese farmer.

739
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,511
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the inside joke.

740
00:43:51,131 --> 00:44:00,315
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to understand, now Irene is a hunter character and her pet is, or no, the name of her character is Back Me Wool and the name of the pet is Please.

741
00:44:01,655 --> 00:44:02,875
[SPEAKER_12]: And nobody gets that.

742
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:03,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

743
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:06,897
[SPEAKER_07]: And now our listeners will if they ever play on Ravencrest.

744
00:44:07,017 --> 00:44:07,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

745
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:08,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't play on Ravencrest.

746
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:11,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, har.

747
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:13,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

748
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Trainwreck, Choo Choo

749
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:43,457
[SPEAKER_07]: You probably have read about this on your favorite blog, but I know some folks here in studio have got to share their stuff on this.

750
00:44:43,837 --> 00:44:47,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's legislation out there, of course, looking to get stricter penalties on games.

751
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:50,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, GameStop released an internal memo this week.

752
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:54,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it was a conference call, and managers were told about a new rule.

753
00:44:54,264 --> 00:44:55,385
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new strict policy.

754
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:55,885
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it.

755
00:44:56,525 --> 00:45:03,370
[SPEAKER_07]: If you sell a game, an M-rated game, to an underage customer, you get fired immediately.

756
00:45:03,812 --> 00:45:11,358
[SPEAKER_07]: and if you're the manager of that store, whether you were there or not, you get fired as well for managing such a shitty employee.

757
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:12,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad that Dan quit.

758
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,481
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of this policy?

759
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:17,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's retarded and I'm glad that Dan quit.

760
00:45:19,164 --> 00:45:27,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the manager, I agree that the manager should have better trained the employee, but really it's the employee that should suffer for it.

761
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the manager should be written up.

762
00:45:30,552 --> 00:45:31,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's acceptable.

763
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:33,552
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you going to do?

764
00:45:33,632 --> 00:45:34,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Make me work overtime?

765
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:39,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to sell an M-rated game to a six-year-old and then you're going to get your ass fired.

766
00:45:39,534 --> 00:45:41,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a shit about this job.

767
00:45:41,535 --> 00:45:42,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go get another one.

768
00:45:45,816 --> 00:45:49,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's retarded because there's no actual law that says you have to do that.

769
00:45:49,237 --> 00:45:50,178
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, hey, whatever.

770
00:45:50,198 --> 00:45:51,758
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their store policy, I guess, you know.

771
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Just make sure you follow it.

772
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:55,179
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah.

773
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:56,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

774
00:45:57,065 --> 00:46:08,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember there was a news thing also where people were doing a sting to see who they can get to sell a six-year-old or whatever.

775
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:17,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like that Dateline NBC where they trap people on the internet and get them to come over wearing no pants to meet the 12-year-old girl?

776
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:21,685
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the reporter guy jumps out and says, surprise, I'm from NBC.

777
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:23,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy's like, I'm so embarrassed.

778
00:46:25,405 --> 00:46:26,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadow Next Gen in chat.

779
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:55,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chat Room, for keeping us on track here.

780
00:46:55,415 --> 00:47:02,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.OrangeLondrainer.com ShadowNextGen says, The policy where managers get fired because of what their employees did is fucked up.

781
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:06,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're responsible for training the employees properly.

782
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:12,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And so writing up is not... Yeah, but what if I'm so mad at my manager and I'm going to quit anyway?

783
00:47:12,627 --> 00:47:15,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm going to sell a game to fuck my manager over too.

784
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,570
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of screwed up.

785
00:47:16,971 --> 00:47:19,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope there's a way to dispute the firing or something.

786
00:47:20,453 --> 00:47:21,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest...

787
00:47:21,849 --> 00:47:29,350
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way they're going to get in trouble is if the fucking parent, you know, says, Hey, I didn't know this game had that kind of content in it.

788
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,611
[SPEAKER_05]: If you maybe, you know, if you tell the parent or whatever.

789
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:40,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what if, you know, for example, Billy has, you know, his friend's older brother buy the game for him or something like that.

790
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:45,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, gets into Billy's hands and his parents go, Where the fuck did you get this from?

791
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:47,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, the GameStop people sold it to me.

792
00:47:48,354 --> 00:47:50,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, now people are getting fired because of that.

793
00:47:51,877 --> 00:47:54,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Legend of Zaku makes a very interesting comparison here.

794
00:47:54,898 --> 00:48:03,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, it's only fair, Jamie, just like in Abu Ghraib, where the people who carried out the torture got the hammer, while the folks who ordered it got off scot-free.

795
00:48:04,401 --> 00:48:06,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the Iraq torture thing?

796
00:48:06,422 --> 00:48:11,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the GameStop owners aren't telling them to sell the games.

797
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:15,025
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really... I'm sorry, that's really...

798
00:48:15,951 --> 00:48:17,412
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the strangest comparison.

799
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:19,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, no offense to Zaku, because everyone's going to tell their opinion.

800
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:20,495
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to Zaku.

801
00:48:20,515 --> 00:48:21,235
[SPEAKER_02]: That was stupid.

802
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:22,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

803
00:48:22,616 --> 00:48:23,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

804
00:48:23,397 --> 00:48:26,859
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that even... Oh, yeah.

805
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:28,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to sell this game.

806
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and you're fired.

807
00:48:30,522 --> 00:48:33,144
[SPEAKER_02]: What manager's going to do... That's fucking stupid.

808
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,567
[SPEAKER_02]: God, think before you try to make a witty comparison.

809
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:38,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

810
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but that doesn't work.

811
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

812
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:43,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you should be selling more of those stupid...

813
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:45,249
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

814
00:49:15,214 --> 00:49:16,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, um... Cheers.

815
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say jizz?

816
00:49:19,396 --> 00:49:20,236
[SPEAKER_02]: No, cheers!

817
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant like you said jizz.

818
00:49:22,957 --> 00:49:23,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Jizz.

819
00:49:25,278 --> 00:49:27,959
[SPEAKER_12]: And wait, PC gaming like politically correct gaming?

820
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,140
[SPEAKER_07]: No, like a personal computer.

821
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:37,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, there's a martial arts MMO called Nine Dragons, and the beta is...

822
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:41,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Open in, uh, actually opening in Europe.

823
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:50,906
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that, um, you'll actually be able to play and get double experience until, uh, let's see, actually I'm not finding the date on here is the sad thing.

824
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be actually open right now.

825
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:56,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in fact, you can actually apply for the, okay, here it is.

826
00:49:56,268 --> 00:50:03,390
[SPEAKER_02]: You can apply for the beta over on the website, which is 9dragons.acclaim.com slash welcome.htm.

827
00:50:04,978 --> 00:50:08,322
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can keep on going to the site and check out the demo there.

828
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:13,607
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're doing a double experience push that actually may be over already.

829
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,309
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time I saw this, it was already over.

830
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:18,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, you can try the game.

831
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:23,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I got three more friend requests on Facebook.

832
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:24,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so popular.

833
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, stop gloating.

834
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:27,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm popular.

835
00:50:28,337 --> 00:50:28,857
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

836
00:50:28,877 --> 00:50:29,818
[SPEAKER_07]: The internet is awesome.

837
00:50:29,978 --> 00:50:31,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody can be a winner.

838
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:40,143
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned in Part A, Galactic Civilizations 2 is getting a brand new expansion pack called Dark Avatar.

839
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:43,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually being released early.

840
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:50,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, you can definitely check it out now if you're into that.

841
00:50:50,428 --> 00:50:57,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And it introduces brand new asteroid belts full of resources and unique planets and

842
00:50:58,635 --> 00:50:59,435
[SPEAKER_05]: other fun stuff like that.

843
00:50:59,495 --> 00:51:01,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play civilization, so.

844
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:02,696
[SPEAKER_05]: But it sounds fun.

845
00:51:08,657 --> 00:51:09,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I wasn't listening.

846
00:51:10,017 --> 00:51:12,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie got a text message and was sharing it with everybody.

847
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:14,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it more friends requests?

848
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:16,358
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was not a Facebook friend request.

849
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:17,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I already took care of those.

850
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, Dark Avatar, one week early.

851
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

852
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:24,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

853
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:25,220
[SPEAKER_07]: A heart.

854
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have a hug, Loki?

855
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have a hug?

856
00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:29,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have a hug, Jamie?

857
00:51:30,085 --> 00:51:30,766
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy me dinner.

858
00:51:32,086 --> 00:51:32,426
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

859
00:51:33,246 --> 00:51:33,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll buy you coffee.

860
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:38,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Decaf, because I know you don't drink caffeine this late.

861
00:51:40,108 --> 00:51:40,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And potato pancakes.

862
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:42,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll think about it.

863
00:51:42,289 --> 00:51:43,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I get a hug right now, live on air?

864
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:44,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

865
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:46,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

866
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I know this isn't TV, but here, I'll put the mic.

867
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:52,832
[SPEAKER_07]: When I hug Jamie, I'll put the mic kind of at my chest level, so maybe you can hear her boob.

868
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,248
[SPEAKER_02]: The best PC gaming story of 2007 right here.

869
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:24,470
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

870
00:52:39,164 --> 00:52:42,525
[SPEAKER_07]: But like when the piece of one... I know you remember, Irene, because you're as big of a nerd as me.

871
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:48,068
[SPEAKER_07]: For the folks who may not know, Archon was like chess, but like the pieces would actually do battle with each other when you tried to capture another piece.

872
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:48,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Battle Chess!

873
00:52:48,988 --> 00:52:53,410
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not Battle Chess, because Battle Chess, the animations were already pre-done.

874
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,891
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually had like a real-time fighting thing.

875
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:57,132
[SPEAKER_07]: This game was also on the NES.

876
00:52:57,192 --> 00:52:58,672
[SPEAKER_07]: They ported it to several platforms.

877
00:52:59,213 --> 00:52:59,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Battle Chess.

878
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:01,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Archon is better.

879
00:53:01,654 --> 00:53:02,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was even Archon 2 and 3.

880
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:05,875
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't talk about Archon 2 and 3, because Archon was like the best.

881
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:06,936
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

882
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,532
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

883
00:53:28,476 --> 00:53:31,018
[SPEAKER_07]: That has huge nostalgic value for the right reasons.

884
00:53:31,259 --> 00:53:35,483
[SPEAKER_07]: The gameplay, the great combination of strategic thinking, and the intense arcade action.

885
00:53:35,723 --> 00:53:36,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, seriously?

886
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:42,009
[SPEAKER_07]: If this game comes to Xbox Live Arcade, I will have died from too much orgasm.

887
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:43,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now?

888
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:45,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, seriously.

889
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like... Look at my pants.

890
00:53:48,075 --> 00:53:48,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at my pants.

891
00:53:48,676 --> 00:53:49,176
[SPEAKER_07]: They got bigger.

892
00:53:49,256 --> 00:53:49,737
[SPEAKER_07]: No, please don't.

893
00:53:51,418 --> 00:53:51,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so...

894
00:53:52,591 --> 00:54:01,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Incredibly happy, you don't even know, like how many games of Archon I played, Light vs. Dark, in the, in the, probably in the year 83, or later.

895
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:02,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it, Eddie!

896
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:09,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, did you see, this is also kind of PC related, did you see the thing that they were talking about in Spore?

897
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:20,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they were showing off some stuff at DICE also, and one of the demonstrations that they showed were, um, it was, I believe the Care Bears vs. the Klingons?

898
00:54:20,294 --> 00:54:20,895
Ha ha ha!

899
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:24,337
[SPEAKER_05]: It created the two races and had them battle it out.

900
00:54:26,038 --> 00:54:27,519
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kaplaster!

901
00:54:30,461 --> 00:54:32,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait until that game comes out.

902
00:54:32,722 --> 00:54:35,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to just become a hermit once that game comes out.

903
00:54:37,264 --> 00:54:38,065
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have your game.

904
00:54:38,085 --> 00:54:38,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have Archon.

905
00:54:39,065 --> 00:54:39,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie?

906
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:41,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie will have Cookie Mama on the Wii.

907
00:54:41,426 --> 00:54:42,027
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all happy.

908
00:54:42,107 --> 00:54:44,108
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know what they should resurrect from all PC days?

909
00:54:44,728 --> 00:54:46,549
[SPEAKER_01]: On the DS, they could do Return to Zork.

910
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Zork is awesome!

911
00:54:49,146 --> 00:54:51,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Only the nerdiest of the nerds, because that would work perfectly on DS.

912
00:54:51,607 --> 00:54:54,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We found a 404 page that was the first Zork.

913
00:54:55,509 --> 00:54:56,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, the text game?

914
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:57,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

915
00:54:57,971 --> 00:54:59,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, by the way... Oh, good point.

916
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:01,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob D in chat says, Jamie will have Rondo of Blood.

917
00:55:02,093 --> 00:55:04,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will have Rondo of Blood.

918
00:55:04,274 --> 00:55:06,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to talk about Rondo of Blood every five seconds, by the way.

919
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookie Mama did get pushed up into March.

920
00:55:09,297 --> 00:55:11,998
[SPEAKER_05]: It originally was in April, so it's coming out sooner.

921
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:13,899
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be out before my birthday.

922
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:17,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know that Eddie actually told me about a fantasy he had once?

923
00:55:17,868 --> 00:55:20,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie's fantasy was that he actually gets eaten by a grue.

924
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:25,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you get that joke, you're awesome.

925
00:55:26,654 --> 00:55:27,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn out the lights, Rob.

926
00:55:29,676 --> 00:55:30,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me five, you're a winner.

927
00:55:30,957 --> 00:55:32,398
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, because the lights have to be off.

928
00:55:32,478 --> 00:55:34,079
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all getting eaten by grues.

929
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:36,020
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a grue.

930
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:42,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you stab the innkeeper, and then the sheriff will come.

931
00:55:44,765 --> 00:55:45,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I found you a grue.

932
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:48,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Morpheus.

933
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:52,951
[SPEAKER_07]: This show makes me happy.

934
00:55:55,276 --> 00:55:55,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this.

935
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:56,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pitch black.

936
00:55:56,999 --> 00:55:58,262
[SPEAKER_02]: You are likely to be eaten by a Gru.

937
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:00,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

938
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:04,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I looked on the internet, it's only 95 megabytes, so they could totally have that on the DS.

939
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:08,160
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to look that up on Wikipedia, by the way, that's G-R-U-E.

940
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your homework, kids.

941
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,120
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a Gru?

942
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,922
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gru is a sinister-looking presence in the dark places of the Earth.

943
00:56:14,422 --> 00:56:18,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light.

944
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:23,424
[SPEAKER_02]: No Gru has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.

945
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:25,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Gru.

946
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:25,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Gru.

947
00:56:25,948 --> 00:56:31,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I read somewhere in an M. Night Shyamalan film that Groos hang out with scrunts, actually.

948
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:33,294
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a scrunt.

949
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:36,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob's a scrunny bitch.

950
00:56:36,256 --> 00:56:38,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's the scruntiest person in the room.

951
00:56:38,457 --> 00:56:39,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You dirty scrunt.

952
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to console news, DarkSakura.

953
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:45,483
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

954
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:47,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm busy looking at pictures of Captain America.

955
00:56:48,485 --> 00:56:49,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Rondo of Blood.

956
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:52,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll steal your story.

957
00:56:52,648 --> 00:56:53,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Sega Sammy.

958
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:54,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

959
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Sega, Sega, Sega.

960
00:56:57,963 --> 00:56:58,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

961
00:56:58,603 --> 00:56:58,783
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

962
00:56:58,803 --> 00:56:59,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

963
00:56:59,944 --> 00:57:00,225
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

964
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:01,305
[SPEAKER_03]: That.

965
00:57:01,746 --> 00:57:02,306
[SPEAKER_03]: That what?

966
00:57:02,526 --> 00:57:02,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see.

967
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:04,768
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an upcoming story.

968
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:05,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

969
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:08,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega, how the mighty have fallen.

970
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:08,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega!

971
00:57:09,432 --> 00:57:09,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

972
00:57:10,413 --> 00:57:11,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturn.

973
00:57:12,674 --> 00:57:14,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega-ta-san-shiro.

974
00:57:14,596 --> 00:57:15,036
[SPEAKER_02]: No, anyway.

975
00:57:15,757 --> 00:57:16,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

976
00:57:16,097 --> 00:57:16,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill me!

977
00:57:17,878 --> 00:57:21,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, after the show though, we need you to set up the thing.

978
00:57:21,962 --> 00:57:22,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

979
00:57:22,947 --> 00:57:31,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega Sammy profits have slid 23% and I blame them for abandoning the Dreamcast.

980
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:37,494
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, their net income went down from $526 million to $409 million.

981
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:38,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Sales dropped by 4% to $3.35 billion.

982
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:55,151
[SPEAKER_05]: You could say that their sales flew off course like a poorly controlled Sonic from Sonic the Hedgehog on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

983
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:55,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

984
00:57:56,472 --> 00:58:01,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, their Pachinko machines are actually becoming a lot less popular than they were, too.

985
00:58:02,073 --> 00:58:04,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pachinko is really, really a big thing.

986
00:58:04,733 --> 00:58:15,115
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 has been spamming the chatroom, and usually I don't encourage this, but spamming the chatroom with this site, SegaSucks.net, and I'm looking at it, and it looks like somebody's Geocities webpage.

987
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:17,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's my Geocities webpage!

988
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:22,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, way to use... Let me look at the FAQ.

989
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:25,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Way to use the, like, center, um... Or the about page.

990
00:58:26,644 --> 00:58:27,524
[SPEAKER_05]: The center paragraph.

991
00:58:27,544 --> 00:58:39,008
[SPEAKER_07]: See, about this site, the first, last, and only thing Sega fans ever have to say when I try to tell them my site is about stopping companies from ripping gamers off is, ha ha, yessiree, don't you know all companies are just out to make money?

992
00:58:39,488 --> 00:58:41,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob, Bob, Bob, I'm like... Who uses the word yessiree?

993
00:58:41,428 --> 00:58:41,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

994
00:58:42,029 --> 00:58:42,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yessiree, Bob!

995
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:43,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna say, yeah.

996
00:58:44,485 --> 00:58:48,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a new... Loki, you have a new story to talk to us about?

997
00:58:48,468 --> 00:58:50,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, let's talk about Crackdown.

998
00:58:50,089 --> 00:58:50,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sirree.

999
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Crackdown, one of the most awesome games this week.

1000
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:56,713
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the demo is.

1001
00:58:57,854 --> 00:59:12,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only going to be... They're only going to have male avatars to play as right now, because apparently they haven't finished the female ones, and I guess the females would have a whole new set of animations for bulking up as you progress through the game, so...

1002
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:15,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget periods So yeah, if you're looking to play a female character

1003
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,081
[SPEAKER_05]: That won't be happening.

1004
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:43,961
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what, though?

1005
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:51,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Crackdown was one of those games that they said that if later on they wanted to add a new island, a new set of gangs or whatever, they could do that.

1006
00:59:51,524 --> 00:59:53,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't see why they wouldn't build a woman gang.

1007
00:59:53,986 --> 00:59:55,486
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, female avatars later.

1008
00:59:55,606 --> 00:59:58,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's probably going to be in Download Pack.

1009
00:59:58,268 --> 01:00:02,670
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here to complain you to death!

1010
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:09,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, you have your agility, firearms, explosives, and driving.

1011
01:00:09,813 --> 01:00:10,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

1012
01:00:10,863 --> 01:00:12,604
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't level up driving skills.

1013
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:13,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

1014
01:00:13,964 --> 01:00:16,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And so complaining, I guess, would have to be in there.

1015
01:00:18,145 --> 01:00:21,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Bershaz in chat makes the very mature comment, boobie go boom.

1016
01:00:25,307 --> 01:00:30,068
[SPEAKER_07]: TheRobD says, well, they thought the driving was enough simulation of being a woman anyway.

1017
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:32,589
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, comment.

1018
01:00:33,009 --> 01:00:34,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking forward to playing a woman in Crackdown?

1019
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:39,811
[SPEAKER_02]: You are putting me looking forward and Crackdown in the same sentence.

1020
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:42,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie can't give two shits about Crackdown.

1021
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,050
[SPEAKER_02]: She just can't.

1022
01:00:44,751 --> 01:00:45,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, really.

1023
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:48,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even with, you know, X-Lax.

1024
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:51,835
[SPEAKER_05]: She's constipated when it comes to Crackdown.

1025
01:00:53,136 --> 01:00:55,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I would need a colonic.

1026
01:00:55,317 --> 01:00:55,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1027
01:00:57,618 --> 01:01:02,140
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if I lose a little more weight, every time I bend over, you're going to see a Crackdown, actually.

1028
01:01:05,282 --> 01:01:05,662
Gross.

1029
01:01:07,242 --> 01:01:12,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of things coming out your ass, EGM posted seven rumors in their magazine.

1030
01:01:13,665 --> 01:01:17,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how founded these rumors are or not, but I'm going to share them with you now.

1031
01:01:17,446 --> 01:01:19,407
[SPEAKER_07]: These are from issue number 213.

1032
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:23,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor number one we already talked about a little bit earlier in the program.

1033
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:28,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Square has another MMO in the works for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1034
01:01:29,051 --> 01:01:32,312
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't be in Vanadil, but a world from previous FF games.

1035
01:01:32,452 --> 01:01:34,013
[SPEAKER_12]: So that could be in tandem with... Is it Avalos?

1036
01:01:34,747 --> 01:01:36,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, it could be in a Valis game.

1037
01:01:36,107 --> 01:01:36,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, that'd be awesome.

1038
01:01:37,588 --> 01:01:40,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, what if it was like Final Fantasy VI MMO?

1039
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:41,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure a lot of folks have a boner over that.

1040
01:01:41,669 --> 01:01:42,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I would hella play that.

1041
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:44,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor two is that Tekken 6 got pushed back until 2008.

1042
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Cute, cute, anyway.

1043
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Jamie.

1044
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Tekken 6, 2008.

1045
01:01:49,411 --> 01:01:50,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Bastards!

1046
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:51,711
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a rumor, though.

1047
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:52,712
[SPEAKER_07]: EGM could be full of it.

1048
01:01:52,872 --> 01:01:53,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards!

1049
01:01:53,712 --> 01:01:54,532
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's probably true.

1050
01:01:55,672 --> 01:02:00,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor three, Mistwalker is planning a Blue Dragon 2, but only if it does well in the US.

1051
01:02:00,794 --> 01:02:02,374
[SPEAKER_07]: A DS spinoff is also possible.

1052
01:02:03,965 --> 01:02:09,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor number four is Wipeout will hit the PlayStation 3 in 2007 and it uses the MotorStorm engine.

1053
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:10,569
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be interesting.

1054
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:17,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor number five is, oh, my hero, Mizuguchi, is working on a Space Channel 5 follow-up.

1055
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:19,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Channel 6.

1056
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:20,616
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

1057
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it's called, but that would be awesome.

1058
01:02:22,557 --> 01:02:26,740
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be Space Channel 5 2, like MTV 2.

1059
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:30,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor number six is there's an Indiana Jones game to hit with a movie in 2008.

1060
01:02:30,142 --> 01:02:30,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh!

1061
01:02:30,282 --> 01:02:30,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh!

1062
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Every freaking big movie gets a game time.

1063
01:02:34,131 --> 01:02:36,772
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already seen that at E3.

1064
01:02:37,073 --> 01:02:37,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh.

1065
01:02:37,513 --> 01:02:38,193
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a rumor.

1066
01:02:38,834 --> 01:02:42,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And then lastly, EA is making a Kitty Madden.

1067
01:02:43,156 --> 01:02:43,676
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.

1068
01:02:43,696 --> 01:02:49,819
[SPEAKER_05]: They already have an Atari, like the backyard football and stuff that sucks balls, so they could easily do that.

1069
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:50,960
[SPEAKER_05]: What is a Kitty Madden?

1070
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Kitty Madden?

1071
01:02:51,941 --> 01:02:52,061
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1072
01:02:52,821 --> 01:02:58,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they're bringing the puppy bowl and the kitty halftime to the consoles we talked about last week.

1073
01:02:58,864 --> 01:03:00,025
[SPEAKER_07]: EA has heard our prayers.

1074
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:00,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1075
01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:03,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what it would sound like?

1076
01:03:04,089 --> 01:03:05,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of, yeah.

1077
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:05,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we hear that again?

1078
01:03:06,311 --> 01:03:07,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Meow, meow, meow.

1079
01:03:07,191 --> 01:03:08,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, that was great.

1080
01:03:08,172 --> 01:03:10,754
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

1081
01:03:10,794 --> 01:03:11,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1082
01:03:12,896 --> 01:03:13,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Playing football.

1083
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew Nami says Space Channel 5 2 was already leased, wasn't it?

1084
01:03:16,879 --> 01:03:19,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's true, but more Space Channel 5 could not be a bad thing.

1085
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:24,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Space Channel 5 2, and that gave me fit, because of the whole backwards level.

1086
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:25,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I want pudding.

1087
01:03:25,925 --> 01:03:28,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I want more, not like actual pudding, but the character.

1088
01:03:28,207 --> 01:03:29,268
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, way to be random.

1089
01:03:30,663 --> 01:03:32,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Bershaw's one said EA's Lingerie Bowl 2008.

1090
01:03:32,885 --> 01:03:36,409
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be one for the kids.

1091
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:42,255
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to be taking... Irene does have a point.

1092
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:45,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see kittens in, like, little football jerseys.

1093
01:03:45,718 --> 01:03:49,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but that would be... As cute as it is, I would probably buy that.

1094
01:03:52,064 --> 01:03:54,287
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, we'll see if EA answers your question.

1095
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,241
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be getting your Skype calls very, very soon.

1096
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:58,221
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a couple more stories.

1097
01:03:58,461 --> 01:04:00,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's a bunch of no shit, Sherlock.

1098
01:04:01,982 --> 01:04:08,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Wii has outsold the PS3 by a mere 3 to 1 ratio in January in Japan.

1099
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:09,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Take that, bitches!

1100
01:04:11,323 --> 01:04:13,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like I said, a bunch of no shit there.

1101
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:28,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I do remember, actually one of my coworkers was asking me, he read an article that some PlayStation rep or someone at Sony was claiming that the PS3 was outselling the Wii and the DS combined in Japan.

1102
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:36,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't make our show roll tonight because there was a lot of news, but there was a pretty well-circulated story out there that somebody from Sony Computer Europe said something like,

1103
01:04:37,117 --> 01:04:43,364
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can find a PlayStation 3 out there on store shelves, I'll give you $1,200 or something like that.

1104
01:04:43,524 --> 01:04:47,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they promptly proceeded to show four of them at the same place.

1105
01:04:47,768 --> 01:04:48,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1106
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:50,791
[SPEAKER_07]: As I saw a bunch of them at GameStop today.

1107
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:54,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, I could have made $12,000, but I don't think he was serious.

1108
01:04:55,096 --> 01:04:59,080
[SPEAKER_02]: See, if they're selling at a 3-to-1 ratio, so basically...

1109
01:05:00,169 --> 01:05:01,792
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making $900 for every $600 that Sony makes.

1110
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:02,833
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already beating them by $300 per system.

1111
01:05:14,473 --> 01:05:20,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not per system, but per group sale if you're comparing Nintendo's 3 to Sony's 1.

1112
01:05:20,615 --> 01:05:25,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not even counting if they're doing the high-end system or the low-end system.

1113
01:05:25,776 --> 01:05:29,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So even profit-wise, Nintendo's got the head above it.

1114
01:05:29,537 --> 01:05:36,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some people, I've actually argued this with some people, they're saying, oh, since Sony's selling for more, they're going to make more money.

1115
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:43,421
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because Nintendo loves us and supply is doing its damned best to meet demand.

1116
01:05:43,843 --> 01:05:45,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, this is great.

1117
01:05:45,564 --> 01:05:51,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew Nami sent me a link to this week's Penny Arcade, which actually makes fun of this specific instance as well.

1118
01:05:52,005 --> 01:05:59,628
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, in a recent interview, SEA President Jack Tretton claimed that he would pay a $1,200 bounty on any PS3 system that was found on store shelves.

1119
01:06:00,028 --> 01:06:04,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And they went around town and proceeded to get two at the Best Buy across the street, one at the Target, da-da-da.

1120
01:06:04,849 --> 01:06:06,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the end, they'd racked up $13,200.

1121
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:12,011
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it says, when we get the money, we should go get a couple Wii's.

1122
01:06:12,592 --> 01:06:13,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if we can find one.

1123
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:20,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is, you know what, if you're a Sony fanboy, I'm sorry that we keep picking on you, but it's true.

1124
01:06:20,691 --> 01:06:22,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Wii's are still hard to come by.

1125
01:06:22,432 --> 01:06:27,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind what I said earlier in Part A about the guy who came, dude, I got a Wii today, I actually found one.

1126
01:06:27,076 --> 01:06:28,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Target got a shipment this morning.

1127
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:33,580
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true, like, Wii's are still kind of hard to come by, and PlayStation 3s are out there.

1128
01:06:33,861 --> 01:06:41,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my local Blockbuster, like, all the employees there are, like, vying for the Nintendo, and, like, I go in and they'll be like, oh my god, I got mine, because they, like, cannot find them.

1129
01:06:42,142 --> 01:06:42,782
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.

1130
01:06:42,802 --> 01:06:43,242
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what?

1131
01:06:43,423 --> 01:06:47,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Once Tactics comes out on PSP, the PSP is going to outsell the PS3 again.

1132
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:48,385
[SPEAKER_07]: You think?

1133
01:06:48,565 --> 01:06:49,925
[SPEAKER_07]: The PSP is going to outsell the PS3?

1134
01:06:50,145 --> 01:06:51,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, when Tactics comes out.

1135
01:06:51,766 --> 01:06:54,107
[SPEAKER_07]: You are not a PSP fangirl in the least.

1136
01:06:54,127 --> 01:06:55,588
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely am not.

1137
01:06:55,668 --> 01:06:56,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I could care less.

1138
01:06:56,688 --> 01:07:03,771
[SPEAKER_12]: But with this news about Tactics coming on to PSP with the frickin' Dark Knights, I'm so happy.

1139
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:05,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you just cum?

1140
01:07:05,392 --> 01:07:06,172
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?

1141
01:07:06,252 --> 01:07:06,912
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit.

1142
01:07:07,653 --> 01:07:11,094
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, and then Castlevania, and then Luminous 2, and...

1143
01:07:11,772 --> 01:07:13,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think I'm going to have to invest in one.

1144
01:07:13,873 --> 01:07:14,113
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1145
01:07:14,473 --> 01:07:17,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you, Jamie, for the Japanese sales report.

1146
01:07:17,595 --> 01:07:20,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Or should I say, arigato.

1147
01:07:21,316 --> 01:07:28,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I did find something completely unrelated, though, and that's someone made Captain America in SmackDown vs. Raw.

1148
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:29,420
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

1149
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,420
[SPEAKER_07]: That's completely unrelated.

1150
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I think it's pretty funny.

1151
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:33,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1152
01:07:34,202 --> 01:07:37,143
[SPEAKER_07]: One more story, and then we're going to go to our Skype line at 877-GAME-OLR.

1153
01:07:38,933 --> 01:07:39,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1154
01:08:04,011 --> 01:08:09,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, no details really on the game at all, except that they were supposed to be starting from scratch again.

1155
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:11,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever that means.

1156
01:08:14,635 --> 01:08:17,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Mortal Kombat on the Unreal Engine?

1157
01:08:17,496 --> 01:08:20,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is it going to be like a 3D fighter?

1158
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:25,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they say it's not going to be like a fighting type game like we know today.

1159
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:30,420
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't help but think of some of those really crappy Mythologies games at Sub-Zero.

1160
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:30,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

1161
01:08:51,087 --> 01:08:55,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess we'll open up the Skype line and see what our listeners have to say about that.

1162
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:56,330
[SPEAKER_07]: You can give us a call.

1163
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:59,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.

1164
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:01,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1165
01:09:02,113 --> 01:09:04,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you can give us a call with the old-fashioned telephone.

1166
01:09:05,394 --> 01:09:07,676
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1167
01:09:08,496 --> 01:09:14,159
[SPEAKER_07]: That's toll-free in the United States and Canada, but not toll-free, sad face, abroad.

1168
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:18,681
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have to use the Skype line if you're in the UK or Australia, in which case it's probably past your bedtime.

1169
01:09:18,961 --> 01:09:19,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait.

1170
01:09:19,362 --> 01:09:20,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say, what?

1171
01:09:20,714 --> 01:09:23,697
[SPEAKER_12]: They have to use the old-fashioned telephone, like a rotary phone?

1172
01:09:24,017 --> 01:09:25,598
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can use touch-tone.

1173
01:09:25,638 --> 01:09:26,379
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be acceptable.

1174
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a party line where you call the operator.

1175
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:30,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Like two cans and a stream?

1176
01:09:30,142 --> 01:09:31,243
[SPEAKER_07]: A cellular telephone.

1177
01:09:31,624 --> 01:09:33,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we're having the Dixie Cups installed this week.

1178
01:09:34,026 --> 01:09:34,886
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fascinating.

1179
01:09:35,307 --> 01:09:38,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And people will be able to use the two tin cans and a piece of yarn to talk to us soon.

1180
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:41,833
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on Orange Lodge Radio.

1181
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:42,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this caller?

1182
01:09:43,294 --> 01:09:43,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of Zaku.

1183
01:09:44,295 --> 01:09:45,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

1184
01:09:45,696 --> 01:09:46,417
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

1185
01:09:47,638 --> 01:09:47,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh...

1186
01:09:48,655 --> 01:09:50,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Just random stuff.

1187
01:09:50,476 --> 01:09:52,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I know you're full of random stuff tonight.

1188
01:09:52,336 --> 01:09:53,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not taking it back, by the way.

1189
01:09:54,537 --> 01:09:55,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Zach, what's on your mind?

1190
01:09:55,978 --> 01:10:05,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I meant, basically what I meant when I said that was that, you know, just like a manager is like a captain on a ship, he's responsible for everyone that runs it.

1191
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:08,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's pretty much the analogy.

1192
01:10:09,402 --> 01:10:11,563
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to admit, though, it was a weird-ass comparison.

1193
01:10:11,603 --> 01:10:17,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but is a responsible captain on a ship going to order his crew to throw their shipment overboard?

1194
01:10:20,895 --> 01:10:29,407
[SPEAKER_02]: You were doing it as though your reference specifically stated that the manager was ordering the employees Isn't that what happened at the Boston Tea Party?

1195
01:10:32,932 --> 01:10:33,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Touche.

1196
01:10:33,994 --> 01:10:34,695
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1197
01:10:36,388 --> 01:10:38,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank your comparisons through before stating them.

1198
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:39,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand what you mean.

1199
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,432
[SPEAKER_02]: However, your comparison was completely off-base.

1200
01:10:42,512 --> 01:10:43,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't we just all get along?

1201
01:10:44,034 --> 01:10:44,334
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

1202
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:45,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hug.

1203
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Not until you buy me pie.

1204
01:10:46,755 --> 01:10:50,778
[SPEAKER_12]: If you changed the T in touche to a D, it'd be douchey.

1205
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:52,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up!

1206
01:10:52,699 --> 01:10:54,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Saku, please, put us back on track.

1207
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,301
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you want to talk about?

1208
01:10:55,741 --> 01:10:55,941
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1209
01:10:56,101 --> 01:10:56,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh?

1210
01:10:56,262 --> 01:10:57,082
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1211
01:11:02,597 --> 01:11:04,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear to God I'm not fucking with this connection.

1212
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, are you fucking with this connection?

1213
01:11:07,259 --> 01:11:08,700
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm watching someone draw Captain America.

1214
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Zaku, try it one more time.

1215
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:12,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, if you can't get it out clearly, we're going to have to move on.

1216
01:11:12,662 --> 01:11:13,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Zaku, what was on your mind?

1217
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:20,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Send it in a text message, Zaku.

1218
01:11:20,926 --> 01:11:22,247
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll try to get to it later.

1219
01:11:22,847 --> 01:11:24,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, but it's just not coming through.

1220
01:11:24,628 --> 01:11:26,109
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll hear it on the playback.

1221
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:28,810
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a bummer.

1222
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, if you want to call us, 877-GAME-OLR

1223
01:11:32,202 --> 01:11:33,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear I was not screwing with that call.

1224
01:11:35,404 --> 01:11:37,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor Saku.

1225
01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:38,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Send your question over private message, Saku.

1226
01:11:39,005 --> 01:11:39,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take it.

1227
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,586
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go to this call.

1228
01:11:41,606 --> 01:11:42,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

1229
01:11:42,547 --> 01:11:42,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1230
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:45,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.

1231
01:11:45,889 --> 01:11:46,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Paradox Vincent.

1232
01:11:46,809 --> 01:11:47,489
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1233
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:53,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I recently acquired a laptop.

1234
01:11:55,693 --> 01:11:59,035
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a new VAIO, and it had Vista on it.

1235
01:11:59,995 --> 01:12:01,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, so it's a brand new laptop.

1236
01:12:01,296 --> 01:12:01,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1237
01:12:02,523 --> 01:12:06,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, um, do not like it at all.

1238
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:08,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1239
01:12:08,186 --> 01:12:08,786
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong with it?

1240
01:12:11,068 --> 01:12:22,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, there are some, uh, there are some applications on it that aren't exactly, you know, uh, well, there's smaller applications.

1241
01:12:23,294 --> 01:12:31,939
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them, I think, is actually a foreign one called Bimania DX, and it's kind of like the Stepmania of B-Mania.

1242
01:12:32,469 --> 01:12:32,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1243
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:33,690
[SPEAKER_07]: That wouldn't work.

1244
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:42,414
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um... So, basically, you're upset because a lot of the old games and things you were using on Windows XP won't work on Windows Vista.

1245
01:12:44,455 --> 01:12:59,723
[SPEAKER_09]: That, and also that, uh... I'm trying to remember... The main reason that I downloaded it, well, one of them was for music creation software, and my sequencer wouldn't work on it.

1246
01:12:59,803 --> 01:13:01,404
[SPEAKER_09]: It just performs...

1247
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:02,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1248
01:13:02,721 --> 01:13:02,821
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1249
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,842
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um... Yes.

1250
01:13:04,862 --> 01:13:05,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always said that, uh...

1251
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:27,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it a couple of years and I'm pretty sure that it'll be an awesome application.

1252
01:13:27,957 --> 01:13:31,179
[SPEAKER_07]: So what caused you to jump on board the Vista train at this point?

1253
01:13:31,219 --> 01:13:33,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it just because you had no other choice because you got the new laptop?

1254
01:13:34,942 --> 01:13:37,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they took the model out that I was going to get.

1255
01:13:37,644 --> 01:13:40,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

1256
01:13:41,387 --> 01:13:50,314
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's really too bad because it's a great skin, but I can do everything that I'm doing on Vista with an XP.

1257
01:13:51,535 --> 01:13:57,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking forward to any of the gaming that's supposed to be coming out with the Vista, such as Halo 2 or any of that stuff?

1258
01:14:00,543 --> 01:14:01,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of.

1259
01:14:02,364 --> 01:14:12,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I have a little more powerful Windows machine, because my other two were pretty... They were really, really old.

1260
01:14:13,473 --> 01:14:17,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that I have something... I got a 2.3...

1261
01:14:20,484 --> 01:14:24,467
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1262
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:57,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, well, also, I'd like to kind of give my opinion on, uh, the, uh, how Konami basically releases the same game over and over again, but with new songs.

1263
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, quickly, please, because we've got to keep moving.

1264
01:15:01,489 --> 01:15:12,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever I bought a new Beatmania game, at least, I don't know about DDR, but when I bought a new Beatmania game, I significantly improved.

1265
01:15:12,637 --> 01:15:15,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost jumped another level up.

1266
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:16,199
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1267
01:15:17,006 --> 01:15:22,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that new songs are really all that I need to justify a whole new game.

1268
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:22,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1269
01:15:22,371 --> 01:15:22,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1270
01:15:22,511 --> 01:15:22,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1271
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:22,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

1272
01:15:22,931 --> 01:15:23,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1273
01:15:43,382 --> 01:15:44,802
[SPEAKER_12]: So he has a huge EP in him?

1274
01:15:45,043 --> 01:15:45,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he has a huge EP.

1275
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:52,965
[SPEAKER_07]: He was kind of, he's kind of, it sounded like either he was high or he had the show on in the background and he was listening to it because I thought I heard myself recall it.

1276
01:15:52,985 --> 01:15:54,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe both.

1277
01:15:54,146 --> 01:15:54,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe both.

1278
01:15:55,486 --> 01:15:56,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

1279
01:15:56,426 --> 01:15:57,387
[SPEAKER_07]: We tease because we love.

1280
01:15:57,427 --> 01:15:58,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to some other calls.

1281
01:16:00,068 --> 01:16:02,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go over here to this call.

1282
01:16:02,949 --> 01:16:03,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1283
01:16:03,929 --> 01:16:04,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1284
01:16:08,092 --> 01:16:09,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's Seisha here.

1285
01:16:09,372 --> 01:16:10,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Seisha, what's on your mind?

1286
01:16:10,673 --> 01:16:12,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn down your speakers, because we can hear ourselves a little bit.

1287
01:16:12,854 --> 01:16:13,334
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

1288
01:16:16,515 --> 01:16:17,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hearing it echoing.

1289
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:20,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, it's echoing.

1290
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:21,617
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

1291
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:22,837
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

1292
01:16:22,897 --> 01:16:23,798
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a delay, too.

1293
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:27,399
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's because our voices are traveling all the way across the Atlantic.

1294
01:16:27,419 --> 01:16:30,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I was just going to ask a question about Final Fantasy XII.

1295
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, what do you want to know about Final Fantasy XII?

1296
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:42,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know where this story leads to because I look on the internet everywhere and I can't find anything about it and I like spoilers.

1297
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,414
[SPEAKER_07]: You want spoilers on the story?

1298
01:16:48,676 --> 01:16:49,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm impatient.

1299
01:16:50,717 --> 01:16:59,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't tell you that because that would ruin it for our listeners, but you could go to GameFAQs.com and there's a bunch of FAQs on how to get through the game or the strategy guide that's available.

1300
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:02,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's places out there where you can get it spoiled.

1301
01:17:02,404 --> 01:17:03,765
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just not looking hard enough, buddy.

1302
01:17:05,063 --> 01:17:07,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And besides, I haven't beaten it, so I couldn't tell you what happens.

1303
01:17:08,644 --> 01:17:11,464
[SPEAKER_07]: There was like 50 games that came out in November that I haven't played.

1304
01:17:11,484 --> 01:17:12,205
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't beaten it yet?

1305
01:17:12,225 --> 01:17:12,885
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I haven't.

1306
01:17:12,905 --> 01:17:15,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gotten like... I got sucked back into WoW.

1307
01:17:17,506 --> 01:17:17,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, true.

1308
01:17:17,986 --> 01:17:19,086
[SPEAKER_10]: I got back into WoW.

1309
01:17:19,746 --> 01:17:20,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Like at level 70 already.

1310
01:17:22,707 --> 01:17:23,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well.

1311
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:28,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there anything else you wanted to ask us about tonight besides the spoilers for Final Fantasy XII, which we're not sharing?

1312
01:17:30,289 --> 01:17:32,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you so crazy this evening?

1313
01:17:33,044 --> 01:17:34,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're... I don't know.

1314
01:17:34,045 --> 01:17:35,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we crazy this evening?

1315
01:17:35,646 --> 01:17:36,246
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my fault.

1316
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:40,169
[SPEAKER_07]: That's partially Eddie and Rice Princess being here, but what else?

1317
01:17:40,209 --> 01:17:41,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's just something in the air.

1318
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:46,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I'm a little bit unable to concentrate quite correctly today.

1319
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:49,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Banks, you sound really cute and hot.

1320
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:51,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop trying to get a date on the show.

1321
01:17:51,777 --> 01:17:53,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, how am I supposed to date you?

1322
01:17:53,358 --> 01:17:54,579
[SPEAKER_12]: You sound sexy.

1323
01:17:54,619 --> 01:17:55,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1324
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:56,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means he's probably taken.

1325
01:17:58,482 --> 01:17:59,182
[SPEAKER_07]: What was I going to say?

1326
01:17:59,402 --> 01:17:59,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1327
01:18:01,676 --> 01:18:02,917
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1328
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:34,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Sasha, we gotta let you go, but thanks so much for your phone call.

1329
01:18:34,967 --> 01:18:35,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And cheers.

1330
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:39,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

1331
01:18:39,991 --> 01:18:40,871
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too much delay.

1332
01:18:40,911 --> 01:18:41,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't keep it going.

1333
01:18:41,952 --> 01:18:42,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, kids.

1334
01:18:42,352 --> 01:18:43,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to say bi-sexy.

1335
01:18:43,493 --> 01:18:44,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks a lot.

1336
01:18:45,014 --> 01:18:45,434
[SPEAKER_07]: We got it.

1337
01:18:45,915 --> 01:18:46,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Say it now.

1338
01:18:46,495 --> 01:18:47,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Sasha's listening.

1339
01:18:47,235 --> 01:18:47,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Bi-sexy.

1340
01:18:47,996 --> 01:18:48,416
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1341
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:50,397
[SPEAKER_07]: You are so weird.

1342
01:18:50,598 --> 01:18:51,218
[SPEAKER_12]: You're weird.

1343
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:52,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Your face is weird.

1344
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:53,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1345
01:18:53,419 --> 01:18:53,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1346
01:18:56,822 --> 01:18:58,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1347
01:18:58,183 --> 01:18:58,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1348
01:19:00,592 --> 01:19:01,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hi, this is Uni.

1349
01:19:02,093 --> 01:19:03,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, what's on your mind?

1350
01:19:03,815 --> 01:19:05,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, sexy pants?

1351
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:08,759
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, sweetie?

1352
01:19:12,242 --> 01:19:14,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I crack me up, too.

1353
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:24,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to ask you guys if World of Warcraft was really worth it, because... Wait, we can hardly hear you.

1354
01:19:24,652 --> 01:19:26,133
[SPEAKER_07]: What about World of Warcraft?

1355
01:19:26,153 --> 01:19:27,434
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to ask what about World of Warcraft?

1356
01:19:32,654 --> 01:19:34,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really worth it?

1357
01:19:35,115 --> 01:19:40,298
[SPEAKER_07]: She's actually being eaten by a Gru as she's talking to us, which is why she can't stop laughing.

1358
01:19:41,099 --> 01:19:44,221
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so worth it.

1359
01:19:44,261 --> 01:19:46,882
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the biggest addict probably out of all of us, right, Princess?

1360
01:19:46,922 --> 01:19:47,383
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

1361
01:19:48,601 --> 01:19:48,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1362
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:51,403
[SPEAKER_07]: You hated all MMOs before World of Warcraft.

1363
01:19:51,543 --> 01:19:51,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

1364
01:19:51,783 --> 01:19:52,804
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely hated them.

1365
01:19:52,844 --> 01:19:54,806
[SPEAKER_07]: What sold you on World of Warcraft specifically?

1366
01:19:55,026 --> 01:19:56,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't know.

1367
01:19:56,767 --> 01:19:59,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that was an awesome answer.

1368
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:02,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Matt gave me the two-week demo-y disc thing, whatever.

1369
01:20:02,992 --> 01:20:04,193
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all Matt, our friend.

1370
01:20:04,373 --> 01:20:04,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Love you, Matt.

1371
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:07,860
[SPEAKER_12]: and I was like, whatever, I'm bored.

1372
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,101
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not working.

1373
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:09,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Uni hung up.

1374
01:20:10,261 --> 01:20:11,041
[SPEAKER_07]: She was embarrassed.

1375
01:20:11,962 --> 01:20:12,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be embarrassed.

1376
01:20:12,662 --> 01:20:13,363
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

1377
01:20:13,703 --> 01:20:15,884
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, okay, I'll give it a try.

1378
01:20:15,964 --> 01:20:22,567
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got to level 20 in like two days or something and you can't go past level 20 if you're on the demo thing.

1379
01:20:22,587 --> 01:20:24,168
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, oh man, that sucks.

1380
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:25,288
[SPEAKER_12]: This game's awesome.

1381
01:20:25,368 --> 01:20:28,290
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I subscribed to it and then I signed my life away.

1382
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:29,450
[SPEAKER_12]: It was pretty awesome.

1383
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:35,113
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Paradox Vincent, who I accused of being high earlier, sent me a message and said, no, you're a tell-all.

1384
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:42,842
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Tyrant wants to know, Rice Princess, what level are you?

1385
01:20:43,483 --> 01:20:46,285
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have any 60s and I've been playing for two years.

1386
01:20:46,565 --> 01:20:47,907
[SPEAKER_12]: But you're a twink.

1387
01:20:48,007 --> 01:20:48,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because you're a twink.

1388
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:49,768
[SPEAKER_12]: I have many twinks.

1389
01:20:50,409 --> 01:20:52,170
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a lot of PVP twinks.

1390
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:54,272
[SPEAKER_07]: War Song Gold Show for life.

1391
01:20:56,914 --> 01:20:58,456
[SPEAKER_12]: My highest level tune is a 38 Warlock.

1392
01:21:00,738 --> 01:21:01,338
[SPEAKER_12]: on Trollbane.

1393
01:21:01,618 --> 01:21:09,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Uni, I bet you any of the WoW players would be glad to hook you up with a free demo of WoW because they do that thing where you can download a demo on worldofwarcraft.com.

1394
01:21:09,562 --> 01:21:10,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what?

1395
01:21:10,762 --> 01:21:12,903
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the whole Xbox 360 strategy.

1396
01:21:13,063 --> 01:21:14,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Demos, try before you buy.

1397
01:21:14,504 --> 01:21:15,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's the best way to figure it out.

1398
01:21:16,065 --> 01:21:17,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, girl, and I'll play with you.

1399
01:21:17,925 --> 01:21:18,646
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1400
01:21:18,746 --> 01:21:19,286
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll show you around, girl.

1401
01:21:19,306 --> 01:21:20,146
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the girls' club.

1402
01:21:20,346 --> 01:21:21,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the girls' club on Warcraft.

1403
01:21:21,447 --> 01:21:23,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we get our hair did in the game.

1404
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:26,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, here it is.

1405
01:21:26,389 --> 01:21:28,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Uni says the classic, it's just that I want a blood elf.

1406
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,127
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1407
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:41,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the gay twink.

1408
01:21:41,242 --> 01:21:42,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the gay porn kind of twink.

1409
01:21:42,743 --> 01:21:45,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't know what that is, you're fine.

1410
01:21:45,605 --> 01:21:46,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, a gay, yeah.

1411
01:21:46,705 --> 01:21:49,207
[SPEAKER_07]: What is a twink in WoW, Bryce Princess?

1412
01:21:49,287 --> 01:21:50,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Where does the name come from?

1413
01:21:50,027 --> 01:21:58,172
[SPEAKER_12]: A twink in WoW is someone that has the best possible gear, the best enchants, the best everything that you can have at that level.

1414
01:21:58,712 --> 01:22:01,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And it helps if they have blonde hair and they're usually Russian.

1415
01:22:01,654 --> 01:22:02,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Russian.

1416
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:05,718
[SPEAKER_12]: You're terrible, Ron.

1417
01:22:06,078 --> 01:22:11,761
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have a lot of twinks, and it's easy for me because I'm a girl, and I say, Hi, I'll be your internet girlfriend.

1418
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:12,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me gold.

1419
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:14,642
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're like, Okay, that's pretty cool.

1420
01:22:14,982 --> 01:22:16,502
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, Sweet, I have a twink now.

1421
01:22:16,622 --> 01:22:17,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

1422
01:22:18,123 --> 01:22:19,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice knowing you.

1423
01:22:19,443 --> 01:22:22,044
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm not really like that all the time.

1424
01:22:22,565 --> 01:22:25,286
[SPEAKER_12]: But, yeah, that's what a twink is.

1425
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:28,147
[SPEAKER_12]: That was education.

1426
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:29,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to explain what a gay twink is.

1427
01:22:29,547 --> 01:22:30,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Look it up on Wikipedia.

1428
01:22:30,507 --> 01:22:30,668
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1429
01:22:30,688 --> 01:22:30,788
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1430
01:22:33,103 --> 01:22:34,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and isn't that so cool?

1431
01:22:35,244 --> 01:22:39,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you could be a guy and just have a really high-pitched voice and be like, Hi!

1432
01:22:40,225 --> 01:22:42,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, they have a Valentine's Day event going on right now.

1433
01:22:42,446 --> 01:22:42,966
[SPEAKER_07]: They do?

1434
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:47,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was trying to have my girl hit on other girls, but I didn't.

1435
01:22:48,388 --> 01:22:49,468
[SPEAKER_12]: You were trying to be a lesbian?

1436
01:22:49,588 --> 01:22:50,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's fun.

1437
01:22:50,388 --> 01:22:51,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Lesbians are fun.

1438
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:53,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you're supposed to hit on guys and they'll give you money.

1439
01:22:54,509 --> 01:22:56,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, I ended up hitting on guys because I screwed up.

1440
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:59,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the wrong thing, so I just decided to play it straight.

1441
01:22:59,827 --> 01:23:02,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Beatmania and Virtual Console Games Who said you could call?

1442
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:22,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I paid Loki five bucks.

1443
01:23:22,785 --> 01:23:23,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it must be DMN.

1444
01:23:24,005 --> 01:23:24,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, DMN.

1445
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:25,086
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

1446
01:23:25,586 --> 01:23:26,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing pretty good.

1447
01:23:26,707 --> 01:23:30,729
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are talking about, uh... Wait, DMN, you've been a long-time listener of the show, right?

1448
01:23:31,209 --> 01:23:31,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1449
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Is tonight a good show or a bad show?

1450
01:23:33,271 --> 01:23:33,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Be honest.

1451
01:23:34,251 --> 01:23:35,712
[SPEAKER_08]: God, this show's hilarious.

1452
01:23:35,732 --> 01:23:36,672
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?

1453
01:23:37,273 --> 01:23:37,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1454
01:23:37,593 --> 01:23:37,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Winner!

1455
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:38,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1456
01:23:39,034 --> 01:23:39,474
[SPEAKER_12]: The winner's me.

1457
01:23:39,574 --> 01:23:40,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Heart!

1458
01:23:40,275 --> 01:23:40,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Level up!

1459
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:43,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do!

1460
01:23:44,197 --> 01:23:45,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, sorry, I just gained five stamina.

1461
01:23:46,518 --> 01:23:49,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, what's... I'm sorry, you want Beatmania, Wii, what?

1462
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:49,900
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1463
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:54,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you guys were talking about the Beatmania location test in Illinois.

1464
01:23:55,263 --> 01:24:03,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm almost wondering if that's a precursor to the oft-rumored, talked-about Beatmania sequel coming to the consoles.

1465
01:24:04,965 --> 01:24:19,889
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but we didn't see it at Gamers Day, which is a little bit of a, you know, it's not going to happen, but it is a little bit of a frowny face next to the idea, you know, because they did announce Beatmania 1 at Gamers Day last year, so, I mean, I would say it's still up in the air.

1466
01:24:20,492 --> 01:24:21,713
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not familiar with Gamers Day.

1467
01:24:21,733 --> 01:24:24,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they announce Supernova CS?

1468
01:24:25,054 --> 01:24:30,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, we only ran about four stories on Gamers Day on the site, so I urge you to check out OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1469
01:24:31,536 --> 01:24:32,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, look at the website, kids.

1470
01:24:33,757 --> 01:24:35,178
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you want to know about Gamers Day?

1471
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:38,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Was Supernova CS announced last year?

1472
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:40,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

1473
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:43,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it may not have been.

1474
01:24:43,261 --> 01:24:43,981
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have me there.

1475
01:24:44,081 --> 01:24:45,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they did announce it.

1476
01:24:45,802 --> 01:24:47,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they were showing Beatmania...

1477
01:24:48,777 --> 01:24:52,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, and it was the Karaoke Revolution Country.

1478
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:54,102
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't show Supernova until E3.

1479
01:24:54,663 --> 01:24:57,565
[SPEAKER_05]: They have that arcade machine there, and they announced Supernova for the console.

1480
01:24:57,585 --> 01:24:58,726
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, that's right.

1481
01:24:58,746 --> 01:25:01,909
[SPEAKER_07]: They made the announcement of Supernova in the arcades at Gamers Day last year.

1482
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,551
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they said the consoles too, I think.

1483
01:25:03,711 --> 01:25:07,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, and they said it was going to come to consoles, but they just didn't show the playable game.

1484
01:25:08,175 --> 01:25:11,398
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, because Loki and I were toot our own horn here.

1485
01:25:11,438 --> 01:25:13,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the first people in the country to play DDR Supernova.

1486
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1487
01:25:15,205 --> 01:25:17,046
[SPEAKER_12]: You didn't have to do the arm gestures, Ross.

1488
01:25:17,107 --> 01:25:17,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants to touch me?

1489
01:25:18,087 --> 01:25:19,148
[SPEAKER_12]: You look like you're trying to fly away.

1490
01:25:19,168 --> 01:25:20,389
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that was a steel-toed boot.

1491
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:23,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so... I wouldn't wash that hand, by the way.

1492
01:25:25,853 --> 01:25:25,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Ew.

1493
01:25:28,555 --> 01:25:32,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Sephiroth1215 says the last consumer DDR shown at Gamers Day was extreme.

1494
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there you go.

1495
01:25:36,301 --> 01:25:42,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, going back, I know Eddie was talking about how virtual console games are priced, you know, so expensively.

1496
01:25:42,867 --> 01:25:43,327
[SPEAKER_08]: He sure was.

1497
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:47,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I could have put that on the N64 games.

1498
01:25:47,956 --> 01:25:52,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I think $10 is stupid, especially since that system blew.

1499
01:25:52,298 --> 01:25:54,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Pokemon Snap, motherfucker!

1500
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd pay $10 for that.

1501
01:25:55,881 --> 01:26:00,304
[SPEAKER_01]: About a year ago, they were announcing they were considering maybe having all the NES games be free.

1502
01:26:00,524 --> 01:26:02,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I don't see why that would have been out of the question.

1503
01:26:02,945 --> 01:26:05,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like you said, the games were like 20 years old.

1504
01:26:05,687 --> 01:26:08,049
[SPEAKER_01]: They made their money off of them, and now it's like they're selling bits.

1505
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And I could go buy Animal Crossing and get half those games for free.

1506
01:26:12,392 --> 01:26:12,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1507
01:26:12,812 --> 01:26:12,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1508
01:26:13,993 --> 01:26:19,077
[SPEAKER_08]: But I honestly think that $8 for SNES games is a pretty fair price.

1509
01:26:19,217 --> 01:26:21,979
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'd gladly pay $8 for Linkin Park.

1510
01:26:22,019 --> 01:26:22,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Eddie disagrees.

1511
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:23,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you disagree?

1512
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree, too.

1513
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:24,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1514
01:26:24,821 --> 01:26:25,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you guys are poor.

1515
01:26:27,422 --> 01:26:28,123
[SPEAKER_01]: In part, yes.

1516
01:26:28,363 --> 01:26:29,724
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, it's just the whole thing.

1517
01:26:29,744 --> 01:26:36,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand they have to pay for setting up for the retro console, but they don't have to pay for actually making cartridges, sending them out, shipping them out.

1518
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:39,331
[SPEAKER_07]: What if, like, they charge, like, one fee...

1519
01:26:39,935 --> 01:26:40,696
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1520
01:27:02,341 --> 01:27:03,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Retro Reasons or whatever.

1521
01:27:03,442 --> 01:27:05,523
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not like we really want to obtain the game.

1522
01:27:06,084 --> 01:27:08,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, Nintendo's trying to target that new generation.

1523
01:27:09,506 --> 01:27:12,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Half of the people who may be playing the Wii have never even played these games before.

1524
01:27:13,308 --> 01:27:13,569
[SPEAKER_12]: True.

1525
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:15,190
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

1526
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:15,410
[SPEAKER_07]: True dat.

1527
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:17,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Doesn't mean they have to charge so much fucking money for it.

1528
01:27:18,012 --> 01:27:26,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, though, I notice a lot of people that are getting into the Wii kind of like remember the old NES, like the old Mario Brothers and that stuff.

1529
01:27:26,477 --> 01:27:28,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, you know, there's a certain nostalgia value to it, too.

1530
01:27:29,924 --> 01:27:30,925
[SPEAKER_07]: DM, anything else for our listeners?

1531
01:27:30,965 --> 01:27:31,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1532
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:00,131
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100, Matt's going to be on STFU this week.

1533
01:28:00,151 --> 01:28:00,751
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

1534
01:28:00,991 --> 01:28:01,692
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be fun.

1535
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,152
[SPEAKER_07]: STFU, Thursday nights, right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1536
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I heard Jimmy was on Cross Platform this week.

1537
01:28:07,614 --> 01:28:07,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard.

1538
01:28:08,034 --> 01:28:09,834
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't tell me until a couple days ago.

1539
01:28:10,194 --> 01:28:15,716
[SPEAKER_07]: How is it that you guys have accomplished more in 11, 12 weeks of your program than we've accomplished in five years?

1540
01:28:18,817 --> 01:28:20,138
[SPEAKER_08]: We model your work ethic.

1541
01:28:20,718 --> 01:28:22,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear DMN, I hate you.

1542
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:22,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Love, Rob.

1543
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:24,279
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, you don't.

1544
01:28:24,559 --> 01:28:25,139
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right, I don't.

1545
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:26,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Hugs and kisses, DMN.

1546
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:26,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't be a dick.

1547
01:28:29,016 --> 01:28:29,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

1548
01:28:30,437 --> 01:28:30,718
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1549
01:28:31,718 --> 01:28:37,382
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I'm going to make a show that counters STFU and it's going to be called DIAF.

1550
01:28:38,543 --> 01:28:39,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Diet of Fire?

1551
01:28:39,263 --> 01:28:39,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1552
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,184
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll be good.

1553
01:28:40,344 --> 01:28:42,666
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just going to be setting people on fire.

1554
01:28:42,726 --> 01:28:43,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

1555
01:28:44,187 --> 01:28:44,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Last minute stories.

1556
01:28:44,927 --> 01:28:46,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around and get the last minute stories.

1557
01:28:46,308 --> 01:28:47,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody have anything they want to share?

1558
01:28:47,669 --> 01:28:47,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1559
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:49,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, StarkSakura.

1560
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:49,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Rondo of Blood!

1561
01:28:52,915 --> 01:28:56,758
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura will not be seen on next week's program, or any program afterwards, actually.

1562
01:28:56,918 --> 01:28:59,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she'll be playing Rondo of Blood.

1563
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I did have something, though, off-topic.

1564
01:29:01,562 --> 01:29:05,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually not going to be able to be live Tuesday, but the Tuesday after I will be.

1565
01:29:06,085 --> 01:29:06,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

1566
01:29:06,545 --> 01:29:07,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my midterms.

1567
01:29:07,786 --> 01:29:09,408
[SPEAKER_07]: More Pump Up the Volume, goodness.

1568
01:29:09,668 --> 01:29:11,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Pump Up the Volume will be back the week after next.

1569
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:12,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1570
01:29:13,511 --> 01:29:14,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you have anything last minute?

1571
01:29:15,372 --> 01:29:16,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, nothing.

1572
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:16,833
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a first.

1573
01:29:17,254 --> 01:29:17,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

1574
01:29:18,455 --> 01:29:20,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't have anything either, so I guess that's it.

1575
01:29:20,656 --> 01:29:22,238
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1576
01:29:22,258 --> 01:29:22,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Down the crapper.

1577
01:29:24,212 --> 01:29:27,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

1578
01:29:27,994 --> 01:29:28,554
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys rock.

1579
01:29:29,095 --> 01:29:30,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1580
01:29:31,016 --> 01:29:32,537
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start off with our special guest tonight.

1581
01:29:32,577 --> 01:29:33,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for being here.

1582
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:34,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess, your final thought.

1583
01:29:39,101 --> 01:29:40,402
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a queef, not a fart.

1584
01:29:40,782 --> 01:29:41,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you for clarifying.

1585
01:29:41,863 --> 01:29:43,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1586
01:29:44,224 --> 01:29:46,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Casper the Gay, also known as Eddie, your final thought.

1587
01:29:46,666 --> 01:29:49,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, don't join Rob's FaceSite thing.

1588
01:29:49,528 --> 01:29:51,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Join my MySpace at W-I-I-D-D-Y.

1589
01:29:52,785 --> 01:29:53,085
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1590
01:29:54,566 --> 01:29:54,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

1591
01:29:56,047 --> 01:29:57,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Weed, I get it.

1592
01:29:57,488 --> 01:30:00,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Weed D. I get it, because like Eddie, but Weed.

1593
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:02,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I'm really gay.

1594
01:30:02,612 --> 01:30:04,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us, Rob.

1595
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:08,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought, and what are you shopping for on eBay right now?

1596
01:30:08,616 --> 01:30:15,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Analog replacement for my new PSP that I'm going to be getting, since I want to repair it by Wednesday, so.

1597
01:30:16,422 --> 01:30:21,245
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is, God, I wish Crackdown was out this week, but I have to wait another week.

1598
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:22,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo.

1599
01:30:24,178 --> 01:30:30,860
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is reject false icons and I heart you, Jamie.

1600
01:30:32,521 --> 01:30:33,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, your final thought.

1601
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:35,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Bondo of blood!

1602
01:30:36,682 --> 01:30:39,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And my other obsession right now is Captain America.

1603
01:30:40,023 --> 01:30:40,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great night, everybody.

1604
01:30:40,944 --> 01:30:43,084
