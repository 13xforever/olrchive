00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,360
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 219 for this February the 11th of 2007.

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,200
If you're downloading this on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, welcome to the program.

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,360
Keep in mind we tape this live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

4
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,400
You can hear the show rebroadcast in its entirety before it hits the podcast stream at allgames.com

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,800
Monday nights at 530 Pacific and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m. Pacific, or you can just wait until

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,080
Wednesday or Thursday-ish when the show Part B makes it to the audio archive, whatever

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
works for you.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,480
See, Orange Lounge Radio, we have multiple ways to get you the show that you've come

9
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,360
to listen to, and we thank you for tuning into and supporting our program.

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,440
You supporting independent radio are a real winner.

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,480
Rob, where's the tape recorder that you're taping the show on?

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
It's all in my brain.

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
In the 80s?

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,800
Back in the day, I used scripts for all this stuff.

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I don't even use them.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
It's all in my brain.

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,880
I think your tape recorder is in the 80s where it belongs.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
By the way, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, it is a little bit

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,540
of an off night tonight, and I blame our guests.

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,280
But Dark Soccer is going to rescue us with some gaming news.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
I don't want to.

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
You must.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Help.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
You're our only help.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Okay, how about this?

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
It's movie news.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
That works.

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,520
As long as it's not Uwe Boll.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Shut up!

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,280
Yes, it's going to be one of those shows tonight.

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Rob.

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
What?

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Rob.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
What?

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Rob.

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
I quit.

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Okay, so Sony.

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Good, my show now.

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,760
Hi, you're listening to Jamie Lounge Radio.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
No.

41
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,920
Did you hear that?

42
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,560
That's the sound of a thousand people unsubscribing.

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
There you go.

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
You know what?

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,880
That's the sound of my finger raised in tribute to you.

46
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Video game news.

47
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Do we ever do it on this program?

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,360
Sony is making a Metal Gear movie produced by, was it the one who's producing the Ghost

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,580
Rider movie?

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,280
That is very cool stuff.

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:28,240
It was actually announced by Studio Kojima at last E3 and basically as far as what's

52
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:39,200
been quoted is that it's going to be a very, okay, this makes no sense.

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,760
They're talking about a cinematic game, but they were talking about a movie.

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
I don't get it.

55
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, because Metal Gear Solid is a very cinematic game.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,600
So basically they're saying because it's a cinematic.

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
Oh, I misread it.

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
That was me.

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,640
Yeah, because it's a very cinematic game, it lends itself to a movie very simply.

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Very well.

61
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Yeah.

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Yeah.

63
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,600
I completely, apparently I forgot how to read in my weekend area.

64
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,320
That's why we're only, you know, that's why we're amateur radio.

65
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,200
That's why we don't get paid for this.

66
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Whatever.

67
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,360
Don't make me feel worse.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Anyway.

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,800
But yeah, I'm actually voting for the ride in sequel.

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
The ride in sequel?

71
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Yeah.

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
What?

73
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
UFO ending?

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
What?

75
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
No.

76
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Dog ending?

77
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
No.

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
That's the Silent Helmet movie, not Metal Gear.

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,640
So does that mean we're going to speculate about who's going to be playing all of the

80
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,520
roles in the movie?

81
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,800
Well garsh, Rice Princess, if you were to cast the Metal Gear Solid movie, who would

82
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,200
you cast in the role of Snake?

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
A snake?

84
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,520
No, I would cast, why can I not?

85
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,960
Matt Damon, because he plays everybody.

86
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Or Ben Affleck.

87
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Matt Damon.

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Ben Affleck.

89
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Ben Affleck.

90
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,480
Because apparently people think that he's such a universal actor that he can play any

91
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
role ever.

92
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,960
No, I know, I know who I want it to be.

93
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
The guy who's his voice actor.

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
David Tennant?

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
No, David Hayter.

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Ah.

97
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,360
Yeah, okay, I'm pulling up pictures of him and he's actually really cute and he would

98
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,040
actually make a good snake.

99
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,580
See here he is.

100
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,620
As long as Loki plays- I'm going to send it to the chat room.

101
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,500
As long as Loki plays the role of Tingle.

102
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
That's according to GS68.

103
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,880
Well no, because keep in mind, David Hayter, actually David Hayter wrote the first two

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,040
X-Men movies, but he was also Solid Snake's voice actor, plus he's pretty freaking, he

105
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,600
looks kind of like Snake too.

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,140
DJ Jenai wins.

107
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,440
He says Paul Reubens should play Snake.

108
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,800
Yeah, apparently it's the Hollywood Reporter saying that Columbia Pictures is now currently

109
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,360
negotiating the rights to mill your solid- Columbia is owned by Sony, so not a big surprise

110
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
there.

111
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,320
Anyways, what is kind of a big surprise though is Rockstar's brand new game, Manhunt 2, is

112
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,080
coming to the Wii as well as Playstation 2 and PSP.

113
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,000
For those who didn't play Manhunt 1, in Manhunt you actually play a psychopathic killer who

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,480
has basically egged on to kill people in very violent ways, using everything from trash

115
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:38,280
bags to shards of glass, and well, I guess we will actually get a murder simulator, which

116
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,120
is awesome, and it's going to be very violent.

117
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,640
Wait, so you can use a trash bag to kill someone?

118
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,720
Yes, and it's great because you can use- Let's demonstrate in studio how that's done.

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,600
Irene, if you would just sit still for a minute.

120
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,860
Just kidding, we here at Orange Laundry do not endorse the actual killing of actual people.

121
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:04,360
And then of course this got announced on February 6th, which just so happened, ironically enough,

122
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,880
and I'm sure this is just pure coincidence, happened to be the anniversary of apparently

123
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:19,660
a murder that was sought to be blamed on the original Manhunt game apparently.

124
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:29,800
There was a 2004 incident where a kid, Steven Pacara, age 14, was murdered by his friend

125
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,320
Warren LeBlanc, age 17, and of course they blamed the actions on the game, which was

126
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,560
later disproved in court, but parents either way are still kind of pissed off that they

127
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,400
made this announcement on the anniversary of that.

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Hooray!

129
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,040
More murder games!

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,360
I love this, and fuck those parents.

131
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Those parents are just jealous that they didn't think of it first.

132
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
So you know what?

133
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,880
Manhunt 2, hell yes.

134
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
Wow.

135
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,600
I apologize if I mispronounce this name.

136
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:08,640
Kai Hate Wireless says, Manhunt 2 will get Wii recalls at Walmarts and Targets nationwide.

137
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,760
Mike W says, murder games suck.

138
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Raven's Dolphin says, Manhunt for the Wii.

139
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,040
For the win, FTW.

140
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,400
Well, we shall see.

141
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,320
Is Manhunt 2 a game that interests you?

142
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,040
Dark Soccer, because you said earlier in the program you want games with more blood and

143
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,560
more violence, and I don't know, killing people with a trash bag with your Wii mote.

144
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,880
I think that that would be a very interesting place to time.

145
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,760
I think that it should be Ultimate PMS Revenge, the game.

146
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Alright.

147
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,600
She just doesn't like the title because it has man in it.

148
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,760
Well, no, because that could also be women taking revenge off of male oppression.

149
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,240
What if they called it Man Cunt?

150
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,640
Would that appeal to you then?

151
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,080
No, because then I'd start thinking of someone who's pre-op transgendered or something.

152
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Oh, god, I just threw up in my mouth.

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:04,120
Let's switch topics to a Zorro game on the way to the Wii.

154
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,440
Pronto Games is going to be bringing the destiny of Zorro to the Wii this holiday season.

155
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,040
This was announced by Pronto Games.

156
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,320
Pronto President and Creative Director Randy Angle said they hope to bring the player,

157
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
quote, fully into the moment of Zoroness.

158
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,400
This game is currently planned as a Wii exclusive.

159
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
You know what that is?

160
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,280
I swear to god, that's a quote.

161
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Fully into the moment of Zoroness.

162
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,780
Ron, you have killed Irene.

163
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,940
She is laughing to death.

164
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
That's what it says.

165
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,400
What would that be, like the 1920s?

166
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,960
You all know that with that wiimote, you're going to have to do that stupid make a Z with

167
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,000
your wiimote.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,240
How many times in the game do you think you're going to be required to go with a wiimote?

169
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,760
I think that's the only point of the game.

170
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
That's what you do.

171
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,080
The objective is you try to make the Z.

172
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
That's the game.

173
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,600
That's how you fully embrace the Zoroness, is pfft, pfft, pfft.

174
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,120
Yeah, and at the same time, you can fully embrace the Zoroness for buying the game.

175
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
You know, they call him the gay blade.

176
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,760
Oh, really?

177
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,360
DJ, it's a new Zor...

178
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Whatever.

179
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,480
DJ Jenai says, Zo, really?

180
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,320
It's like this, Rob, it's just, it's like...

181
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,360
Three snaps in Z formation?

182
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,920
Did Loki just do three snaps in Z formation?

183
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,560
I think that he did.

184
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Slash, slash, slash.

185
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
What's going on?

186
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,140
I give this game two snaps, a twist, and a kiss.

187
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,440
I would not be buying this game.

188
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
This is the single gayest show we've ever done.

189
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
By the way, if...

190
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,000
It's so gay that they'll be downloading rainbows.

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,560
By the way, if you are listening for the first time, and you're like, that's wrong, I'm gonna

192
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,960
call GLAAD on these people.

193
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,440
Two of us are gay, so it's okay that we make these jokes.

194
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,400
Me being one of them, Eddie the Gay being the other.

195
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
So just...

196
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,120
Casper the Gay, Eddie the Gay, whatever, you're gay.

197
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Gay the Gay.

198
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,360
Gay the gayest gay that ever gayed with his gay blade on the Zorro gay game.

199
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
I can really...

200
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
DT said I just won the internet.

201
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Except for Rob.

202
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,800
Dude, when I ever eat breakfast, I poop out the internet, so don't worry about that.

203
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,680
Have you mastered your gay blade, Eddie?

204
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,160
Rob has the gay blade, and he bought it at Disneyland.

205
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,040
Let's go back to video game news, shall we?

206
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Before we lose.

207
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,160
Tonight, it's how many subscribers can we lose?

208
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Speaking of gay, I'm sorry.

209
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Transformers.

210
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,200
How about some news about Transformers?

211
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,280
There's a Transformers game being put out by Activision on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PS2,

212
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
and PC.

213
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,720
That's a lot of P's trying to say that five times fast.

214
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,120
We have the PSP and DS versions that are going to be handled by Savage and Vicarious Visions.

215
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,200
Wait, they're going to be handled by a Savage?

216
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,880
The Transformers are being handled, you know.

217
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,280
I figured if we could have a transforming tape deck, we could have a vibrator.

218
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,280
And that will get me to another topic today, because I actually looked at the Transformers

219
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,480
movie poster today and about cried.

220
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,120
Yeah, it's actually being handled by Randy Macho Man Savage.

221
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Oh, yeah!

222
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Snap into a Transformer!

223
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,800
That was awful!

224
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
I love that he plays Space Ghost Grandpa.

225
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Oh, yeah!

226
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
On Space Ghost Ghost to Ghost.

227
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,560
I will actually be doing the rest of the night as Randy Macho Man Savage.

228
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Oh, yeah!

229
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
You can't know, Rob.

230
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Oh, no!

231
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Oh, no!

232
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Naughty, naughty, Kool-Aid!

233
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,640
So when are you going to start, Rob?

234
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Because that's awful.

235
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,600
So how about that Transformers game, huh?

236
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Sure.

237
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,800
The Transformers game, you'll be able to either play as an Autobot or Decepticon, and you

238
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,880
would have to master each character's weapon, moves, transformations, and you'd have to

239
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,520
be able to switch between the, of course, vehicle and robot mode.

240
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,920
You can tear up the world around you, you can smash shit, and you can blow shit up.

241
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,320
And that makes it an awesome game already.

242
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Woo-hoo!

243
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:26,720
Traveler's Tales, by the way, I believe that they are the ones releasing it.

244
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,260
They also had that Lego Star Wars game.

245
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,680
And also had that stupid Bionicle game, as well.

246
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,200
But the Lego Star Wars game was fun.

247
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Perhaps Lego Transformers?

248
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
No?

249
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:45,960
I don't know, but I freaking saw that poster today and wanted to cry again, but I am going

250
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
to see Ghostwriter.

251
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:58,040
Anyways, so the PSP, they just updated the firmware from 3.10 to 3.11, adding brand new

252
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:06,080
functionality like a fix to some of the R-Type games and a reset button for the emulator.

253
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,340
And well, as you might have guessed, as soon as they got it released out there to the world,

254
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,980
it was cracked and broken apart, and yeah, yet another firmware that's been released

255
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,240
by Sony and cracked the same day.

256
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,400
So hooray, your attempts at foiling homebrew have failed yet again.

257
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
I don't even care.

258
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,960
Did you say that this is version 3.1.1?

259
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
3.1.1.

260
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:49,920
Someone cracked our system, down, down, they took it down, down, down, down, sorry.

261
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,940
You know what, it's one of those shows, this is 3.1.1, the last three reviews that we've

262
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,900
had on the station.

263
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,000
This is the show we're submitting to the Podcast Emmys, by the way, just so you know.

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,080
Vote for us on Digg and Podcast Allie, and tell them you loved episode 219.

265
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:20,400
Anyhow, Will Wheaton, who can save a show, but who doesn't love Will Wheaton?

266
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,640
Oh my God, Will Wheaton is awesome.

267
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,440
Will Wheaton blogged this week on suicidegirls.com, and he was blogging about the arcades.

268
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,680
I urge you to check this out, it was one of those reminiscing posts, he's talking about

269
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,280
how he loves the arcades, and he loved the arcades back in the 80s, and he asked himself,

270
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,320
what happens to the arcades?

271
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,380
And he talks about, well, he thinks that because of PC gaming, and now he can spend 40 bucks

272
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,280
to play a game at home, why would you spend a dollar on a game now?

273
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,760
But what I thought was most interesting about this is his perspective on what should they

274
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
do?

275
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,240
And he thought in the last paragraph of his statement here, he thinks that some billionaire

276
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,120
should come out and open a chain of classic 1980 videos arcades, complete with the Journey

277
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,840
game and Rush on the Jukebox, more reasons why I love Will Wheaton, by the way, love

278
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,480
him, and that you get five tokens for a dollar, and he says, why not?

279
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,000
You had a resurgence of 50s diners in the 80s, so why not a resurgence of classic 80s

280
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,160
arcades in the new millennium?

281
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
What do you think?

282
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,360
If they opened up a classic 80s arcade, would you go and would you patronize it?

283
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah, or I could play MAME in my garage.

284
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,280
Well, if they had the Journey game, I wouldn't.

285
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,120
I would be camped out in front of the machine all day.

286
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
I would have the high score.

287
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,480
No, the Journey game is awesome.

288
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,600
The Journey game is awesome.

289
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,020
But you know what?

290
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,160
You know where you get to play that is a classic gaming expo?

291
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,080
They need to have like food there too, though.

292
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,720
It would have to be like old school Chuck E. Cheese, you know, back there.

293
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,280
Isn't that kind of what Dave & Buster's is, though?

294
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Sort of, yeah.

295
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Yeah.

296
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,480
But Dave & Buster's is way damn expensive.

297
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,040
I mean, they have just way too many ticket games there that cost way too much to win

298
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,000
prizes that are, you know, okay, more expensive, but still, they have to spend more money.

299
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So I don't know.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hold on.

301
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
I have to set the mood here a little bit.

302
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:16,280
Oh, yeah, this shit takes me back to the days of Asteroids and Ms. Pac-Man.

303
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,640
Can you imagine walking into an arcade and you got Journey blasting on the...

304
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,800
Man, this takes me back.

305
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
You love this song.

306
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
You know it.

307
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,200
You just don't want to admit it, right, Princess?

308
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,120
Anyhow, well, we've welcomed Wil Wheaton's opinion onto the program.

309
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,400
How about your opinion?

310
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,740
You guys send us emails every week to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and last week we

311
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,360
complained we didn't get enough emails, so I think we actually got quite a few more emails

312
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,060
this week, so we're very proud of the listeners.

313
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,880
We hope we get more next week, so mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

314
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,080
You hope we get more.

315
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,880
Let's get Dark Sakura to open up the mailbag and read some emails.

316
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:05,080
Email, email, email, checking the email.

317
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,360
First one comes from Apollo-chan saying, hey there, Dark Sakura.

318
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Oh, it's to me.

319
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Wow.

320
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
I hope all is well with you and the rest of the crew.

321
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,280
I was just curious if you or any of the other members of the OLR crew happen to have a Facebook

322
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,480
account.

323
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,420
If you are not familiar with Facebook, think MySpace, except less tacky and more respectable

324
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
atmosphere.

325
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,560
It began as a university-only networking site, but now it's open to everyone.

326
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,280
If you all are not members, I would like to suggest that you at least give it a look.

327
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,720
Also, there's an OLR Facebook group called Orange Dodge Radio Fans, the OLR me, that

328
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,120
I started a while ago, and I just thought it might be good to let you all know in case

329
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,240
you weren't aware.

330
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,920
That way, you could better promote it.

331
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,120
Just another vessel for spreading the OLR gospel.

332
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,940
Love, love, love the show.

333
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,800
You all make me amazingly happy, so keep up the good work and have a great week, Apollo.

334
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,960
PS, I'm sure you all will be talking about the 2DX testing in Illinois on next week's

335
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
show.

336
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Isn't that super exciting?

337
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
There you go.

338
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,800
You listen to part A. I'm excited, but I don't think it's going to catch, but we'll see.

339
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
It's better than nothing.

340
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,860
Well, I signed up for a Facebook account just for this, and I'd heard about Facebook before

341
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,960
because I have friends that are still in college, like one of my really good friends, his sister.

342
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,920
We're all on Facebook at the college there.

343
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
She goes to Vassar, and every single student there, I think, has a Facebook account.

344
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,680
Isn't that like a textile college?

345
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,080
No, no, no, no.

346
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,160
I think it was a woman's college back in the day, but it's a very pretty campus, though,

347
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
but that's regardless.

348
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,440
Does anyone from Vassar listen to the program?

349
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
You should send me an email.

350
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,200
I actually was there a couple months ago.

351
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,280
Anyway, that's not the point.

352
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,360
The point is we have an Orange Lounge Radio community on Facebook, and you can find it

353
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,000
by searching for Orange Lounge Radio, and I actually signed up for a Facebook account,

354
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,960
and yeah, it's kind of like Myspace without the page customization and all that weird

355
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,560
stuff that brings Myspace to a strange level, but what I think is really interesting is

356
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,680
that you update people of your status.

357
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,620
So for those of you that remember Jonas, aka Explicit, that came onto this program, he's

358
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,720
on my friend's page, and it told me last night, Jonas is out at a party, and I was like, wow,

359
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,040
that's amazing that the internet tells me these things.

360
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,960
Amazing what the internet has accomplished.

361
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,200
I think it's awesome that somebody else created this community and that people were already

362
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,880
joining it before we even got an email on it.

363
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,280
So big hug and kisses to you guys out there.

364
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,560
Well, our next email actually comes from, let me see, from Stacy.

365
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,320
It says, hello, I've been listening to the Orange Lounge station for about a week now,

366
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,960
and I have a question about the playlist.

367
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,000
It seems that the majority of the songs are from DDR or BeatMania or from other similar

368
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
games.

369
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,140
There were very few, very, very few songs that weren't dance, eurobeat, et cetera.

370
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,340
Why is it advertised as a station dedicated to video games when there's no bias toward

371
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,880
dance type games?

372
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
From what I read on the site, I understand that it started out as being a tribute to

373
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,800
those kinds of games, but now, aside from the shows, there's very little to distinguish

374
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,200
it from the typical dance station.

375
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,660
So if this sounds like an attack, it really is, and I'm generally curious about this.

376
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,000
I think we just haven't filtered out a lot of the old stuff.

377
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah.

378
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,180
That's the majority of the stuff, because they were all there before.

379
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,620
To be honest, well, we did do a pretty big reshuffle when we went to MP3 Pro about a

380
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:08,520
year and a half ago, but I think that's what's been high rated, and there are other places

381
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,120
out there where you can hear just regular gaming music, but I find that a lot of the

382
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,700
orchestral gaming music can kind of be like, not that it's bad or anything, but without

383
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,960
the game there, it doesn't make for the most entertaining radio.

384
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,800
We try to keep the music that's in our rotation upbeat a little more, but certainly it could

385
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,160
use some help in getting the music buffed up with some other picks that are very upbeat.

386
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,020
So certainly we welcome your suggestions on music we could add to the stream.

387
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,520
The really bizarre stuff was from me, by the way.

388
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,060
Keep in mind, though, we still feel justified in calling ourselves radio dedicated to video

389
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,400
gaming because of the live shows that we do, which is really the focus of the station.

390
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,640
I have to be honest, even though the 24-7 music program is what's there most of the

391
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,280
time, it's actually the lowest on our priority chain.

392
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,540
We're more into bringing you guys the live interactive stuff than just a bunch of MP3s

393
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,080
on shuffle, to be honest.

394
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,520
So we're glad that somebody is listening to live stream, though, and caring, and certainly

395
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,960
we'll take another look at what's in rotation and maybe try to liven it up a little.

396
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:20,480
Next email comes from XenionELDDR, this is my first time writing, and first of all, I

397
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,480
want to say that your show is awesome and continue the good work.

398
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Smiley.

399
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,120
Well, the reason I am writing is because I have a question on a certain comedy game that

400
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,680
has piqued my interest as of late, as learning if Konami's Oz will ever be released in America.

401
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,880
I know that the game is about a year and a half old, but I've seen YouTube video with

402
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,520
an English dubbed French, I think text version of the game, and I think that they would try

403
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,080
to put English text in the game because I, for one, would wait until they were done putting

404
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,200
the text in and buy it with no questions asked.

405
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,440
I also ask this because I'm considering buying the import version if it does not make it

406
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,000
overseas, or if there is a way to try to persuade Konami of America to releasing it over here,

407
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,400
because I need to buy an import PS2, and if not, as you can really see, I want this game,

408
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,720
but not only because this is a run-on sentence that's never-ending, this game, but I've always

409
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,640
wanted to try out popin' music and other 2DX games besides the English one I own.

410
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Period!

411
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Thank you.

412
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,120
Hopefully you can help me out, and thank you for taking the time to read this email.

413
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,320
Again, your show rules.

414
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Thank you.

415
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,840
That was a really big, freaking long run-up.

416
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,720
I'm not trying to poke or anything, it's just like...

417
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
That's why no one emails us.

418
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Punctuation!

419
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Tell me when I can take a breath.

420
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,800
Pause on PlayStation 2 is not going to come out in this country, and I don't think there's

421
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,760
a lot that can be done at this point because PlayStation 2 is slowly being phased out,

422
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,440
so unfortunately you're probably going to have to import that one.

423
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,480
But I don't think it's ever a bad idea to certainly petition the game makers for the

424
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,360
games you want to see.

425
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,520
Send emails, let them know.

426
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,100
I know a company like Konami, they're somewhat out there reading some of the stuff out there

427
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,520
on the internet, so I'm not saying you should go on a board and bitch about it, but send

428
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
emails.

429
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
They do care.

430
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,720
And that goes with any gaming company, not just Konami, but any gaming company.

431
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,320
Let them know, you want to see it here.

432
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:12,460
The next one is actually a link that was sent to us by JeremyTodd1, which I think is actually

433
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,920
pretty cool.

434
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,320
Apparently the folks at Xbox Magazine used Miis for the staff picture, so they were doing

435
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,080
their nod toward Nintendo, and it actually is...

436
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:36,880
If you go to gonintendo.com slash wp-content slash photos slash miioxm.jpg, you can see

437
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
the image.

438
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,280
It's been the last two issues.

439
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,680
Unfortunately I get the magazine.

440
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,840
Originally I signed up for it to get demos because I was like, ooh, ooh, you know, time

441
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
shift demo.

442
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
That's not out yet.

443
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,920
Unfortunately the last few demos have all been crap, so that kind of sucks.

444
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,360
Well why the sudden appearance of Miis in the magazine?

445
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,560
Is that just furthering that odd affection that Microsoft has for Nintendo right now,

446
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
like all these subtle comments?

447
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,200
They want to recreate pictures of themselves.

448
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,520
But using your competitors, because essentially Nintendo is still their competitor, because

449
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,840
even though Microsoft might have somehow embraced this Wii 16, I mean, it's odd because you

450
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,500
see Major Nelson says nice things about the Wii in his blog, Trixie, I've read her thing

451
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,400
on xbox.com, she said nice things about the Wii at one point, and it's kind of like Microsoft

452
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,160
kind of has this professional respect for the Wii, but that doesn't seem to be reciprocated

453
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
by Nintendo.

454
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,400
I mean, there might be a respect, but Reggie has flat out said, don't buy a 360, buy more

455
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,960
Wii games, essentially, in so many words.

456
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,360
So it's just kind of interesting that Microsoft keeps handing these olive branches over to

457
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,440
Nintendo, like, hey, let's fight Sony together.

458
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Weird.

459
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,960
I think that maybe they're just trying to screw with the consumer's heads.

460
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,240
GS68 in our chat room says, come on, Reggie, make love, not war.

461
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,840
So how about the next email, huh?

462
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
How about it?

463
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,880
Dear OLR, Hi guys, DDR Dollar Bill here, and probably changing my name in the future, long

464
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
story.

465
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,280
In spirit, as long as I'm not going to be in the chat room on Sunday, my crazy self

466
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,400
is in Vegas doing some partying with my family and probably a few hundred crazies.

467
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Lucky.

468
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,360
But I do have one thing I'd like to ask.

469
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,240
While I was making my pre-reserve for DDR Universe, I had a glance at the future release's

470
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
date list.

471
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Even took home a copy, it helps knowing friends at GameStop, and sell Guitar Hero 2.

472
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,000
Now, I know this is most likely will be a port of the PS2, but we had a discussion about

473
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,400
the rumor of Guitar Hero having a future release of all 80 songs.

474
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,000
True or not, it did get me thinking, would having music games concentrate on a certain

475
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
genre make them more appealing to the mass market?

476
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,560
Would it also make it more interesting for those already addicted to the games themselves?

477
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,800
It's just my thought of the week.

478
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Anyhoo, there's my $2 to the show, I hope you all have fun, and it goes to the chat

479
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,920
room buddies as well.

480
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
DDR Dollar Bill.

481
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Nope.

482
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
It won't make them appeal the more people know why.

483
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Seems to be working for Karaoke Revolution.

484
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Country?

485
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
No, it sucked.

486
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
I thought it was pretty cool.

487
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,200
I played it, and I don't even like country music.

488
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
It was awful.

489
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I liked it.

490
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,440
It was a good game.

491
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,280
Then again, I have a huge distaste for country music.

492
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,080
I want to say a response to the Guitar Hero 80 songs thing.

493
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,120
Rumor and emphasis on rumor is that some of the downloadable packs will have some of the

494
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,040
Guitar Hero 1 songs in them, but I bet you 10 to 1 you would have an easier time seeing

495
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:37,160
the indie label stuff crossover than you would the major label stuff crossover, because they're

496
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,080
going to have to re-license and all that stuff.

497
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,920
I think they would have to.

498
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,360
So you'd have a better chance of seeing some of the harmonics house bands, or freeze pop,

499
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,240
things like that coming over from Guitar Hero 1 than some of the licensed tracks, but that's

500
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
not a no.

501
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,840
That's just a rumor says right now.

502
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:03,280
Moving on, hey OLR people, particularly Rob.

503
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,480
So I bought an Xbox 360 some months ago, and my roommate bought a Wii at launch.

504
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,000
We love many of the games on the systems, but I think that it's time I bought myself

505
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,800
a good gaming PC to play some games that I've never been able to play before, and I have

506
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,920
decided to go with Commodore 64.

507
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
You win the internet.

508
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Who is this?

509
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
You win the internet.

510
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
You'll see.

511
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
All right.

512
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,480
I understand you know a bit about that particular machine, and I was wondering if there's anything

513
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,640
you recommend I look for when going out and buying one.

514
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Kickstart.

515
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
Make sure it works.

516
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,800
Are there particular cables and things that I need to make sure I get, or particular accessories

517
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,920
or games that you recommend I look for?

518
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,620
I was thinking about how all of the current next gen consoles offer extra features like

519
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,140
media playback and use in weather channels, and I realized that the C64 can be used as

520
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,320
a musical instrument, so it's a good contender for my next game platform.

521
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
Thanks in advance.

522
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,680
Regards, Warrior Bob.

523
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,000
You rock, Warrior Bob.

524
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,400
You can hook up a Commodore 64 to a television.

525
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,960
I'm trying to remember, it's been so long, and I had a monitor.

526
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,600
I never hooked up the Commodore 64 to a TV, but I seem to remember the hookups were very

527
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
similar.

528
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,960
The video component was almost the exact same between the two, so you might need some type

529
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,840
of special converter, though, to actually hook it up to a television.

530
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,080
Did you guys have Commodore 64s?

531
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
I thought Rice Princess did.

532
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
No, but you know who did?

533
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
Who?

534
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Captain Kirk.

535
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
Look, Rice Princess.

536
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Shut up.

537
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
You had a Commodore 64, right?

538
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Yeah.

539
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
Did you have it hooked up to a TV?

540
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
No.

541
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Do you remember if there were special cables?

542
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
I can't remember.

543
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
I can't remember either.

544
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
I know.

545
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
It's been so long.

546
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
What about games that you remember on the Commodore 64?

547
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Impossible Mission.

548
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Dude, Impossible Mission was awesome.

549
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,200
What was that game, The Last Ninja, or Revenge of the Ninja, or something that game was?

550
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
That game was awesome.

551
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Revenge of the Ninja was on the Game Boy.

552
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
I think it's The Last Ninja, is what it was called.

553
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
Revenge of the Ninja was on the Sega CD.

554
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,880
It was a cinematic game.

555
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,400
Lazy Jones was a fun game, because that was a bunch of mini games.

556
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Load Runner.

557
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
It's better than Fusion Frenzy.

558
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
I can't remember.

559
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,640
We had nations on Mars or something, like they were the Mars Zoggers.

560
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,920
Pinball Construction Set.

561
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,320
That game's awesome, too.

562
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Oh, shut up!

563
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
It's awesome!

564
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,040
It does not require a special monitor, it can be plugged into a TV.

565
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,400
That's what it says on Wikipedia.

566
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,760
I was going to say, though, Kickstart.

567
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,520
That is the only game I ever played on the Commodore 64.

568
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,640
Is that the one with the button, and you kick with the little clown, and you kick the balloons

569
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
around the screen?

570
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
No, it's a dirt bike racing game.

571
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
Oh, I'm thinking of a different game.

572
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
It's very similar to Excitebike.

573
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
Kickman!

574
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
Never mind.

575
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,800
Excite, it is very similar to Excitebike, so Kickstart.

576
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Gotta get that game.

577
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Winter Games.

578
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Winter Games.

579
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Bard's Tale.

580
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,280
Oh, GameTap has a lot of Commodore 64 games on it, so if you want to try some out, GameTap

581
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
has a bunch.

582
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,680
I'm trying to find the game that I used to play all the time.

583
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,060
I thought it was Bard's Tale, but I tried to look it up, and all the ones that I came

584
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,240
up with did not look anything.

585
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
What was that game?

586
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
The Seven Scrolls, or whatever that game was?

587
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,160
No, all I remember is a miasmal cur from the game.

588
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,400
That's the only thing that sticks out in my mind.

589
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,520
Well good luck with your Commodore 64 adventures, and you have to try GEOS at some point.

590
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,080
GEOS?

591
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,320
See the Commodore 64 as a Mac.

592
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Oh, God.

593
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,400
Dude, the Commodore 64 was awesome.

594
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,680
I love the Commodore 64.

595
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,600
There's a picture on Wikipedia.

596
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,000
Just about any arcade game that was out in the early 80s had a port on the Commodore

597
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
64.

598
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You name it.

599
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,520
Donkey Kong, Kongo Bongo, whatever, it's out there.

600
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,120
And Captain Kirk did have one.

601
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,920
There was a Star Trek game on the Commodore 64, you smartass.

602
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,760
Yeah, he had one in Star Trek II.

603
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,040
Let us know what Commodore 64... In fact, I would urge all our listeners at some point

604
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,840
this week, because there is a website where you can play Commodore 64 games.

605
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,840
I can't remember what the hell it was.

606
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Maybe somebody in chat remembers.

607
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,440
There was some site that had nothing but Java Commodore 64 games, so you can play a ton

608
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,880
of them online.

609
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,400
I urge everyone to play one Commodore 64 game this week, and check out the roots of PC gaming.

610
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Definitely make it an impossible mission.

611
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:01,240
Okay, so speaking of the Commodore 64, who had a TI-85?

612
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,720
I know what they are, but I didn't have one, because we had a Commodore 64.

613
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
They were better.

614
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,720
I had a Coleco, I had an Atom.

615
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,600
Anyway... And if you had an Apple II, I'm sorry.

616
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,720
We had one at my school, and I played a lot of Kix, and that was all I cared about.

617
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,320
Somebody in our chat room, Kamara, says Lemon64.com.

618
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
I've never seen this site.

619
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,800
This isn't the same site I use, but it looks like this will work.

620
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
I think you can do this.

621
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
I'm going to try it.

622
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

623
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,160
This comes from Cutie Honey.

624
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,320
I just got two things to say this time.

625
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,920
I recall a comment at the end of the Sunday show where Rob said that the show needs more

626
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
gay people.

627
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,000
Well, I guess you can count me as the O.O.

628
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Army's first bisexual.

629
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Pleasure to meet you guys.

630
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,360
I'm sorry you've been... You're beaten to that from show one.

631
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,680
Sorry.

632
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,240
Second, on a completely different note, two weeks ago you guys started a discussion about

633
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,000
games that have too many sequels and remakes.

634
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,440
In chat, I brought up the fact that DDR had many games, and suddenly a ton of people went

635
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
crazy.

636
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,720
A fun kind of crazy, mind you.

637
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Wait, wait, wait.

638
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Bisexual male or female?

639
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Male.

640
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Over 18?

641
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Single?

642
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Did he attach a picture?

643
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
No.

644
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Just kidding.

645
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
I'm kidding.

646
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
I'm kidding.

647
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Rob, can I finish the email?

648
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
I'm sorry.

649
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
It's Valentine's Day, and I'm single.

650
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Rob, it's not Valentine's Day.

651
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Do you know what I'm doing on Valentine's Day?

652
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Crochets.

653
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:27,200
Having my neck adjusted and going to school.

654
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Fun.

655
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
How romantic.

656
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Anyway, can I finish reading the email, please?

657
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Yes, you may.

658
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Okay.

659
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Where was I?

660
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Oh, yeah.

661
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,160
So, here's the burning question.

662
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,200
Do you think Konami beats a dead horse by releasing several Bimani games each year with

663
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,640
only different song lists?

664
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Excuse me.

665
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,360
I blame the orange soda for that.

666
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,720
Although I'm not helping the situation by buying every PS2 DDR game that gets released,

667
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,560
it's kind of annoying to see some new features like battle mode added when you have to ask

668
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,120
yourself why didn't they add it last year.

669
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,160
The cheap rational bastard in me would rather like a DDR game that has over 150 songs in

670
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,360
it with more modes graphical upgrades in 2008 than a 70-song game with two new dancing avatars

671
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
later this year.

672
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,120
Anyway, thanks for your time.

673
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,440
I spent an hour going to school on public transportation, and your podcast keeps it

674
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,680
from being boring.

675
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,280
Keep up the good work, cutie honey.

676
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,840
All right.

677
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,640
Wait, no honey fresh?

678
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
No?

679
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,880
I thought that was going to be all that she was planning for.

680
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,080
You know, I think the Bimani games coming out very similar every year with different

681
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
song lists.

682
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Keep in mind there's new modes.

683
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,020
Usually, Konami tries to throw something new in it every time, whether it be the single

684
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,520
player mission master or the hands and feet or whatever new thing they did.

685
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,280
But I would say it's no different than the Madden 06, 07, 08 games that come out.

686
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,560
And some people don't get that just like some people don't get the DDR games that come out

687
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
every year.

688
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,360
I think it's just kind of if you're into that, then you kind of accept that as part of what

689
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,320
the games go through each year with the change.

690
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,160
So that's what I say.

691
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,720
With the new songs come new step charts and new challenges, you know, I don't know.

692
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,220
But see, from the other perspective, ask somebody who doesn't play DDR as much as I do and they

693
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,960
probably think, it's stupid.

694
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
It's the same game every time.

695
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,440
And you know, that's just, you know, that's how some of us, what some of us say about

696
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,040
Madden is that, you know, it's roster update 2007.

697
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,160
Well, you know, we don't really play those games, so we don't understand.

698
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,320
So I try not to say that if I do, it's in jest.

699
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,840
It actually in the beginning with DDR, it used to have a lot of significant changes

700
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
with each one.

701
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:38,120
You know, the first I remember, you know, with Fifth Mix, you had the actual tempo freezes,

702
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,520
which was like, you know, when you first played, you're like, what the fuck?

703
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,800
You know, the song stopped.

704
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Someone broke the machine.

705
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,920
Oh, it started up again.

706
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,240
So that was kind of neat.

707
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:54,420
And then, of course, you had tempo changes, you know, and Fourth Mix and stuff like that.

708
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:01,080
And then, you know, with Max, you had freeze notes, which, you know, were definitely different

709
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
at the time.

710
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
I don't know.

711
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,280
So they keep, they try to keep it pretty fresh with each one.

712
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,080
But you know, after a while, they do start looking very similar.

713
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,440
Dude, I got a friend request on Facebook.

714
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
The show rocks.

715
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,600
Is it a hot gay man?

716
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
No, it's not.

717
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
No hot gay man?

718
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Oh.

719
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
No.

720
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
That was the last email, so.

721
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Straight man.

722
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Yep.

723
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
But a cool one.

724
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Yeah.

725
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
What's your Facebook address, Rob?

726
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
You don't have addresses on Facebook.

727
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
You have to look me up by name.

728
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
But I use my stage name, Rob Roberts.

729
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Really?

730
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
So it's easy to find me on Facebook.

731
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
That's cool.

732
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Jamie, you should get a Facebook, too.

733
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
That's kind of fun.

734
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
That's okay.

735
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
I have.

736
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Oh, I got another one, too.

737
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Look at this.

738
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Oh, I'm popular.

739
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Yay.

740
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
All right.

741
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,080
Speaking of popular, you know what game is popular out there?

742
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Gears of War.

743
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,880
I mean, everyone's got a big heart on over Gears of War.

744
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,040
Except for me, because I don't really like the game.

745
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:59,280
But anyways, it did win eight awards at the 10th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

746
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,840
And these aren't like achievement points, but you know, whatever.

747
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:11,240
It did win a bunch of different awards, including Game of the Year, Best Console Game, Best

748
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:21,260
Animation, let's see here, among some other ones here, Best Outstanding Character Performance

749
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:31,560
of a Male, Best Online Gameplay, Best Visual Engineering, and Action Adventure Game of

750
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,400
the Year.

751
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,560
Surprise.

752
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,040
You know, Gears of War wins more awards.

753
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
What?

754
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:46,320
No, I'm actually with Loki, I mean, eh, you know, I could care less.

755
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Why?

756
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,160
Well, Gears of War is a phenomenal game.

757
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Blah, blah, blah.

758
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,160
So is Halo, but that one sucks, too.

759
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
That's what everybody on the internet says.

760
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,160
It must be true.

761
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,520
When Halo 3 comes out this year, and even if it isn't as good as Gears of War, and you

762
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,040
know, it could be like half as good as Gears of War or whatever, people will still be giving

763
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,720
this thing awards and getting a big boner over this game because it's Halo.

764
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
I don't know.

765
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,920
My Gears was okay, but I mean, just, I don't know, it didn't give me the boner it gave

766
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,400
the rest of the internet, I guess.

767
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,080
Anyhow, this might give a lot of sci-fi fans a boner, though.

768
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,200
Eddie, get your hand away from me.

769
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:35,360
According to the Hollywood Reporter, Universal MBC, which is part of Vivendi, they are working

770
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,280
on a space combat game, it's like a sim game, set in the Battlestar Galactica universe,

771
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,760
and I'm talking the new one, not the old one.

772
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,560
Or Galaxy Bellactica.

773
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,840
Digital download for PC and Xbox Live Arcade, and there's a tie-in, by the way, with Xbox

774
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,080
because there's new Battlestar Galactica gamer picks and themes available for low amounts

775
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
of Microsoft points.

776
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,280
Are the characters going to cry their emo tears?

777
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,200
Hey, Battlestar Galactica is a pretty good show.

778
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,120
I don't know if you've ever actually watched it, it's actually pretty good.

779
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,960
It's the Krylons, not the Cylons.

780
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Whatever.

781
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Stop being uneducated.

782
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,320
It will be hard for Eddie, I'm kidding.

783
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,300
I'm looking forward to seeing what this looks like on Xbox Live, I bet it's fun.

784
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,480
I don't care about Xbox, but on PC it's going to be awesome.

785
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,920
I have some news that people might care about, but I don't know, not really.

786
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,840
But we have friends at Buena Vista Games, at least they've always been really, really

787
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,200
great at E3 to work with because when Square says, you can't film that, they're like, here,

788
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,320
let me play it while you film it.

789
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,520
But they have renamed themselves.

790
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,440
They are now called Disney Interactive Studios.

791
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,400
They're dissed.

792
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,160
So they're officially now making their Disney affiliation public.

793
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,040
So when we see Kingdom Hearts and the Disney Interactive Studios, we get it.

794
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:04,000
They're still doing non-Disney games, too, to every extent extra, which is one of them.

795
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,760
But they are now officially Disney oriented.

796
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,320
Just like Disney presents the M-rated dinosaur-hunting Turok coming out later this year.

797
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,560
That should be interesting.

798
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
Disney's Turok.

799
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,440
I wonder if we'll have a theme ride based on that.

800
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,840
Maybe we should have crossover because Disney owns ABC as well, so we should have crossover

801
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,480
with the characters from Dinosaur.

802
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,960
Not the mama, boo!

803
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Awesome.

804
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,800
That would be awesome.

805
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,280
I hope there's some TGIF fans out there that get my joke, or I'm going to look stupid as

806
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
usual.

807
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Anyway.

808
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,760
Let's give it up for 92, y'all!

809
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,080
92 in the house!

810
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,400
Well this might make some people happy.

811
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,120
Square Enix confirms a brand new MMO coming to 360 and Vista, and possibly the PlayStation

812
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
3.

813
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:01,200
But whether it's going to be a sequel to Final Fantasy XI, maybe Final Fantasy XIV, huh?

814
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Huh?

815
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Again?

816
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Final Fantasy XI-II.

817
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,560
11D blue.

818
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,840
Or as some folks on the internet might say, Final Fantasy XI-II.

819
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,120
Because remember how everybody said Final Fantasy X-II?

820
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,640
We had this huge debate, and we actually emailed Square to have them settle the debate on whether

821
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,360
it was called X-II or X-X-X.

822
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
Forget it.

823
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
It was funny.

824
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
Uh, anyways.

825
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,320
Rice Princess, you look very excited about the prospect of Final Fantasy XI-II or Final

826
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Fantasy XIV.

827
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,920
I'm going to crap my pants in eager anticipation.

828
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,600
What if it's Chrono Trigger Online?

829
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,680
Fuck yeah, I'll play that!

830
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
There you go!

831
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
Hell yeah!

832
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
That's where I'm really going to crap my pants.

833
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,160
Ew, that's kind of gross.

834
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,400
What if it's, like, Saga Frontier Online?

835
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,680
Pass!

836
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,040
I would be the only person playing it!

837
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
Probably!

838
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Like, yes!

839
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
I can farm all the gold.

840
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,600
That's it.

841
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,880
Okay, we can move on.

842
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,160
I would play Final Fantasy XI-II, because as much crap as I get Final Fantasy XI now,

843
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,800
I did waste two and a half years of my life on it, so there must have been something in

844
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,520
that game I saw, and it was-

845
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Add it!

846
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Add it!

847
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:20,280
It was a good game while it lasted, but I'm in full Final Fantasy XI recovery.

848
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
That's gross.

849
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,680
No, it was actually the people.

850
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,280
The over-18 link shell people I had.

851
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,280
I got a mighty big link shell here for you.

852
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,360
Uni in our chat room is a self-confessed FFXI whore.

853
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
There you go.

854
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,680
I win, I spent four years, says Uni.

855
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
I feel your pain.

856
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,320
Have you ever spent real money on gold?

857
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,640
That was the point when I knew I had to quit, when I was contemplating spending real money

858
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
on gold.

859
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,920
Rob, I'm sorry, that's just a little bit too-

860
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,380
That's why I quit!

861
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,400
Because I said, you know what, no, that's actually-

862
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,680
Good for you, Rob!

863
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,860
The other reason why I quit is because when I was sitting there for an hour, literally

864
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,900
doing nothing, waiting for a party, I was like, I can't take this anymore.

865
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,040
Waiting for a pretend party in the game?

866
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,880
A panty party!

867
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
That's awesome!

868
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,840
Like your friends call you, what are you doing?

869
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,680
Oh, waiting for a party to start?

870
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,680
Sweet!

871
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,280
Sweet, can I come over?

872
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Oh no, it's online.

873
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
No, it's online.

874
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
It's my online friend.

875
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
We're gonna do a raid.

876
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,040
Well, look, you do the same fucking thing in World of Warcraft, you have no room to

877
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,040
talk.

878
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
You know what I do?

879
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
I jump around a tree for ten minutes-

880
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,000
You tell Chuck Norris jokes in the barons while you wait for a party, that's the only

881
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
difference.

882
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
No, I don't.

883
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,520
I talk to all of my geeky friends on WoW while I'm jumping around a tree for half an hour,

884
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
and I could be leveling.

885
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,840
All right, anyhow.

886
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,880
I was looking real quickly since you mentioned buying gold, and everyone's favorite site

887
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,800
to hate, ige.com, they actually have options where you can purchase gold amounts up to

888
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,280
fifty million, or at least Gil.

889
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Fifty million!

890
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,640
Fifty million Gil, which is $1,563.50, who the fuck would spend that real money-

891
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,300
Oh my god, oh no, that's lame, hey, wait a minute, whatever happened to our donation,

892
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,680
we never spent it, huh?

893
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
Just kidding.

894
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,900
You know what, Rob, I am policing that, okay?

895
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,080
And we're going to use it to send me to ASIN.

896
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,240
No, yeah, then I'm policing that now.

897
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
No.

898
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,920
She'll be all like, back me donation, please.

899
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,160
No, but will you please tell the back me wool story to our listeners?

900
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Why?

901
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
It's lame.

902
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
Because it's funny, no, just tell it.

903
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
Tell it, it's a WoW story.

904
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,900
Okay, so Brad was playing WoW, and some guy opened a trade window with him, and just gave

905
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,320
him a bunch of wool, and then they just whispered to him, uh, tailoring?

906
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,720
And he's like, no.

907
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,320
And the guy's like, back me wool, please.

908
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,800
And I don't know if Brad gave it back or not, but I thought it was funny, because it's a

909
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Chinese farmer.

910
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
There's the inside joke!

911
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
That's hilarious.

912
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,320
But, you have to understand, now Irene is a hunter character, and her pet is, or no,

913
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,720
the name of her character is back me wool, and the name of the pet is please.

914
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,880
And nobody gets that.

915
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
I do.

916
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,080
And now our listeners will, if they ever play on Ravencrest.

917
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,560
Yeah, don't play on Ravencrest.

918
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,560
Oh, Har.

919
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
Oh, wow.

920
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
Trainwreck.

921
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,560
Choo choo.

922
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,040
Oh, I'm sorry, oh shit, it's my turn for a story, my bad.

923
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,800
Yeah, Rob, I'm sitting here waiting on Rob, and you're telling Chuck Norris jokes in my

924
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,800
eye lockup.

925
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,680
I'm writing the show off tonight, I'm just writing it off, because this is not a good

926
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
show.

927
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
All right, no, I'm kidding.

928
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
This show is off.

929
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,680
This is amazing.

930
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
Silly, silly.

931
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,840
All right, here's another rule that is amazing.

932
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,980
GameStop, you probably have read about this on your favorite blog, but I know some folks

933
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,880
here in the studio have got to share their stuff on this.

934
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,360
Now there's legislation out there, of course, looking to get stricter penalties on games.

935
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,280
Well, GameStop released an internal memo this week, actually it was a conference call, and

936
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,560
managers were told about a new rule, it's a new strict policy, this is it.

937
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:04,220
If you sell a game, an M-rated game, to an underage customer, you get fired, and if you're

938
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:10,320
the manager of that store, whether you were there or not, you get fired as well, for managing

939
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,320
such a shitty employee.

940
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,880
I'm so glad that Dan quit.

941
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,480
GameStop, it doesn't work there, but what do you think of this policy?

942
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,280
I think it's retarded, and I'm glad that Dan quit.

943
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
Why?

944
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,280
Well, the manager, I agree that the manager should have better trained the employee, but

945
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,360
really it's the employee that should suffer for it.

946
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,480
I think that the manager should be written up.

947
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,480
I think that's acceptable.

948
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,880
What are you going to do, make me work overtime?

949
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,620
I'm just going to sell an M-rated game to a six-year-old, and then you're going to get

950
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,620
your ass fired.

951
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,160
I don't give a shit about this job.

952
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,760
Let's go get another one.

953
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,920
I think it's retarded because there's no actual law that says you have to do that, but hey,

954
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,640
whatever, that's their store policy, I guess.

955
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,680
Just make sure you follow it, but yeah, who cares?

956
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,080
I remember there was a news thing also where people were doing a sting to see who they

957
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:09,600
can get to sell a six-year-old or whatever.

958
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,920
Is that like that Dateline NBC where they trap people on the internet and get them to

959
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,880
come over wearing no pants to meet the 12-year-old girl, and then the reporter guy jumps out

960
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,680
and says, surprise, I'm from NBC, and the guy's like, I'm so embarrassed.

961
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,600
Is it like that, but for games?

962
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,880
Something like that.

963
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,460
Every time I watch Dateline, every time I've ever watched Dateline, it's that.

964
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,480
They should just call it the pedophile show.

965
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,720
I bet more people would watch if they changed their name from Dateline to the pedophile

966
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
show.

967
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
Pedophile show.

968
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,120
Yeah, they could have a little cheesy thing.

969
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,840
This is really bad tonight.

970
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,600
Shadownextgen in chat.

971
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,560
Thank you, chat room, for keeping us on track here, chat.orangeontrader.com.

972
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,220
Shadownextgen says, the policy where managers get fired because of what their employees

973
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,360
did is fucked up.

974
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,920
I think they're responsible for training the employees properly, and so writing up is not

975
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
good.

976
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,840
Yeah, but what if I'm so mad at my manager and I'm going to quit anyway?

977
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,880
I'm going to sell a game to fuck my manager over, too.

978
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,880
That's kind of screwed up.

979
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,520
I would hope there's a way to dispute the firing or something.

980
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,720
And to be honest, the only way they're going to get in trouble is if the fucking parent

981
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,160
says, hey, I didn't know this game had that kind of content in it, if you tell the parent

982
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,960
or whatever.

983
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,560
What if, for example, Billy has his friend's older brother buy the game for him or something

984
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:44,880
like that, and then gets into Billy's hands and his parents go, where the fuck do you

985
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,880
get this from?

986
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,920
Well, the GameStop people sold it to me, and now people are getting fired because of that.

987
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,240
Legend of Zaku makes a very interesting comparison here, says, it's only fair, Jamie, just like

988
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,760
an Abu Ghraib, where the people who carried out the torture got the hammer, while the

989
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,240
folks who ordered it got off scot-free.

990
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,200
Remember the Iraq torture thing?

991
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:13,460
Yeah, but the GameStop owners aren't telling them to sell the games.

992
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:17,800
That was the strangest comparison.

993
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,600
No offense to Zaku, because everyone's going to tell their opinions.

994
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,600
That was stupid.

995
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,600
Wow.

996
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,600
I'm sorry.

997
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:30,040
How is that even a... Oh, yeah, we want you to sell this game, oh, and you're fired.

998
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,200
That's fucking stupid.

999
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,240
God, think before you try to make a witty comparison, thank you.

1000
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,720
I'm sorry, but that doesn't work.

1001
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Wow.

1002
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,680
Yeah, you should be selling more of those stupid, was it more cards or whatever they

1003
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,160
call them now, the edge cards.

1004
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,080
But what if they sell them pornographic material?

1005
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,080
Will they get fired?

1006
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,080
Or will they get a raise?

1007
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,080
I got a raise.

1008
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,280
They get a raise.

1009
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,280
Wow.

1010
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Okay.

1011
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,840
We promised in the year 2007 our New Year's resolution was to do more PC gaming news,

1012
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,800
so Dark Sakura, could you help us achieve our New Year's resolution?

1013
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,320
Yes, I will, and this is actually centered towards our European friends.

1014
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
Yeah.

1015
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
Cheers.

1016
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
Did you say jizz?

1017
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,320
No, cheers.

1018
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,320
I meant like you said jizz.

1019
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,320
Jizz.

1020
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,800
And wait, PC gaming, like politically correct gaming?

1021
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
No, like a personal computer.

1022
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Because...

1023
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:39,760
Anyway, there's a martial arts MMO called Nine Dragons, and the beta is open in Europe,

1024
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,520
actually opening in Europe, they said that you'll actually be able to play and get double

1025
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:51,200
experience until, let's see, actually I'm not finding the date on here is the sad thing.

1026
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,160
It may be actually open right now.

1027
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,020
In fact, you can actually apply for the, okay, here it is, you can apply for the beta over

1028
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:06,280
on the website, which is ninedragons.acclaim.com slash welcome.htm, and you can keep on going

1029
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,640
to the site and check out the demo there, but they're doing a double experience push

1030
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,640
that actually may be over already, by the time I saw this, it was already over.

1031
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,320
But hey, you can try the game.

1032
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,320
Cool.

1033
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,560
Dude, I got three more friend requests on Facebook.

1034
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,560
I'm so popular.

1035
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,560
Stop gloating.

1036
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,560
I'm popular.

1037
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,560
No.

1038
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,560
This is great.

1039
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,560
The internet is awesome.

1040
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,560
Everybody can be a winner.

1041
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,560
It's because I just found out.

1042
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:39,000
As I mentioned in part A, Galactic Civilizations 2 is getting a brand new expansion pack called

1043
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,320
Dark Avatar.

1044
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:49,600
It's actually being released early, and yeah, you can definitely check it out now if you're

1045
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:57,160
into that, and it introduces brand new asteroid builds full of resources and unique planets

1046
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,400
and other fun stuff like that.

1047
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,800
I don't play Galactic Civilizations 2, but it sounds fun.

1048
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,920
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

1049
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,560
Eddie got a text message and was sharing it with everybody.

1050
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,720
Was it more friends requests on Facebook?

1051
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,240
No, it was not a Facebook friend request.

1052
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,720
I already took care of those.

1053
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:23,800
Oh yeah, Dark Avatar, one week early, good times.

1054
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,160
I'm sorry, a heart.

1055
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,640
Can I have a hug, Loki?

1056
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,640
Can I have a hug?

1057
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,120
Can I have a hug, Jamie?

1058
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,120
If you buy me dinner.

1059
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:40,160
No, I'll buy you coffee, decaf, because I know you don't drink caffeine this late.

1060
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,480
And potato pancakes.

1061
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
I'll think about it.

1062
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,480
Do I get a hug right now?

1063
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,480
Live on air?

1064
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,480
Yay!

1065
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,920
Hold on, now I know this isn't TV, but here, I'll put the mic, when I hug Jamie, I'll put

1066
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,320
the mic kind of at my chest level, so maybe you can hear her boob.

1067
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,440
I did get that on my boob.

1068
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Oh my God.

1069
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,760
If you did want to download the expansion pack, you can go to TotalGaming.net for that.

1070
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,120
I feel like such a whore now.

1071
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,480
It's actually available now.

1072
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,920
I guess the retail version is coming out on the 14th.

1073
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,560
Rob just made me a whore.

1074
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:16,600
Anyhow, now this, I am declaring, I know it's February, but I'm declaring the upcoming news

1075
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:23,360
article, the best PC gaming story of 2007, right here.

1076
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,360
Here it is.

1077
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,720
This guy, Warrior Bob, who asked what Commodore 64 games, here it is.

1078
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,880
This is the game, and it's coming back, guys.

1079
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,240
Arkon is making its return.

1080
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,880
Originally released in 1983, Arkon was like, it was like chess, but like when the piece

1081
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,680
of one, I know you remember, Irene, because you're as big of a nerd as me, but for the

1082
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,240
folks who may not know, Arkon was like chess, but like the pieces would actually do battle

1083
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,240
with each other when you tried to capture another piece.

1084
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,240
Oh, battle chess.

1085
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,740
No, it's not battle chess, because battle chess, the animations were already pre-done.

1086
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,960
You actually had like a real-time fighting thing.

1087
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,220
This game was also on the NES.

1088
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,840
They ported it to several platforms.

1089
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,880
What about battle chess?

1090
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,240
Arkon is better, and then there was even Arkon 2 and 3.

1091
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,400
We don't talk about Arkon 2 and 3, because Arkon was like the best.

1092
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:12,200
What's going on, though, is that Murid Interactive, an investment company who is in the video

1093
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:18,200
game industry, announced a licensing deal with Freefall Games, who created Arkon, to

1094
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,040
resurrect the game for modern platforms.

1095
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,400
That is the most exciting news ever.

1096
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,960
Here's a quote from Murid Interactive.

1097
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,480
�We are incredibly pleased to have signed this brand.

1098
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,280
Arkon is a well-respected license that has huge nostalgic value for the right reasons.

1099
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,520
The gameplay, the great combination of strategic thinking, and the intense arcade action.�

1100
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,600
Okay, seriously, if this game comes to Xbox Live Arcade, I will have died from too much

1101
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,480
orgasm.

1102
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,480
Like right now?

1103
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,480
Yeah, seriously.

1104
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,120
I'm like, look at my pants.

1105
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,120
Look at my pants.

1106
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,120
They got bigger.

1107
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,120
No, please don't.

1108
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,280
I am so incredibly happy.

1109
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,560
You don't even know how many games of Arkon I played, light versus dark, probably in the

1110
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,720
year 83 or later.

1111
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,520
Stop it, Eddie.

1112
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,100
Now, did you see, this is also kind of PAC related, did you see the thing that they were

1113
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,760
talking about in Spore?

1114
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,760
They're showing off some stuff at DICE also, and one of the demonstrations that they showed

1115
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:22,000
were it was, I believe, the Care Bears versus the Klingons.

1116
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,080
It created the two races and had them battle it out.

1117
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,080
The Kapla-ster.

1118
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:32,620
I can't wait until that game comes out.

1119
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:37,360
I'm going to just become a hermit once that game comes out.

1120
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,360
You'll have your game.

1121
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,360
I'll have Arkon.

1122
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,480
Jamie will have Cookie Mama on the Wii.

1123
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,480
We're all happy.

1124
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,480
No, you know what?

1125
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,200
The whole PC days is on the DS.

1126
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,080
They could do Return to Zork.

1127
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,080
Zork is awesome.

1128
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,640
Only the nerdiest of the nerds, because that would work perfectly on DS.

1129
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,080
We found a 404 page that was the first Zork.

1130
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,120
Yeah, the text game?

1131
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,120
Yeah.

1132
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,120
Oh, by the way.

1133
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,120
Oh, good point.

1134
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,920
Rob D in chat says Jamie will have Rondo of Blood.

1135
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,120
Yes, I will have Rondo of Blood.

1136
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,840
I have to talk about Rondo of Blood every five seconds, by the way.

1137
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,320
Cookie Mama did get pushed up into March.

1138
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,520
It originally was in April, so it's coming out sooner.

1139
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,120
It's going to be out before my birthday.

1140
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,960
Do you know that Eddie actually told me about a fantasy he had once?

1141
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:23,260
Eddie's fantasy was that he actually gets eaten by a grue.

1142
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:26,800
If you get that joke, you're awesome.

1143
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,800
Turn out the lights, Rob.

1144
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,800
Give me five.

1145
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,800
You're a winner.

1146
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,560
That's right, because the lights have to be off.

1147
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,400
We're all getting eaten by a grue.

1148
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,780
That's not a grue.

1149
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,680
Why don't you stab the innkeeper?

1150
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,680
The sheriff will come.

1151
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,680
Here you go.

1152
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,680
Here's your grue.

1153
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,680
Stop it.

1154
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,680
I found you a grue.

1155
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,880
I am Morpheus.

1156
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,560
This show makes me happy.

1157
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,120
I love this.

1158
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,120
It is pitch black.

1159
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,840
You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

1160
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,840
Good times.

1161
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,840
Wouldn't that work?

1162
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,440
Because I looked on the internet, it's only 95 megabytes, so they could totally have that

1163
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,440
on the DS.

1164
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,640
If you want to look that up on Wikipedia, by the way, that's G-R-U-E.

1165
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,640
Do your homework, kids.

1166
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
What is a grue?

1167
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,440
A grue is a sinister looking presence in the dark places of the earth.

1168
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,200
Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear

1169
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,260
of light.

1170
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,680
No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws

1171
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,480
to tell the tale.

1172
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,480
Grue.

1173
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:31,160
Actually, I read somewhere in an M. Night Shyamalan film that grues hang out with scrunts,

1174
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,160
actually.

1175
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,160
You're a scrunt.

1176
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,160
On the weekend.

1177
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,160
Rob's a scrunty bitch.

1178
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,160
Rob's the scruntiest person in the room.

1179
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,160
You dirty scrunt.

1180
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,720
What?

1181
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,800
Back to console news, DarkSakura.

1182
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,800
What?

1183
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,800
Grue, you scrunch.

1184
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,440
I'm busy looking at pictures of Captain America.

1185
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,440
I mean, we're on to a blood.

1186
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,440
I'll steal your story.

1187
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,440
Okay, Sega Sammy.

1188
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,440
Oh.

1189
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,440
Oh, Sega.

1190
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,440
Sega, Sega.

1191
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,440
Ah!

1192
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,440
What?

1193
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,440
Oh, my God.

1194
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,440
What?

1195
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,440
That.

1196
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,440
That what?

1197
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
I can't see.

1198
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
It's an upcoming story.

1199
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
Okay.

1200
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,440
She-Man.

1201
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,440
Sega!

1202
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,440
How the mighty have fallen.

1203
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,440
Shut up.

1204
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,440
Saturn.

1205
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,440
Sega, Saturn.

1206
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,440
No, anyway.

1207
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,440
Kill me.

1208
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,440
Okay.

1209
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:22,120
After the show, though, we need you to set up the thing.

1210
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:33,240
Anyway, Sega Sammy profits have slid 23%, and I blame them for abandoning the Dreamcast.

1211
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:41,880
So yeah, their net income went down from $526 million to $409 million.

1212
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,640
Sales dropped by 4% to $3.35 billion.

1213
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,440
You could say that their sales flew off course like a poorly controlled Sonic from Sonic

1214
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,720
the Hedgehog on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1215
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,720
Wow.

1216
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,440
And actually, their Pachinko machines are actually becoming a lot less popular than

1217
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,160
they were, too.

1218
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,800
And Pachinko is really, really a big thing.

1219
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,760
GS68 has been spamming the chat room, and usually I don't encourage this, but spamming

1220
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,660
the chat room with this site, segasucks.net, and I'm looking at it, and it looks like somebody's

1221
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,280
GeoCities web page.

1222
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,240
Hey, that's my GeoCities web page.

1223
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,000
Hey, way to use the center...

1224
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Let me look at the FAQ.

1225
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Way to use the center...

1226
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,080
Or the about page.

1227
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,080
Center paragraph.

1228
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,080
See, about this site.

1229
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,680
The first, last, and only thing Sega fans ever have to say when I try to tell them my

1230
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:37,320
site is about stopping companies from ripping gamers off is, ha ha, yes siree, don't you

1231
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,200
know all companies are just out to make money?

1232
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,200
Bob, bob, bob.

1233
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,200
What is the word?

1234
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,200
Yes siree.

1235
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,200
I don't know.

1236
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Yes siree, bob.

1237
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,200
I was going to say, you have to have the bob at the end.

1238
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Do we have a new...

1239
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,480
Loki, you have a new story to talk to us about?

1240
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,960
Yes, let's talk about Crackdown.

1241
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,960
Yes siree.

1242
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:57,920
Crackdown, one of the most awesome games this week, at least the demo is.

1243
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,840
It's only going to be, they're only going to have male avatars to play as right now,

1244
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:07,160
because apparently they haven't finished the female ones, and I guess the females have

1245
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:12,360
a whole new set of animations for bulking up as you progress through the game.

1246
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,580
Because I remember at E3 you could play as a woman in Crackdown.

1247
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,240
So maybe download PAX later.

1248
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,520
What did they not, I mean if the animations were kind of already there, I guess maybe

1249
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,360
it was all the cut scenes and stuff.

1250
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,920
Or maybe they didn't have time to put in all the animations of emotional breakdowns and

1251
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,920
pie baking.

1252
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,920
Don't forget periods.

1253
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,920
Oh, and periods.

1254
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,920
Thank you, Rice Princess.

1255
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,920
You're welcome.

1256
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:43,200
So yeah, if you're looking to play a female character, that won't be happening.

1257
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,280
But you know what though, Crackdown was one of those games that they said that if later

1258
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,600
on they wanted to add a new island, a new set of gangs or whatever, they could do that.

1259
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,040
So I don't see why they wouldn't build that.

1260
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,040
The woman gang.

1261
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,640
You know, female avatars later.

1262
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,400
So you know, it's probably going to be a download pack.

1263
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,840
We're here to complain you to death.

1264
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:11,520
Because you know you have your agility, firearms, explosives, and driving, well they can't level

1265
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,520
up driving skills.

1266
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,100
I mean, come on.

1267
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:18,200
And so complaining I guess would have to be in there.

1268
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:36,920
You

1269
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,520
are putting me looking forward and Crackdown in the same sentence.

1270
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:44,680
Jamie can't give two shits about Crackdown.

1271
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,200
I can't really, not even with you know, X-Lax.

1272
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,360
She's constipated when it comes to Crackdown.

1273
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,680
I would need a colonic, sorry.

1274
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,720
You know if I lose a little more weight, every time I bend over you're going to see a Crackdown

1275
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:07,320
actually.

1276
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:13,800
Speaking of things coming out your ass, EGM posted seven rumors in their magazine.

1277
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,280
I don't know how founded these rumors are or not, but I'm going to share them with you

1278
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,280
now.

1279
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,280
These are from issue number 213.

1280
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,640
Rumor number one we already talked about a little bit earlier in the program.

1281
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:29,040
Square has another MMO in the works for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1282
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,480
It won't be in Vanadiel, but a world from previous FF games.

1283
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,960
So that could be in tandem with...

1284
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:34,960
Is it Ivalis?

1285
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,960
Maybe.

1286
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,960
It could be an Ivalis game.

1287
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,960
Oh my God, that'd be awesome.

1288
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,960
Because that's great.

1289
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,960
Or what if it was like Final Fantasy VI MMO?

1290
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,960
I'm sure a lot of folks have a bone over that.

1291
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:41,960
Hot.

1292
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:42,960
I would hella play that.

1293
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,600
Rumor number two is that Tekken 6 got pushed back until 2008.

1294
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,600
QQ anyway.

1295
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,600
Sorry, Jamie.

1296
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,600
Tekken 6, 2008.

1297
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,600
Bastards!

1298
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,800
That's just a rumor though.

1299
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,200
EGM could be full of it.

1300
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,200
Bastards!

1301
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,840
That is probably true.

1302
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,040
Rumor three, Mistwalker is planning a Blue Dragon 2, but only if it does well in the

1303
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,040
US.

1304
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,160
A DS spinoff is also possible.

1305
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:08,080
Rumor number four is Wipeout will hit the PlayStation 3 in 2007 and it uses the Motor

1306
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,920
Storm engine.

1307
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,440
That could be interesting.

1308
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:19,080
Rumor number five is my hero, Mizuguchi, is working on a Space Channel 5 follow up.

1309
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,080
Space Channel 6.

1310
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,080
No, I'm just kidding.

1311
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,600
I don't know what it's called, but that would be awesome.

1312
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:27,040
It'd be Space Channel 5 2, like MTV2.

1313
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,400
Rumor number six is there's an Indiana Jones game to hit with a movie in 2008.

1314
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,400
Duh!

1315
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,640
Every frickin' big movie gets a game time.

1316
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,040
We've already seen that at E3.

1317
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,040
Duh!

1318
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,040
So, yeah.

1319
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,040
That's not a rumor.

1320
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,440
And then lastly, EA is making a Kitty Madden.

1321
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,440
That's interesting.

1322
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,840
They already have like an Atari, like the backyard football and stuff that sucks balls,

1323
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,920
so I mean, they could easily do that.

1324
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,920
What is a Kitty Madden?

1325
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,920
Like a Kitty Madden?

1326
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,920
No.

1327
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,920
Yes.

1328
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,000
They're bringing the Puppy Bowl and the Kitty Halftime to the console, as we talked about

1329
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
last week.

1330
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,720
EA has heard our prayers.

1331
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,040
Is that what it would sound like?

1332
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
Kinda, yeah.

1333
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,040
Could we hear that again?

1334
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,040
Meow, meow, meow.

1335
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,040
Thank you.

1336
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,040
You're welcome.

1337
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,040
Wow.

1338
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,040
Playing football.

1339
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:16,920
Drew Nami says a Space Channel 5-2 was already released, wasn't it?

1340
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,800
And that's true, but more Space Channel 5 could not be a bad thing.

1341
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:24,640
I have Space Channel 5-2, and that gave me fit, because of the whole backwards level.

1342
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,640
I want pudding.

1343
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,040
I want more, not like actual pudding, but the character.

1344
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,680
I told him way to be random.

1345
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,680
Burr Shaw's one set EA's Linger Abel, 2008.

1346
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,680
That would be one for the kids.

1347
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,280
That would be comparison to Kitty Abel.

1348
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,680
All right, we're going to be taking-

1349
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,280
Irene does have a point.

1350
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,640
I would love to see kittens in like little football jerseys.

1351
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,640
I'm sorry, but that would be as cute as it is.

1352
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,080
I would probably buy that.

1353
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,080
You do?

1354
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,080
All right.

1355
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,080
Well, we'll see if EA answers your prayers.

1356
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,080
The game developers.

1357
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,360
We'll be getting your Skype calls very, very soon.

1358
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,360
We have a couple more stories.

1359
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,480
Well, here's a bunch of no shit, Sherlock.

1360
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:08,800
Yeah, the Wii has outsold the PS3 by a mere three to one ratio in January in Japan.

1361
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,760
Take that, bitches.

1362
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,520
Yeah, like I said, a bunch of no shit there.

1363
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:18,840
I remember, actually one of my coworkers was asking me, he read an article that some PlayStation

1364
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:27,440
rep or someone at Sony was claiming that the PS3 was outselling the Wii and the DS combined

1365
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,440
in Japan.

1366
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,000
It didn't make our show roll tonight because there was a lot of news, but there was a pretty

1367
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,160
well-circulated story out there that somebody from Sony Computer Europe said something like,

1368
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:42,760
if you can find a PlayStation 3 out there on store shelves, I'll give you $1,200 or

1369
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,760
something like that.

1370
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,000
Then they promptly proceeded to show four of them at the same place?

1371
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,160
Yeah, yeah.

1372
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,520
As I saw a bunch of them at GameStop today, wow, I could have made $12,000, but I don't

1373
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,520
think he was serious.

1374
01:04:54,520 --> 01:05:01,400
See, if they're selling at a three to one ratio, so basically they're selling, okay,

1375
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,400
the system's what?

1376
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,440
Let's just round up to $300, right?

1377
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,700
So they're making $900 for every $600 that Sony makes.

1378
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:17,440
They're already beating them by $300 per system, not per system, but per group sale if you're

1379
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,100
comparing Nintendo's 3 to Sony's 1.

1380
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:25,820
And they're not even accounting if they're doing the high-end system or the low-end system.

1381
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:31,420
So even profit-wise, Nintendo's got the head above it because I've actually argued

1382
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:32,420
this with some people.

1383
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:37,560
They're saying, oh, since Sony's selling for more, they're going to make more money.

1384
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:43,600
No, because Nintendo loves us, and supply is doing its damned best to meet demand.

1385
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,600
Wow, this is great.

1386
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:51,200
Jernami sent me a link to this week's Penny Arcade, which actually makes fun of this specific

1387
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
instance as well.

1388
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:57,080
It says, in a recent interview, SCEA President Jack Tretton claimed that he would pay a $1,200

1389
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:01,200
bounty on any PS3 system that was found on store shelves, and they went around town and

1390
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,440
proceeded to get two at the Best Buy across the street, one at the Target, and by the

1391
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,800
end, they'd racked up $13,200.

1392
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,440
And then it says, when we get the money, we should go get a couple of Wiis.

1393
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,400
Yeah, if we can find one.

1394
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,000
Which is, you know what, if you're a Sony fanboy, I'm sorry that we keep picking on

1395
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,520
you, but it's true, I mean, Wiis are still hard to come by.

1396
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,680
Keep in mind what I said earlier in part A about the guy who came, dude, I got a Wii

1397
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,640
today, I actually found one, like, Target got a shipment this morning.

1398
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,720
It's true, like, Wiis are still kind of hard to come by, and PlayStation 3s or...

1399
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,120
Yeah, my local blockbuster, like, all the employees there are, like, vying for the Nintendo,

1400
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,760
and like, I go in, they'll be like, oh my god, I got mine, because they, like, cannot

1401
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,760
find them.

1402
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,760
It's crazy.

1403
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:48,040
And you know what, once Tactics comes out on PSP, the PSP's gonna outsell the PS3 again.

1404
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,040
You think?

1405
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,040
The PSP's gonna outsell the PS3?

1406
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,040
Yeah, when Tactics comes out, because I'm gonna buy one.

1407
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,320
You are not a PSP fangirl, in the least.

1408
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:00,160
I absolutely am not, like, I could care less, but with this news about Tactics coming onto

1409
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,280
PSP with the frickin' Dark Knights, woo-hoo, I'm so happy.

1410
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,280
Did you just come?

1411
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,280
What was that?

1412
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,280
A little bit, yeah.

1413
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:12,480
But, um, yeah, and then, Castlevania, and then Luminous 2, and yeah, I think I'm gonna

1414
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,480
have to invest in one.

1415
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,480
All right.

1416
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:21,240
Well, thank you, Jamie, for the Japanese sales report, or should I say, arigato.

1417
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,400
I did find something completely unrelated, though, and that's someone made Captain America

1418
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,800
in Smackdown vs. Raw.

1419
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,600
You're right, that's completely unrelated.

1420
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,680
I know, but I think it's pretty funny.

1421
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,680
Low-key.

1422
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:39,200
One more story, and then we're gonna go to our Skype line at 877-GAME-OLR.

1423
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,760
One game that has a character creation mode as well as Mortal Kombat Armageddon, and well,

1424
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,280
that being the last one that's gonna be on our current-gen consoles, we do have the rumors

1425
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:53,520
of Mortal Kombat 8, and they've basically said they're gonna be using the Unreal 3 engine,

1426
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,880
because everybody and their mother are fucking using the Unreal 3 engine for their games,

1427
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,280
so great.

1428
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,880
It's gonna be great-looking, so hurrah.

1429
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,960
I don't know, no details, really, on the game at all, except that they were supposed to

1430
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:14,840
be starting from scratch again, so, whatever that means.

1431
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:21,660
Mortal Kombat on the Unreal engine, I mean, is it gonna be like a 3D fighter, or, I don't,

1432
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:25,880
because they say it's not gonna be like a fighting-type game like we know today, so,

1433
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,800
I mean, but I can't help but think of, like, some of those really crappy Mythologies games

1434
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,020
at Sub-Zero, although the Shallon Monks game wasn't bad.

1435
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:35,760
It reminded me of, like, Ninja Turtles.

1436
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,080
But with Mortal Kombat characters, they should make a game like that, where you could, like,

1437
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,760
throw Kung Lao's hat as a projectile.

1438
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,960
What would you want to see in a new Mortal Kombat game?

1439
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,240
Where could they take the franchise?

1440
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,880
Oops.

1441
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:55,240
Well, I guess we'll open up the Skype line and see what our listeners have to say about

1442
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,240
that.

1443
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,440
You can give us a call, just go to orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.

1444
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,280
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1445
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,800
Also you can give us a call with the old-fashioned telephone.

1446
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,680
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1447
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:14,240
That's toll-free in the United States and Canada, but not toll-free, sad face, abroad.

1448
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,680
You'll have to use the Skype line if you're in the UK or Australia, in which case it's

1449
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,680
probably past your bedtime.

1450
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,680
Wait.

1451
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:20,680
I just want to say.

1452
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,680
What?

1453
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,720
They have to use the old-fashioned telephone, like a rotary phone?

1454
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,720
No, you can use touch tone.

1455
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,720
That would be acceptable.

1456
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,000
Or a party line where you call the operator.

1457
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
You could even...

1458
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Like two cans in a stream?

1459
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
A cellular...

1460
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yes.

1461
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,080
Actually, we're having the Dixie Cups installed this week.

1462
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,120
That's fascinating, and people will be able to use the two tin cans and a piece of yarn

1463
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,120
to talk to us soon.

1464
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,120
Please.

1465
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,960
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1466
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:42,960
Who's this caller?

1467
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,960
Legend of Zaku.

1468
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,800
Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

1469
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,920
What's on your mind?

1470
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,200
Just random stuff.

1471
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,280
Yes, I know.

1472
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,280
You're full of random stuff tonight.

1473
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,080
I'm not taking it back, by the way.

1474
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,840
Zaku, what's on your mind?

1475
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,840
I meant...

1476
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:02,680
Basically, what I meant when I said that was that just like a manager is like a captain

1477
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,600
on a ship, he's responsible for everyone that runs it.

1478
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,440
I mean, that's what you're now doing.

1479
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,040
You have to admit, though, it was a weird...

1480
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:17,040
Yeah, but is a responsible captain on a ship going to order his crew to throw their shipment

1481
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,040
overboard?

1482
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,040
Hmm?

1483
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,040
Still...

1484
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,800
You were doing it as a...

1485
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,960
Your reference specifically stated that the manager was ordering the employees to sell

1486
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:28,960
to me.

1487
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,960
Isn't that what happened at the Boston Tea Party?

1488
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,960
Touche.

1489
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,600
You know what?

1490
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,480
Think your comparisons through before stating them.

1491
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,560
I understand what you mean, however your comparison was completely out of place.

1492
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,560
Can't we just all get along?

1493
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,560
Can't we just...

1494
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,560
No!

1495
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,560
Let's hug.

1496
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,560
No.

1497
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,560
Not until you buy me pie.

1498
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,760
If you changed the tea and touche to a D, it would be douchey.

1499
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,760
Shut up!

1500
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,560
Zaku, please, put us back on track.

1501
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,560
What do you want to talk about?

1502
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:02,520
I want to talk about something I saw on YouTube.

1503
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,640
I swear to God, I'm not fucking with this connection, just like to Jamie.

1504
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,320
Jamie, are you fucking with this connection?

1505
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,720
No, I'm watching someone draw Captain America.

1506
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,040
Zaku, try it one more time.

1507
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,600
Unfortunately, if you can't get it out clearly, we're going to have to move on.

1508
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,600
Zaku, what was on your mind?

1509
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:19,480
Basically, I'm talking about something I saw right now.

1510
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,960
Send it in a text message, Zaku.

1511
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,760
We'll try to get to it later.

1512
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,680
Sorry, but it's just not coming through.

1513
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,480
You'll hear it on the playback.

1514
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,480
That's a bummer.

1515
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,120
All right, if you want to call us, 877-GAME-OLR.

1516
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,520
I swear I was not screwing with that call.

1517
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,520
But I was.

1518
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,520
Poor Zaku.

1519
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,960
Send your question over private message, Zaku.

1520
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,960
I'll take it.

1521
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:40,960
All right.

1522
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,960
Let's go to this call.

1523
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:55,680
Hey, Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind, buddy?

1524
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,680
Well, I recently acquired a laptop.

1525
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,280
It's a new VAIO, and it has Vista on it.

1526
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,560
Ah, so it's a brand new laptop, okay.

1527
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,560
Yeah.

1528
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,880
Um, I do not like it at all.

1529
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,880
Really?

1530
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,880
What's wrong with it?

1531
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:20,840
Well, I mean, there are some applications on it that aren't exactly, you know, well,

1532
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,320
they're smaller applications.

1533
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:30,360
One of them, I think, is actually a foreign one called a Bemania DX, and it's kind of

1534
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,400
like the step mania of B-Mania.

1535
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,400
Right.

1536
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,400
That wouldn't work.

1537
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:40,320
So, basically, you're upset because a lot of the old games and things you were using

1538
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,760
on Windows XP won't work on Windows Vista.

1539
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:54,360
That and also that, I'm trying to remember, the main reason that I downloaded it, well,

1540
01:12:54,360 --> 01:13:00,200
one of them was for music creation software, and my sequencer wouldn't work on it.

1541
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,640
It just performs pretty poor.

1542
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:09,760
But it's pretty, I mean, Vista has all those fancy Windows animations and stuff.

1543
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,520
I mean, the prettiness outweighs the usefulness of the applications, right?

1544
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,040
No.

1545
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,880
Do you think Microsoft's going to fix this with time?

1546
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,880
Yes.

1547
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,680
I've always said that give it a couple of years, and I'm pretty sure that it will be

1548
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,000
an awesome application.

1549
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,280
So what caused you to jump on board the Vista train at this point?

1550
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,440
Was it just because you had no other choice because you got the new laptop?

1551
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:41,320
Yeah, they took the model out that I was going to get.

1552
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,320
I see.

1553
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:47,560
I mean, it's really too bad because it's a great skin, but I can do everything that I'm

1554
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,520
doing on Vista with an XP.

1555
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,720
Are you looking forward to any of the gaming that's supposed to be coming out with Vista,

1556
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:00,920
such as Halo 2 or any of that stuff?

1557
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:09,000
Windows, now that I have a little more powerful Windows machine, because my other two were

1558
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,520
pretty, they were really, really old.

1559
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:24,560
So now that I have something, I got a 2.3 gig processor and two gigs memory.

1560
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:30,340
Now you're the cool kid on the block because you have your 2.3 bazillion hertz or whatever

1561
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:35,800
it is, and a Windows Vista.

1562
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,800
So you have the biggest internet penis on the block.

1563
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,800
I'm down here.

1564
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,800
There you go.

1565
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,800
I got you.

1566
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,800
All right.

1567
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,280
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1568
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:54,920
Also, I'd like to kind of give my opinion on how Konami basically released the same

1569
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,640
game over and over again, but with new songs.

1570
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:58,640
All right.

1571
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,600
Please, because we've got to keep it moving.

1572
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:07,840
Whenever I bought a new BeatMania game, at least, I don't know about DDR, but when I

1573
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,480
bought a new BeatMania game, I significantly improved.

1574
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,960
I almost jumped another level up.

1575
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:22,660
So I think that new songs are really all that I need to justify a whole new game.

1576
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:28,440
Because you have a lot of new songs to kind of practice with and new charts to kind of

1577
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,320
help you out where the other charts were getting a little stale.

1578
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,320
Yep.

1579
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,320
All right.

1580
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,640
Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for the call.

1581
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,640
And have a good week.

1582
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,640
Thanks for calling in.

1583
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,640
Okay?

1584
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,640
Bye.

1585
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,640
All right.

1586
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,640
Later.

1587
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,640
Bye.

1588
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,640
Bye.

1589
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,640
Later.

1590
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,640
So he has a huge EP?

1591
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,640
Yeah, he has a huge EP.

1592
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:51,540
It sounded like either he was high or he had the show on in the background and he was listening

1593
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,540
to it.

1594
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,540
Because I thought I heard myself.

1595
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:54,540
Maybe both.

1596
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,680
Maybe both.

1597
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,680
Just kidding.

1598
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,680
We tease because we love.

1599
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,200
And he does some other calls.

1600
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,720
Let's go over here to this call.

1601
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,720
Hi.

1602
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,720
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1603
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,720
Who's this?

1604
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,000
Hey, it's Saisha here?

1605
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Hi, Saisha.

1606
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
What's on your mind?

1607
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,220
Turn down your speakers because we can hear ourselves a little bit.

1608
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:14,820
What's on your mind?

1609
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:18,260
I can hear it get echo-ing.

1610
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,280
Oh, sorry.

1611
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,320
It's echo-ing.

1612
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,320
That's all right.

1613
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,320
What's on your mind?

1614
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,520
We have a delay too, but that's because it's, you know, our voices are traveling all the

1615
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,520
way across the Atlantic.

1616
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:31,520
So I was just going to ask a question about Final Fantasy 12.

1617
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,520
Yes, what do you want to know about Final Fantasy 12?

1618
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:43,520
I want to know where the story leads to because I look on the internet everywhere and I can't find anything about it and I like spoilers.

1619
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,520
You want spoilers on the story?

1620
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,520
Yeah, I'm impatient.

1621
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,520
I can't tell you that because that would ruin it for our listeners.

1622
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:59,520
You could go to GameFAQs.com and there's a bunch of FAQs on how to get through the game or the strategy guide that's available.

1623
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,520
I'm sure there's places out there where you can get it spoiled.

1624
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,520
You're just not looking hard enough, buddy.

1625
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,520
And besides, I haven't beaten it so I couldn't tell you what happens.

1626
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,520
There was like 50 games that came out in November that I haven't played.

1627
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,520
You haven't beaten it yet?

1628
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:17,520
No, I haven't. I got sucked back into WoW.

1629
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:22,520
Oh true, I got back into WoW at level 70 already.

1630
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:29,520
Is there anything else you want to ask us about tonight besides the spoilers for Final Fantasy 12 which we're not sharing?

1631
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,520
Why are you so crazy this evening?

1632
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,520
I don't know. Why are we crazy this evening?

1633
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,520
That's my fault.

1634
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:41,520
That's partially Eddie and a rice princess being here, but what else? Maybe it's just something in the air.

1635
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,520
I think that I'm a little bit unable to concentrate quite correctly today.

1636
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,520
Thanks. You sound really cute and hot.

1637
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,520
Stop trying to get a date on the show.

1638
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,520
Well, how am I supposed to date him? You sound sexy. Sorry.

1639
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,520
Which means he's probably taken.

1640
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,520
What was I going to say?

1641
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,520
I've been sick, so I think it kind of affects your brain.

1642
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,520
Dark Sakura was way this week. You were with Chris this weekend, right?

1643
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:12,520
So she was hamming it up with the girlfriends this weekend.

1644
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,520
And Loki, well, he probably got laid or something right before the show.

1645
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,520
Oh, yeah, because getting laid makes me crazy.

1646
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,520
It puts me in a good mood.

1647
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,520
No, and I didn't get laid right before the show.

1648
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,520
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1649
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,520
Earlier in the day.

1650
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,520
All right.

1651
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,520
Saisha, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much for your phone call.

1652
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,520
And cheers.

1653
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,520
Take care.

1654
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,520
There was too much delay. I couldn't keep it going. I'm sorry, kids.

1655
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,520
I wanted to say bye, sexy. Thanks a lot.

1656
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,520
We got it. Say it now. Saisha's listening.

1657
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,520
Bye, sexy.

1658
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,520
All right, there you go. You are so weird.

1659
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,520
You're weird. Your face is weird.

1660
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1661
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,520
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1662
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,520
Oh, hi, this is Judy.

1663
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,520
Hi, what's on your mind?

1664
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,520
Hey, Judy.

1665
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,520
Hey, what's up, sexy pants?

1666
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,520
What's on your mind, sweetie?

1667
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:22,520
I was going to ask you guys if World of Warcraft is really worth it.

1668
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,520
Wait, we can hardly hear you. What about World of Warcraft?

1669
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:32,520
When you want to ask what about World of Warcraft?

1670
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,520
Is it really worth it?

1671
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:40,520
She's actually being eaten by a grew as she's talking to us, which is why she can't stop laughing.

1672
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,520
It's so worth it.

1673
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:46,520
What is World of Warcraft? You're the biggest addict probably out of all of us, right, princess?

1674
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,520
What do you think?

1675
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,520
Yeah.

1676
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,520
You hated all MMOs before World of Warcraft.

1677
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,520
I did. I absolutely hated them.

1678
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,520
What sold you on World of Warcraft specifically?

1679
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,520
Well, I don't know.

1680
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,520
Wow, that was an awesome answer.

1681
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,520
Matt gave me the two-week demo-y disk thing, whatever.

1682
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,520
It's all Matt, our friend. Love you, Matt.

1683
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,520
And I was like, whatever, I'm bored. I'm not working.

1684
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:13,520
Uni hung up. She was embarrassed. Don't be embarrassed. It was fun.

1685
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,520
And I'm like, okay, I'll give it a try.

1686
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:22,520
And I got to level 20 in two days or something, and you can't go past level 20 if you're on the demo thing.

1687
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,520
And I'm like, aw, man, that sucks. This game's awesome.

1688
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,520
And so I subscribed to it, and then I signed my life away. It was pretty awesome.

1689
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:35,520
By the way, Paradox Vincent, who I accused of being high earlier, sent me a message that said, no, you're a towel.

1690
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,520
Get it? The towel. Forget it.

1691
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:43,520
DJ Tyrant wants to know, Rice Princess, what level are you?

1692
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,520
I don't have any 60s, and I've been playing for two years.

1693
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,520
But you're a twink. It's because you're a twink, right?

1694
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:52,520
I have many twinks. I have a lot of PVP twinks.

1695
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,520
Warsong Goldshow for life, 111.

1696
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:01,520
My highest level tune is a 38 Warlock on Trollbane.

1697
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:06,520
Uni, I bet you any of the WoW players would be glad to hook you up with a free demo of WoW,

1698
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,520
because they do that thing where you can download a demo on WorldOfWarcraft.com.

1699
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:14,520
So you know what? It's like the whole Xbox 360 strategy, demos, try before you buy.

1700
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,520
And I think that's the best way to figure it out.

1701
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,520
Ooh, girl, and I'll play it with you.

1702
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,520
I'll show you around, girl.

1703
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,520
It's the girls' club on Warcraft.

1704
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,520
Here it is, Uni says the classic, it's just that I want a Blood Elf.

1705
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,520
Blood Elves are hot, dude.

1706
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,520
I want a Blood Elf in my bed.

1707
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,520
I love Black Boy. Black Boy says, okay, WoW has twinks.

1708
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,520
Can you explain what a twink is?

1709
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,520
Not the gay twink.

1710
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,520
Not the gay porn kind of twink, and if you don't know what that is, you're fine.

1711
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:49,520
What is a twink in WoW, Bryce Princess? Where does the name come from?

1712
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:55,520
A twink in WoW is someone that has the best possible gear, the best enchants,

1713
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,520
the best everything that you can have at that level.

1714
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,520
And it helps if they have blonde hair, and they're usually Russian.

1715
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,520
You're terrible, Ron.

1716
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,520
So I have a lot of twinks, and it's easy for me because I'm a girl,

1717
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,520
and I say, hi, I'll be your Internet girlfriend, give me gold.

1718
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,520
And they're like, okay, that's pretty cool.

1719
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,520
I'm like, sweet, I have a twink now, bye.

1720
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,520
Nice knowing you.

1721
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,520
No, I'm not really like that all the time.

1722
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,520
But yeah, that's what a twink is.

1723
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,520
That was educational.

1724
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,520
I'm not going to explain what a gay twink is.

1725
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,520
Look it up on Wikipedia.

1726
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,520
Isn't that so cool?

1727
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,520
Or you could be a guy and just have a really high-pitched voice and be like, hi.

1728
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,520
Actually, they have a Valentine's Day event going on right now.

1729
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,520
They do.

1730
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,520
I was trying to have my girl hit on other girls, but I didn't, nah.

1731
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,520
You were trying to be a lesbian?

1732
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,520
Yeah, that's fun. Lesbians are fun.

1733
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,520
Yeah, you're supposed to hit on guys, and they'll give you money.

1734
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,520
Actually, no, I ended up hitting on guys because I screwed up.

1735
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,520
I got the wrong thing, so I just decided to play it straight.

1736
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,520
But you don't actually hit on other characters.

1737
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,520
You hit on other NPCs is the way it works.

1738
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,520
Yeah, I know, with the hearts on their heads.

1739
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,520
Are we really talking about well?

1740
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,520
I can't believe it.

1741
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,520
Please, let's go to another call.

1742
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,520
Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1743
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,520
What do you want to talk about besides Warcraft?

1744
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,520
How about BeatMania and virtual console games?

1745
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,520
First off, who is this?

1746
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,520
Who said you could call?

1747
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,520
I paid Loki five bucks.

1748
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,520
Oh, it must be DMN. Hi, DMN. What's on your mind?

1749
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:27,520
I'm doing pretty good. You guys were talking about...

1750
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,520
Wait, DMN, you've been a long-time listener to the show, right?

1751
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,520
Yeah.

1752
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,520
Is tonight a good show or a bad show? Be honest.

1753
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,520
God, the show's hilarious. What are you talking about?

1754
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,520
Awesome. Winner.

1755
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,520
Yay, the winner is me.

1756
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,520
Heart!

1757
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,520
Level up.

1758
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,520
We're listening to the one-day show for a second.

1759
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,520
Wow, sorry, I just gained five stamina.

1760
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,520
I'm sorry, you want BeatMania, Wii, what?

1761
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,520
What's one to pole smoking?

1762
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:54,520
Well, you guys were talking about the BeatMania location test in Illinois.

1763
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:04,520
I'm almost wondering if that's a precursor to the oft-rumored, talked-about BeatMania sequel coming to the consoles.

1764
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,520
You know, but we didn't see it at Gamers' Day, which is a little bit of a...

1765
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:13,520
It's not going to happen, but it is a little bit of a frowny face next to the idea,

1766
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,520
because they did announce BeatMania 1 at Gamers' Day last year,

1767
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,520
so I would say it's still up in the air.

1768
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:24,520
No, I'm not familiar with Gamers' Day. Did they announce SupernovaCS?

1769
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,520
Oh, well, we only ran about four stories on Gamers' Day on the site,

1770
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,520
so I urge you to check out wordslouchradio.com.

1771
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,520
Yeah, look at the website, kids.

1772
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,520
What, did you want to know about Gamers' Day?

1773
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:38,520
Yeah, was SupernovaCS announced last year?

1774
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:42,520
I don't remember. Actually, it may not have been.

1775
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,520
You may have me there. I don't think they did announce it.

1776
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:52,520
I think they were showing BeatMania last year, and it was the karaoke revolution country.

1777
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,520
They didn't show Supernova till E3.

1778
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,520
But they had the arcade machine there, and they announced Supernova for the console.

1779
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,520
That's right. They made the announcement of Supernova in the arcades at Gamers' Day last year.

1780
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,520
No, they said the consoles too, I think.

1781
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,520
Oh, yeah, and they said it was going to come to consoles, but they just didn't sew the playable game.

1782
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,520
That's right, because Loki and I were tooting our own horn here.

1783
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,520
Some of the first people in the country to play DDR Supernova. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1784
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,520
You didn't have to do the arm gestures, Ross.

1785
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,520
Who wants to judge me? Who wants to judge me?

1786
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,520
You look like you're trying to fly away.

1787
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,520
How about with a steel-toed boot?

1788
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,520
I wouldn't wash that hand, by the way.

1789
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,520
Ew.

1790
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:33,520
Sephirot1215 says the last consumer DDR shown at Gamers' Day was extreme.

1791
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,520
Okay, there you go.

1792
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:42,520
Now, going back, I know Eddie was talking about how virtual console games are priced so expensively.

1793
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,520
He sure was.

1794
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:51,520
I could have put that on the N64 games. I think $10 is stupid, especially since that system blew.

1795
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,520
Pokemon Snap, motherfucker. I'd pay $10 for that.

1796
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,520
About a year ago, they were announcing they were considering maybe having all the NES games be free,

1797
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,520
and I mean, I don't see why that would have been out of the question.

1798
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,520
I mean, like you said, the games were like 20 years old.

1799
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,520
They made their money off of them, and now it's like they're selling bits.

1800
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,520
And I could go buy Animal Crossing and get half those games for free.

1801
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:18,520
Yeah, but I honestly think that $8 for SNES games is a pretty fair price.

1802
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,520
I mean, I'd gladly pay $8 for Link.

1803
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,520
Eddie disagrees.

1804
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,520
Why do you disagree?

1805
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,520
I disagree, too.

1806
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,520
Why? Because you guys are poor.

1807
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,520
In part, yes.

1808
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,520
No, I mean, it's just the whole thing.

1809
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,520
I understand they have to pay for setting up for the virtual console,

1810
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,520
but they don't have to pay for actually making cartridges, sending them out, shipping them out.

1811
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:41,520
What if they charge one fee for access to the system?

1812
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:46,520
Let's say you had to pay $20 for Super Nintendo, and then you paid $2 for each game.

1813
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,520
Would you go for that?

1814
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,520
No.

1815
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,520
No.

1816
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,520
Because you don't want to pay anything because you're a cheap, cheap whore.

1817
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,520
Well, I mean, obviously I don't want to pay for shit.

1818
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,520
That's why I get all this free gold, and wow.

1819
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,520
But I just don't think you should have to pay for it.

1820
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,520
Obviously, we're just playing the games for retro reasons or whatever.

1821
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,520
It's not like we really want to obtain the game.

1822
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,520
And also, Nintendo's trying to target that new generation.

1823
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,520
Half of the people who may be playing the Wii have never even played these games before.

1824
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,520
True.

1825
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,520
It doesn't mean they have to charge so much fucking money for it.

1826
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:24,520
Actually, though, I notice a lot of people that are getting into the Wii kind of remember the old NES,

1827
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,520
like the old Mario Brothers and that stuff.

1828
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,520
So I think there's a certain nostalgia value to it, too.

1829
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:36,520
But I don't think there's going to be a lot of people that go, you know, OMG, it's Superstar Soldier,

1830
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,520
because a lot of people probably don't remember that game unless you're hardcore gaming.

1831
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,520
I mean, I'm not going to be holding my breath on virtual console games coming out,

1832
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,520
but it'll be a nice thing to have if I see, oh, look, this game.

1833
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,520
Okay, I haven't played this, and I've been interested in playing it.

1834
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,520
Bam, I'll download it.

1835
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,520
All right, DMN, anything else for our listeners?

1836
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,520
SSJ100, Matt's going to be on STFU this week. That's about it.

1837
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,520
That should be fun.

1838
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,520
STFU Thursday nights right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1839
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,520
Hey, I heard Jimmy was on cross platform this week.

1840
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:09,520
I heard. He didn't tell me until like a couple days ago.

1841
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:16,520
How is it that you guys have accomplished more in like 11, 12 weeks of your program than we've accomplished in five years?

1842
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,520
We model your work ethic.

1843
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,520
Dear DMN, I hate you. Love, Rob.

1844
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,520
No, no, you don't.

1845
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,520
You're right, I don't. Hugs and kisses, DMN.

1846
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,520
Don't be a deck.

1847
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,520
Hey, take care.

1848
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,520
All right.

1849
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:38,520
So, you know, I'm going to make a show that counters STFU, and it's going to be called DIAF.

1850
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,520
Diet of Fire?

1851
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,520
Yeah.

1852
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,520
That'd be good.

1853
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,520
And it's just going to be setting people on fire.

1854
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,520
Good times.

1855
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,520
Last minute stories. Let's go around and get the last minute stories.

1856
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,520
Anybody have anything they want to share?

1857
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,520
I do.

1858
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,520
Okay, yes, Dark Sakura.

1859
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,520
Wand of Blood.

1860
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,520
Dark Sakura will not be seen on next week's program, or any program afterwards, actually.

1861
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,520
Because she'll be playing Wand of Blood. Gosh.

1862
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,520
Actually, I did have something, though, off topic.

1863
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,520
I'm actually not going to be able to be live Tuesday, but the Tuesday after I will be.

1864
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,520
Sweet.

1865
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,520
I have my midterms.

1866
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,520
More Pump Up the Volume goodness.

1867
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,520
Yep, Pump Up the Volume will be back the week after next.

1868
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,520
Awesome.

1869
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,520
Loki, you have anything last minute?

1870
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,520
No.

1871
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,520
Wow, nothing. That's a first. Amazing.

1872
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,520
Well, I don't have anything either, so I guess that's it.

1873
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,520
That's another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Down the Crapper.

1874
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,520
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

1875
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,520
You guys rock.

1876
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,520
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1877
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,520
We'll start off with our special guest tonight.

1878
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,520
Thank you guys so much for being here.

1879
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,520
Rice Princess, your final thought.

1880
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,520
That was a queef, not a fart.

1881
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,520
Okay, thank you for clarifying.

1882
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,520
Wow.

1883
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,520
Casper the Gay, also known as Eddie.

1884
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,520
Your final thought.

1885
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:52,520
Yeah, don't join Rob's face site thing. Join my MySpace at W-I-I-D-D-Y.

1886
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,520
What?

1887
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,520
Nothing.

1888
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,520
Oh, we, I get it. We D.

1889
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,520
I get it because like Eddie, but we.

1890
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,520
Also, I'm really gay.

1891
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,520
That was Rob.

1892
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,520
Loki, your final thought. What are you shopping for on eBay right now?

1893
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:15,520
Analog replacement for my new PSP that I'm going to be getting since I want it repaired by Wednesday.

1894
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,520
My final thought is.

1895
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,520
God, I wish Crackdown was out this week, but I have to wait another week.

1896
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,520
Boo.

1897
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,520
My final thought is reject false icons and.

1898
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,520
Stealing my life.

1899
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,520
I heart you, Jamie.

1900
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,520
Bah.

1901
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,520
Jamie, your final thought.

1902
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,520
Bundle of blood.

1903
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,520
And my other obsession right now is Captain America.

1904
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,520
