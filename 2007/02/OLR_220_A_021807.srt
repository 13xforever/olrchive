Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, February 18th, 2007, new arcade games are revealed, including Tekken 6 and Silent Hill.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Someone in the know violates Microsoft's partner, NetNDA, and could rare be developing something for a Nintendo platform?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and a little bit of gaming culture, geek culture, pop culture types of fare.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm here to help you through the next few hours of Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ah!

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Whoa, the angsty, loud Dark Sakura. How are you?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Um, I hate people.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry to hear it. Why do you hate people?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Because they drive slowly.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And cut me off in traffic.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's always traffic with you, girl. What is it this time?

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No, no, I also hate Starbucks for their extra hot tea that we got for you that scalded me.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I need tea. If you can't tell, my voice is a little bit off tonight again,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
because I was screaming at Rocky last night, and you know, now I'm paying for today.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm still on the tin can mic. Although, I listened to last week's playback,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and what I noticed is that I was very loud, so I apologize for that,

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
so I've adjusted the audio for this week.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's okay, we're used to it.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But on the playback, because it's a lowered bit rate on the podcast,

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
it didn't sound as bad. It didn't sound as tin can.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
As usual?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So I don't think it'll be so bad.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The show sucked, but I was good.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Really?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm just kidding.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm just kidding.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's surprising.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No. What? What the?

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm doing it the whole time, and you're like, lalalalala.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Have you been like snorting crack today?

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, I had a frappuccino.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, goodie.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Here we go, it's another one of those shows.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A crappuccino?

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Say hello as well to Loki.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I forgot that I turned the mic off, so I didn't catch that last comment.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's why I didn't call you a tech mouse to Loki tonight,

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
because apparently you forgot how to work sound equipment. Good job.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The winner is you.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hey.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We hope you have enjoyed.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I know how to use sound equipment.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you?

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All right.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, we have some special guests with us in the studio tonight.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They're extra special. They have their own bus.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's going to be another very interesting week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The feedback from last week is that you guys liked a little bit of the silliness we had going on last week,

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
so we brought some of the silliest people we know to the program.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Say hello to one of the Orange Lounge Radio...

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, god damn it.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, I get the mailbag.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No. No mailbag for you. Sorry.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Apparently none of us remember how to use sound tonight.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Say hello to one of the Orange Lounge Radio lesbians. Chris.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hi, kids.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How are you doing, Chris?

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, I just had Starbucks, so I'm a little bit more awake, so I'm okay.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's been a long weekend.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Propagino. Propagino.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Say hello to one of the Orange Lounge Radio gays, Casper the Gay.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm yummy.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you trying to imitate my voice in the opening?

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And also say hello to somebody brand new.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She's losing her Orange Lounge cherry tonight.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She's brand new to the program.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's Marissa.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hello.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How are you, Marissa?

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I love it when you talk nerdy to me.

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All right.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Marissa is the originator of Uta's brassieres.

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I would like to point out, whatever brassiere Marissa has on tonight, you know, I might be gay, but I can't help but look.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Marissa, you have to do it for the listeners so that they hear the original Uta's brassieres.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Should I do it right now or later?

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Sure. Why not? Why not?

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, the Uta's brassiere thing originated because I am a A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-A-B-H-H-H-H.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
For all you nerds out there, I am wearing a...

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm a geek too. I'm just a music geek.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I am a double G.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So my sisters were complaining about the types of bras that they get to wear.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And I thought this was the most ridiculous thing ever because it is awkward changing in the locker room.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But they have all these choices, you know, spangly this and clear straps this and that and, you know,

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
zebra bras and all they get to wear are Uta's brassieres.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You know, Nazi bras from the Third Reich.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You won't wear them and you will like them.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
In old country, teeth did not fly free.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They were disciplined and they stood at attention like rockets.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So that's where it came from.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Of course, we have our chat room.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We would never have a show complete without our chat room.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is the chat room going insane?

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, the minute Marissa says double G.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Alpha Catagram says double G.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Shadow's Liar says this is the best show ever.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Fire Bulma says keep this girl.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now, because the show is about video games, we need to kind of confess.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Marissa, you're not a hardcore gamer, are you?

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No, because I've been depressed ever since they stopped making King's Quest.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, but so you used to play like the old school adventure games, right?

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, I was obsessed with it, yeah. I was obsessed with all of them.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Have you heard about the King's Quest fan project?

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The Silver Lining? We host the demo on orangeonshooter.com.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I hadn't heard of the brand new one, although I downloaded, I guess,

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sierra as opposed to Sierra and made remakes of the really, really old school ones.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think I downloaded those.

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I remember hearing about that. Cool.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Did you play Space Quest and some of the other stuff too?

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Space Quest, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is my personal favorite.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I love that one. Sam & Max Full Throttle.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
God, you know, I had scum VM on my computer, so I just relived all of my memories on that.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But I didn't get into Siberia, which I was told I was supposed to like Siberia

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
because it was the new adventure game, but it did get a little boring.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sometimes it's tough to live up to the classics, you know, when people say,

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
oh, there's this new game out and it's like the classic.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But then you play it and it's really not, you know.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's true, but I think a lot of the appeal of the adventure games was the humor,

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and Siberia kind of lacked that.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I've been eaten by a grue.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I've got to say, Jared J. in chat says, she loves King's Quest?

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, my God, marry me.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Marissa's taken, yes?

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, yes, but for a little self-whoring,

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
MySpace.com slash Marissa Meisel, M-A-R-I-S-S-A M-E-I-Z-E-L.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's like Marissa Meisel. I'm a musician.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was going to say, you know, of course, when guests come on real radio,

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
they pimp out their stuff, so you're actually a legit musician.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What kind of music do you do?

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Folk rock without it being too whiny.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Folk rock. That's a genre. That's pretty awesome.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Acoustic guitar, yes.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Is that like Enya hardcore?

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Who can say where the dub goes, where the duh-duh, only time.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like Peter, Paul, and Mary with electric guitar.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Puff the Magic Dragon, fuck you.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That whole thing? That's cool.

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All right, I was going to say, as a legitimate musician,

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
what do you think about Guitar Hero?

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is this a good ho-ho-ho or a bad ho-ho-ho?

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay, what? Really quickly so we can get to the crux of the show here.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What do you think of Guitar Hero? Good thing, bad thing?

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I've already sworn on the show. Am I allowed to again?

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's on the Internet. Fuck, shit, cock, cunt, piss, whore, whatever you want.

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I fucking hate Guitar Hero!

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why do you hate Guitar Hero?

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, I guess it's fun, but learning to play guitar gets you laid.

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Playing video game guitar, it's not.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Well, no, it's only good fun, and I like that it brings attention to classic music,

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but the most interesting part is that musicians suck at Guitar Hero,

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
just like real dancers suck at DDR.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's true. They have videos of guys on the Internet

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
playing their own songs on Guitar Heroes, and they fucking suck at them.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Like, it's sad.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's really, really funny.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Meg Z, when she has a Guitar Hero demo set up at her GameStop,

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and they sit there and they ask her,

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
so does this teach you how to play a real guitar?

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She goes, no, it doesn't.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No, but that's what it advertises. No, it doesn't.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And she has to get through to people to tell them it does not teach you how to play guitar.

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I would like to say Jared Jay has changed his mind on Marissa.

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh, shit, now I hate you. Go fuck a goat.

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Go fuck a goat.

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Aw.

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But classic rock is good, huh?

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You'll learn to embrace when the listeners tell you to go fuck things.

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I like go fuck a cactus. That's my favorite.

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Does that give me any points?

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Rice Princess is going to make a cameo real quick.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hi, Irene.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, Marissa, Rice Princess.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Sorry, I'm introducing myself. Hi, Chris.

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Rice Princess, Irene.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, what's up, Rice Princess? How you doing?

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm okay. I'm sick.

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You brought a posse with you. What is this?

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I brought my posse.

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Introduce your posse real quick.

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, this is Chance.

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hey, what's up?

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Real quickly, because we're not going to have time to have everybody on the show.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Chance, what type of games do you like?

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
PS2 games, like RPG games and action games.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Wow.

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Wow and World of Warcraft?

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wow, yeah.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
How about board games like Cold Set? Ever play that?

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
No, I play Axis and Allies and Risk.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh, you're like an old school gamer.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah.

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, you like to do it the slow way. All right, who else is here?

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
My brother, Chris.

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hi, brother Chris.

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What's up?

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What type of games are you into, brother Chris?

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't play video games. They're the devil.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He doesn't play video games.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He plays WoW.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We're not picking him up on the mic either, but he says he doesn't play video games.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm Chris and I am a butt.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
All right, video games suck.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And this is Heather.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hi, Heather.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Hi, Heather. Come up real quick.

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You can't be shy.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
How are you, Heather?

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Great. How are you?

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Good. Do you play video games?

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Kind of. I'm a button masher. Sorry to say.

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Button masher? What type of games do you play? Get the mic a little closer to your mouth.

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Halo, Soul Calibur, Burnout.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Are you any good at Gears of War?

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Never played it.

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We're looking for some good players for Gears of War for something I can't talk about yet,

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
but we need to put together a team for Gears of War, and I'm very scared.

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Interesting.

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Pick that one up and check it out.

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay? And let me know how it goes. All right.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So what is this now, Rice Princess? Is this, like, one of those, like, swelled ego things after the last show?

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You, you know, you got, like, a fan letter, and now you have this swelled ego.

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hey, you know what? I got two.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And she has to have an entourage everywhere she goes.

235
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay, no, no. I got two fan letters now.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah, I'm taking over your show now. Sorry, Rob.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No.

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Now, did you know that I'm moving in again?

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This will be the last week of Orange Lounge Radio.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hope you enjoyed the program while it lasted.

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Shut up.

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
All right.

243
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
All right, anyway.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay, I'm going to let you get back.

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is from show one.

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Irene, you were here for show one, weren't you?

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I totally was.

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That was three studios ago.

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah, seriously, I remember.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
All right, well, just like old times, you should go clean my kitchen.

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Just like old times, I should punch you in your gong.

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
All right.

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
All right, anyway, we got to keep the show moving.

254
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We got to get back to games.

255
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Here you go.

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Let's start. How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

257
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
For my gaming, I did massage.

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Actually, no, we, Dan repaired our whodunnit, so I actually played some pinball.

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And I played, I brought my PS2 over here, and we never played it.

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I heard you brought it over here for Silent Hill,

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
but the meek latov was like, no, my panties are bunched too tight.

262
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't play Silent Hill tonight.

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, I also brought Crazy Taxi, and we didn't play it.

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Crazy money.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
For PS2?

266
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah.

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can only play that on Dreamcast.

268
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I just grabbed a handful of stuff.

270
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
All right.

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Interesting.

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's it?

273
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Really?

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Nothing else?

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's all right.

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's all right.

277
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're a busy girl.

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Can't play games all the time.

279
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

280
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
My gaming week was fun.

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I played all, basically I just played only Crackdown, the full Crackdown.

282
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah, you got the retail release, right?

283
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

284
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, so you're one of those bastards that got it early.

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because street dates don't apply to me.

286
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay, well, sorry.

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So yeah, I'm about two-thirds way through the game already, and it's worth it.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I really cannot wait until everyone else gets it so I can play some co-op.

289
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's actually pretty funny, because if you watch some of the AI, especially the AI drivers,

290
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
they're horrible.

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
In fact, I was trying to kill this one guy, and I heard all this crashing going on below

292
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
me, and there was a freeway below me, so I got on the edge and looked down, and there

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
was this giant pileup of cars, and you can actually see cars being ejected out of the

294
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
tunnel and just getting thrown into the ocean, and it was hilarious, and I had nothing to

295
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
do with it.

296
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It was just the crabby AI drivers just crashed into each other and just launched cars into

297
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
the air.

298
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Some Crackdown comments from our chatroom at chat.orangehonestradio.com.

299
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Let's see, olarmyblaze says, okay, well, whoop-de-fucking-doo, Mr. I work in distribution.

300
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But jeremytel1 has a serious question.

301
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Loki, is the game too easy like I think it will be?

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Like, are all the bosses really easy to kill once you start leveling up?

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It gets harder as you go on, because the first, the Los Maritos bosses are pretty easy, but

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
then when you get to the second, the Volk are a lot harder.

305
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They're not necessarily harder to kill, but it's more elaborate to get to them.

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You can't just climb a building and boom, there they are.

307
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And then everybody starts carrying rocket launchers, and it just gets a little complicated.

308
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So, it does get harder as you go on.

309
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's just, also, I mean, there are three different difficulties, so if you're playing now the

310
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
standard one, it is going to be pretty easy going through the whole game, but, you know,

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
if you want more of a challenge, play on a harder difficulty.

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But I think you'll be, at least, you know, play through the whole game, and then, you

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
know, if you want to go back and play it harder, definitely play the more challenging difficulties.

314
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I think, as it is, it gets kind of hard, especially when you get towards the last gang, the Asian

315
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
gang, it's just, they're crazy, the amount of people that they throw at you, so, I don't

316
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
know, it does get harder, though.

317
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Alright.

318
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Anything else at your gaming week besides Crackdown?

319
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories still.

320
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Still, after all this time.

321
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh yeah, we'll be playing until the next game comes out.

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Alright.

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
One other question here, Jay Dorian asks, low-key, how does the full game's world compare

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
to the demo?

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
How much bigger does it feel?

326
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Well, the demo, it was just pretty much half of the first island, it's not even the whole

327
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
first island, and the game feels huge, I mean, like, you get, I can't recognize certain areas

328
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
of the game, I mean, you can get lost pretty easy in it, so it does feel very large, it's,

329
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
there's a ton of places to explore, I've been practically everywhere in these last, the

330
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
first two islands or whatever, and I've only found about less than a third of the secret

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
orbs, and just over half of the agility orbs, and I'm already, I've already maxed out my

332
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:31,000
strength, and I'm about to max out my explosives, so it's, I mean, it, there's just a ton of

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
stuff to explore.

334
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I did like the achievement, there's one achievement for killing people with this globe, it's a

335
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
giant globe that you find at the observatory.

336
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Is it like the Lochmar?

337
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No.

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's like a giant, like, metal globe, and you have to kill 15 people with it, and that

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
was fun.

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you bowl them over or something?

341
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Something like that, you basically kind of toss it onto them.

342
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Throw it at their head.

343
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah, throw it at their head.

344
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Interesting.

345
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I kill people all the time by throwing things at their head.

346
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's just, the fun part's gonna be coming to, I think, the co-op gameplay, because you

347
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
can just run around and do whatever the fuck you want in that game, that's gonna be fun,

348
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and what's kind of neat about it, and you don't really notice this in the demo, the

349
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
full game, you can actually have people jump in and out of your game while you're playing,

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
so.

351
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I heard about that, that sounds pretty intuitive, but is that as good as it sounds, you think?

352
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, it's just gonna be people jumping in and out, and you don't necessarily have to

353
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
play with them, they'll just, you know, they can go fuck around in your city or whatever,

354
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
so that's gonna be kind of cool, and then, I think, I remember hearing a long time ago

355
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that one of the downloads that they were gonna have for Crackdown was a replay editor or

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
something like that, where you can record your own gameplay, so that might be pretty

357
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
fun to share that with people.

358
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Anything else?

359
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's it.

360
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Alright, real quickly, I haven't done a lot this week.

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I finally have taken a WoW character, World of Warcraft, further than I ever have before.

362
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
My character finally hit level 30, so I got, thank you, thank you.

363
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I got Cheetah Form finally, and I'm halfway to 60, but now that means nothing, because

364
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
70 is the new cap, so.

365
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But, as I swore to myself before, if I make it all the way to 40, I will finally buy Burning

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Crusade, because that means I must actually be into Warcraft enough.

367
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't have Burning Crusade yet, because I don't see the point of getting it, if I'm

368
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
not gonna.

369
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Blood elves!

370
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Blood elves are awesome, but seriously, on my server, everyone is playing Blood elves.

371
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Everyone.

372
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah, I'll talk about that later.

373
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Alright, and then I also played Paperboy, which is awesome.

374
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
On the Xbox 360, the old game, it translates pretty well to the Xbox 360, I gotta say,

375
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
because the game itself was kinda widescreen, like a little bit, like if you remember the

376
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
old cabinet it was in, it was kinda widescreen, so they didn't have to smush it or anything,

377
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and the vertical bars aren't quite as big.

378
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The achievements are kinda smart, they're not like really super duper easy, but not

379
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
super duper hard either, like the previous games, but I think Paperboy itself was a much

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
harder game than I remember.

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Paperboy is one of those few truly original games, so definitely I recommend you guys

382
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
check out the demo if you're 360 owners, because if you never played Paperboy, at least play

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
the first level that the demo gives you, I think you'll find it's creative enough and

384
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
original enough of a game to necessitate buying the full game.

385
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And they have co-op modes, and I think there's a competitive mode, I can't remember, because

386
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I haven't taken it online yet, because most of my week's been on Warcraft, unfortunately.

387
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I tried to get more achievements in Fusion Frenzy 2, but honestly, I couldn't tolerate

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
the game long enough to do it.

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Like I got so fed up, I was like, oh my god, this game sucks, I turned it off.

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I was like, it's not worth it.

391
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't care what achievement point challenges are going on right now, I will earn them somewhere

392
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
else.

393
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I can't do it.

394
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Fusion Frenzy 2 is just that bad.

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Chris, how was your gaming week?

396
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I have become a World of Warcraft nerd.

397
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Congratulations!

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, clap for me, I need it.

399
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah, I just, I'm on only two of the servers, one is the noob one, which is where everyone

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
starts out.

401
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hydraxis, I think?

402
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't know, I can't pronounce names.

403
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And I've got like ten characters on there that haven't even reached level 15.

404
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's alright, you've got to start somewhere.

405
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah, and then I've got, but I have Burning Crusades, because if I'm going to get it,

406
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm going to get all of it.

407
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And it's really funny, on both the elves, because you know, when you start off a new

408
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
character, they all start with that little cinema, and they all say it with the elves,

409
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
it's like, it's like the elves, like, the last of their races, everybody is a fucking

410
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
elf!

411
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Everyone is a blood elf, everyone is a night elf, they're all over, like, they're all

412
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
over the frickin' place, it's like, last of my, last of the race, my ass.

413
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But the Draenei, oh my god, I don't care what anyone says, those things are hot.

414
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I love the Draenei.

415
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The Draenei girls are pretty hot.

416
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Ugh, their Russian accents make me horny.

417
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Please don't hold back.

418
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I love those things so much, I think they were supposed to be something else, but I

419
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
like them being aliens, it's amusing.

420
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Every time I hear the Draenei females speak, though, I can't help but think, Boris, look,

421
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
it's Musen's room!

422
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah, it was, it's like, not enough rage!

423
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You know, I just love those things.

424
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So, if anyone wants to find me, I get, I mean, go to Jamie's MySpace, I'm on MySpace, so

425
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're in my top eight.

426
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
She's in, I'm in her top eight.

427
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're in the Orange Lounge top, actually.

428
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I am?

429
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You are.

430
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I feel so special.

431
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You are.

432
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah, send me a note, I'll tell you who I am.

433
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Seriously, I suck, I don't know how to type in general yet.

434
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You know how, like, when you, so if somebody knows, please inform me.

435
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I seriously don't, I know how, like, I know how to type.

436
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You type slash one.

437
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Really?

438
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Slash one, space, and then whatever you want to say.

439
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, god dammit.

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You know, it's just like, interesting things pop up, and it's really funny when the Horde

441
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
shows up.

442
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's like, because they got, like, a 60, like, what is it, a 70 level Horde came in the other

443
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
day, and like, there was like a billion people on that, on the server, and they all ganged

444
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
up on the Horde, and the Horde's sitting there like, ah, I killed everything, we killed

445
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the Horde.

446
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I love the Horde, I love the Horde.

447
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I have actually a lot of Horde characters.

448
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's good.

449
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,160
It's just really funny when they show up, because I think they're all, the one, someone

450
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,480
explained to me, the Alliance is a bunch of noobs, who don't know, like, children who

451
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,000
don't know anything, and the Horde is a bunch of assholes.

452
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, so I'm on the Horde side, definitely.

453
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah, of course.

454
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I've got both, but.

455
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Well, now that they have blood elves, you're starting to see a lot of the noob-ness on

456
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the Horde side.

457
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,840
The blood elf males are the only ones that I can stand, because they're not all butch.

458
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Well, they're very gay.

459
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
I know, I love them.

460
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,880
They're so, it's like, can I help you?

461
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm looking, and Uni is jumping up and down, going, ooh, it's slash one, type slash one.

462
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Thank you.

463
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Uni's being very helpful.

464
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Thank you.

465
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
She's noob-friendly.

466
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,600
Some people come up to me, you know what, that game is the most, WoW is the most frustrating

467
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,240
fucking game in the world, because there are people walking around you, and I'm not used

468
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
to that.

469
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
I'm not used to MMOs.

470
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
I've never played them.

471
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,320
And so, somebody comes up to me, do you want to duel?

472
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
No, thank you, decline.

473
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,120
Five seconds later, do you want to duel by the same frickin' person over and over and

474
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
over again?

475
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,000
I had to tell this guy, leave me the fuck alone, I'm on a quest, I have to get the candles.

476
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,240
Or what was Irene's story from, I think she told it on the air last week, she said something

477
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,380
about make wool, or something, and the guy traded the wool, and was like, no, I don't

478
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,580
do cloth guarding.

479
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,000
Back me wool, please.

480
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,880
Which totally didn't speak English, it was great.

481
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,120
So now her character is actually named back me wool.

482
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Back me wool.

483
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
It's awesome.

484
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,320
So when you guys all come into Ravencrest to play on the official server of Orzammar

485
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm going to get back and play, Aerie Peak, hi.

486
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,160
Oh no, we all band in Aerie Peak.

487
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,680
Aerie Peak, the problem with Aerie Peak, it's the first one on the list alphabetically.

488
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,400
Oops, none of us ever thought of that, so Aerie Peak went downhill real quick.

489
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Ooh.

490
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
You can pay for my account and I'll play again.

491
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Pay for your account, Jamie.

492
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
No, set up a PayPal.

493
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I'll pay for your account.

494
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Don't give me that look!

495
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:52,080
God, she gives me that look every time I offer to pay for something, shut up!

496
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,560
We'll talk about it after the show.

497
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Okay.

498
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Oh, I got that look.

499
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,560
I'm gonna get that look.

500
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,560
All you need to do is some sweet lovin'.

501
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,680
So I'm gonna go on break right now, hey guys, let's go in here, there's two of us.

502
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Yeah, we'll be right back, guys.

503
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Wow, wow.

504
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
All right.

505
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
They're fighting.

506
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,520
This is the hottest episode of Orange Lounge ever.

507
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,040
I can't believe we're offering to eat pussy over World of Warcraft.

508
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,720
Girls are gonna eat each other out over World of Warcraft.

509
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,520
Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.

510
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.

511
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,720
Hey, to quote Randall, I love the cock.

512
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,480
I just had to defend myself here.

513
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
All right.

514
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
Oh, sorry.

515
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
All right.

516
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Cock-loving Marissa.

517
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,960
Wait, wait, wait, how many of us have shoes off?

518
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
I have my shoes off.

519
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
My half-Japanese boyfriend would kick my ass.

520
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,040
If Marissa takes off her shoes, then it's Mississippi orgy.

521
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Mississippi orgy!

522
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
All right.

523
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Woo!

524
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,400
Explain the Mississippi orgy thing again for anybody who's new.

525
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,200
State law in Mississippi is that if three or more people, and at least one of them is,

526
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,720
I think, no, it's three more people with one person of an opposite gender in the room,

527
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,440
it's an orgy.

528
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
With your socks and shoes off.

529
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Or with your shoes off.

530
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
I'm sorry.

531
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
There you go.

532
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,880
We are having a Mississippi orgy on Orange Lounge radio.

533
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,600
Jeremy Todd 1 says, I disagree, Rob.

534
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,800
The episode with the Mississippi orgy was the hottest episode ever.

535
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Well, here you go.

536
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,440
That's why I told Marissa to take off her shoes.

537
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,760
Return of the Mississippi orgy.

538
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,680
Now we need some shine and we're set.

539
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Marissa, I know you're not the biggest gamer in the world, but has there been anything

540
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
you've been playing lately?

541
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,000
Actually, I bought my first gaming system ever because I was just so obsessed with reliving

542
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,880
the adventure games with ScummVM that I actually finally went out and I bought a DS.

543
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,000
I'd like to personally thank Nintendo, I swear to God, for bringing women back into gaming

544
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,320
because every chick I know is so excited about the Wii.

545
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,880
So yeah, that's the first gaming system where I actually went, ooh, I want it.

546
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,780
You know, this is a very profound thing we're talking about here because from our perspective

547
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,780
as hardcore gamers, you're always reading on the game blogs about Nintendo's trying

548
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,920
to get the casual gamers back into gaming.

549
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,160
How can we get the casual gamers back into gaming?

550
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,440
So I ask you, you're saying the DS is the first system you have ever bought with your

551
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,480
own money.

552
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
What made you do it?

553
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,520
Well, I've always been broke so that has something to do with the fact that I didn't have one

554
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
before.

555
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:21,680
Quite frankly, PC gaming isn't the equivalent to a game system.

556
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,960
She wants Link's ass.

557
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
What?

558
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,320
She wants Link's ass.

559
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,920
The Rob D says, every chick I know is excited about the Wii.

560
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
I know, every chick.

561
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,360
Oh, the gaming system, never mind.

562
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Get it?

563
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,680
Uh-huh, uh-huh, give me that.

564
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,240
The DS just offered something completely new as far as the touchscreen interface and you

565
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,760
could play Game Boy Advance, which was cool, you know, double deal.

566
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
And it's accessible.

567
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,920
I mean, it really is for people like me who are kind of dyslexic and all the buttons and

568
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,720
the functions, et cetera.

569
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,280
You know, and that's what they say.

570
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,940
Is it the fact that you look at an Xbox 360 controller and you're like, too many buttons.

571
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
What the fuck is that?

572
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,940
That's a spaceship.

573
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,840
Well, the original controller was a fucking spaceship for the original Xbox, that is.

574
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,800
But yeah, I mean, I think it could potentially get people into gaming again because it seems

575
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,400
like there isn't a single, I mean, I'm sure that there can be some recommendations, but

576
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,760
there aren't a lot of mainstream ways to just completely reintroduce somebody into gaming

577
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,320
who's used to the, you know, classic Nintendo, ah, God bless it, you know, two-button interface.

578
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,120
So I think that the Wii is a great, you know, I think they ultimately could become more

579
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,920
successful with more complicated gaming, et cetera.

580
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,640
But Cooking Mama is fun.

581
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,440
Oh, God, not another one.

582
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Cooking Mama.

583
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Oh, God.

584
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

585
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
I actually, I'm burnt out on it though, I will admit.

586
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,920
I went off the show.

587
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:59,440
A very special listener sent me pictures of Mama cosplay, which you'll hear about later.

588
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,560
Can I tell the Mama cosplayer, go outside, please?

589
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,120
It's on my phone, I'll show you, the Mama cosplayer was great.

590
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,760
You also need to go outside.

591
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,120
You know what, you need to bite my ass, but to quote Chris in a non-literal sense.

592
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,600
I do have to complain though, and this is really old school gaming, but my friend told

593
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,840
me to try to get into RPGs to try Morrowind, and I bought a video game to play, not to

594
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,080
read, not to walk every fucking where, I just had to say that.

595
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,280
However, here's a really awesome picture of me in a hat.

596
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,080
Have you ever, actually speaking of Morrowind, have you ever played Elder Scrolls Oblivion,

597
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
ever?

598
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,320
Like, it's kind of an adventure game, it's pretty as hell, off the show to you some day.

599
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
No, I haven't.

600
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
It's very pretty.

601
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
It's fun.

602
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,960
Well, I don't have an Xbox, but Chris has an Xbox, yes.

603
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
It's for 360.

604
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,200
He plays black all the time.

605
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,720
Wow, who's doing that cosplay, do we know?

606
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
That's funny.

607
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
It's some convention.

608
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
That's great.

609
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
See someone calling Mama.

610
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Oh, is that something Mama sent you from the, oh, my bad, am I not supposed to spoil?

611
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
For the record.

612
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,480
I love that look, Jamie.

613
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Stop pouting.

614
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Bad Rob.

615
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
So cute.

616
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
Bad Rob.

617
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,280
All right, then let's keep the show moving so we can get to some news and whatever it

618
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
is.

619
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
I'll show you movement.

620
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
All right.

621
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
Bowel movement.

622
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,480
All right, anyhow, let's get to some gaming news, thankfully, oh, God, yes, we need some

623
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,560
gaming news here on this program.

624
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
So who's going to start us off tonight?

625
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Oh, I know, we actually talk about games once in a while.

626
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,520
In fact, get this, you know what, Chris, we actually get some exclusives.

627
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,560
Those are like things you haven't heard anywhere else yet.

628
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,920
Oh, my God, really?

629
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Exactly.

630
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
So, Loki.

631
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
That's amazing.

632
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Loki's going to tell us.

633
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
She sounds like she's coming.

634
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Never mind.

635
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,360
Why don't you all go back to whatever you were doing before?

636
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,280
Just, all right.

637
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,840
Anyways, so like last week how we had some exclusive dates for the Microsoft games, today

638
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,840
we come with a brand new company, Midway.

639
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,520
We have a whole lineup for their games and the core subject of the change, you know,

640
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,120
like a certain Halo 3 date, you know, which I still believe that that game.

641
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,280
Oh, yes, I forgot to mention the Halo 3 official teaser came out this week and there it is

642
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,780
right there, Fall 2007.

643
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,560
And Loki had said on this show previously, what, April or May or something?

644
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
May, but...

645
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Wrong.

646
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,160
Well, here's why, okay, and I have a couple reasons why I think they're doing this.

647
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,680
One, it's a big Christmas, you know, they don't have a big Christmas game coming out.

648
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,920
Two, I think they thought that the PlayStation 3 was going to be in a better position to,

649
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,800
you know, where there might actually be a threat.

650
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,200
You know, right now I don't see PlayStation 3s flying off the shelves and they certainly

651
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,520
don't have the lineup for it, so, you know, you don't need to put the game out right now.

652
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,200
And to be honest, I think the game will probably be done by May, but they'll just hold it until

653
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,140
Christmas, you know, so they can capitalize on that stuff.

654
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,800
So lesson learned about the distribution dates, I mean, we've said it before, this isn't anything

655
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,800
we didn't tell you when we said the Halo 3 date the first time, dates are subject to

656
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
change.

657
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,520
Retailers push things back all the time, you read about this on blogs, so we can tell you

658
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,640
how things are now, but unforeseen circumstances will push games back.

659
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,920
One perfect example of this would be Stranglehold for PlayStation 3 and the 360.

660
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,440
Originally that was scheduled to be out, what, December of last year, and now it's pushed

661
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,120
all the way, it's my birthday by the way, September 11th, and it'll be also available

662
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,560
in the collector's edition, which is, it looks like a pretty cool game, you know, John Woo

663
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,360
and stuff.

664
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,040
Anyways, Mortal Kombat Armageddon for the Wii is scheduled to come out April 18th, and

665
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,240
that looks actually pretty fun.

666
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,480
Also we'll be getting Hour of Victory on the Xbox 360, yet another World War II first person

667
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,280
shooter.

668
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,200
Also Blacksite Area 51, also scheduled for September, September 12th on PlayStation 3

669
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,540
and 360.

670
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:47,040
Also in September, Unreal Tournament 3 on the 360, that's the 19th.

671
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:55,840
And then Mortal Kombat's coming out on the DS on October 17th, why?

672
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,920
I mean has there ever been a good handheld Mortal Kombat, ever, ever?

673
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,080
If you have a Nomad.

674
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Okay I don't.

675
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,480
Well, a Nomad's just a Genesis.

676
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
But you said handheld.

677
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
That's cheating.

678
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
No it's not.

679
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
You cheated.

680
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,680
You're a cheating cheater.

681
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,000
Also scheduled the same date, Wheelman, on PlayStation 3 and 360, that brand new Vin Diesel

682
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,380
movie slash game, that's going to be coming out.

683
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,120
Some other interesting stuff from Nintendo, they're going to have the official Nintendo

684
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,560
headset for the DS coming out April 22nd, and a couple delays, well actually one delay

685
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,720
here for you, MLB 07, the show for the PlayStation 3 has been delayed to April 24th.

686
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
So yay.

687
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
Lots of dates.

688
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,720
All right, well thank you very much for those dates.

689
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,060
Looking at the chatroom, Fireboma says Mortal Kombat better be Wi-Fi.

690
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Maybe that's the reason to have it on DS.

691
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,060
Actually, Tekken Dark Resurrection, that's a good point.

692
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
Who said that?

693
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,060
That is a good point.

694
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,060
There was also...

695
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,060
Alpha Canagram.

696
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,060
Good job.

697
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,040
Mortal Kombat Deception's Unchained on the PSP that came out in November.

698
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,680
All right, so I think back to those crappy Game Boy ones.

699
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Come on.

700
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Surely you played...

701
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,960
Like they had characters cut out of them, and they were bad.

702
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Oh, Game Boy.

703
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,640
I mean, come on, you can't really play a game with like two buttons anyway.

704
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
Why bother?

705
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,720
At least with the DS, you've got six buttons, so you can at least do kind of what you had

706
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,360
on the Super Nintendo, at the very least.

707
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,800
All right.

708
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,680
Well, speaking of things that are announced, this time in the arcade, we don't talk about

709
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,660
the arcade scene an awful lot, but obviously, if you know the history of Orange Lounge Radio,

710
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,280
we started as a station for the first few years we were doing this, we were strictly

711
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,520
about music games and what was going on with the music-based games.

712
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,200
So of course, Dance Dance Revolution is a game we've loved for a long time.

713
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,760
That's how we all met, actually, was through DDR.

714
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:45,040
So with great pleasure, we can talk about DDR Supernova 2, which was officially announced

715
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,560
at AOU 2007.

716
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,720
Of course, DDR kind of came back after a little slumber.

717
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,980
DDR hibernated for a little while and came back with Supernova last year.

718
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,700
And now, that's all you have, though, is there was a little teaser poster that just said

719
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,120
Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2.

720
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
That's really all we know.

721
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,840
It's coming, but that's a good sign.

722
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,880
Are you surprised?

723
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,240
For me, yes, because it's arcade.

724
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,880
If this was a home version, no, that's not a surprise at all.

725
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,920
But as far as a arcade release goes, yeah, I think it is a little bit of a surprise.

726
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,360
Because of the fact that DDR took such a long break, I think to get a new game announced

727
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,840
so quickly, despite the rumors of the 200, 300 song expansion, whatever it is, which

728
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,360
is probably this, I think it's great.

729
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,320
I wonder what that says, because I can't read Japanese, obviously.

730
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,960
So it says 2000, I wonder if it's like spring, fall, summer.

731
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,200
Let me give it a look, but I will do that after I deliver some other news to us.

732
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,840
Why the hell does this look like, I want to say, like some crappy Pokemon logo or something?

733
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Where's the damn poster?

734
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,440
Because Pokemon's very lame.

735
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,840
Chris has problems with you calling Pokemon lame.

736
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,360
And Pokemon is the only game that I really, truly loved first.

737
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,320
You know, DDR Supernova 2, I think it's going to be a Jewish game, if you notice there's

738
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,000
like almost like a Star of David in the background there.

739
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Wow.

740
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,080
You know, our resident Jew in the room has made a face in regards to that.

741
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:32,320
Actually, Loki's married to a Jew too, so he gets to make the jokes through proxy.

742
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,840
He's into Judaism, if you know what I mean.

743
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,160
Marissa's boyfriend is half Japanese with a very Japanese mother, so she gets to make

744
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,080
all the Japanese jokes, so she's okay by proxy too.

745
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
There you go, alright.

746
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
Good.

747
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,840
Do I get to make Jewish jokes because I know you?

748
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,680
But I am!

749
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
Dammit.

750
00:34:51,680 --> 00:35:02,720
Okay, I do believe that that says, looking at that, that is, I want to say winter.

751
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,840
I'm pretty sure that that's the kanji for 2007 winter.

752
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,800
Kyle Snyder's in chat, who's somewhat of a well-known DDR persona.

753
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Hi Kyle!

754
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,280
And he thinks the following will show up in Supernova 2.

755
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,320
These are the official Kyle Snyder predictions.

756
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,400
Fly Away remix, Stargate Heaven, Future Love mix, Flow, Jem and Reggae mix, VJ Army, G2

757
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,640
and Outer Limits.

758
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,880
I wouldn't mind if VJ Army showed up.

759
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
That would be rad.

760
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Alright.

761
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Well, you know what else is absolutely completely 100% rad and even more super cool than DDR?

762
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,880
Me.

763
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Me!

764
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
Your mom is cooler than DDR.

765
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,640
Which is true because I like your mom.

766
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Your mom's really cool.

767
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
Okay.

768
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,360
But not in a, not in a, you know.

769
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
Not in a homosexual way.

770
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
Not in a MILF way.

771
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
Okay.

772
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
Alright.

773
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,280
Um, but Silent Hill is coming to the arcade, and yes, I know, everybody already knows about

774
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,040
it, so shut up.

775
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
There is...

776
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,160
Orange Lounge Radio reporting the news you already know about.

777
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:06,040
There is a Silent Hill in development for the arcade, not really major too much about

778
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,360
it out, it's just called Silent Hill the Arcade, supposed to be a gun game with a big curtain

779
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
around it and...

780
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
That's like a lasso.

781
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
Ooh, Pyramid Head.

782
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,960
But, um, it looks really blurry.

783
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,600
Well, I'm thinking it's just going for the look of Silent Hill, like it's probably going

784
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,760
to be foggy and have that whole ambience to it.

785
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,400
I'm sorry, the PlayStation 2 looked better than that.

786
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,140
That curtain's gotta go.

787
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,140
That curtain isn't gonna last.

788
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,140
That curtain that's on the thing, though, yeah.

789
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,960
Little kids at Golf Land will rip that shit off in five seconds.

790
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,920
My whole fear regarding this, though, is that it's gonna turn and it's gonna be like House

791
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,360
of the Dead clone, and it better not be, or I will personally go to Konami of Japan with

792
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,520
a tank.

793
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,440
I will tape that.

794
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,080
If Akira Yomoka has anything to do with this, I'm okay with it, because I know I respect

795
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,080
that man so much.

796
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,960
If it's really cool, I will personally, I mean, hug him.

797
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,640
Mercy, are you a big Silent Hill fan?

798
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,640
I'm sorry, Chris, we were not making it up to you.

799
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,240
I don't go see a lot of movies, not because I'm a hermit, because I don't like paying

800
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
eight dollars and seeing a movie that sucks.

801
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,240
I drive my feet, stick to the floor, and the smell of vomit or whatever else goes on in

802
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,600
the theater.

803
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
So I haven't seen a lot of movies.

804
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,040
Do you like scary games?

805
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,800
You ever thought about playing a scary video game?

806
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,760
I was the best girlfriend in the world when I bought my boyfriend, who couldn't afford

807
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
anything.

808
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,040
I bought him a, neither could I, technically, I bought him a GameCube, and god damn it,

809
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
I'm having an eternal darkness.

810
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
Resident Evil 4.

811
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,640
I bought him Resident Evil for the GameCube, and he just had a heart attack.

812
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,280
I like the suspenseful games, but sometimes they can just piss you off, and make you want

813
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,320
to kill something, like in the game.

814
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Trauma Sender!

815
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,200
Trauma Sender is amazing!

816
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,000
Trauma Sender makes me want to kill things.

817
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Oh!

818
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,160
Stab your knife into the patient.

819
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,320
I love, that's my favorite thing to do when I get frustrated in Trauma Centers, I just

820
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,600
whip out the scalpel and go, just start stabbing the patient.

821
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Just start trying to kill the patient.

822
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Exactly.

823
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,520
You know what I like to do in Trauma Center now that I'm in school to be a massage therapist?

824
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,120
Let's begin the operation!

825
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,840
I like tracing out their muscles, because I know where they are now.

826
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,880
Blaze says Trauma Center equals love.

827
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,400
By the way, just because I'm proud of myself, I made a 92 on my anatomy test.

828
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Yay!

829
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Back to games.

830
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Can I get a technical geek on?

831
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Can I get a technical geek on?

832
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Is that a SM58?

833
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
I have no idea.

834
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:32,400
So now I totally know how to relax the piriformis when you have sciatic pain.

835
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:39,480
Speaking of Silent Hill, when does this come out?

836
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,480
I did know, and then I closed the article.

837
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Let me down.

838
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
No!

839
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,000
No, they don't actually say.

840
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,480
I just hope the curtain was just to protect the press at this arcade show, because that

841
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
curtain is so old.

842
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,280
It would only be in America that the curtain would be in any game.

843
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,760
The curtain was basically to give it a dark, eerie feeling.

844
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,000
The curtain gives you the feeling of playing it in a hefty bag.

845
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That's what the curtain gives you the feeling of.

846
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,520
If they want to really make it a thing, they should do it like how that crap-tastic Jurassic

847
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:22,280
Park game is, where you can sit down.

848
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:30,240
If they come out with the typing of the Silent Hill, I will retire from video game everything,

849
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,120
because everything I need in the world has been done.

850
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,760
I still play Typing of the Dead.

851
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,400
What if it were like Guitar Freaks crossed with Silent Hill?

852
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
That's stupid.

853
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,800
It would be Ki-Tar that you read.

854
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,240
Pyramid Head rocks out.

855
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,680
You have to fight them with the power of rock.

856
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,400
That's Guitaro Man gone lame.

857
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,720
No, we should have Silent Ki-Tar.

858
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Cassio the Shooting!

859
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,560
You can kill them with Hall and Oates, okay?

860
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,600
You can kill anyone with Hall and Oates.

861
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,360
Speaking of slightly lame, let's talk about Tekken 6.

862
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,880
Yes, Tekken 6 is slightly lame.

863
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Why?

864
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,200
Because the screenshots in the trailer that they've shown of it look kind of lame.

865
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,920
And not even really up to par to Virtua Fighter 5.

866
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,920
But nonetheless, we'll be coming to arcades soon.

867
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,680
And we'll be featuring also two new characters, Leo and Zafina.

868
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,760
Both of which look very generic.

869
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,480
So hooray.

870
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,600
But it looks like it will have the same visual quality of Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.

871
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
And um...

872
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,700
Okay, wait, what were the characters' names again, Leo?

873
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Leo and Zafina.

874
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,040
Okay, now keep in mind I've never seen pictures of these characters.

875
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,400
I don't even know if they've leaked out.

876
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,280
But I'm going to make some bold predictions, okay, knowing the Tekken series.

877
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,280
I'm going to say Leo is shirtless.

878
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:10,840
And Zafina has humongous breasts that will bounce.

879
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,000
You're wrong about shirtless.

880
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,560
Every character in Tekken is shirtless.

881
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,280
Even one of the chicks, I think.

882
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,400
Leo looks like a chick, who also looks like someone that was ripped from Final Fantasy

883
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
X.

884
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,080
No, Leo looks like one of the Bogards, a little bit.

885
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,600
Okay, Leo looks like a chick, anyways.

886
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
And then...

887
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
That's a guy.

888
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:44,680
And then Zafina, well, she's your chick that's, you know, of course she has big boobs, but...

889
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,680
She's your...

890
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
You ain't bad.

891
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
Your ethnic chick.

892
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
What, is she a belly dancer?

893
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,680
What the hell is that?

894
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
Probably.

895
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,680
Your belly...

896
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,680
That's so wrong.

897
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
I don't know.

898
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,680
Oh well, easy access, I suppose.

899
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,800
Either way, it looks kind of neat.

900
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,440
They're going to have, it looks like from the trailer, they're going to have different

901
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,360
ways you can kind of build up your characters and stuff.

902
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,780
I don't know, it looks okay, but really, do you really need to push better graphics with

903
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
fighting games?

904
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,780
Just make it fun.

905
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,780
Yay.

906
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,780
Yay for that, actually.

907
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,720
Marisa says she's yay for that.

908
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
Alright.

909
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,440
So they do need to push more boob physics with Dead or Alive 3, or Dead or Alive 5,

910
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
I guess that would be.

911
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,920
Jamie, you're a Tekken fangirl, are you excited about Tekken 6, or is this a little too much

912
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,440
of one thing, or what?

913
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,560
I'm always excited over anything that has Jin in it.

914
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,320
Yeah, I was going to say, as long as Jin's in it, right?

915
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,880
And Asuka now, because Asuka's kind of...

916
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,440
Well here, I'm going to write a letter on Jamie's behalf to Namco.

917
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Dear Namco...

918
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
May I?

919
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
May I?

920
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
May I?

921
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
May I?

922
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
Sit down.

923
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,440
Shut up.

924
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Let me speak.

925
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Okay, here we go.

926
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Rob, you talk too much.

927
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
I know.

928
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Even our fans think so too.

929
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
No, I know.

930
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
It's funny.

931
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
Okay, then here's my letter.

932
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Dear fans, suck it.

933
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Alright, here we go, back to Jamie's letter.

934
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
No, no, that's G4.

935
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
Dear Namco Bandai.

936
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Jin!

937
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

938
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
No, no, no, no.

939
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
Love, Jamie.

940
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,440
No, no, no.

941
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,440
Jin has also carried over to Asuka.

942
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
P.S.

943
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,440
Asuka!

944
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
P.S.

945
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,560
Oh my god, boobs.

946
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,440
Mike W. says, my ears bleed.

947
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,320
Rondo of Blood, the fighting game.

948
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,200
Fireboma says, write it in blood.

949
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,160
Uni says, I'm going to smack Rob for not being nice to D.S.

950
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
I bite back.

951
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,560
For the record, I'm so sick of how many shadows your game could fucking render if it still

952
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
sucks.

953
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,920
For the record.

954
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,160
That's how we feel, but we don't know how to put it so eloquently to the developers.

955
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,400
Would you like to write a letter to the developers of games?

956
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
What if it went like that?

957
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Alright.

958
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:56,260
It's like, great, now you have a really shiny, highly rendered piece of shit.

959
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:02,320
That dookie looks mighty fine, I mean, I can see like, it's obvious you ate corn.

960
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:10,080
It's like, wow, she looks really lifelike, too bad that she clips through people and

961
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,080
is stuck in the stage.

962
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,760
I love the blood elves in World of Warcraft because they levitate over bridges because

963
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,440
the clipping is so awful.

964
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,040
In certain places they do.

965
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,520
Anyhow, let's talk about something very sexy.

966
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,940
Besides me, Ikaruga is a shooter game.

967
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,940
You know Ikaruga, right?

968
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,560
It's like the one where you press buttons to change the color of your show because there's

969
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,520
like red bullets and I think it was purple bullets and red bullets.

970
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,160
It's like black and white, but the black is kind of purplish.

971
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
It's so awesome.

972
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,600
You have these bullets and you need to change the color, it's such a great shooter.

973
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,600
What's happening is that Ikaruga is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade and the way

974
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,520
they found this out was on an Xbox 360 debug unit through the partner net.

975
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,800
And I think somebody a little later is going to be talking a little more about this whole

976
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,520
partner net leak thing, but certainly Ikaruga was the highlight of the games announced for

977
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,520
that, so that's very sexy.

978
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
Ikaruga is sexy.

979
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
Ikaruga is a sexy ass game.

980
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,800
We need radiant silver guns still though.

981
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,880
So I'm very excited about that, that'll be awesome.

982
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,560
Ikaruga, that is just like so, well I'll tell you something else though that's relatively

983
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,780
sexy.

984
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:25,800
That is if you are a big collector like me and a SKU has shown up at GameCrazy, which

985
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:31,080
I cannot confirm for my husband's GameCrazy because he hasn't seen fit to tell me, sorry,

986
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:37,560
for a black Xbox 360 and it has been confirmed by several GameCrazies.

987
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:43,160
Isn't this like the fourth week in a row there's been some type of black Xbox 360 story on

988
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
the internet?

989
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,200
Yes, and GamersReports.com would like to let you know that they had the story first because

990
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,360
it's posted on every single follow up story.

991
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,340
It's on every freaking gaming site once, look I don't give a shit about that.

992
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:03,180
What I want to ask about is who cares, take a Sharpie to the Xbox 360 you have now and

993
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,160
make it black if you care that much.

994
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
Dark Soccer, why?

995
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,320
The original Xbox was black.

996
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,800
But we had the Halo one.

997
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,360
Yeah but here's the thing though about it, I think it's not really a fact that it's black,

998
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,660
it's just that it's going to have a 120 gig hard drive supposedly and they think that's

999
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,000
also going to have an HDMI out.

1000
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,240
I can tell you right now.

1001
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,240
And a bigger penis.

1002
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,800
I can tell you right now either way it's just going to be a disappointment.

1003
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,180
That's all it's going to be is a big disappointment for you.

1004
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:38,200
So great they're going to announce that, they're going to announce the 512 card or memory unit

1005
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,920
or whatever and everybody's like oh yay we can download more crap.

1006
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:49,640
I'm sorry I just had to weigh in on this subject because I think Nintendo, it's the stupidest

1007
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,640
thing in the world but I think they made a big mistake with the GameCube.

1008
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,440
Well actually I got my X for the GameCube but they made it purple.

1009
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,840
Because guys were afraid of having a purple GameCube.

1010
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,320
Hey be glad that we didn't get the orange one.

1011
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Mine was silver.

1012
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,320
It was indigo okay.

1013
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,040
It was blue and by the way I had the black ones so.

1014
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
In Japan they had orange ones.

1015
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
That makes you extra hetero.

1016
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,040
Okay the black ones.

1017
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,400
Tigerclaw says Sky you know that old saying once you go black you never go back.

1018
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,560
Is that true Dark Soccer?

1019
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,000
Is that why you need the black Xbox 360 so bad?

1020
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,960
I want it to match my Saturn.

1021
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,960
Among other things.

1022
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,280
Here's the thing though about you're going to get this nice fancy black Xbox 360 and

1023
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:35,000
then oh wait the controllers are white, the Xbox HD DVD player is white, oh wait the remote

1024
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
is white.

1025
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Hmm that sucks.

1026
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,920
I really don't give two shits, maybe half of one but you know it's for people who say

1027
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:50,440
oh wait you know fine you've got a new one but whatever and for the record the Sega Saturn

1028
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,560
did initially come out in white in Japan.

1029
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,560
Do we really need.

1030
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,560
Check your sources.

1031
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,040
James Patrick asked in chat Dark Soccer should sell the halo one they're worth a bit of money

1032
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,040
now.

1033
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
Um the fuck I will.

1034
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,960
Yeah I know I have a halo one as well.

1035
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,960
Why would I sell it?

1036
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,680
What would I play my Xbox games on?

1037
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,960
Keep in mind if I sell my Xbox that drops me down to 42 video game systems.

1038
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,800
I have an orange one.

1039
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,800
But 42 is the answer to everything.

1040
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:23,240
Gaming Nerd says I'd love a nice pink 360 to match my pink PS2.

1041
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,200
In related news Gaming Nerd is my favorite chatter ever.

1042
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:36,040
Actually when I replace my JPS2 I'm going to get the Sakura PS2 which is sort of a purpley

1043
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,040
color.

1044
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,040
Purpley.

1045
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,920
And it's the Sakura one so it's mine.

1046
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,920
Mine.

1047
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,920
Anyways.

1048
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,640
I do I have my own brand of condoms.

1049
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,840
Speaking of partnering that a little bit.

1050
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,840
What?

1051
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,200
Well did she say that in a mic?

1052
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,880
Yes I did.

1053
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,800
Okay you know you know that okay I gotta tell you this this is totally off the subject but

1054
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,960
I gotta say okay I think over at All Games Interactive you know our buddy show our sister

1055
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,560
I think Scott likes to tease you a little bit on that show because he'll yell out random

1056
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:12,480
things like I like blueberry muffins and then he'll say he's just impersonating dark sakura

1057
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,280
and now I totally see where that comes from.

1058
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,800
I have my own brand of condoms.

1059
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,800
What?

1060
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,600
No pass the mic to Chris.

1061
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,760
Jamie and I when we hang out we go down to Japan town and we go to Ichiban-Kon.

1062
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
Ichiban-Kon.

1063
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,760
Ichiban-Kon thank you.

1064
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,800
And they've got a bunch of imports from Japan and one time we found Sakura condoms.

1065
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,920
I'm like Jamie look your condoms.

1066
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,240
And Chris said that and I repeated what she said only I had the mic in my hand.

1067
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,240
Yeah see.

1068
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,720
So that wasn't random you just weren't paying attention.

1069
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,720
I was.

1070
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
Bad host.

1071
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
Hold on.

1072
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
Bad host.

1073
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,720
Whatever.

1074
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,720
Whatever.

1075
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,720
Those are Sakura brand those are not dark sakura.

1076
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,720
It's one third your show too.

1077
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,840
But they were in a dark box.

1078
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
That does not count.

1079
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,840
Yes it does.

1080
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,560
That's just like saying okay that would be just like saying oh the Whitman chocolates

1081
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,520
out there oh they must be my brand chocolates because it's very close to my last name white

1082
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
man.

1083
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,040
You can go outside and look up.

1084
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,720
It's me Skye.

1085
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,720
You could do that.

1086
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,720
Any.

1087
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,720
Anyways.

1088
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,040
I think that also put you in the category of I invented the internet.

1089
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,640
By the way I am everywhere.

1090
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,640
Sorry Loki you had something to say.

1091
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,640
Are you finished?

1092
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,640
Are you finished?

1093
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,640
Yes we're finished.

1094
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,640
Thank you.

1095
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,640
So let's talk about partner net.

1096
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,760
Partner net's been around forever and then I guess just everybody forgot their NDA's

1097
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,280
regarding partner net because you do not talk about partner net that's first rule of partner

1098
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,280
net.

1099
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
Yeah right.

1100
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,280
Yeah right.

1101
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:43,000
Everyone I know who's ever had partner net which isn't us because we're not cool enough

1102
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
they they they blab partner net.

1103
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,480
I mean we we're we know enough that you don't post it on blogs and things but oh god.

1104
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,880
People who have partner net don't show up.

1105
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,880
Anyways so.

1106
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,880
They think they're special.

1107
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,000
So yeah it they found someone took some video of it and they found out about more pic or

1108
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,880
more games coming out.

1109
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,400
None of which I'm too surprised about.

1110
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,120
I mean some of these have already been announced.

1111
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,920
Rare's jet pack you know game that's coming out later on they've already announced that.

1112
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,200
Juice 2007 already been announced.

1113
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,360
Absolute who the hell knows what that is.

1114
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,360
Obzpinball yay.

1115
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,360
Joe Pinball.

1116
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,720
Tetris Online which I think might actually be that Tetris Evolution or whatever that's

1117
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,360
coming out in March whatever or maybe another downloadable game.

1118
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,880
Great two different Tetrises and then some Halo 2 maps that were already announced.

1119
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,960
So yeah very exciting.

1120
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,120
Great great more stuff coming out.

1121
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,100
You know like I said you can't talk about them.

1122
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,040
Although there are other websites so I've I was reading some comments that they were

1123
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,280
posting that will actually do partner net updates on their blog but I guess they're

1124
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,800
so far under the radar that no one notices that they're doing that stuff.

1125
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,280
That's great.

1126
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,440
But yeah that's a good way to get yourself in a lot of trouble with Microsoft.

1127
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,680
You know breaking NDA like that so.

1128
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:03,920
Yeah apparently one of the bigger sites that had a movie got asked to take it down.

1129
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,960
Ooh snap.

1130
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,320
Anyhow something else that came down just about as fast as it went up was the Xbox rewards

1131
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
challenge.

1132
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
Remember this?

1133
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,240
You can inflate your internet penis by increasing your gamer score by fifteen hundred points

1134
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,320
and you win I don't know crappy gamer pics in a crappy game fusion frenzy in the highest

1135
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,320
level.

1136
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,040
Well everybody tried to register it once and the site just blew up.

1137
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,440
I mean nobody could get on there nobody could register.

1138
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,200
Even now that you can get on there register the site is still kind of clunky when I got

1139
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,000
on there and finally registered it was clunky.

1140
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,560
Well Xbox's little concession for this whole thing is that they have extended the Xbox

1141
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,200
reward challenge by three days.

1142
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,000
So you have three whole more days to extend your gamer score by fifty hundred points and

1143
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,660
people are bitching and complaining because they were like dude I took the day off of

1144
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:54,440
work so I could be the first to inflate my gamer score so I could make sure that I'm

1145
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,080
one of the ones that gets this game because you only said so many copies would be out

1146
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,760
there and I'm saying if this is you my personal opinion of you is that you need to go out

1147
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,000
and get a fucking life because seriously if you took the day off of work to stay home

1148
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,720
and increase your gamer score for this competition Microsoft does not owe you anything.

1149
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,780
Microsoft made the game Microsoft made the system that is what you bought.

1150
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:22,560
This whole rewards thing is like somebody giving you something for free.

1151
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,300
Microsoft did not owe you this.

1152
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,940
Why are you so mad over that?

1153
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,920
That's why I refuse to get mad about this I mean yeah it was a little frustrating as

1154
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,800
I tried to go on the site but it's like you know what it's free stuff.

1155
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,640
Quit your bitching and get like one of those diamond cards for free and then go get discounts

1156
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,640
at other places.

1157
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,800
Or go get a whore and have sex and get some of that energy out of your system because

1158
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,280
seriously if you're getting that bent out of shape over the rewards program something's

1159
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,180
wrong like a free game.

1160
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,180
The grand prize is a free game.

1161
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,960
Fusion Frenzy 2 which by the way is like one of the lamest games out there right now.

1162
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,520
I know it's not even worth it I'm sorry.

1163
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,660
So I'm like I'm sure people know that Fusion Frenzy 2 is not even worth it so I can think

1164
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:07,100
of no other reason why people want to do this other than to say look at my giant internet

1165
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,100
cock.

1166
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:13,400
I got the free game in the Microsoft contest and let me be the first to tell you it's just

1167
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,920
like you got into the Halo 3 beta.

1168
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,800
Fucking everyone got into the Halo 3 beta.

1169
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,480
Who cares?

1170
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,100
My girlfriend's cock is bigger than yours.

1171
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,100
It is.

1172
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:30,420
You know what though if I if I went to somebody's house and they have it on display that's not

1173
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,960
unlike well I have a friend that owns a magic card shop and they show me those player cards

1174
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,740
you know with the pictures of the expert magic player it's like a guide of who not to have

1175
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,740
sex with.

1176
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:45,660
I'm sorry it is.

1177
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:53,900
I mean I think Marissa I see Marissa speaking for like the girls who are like kind of just

1178
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,100
not really associated with video games she's like from the outside oh okay well DS is cool

1179
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:03,360
and you know so she comes in and sees you know a bunch of people freaking out over video

1180
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,260
games and she goes wow I'm not fucking them.

1181
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:10,460
Well who gives a crap if they you know they don't want to have or they're not going to

1182
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,500
get you know laid by a girl.

1183
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,740
That cuts into precious time that they could be earning more gamer score points.

1184
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,540
Okay everyone I have dated has been a nerd okay this is on the record if anyone out there

1185
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:29,020
knows Kaylee and SS Kaylee and a big anime music video editor so I put in my time and

1186
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:33,020
I'm a music nerd okay that's all I have to say about that.

1187
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:39,420
She's showing her creds she's literally whipping out her she's whipping out her cock and putting

1188
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,840
it on the table.

1189
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:45,740
I spent every day at school lunch in the library okay I have I put in my nerd time.

1190
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:53,620
I have put in my time all right wow all right well anyway that's that's all I have to say

1191
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,420
on the Xbox rewards program sorry for the little rant.

1192
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,420
Well you know what that's pretty shitty however speaking of Microsoft and shitty but not in

1193
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:07,620
a shit but okay I should say Microsoft and shitty but like not shitty.

1194
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:13,180
We've been discussing Forza 2 lately the release date is in May in the United States.

1195
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:22,240
It has been confirmed that it will be released in the UK in May this year so just to give

1196
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,180
a little bit of background on that there are going to be a lot of different cars in this

1197
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:35,460
there are 15 Ferraris, 2 Maseratis, 5 Lamborghinis, 13 Porsches, pretty much a lot of good stuff

1198
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,000
there's actually I'm going to have the 1987 Porsche 959 in there so that's pretty cool.

1199
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,100
So it's looking like a pretty cool racing game if you're into that sort of thing and

1200
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:51,340
it will again have a May release in the UK as well as in the U.S. the PAL version sorry.

1201
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,860
Isn't that nice?

1202
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:59,740
That's pretty awesome and of course we're getting a lot more releases over here as well

1203
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:06,180
not just Forza 2 which is still way off but this week though we've got some good stuff

1204
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:10,580
including brand new Wii games Sonic and the Secret Rings is going to be finally heading

1205
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,800
over to us so hopefully that one won't suck as bad as I know I don't know much about this

1206
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:21,580
Sonic but will it redeem the series it looks to me honest it looks just like the older

1207
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:26,620
Sonic games so I think that this will actually be pretty decent.

1208
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:31,720
I haven't played it though so I can't say the control issues are going to still be there

1209
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:41,580
even with the Wii being brand new systems and stuff and new control sets but I hope

1210
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,980
it looks like it has some party games in it that are pretty fun so hopefully.

1211
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:50,860
Other stuff coming out though we're going to have Virtua Fighter V on the Playstation

1212
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:55,020
3 that's going to be coming out this week which is pretty awesome on the 360 the game

1213
00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:01,420
I've been playing and you've got to pick it up Crackdown as well also on the 360 there's

1214
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:07,140
going to be NBA Street Home Court that one's going to be pretty awesome on the Playstation

1215
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:14,020
2 Arena Football 2 Road to Glory if you're into that alternative type of game.

1216
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:24,980
Then of course on the PC here we've got Supreme Commander on PC.

1217
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:29,620
On the Playstation 3 download service Flow is supposed to finally make its way on the

1218
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:37,780
22nd let's see here on the DS Ozuna Legend of the Unemployed Ninja which should be pretty

1219
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:48,660
interesting and then also on PC Warfront Turning Point and also that's about it as far as the

1220
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,780
good stuff.

1221
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:56,860
Alright well moving on over to Japan where the video games come from a lot of times but

1222
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:01,020
also you know especially when it comes to Xbox 360 the U.S. kind of gets them first

1223
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,940
usually but it looks like they're doing a simultaneous release with Riot Act which is

1224
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:08,740
what they're going to call Crackdown over in Japan Riot Act is coming out this week

1225
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:13,820
over in Japan Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent also gets a release on the 22nd of February

1226

out on February 22nd coming out on the Playstation 2 you get a whole lot of stuff over in Japan

1231
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,660
what I thought was interesting though is that they're getting Destroy All Humans on the

1232
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:52,140
Playstation 2 so a game that was popular enough over here made its way over to Japan so Lupin

01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:21,680
in a steady at a steady pace instead of backing up so I have to wait 45 minutes to take my

1265
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,500
Hot Pixel was that one PSP game that's kind of like WarioWare, right?

1266
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,220
It's not coming out until August here, I think.

1267
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,220
Hey, our UK friends get games first!

1268
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,900
Wow, it's a first! Good job, UK!

1269
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,100
Yeah, but too bad the game didn't look that good.

1270
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,220
Too bad the guy's kind of crazy, he's like this old dude.

1271
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:01,180
Oh yeah, that's right, he was talking to us and he was kind of creepy.

1272
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,020
I got his card but I felt like...

1273
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:06,380
Well, he's not going to come on the show now, sorry.

1274
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:09,700
I just called him creepy. He has his own podcast, by the way.

1275
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,020
Does he? I bet it's creepy.

1276
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,360
Anyways, um...

1277
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:24,180
So, apparently in the UK, there's this wonderful show called Watchdog that they investigate companies and stuff like that

1278
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:31,420
that have either defective products or, you know, it's kind of like, I want to say there was something like this on Dateline

1279
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:35,700
or something where they investigate different businesses and make sure that they're up to par or whatever.

1280
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:42,660
So they're investigating Microsoft about the Xbox 360 because apparently they're saying that the...

1281
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:50,620
You know, they have received 248 complaints about faulty Xbox 360s and, you know,

1282
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:56,180
they're saying that the return rate was, you know, larger than Microsoft initially said

1283
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:01,580
and that the fact that the owners had to spend, or some of the owners had to spend around 80 pounds

1284
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:11,700
or about $156 to fix each of the units that just so happened to break after, you know, a year of purchasing the system.

1285
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,860
You know, at the same time, I just...

1286
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:21,140
Aren't they a little late on this? You know, I mean, wasn't this whole defective 360 story like about a year ago?

1287
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,500
I... I don't know.

1288
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,780
It takes time to build these cases, though, don't forget.

1289
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:29,260
And it is the UK and, you know, everything's delayed, unfortunately with them, so...

1290
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:36,580
Anyways, so Microsoft, of course, responded saying that the claims made by the show are, you know,

1291
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:43,860
false, that the return rate of the Xbox 360 is significantly lower than the CE industry average of 3-5%.

1292
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:48,020
Customer satisfaction is our highest priority and we do everything that we can to take care of the gamers

1293
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,980
who may have problems with their consoles.

1294
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:55,700
Anybody having an issue with their 360 should call customer service immediately so that we can help.

1295
01:04:55,700 --> 01:05:02,100
And, you know, to be honest, though, they did increase their warranty period for the 360 and...

1296
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,700
I don't know, I think they're doing their part.

1297
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,900
I mean, I would say, how are these 360s being broken?

1298
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,020
I mean, if it's people, you know...

1299
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:14,940
I still hear my customers talking about, oh, yeah, this game came back scratched because there's a ring in it now

1300
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:22,940
because, you know, someone's jiggled their 360 while it's going and it carved a big ring into their disc.

1301
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,940
So people are dumb.

1302
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:30,340
I thought the X meant I shake it.

1303
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:34,460
What? The system's not like the Wii controller? It's not motion sensitive?

1304
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,980
Actually, to be honest, the system is motion sensitive.

1305
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,900
It will know if you're laying it flat or if you're laying it upright.

1306
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,660
It's true, it's true.

1307
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:46,900
But that's a little, yeah, that's a little tiny little bubble that does that probably.

1308
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:52,220
Anyhow, speaking of watchdog agencies, the biggest watchdog of them all is the government.

1309
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:59,460
And Sam Brownback is a senator, a Republican senator, and he's also somebody who is running

1310
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:07,460
for president in 2008, at least in Kansas, and he's exploring the Republican nomination

1311
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,980
for the president of the United States.

1312
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:16,980
Well, Sam Brownback is also one of the minds behind the Video Game Rating Act, and it has been reintroduced.

1313
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:22,100
It was first introduced last September, but it is now being reintroduced for Senate.

1314
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:26,940
If this was made law, what would happen is that the ESRB, you may remember us talking about this back in September,

1315
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:32,300
the ESRB would have to play the final build of a game from the beginning to the end

1316
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,940
until they could actually give it a rating.

1317
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:39,380
Because I believe the way the ESRB works now, they're just filling out a questionnaire.

1318
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:42,340
Maybe they play a little bit of the game, but that's about it, right?

1319
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:47,020
Yeah, it's the same way the MPAA works, and I don't see anyone cracking down the MPAA.

1320
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,940
I think the movies and the games should be done the exact same way.

1321
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,460
Why not? Why not?

1322
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:57,940
I think movies, TV, and games should all be done the exact same way. Why not?

1323
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:03,740
Let me give a quick quote, and I think Marissa wants to chime in too.

1324
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:12,300
Video game reviewers should be required to review the entire content of a game to ensure the accuracy of the rating.

1325
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:18,140
The current video game rating system is not as accurate as it could be because reviewers do not see the full content of games

1326
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:22,380
and do not even play the games they rate.

1327
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,420
Boy, they're going to be screwed when they have to review Oblivion or an MMO.

1328
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,220
Anyway, Marissa?

1329
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,100
This issue in particular gets me really passionate.

1330
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:33,380
I watched a great documentary called This Movie Is Not Yet Rated the other day about the MPAA.

1331
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,420
I don't know if you've seen it.

1332
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:39,780
I've heard of it, and I really want to see it, but I've heard it's just like Super Size Me resonated with McDonald's.

1333
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,980
I heard this movie resonated with the MPAA.

1334
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:46,540
The government should not step in, but interestingly enough, I think there's a problem when the industry regulates itself

1335
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,300
because it creates a monopoly.

1336
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:53,140
I don't understand, like, for movies, for example, you can go to website kidsandmine.com,

1337
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,740
and it just lists specifically what is in the movie.

1338
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:59,780
I don't think a rating system is a good idea because then people interject their opinion into it.

1339
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:04,420
If you want to say there is sex in this, there's et cetera, and I know this is a really old Mimi,

1340
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:09,580
but it still amazed me that people got upset about the hot coffee mod in Grand Theft Auto,

1341
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:13,980
but they didn't have a problem with the fact that their five-year-old kid was killing hookers, et cetera.

1342
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:18,220
Now, I like the game myself, but why is sex the problem?

1343
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,220
Perfect example, the hot coffee thing.

1344
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:25,260
I mean, granted, it was an interactive little mini-game, whose graphics were really bad, by the way,

1345
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:29,540
but yet I don't hear anyone complaining that there's a fucking sex mini-game in the original God of War

1346
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:33,780
and in God of War II, which there's full fucking titties in the goddamn game.

1347
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:34,740
Because it wasn't hidden.

1348
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,660
This wasn't...

1349
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:36,700
Oh, it's not hidden.

1350
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,260
Big deal.

1351
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,460
It's an M-rated game.

1352
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:42,540
The difference between a 17- and 18-year-old, can you really say mindset-wise?

1353
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:45,300
I mean, granted, okay, one's a legal adult,

1354
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:49,100
but mindset-wise, one's gonna know about boobies as much as the other one.

1355
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,900
That's because they need to pull the corncob out of their ass

1356
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,700
and stop fucking promoting a double fucking standard.

1357
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,660
How would you feel if the video game was the exact same thing as the movie?

1358
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,740
You pick up the box and on the back it says,

1359
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:03,580
this game is rated R for sexuality and language.

1360
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,740
And it still says sexual content.

1361
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:06,740
Isn't that how they do it in Europe?

1362
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,140
Yeah, the UK, it's the same system.

1363
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,900
Okay, it said it was rated M for sexual content.

1364
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,300
It was on there.

1365
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,940
It didn't specify saying, oh, it's rated because of this minigame.

1366
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,500
It said sexual content.

1367
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,020
So this is really getting...

1368
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,220
Now you're starting to get into semantics here about,

1369
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:26,100
oh, well, is this sexual content that made it M-rated and not this sexual content?

1370
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:26,980
Who gives a shit?

1371
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:30,420
It's M, it says sexual content.

1372
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:31,860
Do we need to do anything else?

1373
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,460
No.

1374
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:32,900
You know what?

1375
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,140
People are stupid and there's a lot of...

1376
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,380
I mean, no, I'm not saying this about everybody

1377
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,940
because we have parents that listen to this program

1378
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:41,660
and you're probably smart because you know how to download a podcast.

1379
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,340
But there's a lot of stupid parents out there.

1380
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,140
And for their benefit, you know, I'm going to give a little here.

1381
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,660
It's about the world works with compromise, right?

1382
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:53,220
My compromise is, okay, we will make one rating system.

1383
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:56,780
So you don't have to think like, okay, I'm not that smart, so I have to translate.

1384
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,220
And M means like an NC-17, okay?

1385
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,540
Let's use one rating system across the board.

1386
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,860
That's my compromise.

1387
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,860
That way you stupid people don't have to memorize more than one system.

1388
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:09,020
I'm pretty sure that's how we do it in Europe, isn't it?

1389
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,260
And that makes perfect sense.

1390
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:16,620
You know, as actually, it's funny, sort of related to that,

1391
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:20,900
our good friend Rob with two Bs, I wasn't going to cover this in the mailbag,

1392
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:26,900
but he sent me an article about parents were suing MySpace

1393
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:31,420
for their daughter lying about being 18.

1394
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:34,300
My sister says she's 19.

1395
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,940
I'm not finished.

1396
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,780
And their daughter going to meet up with this guy and then getting the hot nookie on.

1397
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,820
And the parent was sued.

1398
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:45,740
Well, as the article states, the judge was like, fuck you.

1399
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,340
It was your job to police her.

1400
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,740
That is the wrong person to be suing.

1401
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,860
They need to sue the internet.

1402
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,580
Internet is the blame.

1403
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,900
Sue Al Gore for an event again.

1404
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,740
Just to go ahead just a little bit into it.

1405
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:59,180
It was a 12-year-old Texas girl lied about being 18,

1406
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:02,940
met a 19-year-old man for dinner and a movie, and had some hot nookie.

1407
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:06,620
And then the parents tried to sue MySpace for $30 million,

1408
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:08,100
accusing the site of negligence.

1409
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,140
But the judge in the case, Judge Sam Sparks, turned around.

1410
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,940
And I quote, if anyone had a duty to protect Julie Doe,

1411
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,780
it was her parents, not MySpace.

1412
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:21,020
All right, and what's in Judge Sam Sparks?

1413
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,340
Judge Sam Sparks is our American Citizen of the Week.

1414
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:24,840
Yay.

1415
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,260
Our hats off to you for telling this parent to go fuck herself.

1416
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,980
The reason why I think it was worth noting

1417
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:42,220
is that, and actually, our RobOTV's also mentioned it,

1418
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:45,820
that this might actually set a precedence now

1419
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:49,140
for future cases involving parental negligence.

1420
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:49,740
I'm sorry.

1421
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,500
I just get really passionate on this issue

1422
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,900
for being exceptionally yappy.

1423
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,980
But I mean, I agree with the idea of a rating system

1424
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:58,020
because it is unfair that children feel a lot of pressure

1425
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,100
nowadays to be hip and cool, et cetera,

1426
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,820
and they want the same things we do,

1427
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,220
which is a completely different rant of mine.

1428
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,060
Sex?

1429
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,140
Sex is cool, too.

1430
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,020
But it's a completely different rant of mine

1431
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:10,540
that we need to allow children to still be children and not

1432
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,300
little adults.

1433
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,900
But anyway, the only beef with the rating system

1434
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,900
is, though, is that the GPG, et cetera, that, again,

1435
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,020
is a personal opinion.

1436
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,420
And actually, though, I think it makes it easier for parents,

1437
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:25,060
for those who approve of more sexual content

1438
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:27,660
because their own opinion or approve of less violence

1439
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,340
or more violence, et cetera, you just

1440
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,460
say explicitly what is in the game that

1441
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,220
is different than saying, well, I believe

1442
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:35,760
that this is because there's 12 different kinds of rated R

1443
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,260
movies.

1444
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,940
So there could be 12 different kinds of rated R games.

1445
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,620
I know you look at a movie like Romeo and Michelle's

1446
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,580
High School Reunion, that movie is rated R,

1447
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,340
yet it's probably one of the most harmless movies

1448
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:44,980
I've ever seen.

1449
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:48,100
Like, it gets rated R because Janine Garofalo says fuck

1450
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,180
like three times.

1451
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,980
And then you look at a movie like Sin City

1452
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,620
that's rated R, where like, you know,

1453
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,060
fucking bullets through heads, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck

1454
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,140
every other minute, titties everywhere.

1455
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,380
You know, there's a big, big difference.

1456
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,860
Well, here's the other thing, too.

1457
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:02,580
And I hate how they always say, oh, we

1458
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,860
need to put more responsibility on the ESRB

1459
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:06,860
and rating these games.

1460
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,460
No, you have to put more responsibility

1461
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,740
on these parents who just ignore the ratings.

1462
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:13,020
And they say, oh, I didn't know this content was in here.

1463
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,460
Yeah, you didn't know because you didn't read.

1464
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,380
And then you bought it for your five-year-old

1465
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,700
because you'll do anything for your five-year-old

1466
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,620
and you won't even question it.

1467
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,940
You'll just like, OK, I'm going to buy him a fucking porno

1468
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:24,440
then.

1469
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,540
I mean, seriously, if that's going

1470
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:31,220
to be such an issue with you, it's just I don't understand.

1471
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,700
And I don't understand how, OK, granted the content

1472
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,620
was hidden in the game.

1473
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,580
OK, yippee, it's hidden in the game.

1474
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:40,420
So if I created, say, a series of GameShark codes

1475
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:44,780
or something like that and made a topless mod for Tomb Raider,

1476
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:49,980
a very elaborate process I might add that would probably be,

1477
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,820
then we get to sue IOS over that.

1478
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,620
I mean, this is stuff that was created by someone else.

1479
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,660
It wasn't even in the final version of the game.

1480
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:00,020
And basically, you've pointed out

1481
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,460
that this content is in there for parents that didn't know.

1482
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,620
And even the parents that are suing about this

1483
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,740
didn't know how to access the content in the game

1484
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,820
or wasn't even aware.

1485
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,940
Can I say this real quick?

1486
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:10,980
I want to keep it moving.

1487
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,560
But I got to say, I blame the media to some extent, too.

1488
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:17,020
Because I bet if half the parents saw what the Tomb Raider

1489
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:20,980
mod looks like or actually saw the mini game, they would go,

1490
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:23,300
that's so stupid.

1491
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,540
But parents listen to what the media says.

1492
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:29,660
And the media says, did you know your child can do real fucking

1493
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:32,260
in Grand Theft Auto, like power-fucking

1494
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,900
with the X button, coming to Grand Theft Auto tonight

1495
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,020
on Xdrop?

1496
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,800
You know, and I think parents go off of what they hear

1497
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,940
and not what they're actually seeing.

1498
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,300
There's so much of that sensationalism that I think

1499
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,900
takes everything to the nth degree.

1500
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:47,260
I don't actually agree with that.

1501
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,920
I'm just going to say this really quick.

1502
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:52,500
Because do you remember how big that Super Bowl thing

1503
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,500
with Janet Jackson was?

1504
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:58,660
Her titty was on television for a half a second.

1505
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,420
But it was covered.

1506
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:01,300
It was covered.

1507
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,740
It went and fucking freaked out, though.

1508
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:08,180
It was covered with a stupid nipple shield.

1509
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,700
I saw the exact same thing on Fucking Girls

1510
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,860
Next Door, where she had a stupid sticker over her nipple.

1511
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,340
And then that was acceptable.

1512
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,260
It wasn't a sticker.

1513
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,380
It was actually a piercing.

1514
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,500
Dude, my grandma came out once and didn't

1515
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,740
realize I was in the room.

1516
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:21,860
And I didn't sue her.

1517
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,260
Movies kill.

1518
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,660
Movies kill.

1519
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,060
It might have made me gay, but I didn't sue her.

1520
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,180
I'm just kidding.

1521
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:32,180
That's not what made me gay.

1522
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:34,300
I firmly believe it's a biological thing.

1523
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:38,620
Anyway, yeah, cock made me gay.

1524
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:41,740
All right, anyhow.

1525
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,700
Rheoma in chat says, Sky, never talk about that again.

1526
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:45,740
But I'm serious.

1527
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,920
I mean, what kid didn't accidentally

1528
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:53,660
see a titty at some point, or a dick?

1529
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,180
Duke Nukem had boobies in it, too.

1530
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:59,220
Yeah, pixelated 8-bit boobies.

1531
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,660
I mean, that's what they look like.

1532
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,900
That's hot.

1533
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,140
All right.

1534
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,500
Anyhow, moving on.

1535
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,460
Every week, we invite you to give your feedback here

1536
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,980
on our program through our mailbag, among other things.

1537
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,700
We like to be an interactive program.

1538
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,300
Because it's not just about us.

1539
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,260
It's not just about the three of us that run this program.

1540
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:23,020
It's not just about Marissa or Chris or any of the other folks

1541
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:23,620
you've heard.

1542
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,200
Chris thinks it's all about her, but it's actually not.

1543
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,140
We invite you guys to interact with us by the chat room,

1544
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:32,740
by the voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

1545
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,660
or through the email bag, which you can email us every week

1546
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,460
at mailbag at orangeontraday.com.

1547
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,060
We love getting your emails.

1548
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,860
And DarkSakura, she's the queen of the mailbag.

1549
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:44,180
She likes to jump in there and pull out

1550
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,380
some of her favorite emails.

1551
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,140
She's going to do that right now.

1552
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,220
I'm going to pull it out.

1553
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:56,060
I'm going to pull it out.

1554
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,580
You should have said that on mic.

1555
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,540
And GS68 says, and you penetrate her weak point

1556
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,620
for massive damage.

1557
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,020
Mailbag, please.

1558
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,620
General alien crab bag.

1559
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,580
I mean, wait.

1560
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:09,820
Sorry.

1561
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:10,780
Only.

1562
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:14,660
WTB, mail.

1563
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,460
Rob.

1564
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,100
What?

1565
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,620
Whatever.

1566
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,260
Four emails.

1567
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:25,900
The first one from, I'm not sure exactly what to say,

1568
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:26,700
the nickname ask.

1569
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,300
Can we try something new tonight?

1570
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,420
When you say that we're going to do the first email,

1571
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:33,140
what I'd like Chris to do is to say very sexily,

1572
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:34,900
letter number one.

1573
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,940
All right, so here we go.

1574
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,460
So can we start from the top, please?

1575
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,420
All right, here we go.

1576
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:42,940
Say the first email.

1577
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,340
OK, Chris.

1578
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,020
Letter number one.

1579
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:47,420
All right, very good.

1580
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,740
Dear Rob, DarkSakura, and Loki, I just

1581
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,540
wanted to say hello to you all and tell you

1582
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:52,780
how much I enjoy your program.

1583
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:54,940
I've been listening for a little over a year now.

1584
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,740
I actually first found out about you guys

1585
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:59,740
when looking for websites that were optimized to view on my PSP.

1586
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:02,260
Hint, hint, hint, hint.

1587
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,940
OLRPSP.com.

1588
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,540
Anyway, what's the deal with Rice Princess?

1589
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,060
She has a filthy, filthy mouth and is incredibly offensive.

1590
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,820
You should have her on the show more often.

1591
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,900
Keep up the good work.

1592
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,060
Is Rice Princess still here?

1593
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,980
Let me go find Rice Princess.

1594
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:17,020
Talk smack about Rice Princess quick before I get her in here.

1595
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:20,740
Oh my god, Irene is so, no.

1596
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:24,500
I'm going to skip the, I'm going to go on to the next email.

1597
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,100
Email number two.

1598
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,780
You sounded like you had to go to the bathroom.

1599
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,140
Oh, wait a minute.

1600
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,500
We just read one of your fan letters on the program.

1601
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,180
Oh, god, who won?

1602
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,340
Is it true that you have an offensive, filthy mouth?

1603
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,060
Fuck yeah.

1604
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,820
Do you know any dirty jokes you can tell our listeners this week

1605
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:44,500
because our emailer said they liked having you on the show

1606
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,060
because you had a very offensive mouth.

1607
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,180
So we just wanted you to say something offensive.

1608
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:50,700
OK, poop.

1609
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,700
That's pretty offensive.

1610
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,020
That was on an offensive scale of 1 to 10.

1611
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:54,940
That was like a 3.

1612
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:58,820
OK, how about you lick the crusty poop out of my butt

1613
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,900
and then you lick the crusty poop off my finger.

1614
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,340
OK, I'm going to go.

1615
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,180
OK, that was a 9.

1616
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:03,700
That was a 9.

1617
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,380
That was much better.

1618
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,620
All right, thank you, Rice Princess.

1619
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,940
Thank you for your contributions.

1620
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:07,660
Do you want me to read it?

1621
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,780
It's a good thing we haven't done any more your mama jokes.

1622
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,300
All right.

1623
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:10,820
Me too.

1624
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,060
Do you want me to do it again?

1625
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:12,940
Yeah, you already did.

1626
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:14,740
OK.

1627
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:17,100
OK, I already did the email.

1628
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:23,020
This one is email number 2 from SpeedyF40.

1629
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,700
A year and a half ago, I tuned into OLR for the first time

1630
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,380
after finding it on Podcast Alley.

1631
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:31,340
I was not hooked, but like a festering rash, the good kind.

1632
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,740
Your show grew on me, and a year and a half later,

1633
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,340
I am still here.

1634
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,380
I have tuned into every show since that.

1635
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,020
Orange Lounge Radio.

1636
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:41,700
We're like the good kind of festering rash.

1637
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,980
That's a really good compliment.

1638
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,740
Rob, you guys are like the festering rash.

1639
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:51,260
We're the festering rash of my love.

1640
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:55,380
Could somebody who has not written a review on iTunes yet,

1641
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,380
somebody in chat volunteered to do this?

1642
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:00,220
OK, I want somebody in chat to yell out, claim this.

1643
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,100
Go to iTunes and give us a five star review, which actually

1644
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,700
everyone should do, hint, hint.

1645
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,720
But I don't want everybody saying

1646
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,080
the show is a festering rash.

1647
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,300
So I want one person from chat to nominate themselves

1648
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,460
to go write a five star review on iTunes and put,

1649
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:16,140
this show is the festering rash of gaming podcasts.

1650
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:16,860
The good kind.

1651
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:17,580
The good kind.

1652
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:21,740
Genital herpes is forever, and so is my love for Orange Lounge.

1653
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:23,900
And that, OK, somebody can lay claim to that one too.

1654
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,620
I like that one.

1655
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,020
Can I finish reading this now?

1656
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,260
Yes, you may.

1657
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:27,780
OK.

1658
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,100
Fester, Jamie, fester.

1659
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,300
Bite my butt, but not really.

1660
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,860
And you have even used one of my calls on air.

1661
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:35,420
I love independent radio, and I feel

1662
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,060
that your show is doing a service to the gamer community.

1663
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:41,100
OLR has even inspired me to do my own show.

1664
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:45,540
Loki, you suck because you don't like Max.

1665
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,940
No, that's really not what he said.

1666
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:51,660
OK.

1667
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,380
He didn't say that.

1668
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,460
I know some people may see you as an ass.

1669
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,940
You are, just not all the time.

1670
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,460
Most of the time I see you as an honest down to earth realist.

1671
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,980
Loki, you set this story straight,

1672
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,980
and your ties with the inside of the gaming world

1673
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:08,260
give the show a sense of added credibility.

1674
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:12,860
By the way, Apples do suck for gaming by a PC.

1675
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,260
I would say in two to four years,

1676
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,300
Apple computers will be a formidable gaming

1677
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,020
computer for the average person.

1678
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:19,540
Real gamers will stick with the PC,

1679
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,380
but that is a whole other thing.

1680
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,820
Jamie, your alternative views on gaming and the gaming culture

1681
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:26,580
broaden my mind and keep ideas flowing through my head.

1682
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,460
I love how you speak your mind, even though I

1683
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,420
know we will have some political differences.

1684
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,940
I hold your opinions on issues that

1685
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:33,700
affect gamers in extremely high regards.

1686
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,700
Well, thank you.

1687
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,660
That makes me feel warm in a special place.

1688
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,700
My ex-boyfriend actually had a good quote on that.

1689
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:43,420
He said, Macintosh makes the best computer out there.

1690
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:45,580
You know what the problem is?

1691
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:48,660
Nobody cares.

1692
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:50,620
Do you have another email, actually?

1693
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:51,420
There's more.

1694
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,060
OK, I want to do the sexy announcement,

1695
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:54,900
because on the internet, I'm kind

1696
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,140
of geek famous for being the voice of a character on LJ

1697
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:59,020
Drama.

1698
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:00,020
OK.

1699
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,900
All right, well, the third one is to Rob.

1700
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:02,500
Oh, yay.

1701
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,500
You got a lot of balls being a gay gamer on the internet.

1702
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,260
Pun intended.

1703
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:11,300
When I jumped on air for my own show,

1704
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:17,220
I would have to say that I model some of my on-air presence

1705
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,180
from yours.

1706
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:21,500
With me being straight guy, I come off

1707
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,820
as being very enthusiastic.

1708
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:27,460
I just don't get messages telling me I talk too much yet.

1709
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:30,140
I love O-L-R. It is polished, and it is brilliant.

1710
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,500
From your unconventional views on gaming and gaming culture

1711
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:35,020
to the straight up format of the show, I love it.

1712
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,660
I would not be who I am today on the internet and in real life

1713
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:38,780
if it was not for you guys.

1714
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,040
Independent radio for the win.

1715
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:40,780
Speedy F40.

1716
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,780
P.S. Tell Rice Princess I have a crush on her

1717
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:44,680
because she sounds like a freak.

1718
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,180
Wow.

1719
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,100
Hey, Irene.

1720
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,580
You have a fan.

1721
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,300
That's very, oh, wait.

1722
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,340
Didn't he say he ran his own podcast?

1723
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:53,220
What is it?

1724
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:53,940
Didn't say.

1725
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:55,300
Is this his Speedy F40?

1726
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,980
Is there like a signature or something?

1727
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,780
He has a crush on you because you're a freak.

1728
01:22:58,780 --> 01:22:59,380
That's what he said.

1729
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,260
Is you're a freak.

1730
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,500
Speedy F40.

1731
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,000
Oh, hi.

1732
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,500
Dude, if you're listening, and we're

1733
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,620
pretty sure that you are because you're amazing,

1734
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:08,380
send us a link to your podcast, and we'll plug you.

1735
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,100
Totally.

1736
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,340
We want to pimp that podcast.

1737
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:12,900
We will totally plug you in the most awesome way.

1738
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,100
Seriously, not to spend too much time talking about ourselves.

1739
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,180
Because I don't want to be like that.

1740
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:21,460
But that's truly one of the best compliments we could ever get.

1741
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,460
Oh, wait, it's on here.

1742
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:23,140
Oh, wait, is it?

1743
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:23,980
Oh, great.

1744
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:28,420
WCradio.com, 5 PM Eastern time on Saturday.

1745
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,300
Oh, it's part of the WC Radio, Warcraft Radio,

1746
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,540
like a huge radio thing.

1747
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,420
Really, it's Warcraft?

1748
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:34,180
Yeah, isn't it?

1749
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:34,820
Warcraft Radio.

1750
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:39,540
Or maybe this is just a, I'm not sure if this is his or not,

1751
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,740
but it's in the signature.

1752
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:43,580
So check it out, maybe?

1753
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:47,220
Well, hey, if you were going to spend all day playing

1754
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:49,180
World of Warcraft, I know the soundtrack gets old,

1755
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:51,380
so you might as well listen to Warcraft Radio, right?

1756
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,340
So go for it.

1757
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:53,940
That's very cool.

1758
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,980
And that's truly one of the best compliments.

1759
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,180
But can I say something about the gay issue

1760
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,620
without turning the show too gay as it is already?

1761
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,060
It's already gay.

1762
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:04,820
It's actually not really been a big deal

1763
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:06,180
for me to be gay on this program.

1764
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:09,060
Because I give a lot of props to the gaming community.

1765
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,540
And I think the youth in general is that I really

1766
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,100
don't think people seem to care.

1767
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,180
And I think if they do care, they're not listening.

1768
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:17,940
So hey, all for the best.

1769
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,940
This probably isn't their type of show anyway.

1770
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:21,540
If it was something they care about,

1771
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:23,780
they'd probably want to listen to bigot Radio.

1772
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:26,620
But most people that have listened to this program

1773
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,420
really don't care.

1774
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:29,660
I think that speaks volumes about the gaming community

1775
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:32,740
is that, hey, there's nothing wrong with being gay.

1776
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:35,740
But I don't want this to be the gay show either,

1777
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,260
because that's not all I am.

1778
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,580
And I think people get that wrong impression about me

1779
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,100
sometimes is that I'm the gay gamer,

1780
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,540
and that's all I can think about is how much cock is in my games.

1781
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,580
At least you're not the titty queen.

1782
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,140
Yeah, we plug the lesbian thing on me just because it's funny.

1783
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:54,340
It's for the straight men.

1784
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,900
This segment is getting entirely too gay.

1785
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:57,580
All right, sorry.

1786
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:58,260
I just want to sit.

1787
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,820
Talk about your joystick some more.

1788
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:00,940
Wait, wait, sexy, please.

1789
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:02,460
Except that boobs are hot.

1790
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,660
Oh, I was just going to say, it's not all gay radio

1791
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,500
unless you talk about your joystick too much.

1792
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,100
Rawr.

1793
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,860
Oh, oh.

1794
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,740
Hi, it's me, Victoria.

1795
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,860
Email number three.

1796
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,700
Dude, that was hot.

1797
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:17,660
That was hot.

1798
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,540
I got a semi.

1799
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:23,660
Hey, OLR, I started World of Warcraft for the New Year.

1800
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,780
I fell in love with WoW until I installed the Burning Crusade

1801
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:27,780
expansion pack.

1802
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,900
Oh my god, oh my god.

1803
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,940
No, I would not interrupt you if this is not the best thing ever.

1804
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:32,980
You interrupt me all the time.

1805
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,860
No, I would not do this if this is not the best thing ever,

1806
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:35,360
DarkSaga.

1807
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:35,860
Trust me.

1808
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:38,580
DJ Jenai says, maybe we should rename the show

1809
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,660
to the games and you show.

1810
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,220
G-A-Y, games and you.

1811
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,460
I don't understand, but it went and started up.

1812
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,420
So I reinstalled it like two times,

1813
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,740
and eventually I just called Blizzard.

1814
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,360
They told me that my graphics card just

1815
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,980
happened to not be compatible with World of Warcraft.

1816
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:59,140
He told me, luckily, I was able to play for a while,

1817
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:00,820
but once I installed the expansion pack,

1818
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:01,980
it stopped working.

1819
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:06,500
I have a VIA S3G Unicrome Pro ITG graphics card.

1820
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,620
So just don't want anyone who plays World of Warcraft

1821
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:09,380
or is starting.

1822
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:13,140
Just make sure that you should upgrade to a new graphics card

1823
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:18,140
if you have the VIA S3G Unicrome Pro ITG graphics card.

1824
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,820
So he has, like, an in the groove graphics card.

1825
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:21,320
What?

1826
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,020
Look.

1827
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,820
He's got an in the groove graphics card.

1828
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:26,220
Oh, IGT?

1829
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,460
No, that shoots a hole in my joke.

1830
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,860
PS, my cousin bought Burning Crusade for my birthday,

1831
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:32,780
and now I can't play World of Warcraft at all.

1832
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:34,300
Nice birthday present, isn't it?

1833
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,420
Aw, don't cry, emo kid.

1834
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,660
Tough advice from Chris.

1835
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,780
I reinstalled it, and it was a pain in the ass.

1836
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:45,820
But I've got a Mac, so I don't need to upgrade anything.

1837
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:47,580
Next.

1838
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,900
Wait, what number?

1839
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,380
Shut up, Rosa.

1840
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,620
This is from Let's Have Tea.

1841
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:53,940
Email what?

1842
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:55,020
Number four.

1843
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,900
Email number four.

1844
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,700
Hey there.

1845
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:00,260
I don't know.

1846
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:02,420
I think my semi went away, because she sounded 17.

1847
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:05,260
Fuck you.

1848
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:08,380
Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.

1849
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,860
Hey there, OLR, Let's Have Tea here.

1850
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,060
I have been a longtime listener, even though I have only

1851
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:15,100
actually tuned into the live show a few times,

1852
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,020
podcast for the win.

1853
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,760
That's not what this email is about, though.

1854
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,180
A few weeks back, you were talking

1855
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:21,640
about the Wii being used as a fitness weight loss tool.

1856
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,900
I was digging through Dig, ha, and came across a few

1857
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,860
interesting articles.

1858
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,900
One article was showing how somebody lost nine pounds

1859
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,620
playing Wii Sports for 30 minutes a day for six weeks.

1860
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,460
He didn't change his normal eating habits at all.

1861
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:33,940
He just played the game more.

1862
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:36,220
And that's because it's exercise.

1863
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:39,980
Also, it's activity for 30 minutes.

1864
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,660
It will raise the heart rate.

1865
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:45,460
I burn weight doing massage three days a week for 30

1866
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,460
minutes, so yeah.

1867
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:50,020
You do any kind of exercise for 30 minutes a day, it's

1868
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:50,620
going to do something.

1869
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:53,100
If you don't eat McDonald's during that same length of

1870
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,820
time, you'll lose twice as much.

1871
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:56,780
Yeah, exactly.

1872
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:59,260
Also, I saw another article about wrist weight with the

1873
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:00,740
Wii logo on them.

1874
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:04,460
Sure, they were fan-created concept products, but there

1875
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,140
are similar products out there for similar workout

1876
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:07,260
activities.

1877
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:09,300
Would any of you consider using one of these wrist

1878
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,980
weights while playing an actual workout tool?

1879
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,220
I considered getting a pair of generic ones to make it

1880
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:16,900
harder to play Wii tennis and actually give my friends a

1881
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,060
chance at beating me.

1882
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,580
What do you think of the whole Wii fitness idea?

1883
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:24,980
Just to let you know, and this is just because of my recent

1884
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:28,380
involvement in the health industry, I am not prescribing

1885
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,420
nor recommending anything.

1886
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:33,580
This is not a prescription, just to protect my ass.

1887
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:38,460
You do run a risk of damaging your wrists using a wrist

1888
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,580
weight with anything that you have to flick or

1889
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:43,060
move your wrist with.

1890
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:45,940
Wrist weights are actually not all that safe to use.

1891
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:46,420
Exactly.

1892
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:51,260
No one wants to break their masturbating wrist.

1893
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:59,460
My problem is I would not want to put more effort into it.

1894
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:04,380
I say stand up and do it, because you burn more

1895
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,620
calories standing up.

1896
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:13,020
My problem is that I would not want to wear the wrist

1897
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,220
weights, because I would be afraid that my wrist would

1898
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:17,940
hang down more than it already does.

1899
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,020
Then you'd look uber gay.

1900
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,500
There's a visual there.

1901
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:26,660
You know, uh, radio visual joke.

1902
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:29,060
Here, I got some advice.

1903
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:32,500
Get up and go to the fucking gym.

1904
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:35,900
I have no patience for people who sit there and say, you get

1905
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:37,660
a great workout playing the video game.

1906
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,620
No, you don't.

1907
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:40,700
Actually, yeah, you do if you play DDR.

1908
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:43,220
That's not the same thing, though.

1909
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:44,140
Actually, not.

1910
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:44,700
OK.

1911
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,540
I can give you DDR.

1912
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:48,820
I did get up and play.

1913
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:51,540
It's a difference if you actually get up and move your

1914
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,940
arm as opposed to sitting on the couch

1915
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:55,220
and flicking your wrist.

1916
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:58,180
If you get up and get into the game, you actually are

1917
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:59,340
elevating your heart rate.

1918
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,620
You are actually burning more than you are sitting down and

1919
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,140
flicking your wrist.

1920
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:05,260
Yeah, but you need to also stop eating junk food.

1921
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:07,260
And you need to go outside in the sunshine.

1922
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,180
And you need to check yourself into a gym so

1923
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:11,300
you don't turn fat.

1924
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,180
I see it as like steps.

1925
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:16,100
Like if you want to do a little bit that's better than

1926
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:17,340
nothing, you do the Wii.

1927
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,900
If you want to go all the way in, you do the gym.

1928
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,460
It's kind of like different levels.

1929
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:25,860
I think that Wii Sports is a great springboard into

1930
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,900
building up activity levels, especially if you've been

1931
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,980
living a sedentary lifestyle.

1932
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:33,660
If you're going from Uber, couch, internet, potato, to

1933
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:37,220
moving, playing the game, first of all, that's actually

1934
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:39,220
building up your energy, building up your endurance,

1935
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:40,660
even if it's minute.

1936
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:44,140
That is a good step into the next level of exercise.

1937
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:48,060
See, unlike a lot of my friends since I live in LA, I

1938
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:50,500
like to indulge in this activity on occasion.

1939
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,820
It's called eating.

1940
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:57,660
And actually, I'm actually completely pro on the idea of

1941
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,340
working out with this.

1942
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:00,420
Because quite frankly, it's not.

1943
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,460
I mean, I completely agree with Chris.

1944
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,660
It's good to get out of the house, et cetera.

1945
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,660
No, I'm in complete agreement on that.

1946
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:06,340
I agree with that, too.

1947
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:08,940
But sometimes going to the gym sucks.

1948
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:11,620
Let's face it, people go there to meet other people.

1949
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:13,260
People are checking each other out.

1950
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,100
And when I go in there and my fat ass, I am not interested

1951
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:17,340
in that, I do want to get a workout.

1952
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:19,660
And if I can do it at home and not be bored out of my brain

1953
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,740
because the StairMaster goes nowhere, I feel like a

1954
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:23,540
hamster wheel.

1955
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:25,660
I feel like I'm on the hamster wheel of life.

1956
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:27,140
That if you get to do a lot of playing games, great.

1957
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:30,060
You pay $50 and you go up.

1958
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,380
Dennis Leary for the win.

1959
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:32,900
Yes, Dennis Leary.

1960
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:33,740
Life sucks.

1961
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,300
Get a helmet.

1962
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:37,740
Yay, I'm sorry.

1963
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:42,140
Another thing, though, is you know, and this is what I'm

1964
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:44,140
going to do for my, because I used to be an utter gym

1965
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:47,220
junkie before I developed chronic fatigue syndrome

1966
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:49,500
because I was going to the gym five days a week.

1967
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:52,540
I dropped something like 85 pounds in two and a half

1968
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,460
years, which I hate you for.

1969
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:59,820
Jamie used to have a few extra pounds, but she's lost it all.

1970
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:01,020
She's hot.

1971
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:05,460
I don't care saying I went from a size 22 to a size 12 in

1972
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:07,060
two and a half years.

1973
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:15,140
So I think, you know, going to the gym was good for me

1974
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:17,300
because I actually like to lift weights because I like

1975
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,700
being stronger.

1976
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,260
But cardio is fucking boring.

1977
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:23,900
So I'm actually, now that I have the OK to go back to the

1978
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,860
gym, I'm actually going to be taking, OK, I've been slightly

1979
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:29,260
obsessed with Dancing with the Stars lately after watching

1980
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:30,900
Stacey Keebler's Legs.

1981
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,540
So I'm going to actually take ballroom dancing.

1982
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:33,900
You know what they should have?

1983
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,580
They should have wee yoga.

1984
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,620
Wee yoga would be amazing.

1985
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:41,100
They kind of have something like that on Xbox.

1986
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,100
And I think there was a version on GameCube.

1987
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,060
I know there was on PS2.

1988
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,300
It was that Think Fitness game or whatever.

1989
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:49,540
I think it had yoga in it.

1990
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:53,700
So that, you know, and I want the entire tardy listeners to

1991
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:57,620
know that when I say, yeah, you can fucking go to the gym,

1992
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:00,020
this is from experience, OK?

1993
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:01,740
You can get off your ass and do it.

1994
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:02,900
You just have to want it bad enough.

1995
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:06,020
Nothing changes until you want it bad

1996
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:07,580
enough to make it change.

1997
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:08,220
Thank you, Jamie.

1998
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:11,420
But would it be fair to say there's also alternatives?

1999
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:13,340
Because we have a lot of folks in the chat saying gyms are

2000
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:15,980
expensive or folks don't like the gym environment.

2001
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:18,540
Like JB Monn says, gyms in the village in NYC are just big

2002
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:20,260
bath houses with exercise equipment.

2003
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,020
It's called going outside and walking.

2004
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,060
There's alternatives.

2005
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:26,940
And maybe go outside, run, go outside, walk, find a walking

2006
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:29,740
buddy, do something to make yourself more fit.

2007
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:32,660
But wouldn't this be at least a little baby step in the

2008
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:33,540
right direction?

2009
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:34,900
Yeah, I granted that.

2010
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:35,940
I granted that.

2011
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:38,220
I just, it's just people annoy me.

2012
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,540
And for Ryoma, a special message for you.

2013
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,780
Fuck your Yankee blue jeans.

2014
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:46,140
Yay.

2015
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:48,500
Anyway, there's more to that email.

2016
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:48,980
There's more to that email.

2017
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:49,460
Oh, more?

2018
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:50,460
OK, wow.

2019
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:51,380
A little bit.

2020
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:53,340
We were at the end.

2021
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,500
Again, I love the show.

2022
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,580
And thank you so much for the many hours of entertainment

2023
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:58,380
and news you have provided everyone.

2024
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:01,140
I'm a quote, truck driver, pickup truck, ha ha.

2025
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:03,500
And have to drive a little over an hour straight every

2026
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,460
Saturday and Sunday.

2027
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:06,700
So your podcast really helps pass the time.

2028
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,620
Thanks again, and best wishes.

2029
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:12,140
And it also says, let's have T rates as low as 4.65%.

2030
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:17,140
Refinance $150,000 loan for $579 a month.

2031
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,500
Amazing.

2032
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,660
And you want to know what's funny?

2033
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:25,380
Since I work in the mortgage industry, that actually isn't

2034
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:27,740
really all that great in you unless you have an

2035
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:29,020
interest-only loan.

2036
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:30,940
Isn't that some ad that goes on the bottom of the email

2037
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:32,300
automatically?

2038
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,420
I think it's hilarious.

2039
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:35,580
I work in the mortgage industry, so whenever I see

2040
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,700
those things, I go, oh, that's shitty.

2041
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:40,060
Because I know how to read loan documents.

2042
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:41,300
It actually is another language.

2043
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,740
Too bad this isn't a banking show.

2044
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:47,460
Yeah, but I have tomorrow off, so suck it.

2045
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:48,540
No, you suck it.

2046
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:50,140
I have to work tomorrow.

2047
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:51,620
Suck it twice, ha.

2048
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:53,100
Suck it infinity.

2049
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,660
Oh, yeah?

2050
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:55,340
Oh, yes.

2051
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:59,780
Well, you can eat a hairy clam.

2052
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:02,420
Did she tell me to eat a hairy clit on?

2053
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,020
Is that what?

2054
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:06,340
She said a hairy clam.

2055
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,580
Polish my pearl, Rob.

2056
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:09,580
Fucking gross.

2057
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:16,260
This show just got rated AO.

2058
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:17,980
I can't believe.

2059
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:20,180
I think in like, what is this?

2060
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:20,860
Episode 220?

2061
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:23,140
In 220 episodes of Orange House Radio, that was a

2062
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:26,820
phallus thing that bitch has ever said to me.

2063
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:29,580
I had the top Irene's crusty shit.

2064
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:30,180
Oh, OK.

2065
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,220
No, no, Rob.

2066
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:33,620
Remember, you are a douchebag.

2067
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:36,940
Yes, Rob, is the official douchebag of Orange House.

2068
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:40,900
Why are you bringing up like five-year-old drama of a guy

2069
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:42,580
that drives me nuts?

2070
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:44,340
There's this guy who drives me.

2071
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:46,060
Oh, it's like Neil's on a chalkboard.

2072
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:47,820
No, no, no, I'm not going to say it, because I know I'm not

2073
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:48,900
going to give attention.

2074
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,220
I will say it.

2075
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:53,860
He works for a major gaming blog now, and I'm just like,

2076
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:56,620
oh, this guy's annoying.

2077
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:59,060
Yeah, he called me a douchebag once at a DDR tournament, and

2078
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:01,260
in my response, I was like, because Irene was with me, I

2079
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,900
was like, oh my god, Irene, I'm vinegar and water.

2080
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:06,820
Did you hear that?

2081
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:07,940
You're clean.

2082
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:09,620
Yes, at least I'm clean.

2083
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:10,940
Cut your hair.

2084
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:13,220
All right, anyway, that's it.

2085
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,620
I don't want to get into drama, because I

2086
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:16,540
really don't care.

2087
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,740
I'm at least years old.

2088
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:19,180
I don't even know why this person didn't

2089
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:20,980
like me, to be honest.

2090
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:22,260
Because he's fabulous.

2091
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,140
I mean, I know why I don't like him, because

2092
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:24,900
he didn't like me.

2093
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,420
It's like, you started it.

2094
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:28,940
He has an electrocuted corncob, but yes, it has this.

2095
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:32,260
But just so tight that any time they pull it out, it bleeds.

2096
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,220
All right, anyhow, can we please change the subject?

2097
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:35,140
I don't want to talk about it.

2098
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:36,460
I was just trying to talk about it.

2099
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,780
The years old drama.

2100
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:41,220
All right, somebody, please, anybody.

2101
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:42,380
Oh, was that the end of the mailbag?

2102
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,820
Yes, I told you.

2103
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:47,020
Let's close the mailbag and get back into the news, please.

2104
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:48,420
I blame Chris and Marissa for making me

2105
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:49,540
a Tiger Clawed

2106
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:50,780
That's all right.

2107
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:54,140
Anyways, Tiger Clawed is not Gaming Steve.

2108
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:55,980
That's Scott's issue.

2109
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,900
I don't even know Gaming Steve.

2110
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:00,300
Anyways, so speaking of idiotic, there's

2111
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:02,820
a brand new channel added to the Wii this week called

2112
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:07,940
Everybody Votes, which is not true, because not everybody

2113
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:08,860
does vote.

2114
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:09,660
They should.

2115
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:12,620
You should be locked out for, yeah, anyways.

2116
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:15,100
So yeah, the Everybody Votes channel,

2117
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:17,660
and you get to vote on such wonderful topics like,

2118
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,780
what's better, dogs or cats?

2119
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:21,620
Woo-hoo.

2120
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:22,940
Yay, that's fun.

2121
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:27,140
Worth my Wii to be flashing, by the way,

2122
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:30,060
and it's still flashing, because I have not turned it on

2123
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:31,860
since the stupid channel came out.

2124
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:35,660
But apparently, you can vote on these,

2125
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:37,700
you find out the results, and then it

2126
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:41,660
gets logged into your profile to how many you got right

2127
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,940
versus how many you got wrong.

2128
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:46,220
And I guess you can show people your Wii penis.

2129
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:48,500
To be honest, I wish this channel was Everybody Poops,

2130
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,260
because that would be a lot better.

2131
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:52,180
That would be true, but should that

2132
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:55,340
be a question, which do you prefer more in the bathroom,

2133
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:58,140
one or two?

2134
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,920
Well, with two, you can read.

2135
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,460
I mean, one, you're, anyway, this is disgusting.

2136
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,700
I actually think the channel is really cute.

2137
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,060
I didn't have a problem with it.

2138
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:09,940
I think it's, you know, it's not,

2139
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:13,100
like, it's the perfect kind of, Nintendo did not

2140
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,500
make any fanfare out of it.

2141
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:17,340
This is probably just something that used to be a tech demo.

2142
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,740
I mean, we're going to be seeing a lot of crap like this,

2143
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,860
but Nintendo did not try to sell this to anyone.

2144
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,620
They did not try to put it out, like, by the Wii,

2145
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:24,500
because we had the Everyone Votes channel.

2146
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,420
No, it's just like, hey, we're just

2147
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:28,100
going to put this up because we're bored.

2148
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,620
We're going to put up this Everyone Votes channel

2149
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:31,420
just because we have it, and here it is.

2150
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:33,660
And it reminds me of this old-ass game,

2151
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:35,120
and I can't even remember what the name of the game is.

2152
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,900
I hope somebody in chat remembers.

2153
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,020
But it was by the people that did Acrophobia,

2154
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:39,780
if you remember that game.

2155
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:40,980
It was, like, a game show type thing

2156
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:42,280
you could play on the computer.

2157
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,940
And there was one that, like, had a game where

2158
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:46,700
you were playing with, like, 50 other people,

2159
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:47,660
and there were polls.

2160
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,580
And you tried to guess how everybody else would answer,

2161
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,180
and you moved up this little pyramid,

2162
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,060
depending on how accurate you were.

2163
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:54,340
This really reminds me of that.

2164
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:58,900
It's not a game, per se, but it has tracked your predictions.

2165
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:01,900
And when I did the Dogs and Cats,

2166
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,500
I actually thought worldwide, because it's a worldwide catch

2167
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,340
on, I thought cats would be more popular.

2168
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,100
And I was wrong.

2169
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:09,260
And when the results came in, I was like, oh, I

2170
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:10,060
can't believe it.

2171
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,600
And I was like, oh, I kind of just

2172
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,380
got emotional over a video game, a stupid little thing.

2173
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:16,920
So I mean, it was a little thrill, and it's free.

2174
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,380
So I don't think it's a bad thing.

2175
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:20,740
I think it's cute.

2176
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,180
There are any kittens left because

2177
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:23,300
of all the masturbating.

2178
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:25,260
That's why.

2179
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:27,780
I see.

2180
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:29,060
All right, well, there you go.

2181
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:31,580
Did anybody else try the voting channel?

2182
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:33,540
I watched Extra for Do It last night.

2183
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:34,040
Was it?

2184
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,540
It was hot.

2185
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:36,500
Was it cute, though?

2186
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,980
I thought the channel was cute.

2187
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:42,020
I hate the entire world because cats are more awesome.

2188
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:44,780
Actually, I believe it was Switzerland

2189
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:46,700
where cats outrank dogs.

2190
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:48,500
So let's all move to Switzerland.

2191
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,260
We have a Norway listener in chat tonight.

2192
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:52,300
I love our Norwegian listener.

2193
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:57,060
So Olaf, we need to get Olaf a cat, Olaf the Viking a cat.

2194
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:00,740
I want pictures of, never mind, that's a Dr. Who reference.

2195
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:02,180
Anyhow, sorry.

2196
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:06,860
All right, so go vote if you want on your Wii right now.

2197
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:09,220
Another thing you can do on your Wii right now is download

2198
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:12,580
Kid Icarus, but you should know that some of the codes

2199
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:15,260
that you may remember from your childhood, they don't work.

2200
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:19,020
If you want to put in Icarus Fights Medusa Angels,

2201
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:20,700
that code is not going to work.

2202
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,500
There is a warning before you download it.

2203
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,980
It says the original Kid Icarus allows players

2204
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,140
to use secret passwords.

2205
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:28,300
However, Virtual Console does not support these passwords.

2206
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,300
And at first, I thought that meant passwords

2207
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,500
weren't going to work at all.

2208
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,740
And that's not true.

2209
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:37,940
You still can use the old little jumble 0080C whatever type

2210
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:39,120
passwords.

2211
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,980
It's just the secret ones won't work because apparently

2212
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:45,380
the original cartridge had an included module in it

2213
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:46,820
to process the special codes.

2214
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:48,820
I never realized that.

2215
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:52,740
But don't the emulators emulate those codes?

2216
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:54,700
So that seems so weird to me.

2217
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:57,780
Like if you play this on Nesticle or whatever

2218
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:03,580
those NES emulators are you use, can't you use those codes?

2219
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:04,180
Yeah.

2220
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:07,620
So I don't get it.

2221
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:08,820
Because they're lazy?

2222
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,900
Well, I don't know enough about hardware, I guess.

2223
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:13,340
Because they're too busy working on everybody votes to,

2224
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:16,060
I don't know, fix their Virtual Console stuff?

2225
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:19,300
I don't think everybody votes was already done

2226
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:23,020
in some capacity, I think, as some type of demonstration.

2227
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:23,780
It's not that.

2228
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:28,580
I'm talking about this thing here.

2229
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:30,180
But really, maybe it was just done

2230
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:32,500
so that people would have to see how fucking hard Kid

2231
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,980
Icarus really was.

2232
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:35,580
Because I think a lot of y'all forgot.

2233
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,740
Because you used to use those passwords to just beat

2234
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:38,260
the game.

2235
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:40,100
But Kid Icarus is fucking hard.

2236
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:41,540
It is, but it's awesome.

2237
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:42,060
It is.

2238
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:43,540
It's definitely worth your time.

2239
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:44,060
I love that game.

2240
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:44,940
It's worth $5.

2241
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,300
She's going to be in the middle.

2242
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:48,020
You'll never get a sequel.

2243
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,780
Never.

2244
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:52,540
Fuck you, I hate you.

2245
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:55,620
Well, speaking of the Virtual Console,

2246
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:57,380
we do actually have some other news.

2247
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:00,020
There's a few of the Japan only games

2248
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:03,220
that are going to be coming onto the US Virtual Console.

2249
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:06,420
It's pretty cool.

2250
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:08,380
It's actually with a conversation

2251
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:12,420
with Nintendo of America senior VP, George Harrison.

2252
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:15,380
They are looking into bringing some of the more successful

2253
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:19,740
Japanese franchises that have that cult following in the US

2254
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,180
on the Virtual Console.

2255
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:24,900
Basically, those of us who are the niche gamers, they love us.

2256
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:27,060
Nintendo loves us.

2257
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:28,220
That's proof.

2258
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:30,380
So they're talking about bringing over

2259
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:33,180
some of the games if they can have them translated properly.

2260
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:34,980
I'm sorry, but if they really loved us,

2261
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:37,180
they would have made the fucking thing region free.

2262
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:38,340
True.

2263
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:41,980
However, they still haven't given me Guardian Legend.

2264
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:43,660
Bastards.

2265
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:45,420
Guardian Legend is that game we will always

2266
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:47,700
bitch about that we will never get on Virtual Console.

2267
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:49,980
Guardian Legend is the actually.

2268
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,260
Greatest 8-bit game ever made.

2269
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:52,460
That's all that needs to be said.

2270
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:52,940
Indeed.

2271
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:56,420
And then it's followed by the greatest 16-bit game ever made.

2272
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,220
Rondo of Blood.

2273
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:00,660
Now, I think about wasn't the MSX announced

2274
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:02,940
as one of the systems they were going to emulate in Japan

2275
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:03,740
on Virtual Console?

2276
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:04,460
I do believe so.

2277
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:07,220
Because if we get an MSX emulator on here,

2278
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,700
do you know what that means we get?

2279
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:10,540
Metal fucking gear.

2280
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,980
The real sequel to Metal Gear 2?

2281
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:15,980
Dude, that's it right there.

2282
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:16,940
That's what I want.

2283
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:19,820
You write that right under Guardian Legend on the wishlist.

2284
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:22,180
On MSX, there were two Guardian Legend games.

2285
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:24,700
That would be on the same list of, yeah, sure.

2286
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:28,780
We'll implement online before we implement this shit.

2287
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,740
Fuck you, I hate you.

2288
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:32,340
But on the MSX, there actually were two Guardian Legend games.

2289
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,380
It's called Guardia.

2290
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:35,380
I've heard of Guardia.

2291
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:38,100
I've never played it, but that would be hot.

2292
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:39,300
I would settle for Guardia.

2293
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:43,940
I had a photograph of it once that my MSX emulator

2294
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:45,420
wouldn't run, so I was so upset.

2295
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:51,340
And I'm sure that everyone's going to be, well,

2296
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:53,940
I don't know if anyone's really going to be interested in this,

2297
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:56,100
but apparently they're putting out Brunswick Pro

2298
01:43:56,100 --> 01:44:01,300
Bowling for Nintendo Wii, the PlayStation 2, and PSP.

2299
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:08,180
Honestly, ask yourself, when ever, ever,

2300
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:10,100
other than Wii Bowling, has there ever

2301
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:13,260
been a good bowling game on any console?

2302
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:15,300
You just said it, Wii Bowling.

2303
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:16,580
Other than Wii Bowling.

2304
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:18,500
The Tekken bowling game on Tekken.

2305
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,540
Oh, shush.

2306
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,060
It was fun.

2307
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:23,220
For three seconds.

2308
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:26,900
Can I be really lame and not console oriented

2309
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:30,020
and say that elf bowling was awesome?

2310
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,300
Whee!

2311
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:35,700
How about, what's the one they had at the Metreon years ago,

2312
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:37,780
Mega Bowling, or whatever that thing was for you?

2313
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:40,020
Touch Bowling, the one with the, no, that wasn't at the Metreon.

2314
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:41,140
This was the giant ball.

2315
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:42,260
Dave & Busters has it, too.

2316
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:43,980
Dave & Busters, with the giant screen.

2317
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:44,860
Ahead of the Metron, too.

2318
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:46,700
I remember this, because we played it there.

2319
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:50,500
And Neo Geo Bowling, Ryoma says, and Clubhouse Games.

2320
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,900
But because everybody loves Wii Bowling,

2321
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,140
somebody said, let's turn this into an actual full-fledged

2322
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:55,540
game.

2323
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:56,340
Yeah, that's great.

2324
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:58,460
Let's charge something that you can get, I don't know,

2325
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:58,960
for free.

2326
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,940
There's a pinball game called 9 Pin.

2327
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:02,620
Well, let's just make another game that's

2328
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:06,060
exactly the same as the last one and charge you money for it.

2329
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:08,300
That's OK, because it's Brunswick Pro Bowling.

2330
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:11,060
And I'm sure, to be honest, though, when it does come out,

2331
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:15,500
it'd be like $20, so who gives a shit?

2332
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,180
I mean, it's going to be cheap.

2333
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:20,260
I mean, God crave.

2334
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,820
I mean, I don't know.

2335
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:27,820
The last, what was it, the last, they had some, I want to say,

2336
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:31,180
Extreme Bowling 2006 that came out last year.

2337
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:33,460
It was uber lame, by the way.

2338
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:40,300
So hopefully, they will go with the same kind of gameplay

2339
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,660
as Wii Bowling, but somehow, I think

2340
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:46,780
they're going to fuck it up, because they always fuck it up.

2341
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:47,620
Comments from chat.

2342
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:50,460
James Patrick says, Elf Bowling, shooter.

2343
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:56,260
DJ Jenai says, Elf Bowling, it's more fun if you're drunk.

2344
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:58,700
DJ Dark Knight says, Simpson Bowling.

2345
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:01,660
Alpha Canagram agrees, Tekken Bowling.

2346
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:03,700
Gaming Nerd says, let's throw our Wiimotes directly

2347
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:04,900
into our TVs and break them.

2348
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:08,020
Oops, I thought I was holding a bowling ball.

2349
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:11,780
At Def says, what I do want is a new baseball game for the Wii.

2350
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:15,740
And Tiger Claw remembers, guys, what about Hyper Bowling?

2351
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,860
It came with Microsoft Plus for the XP.

2352
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:18,660
That's what it was.

2353
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,100
It was called Hyper Bowling, but you actually

2354
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:21,940
had a bowling ball, because that was the version of it

2355
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,100
that they had in the arcades.

2356
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:25,060
It was Hyper Bowling, but with an actual ball that you roll.

2357
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:26,140
Anyway, forget it.

2358
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:30,140
But I was excited that Tiger Claw reminded me

2359
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:32,940
of the name of that.

2360
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:34,380
Is that it, or any more stories?

2361
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:35,420
Oh, next story is mine.

2362
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,140
Whoops, my bad.

2363
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:38,620
Ha ha, fail.

2364
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:41,220
And it has to do with one of my very favorite countries,

2365
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:43,300
the only other country I've really been to.

2366
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:43,980
I can remember.

2367
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,260
I went to the Caribbean when I was seven,

2368
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:46,180
but that doesn't count.

2369
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:48,420
So the only other country I've really been to is Canada.

2370
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:53,780
And Canada, even though we have a lot of Canadian listeners,

2371
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:56,300
things are kind of quiet gaming-wise in Canada.

2372
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:58,860
I mean, sure, you got some of the game studios in Toronto,

2373
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:00,940
Vancouver, but for the most part,

2374
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:03,240
you don't hear a whole lot of big gaming news coming out

2375
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:03,740
of Canada.

2376
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:04,620
Well, now guess what?

2377
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:07,860
ESA has their sights set on Canada,

2378
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:11,340
because apparently Canada has pirates galore.

2379
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:16,780
I think they're confusing pirates

2380
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:18,660
with maple syrup or hockey.

2381
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:22,540
A coalition of American media industry trade groups

2382
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:24,860
is asking the US government to say

2383
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:28,180
that Canada is on the list of the world's worst countries

2384
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:30,220
when it comes to enforcing intellectual property

2385
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:32,460
rights and fighting piracy.

2386
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:35,060
This was from the seven-member IIPA,

2387
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:37,480
International Intellectual Property Alliance.

2388
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:38,940
And they're saying that Canada has

2389
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:41,880
failed to deliver on promises of more stringent copyright laws

2390
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,940
and stepped up enforcements for laws already on the books.

2391
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:48,380
Quote, Canada remains far behind virtually all of its peers

2392
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:50,680
in the industrialized world with respect to its efforts

2393
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,480
to bring its copyright laws up to date

2394
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:55,500
with the realities of the global digital networked environment.

2395
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,560
Indeed, even the major developing countries

2396
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:59,740
have progressed further and faster than Canada

2397
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:01,180
in meeting the challenge.

2398
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:04,900
Insert mandatory playing Canada joke here.

2399
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:07,880
Hey, I just have a personal experience.

2400
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:09,820
All my Canadian friends love Warcraft,

2401
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:11,700
but then again, who doesn't, and pot,

2402
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:17,660
and preferably at the same time, which really confused me.

2403
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:22,020
So what does a Canadian pirate look like?

2404
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,540
I don't know.

2405
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:26,460
Jack Sparrow that kind of smells like maple?

2406
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,300
I don't know.

2407
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:30,420
No, I have this image of like a bobsled that looks like a ship

2408
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:33,140
with a sail on it and dogs.

2409
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:34,940
Are mush.

2410
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:35,980
No.

2411
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:38,660
I'm going to Canada later this year.

2412
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:39,220
That's good.

2413
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:40,140
Canada is a fun place.

2414
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:43,980
And I'm going to find me a Canadian pirate.

2415
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:45,740
Maybe he'll find your booty.

2416
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:54,340
What the fuck is a ferret?

2417
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:55,340
It's a ferret joke.

2418
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:56,820
Look, a ferret's been absorbed.

2419
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:57,980
I'll hit myself with Kirby.

2420
01:48:57,980 --> 01:48:58,660
There you have me.

2421
01:48:58,660 --> 01:48:59,780
Isn't that DNL's Kirby?

2422
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:00,740
It's DNL's Kirby.

2423
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:01,740
She needs to come get it.

2424
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:02,740
DNL, you need to come get your Kirby.

2425
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:04,900
Because I'm getting my cooby cootie coobies.

2426
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:08,180
I'm getting my cooties all over this Kirby that DMN brought.

2427
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:08,740
On my nipple.

2428
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:09,340
Look at that.

2429
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,900
There you go.

2430
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,380
Just for you, Renee.

2431
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:14,260
He's sexing it up for you.

2432
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:17,460
Well, I have some uses better than blaming Canada for shit.

2433
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,060
What's that?

2434
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:20,180
Well, actually, it's not really all that exciting.

2435
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:23,180
But DirecTV has something called Game Lounge now.

2436
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:26,340
And it's this interactive channel for family stuff

2437
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:28,380
that you'd get played through your satellite box.

2438
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:31,460
So it's like Xbox Live suck edition.

2439
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:36,260
It has games that are based on kid shows like SpongeBob.

2440
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:40,140
And it has competitive games where you can compete

2441
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,380
for prizes and money.

2442
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:44,700
And you should check it out, I guess,

2443
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:48,340
if you are into family games.

2444
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:50,220
I like for my games to have blood and sex.

2445
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:51,700
Gaming Lounge?

2446
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:52,820
It's called Game Lounge.

2447
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:53,340
Game Lounge.

2448
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:55,620
Was Orange Lounge taken?

2449
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:56,860
Oh, I guess it was.

2450
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:58,900
Didn't we contemplate changing the name of the show

2451
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:00,100
to Game Lounge at one point?

2452
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:00,620
No.

2453
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:04,300
Because I thought we did.

2454
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:05,820
Then maybe I'd put that, because we

2455
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:07,260
were having those problems with nobody

2456
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,220
understands that Orange Lounge Radio is a gaming

2457
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:11,640
show, because people don't get the Orange Lounge reference

2458
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:12,980
with DDR and Bimani.

2459
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:15,700
But that's why this year was me.

2460
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:16,540
You know what, Rob?

2461
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:17,940
We did have a conversation on that one.

2462
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:20,020
You said, hey, what if we change our name to Game Lounge?

2463
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:20,780
And we both went, no.

2464
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:21,460
Yeah, exactly.

2465
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:22,260
Just like that.

2466
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:23,620
Yeah, it was just like that.

2467
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:28,380
This was a dramatic recreation.

2468
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:30,340
Hey, guys, I have this really great idea.

2469
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:32,100
No.

2470
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:32,660
That was it.

2471
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:34,020
That was it right there.

2472
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:37,540
That was the recreation.

2473
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:41,380
Just shot down again by Jamie.

2474
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:42,100
Rob?

2475
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:42,580
What?

2476
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:44,300
Heart.

2477
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:47,260
All right.

2478
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:51,260
Anyhow, we've gone very long, this statement,

2479
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:52,540
almost two hours.

2480
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:54,700
Marissa, can you believe this show is only half over?

2481
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:00,860
If this is torture, then chain me to the wall.

2482
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:02,940
But the listeners like it when it's long.

2483
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:06,660
I bet you guys like it long, don't you?

2484
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,060
You like it long.

2485
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:10,020
All right, well, we're going to take a quick break,

2486
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:12,100
and we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge

2487
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:15,900
Radio with part B of our show.

2488
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:18,860
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights

2489
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:21,380
and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

2490
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:24,020
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion

2491
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:51,420
of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
