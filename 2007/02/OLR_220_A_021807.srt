00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:20,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, February 18th, 2007, new arcade games are revealed, including Tekken 6 and Silent Hill.

2
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:27,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone in the know violates Microsoft's partner, NetNDA, and could rare be developing something for a Nintendo platform?

3
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:36,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:44,456
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about and a little bit of gaming culture, geek culture, pop culture types affair.

5
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:47,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here to help you through the next few hours of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:52,181
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

7
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:54,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, the angsty, loud Dark Sakura.

8
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:55,343
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

9
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:57,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate people.

10
00:00:58,505 --> 00:00:59,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to hear it.

11
00:00:59,045 --> 00:00:59,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you hate people?

12
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:01,519
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,742
[SPEAKER_04]: and what I noticed is that I was very loud, so I apologize for that.

14
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:33,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've adjusted the audio for this week.

15
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,924
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay, we're used to it.

16
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:38,208
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the playback, because it's a lowered bitrate on the podcast, it didn't sound as bad.

17
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:39,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't sound as tin canny.

18
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:39,609
[SPEAKER_04]: As usual.

19
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:40,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think it'll be so bad.

20
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,812
[SPEAKER_04]: The show sucked, but I was good.

21
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:44,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

22
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:46,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

23
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:48,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

24
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:49,597
[SPEAKER_06]: That's surprising.

25
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:50,257
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I...

26
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:58,397
[SPEAKER_04]: What the... Doing it the whole time and you're like... Have you been like snorting crack today?

27
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,937
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I had a frappuccino.

28
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:00,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, goody.

29
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:02,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

30
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:03,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another one of those shows.

31
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,359
[SPEAKER_11]: A crackuccino.

32
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello as well to Loki.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,100
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot that I turned the mic off so I didn't catch that last comment.

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,742
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I didn't call you Tech Mask to Loki tonight because apparently you forgot how to work sound equipment.

35
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:14,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

36
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:15,122
[SPEAKER_04]: The winner is you.

37
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:15,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

38
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:16,883
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope you have enjoyed.

39
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:18,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I know how to use sound equipment.

40
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:20,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you?

41
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:21,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

42
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:21,604
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

43
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have some special guests with us in studio tonight.

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,020
[SPEAKER_09]: They're extra special.

45
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,780
[SPEAKER_09]: They have their own bus.

46
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be another very interesting week here at Orange Launch Radio.

47
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:34,282
[SPEAKER_04]: The feedback from last week is that you guys liked a little bit of the silliness we had going on last week.

48
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So we brought some of the silliest people we know to the program.

49
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:42,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to one of the Orange Launch Radio... Oh, God damn it.

50
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:46,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I get the mailbag.

51
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:47,686
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no mailbag for you.

52
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:48,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

53
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:49,832
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

54
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:21,617
[SPEAKER_04]: and also say hello to somebody brand new.

55
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:25,019
[SPEAKER_04]: She's losing her Orange Lounge cherry tonight.

56
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,420
[SPEAKER_04]: She's brand new to the program.

57
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:34,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Marissa.

58
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

59
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:37,228
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Marissa?

60
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:38,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it when you talk nerdy to me.

61
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,390
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

62
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:43,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa is the originator of Utus Braziers.

63
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:50,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to point out, whatever brazier Marissa has on tonight, you know, I might be gay, but I can't help but look.

64
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Marissa, you have to do it for the listeners so that they hear the original Utus Braziers.

65
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I do it right now or later?

66
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:58,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, why not?

67
00:03:58,274 --> 00:03:58,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

68
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:01,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Utus Braziers thing originated because...

69
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, A, B, H, H, H, H, no.

70
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:16,518
[SPEAKER_01]: For all you nerds out there, I am wearing a... I'm a geek too, I'm just a music geek.

71
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a double G. So my sisters were complaining about the types of bras that they get to wear.

72
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:28,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought this was the most ridiculous thing ever, because it is awkward changing in the, uh, in the locker room.

73
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:36,005
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have all these choices, you know, Spangly this, and Clear Strats this, and that, and, you know, Zebra Bras, and all they get to wear are UTA'S BRAZERS!

74
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:39,228
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Nazi bras from the Third Reich!

75
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,230
[SPEAKER_05]: You will wear them, and you will like them!

76
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:45,432
[SPEAKER_05]: In old country, teeth did not fly free.

77
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:46,773
[SPEAKER_05]: They were disciplined!

78
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:49,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And they stood at attention like rockets!

79
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:53,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

80
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:55,068
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I came from.

81
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we have our chat room.

82
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:02,592
[SPEAKER_04]: We would never have a show complete without our chat room.

83
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:04,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the chat room going insane?

84
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:09,256
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute Marissa said double G's.

85
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:13,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Alpha Catagram says double G. Shadows Liar says this is the best show ever.

86
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:22,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireboma says keep this girl alright but now because the show is about video games we need to kind of confess Marissa you're not a hardcore gamer are you?

87
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:27,624
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because I've been depressed ever since they stopped making King's Quest.

88
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:31,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but so you did, you used to play like the old school adventure games, right?

89
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:32,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was obsessed with it, yeah.

90
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I was obsessed with the, yeah, all of them.

91
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:38,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard about the King's Quest fan project, the Silver Lining?

92
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:40,270
[SPEAKER_04]: We host the demo on Orangelandradio.com.

93
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:48,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't heard of the brand new one, although I downloaded, I guess, Tierra as opposed to Sierra made remakes of the really, really old school ones.

94
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded those.

95
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:50,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I remember, yeah, hearing about that.

96
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:50,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

97
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:50,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

98
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,700
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

99
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,491
[SPEAKER_01]: It did get a little boring.

100
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:21,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's tough to live up to the classics, you know, when people say, oh, there's this new game out and it's like the classics, but then you play it and it's really not, you know.

101
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:25,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true, but I think a lot of the appeal of the adventure games was the humor.

102
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:26,997
[SPEAKER_01]: In Siberia, I kind of lacked that.

103
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:28,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been eaten by a grue.

104
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:32,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, Jared J. in chat says, she loves King's Quest?

105
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, marry me.

106
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:35,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa's taken, yes.

107
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:41,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes, but for a little self-whoring, myspace.com slash Marissa Mizell, M-A-R-I-S-S-A

108
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:43,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a musician.

109
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:56,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you!

110
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And that whole thing?

111
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:21,953
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool, that's cool.

112
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I was going to say, as a legitimate musician, what do you think about Guitar Hero?

113
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:30,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

114
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a good ho, ho, ho, or a bad ho, ho, ho?

115
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:34,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what?

116
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:37,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quickly, so we can get to the crux of the show here.

117
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:38,305
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of Guitar Hero?

118
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:39,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Good thing, bad thing?

119
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:40,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already sworn on this show.

120
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:40,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I allowed to again?

121
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:43,209
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the internet.

122
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, shit, cock, cunt, piss, whore, whatever you want.

123
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking hate Guitar Hero!

124
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:48,453
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

125
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you hate Guitar Hero?

126
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:55,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess it's fun, but learning to play guitar gets you laid.

127
00:07:57,696 --> 00:08:00,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Playing video game guitar does not.

128
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:13,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it's only good fun, and I like that it brings attention to classic music, but the most interesting part is that musicians suck at Guitar Hero, just like real dancers suck at DDR.

129
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:14,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.

130
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,480
[SPEAKER_04]: They have videos of guys on the Internet playing their own songs on Guitar Heroes, and they fucking suck at them.

131
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:19,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sad.

132
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:22,136
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really, really funny.

133
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:31,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Megzi, when she has a Guitar Hero demo set up at her GameStop, and they sit there and they ask her, so does this teach you how to play a real guitar?

134
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:33,368
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes, no, it doesn't.

135
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,010
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but that's what it advertises.

136
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,991
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it doesn't.

137
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:40,556
[SPEAKER_06]: And she has to get through to people to tell them it does not teach you how to play guitar.

138
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:43,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to say Jared Jay has changed his mind on Marissa.

139
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit, now I hate you.

140
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And I quote, I quote, go fuck a goat.

141
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:51,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

142
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,447
[SPEAKER_01]: But classic rock is good.

143
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:57,770
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll learn to embrace when the listeners tell you to go fuck things.

144
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I like go fuck a cactus.

145
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:01,553
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite.

146
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:03,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that give me any points?

147
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:04,316
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

148
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess is going to make a cameo real quick.

149
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:07,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I agree.

150
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:09,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Marissa Rice Princess.

151
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm introducing myself.

152
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:11,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Chris.

153
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to meet you.

154
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what's up, Rice Princess?

155
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:13,850
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

156
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm sick.

157
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,352
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought a posse with you.

158
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:16,632
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this?

159
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:17,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought my posse.

160
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Introduce your posse real quick.

161
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:19,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this is Chance.

162
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:20,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up?

163
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quickly, because we're not going to have time to have air bands show.

164
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:23,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Chance, what type of games do you like?

165
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,022
[SPEAKER_03]: PS2 games, like RPG games.

166
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:28,163
[SPEAKER_03]: RPG games?

167
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:28,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Action games.

168
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:29,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

169
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:31,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, and World of Warcraft?

170
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, yeah.

171
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:33,788
[SPEAKER_04]: How about, wait, board games, like Cold Step?

172
00:09:34,502 --> 00:09:36,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play video games, do I?

173
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:57,299
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't play video games.

174
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:57,819
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays WoW.

175
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,940
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not picking him up on the mic either.

176
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,140
[SPEAKER_04]: But he says he doesn't play video games.

177
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Chris, and I am a butt.

178
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,441
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, video games suck.

179
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:05,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is Heather.

180
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:06,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Heather.

181
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:07,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Come up real quick.

182
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,082
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Heather?

183
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:09,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, how are you?

184
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:10,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

185
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:11,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you play video games?

186
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:12,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of.

187
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:13,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a button masher, sorry to say.

188
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Button masher?

189
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,083
[SPEAKER_04]: What type of games do you play?

190
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:16,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the mic a little closer to your mouth.

191
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo, Soul Collaborator, Burnout.

192
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:20,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you any good at Gears of War?

193
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:21,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Never played it.

194
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:27,597
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking for some good players for Gears of War for something I can't talk about yet.

195
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:31,901
[SPEAKER_04]: But we need to put together a team for Gears of War, and I'm very scared.

196
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:34,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

197
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:35,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick that one up and check it out.

198
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:36,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

199
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:37,726
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me know how it goes.

200
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:39,267
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

201
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:40,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is this now, Rice Princess?

202
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:43,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this like one of those swelled ego things after the last show?

203
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:47,293
[SPEAKER_04]: You got like a fan letter, and now you have this swelled ego.

204
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:47,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what?

205
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I got two.

206
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,216
[SPEAKER_04]: She has to have an entourage everywhere she goes.

207
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I got two fan letters now.

208
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm taking over your show now.

209
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:54,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Rob.

210
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that I'm moving in?

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Again?

212
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,201
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be the last week of Orange Lounge Radio.

213
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:03,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you enjoyed the program while it lasted.

214
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:03,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

215
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:04,662
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

216
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:06,323
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

217
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:07,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Irene was here from show one.

218
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:09,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Irene, you were here for show one, weren't you?

219
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:10,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally was.

220
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,244
[SPEAKER_04]: That was three studios ago.

221
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, seriously.

222
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:12,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember.

223
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:16,086
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, just like old times, you should go clean my kitchen.

224
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:18,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like old times, I should punch you in your gob.

225
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:19,227
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

226
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:22,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan repaired our whodunit, so I actually played some pinball.

227
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought my PS2 over here and we never played it.

228
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:49,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard you brought it over here for Silent Hill, but the Miglatov was like, no, my panties are bunched too tight, I can't play Silent Hill tonight.

229
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:50,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I also brought Crazy Taxi and we didn't play it.

230
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:51,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy money.

231
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:53,467
[SPEAKER_04]: For PS2?

232
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:54,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

233
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,168
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only play that on Dreamcast, I'm sorry.

234
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:58,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just grabbed a handful of stuff.

235
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:58,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

236
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:01,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

237
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:02,651
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

238
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:03,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

239
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:03,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing else?

240
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:04,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

241
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:05,353
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of slow.

242
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:06,733
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright, that's alright.

243
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:07,354
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a busy girl.

244
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:08,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't play games all the time.

245
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

246
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:11,676
[SPEAKER_11]: My gaming week was fun.

247
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:16,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I played all... Basically, I just played only Crackdown.

248
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:18,112
[SPEAKER_11]: The full Crackdown.

249
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:19,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you got the retail release, right?

250
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:20,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

251
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:22,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you're one of those bastards that got it early.

252
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:23,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Because street dates don't apply to me.

253
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:26,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, sorry.

254
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,204
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, I'm about two-thirds way through the game already, and it's worth it.

255
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:37,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I really cannot wait until everyone else gets it so I can play some co-op.

256
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:45,516
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's actually pretty funny, because if you watch some of the AI, like, especially the AI drivers, they're horrible.

257
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:52,761
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I was trying to kill this one guy, and I heard all this crashing going on below me, and there was a freeway below me.

258
00:12:52,841 --> 00:13:01,949
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, you know, got on the edge and looked down, and there was this giant pileup of cars, and you can actually see cars being ejected out of the tunnel and just getting thrown into the ocean.

259
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,930
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was hilarious, and I had nothing to do with it.

260
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,852
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just the crabby AI drivers...

261
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:09,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Just crash into each other and just launch cars into the air.

262
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:14,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Some crackdown comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

263
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

264
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:20,676
[SPEAKER_04]: OLArmyBlaze says, Okay, well, whoop-de-fucking-do, Mr. I work in distribution.

265
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:23,638
[SPEAKER_04]: But JeremyTel1 has a serious question.

266
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:26,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, is the game too easy like I think it will be?

267
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, are all the bosses really easy to kill once you start leveling up?

268
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:35,287
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets harder as you go on because the first, the Los Maritos bosses are, you know, pretty easy.

269
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:36,522
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

270
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:04,577
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want more of a challenge, play on a harder difficulty.

271
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:13,643
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think you'll be at least... Play through the whole game, and then if you want to go back and play it harder, definitely play the more challenging difficulties.

272
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:18,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, as it is, it gets kind of hard, especially when you get towards the last gang, the Asian gang.

273
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:23,209
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, they're crazy, the amount of people that they throw at you.

274
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it does get harder, though.

275
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:29,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else in your gaming week besides Crackdown?

276
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:30,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Crackdown?

277
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:53,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories still still after all this time oh yeah we'll be playing until the next game comes out alright one other question here Jay Dorian asks Loki how does the full games world compare to the demo how much bigger does it feel well the demo it was just pretty much half of the first island it's not even the whole first island and the game feels huge I mean like

278
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,252
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't recognize certain areas of the game.

279
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you can get lost pretty easy in it.

280
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,894
[SPEAKER_11]: So it does feel very large.

281
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:03,415
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a ton of places to explore.

282
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:07,598
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been practically everywhere in the first two islands or whatever.

283
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:19,744
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've only found about less than a third of the secret orbs and just over half of the agility orbs.

284
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:21,905
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've already maxed out my...

285
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:27,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Strength, and I'm about to max out my explosives.

286
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:33,387
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, there's just a ton of stuff to explore.

287
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:34,427
[SPEAKER_11]: I did like the achievement.

288
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:37,107
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one achievement for killing people with this globe.

289
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,968
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a giant globe that you find at the observatory.

290
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:41,008
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

291
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:47,250
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a giant metal globe, and you have to kill 15 people with it, and that was fun.

292
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,630
[SPEAKER_04]: You bowl them over or something?

293
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that.

294
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,211
[SPEAKER_11]: You basically kind of toss it onto them.

295
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:51,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Throw it at their head.

296
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:56,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, throw it at their head Interesting I kill people all the time by throwing things at their head

297
00:15:57,526 --> 00:16:05,428
[SPEAKER_11]: The fun part's going to be coming to, I think, the co-op gameplay, because you can just run around and do whatever the fuck you want in that game.

298
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:14,530
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be fun, and what's kind of neat about it, and you don't really notice this in the demo, the full game, you can actually have people jump in and out of your game while you're playing.

299
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:15,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard about that.

300
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:19,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds pretty intuitive, but is that as good as it sounds, you think?

301
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:23,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's just going to be people jumping in and out, and you don't necessarily have to play with them.

302
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:25,693
[SPEAKER_11]: They can go fuck around your city or whatever.

303
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:27,794
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's going to be kind of cool.

304
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:39,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember hearing a long time ago one of the first downloads that they were going to have for Crackdown was a replay editor or something like that where you can record your own gameplay.

305
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,321
[SPEAKER_11]: So that might be pretty fun to share that with people.

306
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:44,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

307
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:45,463
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

308
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:47,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quickly, I haven't done a lot this week.

309
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:52,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally have taken a WoW character, World of Warcraft, further than I ever have before.

310
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:53,708
[SPEAKER_04]: My character...

311
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:59,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have Burning Crusade yet because I don't see the point of getting it if I'm not gonna...

312
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:24,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Blood Elves are awesome, but seriously, on my server, everyone is playing Blood Elves.

313
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:25,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone.

314
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:32,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also play Paperboy, which is awesome, on the Xbox 360, the old game.

315
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:35,697
[SPEAKER_04]: It translates pretty well to the Xbox 360, I gotta say.

316
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the game itself was kind of widescreen, like a little bit.

317
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you remember the old cabinet it was in, it was kind of widescreen.

318
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:45,185
[SPEAKER_04]: So they didn't have to smoosh it or anything, and the vertical bars aren't quite as big.

319
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,166
[SPEAKER_04]: The achievements are kind of smart.

320
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:51,267
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not like really super duper easy, but not super duper hard either like the previous games.

321
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,428
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think Paperboy itself was a much harder game than I remember.

322
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:57,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Paperboy is one of those like few truly original games.

323
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely I recommend you guys check out the demo if you're 360 owners.

324
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you never played Paperboy, at least, you know, play the first level that the demo gives you.

325
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:11,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you'll find it's creative enough and original enough of a game to necessitate buying the full game.

326
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:21,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have co-op modes, and I think there's a competitive mode, I can't remember, because I haven't taken it online yet, because most of my week's been on Warcraft, unfortunately.

327
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:27,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to get more achievements in Fusion Frenzy 2, but honestly, I couldn't tolerate the game long enough to do it.

328
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:31,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I got so fed up, I was like, oh my god, this game sucks, I turned it off.

329
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:33,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, it's not worth it.

330
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:37,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what achievement point challenges are going on right now, I will earn them somewhere else.

331
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:38,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do it.

332
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:40,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Fusion Frenzy 2 is just that bad.

333
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:41,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigh.

334
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:43,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris, how was your gaming week?

335
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:47,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I have become a World of Warcraft nerd.

336
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:48,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations!

337
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:49,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, clap for me.

338
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:50,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I need it.

339
00:18:50,549 --> 00:19:00,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, yeah, I just, I'm on only two of the servers, which is, one is the noob one, which is where everyone starts out, Hydraxis, I think.

340
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:01,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I can't pronounce names.

341
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:05,874
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got like ten characters on there that haven't even reached level fifteen.

342
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:07,994
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, you gotta start somewhere.

343
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:12,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then I've got, but I have Burning Crusades, because if I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get all of it.

344
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:26,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really funny, on both the elves, because, you know, when you start off a new character, they all start with that little cinema, and they all say it with the elves, it's like, it's like the elves, like, the last of their races, everybody is a fucking elf.

345
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:32,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone is a blood elf, everyone is a night elf, they're all, like, they're all over the frickin' place.

346
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:34,723
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, last of my, last of the race, my ass.

347
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:38,687
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Draenei, oh my god, I don't care what anyone says, those things are hot.

348
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:39,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Draenei.

349
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:41,168
[SPEAKER_04]: The Draenei girls are pretty hot.

350
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:44,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Ugh, their Russian accents make me horny.

351
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:49,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't hold back.

352
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I love those things so much.

353
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:54,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were supposed to be something else, but I like them being aliens.

354
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:54,932
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amusing.

355
00:19:54,972 --> 00:20:00,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I hear the Draenei females speak, though, I can't help but think, Boris, look, it's Musa and Drew.

356
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:01,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was Musa and Drew.

357
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:03,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Another Age.

358
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,310
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just love those things.

359
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if anyone wants to find me, I mean...

360
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:11,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to Jamie's MySpace.

361
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:11,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on MySpace.

362
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,758
[SPEAKER_06]: You're in my top eight.

363
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:14,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in her top eight.

364
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:16,500
[SPEAKER_06]: You're in the Orange Lounge top, actually.

365
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:17,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I am?

366
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:17,641
[SPEAKER_04]: You are.

367
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:19,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel so special.

368
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:19,883
[SPEAKER_04]: You are.

369
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:21,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me a note.

370
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:22,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you who I am.

371
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:23,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, I suck.

372
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:24,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to type in general yet.

373
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:28,390
[SPEAKER_06]: So if somebody knows, please inform me.

374
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously don't.

375
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:30,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I know how to type.

376
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:31,793
[SPEAKER_04]: You type slash one.

377
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:32,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

378
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Slash one, space, and then whatever you want to say.

379
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:35,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goddammit.

380
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:39,539
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like interesting things pop up, and it's really funny when the horde shows up.

381
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

382
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:10,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I'm on the Horde side, definitely.

383
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:11,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.

384
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:16,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got both, but... Now that they have Blood Elves, you're starting to see a lot of the noobness on the Horde side.

385
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:19,880
[SPEAKER_06]: The Blood Elf males are the only ones that I can stand because they're not all butch.

386
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're very gay.

387
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:21,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I love them.

388
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:24,863
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so... It's like, can I help you?

389
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:29,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking and Uni is jumping up and down going, ooh, it's slash one, type slash one.

390
00:21:30,727 --> 00:21:31,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

391
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Uni's being very helpful.

392
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:33,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

393
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:34,788
[SPEAKER_06]: She's noob friendly.

394
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:44,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people come up to me, you know what, that game is the most, WoW is the most frustrating fucking game in the world because there are people walking around you and I'm not used to that.

395
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not used to MMOs.

396
00:21:46,111 --> 00:21:46,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never played them.

397
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:49,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And so somebody comes up to me, do you want to duel?

398
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:50,952
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you, decline.

399
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:52,204
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

400
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:23,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give me that look!

401
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:25,539
[SPEAKER_04]: God, she gives me that look every time I offer to pay for something!

402
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:25,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

403
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,144
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about it after the show.

404
00:22:53,884 --> 00:22:54,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I got that look.

405
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:57,566
[SPEAKER_04]: All you need to do is some sweet lovin'.

406
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:01,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to go on break right now.

407
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll be right back, guys.

408
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:06,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, wow.

409
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,311
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the hottest episode of Orange Lounge ever.

410
00:23:09,952 --> 00:23:14,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe we're offering to eat pussy over World of Warcraft.

411
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:18,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls are going to eat each other out over World of Warcraft.

412
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:22,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.

413
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:24,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.

414
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:26,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, to quote Randall, I love the cock.

415
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to defend myself here.

416
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:31,701
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

417
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:34,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

418
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:34,402
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

419
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:35,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Cock love and Marissa.

420
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:38,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

421
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:39,504
[SPEAKER_08]: How many of us have shoes off?

422
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:41,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my shoes off.

423
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:43,986
[SPEAKER_05]: My half-Japanese boyfriend would kick my ass.

424
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa takes off her shoes, then it's a Mississippi orgy?

425
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:47,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Mississippi orgy!

426
00:23:47,914 --> 00:23:48,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

427
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:51,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain the Mississippi orgy thing again for anybody who's new.

428
00:23:51,257 --> 00:24:03,188
[SPEAKER_09]: State law in Mississippi is that if three or more people, and at least one of them is, I think, nope, it's three or more people with one person of an opposite gender in the room, it's an orgy.

429
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:05,250
[SPEAKER_09]: With your socks and shoes off.

430
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:07,208
[SPEAKER_09]: or with your shoes off, I'm sorry.

431
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:07,749
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

432
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:11,810
[SPEAKER_09]: We are having a Mississippi orgy on Orange Sound Radio.

433
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, I disagree, Rob.

434
00:24:13,591 --> 00:24:15,732
[SPEAKER_04]: The episode with the Mississippi orgy was the hottest episode ever.

435
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:16,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here you go.

436
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:17,952
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I told Marissa to take off her shoes.

437
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:19,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Return of the Mississippi orgy.

438
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:23,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we need some shine and we're set!

439
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:46,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's the first gaming system where I actually went, ooh, I want it.

440
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:59,578
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is a very profound thing we're talking about here because, you know, you read – from our perspective as hardcore gamers, you're always reading on the game blogs about Nintendo's trying to get the casual gamers back into gaming.

441
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:02,079
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we get the casual gamers back into gaming?

442
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ask you, what – I mean, you're saying the DS is the first system you have ever bought with your own money.

443
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:07,562
[SPEAKER_04]: What –

444
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,100
[SPEAKER_04]: What made you do it?

445
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've always been broke, so that has something to do with the fact that I didn't have one before.

446
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:21,163
[SPEAKER_01]: But quite frankly, a lot of, I mean, no, PC gaming isn't the equivalent to an entire, you know, to a game system.

447
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:22,623
[SPEAKER_09]: She wants Link's ass.

448
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:23,003
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

449
00:25:23,503 --> 00:25:24,323
[SPEAKER_09]: She wants Link's ass.

450
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,784
[SPEAKER_04]: TheRobD says, every chick I know is excited about the Wii.

451
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:29,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I know every chick.

452
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:31,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the gaming system, never mind.

453
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it?

454
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh, uh-huh, give me that.

455
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:47,931
[SPEAKER_01]: But the DS just offered something completely new as far as the touchscreen interface, and you could play a game away in advance, which was cool, you know, double deal.

456
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's accessible.

457
00:25:51,943 --> 00:25:57,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really is for people like me who are kind of dyslexic and all the buttons and the functions, etc.

458
00:25:57,705 --> 00:25:59,166
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that's what they say sometimes.

459
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:03,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the fact that you look at an Xbox 360 controller and you're like, too many buttons.

460
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:04,647
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is that?

461
00:26:04,747 --> 00:26:06,248
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a spaceship.

462
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the original controller was a fucking spaceship.

463
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:12,130
[SPEAKER_01]: For the original Xbox, it is.

464
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:19,052
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, I think it could potentially get people into gaming again because it seems like...

465
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:33,233
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a single, I mean, I'm sure that there can be some recommendations, but there aren't a lot of mainstream ways to just completely reintroduce somebody into gaming who's used to the, you know, classic Nintendo, ah, God bless it, you know, two-button interface.

466
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:42,495
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think that the Wii is a great, you know, I think they ultimately could become more successful with more complicated gaming, etc.

467
00:26:42,815 --> 00:26:44,095
[SPEAKER_01]: But, Cooking Mama is fun.

468
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:46,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, not another one.

469
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:47,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooking Mama.

470
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:48,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

471
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:50,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm burnt out on it, though, I will admit.

472
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:52,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I want off this show.

473
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:58,791
[SPEAKER_09]: A very special listener sent me pictures of Mama cosplay, which you'll hear about later.

474
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:00,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I tell the Mama cosplayer?

475
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:03,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Go outside, please.

476
00:27:03,712 --> 00:27:04,292
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on my phone.

477
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll show you the Mama Con.

478
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:07,334
[SPEAKER_04]: You also need to go outside.

479
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:08,054
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

480
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:10,975
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to bite my ass, but to quote Chris in a non-little sense.

481
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:20,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have to complain, though, and this is really old-school gaming, but my friend told me to try to get into RPGs to try Morrowind, and I bought a video game to play, not to read.

482
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to walk every fucking where.

483
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:24,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to say that.

484
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,902
[SPEAKER_09]: However, here's a really awesome picture of me in a hat.

485
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:31,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever... Actually, speaking more, have you ever played Elder Scrolls Oblivion?

486
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:32,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever?

487
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's kind of an adventure game.

488
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:34,984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty as hell.

489
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:36,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to show it to you someday.

490
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:36,625
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't.

491
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:37,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very pretty.

492
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,446
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very... It's fun.

493
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:41,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't have an Xbox, but Chris has an Xbox, yes.

494
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:42,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for 360.

495
00:27:42,189 --> 00:27:44,410
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays black all the time.

496
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:46,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

497
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:47,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's doing that cosplay?

498
00:27:47,772 --> 00:27:48,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know?

499
00:27:48,593 --> 00:27:49,053
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

500
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:49,814
[SPEAKER_08]: It's some convention.

501
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:50,434
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

502
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:51,895
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

503
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:55,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is that something Rama sent you from the... Oh, my bad.

504
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:57,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I not supposed to spoil?

505
00:27:59,192 --> 00:27:59,692
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record.

506
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that look, Jamie.

507
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:03,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop pouting.

508
00:28:05,454 --> 00:28:06,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad Rob.

509
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:06,855
[SPEAKER_05]: So cute.

510
00:28:06,955 --> 00:28:07,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad Rob.

511
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:11,856
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then let's keep the show moving so we can get to some news and whatever it is Jamie's keeping secret.

512
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll show you movement, bowel movement.

513
00:28:14,117 --> 00:28:18,338
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow, let's get to some gaming news, thankfully.

514
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:20,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, yes, we need some gaming news here on this program.

515
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,580
[SPEAKER_04]: So who's going to start us off tonight?

516
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think.

517
00:28:23,795 --> 00:28:25,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, we actually talk about games once in a while.

518
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:26,337
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, get this.

519
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:27,117
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Chris?

520
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:28,838
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually get some exclusives.

521
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Things you haven't heard anywhere else yet.

522
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, really?

523
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:33,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

524
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:34,302
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

525
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:35,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's going to tell us.

526
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:36,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

527
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you all go back to whatever you were doing before?

528
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:41,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

529
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so...

530
00:28:45,386 --> 00:28:51,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Like last week how we had some exclusive dates for the Microsoft games, today we come with a brand new company, Midway.

531
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,350
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a whole lineup for their games.

532
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:58,873
[SPEAKER_11]: And the core subject of the change, you know, like a certain Halo 3 date, you know.

533
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:12,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I still believe that that game Oh yes, I forgot to mention, the Halo 3 official teaser came out this week And there it is right there, Fall 2007 And Loki had said on this show previously, what, April or May or something?

534
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:13,872
[SPEAKER_11]: May, but Wrong!

535
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:21,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's why, okay, and I have a couple reasons why I think they're doing this One, it's a big Christmas, you know, they don't have a big Christmas game coming out

536
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:27,966
[SPEAKER_11]: 2.

537
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:27,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they thought that the PlayStation 3 was going to be in a better position to, you know, where there might actually be a threat.

538
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:33,771
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, right now I don't see PlayStation 3s flying off the shelves, and they certainly don't have the lineup for it, so...

539
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:36,616
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need to put the game out right now.

540
00:29:36,956 --> 00:29:42,842
[SPEAKER_11]: And to be honest, I think the game will probably be done by May, but they'll just hold it until Christmas so they can capitalize on that stuff.

541
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:45,224
[SPEAKER_04]: So lesson learned about the distribution dates.

542
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've said it before.

543
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:48,507
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't anything we didn't tell you when we said the Halo 3 the first time.

544
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:49,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Dates are subject to change.

545
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:51,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Retailers push things back all the time.

546
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,951
[SPEAKER_04]: You read about this on blogs.

547
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:57,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can tell you how things are now, but unforeseen circumstances will push things back.

548
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,315
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

549
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:32,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, we'll be getting Hour of Victory on the Xbox 360, yet another World War II first-person shooter.

550
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:40,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Blacksite Area 51, also scheduled for September, September 12th, on PlayStation 3 and 360.

551
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:44,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, in September, Unreal Tournament 3 on the 360.

552
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,661
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the 19th.

553
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:51,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Mortal Kombat's coming out on the DS on October 17th.

554
00:30:51,304 --> 00:30:51,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

555
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:51,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

556
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:55,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they can.

557
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:58,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, has there ever been a good handheld Mortal Kombat?

558
00:30:58,331 --> 00:30:58,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever?

559
00:30:59,152 --> 00:30:59,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever?

560
00:30:59,913 --> 00:31:01,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, if you have a Nomad.

561
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:03,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I don't.

562
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:05,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a Nomad's just a Genesis.

563
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:07,202
[SPEAKER_04]: But you said handheld.

564
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:07,823
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cheating.

565
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:08,424
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

566
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:09,005
[SPEAKER_04]: You cheated.

567
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:10,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, um... You're a cheating cheater.

568
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Also scheduled the same date, Wheelman on PlayStation 3 and 360.

569
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:18,243
[SPEAKER_11]: That brand new Vin Diesel movie slash game.

570
00:31:18,763 --> 00:31:19,564
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be coming out.

571
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:21,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Some other interesting stuff from Nintendo.

572
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:25,506
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to have the official Nintendo headset for the DS coming out April 22nd.

573
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,707
[SPEAKER_11]: And a couple delays.

574
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:29,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, one delay here for you.

575
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:32,910
[SPEAKER_11]: MLB 07, the show for the PlayStation 3, has been delayed to April 24th.

576
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:33,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

577
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

578
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of dates.

579
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:38,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well thank you very much for those dates.

580
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking in the chatroom, Fireboma says Mortal Kombat better be Wi-Fi.

581
00:31:42,922 --> 00:31:43,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's the reason to have an idea.

582
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:44,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I should take Dark Resurrection.

583
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:45,623
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good point.

584
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:46,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Who said that?

585
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:48,224
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a good point.

586
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:54,507
[SPEAKER_11]: There was also Mortal Kombat Deceptions Unchained on the PSP that came out in November.

587
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so I think back to those crappy Game Boy ones.

588
00:31:58,628 --> 00:31:58,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

589
00:31:59,169 --> 00:31:59,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely you played...

590
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:00,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

591
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:25,900
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

592
00:32:55,187 --> 00:33:01,493
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you have, though, is there was a little teaser poster that just said Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2.

593
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:02,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really all we know.

594
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:05,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming, but that's a good sign.

595
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:07,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you surprised?

596
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,160
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, yes, because it's arcade.

597
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,303
[SPEAKER_04]: If this was a home version, no, that's not a surprise at all.

598
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:31,174
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as a arcade release goes, yeah, I think it is a little bit of a surprise because of the fact that DDR took such a long break, I think, to get a new game announced so quickly, despite the rumors of the 200, 300 song expansion, whatever it is, which is probably this, that, you know, I think it's great.

599
00:33:31,749 --> 00:33:34,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder what that says, because I can't read Japanese, obviously.

600
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:38,191
[SPEAKER_11]: So it says 2000, I wonder if it's like spring, fall, you know, summer.

601
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:42,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me give it a look, but I will do that after I deliver some other news to us.

602
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:50,776
[SPEAKER_11]: And why the hell does this look like, I want to say, like some crappy Pokemon logo or something.

603
00:33:51,456 --> 00:33:52,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the damn poster?

604
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:54,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Pokemon's very lame.

605
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:58,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris has problems with you calling Pokemon lame.

606
00:33:59,077 --> 00:34:04,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon is the only game that I really, truly loved first.

607
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:10,325
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, DDR Supernova 2, I think it's going to be a Jewish game if you notice there's almost like a Star of David in the background there.

608
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:12,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

609
00:34:12,406 --> 00:34:17,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Our resident Jew in the room has made a face in regards to that.

610
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Loki's married to a Jew, too, so he gets to make the jokes through proxy.

611
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:27,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

612
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:36,093
[SPEAKER_04]: He's into Judaism, if you know what I mean.

613
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:43,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Marissa's boyfriend is half Japanese with a very Japanese mother, so she gets to make all the Japanese jokes, so she's okay by proxy, too.

614
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:44,539
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

615
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:44,859
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

616
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

617
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I get to make Jewish jokes because I know you?

618
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:51,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it.

619
00:34:52,330 --> 00:35:01,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I do believe that that says, looking at that, that is, I want to say Winter.

620
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:05,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure that that's the kanji for 2007 Winter.

621
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:09,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Kyle Snyder's in chat, who's somewhat of a well-known DDR persona.

622
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:10,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Kyle!

623
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:13,156
[SPEAKER_04]: And he thinks the following will show up in Supernova 2.

624
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:15,077
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the official Kyle Snyder predictions.

625
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:21,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Fly Away Remix, Stargate Heaven, Future Love Mix, Flow, Jam & Reggae Mix, VJ Army, G2, and Outer Limits.

626
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:24,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't mind if DJ Ranma showed up.

627
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:25,619
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be rad.

628
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

629
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what else is absolutely, completely, 100% rad and even more super cool than DDR?

630
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:32,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Me.

631
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:33,926
Me!

632
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:35,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Your mom is cooler than DDR.

633
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:37,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is true because I like your mom.

634
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:38,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Your mom's really cool.

635
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:40,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

636
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,993
[SPEAKER_09]: But not in a, you know... Not in a homosexual way.

637
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:44,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Not in an MILF way.

638
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:44,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

639
00:35:45,755 --> 00:35:46,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

640
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:51,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but, uh, Silent Hill is coming to the arcade, and yes, I know, everybody already knows about it, so shut up.

641
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: There is... Orange Lounge Radio, reporting the news you already know about.

642
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:13,453
[SPEAKER_09]: There is, uh, Silent Hill, um, in development for the arcade, um, not really major, too much about it out, it's just called Silent Hill the Arcade, um, supposed to be a gun game with a big curtain around it, and... Ooh, Pyramid Head.

643
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:15,995
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um...

644
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:17,782
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks really blurry.

645
00:36:18,522 --> 00:36:21,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm thinking it's just going for the look of Silent Hill.

646
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:23,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's probably going to be foggy and have that whole ambience to it.

647
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, the PlayStation 2 looked better than that.

648
00:36:26,627 --> 00:36:27,447
[SPEAKER_04]: That curtain's got to go.

649
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:29,448
[SPEAKER_04]: That curtain isn't going to last.

650
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:31,750
[SPEAKER_04]: That curtain that's on the thing, though, yeah.

651
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:35,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Little kids at Golf Land will rip that shit off in five seconds.

652
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:41,495
[SPEAKER_09]: But my whole fear regarding this, though, is that it's going to turn and it's going to be like a House of the Dead clone and it better not be.

653
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:44,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I will personally go to Konami of Japan with a tank.

654
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:46,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I will tape that.

655
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:50,361
[SPEAKER_04]: If Akira Yamaoka has anything to do with this, I'm okay with it.

656
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:52,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know, I respect that man so much.

657
00:36:52,183 --> 00:36:55,945
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's really cool, I will personally, I mean, hug him.

658
00:36:57,987 --> 00:37:00,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa, you a big Silent Hill, you a Silent Hill fan?

659
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:02,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Chris, I'm not making it up to you.

660
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go see a lot of movies, not because I'm a hermit, because I don't like paying $8 and seeing a movie that sucks.

661
00:37:08,314 --> 00:37:11,616
[SPEAKER_01]: I drive my feet stick to the floor and smell a vomit or whatever else goes on in the theater.

662
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I haven't seen a lot of movies.

663
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:16,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like scary games?

664
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:18,568
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever thought about playing a scary video game?

665
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:23,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the best girlfriend in the world when I bought my boyfriend, who couldn't afford anything.

666
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought him a... Neither could I, technically.

667
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought him a GameCube and... Goddammit, I'm having a total... Eternal Darkness.

668
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:31,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

669
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:32,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Resident Evil 4.

670
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:35,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought him Resident Evil for the GameCube and he just had a heart attack.

671
00:37:35,411 --> 00:37:36,452
[SPEAKER_01]: This ain't a cutscene!

672
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:37,772
Resident Evil!

673
00:37:38,484 --> 00:37:39,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

674
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:43,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the suspenseful games, but sometimes they can just piss you off.

675
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:47,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And make you want to kill something, like in the game.

676
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:48,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Trauma Center.

677
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:50,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Trauma Center is amazing.

678
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:53,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Trauma Center makes you want to kill things.

679
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Stab your knife into the patient.

680
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:59,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I love, that's my favorite thing to do when I get frustrated in Trauma Centers.

681
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I just whip out the scalpel and go...

682
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:07,398
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I like to do in trauma center now that I'm in school to be a massage therapist?

683
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:08,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's begin the operation.

684
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I like tracing out their muscles because I know where they are now.

685
00:38:12,801 --> 00:38:14,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Blaze says trauma center equals love.

686
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:18,743
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, just because I'm proud of myself, I made a 92 on my anatomy test.

687
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:20,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

688
00:38:20,604 --> 00:38:21,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to games.

689
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:24,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, can I get some technical geek on?

690
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:25,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a SM58?

691
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:25,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have...

692
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:29,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea.

693
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:32,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally know how to relax the piriformis when you have sciatic pain.

694
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:37,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Silent Hill, when does this come out?

695
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:38,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know?

696
00:38:39,547 --> 00:38:42,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I did know, and then I closed the article.

697
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:44,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me down.

698
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:46,549
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

699
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:48,909
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they don't actually say.

700
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:51,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope the curtain was just to protect...

701
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:54,948
[SPEAKER_04]: The Press at this arcade show because that curtain is so ugly.

702
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:57,209
[SPEAKER_09]: It would only be in America that the curtain would be in anything.

703
00:38:57,249 --> 00:39:01,030
[SPEAKER_11]: The curtain was basically to give it a dark, eerie feeling.

704
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,891
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the reasoning for the curtain is.

705
00:39:02,911 --> 00:39:05,892
[SPEAKER_04]: The curtain gives you the feeling of playing it in a hefty bag.

706
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:08,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the curtain gives you the feeling of.

707
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:08,893
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

708
00:39:08,953 --> 00:39:14,075
[SPEAKER_09]: If they want to really make it a thing, they should do it like how that crap-tastic Jurassic Park game is.

709
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:16,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you can sit down.

710
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:19,677
[SPEAKER_04]: All I want to do is...

711
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:27,278
[SPEAKER_04]: If they come out with the typing of the Silent Hill... No, it would be Silent Hill the typing.

712
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:34,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I will retire from video game everything because everything I need in the world has been done.

713
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:36,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I still play Typing of the Dead.

714
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,129
[SPEAKER_11]: What if it were like Guitar Freaks crossed with Silent Hill?

715
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:40,990
[SPEAKER_11]: That's stupid.

716
00:39:42,951 --> 00:39:43,792
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be keytar.

717
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:45,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Pyramid Head rocks out.

718
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,296
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you have to fight them with the power of rock.

719
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,612
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it would be, it would, I got it, I got it.

720
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:52,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Guitaruman gone lame.

721
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:54,574
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it'd be, we should have SilentKitar.

722
00:39:58,677 --> 00:39:59,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Cassio the Shooting!

723
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:02,260
[SPEAKER_09]: You can kill them with hollow notes, okay?

724
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,581
That's what you can do.

725
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:05,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of... Dude, you can kill anyone with hollow notes.

726
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:10,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of... If you really want to go for the murder, sorry.

727
00:40:10,566 --> 00:40:12,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of slightly lame, let's talk about Tekken 6.

728
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:15,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Tekken 6 is slightly lame.

729
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:16,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

730
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:19,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the screenshots and the trailer that they've shown of it look kind of lame.

731
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:23,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And not even really up to par to Virtua Fighter 5.

732
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:27,243
[SPEAKER_11]: But nonetheless, we'll be coming to arcades soon.

733
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:31,665
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll be featuring also two new characters, Leo and Zafina.

734
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:35,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Both which look very generic.

735
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,068
[SPEAKER_11]: So, hooray.

736
00:40:37,428 --> 00:40:42,411
[SPEAKER_11]: But it looks like it will have the same visual quality of Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection...

737
00:40:43,426 --> 00:40:47,868
[SPEAKER_04]: and, um... Okay, um, wait, wait, what were the characters' names again?

738
00:40:47,908 --> 00:40:48,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Leo?

739
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:49,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Leo and Zafina.

740
00:40:49,669 --> 00:40:56,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now keep in mind, I've never seen pictures of these characters, I don't even know if they've leaked out, but I'm gonna make some bold predictions, okay, knowing the Tekken series.

741
00:40:56,411 --> 00:41:02,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna say Leo is shirtless, and Jamina, or whatever her name, Jamigla?

742
00:41:02,354 --> 00:41:02,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Zafina.

743
00:41:02,954 --> 00:41:03,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Zafina?

744
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:04,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Serafina?

745
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:09,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Serafina has humongous breasts that will bounce.

746
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:09,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

747
00:41:10,712 --> 00:41:14,273
[SPEAKER_11]: You're wrong about shirtless.

748
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:15,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Every character in Tekken is shirtless.

749
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:17,854
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

750
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:19,855
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been one of the chicks, I think.

751
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:29,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Leo looks like a chick, who also looks like someone that was ripped from Final Fantasy X. No, Leo looks like one of the Bogards, a little bit.

752
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:31,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Leo looks like a chick.

753
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, and then... That's a guy.

754
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,480
[SPEAKER_11]: And then...

755
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:36,725
[SPEAKER_11]: and Zafina.

756
00:41:37,326 --> 00:41:46,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Zafina, well, she's your chick that's, you know, of course she has big boobs, but she's your... One out of two ain't bad.

757
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:46,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Your ethnic chick.

758
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,851
[SPEAKER_04]: What, is she a belly dancer?

759
00:41:47,891 --> 00:41:48,551
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is that?

760
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:48,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

761
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:49,812
[SPEAKER_04]: She's wearing a sarong.

762
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:50,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

763
00:41:52,153 --> 00:41:54,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, easy access, I suppose.

764
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:56,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Either way, it looks kind of neat.

765
00:41:56,695 --> 00:42:02,258
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to have... It looks like from the trailer, they're going to have different ways you can kind of build up your characters.

766
00:42:03,986 --> 00:42:08,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it looks okay, but do you really need to push better graphics with fighting games?

767
00:42:08,448 --> 00:42:09,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Just make it fun.

768
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:09,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

769
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:10,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm yay for that, actually.

770
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa says she's yay for that.

771
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:21,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Although they do need to push more boob physics with Dead or Alive 3, or Dead or Alive 5, I guess it would be.

772
00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:22,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you're a Tekken fan girl.

773
00:42:23,016 --> 00:42:27,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited about Tekken 6, or is this a little too much of one thing, or what?

774
00:42:27,697 --> 00:42:31,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always excited over anything that has gin in it.

775
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, as long as gin's in it, right?

776
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:39,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And Asuka now, because Asuka's kind of... Wait here, I'm going to write a letter on Jamie's behalf to Namco.

777
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:43,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Namco... May I?

778
00:42:43,888 --> 00:42:44,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Namco Bondi.

779
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit down, shut up, let me speak.

780
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

781
00:42:49,271 --> 00:42:50,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you talk too much.

782
00:42:50,252 --> 00:42:51,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear... I know.

783
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:53,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Even our fans think so, too.

784
00:42:53,454 --> 00:42:54,155
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know, it's fine.

785
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:54,455
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what...

786
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:56,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then here's my letter.

787
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:57,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear fans, suck it.

788
00:42:57,568 --> 00:42:58,469
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

789
00:42:58,489 --> 00:42:59,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to Jamie's letter.

790
00:42:59,250 --> 00:42:59,990
[SPEAKER_09]: That's G4.

791
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:06,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Namco Bandai, Jin!

792
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:07,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, Jin!

793
00:43:07,657 --> 00:43:08,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, oh my god!

794
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,459
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, no.

795
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:10,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Love, Jamie.

796
00:43:12,942 --> 00:43:16,545
[SPEAKER_09]: My obsession has also carried over to Asuka.

797
00:43:17,706 --> 00:43:18,086
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

798
00:43:18,527 --> 00:43:19,147
Asuka!

799
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,268
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

800
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:20,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, boobs.

801
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike W says, my ears bleed.

802
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:25,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Rondo of Blood, the fighting game.

803
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireboma says, write it in blood.

804
00:43:29,212 --> 00:43:31,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Uni says, I'm going to smack Rob for not being nice to DS.

805
00:43:32,252 --> 00:43:32,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I bite back.

806
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:37,974
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, I'm so sick of how many shadows your game can fucking render if it still sucks.

807
00:43:39,694 --> 00:43:40,374
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record.

808
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:44,835
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we feel, but we don't know how to put it so eloquently to the developers.

809
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:47,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to write a letter to the developers of games?

810
00:43:47,396 --> 00:43:48,216
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I went like that?

811
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:48,816
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

812
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:55,058
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, great, now you have a really shiny, highly rendered piece of shit instead of just, you know.

813
00:43:56,018 --> 00:43:58,179
[SPEAKER_04]: That dookie looks mighty fine.

814
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can see, like, it's obvious you ate corn.

815
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,321
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, wow, she looks really lifelike.

816
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:11,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad that she clips through people and is stuck in the stage or something.

817
00:44:11,243 --> 00:44:15,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Blood Elves in World of Warcraft because they, like, levitate over bridges because the clipping is so awful.

818
00:44:15,884 --> 00:44:17,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's

819
00:44:18,432 --> 00:44:19,573
[SPEAKER_04]: In certain places they do.

820
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:20,314
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.

821
00:44:20,554 --> 00:44:21,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

822
00:44:21,515 --> 00:44:23,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about something very sexy.

823
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides me.

824
00:44:26,058 --> 00:44:28,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Ikaruga is a shooter game.

825
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,261
[SPEAKER_04]: You know Ikaruga, right?

826
00:44:30,341 --> 00:44:32,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the one where you... Radiant Silvergun, the sequel.

827
00:44:32,943 --> 00:44:38,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you press buttons to change the color of your shield because there's like red bullets and I think it was purple bullets and red bullets.

828
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:42,090
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like black and white, but the black is kind of purplish.

829
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:42,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so awesome.

830
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,173
[SPEAKER_04]: You have these bullets and you change the shield color.

831
00:44:45,193 --> 00:44:46,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a great shooter.

832
00:44:46,073 --> 00:44:46,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

833
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:48,753
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX 360 DEBUG UNIT PARTNER NET

834
00:45:14,474 --> 00:45:43,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Icaruga that is just like so well I'll tell you something else though that's relatively sexy that is if you are a big collector like me and um a skew has shown up at GameCrazy which I cannot confirm for my husband's GameCrazy because he hasn't seen fit to tell me sorry for a black Xbox 360 and it has been confirmed by several GameCrazy's isn't this like the fourth week in a row there's been some type of black Xbox 360 story on the internet

835
00:45:43,837 --> 00:45:44,737
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, why?

836
00:45:44,757 --> 00:45:45,978
[SPEAKER_11]: The original Xbox was black.

837
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:46,979
[SPEAKER_11]: But we had the Halo one.

838
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:14,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but here's the thing, though, about it.

839
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:17,040
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's not really the fact that it's black.

840
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,940
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that it's going to have a 128-gig hard drive, supposedly, and they think that's also going to have an HDMI out.

841
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:25,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you right now... And a bigger penis.

842
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:29,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you right now, either way, it's just going to be a disappointment.

843
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:32,542
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all it's going to be is a big disappointment for you.

844
00:46:33,102 --> 00:46:34,123
[SPEAKER_11]: So, great.

845
00:46:34,143 --> 00:46:34,903
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to announce that.

846
00:46:34,943 --> 00:46:40,484
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to announce a 512 card or a memory unit or whatever, and everybody's like, Oh, yay!

847
00:46:40,524 --> 00:46:42,664
[SPEAKER_11]: We can download more crap.

848
00:46:42,684 --> 00:46:42,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

849
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:51,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I just had to weigh in on this subject because I think Nintendo, it's the stupidest thing in the world, but I think they made a big mistake with the GameCube.

850
00:46:51,964 --> 00:46:54,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got my ex the GameCube, but they made it purple.

851
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:57,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Because guys were afraid of having a purple GameCube.

852
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:00,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, be glad that we didn't get the orange one.

853
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:01,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Mine was silver.

854
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:03,935
[SPEAKER_12]: It was indigo, okay?

855
00:47:05,316 --> 00:47:07,978
[SPEAKER_11]: It was blue, and by the way, I had the black ones.

856
00:47:08,018 --> 00:47:08,959
[SPEAKER_08]: In Japan they had orange ones.

857
00:47:08,979 --> 00:47:09,880
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes you extra hetero.

858
00:47:10,768 --> 00:47:14,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw says, Sky, you know that old saying, once you go black, you never go back.

859
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:16,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true, DarkSakura?

860
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that why you need the black Xbox 360 so bad?

861
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:20,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I want it to match my Saturn.

862
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:22,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Among other things.

863
00:47:22,852 --> 00:47:32,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing, though, about, you know, you're going to get this nice, fancy, black Xbox 360, and then, oh, wait, the controllers are white, the Xbox HD, you know, DVD player is white.

864
00:47:33,215 --> 00:47:35,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, the remote's white.

865
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:40,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't give two shits, maybe half of one, but, you know, it's...

866
00:47:41,616 --> 00:47:47,633
[SPEAKER_09]: For people who say, you know, fine, you've got a new one, but whatever.

867
00:47:48,637 --> 00:47:53,800
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the record, the Sega Saturn did initially come out in white in Japan.

868
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Check your sources!

869
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:59,203
[SPEAKER_04]: James Patrick asks in chat, DarkSakura should sell the Halo one.

870
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:00,684
[SPEAKER_04]: They're worth a bit of money now.

871
00:48:00,784 --> 00:48:01,365
[SPEAKER_09]: The fuck I will.

872
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:02,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

873
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:04,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Halo one as well.

874
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:05,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I sell it?

875
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:07,528
[SPEAKER_04]: What would I play my Xbox games on?

876
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:13,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind, if I sell my Xbox, that drops me down to 42 video game systems.

877
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an orange one.

878
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:16,954
[SPEAKER_04]: But 42 is the answer to everything.

879
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:22,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming Nerd says, I'd love a nice pink 360 to match my pink PS2.

880
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,692
[SPEAKER_04]: In related news, Gaming Nerd is my favorite chatter ever.

881
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:36,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, when I replace my JPS2, I'm going to get the Sakura PS2, which is sort of a purpley color.

882
00:48:38,238 --> 00:48:39,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the Sakura one, so it's mine!

883
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine.

884
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:42,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Mine.

885
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:45,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I do, I have my own brand of condoms.

886
00:48:45,615 --> 00:48:47,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of partner, Nat, a little bit.

887
00:48:47,297 --> 00:48:49,740
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

888
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she say that in a mic?

889
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:51,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

890
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:55,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I've got to tell you this.

891
00:48:55,587 --> 00:48:57,289
[SPEAKER_04]: This is completely off the subject, but I've got to say it.

892
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my own brand of condoms!

893
00:48:59,642 --> 00:48:59,742
[SPEAKER_04]: What?!

894
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:00,462
[SPEAKER_04]: No, pass the mic to Chris.

895
00:49:22,528 --> 00:49:27,611
[SPEAKER_06]: We were, uh, Jamie and I, when we hang out, we go down to Japan Town, and we go to, uh, Ichiban Con.

896
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:28,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Ichiban Con.

897
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:29,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Ichiban Con, thank you.

898
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:33,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, they've got a bunch of imports from Japan, and one time we found Sakura condoms.

899
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:35,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Jamie, look, your condoms!

900
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,717
[SPEAKER_09]: And Chris said that, and I repeated what she said, only I had the mic in my hand.

901
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:39,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, see?

902
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,698
[SPEAKER_09]: So that wasn't random, you just weren't paying attention.

903
00:49:41,718 --> 00:49:42,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a bad host!

904
00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:43,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

905
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:44,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad host.

906
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, whatever.

907
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:47,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are Sakura brand, those are not dark.

908
00:49:47,782 --> 00:49:48,982
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one third of your show, too.

909
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:50,343
[SPEAKER_09]: But they were in a dark box.

910
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:52,962
[SPEAKER_11]: That does not count.

911
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:53,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it does.

912
00:49:54,062 --> 00:49:55,663
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just like saying, okay.

913
00:49:56,964 --> 00:49:59,946
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be just like saying, oh, the Whitman chocolates out there.

914
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:03,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, they must be my brand chocolates because it's very close to my last name, White Man.

915
00:50:03,788 --> 00:50:05,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Or that's like saying, go outside and look up.

916
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's me, Sky.

917
00:50:09,692 --> 00:50:10,373
[SPEAKER_09]: You could do that.

918
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

919
00:50:13,194 --> 00:50:15,956
[SPEAKER_09]: That also put you in the category of I invented the internet.

920
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I am everywhere.

921
00:50:19,461 --> 00:50:20,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Loki, you had something you wanted to say.

922
00:50:20,982 --> 00:50:21,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you finished?

923
00:50:21,442 --> 00:50:22,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're finished.

924
00:50:22,242 --> 00:50:22,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

925
00:50:23,463 --> 00:50:24,623
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's talk about PartnerNet.

926
00:50:24,663 --> 00:50:32,847
[SPEAKER_11]: PartnerNet's been around forever, and I guess everybody forgot their NDAs regarding PartnerNet because you do not talk about PartnerNet.

927
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:34,347
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the first rule of PartnerNet.

928
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:38,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

929
00:50:38,729 --> 00:50:42,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone I know who's ever had PartnerNet, which isn't us because we're not cool enough,

930
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,897
[SPEAKER_04]: They blab PartnerNet.

931
00:50:45,957 --> 00:50:49,319
[SPEAKER_04]: We know enough that you don't post it on blogs and things, but oh god.

932
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,540
[SPEAKER_04]: People who have PartnerNet don't shut up.

933
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,022
[SPEAKER_11]: They think they're special.

934
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:59,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone took some video of it and they found out about more games coming out.

935
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:01,726
[SPEAKER_11]: None of which I'm too surprised about.

936
00:51:01,786 --> 00:51:02,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of these have already been announced.

937
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:05,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Rare's Jetpack, a game that's coming out later on.

938
00:51:05,968 --> 00:51:06,789
[SPEAKER_11]: They've already announced that.

939
00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:08,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Juice 2007, already been announced.

940
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolute, who the hell knows what that is.

941
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:12,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Ob's Pinball, yay.

942
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:13,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Two Pinball.

943
00:51:14,297 --> 00:51:20,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Tetris Online, which I think might actually be that Tetris Evolution or whatever that's coming out in March, whatever.

944
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe another downloadable game.

945
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:24,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, two different Tetrises.

946
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:27,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And then some Halo 2 maps that were already announced.

947
00:51:27,822 --> 00:51:30,463
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, very exciting.

948
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:33,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

949
00:51:33,504 --> 00:51:33,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

950
00:51:34,184 --> 00:51:35,325
[SPEAKER_11]: More stuff coming out.

951
00:51:35,465 --> 00:51:36,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, you can't talk about it, though.

952
00:51:37,085 --> 00:51:38,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Although there are other websites.

953
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:41,647
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was reading some comments that they were posting about

954
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:42,889
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

955
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:46,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, apparently one of the bigger sites that had a movie got asked to take it down.

956
00:51:46,692 --> 00:51:47,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, snap.

957
00:51:47,092 --> 00:51:47,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

958
00:52:07,762 --> 00:52:08,282
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX REWARDS CHALLENGE

959
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:42,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox's little concession for this whole thing is that they have extended the Xbox reward challenge by three days.

960
00:52:42,558 --> 00:52:45,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have three whole more days to extend your gamer score by 1,500 points.

961
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:59,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are bitching and complaining because they were like, dude, I took the day off of work so I could be the first to inflate my gamer score so I could make sure that I'm one of the ones that gets this game because you only said so many copies would be out there.

962
00:52:59,668 --> 00:53:05,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm saying if this is you, my personal opinion of you is that you need to go out and get a fucking life because seriously?

963
00:53:06,328 --> 00:53:12,231
[SPEAKER_04]: If you took a day off of work to stay home and increase your gamerscore for this competition, Microsoft does not owe you anything.

964
00:53:13,032 --> 00:53:14,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft made the game.

965
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:16,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft made the system.

966
00:53:16,474 --> 00:53:17,395
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what you bought.

967
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,637
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole rewards thing is like somebody giving you something for free.

968
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:23,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft did not owe you this.

969
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you so mad over this?

970
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,601
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I refuse to get mad about this.

971
00:53:27,681 --> 00:53:30,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, it was a little frustrating because I tried to go on the site, but it's like, you know what?

972
00:53:30,363 --> 00:53:31,503
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free stuff.

973
00:53:31,664 --> 00:53:36,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Quit your bitching and get like one of those diamond cards for free and then go get discounts at other places.

974
00:53:36,306 --> 00:53:42,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Or go get a whore and have sex and get some of that energy out of your system because seriously, if you're getting that

975
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:42,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

976
00:53:56,914 --> 00:54:24,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure people know that Fuse and Frenzy 2 is not even worth it so I can think of no other reason why people want to do this other than to say look at my giant internet cock I got the free game in the Microsoft contest and let me be the first to tell you it's just like you got into the Halo 3 beta fucking everyone got into the Halo 3 beta who cares my girlfriend's cock is bigger than yours it is

977
00:54:25,956 --> 00:54:26,477
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, though?

978
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:36,801
[SPEAKER_01]: If I went to somebody's house and they have that on display, that's not unlike... Well, I have a friend that owns a magic card shop and they show me those player cards, you know, with the pictures of the expert magic player.

979
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:39,322
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a guide of who not to have sex with.

980
00:54:42,884 --> 00:54:44,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, it is.

981
00:54:45,505 --> 00:54:45,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway...

982
00:54:48,153 --> 00:54:55,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think Marissa, I see Marissa speaking for, like, the girls who are, like, kind of just not really associated with video games.

983
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:57,715
[SPEAKER_06]: She's, like, from the outside, oh, okay, well, DS is cool.

984
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:05,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, so she comes in and sees, you know, a bunch of people freaking out over video games, and she goes, wow, I'm not fucking them.

985
00:55:06,217 --> 00:55:11,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, who gives a crap if, you know, they don't want to have, or they're not going to get, you know, laid by a girl.

986
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:16,400
[SPEAKER_11]: That cuts into precious time that they could be earning more gamerscore points.

987
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:16,820
Oh, no.

988
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,784
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, okay, everyone I've dated has been a nerd, okay?

989
00:55:20,804 --> 00:55:27,132
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all on the record if anyone out there knows Kaylee, and that's just Kaylee, the big anime music video editor.

990
00:55:27,172 --> 00:55:28,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've put in my time.

991
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:30,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a music nerd, okay?

992
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,377
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have to say about that.

993
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:34,021
[SPEAKER_04]: She's showing her creds.

994
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:36,304
[SPEAKER_04]: She's literally whipping out her...

995
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:40,713
[SPEAKER_04]: She's whipping out her cock and putting it on the table going, look.

996
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:44,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent every day at school lunch in the library, okay?

997
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:45,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I put in my nerd time.

998
00:55:45,874 --> 00:55:47,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I have put in my time.

999
00:55:48,715 --> 00:55:48,995
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1000
00:55:51,335 --> 00:55:51,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1001
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:52,076
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1002
00:55:52,096 --> 00:55:54,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, that's all I have to say on the Xbox Rewards program.

1003
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:55,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for the little rant.

1004
00:55:56,197 --> 00:55:57,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?

1005
00:55:57,157 --> 00:55:58,077
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty shitty.

1006
00:55:58,237 --> 00:56:02,178
[SPEAKER_09]: However, speaking of Microsoft and shitty, but not in a... Okay.

1007
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:05,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say Microsoft and shitty, but, like, not shitty.

1008
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:06,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1009
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:10,096
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been discussing Forza 2 lately.

1010
00:56:10,136 --> 00:56:12,360
[SPEAKER_09]: The release date is in May in the United States.

1011
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:19,350
[SPEAKER_09]: It has been confirmed that it will be released in the UK in May this year.

1012
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:19,931
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1013
00:56:21,866 --> 00:56:25,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to give a little bit of background on that, there are going to be a lot of different cars in this.

1014
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:31,134
[SPEAKER_09]: There are 15 Ferraris, 2 Maseratis, 5 Lamborghinis, 13 Porsches.

1015
00:56:34,217 --> 00:56:35,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much a lot of good stuff.

1016
00:56:35,538 --> 00:56:39,281
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually going to have the 1987 Porsche 959 in there, so that's pretty cool.

1017
00:56:39,962 --> 00:56:43,685
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's looking like a pretty cool racing game if you're into that sort of thing.

1018
00:56:43,925 --> 00:56:48,309
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will, again, have a May release in the UK as well as in the US.

1019
00:56:48,669 --> 00:56:49,550
[SPEAKER_09]: The PAL version, sorry.

1020
00:56:51,337 --> 00:56:52,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that nice?

1021
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:54,704
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.

1022
00:56:55,987 --> 00:57:00,557
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, we're getting a lot more releases over here as well, not just

1023
00:57:01,035 --> 00:57:03,416
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Forza 2, which still weighs off.

1024
00:57:03,656 --> 00:57:07,618
[SPEAKER_11]: This week, though, we've got some good stuff, including brand new Wii games.

1025
00:57:08,278 --> 00:57:17,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic and the Secret Rings is going to be finally heading over to us, so hopefully that one won't suck as bad as... I don't know much about this Sonic, but will it redeem the series?

1026
00:57:18,163 --> 00:57:22,345
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks, to be honest, it looks just like the older Sonic games.

1027
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:25,226
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that this will actually be...

1028
00:57:25,786 --> 00:57:26,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty decent.

1029
00:57:26,807 --> 00:57:38,940
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played it, though, so I can't say the control issues are going to still be there, even with the Wii being a brand new system and stuff and new control sets.

1030
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:41,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope.

1031
00:57:41,373 --> 00:57:41,633
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope.

1032
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:45,095
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like it has some party games in it that are pretty fun, so hopefully.

1033
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:50,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Other stuff coming out, though, we're going to have Virtua Fighter 5 on the PlayStation 3.

1034
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,742
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be coming out this week, which is pretty awesome.

1035
00:57:53,942 --> 00:57:59,326
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 360, the game I've been playing, and you've got to pick it up, Crackdown, as well.

1036
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:03,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Also on the 360, there's going to be NBA Street Homecourt.

1037
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:05,050
[SPEAKER_11]: That one's going to be pretty awesome.

1038
00:58:06,006 --> 00:58:12,908
[SPEAKER_11]: on the PlayStation 2 Arena Football 2 Road to Glory, if you're into that alternative type of game.

1039
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:20,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Then, of course, on the PC here, we've got, what was it, Supreme Commander.

1040
00:58:21,591 --> 00:58:22,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see here.

1041
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:24,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Supreme Commander on PC.

1042
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:29,733
[SPEAKER_11]: On the PlayStation 3 download service, Flow is supposed to finally make its way on the 22nd.

1043
00:58:29,753 --> 00:58:30,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see here.

1044
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:38,346
[SPEAKER_11]: On the DS, Azuna, Legend of the Unemployed Ninja, which should be pretty interesting.

1045
00:58:39,106 --> 00:58:41,948
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also on PC, Warfront Turning Point.

1046
00:58:43,569 --> 00:58:49,172
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, that's about it as far as the good stuff.

1047
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:55,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, moving on over to Japan, where the video games come from a lot of times.

1048
00:58:56,746 --> 00:59:01,387
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, you know, especially when it comes to Xbox 360, the US kind of gets them first usually.

1049
00:59:01,687 --> 00:59:06,688
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks like they're doing a simultaneous release with Riot Act, which is what they're going to call Crackdown over in Japan.

1050
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:09,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Riot Act is coming out this week over in Japan.

1051
00:59:09,928 --> 00:59:14,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent also gets a release on the 22nd of February this week in Japan.

1052
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:20,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Spike is putting out, not the same, like Spike TV here, it's a different company.

1053
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:25,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Untold Legends Dark Kingdom makes its way to Japan on the PlayStation 3.

1054
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:29,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii Fire Emblem for the Wii.

1055
00:59:29,536 --> 00:59:30,597
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be really interesting.

1056
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:35,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Naruto Shippuden, Gekito Ninja Taisen.

1057
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:36,739
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be interesting.

1058
00:59:36,899 --> 00:59:38,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on February 22nd.

1059
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the PlayStation 2, you get a whole lot of stuff over in Japan.

1060
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:46,542
[SPEAKER_04]: What I thought was interesting, though, is that they're getting Destroy All Humans on the PlayStation 2.

1061
00:59:46,662 --> 00:59:50,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So, a game that was popular enough over here made its way over to Japan, so...

1062
00:59:51,868 --> 00:59:52,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Lupin the Third.

1063
00:59:52,628 --> 00:59:54,849
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Lupin 3 coming out in Japan.

1064
00:59:54,869 --> 00:59:56,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Lupin the Third.

1065
00:59:56,729 --> 00:59:58,690
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole shitload of stuff on the PlayStation 2 this week.

1066
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Pachislot, like if you like pachinko and that kind of stuff, you get that as well.

1067
01:00:03,691 --> 01:00:04,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1068
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:05,911
[SPEAKER_04]: The Prince of Tennis, Card Hunter.

1069
01:00:06,692 --> 01:00:08,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Prince of Tennis is actually kind of a fun anime.

1070
01:00:09,832 --> 01:00:10,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1071
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:11,032
[SPEAKER_04]: What about some other systems?

1072
01:00:11,052 --> 01:00:12,433
[SPEAKER_04]: How about on the Nintendo DS?

1073
01:00:12,873 --> 01:00:15,994
[SPEAKER_04]: You get Cats in Japan comes out.

1074
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:17,554
[SPEAKER_04]: SimCity DS as well.

1075
01:00:18,067 --> 01:00:21,649
[SPEAKER_04]: and one of my favorite titles, although, oh, that's actually a US release date.

1076
01:00:21,709 --> 01:00:22,889
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't name this one, though, did you?

1077
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Izuna, Legend of the Unemployed Ninja.

1078
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:26,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did you?

1079
01:00:26,311 --> 01:00:26,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1080
01:00:27,632 --> 01:00:29,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I was out of the room for a second.

1081
01:00:29,232 --> 01:00:31,614
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite name of the week, and it's not even a Japanese game.

1082
01:00:33,534 --> 01:00:34,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me check PSP.

1083
01:00:35,095 --> 01:00:38,357
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's about this ninja who goes around doing, like, odd jobs and stuff.

1084
01:00:40,078 --> 01:00:46,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Over on the PSP, you get the Metal Slug Complete Collection in Japan, Monster Hunter Portable, and...

1085
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:52,196
[SPEAKER_04]: and Boku wa Koku Kansai-ken, Airport Hero.

1086
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:53,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I am something.

1087
01:00:55,257 --> 01:00:56,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Airport Hero.

1088
01:00:56,997 --> 01:00:57,717
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1089
01:00:58,558 --> 01:01:04,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if the other one was already taken by the U.S., then I'm going to name that my favorite title of the week.

1090
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:05,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Airport Hero.

1091
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:08,360
[SPEAKER_09]: We should just get another Densha Dego.

1092
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,201
[SPEAKER_09]: It came with a controller so you could pilot a train.

1093
01:01:12,748 --> 01:01:18,712
[SPEAKER_04]: My Airport Hero is a screening line that can actually move at a steady pace.

1094
01:01:18,792 --> 01:01:23,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of backing up, I have to wait 45 minutes to take my belt off to go through the x-ray.

1095
01:01:23,736 --> 01:01:24,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Rob.

1096
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:24,577
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1097
01:01:25,217 --> 01:01:26,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we done with Japan?

1098
01:01:26,078 --> 01:01:26,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I'm done.

1099
01:01:26,718 --> 01:01:27,819
[SPEAKER_09]: We have other countries!

1100
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:28,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1101
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1102
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:34,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our UK release date.

1103
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:37,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I always thought Canada was the 51st state.

1104
01:01:40,008 --> 01:01:40,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

1105
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:41,129
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1106
01:01:41,389 --> 01:01:41,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1107
01:01:42,082 --> 01:01:42,242
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1108
01:01:42,662 --> 01:01:43,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Puerto Rico?

1109
01:01:43,303 --> 01:01:44,023
[SPEAKER_04]: What's Puerto Rico?

1110
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:44,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of it.

1111
01:01:45,023 --> 01:01:45,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

1112
01:01:45,523 --> 01:01:46,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, that's Ricky Martin's hometown.

1113
01:01:46,864 --> 01:01:48,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1114
01:01:48,725 --> 01:01:48,985
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1115
01:01:50,746 --> 01:01:51,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1116
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:51,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1117
01:01:52,366 --> 01:01:52,646
[SPEAKER_03]: UK.

1118
01:01:53,387 --> 01:01:54,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, UK.

1119
01:01:55,168 --> 01:01:59,029
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 22nd on the PlayStation 3, we have Qbert.

1120
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is funny because I have Qbert on the Atari 5200.

1121
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,731
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Clique Vision.

1122
01:02:03,811 --> 01:02:06,432
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 23rd, 23, the number of coincidence.

1123
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:09,173
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Blitz the League on Xbox 360.

1124
01:02:09,253 --> 01:02:10,414
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Crackdown...

1125
01:02:11,147 --> 01:02:34,923
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Disney's Chicken Little Ace in action on the Wii Final Fantasy XII, which, shit, took forever Ghost Rider on PlayStation 2 and PSP Guilty Gear Dust Strikers on DS I love Guilty Gear Infernal on PC Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas on PSP and Hot Pixel on the 25th on PSP And that's it!

1126
01:02:35,883 --> 01:02:39,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, actually, on the 27th there's also Flipper Critters and Jade Empire but that's next week

1127
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Pixel was that one PSP game that's kind of like WarioWare, right?

1128
01:02:43,402 --> 01:02:46,344
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not coming out until August here, I think.

1129
01:02:46,524 --> 01:02:46,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1130
01:02:46,744 --> 01:02:48,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask if it ever came out.

1131
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, our UK friends get games first.

1132
01:02:50,106 --> 01:02:50,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that's a first.

1133
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:51,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

1134
01:02:51,487 --> 01:02:52,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, UK.

1135
01:02:52,847 --> 01:02:53,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Way to go.

1136
01:02:53,488 --> 01:02:54,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad the game didn't look that good.

1137
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:57,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad the guy's kind of crazy.

1138
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,271
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like this old dude.

1139
01:02:58,291 --> 01:02:58,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

1140
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:00,832
[SPEAKER_04]: He was talking to us, and he was kind of creepy.

1141
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:04,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I got his card, but I felt like... Well, he's not going to come on the show now.

1142
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:05,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1143
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:07,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I just called him creepy.

1144
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,817
[SPEAKER_11]: He has his own podcast, by the way.

1145
01:03:08,937 --> 01:03:09,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he?

1146
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:10,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it's creepy.

1147
01:03:11,393 --> 01:03:21,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so apparently in the UK there's this wonderful show called Watchdog that they investigate

1148
01:03:21,886 --> 01:03:35,318
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, companies and stuff like that that have, you know, either defective products or, you know, they're... It's kind of like, I want to say there was something like this on Dateline or something where they investigate different businesses to make sure that they're up to par or whatever.

1149
01:03:35,759 --> 01:03:44,367
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're investigating Microsoft about the Xbox 360 because apparently they're saying that they have received 248 complaints about faulty Xbox 360s.

1150
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:44,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1151
01:03:49,893 --> 01:04:09,672
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're saying that the return rate was larger than Microsoft initially said and that the fact that the owners had to spend, or some of the owners had to spend around 80 pounds or about $156 to fix each of the units that just so happened to break after a year of purchasing the system.

1152
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:13,716
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, at the same time, I just...

1153
01:04:14,928 --> 01:04:16,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Aren't they a little late on this?

1154
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:20,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't this whole Defective 360 story about a year ago?

1155
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:22,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1156
01:04:22,595 --> 01:04:24,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes time to build these cases, though, don't forget.

1157
01:04:24,837 --> 01:04:28,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is the UK, and everything's delayed, unfortunately, with them.

1158
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:42,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so Microsoft, of course, responded saying that the claims made by the show are false, that the return rate of the Xbox 360 is significantly lower than the CE industry average of 3-5%.

1159
01:04:43,939 --> 01:04:49,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Customer satisfaction is our highest priority, and we do everything that we can to take care of the gamers who may have problems with their consoles.

1160
01:04:50,063 --> 01:04:55,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody having an issue with their 360 should call customer service immediately so that we can help.

1161
01:04:55,947 --> 01:05:03,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, to be honest, though, they did increase their warranty period for the 360, and I don't know, I think they're doing their part.

1162
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:07,914
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I would say, how are these 360s being broken?

1163
01:05:07,974 --> 01:05:09,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if it's people, you know,

1164
01:05:10,497 --> 01:05:21,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I still hear my customers talking about, oh yeah, this game came back scratch because there's a ring in it now because someone's jiggled their 360 while it's going and it carved a big ring into their disc.

1165
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:24,346
[SPEAKER_11]: So, people are dumb.

1166
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:28,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the X meant I shake it.

1167
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:30,629
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1168
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:32,711
[SPEAKER_11]: The system's not like the Wii controller?

1169
01:05:32,751 --> 01:05:34,052
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not motion sensitive?

1170
01:05:34,612 --> 01:05:37,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, to be honest, the system is motion sensitive.

1171
01:05:37,093 --> 01:05:39,695
[SPEAKER_11]: It will know if you're laying it flat or if you're laying it upright.

1172
01:05:41,044 --> 01:05:42,004
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true, it's true.

1173
01:05:42,744 --> 01:05:46,625
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a little, yeah, that's a little tiny little bubble that does that probably.

1174
01:05:47,045 --> 01:05:51,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, speaking of watchdog agencies, the biggest watchdog of them all is the government.

1175
01:05:52,447 --> 01:06:00,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sam Brownback is a senator, a Republican senator, and he's also somebody who is running for president in 2008.

1176
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:02,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

1177
01:06:02,889 --> 01:06:03,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise!

1178
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:08,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's exploring the Republican nomination for the president of the United States.

1179
01:06:10,478 --> 01:06:16,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam Brownback is also one of the minds behind the Video Game Rating Act, and it has been reintroduced.

1180
01:06:17,122 --> 01:06:21,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It was first introduced last September, but it is now being reintroduced for Senate.

1181
01:06:22,264 --> 01:06:31,169
[SPEAKER_04]: If this was made law, what would happen is that the ESRB, you may remember us talking about this back in September, the ESRB would have to play the final build of a game from the beginning until

1182
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:35,677
[SPEAKER_04]: to the end until they could actually give it a rating.

1183
01:06:36,018 --> 01:06:39,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I believe the way the ESRB works now, they're just filling out a questionnaire.

1184
01:06:39,481 --> 01:06:42,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they play a little bit of the game, but that's about it, right?

1185
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:44,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's the same way the MPAA works.

1186
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:47,047
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't see anyone cracking down the MPAA.

1187
01:06:47,147 --> 01:06:49,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the movies and the games should be done the exact same way.

1188
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:50,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1189
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:51,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1190
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:52,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, I take that back.

1191
01:06:52,771 --> 01:06:56,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I think movies, TV, and games should all be done the exact same way.

1192
01:06:57,015 --> 01:06:57,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1193
01:06:58,021 --> 01:07:00,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like how these... Oh, anyways, continue on with the story.

1194
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:02,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me give a quick quote, and I think Marissa wants to chime in too.

1195
01:07:03,464 --> 01:07:03,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1196
01:07:03,904 --> 01:07:06,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game reviewers... Oh, this is a quote from Mr. Brownback.

1197
01:07:06,906 --> 01:07:12,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game reviewers should be required to review the entire content of a game to ensure the accuracy of the rating.

1198
01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:20,513
[SPEAKER_04]: The current video game rating system is not as accurate as it could be because reviewers do not see the full content of games and do not even play the games they rate.

1199
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:25,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, they're going to be screwed when they have to review, like, Oblivion or an MMO.

1200
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:27,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Marissa?

1201
01:07:27,266 --> 01:07:29,088
[SPEAKER_01]: This issue in particular gets me really passionate.

1202
01:07:29,168 --> 01:07:33,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched a great documentary called This Movie Is Not Yet Rated the other day about the MPAA.

1203
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:34,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've seen it.

1204
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:39,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard of it and I really want to see it, but I've heard it's just like Super Size Me, like resonated with McDonald's.

1205
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard this movie resonated with the MVAA.

1206
01:07:42,028 --> 01:07:48,010
[SPEAKER_01]: The government should not step in, but interestingly enough, I think there's a problem when the industry regulates itself because it creates a monopoly.

1207
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:55,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand, like for movies, for example, you can go to a website, kidsinmind.com, and it just lists specifically what is in the movie.

1208
01:07:55,853 --> 01:07:59,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think a rating system is a good idea because then people interject their opinion into it.

1209
01:07:59,795 --> 01:08:01,636
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to say there's sex in this, there's etc.,

1210
01:08:02,396 --> 01:08:14,050
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know this is a really old meme, but it still amazed me that people got upset about the hot coffee mod in Grand Theft Auto, but they didn't have a problem with the fact that their five-year-old kid was killing hookers, etc.

1211
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:16,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I like the game myself, but why is sex the problem?

1212
01:08:18,314 --> 01:08:20,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect example, the hot coffee thing.

1213
01:08:20,355 --> 01:08:24,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, granted, it was an interactive little minigame, whose graphics were really bad, by the way.

1214
01:08:25,377 --> 01:08:33,902
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I don't hear anyone complaining that there's a fucking sex minigame in the original God of War and in God of War 2, which there's full fucking titties in the goddamn game.

1215
01:08:34,842 --> 01:08:36,743
[SPEAKER_11]: This wasn't, oh, it's not hidden.

1216
01:08:36,803 --> 01:08:37,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Big deal.

1217
01:08:37,403 --> 01:08:38,304
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an M-rated game.

1218
01:08:38,544 --> 01:08:42,586
[SPEAKER_11]: The difference between a 17- and 18-year-old, can you really say mindset-wise?

1219
01:08:42,646 --> 01:08:45,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, granted, okay, one's a legal adult.

1220
01:08:45,407 --> 01:08:49,010
[SPEAKER_11]: But mindset-wise, one's going to know about boobies as much as the other one.

1221
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:54,695
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because they need to pull the corncob out of their ass and stop fucking promoting a double fucking standard.

1222
01:08:54,775 --> 01:08:58,698
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you feel if the video game was the exact same thing as the movie?

1223
01:08:58,738 --> 01:09:00,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You pick up the box and on the back it says...

1224
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:03,641
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is rated R for sexuality and language.

1225
01:09:03,721 --> 01:09:05,762
[SPEAKER_09]: And it still says sexual content.

1226
01:09:05,822 --> 01:09:06,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that how they do it in Europe?

1227
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:08,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, in the UK it's the same system.

1228
01:09:08,243 --> 01:09:11,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, it said it was rated M for sexual content.

1229
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:12,944
[SPEAKER_11]: It was on there.

1230
01:09:13,504 --> 01:09:16,766
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't specify saying, oh, it's rated because of this minigame.

1231
01:09:17,106 --> 01:09:18,286
[SPEAKER_11]: It said sexual content.

1232
01:09:18,686 --> 01:09:25,989
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is really getting... Now you're starting to get into semantics here about, oh, well, is this sexual content that made it M rated and not this sexual content?

1233
01:09:26,209 --> 01:09:27,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Who gives a shit?

1234
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:29,550
[SPEAKER_11]: It's M. It says sexual content.

1235
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:31,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we need to do anything else?

1236
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:32,261
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1237
01:09:32,621 --> 01:09:32,941
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1238
01:09:32,981 --> 01:09:41,426
[SPEAKER_04]: People are stupid and there's a lot of... No, I'm not saying this about everybody because we have parents that listen to this program and you're probably smart because you know how to download a podcast.

1239
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:47,150
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of stupid parents out there and for their benefit, you know, I'm going to give a little here.

1240
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:49,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the world works with compromise, right?

1241
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:56,815
[SPEAKER_04]: My compromise is, okay, we will make one rating system so you don't have to think like, okay, I'm not that smart so I have to translate.

1242
01:09:56,855 --> 01:09:58,896
[SPEAKER_04]: An M means like an NC-17, okay?

1243
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:02,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's use one rating system across the board.

1244
01:10:02,624 --> 01:10:03,484
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my compromise.

1245
01:10:03,985 --> 01:10:06,506
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you stupid people don't have to memorize more than one system.

1246
01:10:06,526 --> 01:10:08,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure that's how they do it in Europe, isn't it?

1247
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:10,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And that makes perfect sense.

1248
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:28,762
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as actually, it's funny, sort of related to that, our good friend Rob with 2Bs, I wasn't going to cover this in the mailbag, but he sent me an article about parents pursuing MySpace for their daughter's

1249
01:10:29,349 --> 01:10:30,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Lying about being 18.

1250
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:32,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Sue your daughter!

1251
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:33,412
[SPEAKER_05]: My sister says she's 19.

1252
01:10:33,512 --> 01:10:34,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not finished.

1253
01:10:36,214 --> 01:10:41,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And their daughter going to meet up with this guy and then getting the hot nookie on and the parent was sued.

1254
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:47,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as the article states, the judge was like, fuck you, it was your job to police her.

1255
01:10:47,422 --> 01:10:49,744
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the wrong person to be suing.

1256
01:10:49,784 --> 01:10:50,745
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to sue the internet.

1257
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:52,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Internet is the blame.

1258
01:10:52,593 --> 01:10:53,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Sue Al Gore for Inventigan.

1259
01:10:53,954 --> 01:10:55,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to go ahead just a little bit into it.

1260
01:10:56,515 --> 01:11:02,557
[SPEAKER_09]: A 12-year-old Texas girl lied about being 18, met a 19-year-old man for dinner at a movie and had some hot nookie.

1261
01:11:03,117 --> 01:11:08,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the parents tried to sue MySpace for $30 million, accusing the site of negligence.

1262
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:16,962
[SPEAKER_09]: But the judge in the case, Judge Sam Sparks, turned around and I quote, If anyone had a duty to protect Julie Doe, it was her parents, not MySpace.

1263
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:20,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and Nestle, what's in Judge Sam Sparks?

1264
01:11:20,692 --> 01:11:20,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1265
01:11:21,072 --> 01:11:24,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Judge Sam Sparks is our American Citizen of the Week.

1266
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:25,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

1267
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:33,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Our hats off to you for telling this parent to go fuck herself.

1268
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:41,706
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why I think it was worth noting is that, you know, and actually Rob with two Bs also mentioned it,

1269
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:48,656
[SPEAKER_09]: that this might actually set a precedence now for future cases involving parental negligence.

1270
01:11:49,317 --> 01:11:49,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1271
01:11:49,737 --> 01:11:52,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I just get really passionate on this issue for being exceptionally yappy.

1272
01:11:53,241 --> 01:12:04,232
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, I agree with the idea of a rating system because it is unfair that children feel a lot of pressure nowadays to be hip and cool, etc., and they want the same things we do, which is a completely different rant of mine.

1273
01:12:04,252 --> 01:12:04,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Sex?

1274
01:12:05,093 --> 01:12:05,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Sex is cool, too.

1275
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:11,211
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a completely different rant of mine that we need to allow children to still be children and not little adults.

1276
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:19,632
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, my only beef with the rating system is, though, is that the G, PG, etc., that, again, is a personal opinion.

1277
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:35,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, though, I think it makes it easier for parents, for those who approve of more sexual content because their own opinion or approve of less violence or more violence, etc., you just say explicitly what is in the game that is different than saying, well, I believe that this, because there's 12 different kinds of rated R movies.

1278
01:12:36,295 --> 01:12:38,277
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there could be 12 different kinds of rated R games.

1279
01:12:57,131 --> 01:12:59,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a big, big difference.

1280
01:12:59,452 --> 01:13:00,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's the other thing, too.

1281
01:13:00,853 --> 01:13:06,776
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hate how they always say, oh, well, we need to put more responsibility on, you know, the ESRB and rating these games.

1282
01:13:06,796 --> 01:13:12,999
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you have to put more responsibility on these parents who just ignore the ratings and they say, oh, I didn't know this content was in here.

1283
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:20,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you didn't know because you didn't read and you bought it for your five-year-old because, you know, you'll do anything for your five-year-old and you won't even, you know, question it.

1284
01:13:20,623 --> 01:13:24,305
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll just like, okay, I'm going to buy him... Buy him a fucking porno then.

1285
01:13:24,345 --> 01:13:25,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, if...

1286
01:13:26,053 --> 01:13:28,414
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's going to be such an issue with you... Wow.

1287
01:13:28,694 --> 01:13:34,535
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just... I don't understand... And I don't understand how... Okay, granted the content was hidden in the game.

1288
01:13:34,695 --> 01:13:36,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yippee, it's hidden in the game.

1289
01:13:36,735 --> 01:13:48,258
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I created, say, a series of GameShark codes or something like that and made a topless mod for Tomb Raider, you know, a very elaborate process I might add that would probably be...

1290
01:13:49,966 --> 01:13:50,827
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1291
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:09,821
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1292
01:14:26,636 --> 01:14:30,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know your child can do real fucking in Grand Theft Auto?

1293
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, power fucking with the X button.

1294
01:14:33,501 --> 01:14:35,323
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, coming to Grand Theft Auto tonight on Xdrop.

1295
01:14:35,983 --> 01:14:39,106
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's like, I think parents go off of what they hear.

1296
01:14:39,801 --> 01:14:41,423
[SPEAKER_04]: and not what they're actually seeing.

1297
01:14:41,903 --> 01:14:45,667
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much of that sensationalism that I think takes everything to the oomph degree.

1298
01:14:45,927 --> 01:14:47,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't actually agree with that.

1299
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:53,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to say this really quick because do you remember how big that Super Bowl thing with Janet Jackson was?

1300
01:14:54,516 --> 01:14:58,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Her titty was on television for a half a second.

1301
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,322
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was covered.

1302
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:01,163
[SPEAKER_12]: It was covered.

1303
01:15:03,769 --> 01:15:07,950
[SPEAKER_11]: It was covered with a stupid nipple shield.

1304
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:15,273
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw the exact same thing on fucking Girls Next Door where she has a stupid sticker over her nipple and then that was acceptable.

1305
01:15:15,353 --> 01:15:16,173
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't a sticker.

1306
01:15:16,193 --> 01:15:16,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually a piercing.

1307
01:15:17,133 --> 01:15:21,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, my grandma came out once and didn't realize I was in the room and I didn't sue her.

1308
01:15:22,115 --> 01:15:23,395
Movies kill.

1309
01:15:23,415 --> 01:15:24,076
Movies kill.

1310
01:15:25,656 --> 01:15:27,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have made me gay, but I didn't sue her.

1311
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:28,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1312
01:15:29,177 --> 01:15:29,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to.

1313
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,298
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what made me gay.

1314
01:15:31,398 --> 01:15:31,498
[SPEAKER_04]: It's

1315
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I firmly believe it's a biological thing.

1316
01:15:34,311 --> 01:15:34,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1317
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:36,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, cock made me gay.

1318
01:15:38,592 --> 01:15:40,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1319
01:15:41,772 --> 01:15:44,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryoma in chat says, Sky, never talk about that again.

1320
01:15:44,713 --> 01:15:45,653
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm serious.

1321
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:49,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what kid didn't accidentally see a titty at some point, you know?

1322
01:15:50,934 --> 01:15:52,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or a dick, you know?

1323
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Duke Nukem had boobies in it too.

1324
01:15:56,196 --> 01:15:59,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pixelated 8-bit boobies.

1325
01:15:59,256 --> 01:16:00,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what they look like.

1326
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:01,577
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hot.

1327
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:03,151
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1328
01:16:05,133 --> 01:16:06,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, moving on.

1329
01:16:08,555 --> 01:16:13,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we invite you to give your feedback here on our program through our mailbag, among other things.

1330
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,222
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to be an interactive program because it's not just about us.

1331
01:16:17,262 --> 01:16:20,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just about the three of us that run this program.

1332
01:16:20,224 --> 01:16:23,306
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just about Marissa or Chris or any of the other folks you've heard.

1333
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:25,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris thinks it's all about her, but it's actually not.

1334
01:16:26,195 --> 01:16:37,404
[SPEAKER_04]: We invite you guys to interact with us by the chat room, by the voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or through the email bag, which you can email us every week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1335
01:16:37,424 --> 01:16:38,665
[SPEAKER_04]: We love getting your emails.

1336
01:16:39,146 --> 01:16:41,508
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura, she's the queen of the mail bag.

1337
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:45,351
[SPEAKER_04]: She likes to jump in there and pull out some of her favorite emails.

1338
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:46,091
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to do that right now.

1339
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:46,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to pull it out.

1340
01:16:56,075 --> 01:17:00,196
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have said that on mic.

1341
01:17:00,276 --> 01:17:03,498
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68 says, and you penetrate her weak point for massive damage.

1342
01:17:04,678 --> 01:17:05,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag, please.

1343
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:07,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Alien crab bag.

1344
01:17:07,659 --> 01:17:08,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, wait.

1345
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:08,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1346
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,240
[SPEAKER_04]: WTB, mail.

1347
01:17:14,721 --> 01:17:14,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

1348
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:15,782
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1349
01:17:16,162 --> 01:17:16,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1350
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:19,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Four emails.

1351
01:17:20,263 --> 01:17:22,044
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one from...

1352
01:17:24,252 --> 01:17:25,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure exactly what to say.

1353
01:17:26,233 --> 01:17:27,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we try something new tonight?

1354
01:17:28,313 --> 01:17:34,716
[SPEAKER_04]: When you say that we're going to do the first email, what I'd like Chris to do is to say very sexily, letter number one.

1355
01:17:34,896 --> 01:17:35,656
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so here we go.

1356
01:17:35,976 --> 01:17:37,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So can we start from the top, please?

1357
01:17:37,437 --> 01:17:38,217
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

1358
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:41,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Say the first email.

1359
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:43,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Chris.

1360
01:17:44,419 --> 01:17:45,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Letter number one.

1361
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:46,600
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, very good.

1362
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:52,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Rob, DarkSakura, and Loki, I just wanted to say hello to you all and tell you how much I enjoy your program.

1363
01:17:52,799 --> 01:17:54,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been listening for a little over a year now.

1364
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:59,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually first found out about you guys when looking for websites that were optimized to view on my PSP.

1365
01:17:59,784 --> 01:18:03,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Hint, hint, hint, hint!

1366
01:18:04,006 --> 01:18:05,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, what's the deal with Rice Princess?

1367
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,829
[SPEAKER_09]: She has a filthy, filthy mouth and is incredibly offensive.

1368
01:18:08,069 --> 01:18:09,430
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have her on the show more often.

1369
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:10,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the good work.

1370
01:18:11,929 --> 01:18:12,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Rice Princess still here?

1371
01:18:13,049 --> 01:18:14,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go find Rice Princess.

1372
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk smack about Rice Princess quick before I get her in here.

1373
01:18:16,911 --> 01:18:23,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, Irene is so... I'm going to skip the... I'm going to go into the next email.

1374
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:26,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Email number two.

1375
01:18:28,076 --> 01:18:29,976
[SPEAKER_09]: You sounded like you had to go to the bathroom.

1376
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:32,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait a minute.

1377
01:18:32,357 --> 01:18:35,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess, we just read one of your fan letters on the program.

1378
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:37,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it true that you have an offensive, filthy mouth?

1379
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:38,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.

1380
01:18:39,212 --> 01:18:41,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know any dirty jokes you can tell our listeners this week?

1381
01:18:41,813 --> 01:18:47,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Because our emailer said they liked having you on the show because you had a very offensive mouth, so we just wanted you to say something offensive.

1382
01:18:48,196 --> 01:18:49,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, poop.

1383
01:18:50,838 --> 01:18:51,618
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty offensive.

1384
01:18:51,638 --> 01:18:53,639
[SPEAKER_04]: That was on an offensive scale of 1 to 10.

1385
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:54,560
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like a 3.

1386
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:00,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, how about you lick the crusty poop out of my butt, and then you lick the crusty poop off my finger?

1387
01:19:01,163 --> 01:19:01,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to go.

1388
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that was a 9.

1389
01:19:03,164 --> 01:19:03,424
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a 9.

1390
01:19:03,464 --> 01:19:04,284
[SPEAKER_04]: That was much better.

1391
01:19:04,385 --> 01:19:05,585
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you, Rice Princess.

1392
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:07,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your contributions.

1393
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:09,680
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good thing we haven't done any more Yamama jokes.

1394
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:11,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want me to do it again?

1395
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:12,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you already did.

1396
01:19:14,804 --> 01:19:15,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1397
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:16,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I already did the email.

1398
01:19:17,146 --> 01:19:21,929
[SPEAKER_09]: This one is email number two from SpeedyF40.

1399
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:27,333
[SPEAKER_09]: A year and a half ago I tuned into OLR for the first time after finding it on Podcast Alley.

1400
01:19:27,473 --> 01:19:34,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not hooked, but like a festering rash, the good kind, your show grew on me and a year and a half later I am still here.

1401
01:19:36,823 --> 01:19:38,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1402
01:19:39,064 --> 01:19:41,285
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like the good kind of festering rash.

1403
01:19:41,405 --> 01:19:43,586
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good compliment.

1404
01:19:43,986 --> 01:19:47,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you guys are like the festering rash.

1405
01:19:47,728 --> 01:19:50,630
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the festering rash of my love.

1406
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:57,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Could somebody who has not written a review on iTunes yet, somebody in chat, volunteer to do this.

1407
01:19:57,193 --> 01:19:57,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually haven't.

1408
01:19:57,974 --> 01:19:59,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I want somebody in chat to yell out, claim this.

1409
01:20:00,235 --> 01:20:03,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to iTunes and give us a five-star review, which actually everyone should do.

1410
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:04,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Hint, hint.

1411
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:15,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want everybody saying the show is a festering rash, so I want one person from chat to nominate themselves to go write a five-star review on iTunes and put, this show is the festering rash of gaming podcasts.

1412
01:20:16,154 --> 01:20:16,735
[SPEAKER_01]: The good kind.

1413
01:20:16,835 --> 01:20:17,375
[SPEAKER_04]: The good kind.

1414
01:20:17,575 --> 01:20:21,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Genital herpes is forever, and so is my love for Orange Lounge.

1415
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, somebody can lay claim to that one, too.

1416
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:24,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one.

1417
01:20:24,618 --> 01:20:25,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I finish reading this now?

1418
01:20:25,998 --> 01:20:26,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you may.

1419
01:20:27,319 --> 01:20:27,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1420
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:28,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Fester, Jamie, fester.

1421
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:30,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Bite my butt, but not really.

1422
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,321
[SPEAKER_09]: and you have even used one of my calls on air.

1423
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:37,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I love independent radio and I feel that your show is doing a service to the gamer community.

1424
01:20:38,085 --> 01:20:40,346
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR has even inspired me to do my own show.

1425
01:20:41,147 --> 01:20:43,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you suck because you don't like Max.

1426
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:46,911
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's really not what he said.

1427
01:20:50,193 --> 01:20:50,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1428
01:20:51,714 --> 01:20:52,355
[SPEAKER_09]: He didn't say that.

1429
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:55,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some people may see you as an ass.

1430
01:20:55,493 --> 01:20:57,414
[SPEAKER_09]: You are, just not all the time.

1431
01:20:57,954 --> 01:21:00,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the time I see you as an honest, down-to-earth realist.

1432
01:21:00,515 --> 01:21:07,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you set the story straight, and your ties to the inside of the gaming world give the show a sense of added credibility.

1433
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:10,097
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, apples do suck for gaming.

1434
01:21:10,557 --> 01:21:11,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy a PC.

1435
01:21:12,917 --> 01:21:17,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say in two to four years, Apple computers will be a formidable gaming computer for the average person.

1436
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:20,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Real gamers will stick with the PC, but that is a whole other thing.

1437
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:26,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, your alternative views on gaming and the gaming culture broaden my mind and keep ideas flowing through my head.

1438
01:21:26,713 --> 01:21:30,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I love how you speak your mind, even though I know we will have some political differences.

1439
01:21:30,455 --> 01:21:33,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I hold your opinions on issues that affect gamers in extremely high regards.

1440
01:21:33,676 --> 01:21:34,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you.

1441
01:21:34,717 --> 01:21:36,398
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes me feel warm in a special place.

1442
01:21:36,998 --> 01:21:38,559
[SPEAKER_01]: My ex-boyfriend actually had a good quote on that.

1443
01:21:38,579 --> 01:21:42,880
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, Macintosh makes the best computer out there.

1444
01:21:43,401 --> 01:21:44,221
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the problem is?

1445
01:21:45,622 --> 01:21:46,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody cares.

1446
01:21:48,677 --> 01:21:49,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have another email, actually?

1447
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:51,278
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more.

1448
01:21:51,519 --> 01:21:58,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I wanted to do the sexy announcement, because on the internet, I'm kind of geek famous for being the voice of a character on LJ Drama.

1449
01:21:59,063 --> 01:21:59,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1450
01:22:00,043 --> 01:22:01,524
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, the third one is to Rob.

1451
01:22:01,944 --> 01:22:02,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yay.

1452
01:22:02,544 --> 01:22:05,106
[SPEAKER_09]: You got a lot of balls being a gay gamer on the internet.

1453
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:07,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Pun intended.

1454
01:22:08,368 --> 01:22:12,810
[SPEAKER_09]: When I jumped on air for my own show, I would have to say that I model...

1455
01:22:14,889 --> 01:22:17,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I model some of my on-air presence from yours.

1456
01:22:18,251 --> 01:22:22,792
[SPEAKER_09]: With me being straight guy, I come off as being very enthusiastic.

1457
01:22:22,872 --> 01:22:25,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't get messages telling me I talk too much yet.

1458
01:22:27,498 --> 01:22:28,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I love OLR.

1459
01:22:28,378 --> 01:22:29,819
[SPEAKER_09]: It is polished and it is brilliant.

1460
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:34,581
[SPEAKER_09]: From your unconventional views on gaming and gaming culture to the straight-up format of the show, I love it.

1461
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:38,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not be who I am today on the internet and in real life if it was not for you guys.

1462
01:22:38,782 --> 01:22:39,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Independent Radio for the win.

1463
01:22:39,983 --> 01:22:40,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Speedy F40.

1464
01:22:40,803 --> 01:22:41,083
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

1465
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:43,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell Rice Princess I have a crush on her because she sounds like a freak.

1466
01:22:44,745 --> 01:22:44,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1467
01:22:45,025 --> 01:22:46,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Irene!

1468
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:48,046
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a fan!

1469
01:22:48,986 --> 01:22:52,267
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very... Wait, didn't he say he ran his own podcast?

1470
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:52,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1471
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:52,808
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

1472
01:22:53,108 --> 01:22:53,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't say.

1473
01:22:53,788 --> 01:22:55,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this his Speedy F40?

1474
01:22:55,348 --> 01:22:56,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there like a signature or something?

1475
01:22:56,349 --> 01:22:56,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a crush.

1476
01:22:56,969 --> 01:22:59,330
[SPEAKER_09]: He has a crush on you because you're a freak, is what he said.

1477
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're a freak.

1478
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:01,051
[SPEAKER_09]: SpeedyF40.

1479
01:23:01,712 --> 01:23:08,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, if you're listening, and we're pretty sure that you are because you're amazing, send us a link to your podcast and we'll plug you.

1480
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:08,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.

1481
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:10,436
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to pimp that podcast.

1482
01:23:10,476 --> 01:23:12,917
[SPEAKER_09]: We will totally plug you in the most awesome way.

1483
01:23:12,977 --> 01:23:21,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, not to spend too much time talking about ourselves, because I don't want to be like that, but that's truly one of the best compliments we could ever get.

1484
01:23:21,562 --> 01:23:22,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, it's on here.

1485
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:22,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it is?

1486
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:23,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.

1487
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:27,733
[SPEAKER_09]: WCRadio.com 5pm Eastern Time on Saturday.

1488
01:23:28,513 --> 01:23:33,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's part of the WCRadio, Warcraft Radio, like a huge radio thing.

1489
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:33,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, isn't it?

1490
01:23:34,196 --> 01:23:35,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Warcraft Radio?

1491
01:23:35,337 --> 01:23:36,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've heard of them before.

1492
01:23:37,878 --> 01:23:45,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if this is his or not, but it's in the signature, so check it out maybe?

1493
01:23:45,242 --> 01:23:50,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if you are going to spend all day playing World of Warcraft, I know the soundtrack gets old, so you might as well listen to Warcraft Radio, right?

1494
01:23:51,265 --> 01:23:51,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So go for it.

1495
01:23:52,326 --> 01:23:53,026
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very cool.

1496
01:23:53,987 --> 01:24:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's truly one of the best compliments but can I say something about the gay issue without turning the show too gay it's already gay it's actually not really been a big deal for me to be gay on this program because I give a lot of props to the gaming community and I think the youth in general is that I really don't think people seem to care and I think if they do care they're not listening so hey, all for the best this probably isn't their type of show anyway if it was something they care about they'd probably want to listen to Bigot Radio

1497
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:33,818
[SPEAKER_04]: But most people that have listened to this program really don't care, and I think that speaks volumes about the gaming community, is that, you know, hey, there's nothing wrong with being gay, but it's just, you know, it's whatever.

1498
01:24:34,038 --> 01:24:45,265
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want this to be the gay show either, because that's not all I am, and I think people get that wrong impression about me sometimes, is that, you know, I'm the gay gamer, and that's all I can think about is, like, how much cock is in my games.

1499
01:24:45,565 --> 01:24:46,486
[SPEAKER_06]: At least you're not the titty queen.

1500
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:51,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we plugged the lesbian thing on me just because it's funny.

1501
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:54,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the straight men, you know.

1502
01:24:54,345 --> 01:24:56,706
[SPEAKER_09]: This segment is getting entirely too gay.

1503
01:24:56,726 --> 01:24:57,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sorry.

1504
01:24:57,466 --> 01:24:58,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say it.

1505
01:24:58,266 --> 01:24:59,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about your joystick some more.

1506
01:24:59,827 --> 01:25:00,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, sexy please.

1507
01:25:00,867 --> 01:25:01,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Except that boobs are hot.

1508
01:25:02,467 --> 01:25:05,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was just going to say it's not all gay radio unless you talk about your joystick too much.

1509
01:25:05,868 --> 01:25:08,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh.

1510
01:25:08,349 --> 01:25:11,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, it's me, Victoria.

1511
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:14,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Email number three.

1512
01:25:15,531 --> 01:25:16,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that was hot.

1513
01:25:16,371 --> 01:25:16,811
[SPEAKER_04]: That was hot.

1514
01:25:17,642 --> 01:25:18,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a semi.

1515
01:25:20,564 --> 01:25:23,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR, I started World of Warcraft for the new year.

1516
01:25:23,646 --> 01:25:27,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I fell in love with WoW until I installed the Burning Crusade expansion pack.

1517
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:28,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1518
01:25:28,109 --> 01:25:28,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1519
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:31,852
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I would not interrupt you if this was not the best thing ever.

1520
01:25:31,872 --> 01:25:32,973
[SPEAKER_04]: You interrupt me all the time.

1521
01:25:33,013 --> 01:25:35,254
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I would not do this if this was not the best thing ever, DarkSakura.

1522
01:25:35,274 --> 01:25:35,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.

1523
01:25:35,835 --> 01:25:40,258
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Janai says, maybe we should rename the show to the Games and You Show.

1524
01:25:40,698 --> 01:25:42,039
[SPEAKER_04]: G-A-Y, Games and You.

1525
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:52,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand, but it wouldn't start up, so I reinstalled it like two times, and eventually I just called Blizzard.

1526
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:56,583
[SPEAKER_09]: They told me that my graphics card just happened to not be compatible with World of Warcraft.

1527
01:25:57,144 --> 01:26:01,306
[SPEAKER_09]: He told me luckily I was able to play for a while, but once I installed the expansion pack, it stopped working.

1528
01:26:02,046 --> 01:26:06,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a VS3G Unichrome Pro ITG graphics card.

1529
01:26:06,909 --> 01:26:11,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to warn anyone who plays World of Warcraft or is starting, just make sure that... Excuse me.

1530
01:26:11,477 --> 01:26:18,083
[SPEAKER_09]: You should upgrade to a new graphics card if you have the VIAS 3G Unichrome Pro IGT graphics card.

1531
01:26:20,845 --> 01:26:21,426
[SPEAKER_04]: What, what, Loki?

1532
01:26:22,987 --> 01:26:24,688
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got an in-the-groove graphics card.

1533
01:26:24,849 --> 01:26:25,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, IGT?

1534
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:27,831
[SPEAKER_11]: That shoots a hole in my joke.

1535
01:26:28,512 --> 01:26:28,832
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

1536
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:32,735
[SPEAKER_09]: My cousin bought Burning Crusade for my birthday, and now I can't play World of Warcraft at all.

1537
01:26:32,815 --> 01:26:33,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice birthday present, isn't it?

1538
01:26:34,517 --> 01:26:35,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, don't cry, emo kid.

1539
01:26:38,379 --> 01:26:39,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Tough advice from Chris.

1540
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:45,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I installed it and it was a pain in the ass, but I've got a Mac, so I don't need to upgrade anything.

1541
01:26:45,922 --> 01:26:46,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Next.

1542
01:26:47,623 --> 01:26:48,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what number?

1543
01:26:49,044 --> 01:26:49,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up, Rosa.

1544
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:51,685
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from Let's Have Tea.

1545
01:26:51,705 --> 01:26:53,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, email what?

1546
01:26:53,986 --> 01:26:54,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Number four.

1547
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:56,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Email number four.

1548
01:26:57,988 --> 01:26:58,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey there.

1549
01:26:59,769 --> 01:27:00,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I don't know.

1550
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:01,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my semi went away because she sounded 17.

1551
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you.

1552
01:27:05,371 --> 01:27:06,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.

1553
01:27:08,453 --> 01:27:09,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey there, OLR.

1554
01:27:09,434 --> 01:27:10,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have tea here.

1555
01:27:11,035 --> 01:27:15,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been a long-time listener, even though I have only actually tuned into the live show a few times, Podcast for the Win.

1556
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:17,759
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what this email is about, though.

1557
01:27:17,819 --> 01:27:21,301
[SPEAKER_09]: A few weeks back, you were talking about the Wii being used as a fitness weight loss tool.

1558
01:27:21,661 --> 01:27:25,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I was digging through Dig, and came across a few interesting articles.

1559
01:27:25,964 --> 01:27:30,626
[SPEAKER_09]: One article was showing how somebody lost nine pounds playing Wii Sports for 30 minutes a day for six weeks.

1560
01:27:30,686 --> 01:27:32,488
[SPEAKER_09]: He didn't change his normal eating habits at all.

1561
01:27:32,548 --> 01:27:33,468
[SPEAKER_09]: He just played the game more.

1562
01:27:34,028 --> 01:27:34,969
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because it's exercise.

1563
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:37,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, it's...

1564
01:27:38,658 --> 01:27:39,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Activity for 30 minutes.

1565
01:27:40,058 --> 01:27:40,759
[SPEAKER_09]: It will raise the heart rate.

1566
01:27:41,479 --> 01:27:45,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I burn weight doing massage three days a week for 30 minutes.

1567
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1568
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:50,121
[SPEAKER_06]: You do any kind of exercise for 30 minutes a day.

1569
01:27:50,201 --> 01:27:54,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, if you don't eat McDonald's during that same length of time, you'll lose twice as much.

1570
01:27:54,863 --> 01:27:55,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

1571
01:27:56,823 --> 01:28:00,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I saw another article about wrist weight with the Wii logo on them.

1572
01:28:00,764 --> 01:28:06,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, they were fan-created concept products, but there are similar products out there for similar workout activities.

1573
01:28:07,185 --> 01:28:08,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not prescribing nor recommending anything.

1574
01:28:08,586 --> 01:28:09,426
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a prescription.

1575
01:28:09,446 --> 01:28:10,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to protect my ass.

1576
01:28:33,633 --> 01:28:42,075
[SPEAKER_09]: You do run a risk of damaging your wrists using a wrist weight with anything that you have to flick or move your wrist with.

1577
01:28:43,156 --> 01:28:45,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Wrist weights are actually not all that safe to use.

1578
01:28:45,817 --> 01:28:46,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

1579
01:28:46,417 --> 01:28:49,558
[SPEAKER_11]: No one wants to break their masturbating wrists.

1580
01:28:51,338 --> 01:28:53,559
[SPEAKER_11]: My problem is I would not want... I have a point.

1581
01:28:53,719 --> 01:28:54,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1582
01:28:55,579 --> 01:29:00,961
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to put more effort into it, I say stand up and do it.

1583
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:08,893
[SPEAKER_09]: You burn more calories standing up.

1584
01:29:09,934 --> 01:29:16,997
[SPEAKER_04]: My problem is that I would not want to wear the wrist weights because I would be afraid that my wrist would hang down more than it already does.

1585
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:19,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'd look uber gay.

1586
01:29:19,638 --> 01:29:21,759
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a visual there.

1587
01:29:24,101 --> 01:29:25,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Radio visual joke.

1588
01:29:26,682 --> 01:29:28,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, I got some advice.

1589
01:29:29,063 --> 01:29:30,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Get up and go to the fucking gym!

1590
01:29:32,626 --> 01:29:37,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no patience for people who sit there and say, you get a great workout playing the video game.

1591
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:38,429
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you don't.

1592
01:29:38,669 --> 01:29:40,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, yeah, you do if you play DDR.

1593
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:42,191
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the same thing, though.

1594
01:29:42,731 --> 01:29:43,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually.

1595
01:29:44,132 --> 01:29:46,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I can give you DDR.

1596
01:29:46,593 --> 01:29:48,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I did get up and play.

1597
01:29:49,074 --> 01:29:54,677
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a difference if you actually get up and move your arm as opposed to sitting on the couch and flicking your wrist.

1598
01:29:55,317 --> 01:29:59,299
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get up and get into the game, you actually are elevating your heart rate.

1599
01:29:59,379 --> 01:30:02,221
[SPEAKER_09]: You are actually burning more than you are sitting down and flicking your wrist.

1600
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:10,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you need to also stop eating junk food and you need to go outside in the sunshine and you need to check yourself into a gym so you don't turn fat.

1601
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:12,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it as like steps.

1602
01:30:13,248 --> 01:30:14,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1603
01:30:35,996 --> 01:30:36,316
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1604
01:30:59,864 --> 01:31:03,585
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, I mean, I completely agree with Chris, you know, it's good to get out of the house, etc.

1605
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,585
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm in complete agreement on that.

1606
01:31:05,605 --> 01:31:06,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that, too.

1607
01:31:06,346 --> 01:31:08,046
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes going to the gym sucks.

1608
01:31:08,906 --> 01:31:16,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's face it, people go there to meet other people, people are checking each other out, and when I go in there in my fat ass, I am not interested in that.

1609
01:31:16,308 --> 01:31:23,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to get a workout, and if I can do it at home and not be bored out of my brain because the Stairmaster goes nowhere, I feel like a hamster wheel.

1610
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:25,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm on the hamster wheel of life.

1611
01:31:26,012 --> 01:31:28,613
[SPEAKER_01]: You pay $50 and you go up!

1612
01:31:30,054 --> 01:31:31,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis Leary for the win.

1613
01:31:31,394 --> 01:31:32,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Dennis Leary.

1614
01:31:32,975 --> 01:31:34,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Life sucks, get a helmet!

1615
01:31:35,355 --> 01:31:36,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, I'm sorry.

1616
01:31:38,016 --> 01:31:52,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thing, though, is, you know, and this is what I'm going to do, because I used to be an utter gym junkie before I developed chronic fatigue syndrome, because I was going to the gym five days a week, I dropped something like 85 pounds in two and a half years.

1617
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:53,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I hate you for.

1618
01:31:54,882 --> 01:31:54,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1619
01:31:55,467 --> 01:31:59,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie used to have a few extra pounds, but she's lost it all.

1620
01:31:59,829 --> 01:32:00,249
[SPEAKER_04]: She's hot.

1621
01:32:01,049 --> 01:32:13,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care saying I went from a size 22 to a size 12 in two and a half years.

1622
01:32:13,974 --> 01:32:18,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to the gym was good for me because I actually like to lift weights because I like being stronger.

1623
01:32:18,897 --> 01:32:20,737
[SPEAKER_09]: But cardio is fucking boring.

1624
01:32:21,397 --> 01:32:30,179
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm actually, now that I have the okay to go back to the gym, I'm actually going to be taking... Okay, I've been slightly obsessed with Dancing with the Stars lately, after watching Stacey Keebler's legs.

1625
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:32,479
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to actually take ballroom dancing.

1626
01:32:32,879 --> 01:32:33,600
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they should have?

1627
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:34,780
[SPEAKER_09]: They should have Wii Yoga.

1628
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Yoga would be amazing!

1629
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:43,101
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of have something like that on Xbox, and I think there was a version on GameCube.

1630
01:32:43,121 --> 01:32:44,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there was on PS2.

1631
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:45,782
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that Think Fitness game or whatever.

1632
01:32:46,302 --> 01:32:47,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it had yoga in it.

1633
01:32:47,422 --> 01:32:47,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1634
01:32:50,749 --> 01:32:59,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the entirety of our listeners to know that when I say, yeah, you can fucking go to the gym, this is from experience, okay?

1635
01:33:00,096 --> 01:33:01,478
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get off your ass and do it.

1636
01:33:01,778 --> 01:33:02,859
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to want it bad enough.

1637
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:06,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing changes until you want it bad enough to make it change.

1638
01:33:07,577 --> 01:33:08,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Jamie.

1639
01:33:08,117 --> 01:33:10,958
[SPEAKER_04]: But would it be fair to say there's also alternatives?

1640
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:15,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have a lot of folks in chat saying gyms are expensive or folks don't like the gym environment.

1641
01:33:15,959 --> 01:33:20,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Like JV Mon says, gyms in the village in NYC are just big bathhouses with exercise equipment.

1642
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:21,520
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called going outside and walking.

1643
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:22,580
[SPEAKER_04]: There's alternatives.

1644
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe go outside, run.

1645
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:26,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Go outside, walk.

1646
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:27,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Find a walking buddy.

1647
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:29,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Do something to make yourself more fit.

1648
01:33:29,742 --> 01:33:33,122
[SPEAKER_04]: But wouldn't this be at least a little baby step in the right direction?

1649
01:33:33,523 --> 01:33:34,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I granted that.

1650
01:33:34,883 --> 01:33:35,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I granted that.

1651
01:33:35,922 --> 01:33:37,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, people annoy me.

1652
01:33:38,244 --> 01:33:41,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And for Ryoma, a special message for you, fuck your Yankee blue jeans.

1653
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:45,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

1654
01:33:46,171 --> 01:33:48,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, there's more to that email.

1655
01:33:48,453 --> 01:33:48,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, more?

1656
01:33:48,893 --> 01:33:50,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, wow.

1657
01:33:50,455 --> 01:33:50,935
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

1658
01:33:51,395 --> 01:33:52,076
[SPEAKER_09]: We were at the end.

1659
01:33:53,371 --> 01:33:57,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I love the show, and thank you so much for the many hours of entertainment and news you have provided everyone.

1660
01:33:58,373 --> 01:34:06,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a, quote, truck driver, pickup truck, haha, and have to drive a little over an hour straight every Saturday and Sunday, so your podcast really helps pass the time.

1661
01:34:06,657 --> 01:34:07,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks again, and best wishes.

1662
01:34:08,637 --> 01:34:15,780
[SPEAKER_09]: And it also says, let's have tea rates as low as 4.65% refinance $150,000 loan for $579 a month.

1663
01:34:17,121 --> 01:34:17,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

1664
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:19,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And you want to know what's funny?

1665
01:34:20,662 --> 01:34:22,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Since I work in the mortgage industry...

1666
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:28,469
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually isn't really all that great unless you have an interest-only loan.

1667
01:34:28,649 --> 01:34:31,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that some ad that goes on the bottom of the email automatically?

1668
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:33,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's hilarious.

1669
01:34:33,531 --> 01:34:36,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I work in the mortgage industry, so whenever I see those things, I go, is that shitty?

1670
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:39,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know how to read loan documents.

1671
01:34:40,152 --> 01:34:41,293
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually is another language.

1672
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:42,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad this isn't a banking show.

1673
01:34:43,873 --> 01:34:46,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but I have tomorrow off, so suck it!

1674
01:34:47,566 --> 01:34:48,386
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you suck it.

1675
01:34:48,626 --> 01:34:49,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to work tomorrow.

1676
01:34:50,147 --> 01:34:51,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Suck it twice, huh?

1677
01:34:51,747 --> 01:34:52,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Suck it infinity.

1678
01:34:53,168 --> 01:34:54,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah?

1679
01:34:55,388 --> 01:34:57,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can eat a hairy clam.

1680
01:34:59,830 --> 01:35:02,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she tell me to eat a hairy clit on?

1681
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:05,451
[SPEAKER_06]: She said a hairy clam.

1682
01:35:06,391 --> 01:35:07,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Polish my pearl, Rob.

1683
01:35:08,712 --> 01:35:09,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking gross.

1684
01:35:11,293 --> 01:35:12,913
[SPEAKER_04]: This show just got rated AO.

1685
01:35:16,408 --> 01:35:17,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe.

1686
01:35:18,088 --> 01:35:21,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think, in like, what is this, episode 220?

1687
01:35:21,469 --> 01:35:24,890
[SPEAKER_04]: In 220 episodes of Orange House Radio, that was the foulest thing that bitch has ever said to me.

1688
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the top Irene's crusty shit.

1689
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:30,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

1690
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:30,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, Rob.

1691
01:35:31,271 --> 01:35:32,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, you are a douchebag.

1692
01:35:33,691 --> 01:35:35,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Rob is the official douchebag.

1693
01:35:35,812 --> 01:35:36,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1694
01:35:37,052 --> 01:35:42,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you bringing up like five-year-old drama of a guy that drives me nuts?

1695
01:35:42,613 --> 01:35:43,833
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this guy who drives me

1696
01:35:44,594 --> 01:35:45,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's like Neil's on a chalkboard.

1697
01:35:46,155 --> 01:35:48,476
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, I'm not going to say it, because I'm not going to give attention.

1698
01:35:49,016 --> 01:35:49,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say it.

1699
01:35:50,357 --> 01:35:55,499
[SPEAKER_04]: He works for a major gaming blog now, and I'm just like, oh, this guy's so annoying.

1700
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:03,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he called me a douchebag once at a DDR tournament, and my response, I was like, because Irene was with me, I was like, oh my god, Irene, I'm vinegar and water.

1701
01:36:03,903 --> 01:36:04,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that?

1702
01:36:06,785 --> 01:36:07,325
You're clean.

1703
01:36:07,965 --> 01:36:09,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, at least I'm clean.

1704
01:36:09,606 --> 01:36:10,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut your hair.

1705
01:36:10,927 --> 01:36:11,527
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, I'll

1706
01:36:12,489 --> 01:36:12,869
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1707
01:36:13,229 --> 01:36:15,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get into drama, because I really don't care.

1708
01:36:16,531 --> 01:36:17,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at least years old.

1709
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:20,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know why this person didn't like me, to be honest.

1710
01:36:20,974 --> 01:36:24,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he... I mean, I know why I don't like him, because he didn't like me.

1711
01:36:24,896 --> 01:36:26,137
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you started it.

1712
01:36:26,437 --> 01:36:31,680
[SPEAKER_09]: He has an electrocuted corncob, but yes, it has this, but just so tight, that any time they pull it out, it bleeds.

1713
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:32,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1714
01:36:33,061 --> 01:36:34,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we please change the subject?

1715
01:36:34,161 --> 01:36:34,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to talk about it.

1716
01:36:35,182 --> 01:36:37,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just trying to talk about the years old drama.

1717
01:36:37,763 --> 01:36:38,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, uh...

1718
01:36:39,955 --> 01:36:41,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody, please, anybody.

1719
01:36:41,476 --> 01:36:42,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the end of the mailbag?

1720
01:36:42,437 --> 01:36:43,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I told you.

1721
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's close the mailbag and get back into the news, please.

1722
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I blame Chris and Marissa for making me cry for the first time.

1723
01:36:48,442 --> 01:36:49,542
[SPEAKER_04]: We are running so long this segment.

1724
01:36:49,562 --> 01:36:49,963
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

1725
01:36:49,983 --> 01:36:52,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, baby, any time.

1726
01:36:52,345 --> 01:36:54,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Clawed is not Gaming Steve.

1727
01:36:54,126 --> 01:36:55,147
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Scott's issue.

1728
01:36:56,007 --> 01:36:57,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know Gaming Steve.

1729
01:36:57,969 --> 01:37:08,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so speaking of idiotic, there's a brand new channel added to the Wii this week called Everybody Votes, which is not true because not everybody does vote.

1730
01:37:09,736 --> 01:37:19,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Should be locked out for... So, yeah, the Everybody Votes channel, and you get to vote on such wonderful topics like, what's better, dogs or cats?

1731
01:37:19,944 --> 01:37:20,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Woohoo!

1732
01:37:21,745 --> 01:37:22,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, that's fun.

1733
01:37:22,986 --> 01:37:38,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Worth my Wii to be flashing, by the way, and it's still flashing because I have not turned it on since this stupid channel came out, but apparently you can vote on these, you find out the results, and then it gets, you know,

1734
01:37:39,184 --> 01:37:42,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Logged into your profile to how many you got right versus how many you got wrong.

1735
01:37:43,006 --> 01:37:46,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess you can show people your wee penis.

1736
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:50,270
[SPEAKER_11]: To be honest, I wish this channel was Everybody Poops because that would be a lot better.

1737
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:50,970
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be true.

1738
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:53,051
[SPEAKER_04]: But should that be a question?

1739
01:37:53,471 --> 01:37:55,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Which do you prefer more in the bathroom, one or two?

1740
01:37:58,174 --> 01:37:59,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with two, you can read.

1741
01:37:59,975 --> 01:38:02,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one, you're... Anyway, this is disgusting.

1742
01:38:03,596 --> 01:38:05,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually think the channel is really cute.

1743
01:38:06,378 --> 01:38:07,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have a problem with it.

1744
01:38:07,178 --> 01:38:08,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's... You know, it's not...

1745
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:14,314
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the perfect kind of... Nintendo did not make any fanfare out of it.

1746
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:17,237
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably just something that used to be a tech demo.

1747
01:38:17,738 --> 01:38:19,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're going to be seeing a lot of crap like this.

1748
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,843
[SPEAKER_04]: But Nintendo did not try to sell this to anyone.

1749
01:38:21,863 --> 01:38:24,526
[SPEAKER_04]: They did not try to put it out like, by the week, because we had the Everyone Votes channel.

1750
01:38:24,546 --> 01:38:27,769
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was just like, hey, we're just going to put this up because we're bored.

1751
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:30,813
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put up this Everyone Votes channel just because we have it, and here it is.

1752
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,621
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1753
01:38:51,135 --> 01:38:52,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's a bad thing.

1754
01:38:52,195 --> 01:38:52,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's cute.

1755
01:39:20,714 --> 01:39:22,915
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't any kittens left because of all the masturbating.

1756
01:39:23,235 --> 01:39:23,575
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why.

1757
01:39:25,335 --> 01:39:25,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

1758
01:39:25,695 --> 01:39:28,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well there you go.

1759
01:39:29,016 --> 01:39:30,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anybody else try the voting channel?

1760
01:39:31,597 --> 01:39:33,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched Extra for Do It last night.

1761
01:39:33,517 --> 01:39:36,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it cute though?

1762
01:39:36,498 --> 01:39:37,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the channel was cute.

1763
01:39:38,078 --> 01:39:41,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate the entire world because cats are more awesome.

1764
01:39:42,039 --> 01:39:46,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I believe it was Switzerland where cats outrank dogs.

1765
01:39:46,741 --> 01:39:47,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's all move to Switzerland.

1766
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:47,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Norway.

1767
01:39:48,496 --> 01:39:50,117
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a Norway listener in chat tonight.

1768
01:39:50,197 --> 01:39:51,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I love our Norwegian listener.

1769
01:39:52,377 --> 01:39:55,519
[SPEAKER_04]: So Olaf, we need to get Olaf the Viking a cat.

1770
01:39:57,059 --> 01:40:00,681
[SPEAKER_09]: I want pictures of, never mind, that's a Doctor Who reference.

1771
01:40:00,741 --> 01:40:01,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, sorry.

1772
01:40:02,141 --> 01:40:06,523
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so go vote if you want on your Wii right now.

1773
01:40:06,903 --> 01:40:10,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing you can do on your Wii right now is download Kid Icarus.

1774
01:40:10,484 --> 01:40:14,786
[SPEAKER_04]: But you should know that some of the codes that you may remember from your childhood, they don't work.

1775
01:40:15,242 --> 01:40:20,384
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to put in Icarus fights Medusa Angels, that code is not going to work.

1776
01:40:20,665 --> 01:40:22,465
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a warning before you download it.

1777
01:40:22,505 --> 01:40:25,847
[SPEAKER_04]: It says the original kit Icarus used allows players to use secret passwords.

1778
01:40:26,147 --> 01:40:28,048
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Virtual Console does not support these passwords.

1779
01:40:28,268 --> 01:40:31,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And at first I thought that meant passwords weren't going to work at all.

1780
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:32,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not true.

1781
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:38,373
[SPEAKER_04]: You still can use the old, you know, little jumble 0080C whatever type passwords.

1782
01:40:39,126 --> 01:40:46,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the secret ones won't work because apparently the original cartridge had an included module in it to process the special codes.

1783
01:40:46,828 --> 01:40:47,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I never realized that.

1784
01:40:48,869 --> 01:40:52,170
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't the emulators emulate those codes?

1785
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:54,650
[SPEAKER_04]: So that seems so weird to me.

1786
01:40:54,750 --> 01:41:02,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you play this on Nesticle or whatever those NES emulators are you use, can't you use those codes?

1787
01:41:03,653 --> 01:41:03,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1788
01:41:04,253 --> 01:41:05,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't get it.

1789
01:41:07,482 --> 01:41:09,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, because they're lazy?

1790
01:41:09,243 --> 01:41:10,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know enough about hardware, I guess.

1791
01:41:10,704 --> 01:41:16,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're too busy working on everybody votes to, I don't know, fix their virtual console stuff?

1792
01:41:16,126 --> 01:41:22,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think, everybody votes was already done in some capacity, I think, as some type of, like, demonstration.

1793
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:23,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, it's not that.

1794
01:41:23,790 --> 01:41:27,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about, you know, um, this, this thing here.

1795
01:41:28,312 --> 01:41:33,455
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but really, maybe it was just done so that people would have to see how fucking hard Kid Icarus really was.

1796
01:41:34,312 --> 01:41:37,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of y'all forgot, because you used to use those passwords to just beat the game.

1797
01:41:38,255 --> 01:41:39,797
[SPEAKER_04]: But Kid Icarus is fucking hard.

1798
01:41:40,137 --> 01:41:41,158
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, but it's awesome.

1799
01:41:41,598 --> 01:41:41,838
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1800
01:41:41,978 --> 01:41:42,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely worth your time.

1801
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:44,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that game.

1802
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:46,042
[SPEAKER_09]: It's worth five bucks.

1803
01:41:46,122 --> 01:41:47,703
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll never get a sequel!

1804
01:41:48,063 --> 01:41:48,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Never!

1805
01:41:49,745 --> 01:41:50,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, I hate you.

1806
01:41:52,647 --> 01:41:57,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking of the Virtual Console, we do actually have some other news.

1807
01:41:57,331 --> 01:42:03,175
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a few of the Japan-only games that are going to be coming onto the US Virtual Console.

1808
01:42:03,215 --> 01:42:03,836
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.

1809
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:21,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's actually, um, with a conversation with Nintendo of America, uh, Senior VP George Harrison, they, um, are looking into bringing some of the more successful Japanese franchises that have that cult following in the U.S., um, on the Virtual Console.

1810
01:42:21,234 --> 01:42:24,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, those of us who are the niche gamers, they love us.

1811
01:42:24,935 --> 01:42:26,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo loves us!

1812
01:42:27,056 --> 01:42:27,576
[SPEAKER_09]: That's proof.

1813
01:42:28,276 --> 01:42:32,738
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're talking about, um, bringing over some of the games if they can have them translated properly.

1814
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:36,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but if they really loved us, they would have made the fucking thing region-free.

1815
01:42:37,245 --> 01:42:37,465
[SPEAKER_09]: True.

1816
01:42:38,366 --> 01:42:41,249
[SPEAKER_09]: However, they still haven't given me Guardian Legend!

1817
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:42,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Bastards.

1818
01:42:43,752 --> 01:42:47,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Guardian Legend is that game we will always bitch about that we will never get on Virtual Console.

1819
01:42:47,736 --> 01:42:52,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Guardian Legend is the... Actually... Greatest 8-bit game ever made, that's all that needs to be said.

1820
01:42:52,521 --> 01:42:55,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's followed by the greatest 16-bit game ever made.

1821
01:42:56,457 --> 01:42:57,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Run to a blood!

1822
01:42:58,278 --> 01:43:03,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think about, wasn't the MSX announced as one of the systems they were going to emulate in Japan on Virtual Console?

1823
01:43:03,601 --> 01:43:08,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe so, because if we get an MSX emulator on here, do you know what that means we get?

1824
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal fucking gear.

1825
01:43:09,805 --> 01:43:10,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-uh.

1826
01:43:10,565 --> 01:43:12,166
[SPEAKER_09]: The real sequel to Metal Gear 2.

1827
01:43:12,206 --> 01:43:12,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude.

1828
01:43:14,033 --> 01:43:15,874
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it right there.

1829
01:43:15,974 --> 01:43:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want.

1830
01:43:16,954 --> 01:43:19,355
[SPEAKER_04]: You write that right under Guardian Legend on the wish list.

1831
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:22,016
[SPEAKER_09]: On MSX, there were two Guardian Legend games.

1832
01:43:22,316 --> 01:43:27,318
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be on the same list of, yeah, sure, we'll implement online before we implement this shit.

1833
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:29,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you, I hate you.

1834
01:43:29,759 --> 01:43:32,160
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the MSX, there actually were two Guardian Legend games.

1835
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,080
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Guardia.

1836
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard of Guardia.

1837
01:43:35,381 --> 01:43:36,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never played it, but that would be hot.

1838
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:45,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a photograph of it once that my MSX emulator wouldn't run, so I was so upset.

1839
01:43:48,573 --> 01:43:59,697
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure that everyone's going to be... Well, I don't know if anyone's really going to be interested in this, but apparently they're putting out Brunswick Pro Bowling for Nintendo Wii, the PlayStation 2, and PSP.

1840
01:44:01,358 --> 01:44:02,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, ask yourself.

1841
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,020
[SPEAKER_11]: When ever...

1842
01:44:07,191 --> 01:44:13,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Ever, other than Wii Bowling, has there ever been a good bowling game on any console?

1843
01:44:13,212 --> 01:44:14,173
[SPEAKER_12]: You just said it.

1844
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:15,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Wii Bowling.

1845
01:44:15,433 --> 01:44:16,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Other than Wii Bowling.

1846
01:44:16,533 --> 01:44:18,134
[SPEAKER_08]: The Tekken bowling game on Tekken.

1847
01:44:18,654 --> 01:44:19,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, shush.

1848
01:44:20,574 --> 01:44:21,354
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.

1849
01:44:22,054 --> 01:44:23,015
[SPEAKER_04]: For three seconds.

1850
01:44:24,095 --> 01:44:28,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I be really lame and not console-oriented and say that Elf Bowling was awesome?

1851
01:44:30,054 --> 01:44:31,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Wee!

1852
01:44:31,915 --> 01:44:35,618
[SPEAKER_04]: How about... What's the one they had at the Metreon years ago?

1853
01:44:35,718 --> 01:44:37,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Bowling or whatever that thing was for you.

1854
01:44:37,519 --> 01:44:38,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Mega Touch Bowling.

1855
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,961
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that wasn't at Metreon.

1856
01:44:39,981 --> 01:44:42,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That was at... Dave & Buster's has it too.

1857
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:43,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave & Buster's with the giant screen.

1858
01:44:43,943 --> 01:44:44,804
[SPEAKER_04]: They had it at the Metreon too.

1859
01:44:44,864 --> 01:44:45,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this.

1860
01:44:45,745 --> 01:44:46,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we played it there.

1861
01:44:46,565 --> 01:44:48,306
[SPEAKER_09]: And Neo Geo Bowling, Ryoma says.

1862
01:44:48,647 --> 01:44:48,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1863
01:44:49,527 --> 01:44:50,348
[SPEAKER_09]: And Clubhouse Games.

1864
01:44:50,508 --> 01:44:50,588
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

1865
01:44:50,899 --> 01:44:55,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody loves Wii Bowling, somebody said, let's turn this into an actual full-fledged game.

1866
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's great.

1867
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's charge something that you can get, I don't know, for free.

1868
01:44:58,621 --> 01:44:59,821
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a pinball game called Nine Pin.

1869
01:45:01,481 --> 01:45:05,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's just make another game that's exactly the same as the last one and charge you money for it.

1870
01:45:05,802 --> 01:45:08,242
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's okay because it runs with Pro Bowling.

1871
01:45:08,282 --> 01:45:11,483
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure, to be honest, when it does come out, it'll be like $20.

1872
01:45:12,623 --> 01:45:15,484
[SPEAKER_11]: So who gives a shit?

1873
01:45:15,524 --> 01:45:16,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's going to be cheap.

1874
01:45:17,204 --> 01:45:19,905
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, God crave.

1875
01:45:20,365 --> 01:45:20,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

1876
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:22,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1877
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:23,531
[SPEAKER_11]: The last, what was it?

1878
01:45:23,551 --> 01:45:30,595
[SPEAKER_11]: The last, they had like some, I want to say, Extreme Bowling 2006 that came out last year.

1879
01:45:31,256 --> 01:45:33,117
[SPEAKER_11]: It was uber lame, by the way.

1880
01:45:33,597 --> 01:45:46,786
[SPEAKER_11]: So, hopefully, they will go with, you know, the same kind of gameplay as Wii Bowling, but somehow I think they're going to fuck it up because they always fuck it up.

1881
01:45:46,826 --> 01:45:47,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Comments from chat.

1882
01:45:47,646 --> 01:45:49,788
[SPEAKER_04]: James Patrick says, Elf Bowling, shooter.

1883
01:45:50,468 --> 01:45:50,888
[SPEAKER_04]: TJ and I...

1884
01:45:52,543 --> 01:45:54,905
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Janai says, Elf Bowling is more fun if you're drunk.

1885
01:45:56,327 --> 01:45:58,009
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Dark Knight says, Simpsons Bowling.

1886
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:01,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Alpha Canogram agrees, Tekken Bowling.

1887
01:46:01,712 --> 01:46:04,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming Nerd says, let's throw our Wiimotes directly into our TVs and break them.

1888
01:46:04,915 --> 01:46:06,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, I thought I was holding a bowling ball.

1889
01:46:08,119 --> 01:46:11,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, what I do want is a new baseball game for the Wii.

1890
01:46:11,822 --> 01:46:13,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tiger Claw remembers.

1891
01:46:13,772 --> 01:46:15,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, what about Hyper Bowling?

1892
01:46:15,754 --> 01:46:17,715
[SPEAKER_04]: It came with Microsoft Plus for the XP.

1893
01:46:18,075 --> 01:46:18,496
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was.

1894
01:46:18,516 --> 01:46:19,477
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called Hyper Bowling.

1895
01:46:19,517 --> 01:46:20,617
[SPEAKER_04]: But you actually had a bowling ball.

1896
01:46:20,738 --> 01:46:23,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that was the version of it that they had in the arcades.

1897
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:24,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Hyper Bowling, but with like an actual ball that you roll.

1898
01:46:25,001 --> 01:46:25,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, forget it.

1899
01:46:28,404 --> 01:46:30,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I was excited that Tigerclaw reminded me of the name of that.

1900
01:46:32,947 --> 01:46:34,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it or any more stories?

1901
01:46:34,408 --> 01:46:34,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

1902
01:46:34,668 --> 01:46:35,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Next story is mine.

1903
01:46:35,369 --> 01:46:36,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops, my bad.

1904
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:37,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Haha, fail.

1905
01:46:38,632 --> 01:46:41,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to do with one of my very favorite countries.

1906
01:46:41,194 --> 01:46:42,835
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other country I've really been to.

1907
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:43,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.

1908
01:46:43,854 --> 01:46:45,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the Caribbean when I was seven, but that doesn't count.

1909
01:46:46,095 --> 01:46:47,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only other country I've really been to is Canada.

1910
01:46:48,356 --> 01:46:56,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And Canada, you know, even though we have a lot of Canadian listeners, things are kind of quiet gaming-wise in Canada.

1911
01:46:56,300 --> 01:47:03,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sure, you've got some of the game studios in Toronto, Vancouver, but for the most part, you don't hear a whole lot of big gaming news coming out of Canada.

1912
01:47:03,703 --> 01:47:04,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now, guess what?

1913
01:47:04,564 --> 01:47:11,507
[SPEAKER_04]: ESA has their sights set on Canada because apparently Canada has pirates galore.

1914
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:15,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, pirates!

1915
01:47:37,737 --> 01:47:44,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're saying that Canada has failed to deliver on promises of more stringent copyright laws and stepped up enforcements for laws already on the books.

1916
01:47:44,938 --> 01:47:55,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, Canada remains far behind virtually all of its peers in the industrialized world with respect to its efforts to bring its copyright laws up to date with realities of the global digital networked environment.

1917
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:00,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed, even the major developing countries have progressed further and faster than Canada in meeting the challenge.

1918
01:48:01,261 --> 01:48:04,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Insert mandatory playing Canada joke here.

1919
01:48:05,022 --> 01:48:05,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Ace.

1920
01:48:06,471 --> 01:48:10,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say from personal experience, all my Canadian friends love Warcraft, but then again, who doesn't?

1921
01:48:10,773 --> 01:48:11,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And pot.

1922
01:48:11,674 --> 01:48:13,795
[SPEAKER_01]: And preferably at the same time.

1923
01:48:14,455 --> 01:48:16,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Which really confused me.

1924
01:48:17,717 --> 01:48:19,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does a Canadian pirate look like?

1925
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1926
01:48:24,641 --> 01:48:26,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Sparrow that kind of smells like maple?

1927
01:48:26,482 --> 01:48:27,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1928
01:48:27,923 --> 01:48:31,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I have this image of a bobsled that looks like a ship with a sail on it and dogs.

1929
01:48:33,326 --> 01:48:34,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Arr, mush.

1930
01:48:34,867 --> 01:48:34,947
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1931
01:48:34,987 --> 01:48:35,107
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1932
01:48:35,973 --> 01:48:37,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to Canada later this year.

1933
01:48:38,654 --> 01:48:39,114
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

1934
01:48:39,234 --> 01:48:39,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada's a fun place.

1935
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:41,534
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to find me a Canadian pirate.

1936
01:48:44,015 --> 01:48:45,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he'll find your booty?

1937
01:48:47,156 --> 01:48:48,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

1938
01:48:48,616 --> 01:48:52,117
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck is a ferret?

1939
01:48:54,358 --> 01:48:55,338
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bad joke.

1940
01:48:55,358 --> 01:48:56,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I'll hit myself with Kirby.

1941
01:48:56,278 --> 01:48:56,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't

1942
01:48:59,130 --> 01:48:59,750
[SPEAKER_09]: DNL's Kirby?

1943
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:00,711
[SPEAKER_04]: It's DNL's Kirby.

1944
01:49:00,731 --> 01:49:01,512
[SPEAKER_04]: She needs to come get it.

1945
01:49:01,532 --> 01:49:03,133
[SPEAKER_09]: DNL, you need to come get your Kirby.

1946
01:49:03,393 --> 01:49:08,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm getting my coobies all over this Kirby that DMN brought on my nipple.

1947
01:49:08,716 --> 01:49:09,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

1948
01:49:09,057 --> 01:49:09,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

1949
01:49:09,397 --> 01:49:09,797
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1950
01:49:10,858 --> 01:49:12,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for you, Renee.

1951
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:13,500
[SPEAKER_09]: He's sexing it up for you.

1952
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:17,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I have news that's better than blaming Canada for shit.

1953
01:49:17,502 --> 01:49:17,802
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1954
01:49:18,083 --> 01:49:19,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, it's not really all that exciting.

1955
01:49:20,244 --> 01:49:27,789
[SPEAKER_09]: But DirecTV has something called Game Lounge now, and it's this interactive channel for family stuff that you play through your satellite box.

1956
01:49:27,869 --> 01:49:28,750
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like,

1957
01:49:29,464 --> 01:49:30,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox Live Suck Edition.

1958
01:49:31,466 --> 01:49:35,229
[SPEAKER_09]: It has games that are based on kids shows like Spongebob.

1959
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:41,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has competitive games where you can compete for prizes and money.

1960
01:49:42,655 --> 01:49:47,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And you should check it out, I guess, if you are into family games.

1961
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:50,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I like for my games to have blood and sex.

1962
01:49:50,282 --> 01:49:51,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming Lounge?

1963
01:49:51,723 --> 01:49:52,884
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Game Lounge.

1964
01:49:52,904 --> 01:49:53,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Lounge.

1965
01:49:53,384 --> 01:49:54,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Orange Lounge taken?

1966
01:49:55,666 --> 01:49:56,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I guess it was.

1967
01:49:57,028 --> 01:49:57,848
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1968
01:50:28,413 --> 01:50:30,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, I have this really great idea.

1969
01:50:30,394 --> 01:50:30,814
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1970
01:50:32,134 --> 01:50:32,614
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

1971
01:50:32,674 --> 01:50:33,555
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it right there.

1972
01:50:34,015 --> 01:50:35,095
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the recreation.

1973
01:50:38,516 --> 01:50:39,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Shot down again by Jamie.

1974
01:50:41,397 --> 01:50:41,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

1975
01:50:42,137 --> 01:50:42,337
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1976
01:50:42,577 --> 01:50:42,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Heart!

1977
01:50:44,338 --> 01:50:44,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1978
01:50:47,339 --> 01:50:48,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1979
01:50:49,499 --> 01:50:51,240
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone very long this segment.

1980
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:51,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost two hours.

1981
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa, can you believe this show is only half over?

1982
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,841
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is torture, then chain me to the wall.

1983
01:51:00,902 --> 01:51:02,743
[SPEAKER_11]: But the listeners like it when it's long.

1984
01:51:03,464 --> 01:51:05,965
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys like it long, don't you?

1985
01:51:06,706 --> 01:51:07,706
[SPEAKER_04]: You like it long.

1986
01:51:08,127 --> 01:51:08,407
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1987
01:51:08,707 --> 01:51:14,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio with Part B of our show.

1988
01:51:15,992 --> 01:51:20,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1989
01:51:21,435 --> 01:51:25,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
