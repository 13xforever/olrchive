2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, February 25th, 2007, plenty of new games from Virtual Console are discovered,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
some Xbox 360 games are getting a price cut,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and one TV station warns us about sexual predators on online games.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange, Lounge, Radio.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Today is February 25th, 2007. We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, the gaming lifestyle.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you play games online, you might see me post on forums.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Not joining us tonight, sadly, is Dark Sakura, also known as Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
She had some prior family engagements to attend to.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We will be hearing from her in a special pre-taped segment later in the show,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but we've secretly replaced Dark Sakura with a furry gay man tonight.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Say hello to Eddie.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm Yummy.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, Casper the Gay. Am I supposed to refer to you as Casper the Gay?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, pretty much. No, it's alright. I don't care.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, how are you doing, Casper?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm great. I came down here having a good time.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You remember those old commercials that's like, we secretly replaced so-and-so's Folgers with the new DeCap.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't know what the hell it is.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I feel like we secretly replaced Jamie with a furry gay man.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And they'll never know.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alright, well, also joining us tonight, the one and only tech master, Loki.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And we did not replace him with a furry gay man.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Thank God.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Or did we?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, we didn't.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Alright, how are you doing, Loki?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm doing fine.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Good, good to hear. I'm glad to see you're eating healthy tonight with the old Mickey D's.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You know, their sweet and sour sauce tastes like it's been sitting out for a long time.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It tastes a little off.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But that does not mean that I'm not gonna, you know, and I'm also disappointed that I only got two packets of sweet and sour sauce versus three, because three's a lot better.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Doesn't McDonald's have some stupid policy, like if you order yay so many nuggets?

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, but ten pieces, I'm supposed to get three.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They fucking jit me.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why don't you go in and ask to speak with the manager?

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Because I don't care.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You should be one of those people.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sure anybody in our chat room who's worked for fast food in the past has some story about some fucking bitch who came in there because they wanted extra sauce or, you know, oh, you gotta let the people to drive through who order like,

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I want a super-sized burger, chicken McNuggets, super-sized fries, oh, and a Diet Coke.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Or even better, I want a six-piece McNugget with 12 sides of sweet and sour sauce.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right, it makes me angsty.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Makes me angsty.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
God damn it, that's the second week in a row that's happened.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's more than a second week in a row.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's been like four weeks in a row.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I've been doing it on purpose.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All right.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Say hello as well tonight to, uh...

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Murder!

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Say hello to Rice Princess.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How you doing, Rice Princess?

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now's when you're supposed to cue one wing angel when I come...

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's all right.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How you doing, Rice Princess?

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm doing pretty good.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm eating McDonald's, too.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Very healthy.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm eating McDonald's, too.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is this loud enough?

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, see?

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now, tonight I'm letting you see the monitor so you can see when you're loud enough.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Can I have a not-crappy mic to talk into?

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because I hate yelling and making it sound like I'm falling off a cliff.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All right.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How you doing, though, otherwise?

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Pretty good.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yep.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
All right.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, also say hello to our chat room.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Always another guest here on the program.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hello, I am the chat room.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I noticed Tiger Claw in chat room says,

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Sky, you do know the Oscars are on?

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yep.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, last week it was the Grammys, or two weeks ago it was the Grammys.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This week it's the Oscars.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We just can't win.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We're always up against something.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I mean, but come on.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Who cares?

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're going to be able to read it tomorrow morning who won the Oscars.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And let's be honest.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You and I both know most people listen to this show in the audio archive or podcast form.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And they can listen to that in the convenience of whenever they want.

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So it won't be up against the Oscars in that regard.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So we have to just keep doing a show like always.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Because if you want, I mean, if you don't want us to talk about video games,

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
we could just kind of like turn on the Oscars and just give live commentary.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
God Kate Winslet looks fat.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Wouldn't that be fun?

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I did see a deal.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will say Oscar chat real fast even though, you know,

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
we're supposed to be keeping the random down tonight.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I will say I saw that in Notes on a Scandal,

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
which is the one that Judi Dench is nominated for.

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I went out and saw that last night.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's pretty good.

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Pretty good.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Judi Dench plays a good, crazy old woman.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
She really does.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I hope she wins.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But I hear that I didn't see the queen.

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I hear that was really good too.

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But Judi Dench, has she ever been bad in any movie?

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't think she has.

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Nope.

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't think she has.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
All right.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Joshi16 in the chat room has some harsh words for the podcast listeners.

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He said podcast equals lazy fans.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ouch.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ouch.

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Burn.

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
All right.

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, let's get right into how we always start off the show,

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
a little bit of how is your gaming week,

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
where we talk about what we've been playing.

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And usually our chat room gets into it too.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, first off, speaking of chat room, I want to say hi to the new listeners.

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I always make a chance to try to say hi to noobs that are in chat.

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Level 10 noob.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Misty's not a noob.

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She's a long-time listener.

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She's in chat tonight.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She hasn't been there for a long time.

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So hi, Misty.

135
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Frisbee.

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't recognize that name.

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And if I'm mistakenly pegging you as the new listener, I miss you.

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I apologize.

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
My brain can only hold so much.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't recognize Heon64.

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That must be new.

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So welcome.

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Proper T. Roboboy.

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Actually, maybe there's been a Roboboy before.

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't know.

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Roboboy, I don't recognize you.

147
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Noobs or people I'm calling noobs because I didn't recognize your name.

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Welcome to chat.

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We have a lot of folks in chat tonight, a lot of regulars in there.

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We appreciate your support as always.

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But again, if you can't listen to us live because some of you guys have other things

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
to do on Sunday nights like Oscar parties or whatever stupid stuff you're doing,

153
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
you can always download our podcast.

154
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Send us e-mails.

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mailbag and orangeontrader.com.

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Leave us voicemails.

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, I'll shut up.

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
My gaming week was good.

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It was all crackdown.

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,500
It's lots of crackdown and the game is awesome except some co-op, depending on who you're

163
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,000
playing with, I guess, can be very buggy or very laggy.

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Like, I played a co-op game with Jeremy Todd 1 today and yeah, it was pretty bad.

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Like, I couldn't even move around and stuff.

166
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It was that laggy.

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But, and then again, I played another co-op game earlier in the week with Da Money.

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't remember the rest of the name on there, but that was pretty cool.

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And that was pretty fun because we were car surfing in that.

170
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I stood on top of his car and he was driving really fast and I was firing rockets at other

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
cars coming by and it was hilarious.

172
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Couldn't stop laughing.

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So, that's pretty fun.

174
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But the game itself is just really keeping my attention.

175
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm hoping for some good download content later on because I think once I do finish

176
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the game and finally do get the rest of the achievements, it might just kind of crash

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
for me because you need to have some really good co-op stuff to be able to get a lot out

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
of the game.

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But, it's fun so far though.

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I love it.

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then, of course, you know, the typical Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and I got a second

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
PSP that I'm fixing.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's all fixed now, but I have to order a new faceplate button for it because I bought

184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
this third-party faceplate for it and it sucks balls.

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So, I always stick with first-party stuff because the third-party clear ones, they suck.

186
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think that's all I've really played other than, you know, just Crackdown.

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So, yeah, kind of slow.

188
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, Crackdown is what a lot of people have been playing.

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I haven't signed on to the Xbox a lot this week because I've been playing a lot of World

190
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
of Warcraft, but I have noticed a lot of people on my friends list have been playing Crackdown

191
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
because I actually do sign on the web to check my messages.

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like, you know, if I'm, you know, just because I get messages from listeners once in a while

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
like, hey, how come you're only playing shitty games or hey, how come I haven't seen you

194
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
in a while?

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So, I'll write.

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
As long as it's text messages.

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If I get voice messages, it's harder to check those online.

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But, I do respond to all of them as I get them.

199
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think from what I've been reading and what I've experienced so far, the co-op is broken

200
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
a little bit on Crackdown.

201
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You can't invite people.

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can open your game up and then they can join it, but the inviting is broken.

203
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So that's supposed to be fixed in a later patch.

204
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So, when are you going to let me play Crackdown so I can decide if it's worth the 60 bucks

205
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
or not?

206
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, I still want to play it.

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
All right.

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, you're going to come over at some point and show it to me, right?

209
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I had it here today.

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I didn't get the demo, quote unquote.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I didn't get it.

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Like, I suck at those types of games.

213
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, maybe you can see my save game where you can fire homing missiles at people.

214
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
All right.

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's see, what else?

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's if you're a GamingWig?

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's it.

218
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
GamingWig was mostly World of War crack, as I said, Kid Icarus a lot on Nintendo.

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Dude, that game, it's awesome.

220
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's hard as hell, but it's fun.

221
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's the hardest game ever.

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Dude, when I beat the first dungeon this week, I thought I was the shit because I'm like,

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
oh my gosh, I'm over 21 and I can still beat the first dungeon.

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I still have some skill at this game.

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

226
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It was like getting to hear the theme.

227
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
How many people have actually heard other music in the game besides the very first stage?

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Not a lot.

229
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Exactly.

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Most people have only heard the first stage music, so it's kind of neat to hear the second

231
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
stage theme.

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Anyway, I'm sure there's a lot of listeners, though, that are like, I already beat the

233
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
game, Rob.

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's taking you so long?

235
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, I'm nine years old and I beat the game like 500 times.

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Dude, when I was nine years old, I beat the game 500 times, too.

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Shut up.

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But also, I used Icarus Fights Medusa Angels.

239
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Anyway, also, I went to the arcade this week, which was kind of cool because I had a date

240
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Friday, and he actually wanted to go to the arcade because we didn't really have a set

241
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
plan, but he's kind of got a dorky side to him, so he had suggested we go to the arcade.

242
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Dude, he made me play seven games of DDR.

243
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It was awesome.

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We played seven games of DDR.

245
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm having a whole new respect for DDR Supernova, which I have yet to really have played a whole

246
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
lot of, which is cool.

247
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then I played DDR Disney Mix, a lot of dumb stuff.

248
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But then we played some old school games I haven't played forever, like Soul Calibur 2.

249
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I played Soul Calibur 2, and first off, Young Sung is awesome.

250
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Usually, I play female characters in games because they're better in fighting games.

251
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
They're more agile, usually.

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But Young Sung is the best character in Soul Calibur, hands down.

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I made it all the way to the boss, so I know that machine was set on easy because I suck

254
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
at Soul Calibur.

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're like, what's going on?

256
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's exactly what I said.

257
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I kept winning, and I looked at my date and I said, I don't know why I keep winning.

258
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're just standing there the whole time.

260
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're not even pushing any buttons.

261
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm really sorry that I'm winning.

262
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hey, what's going on?

263
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No, to answer chat, I do not have a boyfriend.

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I think he listens to this once in a while.

265
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I went on a date.

266
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There's a big difference.

267
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh, God.

268
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Anyway, I shouldn't talk about my personal life on this program.

269
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah, you should.

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I really shouldn't.

271
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, I played Mario Kart Arcade, which was fun, because they fixed their machine at Golf

272
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Land, and now the picture camera thing works again.

273
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's a lot of fun.

274
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I actually won the race.

275
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm getting good at Mario Kart Arcade.

276
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That must be on easy, too.

277
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No, we played a normal track.

278
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We didn't play the easiest one.

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We played on normal.

280
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
True.

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No, I swear.

282
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That game's a waste of money, man.

283
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's kind of hokey.

284
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Mario Kart in the arcade does not nearly have the same magic as it does at home.

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Why don't you just take a picture of yourself and tape it to the screen if you really want

286
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
your face on the thing?

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It would be better if you had eight of those machines.

288
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Then it would be better with the pictures.

289
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I could see Dave and Busters having all these machines next to each other.

290
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
In fact, I bet there's a Dave and Buster somewhere that has it.

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But when you only have two, it is kind of hokey.

292
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And the game itself is not the same magic as the home.

293
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's really not.

294
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's like a whole different engine or something.

295
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If you want to see the Mario Kart Arcade, by the way, search for Orange Lounge on YouTube,

296
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and there's a video of Loki playing Mario Kart drunk.

297
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's hilarious.

298
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
At his bachelor party.

299
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Awesome.

300
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah.

301
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We need to put more crap on YouTube.

302
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Eddie, you're a camera person, right?

303
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah, I have a digital camera where we can download stuff.

304
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah.

305
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Just took it up to the USB.

306
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You need to do video.

307
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You need to be like our official Orange Lounge videographer.

308
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Seriously, yeah.

309
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's what I'll do.

310
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That'll be rad.

311
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's do that.

312
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's on.

313
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
All right.

314
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's on.

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
All right.

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Anyhow, let's go around and figure out some other gaming weeks.

317
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

318
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, more wow.

319
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yep.

320
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Good times on there.

321
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh, I'm so happy because like my 29 Rogue on Elder Thallus, I got some poor sap to give

322
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
me a plus 15 agi on my dagger.

323
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's kind of expensive.

324
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Did you just call it agi?

325
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Agility.

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's agility.

327
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Agility.

328
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I call it agi.

329
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Agi is how you abbreviate it.

330
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's like me saying-

331
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Agi is going to be a punch in your face.

332
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, Rice Princess, you make me lull.

333
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh, Rob.

334
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Deaf, please.

335
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Please.

336
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Rob, I've got to heal it in.

337
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Rolled full of mao.

338
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Rolled full of mao.

339
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
JK.

340
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Anyway.

341
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh my gosh.

342
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Now I'm going to leave.

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No, but yeah, it's pretty much been wow.

344
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Whoop dee doo.

345
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Good wow times.

346
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I played for about, I don't know, like an hour, hour and a half on Back Me Wool, and

347
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I did two quests.

348
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't even know why I went on.

349
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm like, man.

350
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And they were in the Barrens, so you know how you could do like 10 quests at the same

351
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
time in the Barrens?

352
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm like, I'll just not do anything.

353
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Because you got tied up in Barrens Chat?

354
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No, I got tied up in G Chat, yo.

355
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

356
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Guild Chat.

357
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's not abbreviate that.

358
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes, please.

359
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Thank you.

360
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah.

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Guild Chat.

362
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Sorry.

363
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So, yeah.

364
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Did you actually sign on to the Guild and go, what up, G?

365
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No.

366
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No, just curious.

367
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Eddie, how was your gaming week?

368
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It was awesome.

369
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've been doing the virtual console thing too, so I got Donkey Kong Country.

370
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh my god, that game still kicks ass.

371
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I love that game.

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah, but it's not as good because I have GameCube controllers for my Wii instead of

373
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the classic controllers, and that doesn't work.

374
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But it's still fun.

375
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Like, because you can't run and jump at the same time because of the way that the X and

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the B buttons are positioned on the GameCube controller.

377
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So, it's still awesome, though.

378
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Like, nobody else cares, though.

379
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, we don't.

380
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But yeah, I also got Kid Icarus, and that game is the hardest game I've ever played

381
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
in like 27 years of video gaming.

382
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's ridiculous.

383
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm trying to think of games that are harder than Kid Icarus.

384
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Battletoads, if they ever put Battletoads.

385
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Battletoads, oh my god, I love that game.

386
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That is great.

387
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Virtual console, you are fucked.

388
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No, I love, because you can attack your partner.

389
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Because you know that's one of those like two players at the same time, like Contra?

390
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You could like double dragon.

391
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You could attack your friend.

392
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah.

393
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's awesome.

394
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Totally.

395
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Rygar is pretty hard.

396
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I love Rygar.

397
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So do I.

398
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But it's hard.

399
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Like, try getting to the last boss without a fucking game genie code or something.

400
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If you have a normal NES.

401
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Wasn't Rygar so hard because you couldn't save it, or you couldn't, like you had to

402
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
beat it one city?

403
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't think there was a, yeah.

404
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You had to do it.

405
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You had to beat it one city.

406
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And you could only continue I think so many times too.

407
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah.

408
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So, it was pretty hard.

409
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, that's how all games were back in the day though.

410
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, I guess.

411
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Alright.

412
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Uh huh.

413
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm looking at what's going on in chat room.

414
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
JV Mon says, Sky, are you fucking with Rice Princess's volume?

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes, sorry, if you are noticing audio problems, I'm fucking with her volume as she's talking

416
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
because Rice Princess has a naturally quiet voice.

417
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm trying to be loud.

418
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
See, oh man, am I like super loud now?

419
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Like, can two people in China hear me now?

420
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think we're good.

421
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, okay.

422
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But make sure if Loki talks, he uses this mic and not the one you're on.

423
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Okay.

424
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Okay.

425
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Thank you.

426
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Alright.

427
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Because I guess the guys in studio have louder voices anyway, not that you guys want to know

428
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that.

429
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Eddie, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

430
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Nope.

431
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Alright.

432
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's get into some gaming news then.

433
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, first actually, some housekeeping.

434
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
First off, obviously Dark Sakura's not here tonight.

435
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You will be hearing her in a tape segment in part B though.

436
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
She still is joining us for the mailbag, so Dark Sakura fans have that to look forward

437
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to in our B segment.

438
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And also in our B segment tonight, which I'm making the first half of the show sound really

439
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
boring, but an old favorite from OLR comes back tonight.

440
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You asked for it.

441
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Tonight we're going to play some Beat the Host.

442
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Tonight is Beat the Host.

443
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Literally, we're going to be beating Robin Elle.

444
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, can I like punch you in the face?

445
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No, you don't actually Beat the Host.

446
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh, man, dammit.

447
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I know you guys are kind of new to Beat the Host.

448
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Beat the Host is we're changing the format a little bit for Beat the Host tonight, but

449
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
it's basically how well do you know your video game music.

450
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And a listener gets to take on a host of their choosing.

451
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm going to tell you what, if you don't have a knowledge of classic arcade games tonight,

452
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
don't even bother.

453
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay, then don't pick me.

454
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Don't even try tonight because it's going to be killer.

455
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's way harder than any of the others we've done, I think.

456
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There are some that are easy, but some are hard.

457
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We'll get into that in part B.

458
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I was like five years old when the arcade games were popular.

459
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I know, so don't pick me.

460
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, then you better pick Loki, I guess.

461
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He might be the only challenge in here.

462
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
We'll see.

463
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Or you can pick Rice Princess just to embarrass her with her lack of classic arcade knowledge,

464
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
so this will be fun.

465
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
All right, we'll see what happens.

466
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That would suck.

467
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
All right, let's move on and go into some gaming news this week, starting off with some

468
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
virtual console news.

469
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We're going to talk about a new feature that has shown up on the virtual console, but not

470
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
in this country.

471
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's over in the UK.

472
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What's interesting is that a new bonus is now waiting for them on the front page when

473
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
they log in.

474
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's not a very well-hidden secret.

475
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It looks a little text-drawn smiley.

476
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What happens when you go into it, it's the Warp Zone.

477
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's this new area on the Wii called the Nintendo Warp Zone.

478
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What the Warp Zone has is just some trivia and cool stuff.

479
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Right now, what they have on there is some little Kirby trivia.

480
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They have Kirby history and Kirby trivia, which would make sense because obviously the

481
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Kirby game.

482
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Did they get the Kirby game in Europe released on their console yet?

483
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I know we got it here.

484
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm assuming Kirby Europe, if they don't already have it, isn't far behind.

485
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That is kind of opening the potential to having this cool little Nintendo fan niche center

486
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
that is possible to show up on the Wii.

487
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm betting if the UK has it, we're going to get it any day now here in the US.

488
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
They also did a new channel.

489
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They did the Everybody Votes channel.

490
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's last week's news.

491
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah, but they could have that on that too.

492
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You could vote on different Nintendo trivia.

493
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's what a lot of people are saying they should have done with the Everybody Votes

494
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
channels.

495
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
They should have had Nintendo trivia and stuff.

496
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Who do you like better?

497
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Mario, Luigi, that type of thing.

498
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Instead, they decided to waste the whole space of my channel block here.

499
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Granted, I know it's an optional download, but you know what though?

500
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's still retarded.

501
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's just like the news channel.

502
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's retarded too.

503
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And the weather channel.

504
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The weather channel, great.

505
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I get to find out what the weather was at midnight.

506
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like hours ago.

507
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The forecast works fine.

508
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's lame.

509
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's better than nothing.

510
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's better than nothing.

511
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Right?

512
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The music in the forecast channel is off.

513
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Okay.

514
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Obviously, I'm reaching.

515
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
JV Mon says, I use the weather channel.

517
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
GS68 is calling Loki the resident Wii hater.

518
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I think that's not true.

519
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Loki loves his Wii.

520
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Right.

521
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I totally hate my Wii that I bought with tons of games and stuff.

522
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You didn't have to camp out because of distribution, but whatever.

523
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You got on launch day or before.

524
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, you had your Wii like three days before launch.

525
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I remember going over there playing that horrible, horrible Red Steel.

526
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We didn't play Red Steel the first day, but you played at the party and that was awful.

527
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It doesn't matter.

528
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Nobody cares.

529
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
No, it's not okay with players.

530
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No, Red Steel.

531
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a horrible game.

532
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Alright.

533
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Horrible game.

534
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Most person shooters and shooters are though.

535
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
No, just Red Steel because Red Steel sucks balls.

536
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Anyways, one thing that will not suck balls, hopefully,

537
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
is going to be some Neo Geo and MSX games coming to the Virtual Console.

538
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And the first couple titles, at least the MSX titles,

539
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and this is going to be on the Japanese service, of course, for right now,

540
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Eggie and Alest are going to be the first MSX titles

541
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and they're going to be 800 Wii points each.

542
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then both are due out in spring.

543
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Hopefully we'll see some more SNK stuff come over.

544
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Personally, I would hope for Magical Lord and No Metal Slug

545
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
because, my God, how many times do they even read?

546
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, I don't know.

547
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How about Fatal Fury Special,

548
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
one of my favorite fighting games ever next to Street Fighter.

549
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Are you being sarcastic?

550
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No, I fucking love Fatal Fury Special.

551
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I like Fatal Fury.

552
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I like King of Fighters.

553
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Samurai Showdown.

554
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
They need Samurai Showdown because that was great too.

555
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Or the best fucking game on Neo Geo ever,

556
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Magical Drop.

557
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Or King of Monsters, I think.

558
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah, good times.

559
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's very interesting because did they say that at launch

560
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
that they were going to partner with Neo Geo?

561
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't think they did.

562
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I remember hearing about MSX.

563
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I remember MSX, which was very exciting

564
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
because a lot of people were going,

565
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
ooh, now we can get the true sequel to Metal Gear

566
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and all that stuff that was only on the MSX,

567
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
like the Metal Gear 2,

568
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
not that SNK's Revenge stuff we had here in the US.

569
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Or just being able to play the original Metal Gear in the MSX format

570
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
might be kind of interesting.

571
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
They could like retranslate it so that you don't have,

572
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
you know, the truck have started to move.

573
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No, they should keep that in there.

574
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You like that?

575
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah.

576
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
All right.

577
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What were the other translations in that?

578
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm getting sleepy.

579
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I fall asleep or something like that.

580
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, probably.

581
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't know.

582
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Forget it.

583
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So I'm excited.

584
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Any other MSX or Neo Geo games you'd want to see?

585
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm not really familiar with the MSX too much,

586
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
so I don't know.

587
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What was the name of that game,

588
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Blue's Journey or Blue's Adventure or something like that?

589
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Blue's Clues?

590
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
No.

591
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We just figured out Blue's Clues.

592
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We just figured out Blue's Clues.

593
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You can get off the show now.

594
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
No, it was the one where he like had,

595
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
never mind, nobody knows what I'm talking about.

596
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Forget it.

597
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Jerks.

598
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What was I going to say?

599
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What else on Neo Geo?

600
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, as long as we don't get 50,000 clones of Puzzle Bobble,

601
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
like there were in the arcade.

602
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

603
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Like every year there's a new Puzzle Bobble,

604
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and it's always the same damn game.

605
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's the same game every year.

606
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of that,

607
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
even though I love like puzzle games and stuff.

608
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Shadow Charlie wants to see Super Baseball 2020.

609
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Okay.

610
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Rob D wants to see King of Fighters 98.

611
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Hell yeah.

612
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Lots of King of Fighters games too.

613
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
All the King of Fighters games.

614
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But I don't mind seeing new ones of those every year.

615
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah, seriously.

616
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's awesome.

617
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, they need to like keep making them.

618
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Thank you.

619
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Hitstun remembers the translation,

620
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I feel asleep.

621
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It was I feel asleep.

622
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's awesome.

623
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Thank you, Hitstun.

624
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Gold star for you.

625
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yep.

626
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
All right, let's see.

627
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Moving on with some other gaming news.

628
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This, oh my gosh, this makes me so excited.

629
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Square Enix is moving to put their first virtual console title on the Wii in Japan.

630
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes.

631
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And if I tell you Square Enix is putting,

632
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
unless you've already heard this,

633
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
don't guess you've already heard,

634
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
but if I told you Square Enix was putting a game on virtual console,

635
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
what would you think it is?

636
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Square Enix.

637
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like the original Final Fantasy, right?

638
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's what Eddie's saying, Final Fantasy?

639
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, I would agree.

640
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
No, it's even better.

641
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's like one of my favorite Super Nintendo games ever,

642
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
next to Final Fantasy III, VI, whatever you want to say.

643
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh my God, what is it, Rom?

644
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Actraiser.

645
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh my God.

646
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That game's so awesome.

647
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I played that on a ROM, which I don't do because that's illegal,

648
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
but I did play that and that's like a,

649
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
it's like a cross between SimCity and like a side-scroller adventure game.

650
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And sex.

651
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And awesomeness.

652
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Because it's like, no, you know what really makes Actraiser is Yuzo Koshiro.

653
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And music, right?

654
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The music in Actraiser is one of the most phenomenal soundtracks ever, ever.

655
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And for those of you guys that are listening live tonight,

656
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
you're actually going to get a treat during our break.

657
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We can't play it on the podcast because it's copyright,

658
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
but you're going to get Actraiser music during the break tonight

659
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
because I love it that much.

660
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So, Sky, when's that coming out on virtual console?

661
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Well, we don't know yet.

662
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Exactly.

663
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We know it's going to be March in Japan.

664
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So, you know, but that's a good sign that it'll probably make its way over here

665
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
like end of March, April.

666
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That's awesome.

667
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I can't, I'm so downloading this.

668
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Actraiser 2 wasn't even that bad.

669
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's just that they took out the simulation element of the game.

670
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The simulation was fun.

671
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I mean, it was like a Greek, you know,

672
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
you were developing a Greek civilization or whatever.

673
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But Actraiser, seriously,

674
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
the only problem with Actraiser is that you can blast through the game

675
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
in about four hours.

676
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, maybe long.

677
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Maybe just about four hours.

678
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I remember beating it when I rented it in one night.

679
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That's pretty similar to a lot of old games.

680
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I mean, especially NES games.

681
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Like, you could get through them in a couple hours.

682
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, so that's okay.

683
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah, I'm so freaking excited.

684
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That's awesome.

685
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
A lot of folks in chat don't seem to know what Actraiser is in chat.

686
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Highon64, I'm sorry if I mispronounced that,

687
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
says, don't be ashamed, GS68.

688
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't know what Actraiser is either.

689
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Seriously, go online.

690
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Go to Wikipedia and look it up or download the ROM,

691
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
although I didn't tell you to do that.

692
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's awesome.

693
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What's funny is it was in that,

694
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
because in Super Nintendo when they first came out,

695
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
they had like a strategy guide.

696
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It was basically showcasing all the Super Nintendo games

697
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
were going to come out.

698
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And it was in that.

699
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But I don't think it got a lot of coverage and like advertising

700
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and I don't think anybody knew about it.

701
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It was definitely more of a cult game, I think.

702
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I think so, too, because I never played it when I was younger.

703
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Don't see a lot of those games that cross genres.

704
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And that's why Actraiser 2 was kind of forgettable,

705
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
whereas Actraiser 1, you had those, you know,

706
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
side-scrolling action stages like the ghosts and goblins type theme

707
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
with just this most beautiful music you've ever heard in a Super Nintendo game

708
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
mixed with simulation scenes that are so different,

709
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
but they blend in the game so well,

710
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
because you get things in the simulation scene,

711
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
you use in the action scene.

712
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I mean, one of the all-time greatest games.

713
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Seriously.

714
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Okay, am I thinking of the right game

715
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
where you're like an angel and you go and you like...

716
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes, so you can see its little butt.

717
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, pervert, you only you would know that.

718
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You're like, ugh, hot angel butt.

719
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
For the rest of the time you're like a god.

720
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, that's, or like, I don't know.

721
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You're an angel and you're like planning crops or something like that

722
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and you like...

723
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
In the side-scroll, you're a god.

724
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Oh really?

725
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
In the side-scroll is you're a god?

726
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Is that what you said, Eddie?

727
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,440
Is that what you said Eddie? Yes, okay

728
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,000
That's great. I guess I didn't play enough of it. No. Yeah, that was that was a whole theme of the game

729
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,640
You were God. Oh

730
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,340
Yeah, and you had to go down to earth to fix the suffering and it's actually actually like the music

731
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,120
Fits the emotion of the game like so well, I'm sorry

732
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,640
I sound like such a ham, but it's true. Like it's one of the early great like it's so great. Did you cry?

733
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,560
No, not at that. I did cry at a Super Nintendo game though, which one tell me

734
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:06,280
Tell me damn it. Tell me right now. No gonna punch you in your face three Final Fantasy 2. Oh my god

735
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,320
Was it because it was so bad? No, because I beat it and the ending was so great

736
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:18,160
Like finally I need a game in my life. We're getting like 12 years old. Okay. I wasn't like falling I was like

737
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,400
It wasn't like when I saw dancer in the dark the first time

738
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
It was just like a little bit

739
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,360
I'm so sad it's over. Tear tear. All right. Anyway, sorry

740
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,020
Anyways, well if Actraiser isn't your cup of tea, there's gonna be some more stuff coming from Sega

741
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,680
Seriously, I want you to unsubscribe from this show. If Actraiser is not your cup of tea

742
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,500
You do not deserve to listen. No, I'm kidding. Obviously. There goes all of our listeners. Bye guys. It's nice knowing you

743
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,640
Anyways, some new titles from Sega. We're gonna see Sword of a Million

744
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Vectorman, Sonic Spinball, and Beyond Oasis

745
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,680
so those should be coming within the next couple weeks and

746
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,560
There was also some other stuff. I was just reading here last minute from

747
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,480
Hudson that was coming out on the virtual console and these are also kind of exciting

748
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,600
you're gonna be getting double dungeons and

749
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,560
Splatterhouse in March Oh God splatter house do a fancy star for real. Yeah

750
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah, I saw a fantasy stars coming out too for a virtual console

751
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,280
That's awesome. Where'd you hear that?

752
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
from the internet

753
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Most reliable source ever

754
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:35,200
Yeah, so I know those two looks like they're gonna be both 600 points and according to Hudson's site both do out

755
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
on March

756
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,900
Sonic Spinball

757
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,240
Cuz he mentioned it is one of those games like complete opposite end for Mac Tracer. Okay?

758
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,000
It's one of those games that like you remember as being really cool like, you know

759
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,400
Oh, it's Sonic is a pinball game. And oh, I remember this game was just so awesome

760
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,620
And then you play it for five minutes and you go god this shit's boring

761
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,160
Isn't it is it just me?

762
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,280
No, it's kind of like you like when I go around you and then you start talking to me for about five minutes

763
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
I'm like, I want to go home

764
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,300
Except not really because I love you Rob hearts to you. Let's be the last episode orange launch radio. You ever hear

765
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:17,220
Mm-hmm. Bye speaking of people that shouldn't be talking more than five minutes at a time

766
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Perrin Kaplan

767
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,620
Opened her mouth about some new things going on the week, by the way

768
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:29,480
I believe Perrin Kaplan also said that the gamecube had been ceased production that there's no more game cubes

769
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,420
Right, and then it came out later in the week that oh just kidding. We really haven't stopped making the game cubes

770
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,460
I think Perrin Kaplan is kind of like I kind of treat her like

771
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:44,460
Opposite woman like when she says something the opposite is actually true. It's this clever marketing play

772
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,980
Yeah, anytime she talks it's like Oh introduction to the opposites

773
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,980
Gets that

774
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,900
This must be the introduction to the opposite sketch. I totally got it. Okay, but you get it too. Oh wow

775
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,540
Just like the other things that she said. Oh the weeds gonna be region-free

776
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:09,020
That was turned out to be true. It's not one of the other gems. Yeah, that was the other gem that she said

777
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,580
Some other things she talked about is that there could already be a Wii revision on the Wii

778
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
DVD playback enabled on it

779
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:23,780
Okay, okay. What do you mean? Oh my god? There's already a how many DVD players do you have in your house?

780
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,340
Three or four so do you need another one on the Wii? I don't think so

781
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:34,300
I don't cares. Yeah, I don't bring the pink we out already. I don't think anyone's not buying the Wii because

782
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,260
It doesn't have DVD playback. I know that's just a stupid feature anyways

783
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,800
I mean, it's kind of thrown in because you know their DVD ROM drives might as well

784
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:49,320
Just put the codex in there. Yeah, that was like popular like five years ago when nobody had a DVD and now it's like hey

785
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,820
Exactly so I mean the game cube didn't really play DVDs, so

786
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:02,140
Who gives a shit looking at our chat chat dot orange launch radio comm speedy f40 says the game cube will live on forever

787
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,780
Well, yeah, cuz the Wii will play all your GameCube games, so I mean I mean seriously

788
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,740
I when I heard that it was going away

789
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,180
I was like well that makes sense but the best part about the Wii playing the GameCube games

790
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,020
And I always have to explain this to my customers

791
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,140
They're running out GameCube games for the Wii and stuff if you don't have GameCube controllers

792
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,840
You're fucked you can't play your GameCube games without GameCube controllers

793
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,020
Which to be honest is the dumbest thing in the world anyways they should totally support the you know classic controller

794
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
I third-party controllers

795
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,420
Okay, or I'm just saying well. What about you know the classic controller

796
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:39,120
They should you know support that so you don't have to buy yet another fucking controller to plug in to play the GameCube games

797
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,700
Let's see act def says who the hell listens to parent Kaplan

798
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,540
Okay, look show me five gaming blogs that did not run the story this week

799
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:53,600
Okay, that run stories on Nintendo usually the thing is is that whatever she says makes it on every major gaming blog out there

800
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,780
So and for some reason we posted that as well

801
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,620
Joe she 16 says she is a classic contrary Mary

802
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,580
I've never heard that term Wow

803
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,620
contrary Mary contrary contrary Mary I guess

804
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,060
Very emphasis on the wrong syllable

805
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,500
I said it's a contra no contrary

806
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:23,100
Let's see what else is there uh let's see footy monster. No. I'm sorry who said it was a selling point

807
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,960
Damn it somebody in chat room. I'm sorry whoever said it. Oh footy. Oh footy monster did say it doesn't matter sky

808
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,480
It's a selling point talking about the DVD playback. Yeah, it's like well. I don't know who cares really well. I don't know what

809
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,820
Fix their online

810
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,700
That'd be great. Let's fix the online something that we're actually going to use instead of

811
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,660
Let's make DVD playback all in time. Yeah, okay

812
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,780
We've established that you're the only one that the messages don't download when it's off

813
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,140
No, it doesn't work for me either

814
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,200
It works for me because I'm the cooler than you because you have that USB you have a dongle

815
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,620
You use your dongle and the dongle makes it all work

816
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,420
It does quite look like a penis for the computer anyway moving right along anyway

817
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,500
So you know if you're looking forward to more independent games on the Wii and they have this big program that they were touting

818
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,900
Originally saying that they were going to fund you know a bunch of independent games

819
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:21,100
This whole independent development developer program in which they would give them free development kits and that kind of stuff

820
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,240
Well the only problem is they don't have enough development kits to go around apparently

821
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,220
They're also in short supply just like the actual Wiis are

822
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:34,260
So a lot of these independent developers aren't going to get to make their crappy ports of games that they probably already released

823
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:41,620
Well the sad part of that is though for those that were wondering where are the downloadable indie games on the virtual console?

824
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:48,080
They haven't even there. They're just a they're a twinkle in mommy's eye right now because there's no dev kits. That's it

825
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,420
What?

826
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,020
Never mind, but you know to be honest, so there's gonna be some there's just starting

827
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:01,180
You know to get those really crappy games out there. I mean was I was gonna say there's one game coming out in

828
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,500
April which I know everybody's gonna run out and pick up chicken shoot

829
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,260
On the Wii yes, it's a game where you shoot chickens

830
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,020
Do it if it's if it's like duck hunt with chickens sold oh my god chicken

831
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,780
She didn't instantly sell that title if they just change it to cock shoot. Hey wait a minute wait a minute

832
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,140
Who are you? Oh by the way? This is like you style highlight. You know I'm showing a long time

833
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
longtime listener

834
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:36,420
Now you've been on the show before but not not in its podcast form so nobody knows who you are in other words, okay?

835
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,500
Well, I'm just the nameless voice well really well wait really quickly your three favorite games of all time

836
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:47,020
and why really quickly so we know what type of gamer you are Final Fantasy 6 chrono trigger and

837
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,180
Chicken shoot

838
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
All right

839
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,500
Mm-hmm he's a big do cosplay

840
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,580
No, I'm kidding. You know he's a big fan of Actraiser

841
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,020
He played act you just missed the Actraisers come in a virtual console in Japan. I know I got a boat or two

842
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:16,620
Alright, you know so yeah that that's it. No no development kit for me the poor independent folks

843
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,980
You know

844
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,060
Poor them they can't get free development kids. Oh

845
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,420
You cute

846
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:28,100
GS 68 says crack shoot how about instead of chickens you if they bring out chicken shoot

847
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,980
I think there should be another mode in it like you remember how a duck hunt had the duck shoot

848
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,140
And then they had the sleigh shooting. Yeah, they should have chicken shoot and waffle shoot

849
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,380
Speedy f-40 wants to see cock block for the Wii

850
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:49,460
I mean interesting tie isn't that isn't that what was that PSP cock block for the Wii was that PSP game

851
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,060
We played at the Konami Brooktown isn't that kind of what?

852
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,660
Forget it no

853
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,140
That's just one of those games is like I'm so popular in the fictional high school

854
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,460
If only it were true in real life stick it in the game

855
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:09,540
Stick it in the game. No stick it in comma the game get it never mind like

856
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:15,660
Bunga that doesn't even make sense you wouldn't even put a comma there, so that's all I know Wario where smooth moves

857
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,620
Is there is there a minigame in where we're smooth moves that stick it in no you stick in the game

858
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,640
Remember that one where you push down the Super Nintendo game in there man all right moving on anyway um

859
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,540
Speaking of the Wii since we have a lot of Wii news tonight

860
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,960
This is also noteworthy because weezer still very hard to find yet

861
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,340
They have outsold the 360 and the PlayStation 3 in January

862
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,820
And this is some preliminary data that made its way onto the internet the Wii sold

863
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,420
436 hundred I'm sorry four hundred thirty six thousand units 360

864
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
294,000 units PlayStation 3

865
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:57,140
244,000 units so it is it's only 50,000 units separating 360 and PlayStation 3 then again 360 has been on the market for a year

866
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,820
So it doesn't look too good for Sony Sony might need some games to come out pretty soon

867
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:06,900
To rescue them, but who knows what's gonna happen motor storms coming out in fucking a couple weeks

868
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,900
And I cannot wait to play that average racing game

869
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,160
But it's still fun. It looks awesome. Well. I'm sure there's some is it on the show world tonight some of the play

870
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,300
I don't think we put Q Burt or flow or that stuff

871
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,700
So I guess we could take a moment to mention that Q Burt and flow made its way to the yeah

872
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,260
I heard Q Burt together. I heard Q Burt sucks and flow is short

873
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:31,420
I heard they redid Q Burt, and I heard it sucks really. I like Q Burt. I want to play it

874
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,420
Can I will you download it can I come over and play it? I?

875
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,860
Don't know if I want to waste that kind of money. Oh come on. I'll don't you bought a PlayStation

876
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,820
Oh, well you didn't buy the PlayStation you bought games for the PlayStation 3

877
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,580
You bought Ridge Racer 7 when you already had it when it was called Ridge Racer

878
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:51,380
I know it still sucks, and I bought full auto 2 and it's still full auto 1

879
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,660
They just put it in new packaging at a crappy deathmatch mode, and I was a sucker

880
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,500
And I bought that crap so you can say yeah

881
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,100
You're getting some compliments tonight

882
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,780
Seisha says Loki is great this evening and a footy monster says Loki is picking up the slack for dark soccer tonight

883
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,780
He's like double pissed off

884
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,660
It's just I mean I hate these games that they put out at launch and they call this sequel

885
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,940
And it's really not a sequel

886
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:21,180
It's just like fucking it's like a perfect example is for the Wii coming out next month Prince of Persia rival sword

887
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:28,460
It's fucking two thrones all over again. All you do is tack on some stupid controls to it and added chariot racing

888
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:36,220
Chariot race that was the only thing that was missing from the first one. Oh god. I really wish there was chariot racing in this

889
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,740
They got my letters yes

890
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,100
Ravens dolphin in the chat room says a flow is a beautiful screensaver. Yes

891
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:52,460
I hear it's a screen saver the reviews. I've heard like it's after dark at the game listen. Okay listen Sony

892
00:37:53,180 --> 00:38:00,660
Stop making games that utilize this stupid tilt functionality crap because to be honest. They're not that great

893
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,420
I mean flow okay. That's kind of cool. You know because it was a cool web game when it was free and stuff

894
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:14,220
But this like super rubber dub or whatever it's coming out with the Ducks. It's the same damn game again

895
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,220
It's just like that other

896
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:22,180
Game that was out there right now. That's kind of a clone of geometry wars that one sucks to

897
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,580
Stop releasing games. It's just a stupid gimmick

898
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,220
Jeremy Todd one in chat have some advice for Sony

899
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,420
This is sure to make the Sony fanboys very pleased Jeremy Todd one says I got an idea for what Sony should do I think

900
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,460
Sony should go ride the roller coaster at death right into the lake of fire doom and torture where its eyes will get ripped and

901
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:44,260
Then they're forced to eat the eyes with a broken fork where they will continually watch bad TV shows over and over

902
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:50,420
You can address those cards and letters to Jeremy Todd one care of orange lounge anyways so more happy stuff though

903
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,220
Elite beat agents is getting a sequel which isn't too surprising because the game is pretty awesome

904
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,060
So definitely actually it is surprising is the game didn't sell as well as they thought it would especially not in Japan

905
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:05,980
Yeah, but it's Nintendo. They're not gonna come up with anything original gaming come on. He's so are you smoking crack?

906
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,340
What is the we what is the we?

907
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,980
Oh, okay, I'm not gonna come up with something original, okay?

908
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:19,300
Let me see here um another Super Mario sequel another Metroid sequel another Donkey Kong sequel whoo. That's brand new shit

909
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,380
I think we got a wee leadest here

910
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:30,580
Anyways, so a leap e agents with yet more you know some different music because this is what this is the natural progression of your

911
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,460
You know music games is let's get some different music

912
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:41,020
Um they're not really specifying a release date yet, but they're seeing that the new game is gonna have four player action and

913
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,980
It's gonna have a new snappy title

914
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,220
All right

915
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,980
So I I cannot wait for this game, but they're saying that the Japanese version is getting a sequel

916
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
We don't know about American yet, right?

917
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,500
No word on the u.s.. Yeah, but you know if it's coming on Japan. They're gonna translate it so

918
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,860
Well, I mean they didn't really translate oh and on they kind of gave us a whole new version

919
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:09,020
That was I think better, but you know depends. What kind of music you're into anyway Eddie is dying over here

920
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,580
He wants to share some wee news that wasn't on our show roll

921
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,660
Yeah, there's there's an unconfirmed rumor on the internet

922
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:22,860
Which is always reliable that Nintendo is gonna come out with sensor ankle straps so like you can kick and dance and kick

923
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,780
That's that's a bunch of bullshit

924
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,220
I think that'd be odd like it even if it's not sure like if it was true. That'd be awesome. That'd be so cool

925
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Can anybody say Sega activator?

926
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,060
Sega activator that's pretty easy I

927
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,900
Think that'd be cool. I don't know like you could like run and jump and do it and do it

928
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,100
SSJ 100 man chat says that's fake

929
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,340
Oh shot down ouch

930
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Sweet

931
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,740
Dead air I

932
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:08,780
Just wanted to point out though a Loki the Nintendo fanboy train is going by and you know you're not on it oh

933
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:24,380
Oh sick burn Rob. Come on Loki get on the wee fanboy train. That's why we don't give him like a fucking soundboard because we'd have stuff like this.

934
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:30,740
No, yes, because no Loki actually is a Nintendo. He likes Nintendo. I went over to his video game party

935
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,700
It was like all Nintendo pretty much. I mean so he's not against Nintendo come on now

936
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,380
I'm picking up and you know SSX blur next week, and that's gonna be awesome. I'm really looking forward to that

937
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,980
But to be honest you know

938
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,500
There's a lot of games that are coming out

939
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,420
And mostly by Ubisoft so fuck you Ubisoft because I hate you

940
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,460
That are just fucking ports of shit. I mean

941
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:00,620
Stop releasing like old-ass games under a new title because they're on the portable systems now and on the Wii

942
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,980
You know it's just a port of some old game that was out before listen

943
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,260
It didn't sell well the first time stop trying to port it over to get some more sales out of it

944
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,780
Especially do we do we really need another port of driver parallel lines?

945
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:19,900
I mean wasn't it bad enough the first time and now you have to enhance it with some better control

946
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,260
What about the dude that was with what IGN or something that got quoted in some blogs as we saying guys?

947
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:31,580
Oh my god something really cool. He needs a diet of fire. Okay. That's stupid Matt Casamani or whatever

948
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,860
I've got secret news. I can't tell you about it, but it's so over cool

949
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,620
You're just gonna be so amazed when you hear about it, okay?

950
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:44,460
Well that could be anything that could be anything and the fact that you come out and say I got a secret

951
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,980
I'm not telling you though. I got a secret. You're gonna. Love it. It's so cool

952
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:55,500
Mm-hmm uh-huh why the fuck okay? Why the fuck is he posting that in his blog in the earth?

953
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,820
You know the other thing is why the fuck are people posting it in their blogs like say dude

954
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,660
Did you hear the guy from IGN he heard that there's news coming? That's cool

955
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,180
And did you fuck is that oh my god?

956
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,980
You guys Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is coming to partner net but you didn't hear it from me

957
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,100
That's that missed our show world to you know

958
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:21,300
I'll think yeah that even though we're not supposed to talk about it. Do Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is totally a partner net Rob

959
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,700
What is this like the same guy that was the t-shirt dude from two weeks ago?

960
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,940
I like your t-shirt thing maybe wow that's pretty crazy because you do the voice exactly the same

961
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:36,820
That's my that's my uniform straight male voice actually oh wow you do really well. Thank you. You're welcome. You know rice princess

962
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,980
I'm just give me a beer and maybe a pie bitch. You know I'm gonna say you know other stuff a lot of stuff

963
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,180
That's on partner net that people go and report about it's not really

964
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:52,220
Surprises, it's like stuff. That's been in development stuff that a lot of people already knew about so and the fact

965
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,260
I don't I don't know if you guys read the fine print on your NDA's

966
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:03,500
But uh you're not supposed to talk about partner net and I hope that God that whoever keeps leaking this shit because it's not

967
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:11,040
Really, even a story. It's just like guess what I saw that that jetpack game that they've already announced is on partner net

968
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:18,360
Wow, you didn't announce the game. You didn't give me any details about the game all you said that is you're confirming something that they've already announced

969
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:26,720
Wow, that's awesome. Guess what Wario aware smooth moves. It's in stores now. I just confirm something that they've already announced

970
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,240
Give me my own blog

971
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,240
Joshi 16 says attention Loki. It's all about attention

972
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,920
Let's see what else is there here and Nintendo maniac 64 says breaking news

973
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
There's news coming

974
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,760
GS68 says Loki a free speech anyone

975
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,240
Fine, but I don't have to listen to them

976
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
All right. Well anyhow

977
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,680
We should move on to another story here

978
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,600
And this is like this ongoing saga like I thought we would have talked about this once on the show

979
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,160
laughed and it would be done with and I'm talking about

980
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,040
Level 30 and you know when I say level 30, I'm talking about

981
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,800
Yes

982
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,120
It's like do you want to know how far down the rabbit hole goes? Well, it's actually level 30 and that's about it

983
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,140
Well, here's the thoughts there. What's very interesting?

984
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:23,280
Is that not only when you get your replacement bubble bobble revolution that will let you go all the way to level 31

985
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,480
You get a free copy of Rainbow Islands

986
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,760
Revolution because I didn't even know there was a Rainbow Islands revolution

987
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,600
I did and I actually played the old-school Rainbow Islands. I still play it today on game tap

988
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,640
And I could care less that there's this DF version out and if I'm a Rainbow Islands fanboy

989
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,960
And don't give a shit about this DS release. I can't imagine there's five people who bought this game

990
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,400
Therefore you're getting this free game because nobody else wanted it. They have extra copies sitting in a warehouse

991
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,720
So does this atone for their sins is all well with Codemasters now because they gave you a free game

992
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,360
I mean you gotta say they didn't have to do that. Let me just put it this way they should really fire

993
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,720
They're marketing people because that cover for bubble bobble

994
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,880
Revolution or whatever looks like crap. I mean those dinosaurs look

995
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,360
They gain like a thousand pounds or something like Jenny Craig anyone

996
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,720
There's a nice little letter that came with it

997
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,660
Please find and closed a replacement for your defective bubble bobble Nintendo DS cartridge

998
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,720
You should find that you encounter no problems when playing this new version

999
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:31,400
We would like to apologize for the problems you've had with this game and hope that the need to swap the cartridges did not

1000
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,880
Inconvenience you too much. We have enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island

1001
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,640
Also for the Nintendo TS, so there's only one so oh great. Oh great

1002
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,360
So I got you know I my bubble bobble wouldn't go to level 30, and now there's only one goddamn island in Rainbow Islands

1003
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:55,160
Hahaha, okay wait. You know we've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island. You know why they included Rainbow Islands, right?

1004
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,400
Because bubble bubble really only goes up to 31

1005
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,560
So they're like oh you're gonna be done after 31

1006
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,680
Yeah, because I work for them anyway

1007
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,960
I know this we've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island as

1008
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,960
Consideration for the length of time that you had to wait for the new cartridges to be manufactured

1009
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,680
Please dispose of your faulty cartridge by simply putting it in the trash or local

1010
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,000
Recycling facility where one exists you know why it's called Rainbow Island

1011
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,760
Because they didn't finish the rest of the levels and you're gonna have to send it in

1012
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,020
No, you know what you need to fucking do with that replacement cartridge

1013
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,680
Return it to your local GameStop

1014
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,440
And get some money back because they're not gonna know the difference they got it come on

1015
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,760
They're not dumb enough to buy it. Yeah, they are way. They can tell no they're not

1016
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,820
Okay, fine. Take it back to your local whatever used game store all right well

1017
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,680
Uh stories about bubble bubble revolution going on four weeks in a row make me very angsty

1018
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,640
And I don't know about you, but that makes me want to bring on the pain with the FUs of the week

1019
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:16,560
A dark soccer is not here tonight. I will put in a preemptive dark soccer FU to traffic and people with how she's busy with massage school and all that crap all right Loki what's your FU tonight?

1020
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,640
I don't really have an FU, but I'm gonna take this moment to

1021
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,920
Let everyone in on a huge secret

1022
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,040
There is some uber huge exciting news

Coming soon, and I tell you once you hear what this news is it's gonna fucking blow your mind

1024
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,060
It's so amazing. I really wish I could tell you, but I can't

1025
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
You know NDA's and all

1026
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,980
I like how they follow the NDA's when it comes to that news, but when it comes to everything else it is kind of wet NDA

1027
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,940
You know why cuz there's no news

1028
00:48:54,300 --> 00:49:00,060
This is the same guy said there's fucking halo on the Gameboy Advance. I mean come on. Oh my god. There is oh

1029
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,240

Unsubscribe all right uh I

Would like to give an FU to whoppers the original malted milk balls because they are so addicting and I think bro

1032
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,780
I remain in a bunch of them when I wasn't here so FU to that don't steal my whoppers when I'm not here

1033
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,260
Give me my malted milk balls

1034
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,700
How dare it bitch?

1035
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,500
How dare you take my malted milk balls Eddie?

1036
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,580
I'd like to say an FU to all the garbage that I've been keeping in my closet because I'm moving and I have to throw

1037
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:38,840

1038
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,740
FU garbage in my closet

1039
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:46,460
What else do you have in your closet nothing rice princess

1040
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,060
FU to the auction house on Elder Thallus because

1041
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:59,180
You're stupid, and you'd never have good leather head here that I need for my Twink

1042
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,380
Yeah, let's do few more poo-poo

1043
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,380
Yeah, what the hell does that even mean?

1044
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,700
Let's do more poo-poo. What does that even mean?

1045
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,860
It's supposed to be like get off the game and go shut up for a second. I'm kidding

1046
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,280
It's supposed to be less pew pew more pew pew

1047
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:20,000
But I call it less pew pew more poo poo because it's funner to say

1048
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,940
What does even pew pew mean like shooting like pew pew?

1049
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,620
But what if you're a warrior you don't really shoot then punch yourself in the face. Why the fuck are you playing a warrior?

1050
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,340
Warriors in lane

1051
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,700
Playing a rogue or a hunter anything else

1052
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:41,460
And that's it like you style. Do you have anything you wish to I contribute a few the Taco Bell because it makes more poo-poo

1053
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,620
Yeah, more poo-poo less pew pew

1054
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,140
in that case

1055
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,980
You know you

1056
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,300
Speaking of

1057
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:01,040
Things that are pretty poo-poo in my opinion alien Hamed is coming to Xbox 360. Sorry. I did not like alien Hamed

1058
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,020
I are hominid or whatever the hell it is. What's alien Hamed alien Hamed? It was a game

1059
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:10,460
That was out on the PlayStation 2 no. I know what alien hominid is it's a flash game. It's not that great

1060
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,900
I don't know why people are like so freakin excited and ecstatic

1061
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,740
I mean I suppose yay indie development and all that stuff, but I'm not gonna buy it

1062
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:23,980
But whatever alien hominid HD is confirmed to be the game coming to Xbox Live Arcade this Wednesday

1063
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:30,380
Because Xbox live talked to one up and somebody spilled the guts because everybody always talks to one up because I don't know I think

1064
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:35,020
They pay people to talk probably yeah, so they get that

1065
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:41,700
So there you go and also hopefully boom boom rocket and wing commander are in the near future

1066
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,300
Oh boy. I'm sure we have a story on that later. Don't we Loki?

1067
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:54,860
Yes, wing commanders coming to Xbox live arcade wing commander arena and nobody cares because it looks like shit

1068
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,860
I don't know if anyone's seen the videos out there

1069
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,780
But the wing commander that you've known and loved or maybe didn't like

1070
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,980
This is certainly not the same game in fact. This is as much wing commander as

1071
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,900
Nova drone was Twisted Metal, so I

1072
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:18,820
Don't know, but anyways if you're interested. It's 16 players online and you can battle each other might be cool

1073
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,300
No, well come on

1074
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:26,380
I mean even though the game did not look like wing commander like if you've seen the little game preview somebody took the wing commander

1075
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:32,500
License and put it on some like random space shooter game, but 16 people come on. That's got to be fun

1076
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:38,280
What's novadrome fun with 16 people novadrome? No, you're right novadrome was just like a fun game at all anyway

1077
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,180
So it is coming out. It's going to have you know up to 16 players

1078
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,180
They're going to have free-for-all maps dueling maps team maps

1079
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,660
blah blah blah

1080
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,340
and

1081
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,140
Yeah, it's great

1082
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,140
There's videos online YouTube

1083
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,860
I'm game trailers comms check it out and be disappointed

1084
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:04,340
Apparently boom boom rocket is really anticipated by a lot of folks in chat room that looks fun. It doesn't fun

1085
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:09,420
I love see I like DDR, and I did like fan of vision so our old buddy

1086
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,140
Mel B's in chat and says it's like dance mania speed meets fireworks. That's a boom boom rocket is

1087
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,980
Well, that's all I want to say I want to see a

1088
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,060
Video of that emotion we see screenshots, but screenshots only tell you so much

1089
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:27,180
You know that would be kind of fun to play Def Jam icon of dance mania speed as the custom soundtrack in that

1090
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,380
Any game with a dance mania speed is the custom soundtrack is sure to be hilarity

1091
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:39,460
Something that's not funny is my Xbox 360 it makes too damn much noise whenever I'm playing it and

1092
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,900
apparently though there is a rumor going around because you know when when

1093
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:47,700
Websites that are foreign release news. It's just the case this German website

1094
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:52,900
It's only a rumor the the u.s.. Websites won't believe it until Microsoft

1095
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:58,740
I can't read it well, whatever, but anyway um it certainly sounds like it could be a possibility a German gaming website

1096
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:03,100
When it was it called things in a might not dear Sinemite

1097
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,380
I don't know they they announced that

1098
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:12,740
Microsoft has done a software update for debug Xbox 360s that reduces the speed of the DVD drive

1099
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:19,820
Causing the noise to go down, but the drive is slower than yeah, but did it need all the high speeds

1100
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,320
I mean, I would ask well

1101
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:26,400
Don't you think the update is smart enough to know hey when you need the high speed use high speed when you don't need it

1102
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,940
Shut up. They don't really care. How loud the DVD drive is cuz me be honest

1103
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,120
I don't really notice mine when I'm playing games, and if you're gonna be wrong sitting there going damn

1104
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,500
My drive is loud, then you're gonna die. I'm gonna be honest

1105
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,460
I do notice it especially when you boot the system like when you boot and you're starting a game

1106
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:47,940
That's when I really noticed that I'm like goddamn is my Xbox 360 gonna launch into space cuz it makes so much noise

1107
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,820
It's gonna just blast off through the roof

1108
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,540
Don't you think they make up? Maybe it's just cuz mines vertical standing

1109
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:59,900
I don't know I think because yours on is on a hard surface and so it transfers the sound

1110
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:04,100
But I mean if you put it on carpet like I have mine right now

1111
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:08,260
I was playing on my monitor on my computer and so I have it sitting on next to my

1112
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:12,100
You know normal PC, and I don't really hear it. I mean I

1113
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,780
Don't know, but then again. I have headphones on and I'm listening to the music and stuff so

1114
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,100
but

1115
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,300
Whatever. I don't know. It's not a big deal for me. I mean if it was like

1116
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:26,340
Like the whole time when you're playing it then that'd be a little different, but

1117
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,580
It would just be really weird if it was that. Unsubscribe clicks you were getting.

1118
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:36,620
Throughout the world. So it's not a huge deal though. It's not like like a chainsaw sound or something like that

1119
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:40,220
I don't know it people just need to quit bitching

1120
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:46,580
Speedy F40 ouch ears GS 68 Loki WTF alpha canagram damn Loki

1121
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,500
It's better etc. Loki needs a sedative

1122
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:55,900
I was gonna say Eddie was making fun of me calling my wireless headset a wireless communicator at one point

1123
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,740
But I wanted to say during my gaming week. I bought one of those $20 things you can put in your computer

1124
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,420
What's about the gaming receiver or something like that so you can use your wireless headset?

1125
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:10,860
It's awesome because I can use my wireless headset on ventrilo and it what I didn't have to do any configuration my computer

1126
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:16,180
Ventrilo just automatically new and like the voices come through on the ear and you can talk with the heads

1127
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,940
It's great. It's just buy a bunch of this and I'll do the show

1128
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,200
It's too bad Rob cuz the ventrilo server doesn't work anymore

1129
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:30,420
So you've never gone and Rob puts on a red mini Ohura skirt and goes all hailing frequencies open captain for lovin

1130
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:36,020
You know even understands that nobody from Star Trek thousands of listeners of orange

1131
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:41,300
I'm sorry hundreds of listeners after tonight of action. Actually, maybe 20 listeners more time after tonight and

1132
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,260
Not a one of them is gonna understand that

1133
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,580
All right

1134
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:54,780
Anywho, well one thing that's never quieting down is these stupid rumors about mill yourself for on the 360 and

1135
00:56:54,780 --> 00:57:01,420
And yet another one kind of flaming or fanning the flames of this rumor. There's apparently a

1136
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:09,100
kind of a survey going around asking people of their interests and mill yourself for on the Xbox 360 and

1137
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,380
Questions like would you like to see mill yourself for on the Xbox 360?

1138
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,500
Would you buy an Xbox 360 just to play mill yourself for?

1139
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:24,220
On a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 being not at all satisfied and 100 being very satisfied

1140
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:28,540
How would you rate Konami's output on Xbox 360 to date?

1141
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:35,180
Well, that would be a big fat crap because and also on this survey. Do you like candy?

1142
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:42,780
Do you like money because it's Captain Obvious's survey, of course people want to see Metal Gear Solid on 360, right?

1143
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,320
I mean more games the better like you saw you're shaking your head. Why not?

1144
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,500
Because I hate the Xbox 360

1145
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,020
Basically, thank you. Why do you hate the 360? I don't hate it

1146
00:57:54,020 --> 00:58:00,620
I don't hate it, but it's not as good as is like a DS or we sign reasons titles

1147
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,100
That's what matters. Yeah

1148
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:08,220
360 he's got a lot of shit coming out. I mean, I don't know a lot of it's good, you know

1149
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,620
exclusive titles boom boom rocket

1150
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,220
Well, I'm like boom boom fire booboo dollar

1151
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:21,420
No, I'm gonna get one only for the mist Walker titles cuz I'm a big og Final Fantasy fanboy dragon

1152
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,500
Yes, blue fucking dragon dragon looks awesome. And so does lost Odyssey. So

1153
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:33,940
Lost Odyssey's a ways off. It's not hopefully it won't be a lost cause

1154
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:40,860
No, but anyways this comes from apparently an evil avatar forum post so

1155
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:46,740
I take that as rumor, I guess to be honest. I don't believe that this such survey exists, but you know

1156
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:52,100
Evil avatars another all-game show so we got a I'm just saying but this is like a listener

1157
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,060
This isn't exactly you know, but whatever I mean

1158
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:02,460
It's possible that they're do they really need to ask people what their interest is in mill yourself for I mean, that's like

1159
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,380
Yeah, I'm like, would you like to see halo 3? I

1160
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,060
mean

1161
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,900
It's dumb

1162
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,100
Shadows lair says my god a survey amazing. It's confirmed. I

1163
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,460
Think it was a little bit of sarcasm sarcasm there speaking of obvious

1164
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:24,580
It sounds like crackdown 2 is already being greenlit and that gets a big fat duh as well

1165
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,260
I

1166
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:31,620
Mean, maybe maybe it'll contain the halo 4 beta in the that was the joke that yeah, I read that

1167
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:34,820
Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah, I stole a joke from whatever the site of QJ or whatever

1168
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,620
But I mean come on didn't take a lot of brains come up with that joke

1169
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,740
Cuz isn't that the only reason why crackdowns really selling a halo 3 beta?

1170
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:44,220
I think a lot of people are actually buying for the game because it's a fun game

1171
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,500
It's a lot of fun

1172
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,320
And I mean if it were just for the halo 3 beta then you wouldn't see a lot of people

1173
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:56,200
you know playing the game right now because a halo 3 beta isn't out this by the way comes from a

1174
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:03,880
Interviewer with senior designer Steven in Netta when he gave a review to computer video games simply this magazine

1175
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:11,120
He mentioned you know was what he would put in a crackdown to which you know obviously a more believable

1176
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,240
Functioning city the city makes the fun

1177
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,660
I think it comes to how you can choose how you choose and approach your missions and so on and so on well the thing

1178
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:24,020
Is about crackdown and the even and we're talking about when they were designing the game originally

1179
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:30,560
They've made it to where they can add islands and add whole extra parts of the city that aren't in the full game right now

1180
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:37,040
Later on so this game can expand almost as much as like oblivion can so

1181
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,680
You know I hope they go that route

1182
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:46,320
That'd be really cool chat room is shooting down the whole halo Chi stand corrected apparently a ddr dollar bill says I like to crack

1183
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:51,880
down fuck halo 3 beta Jeremy Todd once is I could care less about the halo 3 beta crackdown as amazing as a game and

1184
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:57,520
Ddr dollar bill confirms again crackdown is more fun than fucking halo. I mean don't get me wrong

1185
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:03,240
I'm gonna play the halo 3 beta because I'm gonna you know be able to play the halo 3 beta, but I

1186
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:09,120
Don't know. I'm not too excited about it. I think it's just gonna be everyone's gonna be I think disappointed because

1187
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,360
There's been a lot of people who have done it really good so far

1188
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:19,960
And there's not really much you can innovate on and this you know big secret X button crap or whatever that is

1189
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,180
I don't think it's gonna be that big deal, so whatever we shall see anyways

1190
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:31,780
So another thing that's gonna be shown pretty soon is gonna be Xbox 360s IP TV

1191
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:36,860
service, and they're actually showing it at the connected home show at

1192
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,320
Well in Europe of course some brand new

1193
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,180
show down there and

1194
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,420
Looks interesting not really too much

1195
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:51,640
You know they don't really go into any details on it, but I guess it's gonna have you know DVR stuff in there as well

1196
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:57,680
Anything that gave me more TV channels. I'm all for so you know I can't wait to check this out

1197
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,880
Hopefully you know they start you know having some

1198
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:07,540
You know I want a DVR anyways because I don't have that currently with my cable subscriber, but

1199
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,080
Hopefully, it's not all like MSNBC or something like that

1200
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,200
I'm curious about it. I don't like the fact that you have to switch everything to do it

1201
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,520
I'm not gonna switch everything just to have TV on my 360. Yeah, I mean apparently it's gonna be taking place

1202
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,600
So um the connected home show and that's March 5th through 7th in Olympia, London

1203
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,080
I'd like to see some youtubage of it in motion I

1204
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:39,360
Don't know anyhow something else very cool announced to the Xbox 360 price cuts for the games yay

1205
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,040
Actually not all the games

1206
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,480
It's the platinum hit series

1207
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,560
But you know we all like news on a price cut and actually a lot of those are already price cut so I've already been

1208
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:53,340
Price cut yeah, they just saw the new packaging well supposedly March 16th is the day that the new packaging will come out

1209
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,340
But it sounds like a lot of retailers have been proactive

1210
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,200
Whatever you drop the price well for the low low price of 30 bucks

1211
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:05,120
You can get battlefield to burn out revenge Call of Duty 2 dead or alive 4 fight night round 3

1212
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:10,620
Ghost Recon advanced warfighter topspin 2 or Rockstar Games table tennis

1213
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:15,160
Which I seem to recall only cost 39 in the first place yeah, so it's not much of a price cut

1214
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,860
But um and topspin 2 sucks balls don't buy it

1215
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:24,040
But some of those other ones that a lot of very popular such as Ghost Recon is pretty popular Call of Duty 2 about

1216
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:30,160
Battlefield and so on I'm pretty sure folks will be all over that all you need to know that just means that those used games

1217
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:35,580
Are going to drop down even more so just buy the used games especially if they're that old. There's no point

1218
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:40,800
Japan's getting some extra games in there well actually they only get battlefield

1219
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:48,280
But burnout but chrome hounds as well and perfect dark zero and other regions in Asia also get 99 nights

1220
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,680
Which should be interesting chrome hounds?

1221
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:55,640
I do believe is already dropped down in price in the United States as well, so I mean

1222
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,520
You can probably find that if you really keep in mind if you want to have the best tanks in the game or whatever the

1223
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,400
Best mechs whatever you call them you have to buy extra stuff online

1224
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,480
Just wait for armored core 4 because this is the game that you should have bought in the first place anyways

1225
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,000
And you know I was a sucker also bought chrome hounds thinking. Oh, it's gonna be just like armored core

1226
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,960
It's like armored core with like anchors being dragged behind you. It's so

1227
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,200
slow and

1228
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,320
Boring armor core for it's the way to go um anyways

1229
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,240
There's another rumor that's been confirmed this week

1230
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,960
Mercenaries 2 is coming to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360

1231
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,880
Despite the fact that this is kind of news that everybody already knew about since you know

1232
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:43,960
There was like you know some shots that they were talking about the game and stuff, and there was 360 dev kids behind them

1233
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,320
I mean

1234
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:49,600
It's like a big duh so that game is gonna be coming out mercenaries if you don't remember

1235
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,960
Originally believe was put out by Lucasarts, and it was one of those games that you can I remember the commercial actually for it

1236
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,520
They're all you know you know shoot people blow stuff up blow stuff up again

1237
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:06,120
You know it's it's kind of one of those sandbox type of games where you can just cause a lot of mayhem

1238
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:10,280
Cause a lot of mayhem, so I will definitely be checking it out

1239
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:19,040
And except for fall by the way a game that I will definitely check out is Elder Scrolls 5 because you know

1240
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,040
there's gonna be one on the way and

1241
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,800
Elder Scrolls 4 was obviously an amazing game on

1242
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:29,960
Bethesda has confirmed Elder Scroll 5 will happen. It's definitely going to happen

1243
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,480
There's no immediate plans right now according to the studio's vice president of PR marketing Pete Hines

1244
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:41,520
but what else is interesting is that he says the possibility of an MMO is kind of a

1245
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,480
natural step for the series

1246
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,240
very interesting

1247
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,760
But what's interesting about that?

1248
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:55,800
It's been bounced around according to Heinz, but they will not move forward with it unless there's a fresh idea for the MMO genre

1249
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:00,760
But dude, I think opening up oblivion as an MMO would you know or that type of game is an MMO

1250
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,400
It's good enough

1251
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:06,240
Don't you think I mean God on that multiplayer patch hit most people were like this should have just been in the game to begin

1252
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,920
With it's gonna be crazy though. It'd be interesting. I

1253
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:15,760
Don't know. I can't wait. I but you know you're not gonna see this game until like

1254
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:21,120
2009 at their earliest I mean it's going to be at the it's gonna be when people are talking about

1255
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:27,920
PlayStation 4 and Xbox 720 whenever that you know happens or the fuck else they're gonna call it. Yeah, we'll see

1256
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,040
anyways

1257
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:36,600
So with clover being dissolved some of the members of course went on to create the brand new company seed

1258
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:42,280
The other members stick are stuck around and are now working for Capcom. Well. What are they working on?

1259
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,440
you can be seeing them working on Resident Evil 5 for one and

1260
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,440
Of course a brand new Wii game as well

1261
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,920
So it's kind of nice to see you know clover because I know they were

1262
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:59,760
Doing a lot of original IPs and stuff and kind of you know throwing that kind of creative side to Resident Evil

1263
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,320
5 and

1264
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,120
Hopefully this Wii game. That's pretty awesome, so

1265
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,600
Pretty sweet, huh?

1266
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,520
Interesting I so I guess clover not as far gone as you know some people think well

1267
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,680
They're gone, but it's just they've kind of you know

1268
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,240
It's it's like you know if you buy a company or something like that a lot of times

1269
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:24,400
You'll dissolve the company and just say okay, whoever wants to move over. We'll pay you to move over otherwise

1270
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,280
Find a new job. You know it's kind of like that all right pretty much keep the same people, but

1271
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,680
Yeah, you know the talent, but you don't have to carry

1272
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:38,240
You don't have to pay for the you know the spot you know the lease or whatever you're just cutting costs that way so well

1273
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,380
That was the last story we had paid for part a but we're actually running a little early tonight

1274
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:45,160
So um I think we'll actually go to the skype line and take some calls

1275
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,280
I covertly open up the skype line there and saw if we get any calls

1276
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,600
So we'll get some calls out of the way early a little bit tonight because we're running early tonight

1277
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:57,640
So hi you uh you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? How you doing sky? I'm speedy f40 hi speedy f40

01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,640
I'm not a new listener

1280
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,460
Because I've been listening to the podcast forever

Congratulations. Yeah, was it hot was this was it as good for you as it was for me

1285
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,540
I I'm sure it was probably better for you because I tried harder

1286
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:33,640
But I mean I'm sure it worked out for everybody all right speedy. What kind of games you into well right now. I'm playing

1287
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,620
Rebels Alliance, I don't know Star Wars deadly Alliance or something for the PSP because I got it through gamefly

1288
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:43,400
And it's mildly entertaining, but uh I plan some wow

1289
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:51,280
And some Wii games even though I got a topic for you. All right. What's up? I think the Wii is overrated oh

1290
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:58,240
Gasp you're on Loki's side tonight you so you are not on the train tonight with everybody else

1291
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,120
You're you're not on the Wii fanboy train. Yeah

1292
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,840
God

1293
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:11,400
Just kidding. Yeah, I'm not on the fanboy train. I think that the Wii is completely overrated because

1294
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:16,300
Okay, I think it's just about a more of a party system a fad system if you will I have a Wii

1295
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:22,700
I bought it the day it came out, and I'm missing I'm missing my gaming experience. I've been going to the PC more and more often

1296
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:29,820
But you know what's interesting do you think the Wii is going the way of the GameCube because I even I love Nintendo

1297
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:34,020
I would have paid the GameCube very similarly although you had some phenomenal games on GameCube

1298
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:40,180
You know Resident Evil 4 it was mostly a party system your Mario parties your Smash Brothers melees. You know it's a party system

1299
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:45,340
I don't think it'll go the way of the GameCube because it has that quirkiness, and it has games like oh gosh

1300
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:50,960
Wari aware which is a really fun game definitely kudos to them from doing that one

1301
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:55,980
But I think that a serious gamer would be better off with the Xbox 360

1302
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:59,220
So you don't think you know the uber-cool

1303
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:04,620
Metroid or or no no the uber-cool super secret thing the IGN guy won't shut up about you

1304
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,380
Don't think that's gonna change your mind

1305
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:10,460
No, I don't think a DVD drive or anything like that's gonna change my mind at all

1306
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,980
See I totally disagree because on the Twilight Princess

1307
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,980
I think that was a perfect marriage of

1308
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:20,900
Classic sort of old-school styling with combining some of the Wii elements to make it more immersive

1309
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,860
Oh, give me a break Twilight Princess sucked

1310
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:29,260
It was not as good as it could have been that was developed for the GameCube, and it showed definitely show

1311
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:34,840
Yeah, but I think it's just I think it showed that the that the it can do a classic style game and still be awesome

1312
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,160
It could do a classic style game when it's a freaking port

1313
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:42,420
I think that the Twilight Princess was entertaining because it was Zelda

1314
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:48,600
But I don't think it was any better than any other platformer could have been there was no huge breakthrough

1315
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:56,800
You know our chat room very polarized on the same topic JB Mon says Twilight Princess was overrated shadow next gen says I love Twilight Princess

1316
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:03,760
JB Mon also says Twilight Princess showed fanboys will love anything. You know what I like Wind Waker a lot better

1317
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,920
I'd be honest what you're smoking crack. I liked Wind Waker. I thought we'd make a Nintendo

1318
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,640
I am on the Nintendo train, and I didn't even like Wind Waker. I liked Wind Waker

1319
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,680
I thought it was a fun game the only good

1320
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:21,200
I was disappointed about Wind Waker is once you know and this is a spoiler once you go under the you know the ocean you

1321
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,080
See oh, it's Hyrule. You know I was like well

1322
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,200
Why the fuck did they just not make it like a remake of you know?

1323
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:31,160
You know link to the past or something like that with that kind of style

1324
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:35,120
I mean from the person who was criticizing Nintendo early in the show for doing too damn many remakes ah

1325
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,040
Okay, honed no. Here's what I'm saying though

1326
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,180
I don't necessarily want to do an actual remake

1327
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:45,600
But I just wanted to actually be in Hyrule instead of in the ocean

1328
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,660
I mean because I would have rather had you know more land and stuff like that and run around like that

1329
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:52,800
I don't mind the art, so I thought it was kind of different

1330
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:58,160
You know you got used to it, and it kind of worked. It's just and then now I'm playing you know

1331
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,480
Twilight Princess, and I lost interest in like an hour, so

1332
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,400
Same here loki same here. I don't get it. I don't get why everyone is a 10

1333
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,900
Did you play through the whole game though Twilight Princess? Yeah? No? I look like yeah?

1334
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,120
No, I'm sucks that you're gonna play through it. No yeah, no the first

1335
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,280
I mean the story doesn't really start developing right away, though

1336
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,240
I mean once you get into it. I mean it's like it's the first it to me

1337
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:27,320
It's the only true sequel to ocarina of time. I mean once you get into it like it's it's really cool

1338
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:31,840
They start touching base with all the old ocarina of time. I didn't even care about ocarina of time though. See that's it

1339
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,720
Oh, wow, so you're not even a Zelda fan then all right well the beautiful part of orange lounge radio

1340
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,280
Is that everybody is entitled to their own opinion even when they're wrong?

1341

Well, do you mind if I do some shameless plug-in? Oh?

1343
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,120

1344
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,720

1362
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,360
There's a lot of games just like yeah, who gives a shit, you know Nintendo got a mash

1363
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,960
Yeah, no, but you know, it's a third party

1364
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,740
I'll agree the third party games on the Wii do kind of sucks by the time. It'll be good. Yeah

I should give that a plug search for ol army. We have another call higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1375
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:25,000
Hi, this is Alex kid from a former Sega fame. How you doing? Hi Alex kid

1376
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:32,120
Wow, I'm really sorry to hear about your career. Whatever happened to you. Oh, well, I retired in 1990 and rather I didn't retire

1377
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:39,160
I got fired by Sega. They wanted to bring in that stupid fucking rodent sonic. Uh-huh. Think you're all familiar with him. Yeah, are you better?

1378
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:45,760
At all about that. No, cuz see here's what I think. I think he's only had one good game in the past five years

1379
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,160
I think

1380
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:52,040
It's high time that Sega brings me back. Do you think so bring it back all the classic stuff with Nintendo?

1381
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,240
Why don't they bring me back? Have you written Sega?

1382
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:58,160
Have you talked to your people to talk to Sega's people about I think a class to come back

1383
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:04,280
I I've been writing them for years and I you know, I had a restraining order like six years ago

1384
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:09,080
But that's that's expired now. I should talk to you know be world after them. I mean what they'll happen. I

1385
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,640
don't know like

1386
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,440
Shinobi world was like the last thing I ever did and

1387
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:22,080
Then they just threw this hedgehog at me and I couldn't well damn it. I mean, I mean Alex kid you

1388
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:28,000
Alex kid you sure you certainly don't know how to play this really bad at this game Alex kid

1389
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,920
Um, you didn't have blast processing

1390
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:38,240
No, but I mean look look I could go on the 360 and sell 10 more 10 times more copies

1391
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,680
Which would be 10 copies of the Sonic the Hedgehog game?

1392
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:47,520
All right, well 360 Alex kid is there a way we would see you on a virtual console at some point I

1393
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:54,240
I I don't know. Oh, I'd like to I I'd started writing in Nintendo and I started telling them, you know

1394
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:00,720
Bring back those master system games because nobody played them because your system kicked up kicked our systems ass. What happened there?

1395
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:06,000
Why didn't you go to Nintendo if that's where you're feeling the love Alex? Why didn't you go over to Nintendo?

1396
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,280
Do you know at the time it was a?

1397
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,480
Hiroshi Yamauchi and he gave me the finger and

1398
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:18,120
And you know, I don't know don't you mean he gave you rock and you had scissors?

1399
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,040
Hahaha

1400
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,760
Shut up. I

1401
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:29,280
Mean seriously Alex. That was the worst part of your fucking game who thought of putting rock-paper-scissors in a video game

1402
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,960
I hey, I'm gonna spend money on a video game so I can play rock-paper-scissors

1403
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:40,400
Did you ever play tech mobile? It's the same fucking thing. It's fucking rock-paper-scissors kid. You got a dirty mouth

1404
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,240
I'm gonna walk. Yeah, I know so, you know what this I'm giving it back to my buddy DMN. Hold on

1405
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,720

Sorry about that guys. Oh wow you

1408
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:10,980
He Alex kid came over wanted a call. It was frightening. Oh, so I can hang up on you then

1414
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:41,360
STFU is great, obviously, you know, what what be sure to make fun of you like ten times the amount of my soccer con show

1419
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:00,660
Huh? No kicking funny Dale because you disagree with him

1420
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,840
Okay

1421
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,560
The Rob D says I believe Derek H said he's too straight to listen to olr

1422
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
Whatever

1423
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,680
If you don't know what we're talking about or is the reference to one of our sister programs all games interactive

1424
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:21,100
Brother sister inbred cousin whatever you want to say. I'm too straight to listen though

1425
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,840
DMN any quick thoughts we're gonna take one more call before we take a break here. Um

1426
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,480
You should play luminous live because it's pretty fun. It's $20. I

1427
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:35,480
Know but I have luminous or not luminous live. Sorry luminous plus I have luminous on xbox 360

1428
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,480
I don't need it luminous plus $20. All right, that's your $20 you ever spend you're wrong, but have a nice day

1429
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:45,200
Anyway, you're wrong. Shut up. All right. Ah, I love hanging up on him one more call

1430
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:52,920
We'll go over here. Hi. Hello to you too. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's a share

1431
01:19:52,920 --> 01:20:00,120
I say show what's on your mind buddy? No rice. I finally got final fancy 12 rice princess cheering over here

1432
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:07,000
You finally that's right fall fancy 12 finally made its way to the UK shores this week and

1433
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,080
Thank you for not still it spoiling it because it's fucking epic

1434
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:16,160
I it is it is fucking epic in every system where you've probably actually played more of it than I have because my friends stole

1435
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:19,200
It there's one of my one of my friends will only play Final Fantasy games

1436
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,040
It's the only games he'll play and he took my PlayStation 2 when Final Fantasy 12 came out. Oh,

1437
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:29,360
Should be more for that. All right. Well, uh, you gotta take a moment to sell the you know

1438
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:34,920
The listeners who feel that orange lounge radio is too gay for their tastes then Final Fantasy 12 probably is too

1439
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:39,920
So sell our listeners on orange our sell sell our listeners on Final Fantasy 12 if you would

1440
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:47,960
Um, get it because it's like epic and if you play Final Fantasy 11, you'll love it because

1441
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:53,040
It's just fucking it's Final Fantasy 11, but with an actual story

1442
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:57,200
I guess rice princess made a face because she hates Final Fantasy 11

1443
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:02,480
I hate 11, but I love 12 because and there's a bunny lady named Fran

1444
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,760
She can look at her butt. So that's why you should play the game

1445
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:11,360
But Maury in our chat room says fucking epic is now my new phrase of the week

1446
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,440
Today's secret word every time you hear the secret word screaming out

1447
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,640
All right, so that's all you've been playing as fun as 12 non-stop

1448
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,160
Pretty much. How is the cosplay over there when the game came out?

1449
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,960
Did you go one of those midnight parties with the cosplay and all that stuff?

1450
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:35,860
Um, I went to my local Astra midnight and I was like two people queuing up for it. And that was it

1451
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:39,020
I was quite shocked. Don't you love how they call it a queue?

1452
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,220
Is he gonna go into battlegrounds? No

1453
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,260
No, we're just teasing

1454
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:51,300
Anything else going on in British news that we are might be overlooking what hey, I got a question for you

1455
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:57,900
What's a game that still hasn't come out over there that we have over here? That's pissing you off. Was there anything? Um,

1456
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:00,860
Supernova

1457
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:08,140
Dance Dance Revolution supernova. Oh, yeah dancing stage supernova cuz heaven forbid I say revolution in a British territory

1458
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:15,760
But oh, that's I don't know I could well why else don't they call it Dance Dance Revolution over there? I don't know

1459
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:21,900
Anyhow, um, well, they're really they have a completely different song list right station one. So I don't know

1460
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,580
Did they call it Dance Dance Revolution on PlayStation 1?

1461
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,140
Yeah, that's weird first mix

1462
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:31,300
What don't you get it like in two weeks? Like it's really close to coming out, isn't it? I

1463
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:35,860
Think so, but I don't know if that's a real release date

1464
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,900
We're getting a DDR

1465
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:44,500
Universe next week and I'm pretty excited about that. Yeah, I'm very excited about DDR universe

1466
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:49,260
So dancing stage universe should be making its way over there. I mean soon enough. I imagine

1467
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:53,860
Alright, well say sure we got to end our part a here and get into part B, but thanks so much for your call

01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,180
So, please don't get your panties in a bunch that you did not make it onto the show

1475
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,540
Because the phone lines will be open to get in part B. We just had a little extra time

1476
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,380
We want to make this part an hour and a half. So there you have it some phone calls

1477

1484
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:01,500
Of one of the hosts of orange lounge radio rice princess would be a good one to pick on cuz she'll bomb it

1485
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,420
She'll get one she eats rice

1486
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:09,140
All right, and I will tell you how you can be the listener that battles them very soon a little bit later on

1487
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:12,880
But for now, we're gonna take a break. We'll be back in a little bit with orange lounge radio part B
