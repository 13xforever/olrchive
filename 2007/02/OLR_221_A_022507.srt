1
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:26,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, February 25th, 2007, plenty of new games for the Virtual Console are discovered, some Xbox 360 games are getting a price cut, and one TV station warns us about sexual predators on online games.

2
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:33,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,891
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts.

4
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,032
[SPEAKER_07]: You might know me as Sky.

5
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:50,115
[SPEAKER_07]: If you play games online, you might see me post on forums.

6
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:54,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Not joining us tonight, sadly, is DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:56,960
[SPEAKER_07]: She had some prior family engagements to attend to.

8
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:00,363
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be hearing from her in a special pre-tape segment later in the show.

9
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:04,527
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've secretly replaced DarkSakura with a furry gay man tonight.

10
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:06,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Eddie.

11
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:08,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm yummy.

12
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:09,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Casper the Gay.

13
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I supposed to refer to you as Casper the Gay?

14
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

15
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:12,654
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's all right.

16
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:13,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

17
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:14,853
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you doing, Casper?

18
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:15,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm great.

19
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:18,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I came down here having a good time.

20
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:19,616
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember those old commercials?

21
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:24,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, we secretly replaced so-and-so's folgers with the new decap.

22
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:25,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the hell it is.

23
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like we secretly replaced Jamie with a furry gay man.

24
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:31,343
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll never know.

25
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:33,284
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

26
00:01:33,564 --> 00:01:36,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, also joining us tonight, the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

27
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:37,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

28
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:40,048
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did not replace him with a furry gay man.

29
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:40,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God.

30
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:41,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we?

31
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:41,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we?

32
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:43,652
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we didn't.

33
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:44,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, how you doing, Loki?

34
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:45,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

35
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:46,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good to hear.

36
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:49,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to see you're eating healthy tonight with the old Mickey D's.

37
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:53,918
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, their sweet and sour sauce tastes like it's been sitting out for a long time.

38
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:55,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes a little off.

39
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But that does not mean that I'm not gonna, you know, and I'm also disappointed they only got two packets of sweet and sour sauce versus three, because three's a lot better.

40
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't McDonald's have some stupid policy, like if you order Yates or any nuggets?

41
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:08,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but ten pieces, I'm supposed to get three.

42
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:10,905
[SPEAKER_07]: They fucking jipped me.

43
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you go in and ask to speak with the manager?

44
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:13,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't care.

45
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:14,786
[SPEAKER_07]: You can be one of those people.

46
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:33,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure anybody in our chat room who's worked for fast food in the past has some story about some fucking bitch who came in there because they wanted extra sauce or, you know, oh, you got to let the people at the drive-thru who order, like, I want a super-sized burger, chicken McNuggets, super-sized fries, oh, and a Diet Coke.

47
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:40,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even better, I want a six-piece McNugget with 12 sides of sweet and sour sauce.

48
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:43,306
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, it makes me angsty.

49
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:45,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes me angsty.

50
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:48,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Goddammit, that's the second week in a row that's happened with him.

51
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,911
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more than a second week in a row.

52
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:51,612
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been like four weeks in a row.

53
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing it on purpose.

54
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:56,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, say hello as well tonight to... Murder!

55
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Rice Princess.

56
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:00,338
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, Rice Princess?

57
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:02,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Now's when you're supposed to cue One Wing Angel.

58
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,301
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

59
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:05,242
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Rice Princess?

60
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:05,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing pretty good.

61
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:07,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm eating McDonald's, too.

62
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:10,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm eating McDonald's, too.

63
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:11,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this loud enough?

64
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:11,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, see?

65
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:14,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, tonight I'm letting you see the monitor so you can see what you're allowed to do.

66
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have a not-crappy mic to talk into?

67
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I hate yelling and making it sound like I'm falling off a cliff.

68
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:21,615
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

69
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:22,476
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, though, otherwise?

70
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:23,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

71
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:24,217
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

72
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:24,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

73
00:03:25,714 --> 00:03:27,836
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, also say hello to our chat room.

74
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:29,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Always another guest here on the program.

75
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:32,001
[SPEAKER_07]: It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

76
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, I'm in the chat room.

77
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:38,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed Tiger Claw in the chat room says, Sky, you do know the Oscars are on.

78
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:39,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

79
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:43,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, last week it was the Grammys, or two weeks ago it was the Grammys.

80
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:44,514
[SPEAKER_07]: This week it's the Oscars.

81
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:45,175
[SPEAKER_07]: We just can't win.

82
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:46,416
[SPEAKER_07]: We're always up against something.

83
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:47,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, but come on.

84
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

85
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,961
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be able to read it tomorrow morning who won the Oscars.

86
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:57,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's be honest, you and I both know most people listen to this show in the audio archive or podcast form.

87
00:03:57,745 --> 00:04:00,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And they can listen to that in the convenience of whenever they want.

88
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,048
[SPEAKER_07]: So it won't be up against the Oscars in that regard.

89
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to just keep doing the show like always.

90
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:12,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you want, I mean if you don't want us to talk about video games, we could just kind of like turn on the Oscars and just give live commentary.

91
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:14,513
[SPEAKER_07]: God, Kate Winslet looks fat.

92
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:15,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that be fun?

93
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:17,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see two.

94
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:21,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say Oscar chat real fast, even though we're supposed to be keeping the random down tonight.

95
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:25,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say I saw that Notes on a Scandal, which is the one that Judi Dench is nominated for.

96
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I went out and saw that last night.

97
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:27,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty good.

98
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Judi Dench plays a good, crazy old woman.

99
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:31,324
[SPEAKER_07]: She really does.

100
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope she wins, but I didn't see The Queen.

101
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:34,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear that was really good, too.

102
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,869
[SPEAKER_07]: But Judi Dench, has she ever been bad in any movie?

103
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:37,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

104
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:38,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think she has.

105
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,490
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

106
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Joshi16 in the chatroom has some harsh words for the podcast listeners.

107
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:47,538
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, podcast equals lazy fans.

108
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:50,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

109
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:51,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Burn.

110
00:04:52,156 --> 00:05:20,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's get right into how we always start off the show A little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week Where we talk about what we've been playing And usually our chatroom gets into it too Oh, first off, speaking of chatroom, I want to say hi to the new listeners I always make a chance to try to say hi to noobs that are in chat Little thing noob Misty's not a noob, she's a long time listener She's in chat tonight, she hasn't been there for a long time So hi Misty Frisbee, I don't recognize that name And if I'm mistakenly pegging you as the new listener, I miss you, I apologize My brain can only hold so much

111
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:25,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't recognize HeOn64, that must be new, so welcome.

112
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Proper T, RoboBoy, actually maybe there's been a RoboBoy before, I don't know.

113
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:30,593
[SPEAKER_07]: RoboBoy, I don't recognize you.

114
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:34,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So hi noobs, or people I'm calling noobs because I didn't recognize your name.

115
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:35,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to chat.

116
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:38,538
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of folks in chat tonight, a lot of regulars in there.

117
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:39,839
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate your support as always.

118
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:48,444
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, if you can't listen to us live because some of you guys have other things to do on Sunday nights like Oscar parties or whatever stupid stuff you're doing, you can always download our podcast.

119
00:05:48,786 --> 00:05:50,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Send us emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

120
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:53,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave us voicemails, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

121
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:54,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll shut up.

122
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:55,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

123
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:57,650
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was good.

124
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,290
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all crackdown.

125
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:01,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots and lots of crackdown.

126
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:02,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And the game is awesome.

127
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:08,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Except some co-op, depending on who you're playing with, I guess, can be very buggy or very laggy.

128
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:16,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I played a co-op game with Jeremy Todd 1 today, and yeah, it was pretty bad.

129
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:17,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I couldn't even...

130
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:18,702
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

131
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:42,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty fun.

132
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:45,338
[SPEAKER_05]: But the game itself is just really keeping my attention.

133
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:59,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping for some good download content later on because I think once I do finish the game and finally do get the rest of the achievements, it might just kind of crash for me because you need to have some really co-op stuff to be able to get a lot out of the game.

134
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,007
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's fun so far, though.

135
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:02,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

136
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:08,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, of course, the typical Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories.

137
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:13,097
[SPEAKER_05]: and my second PSP that I'm fixing.

138
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:19,823
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all fixed now, but I have to order a new faceplate button for it because I bought the third party faceplate for it and it sucks balls.

139
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:25,468
[SPEAKER_05]: So, always stick with first party stuff because the third party clear ones, they suck.

140
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's all I've really played other than, you know, just Crackdown.

141
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:32,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, kind of

142
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:34,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

143
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:50,818
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:16,449
[SPEAKER_05]: You can open your game up and then they can join it, but the inviting is broken.

145
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:18,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's supposed to be fixed in a later patch.

146
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:22,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So when are you going to let me play Crackdown so I can decide if it's worth the $60 or not?

147
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:23,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I still want to play it.

148
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:24,434
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

149
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:28,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're going to come over at some point and show it to me, right?

150
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:29,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it here today.

151
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:32,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I didn't get the demo, quote-unquote.

152
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:32,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get it.

153
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I suck at those type of games.

154
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:39,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can see my save game where you can fire homing missiles at people.

155
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:39,644
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

156
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, what else?

157
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,714
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for your gaming week?

158
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:43,176
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

159
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:46,026
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week was mostly World of Warcraft, as I said.

160
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:46,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Kid Icarus.

161
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,129
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot on Nintendo.

162
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, it's awesome.

163
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,911
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard as hell, but it's fun.

164
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:51,952
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the hardest game ever.

165
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:58,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, when I beat the first dungeon this week, I thought I was the shit because I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm over 21 and I can still beat the first dungeon.

166
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:01,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have some skill at this game.

167
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:01,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

168
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,260
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like getting to hear the theme.

169
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,604
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people have actually heard other music in the game besides the very first stage?

170
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:09,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot.

171
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:10,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

172
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:16,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people have only heard the first stage music, so it's kind of neat to hear the second stage theme.

173
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:20,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm sure there's a lot of listeners that are like, I already beat the game, Rob.

174
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:20,920
[SPEAKER_07]: What's taking you so long?

175
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm nine years old, and I beat the game like 500 times.

176
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:25,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing it.

177
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:25,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I was nine years old.

178
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I beat the game 500 times, too.

179
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:30,889
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, I used Icarus Fights Medusa Angels.

180
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:42,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, also, I went to the arcade this week, which was kind of cool because I had a date Friday, and he actually wanted to go to the arcade because we didn't really have a set plan.

181
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:43,914
[SPEAKER_07]: YoungSung is awesome

182
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:12,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

183
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:44,483
[SPEAKER_07]: No, to answer chat, I do not have a boyfriend.

184
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:46,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he listens to this once in a while.

185
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:46,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I went on a date.

186
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:47,664
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a big difference.

187
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:49,245
[SPEAKER_07]: God, anyway.

188
00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:52,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I shouldn't talk about my personal life on this program.

189
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you shouldn't.

190
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:54,207
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?

191
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:54,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I really shouldn't.

192
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I played Mario Kart Arcade, which was fun.

193
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:01,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they fixed their machine at Golf Land, and now the picture camera thing works again.

194
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:01,550
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of fun.

195
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually won the race.

196
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting good at Mario Kart Arcade.

197
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:05,991
[SPEAKER_03]: That must be on easy, too.

198
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:07,292
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we played a normal track.

199
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:08,392
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't play the easiest one.

200
00:11:08,412 --> 00:11:09,173
[SPEAKER_07]: We played on normal.

201
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:10,213
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I swear.

202
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that game's a waste of money, man.

203
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:14,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hokey.

204
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario Kart in the arcade does not nearly have the same magic as it does at home.

205
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:23,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you just take a picture of yourself and, like, tape it to the screen if you really want your face on the thing?

206
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:27,959
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be better if you had, like, eight of those machines.

207
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it would be better with the pictures.

208
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:34,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I could see, like, a Dave & Buster's having all these machines next to each other.

209
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:36,104
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I bet there's a Dave & Buster's somewhere that has it.

210
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,526
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you only have two, it is kind of hokey.

211
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,552
[SPEAKER_07]: and the game itself is not the same magic as the home.

212
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:42,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not.

213
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:44,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a whole different engine or something.

214
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:50,975
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to see the Mario Kart arcade, by the way, search for Orange Lounge on YouTube and there's a video of Loki playing Mario Kart drunk.

215
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:51,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious.

216
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:52,555
[SPEAKER_07]: At his bachelor party.

217
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:53,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

218
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:53,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

219
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:55,456
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to put more crap on YouTube.

220
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie, you're a camera person, right?

221
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:01,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have a digital camera where we can download stuff.

222
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:01,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

223
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:02,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Just took it up to the USB.

224
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:03,959
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to do video.

225
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:05,999
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to be like our official Orange Lounge videographer.

226
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, yeah.

227
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,660
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'll do.

228
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,500
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be rad.

229
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:09,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do that.

230
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:10,336
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on.

231
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:11,036
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

232
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:11,496
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on.

233
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:12,977
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

234
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's go around and figure out some other gaming weeks.

235
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:17,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

236
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:20,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, more wow.

237
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:21,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

238
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:23,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times on there.

239
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:31,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm so happy because, like, my 29 Rogue on Elder Thales, I got some poor sap to give me a plus 15 agi on my dagger.

240
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of expensive.

241
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just call it agi?

242
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:35,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Agility.

243
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:37,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Agility.

244
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:37,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Agility.

245
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:38,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it Agi.

246
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Agi is how you abbreviate it.

247
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:42,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Agi is going to be a punch in your face.

248
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:45,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Rice Princess, you make me lull.

249
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Rob, DF, please.

250
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:49,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

251
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Roltfulamow.

252
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:52,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Roltfulamow.

253
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:57,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Roltfulamow.

254
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:58,086
[SPEAKER_07]: JK.

255
00:12:58,887 --> 00:12:59,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

256
00:12:59,327 --> 00:12:59,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gosh.

257
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:01,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to leave.

258
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:06,816
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but yeah, it's pretty much been wow, whoop-dee-doo, good wow times.

259
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:12,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I played for about, I don't know, like an hour, hour and a half on Back Me Wool, and I did two quests.

260
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know why I went on.

261
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:19,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, man, and they were in the Barrens, so you know how you could do like ten quests at the same time in the Barrens?

262
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:21,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'll just not do anything.

263
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:23,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you got tied up in Barrens chat?

264
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:25,747
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I got tied up in Gchat, yo.

265
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:29,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, Guild Chat, let's not abbreviate that.

266
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:30,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please, thank you.

267
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:32,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Guild Chat, sorry.

268
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:34,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

269
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:37,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you actually sign on to the Guild and go, what up, G?

270
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,071
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

271
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:40,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, just curious.

272
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:41,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie, how was your gaming week?

273
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:42,434
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.

274
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been doing the virtual console thing, too, so I got Donkey Kong Country.

275
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:47,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, that game still kicks ass.

276
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:48,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that game.

277
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but it's not as good because I have GameCube controllers for my Wii instead of the classic controllers, and that doesn't work.

278
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:54,564
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's still fun.

279
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:55,862
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

280
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:15,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Genie Code or something.

281
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:44,715
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a normal NES... Wasn't Rygar so hard because you couldn't save it?

282
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:46,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you couldn't... Like, you had to do it in one sitting?

283
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:48,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there was a... Yeah, you had to do it in... You had to do it in one sitting.

284
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,699
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could only continue, I think, so many times, too.

285
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

286
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it was pretty hard.

287
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:54,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's how all games were back in the day, though.

288
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:56,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess.

289
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:58,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

290
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:01,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at what's going on in chatroom.

291
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:04,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Jvmon says, Sky, are you fucking with Rice Princess's volume?

292
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

293
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry if you are noticing audio problems.

294
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fucking with her volume as she's talking because...

295
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,838
[SPEAKER_07]: RicePrincess has a naturally quiet voice.

296
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to be loud.

297
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, am I, like, super loud now?

298
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:16,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can two people in China hear me now?

299
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:17,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're good.

300
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:21,845
[SPEAKER_07]: But make sure if Loki talks, he uses this mic and not the one you're on.

301
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:22,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

302
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:23,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

303
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:23,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

304
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:24,687
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

305
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:28,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I guess the guys in studio have louder voices.

306
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, not that you guys want to know that.

307
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

308
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:33,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

309
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:35,054
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

310
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:36,583
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

311
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Beat the Host Beat the Host

312
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:27,916
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's going to be killer.

313
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:30,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It's way harder than any of the others we've done, I think.

314
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:31,659
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some that are easy, but some are hard.

315
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,599
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll get into that in part three.

316
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:34,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like five years old when the arcade games were popular.

317
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, so don't pick me.

318
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:37,943
[SPEAKER_07]: You better pick Loki, I guess.

319
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,605
[SPEAKER_07]: He might be the only challenge in here.

320
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:39,945
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

321
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:45,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can pick Rice Princess just to embarrass her with her lack of classic arcade knowledge.

322
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:45,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So this will be fun.

323
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,591
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll see what happens.

324
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,371
[SPEAKER_07]: That would suck.

325
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:49,212
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

326
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:52,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

327
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,648
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a very well hidden secret.

328
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:12,709
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a little text drawn smiley.

329
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:15,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happens when you go into it, it's the Warp Zone.

330
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's this new area on the Wii called the Nintendo Warp Zone.

331
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:22,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And what the Warp Zone has is just like some trivia and cool stuff.

332
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,633
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now what they have on there is some little Kirby trivia.

333
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:30,195
[SPEAKER_07]: They have Kirby history and Kirby trivia, which would make sense because obviously the Kirby game... Did they get the Kirby game in Europe?

334
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:31,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Released on their console yet?

335
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:32,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we got it here.

336
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:35,957
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm assuming Kirby Europe, if they don't already have it, isn't far behind.

337
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:37,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And that...

338
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:45,400
[SPEAKER_07]: is kind of opening the potential to having this cool little, you know, Nintendo fan niche center that is possible to show up on the Wii.

339
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm betting if the UK has it, we're going to get it any day now here in the US.

340
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:49,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they also did a new channel.

341
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,302
[SPEAKER_08]: They did the Everybody Votes channel.

342
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:52,623
[SPEAKER_07]: That's last week's news, buddy.

343
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:53,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but whatever.

344
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,304
[SPEAKER_08]: But they could have that on that, too.

345
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you could vote on, like, you know, different Nintendo trivia.

346
00:17:57,445 --> 00:18:00,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what a lot of people are saying they should have done with the Everybody Votes channels.

347
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:02,067
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have had Nintendo trivia and stuff.

348
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, like, who do you like better?

349
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:05,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario, Luigi, that type of thing.

350
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:06,711
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

351
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

352
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,383
[SPEAKER_07]: The music in the forecast channel is off.

353
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, obviously I'm reaching, I'm sorry.

354
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:44,285
[SPEAKER_07]: JV Mon says, I use the weather channel.

355
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:48,046
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 is calling Loki the resident Wii hater.

356
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:50,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's not true.

357
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:51,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki loves his Wii.

358
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:57,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, yeah, I totally hate my Wii that I bought with, you know, tons of games and stuff.

359
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, you didn't have to camp out because of distribution, but whatever.

360
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,091
[SPEAKER_07]: That you got on launch day or before.

361
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,172
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you had your Wii like three days before launch.

362
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:04,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember going over there.

363
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:05,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

364
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,677
[SPEAKER_07]: playing that horrible, horrible Red Steel.

365
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:13,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't play Red Steel the first day, but you played it at the party, and that was awful.

366
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,379
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

367
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:14,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody cares.

368
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,100
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not okay with me.

369
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,360
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a horrible game.

370
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Horrible game.

371
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:24,242
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just Red Steel, because Red Steel sucks balls.

372
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:31,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, one thing that will not suck balls, hopefully, is going to be some Neo Geo and MSX games coming to

373
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:39,834
[SPEAKER_05]: The Virtual Console, and, um, the first couple titles, at least the MSX titles, um, and this is gonna be on the Japanese service, of course, for right now.

374
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:47,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Egi and Aleste are gonna be the first, um, MSX titles, and they're gonna be 800 Wii points each.

375
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, both are due out in spring.

376
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:55,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, hopefully we'll see some more, um, SNK stuff come over.

377
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:58,967
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, personally, I'd hope that for, like, Magical Lord, and, um,

378
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:03,387
[SPEAKER_05]: No Metal Slug, because my god, how many times have I read it?

379
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:04,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't know.

380
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:06,248
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Fatal Fury Special?

381
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:08,890
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my favorite fighting games ever, next to Street Fighter.

382
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you being sarcastic?

383
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,051
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I fucking love Fatal Fury Special.

384
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Fatal Fury.

385
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:14,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I like King of Fighters.

386
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Samurai Shodown.

387
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:19,394
[SPEAKER_03]: They need Samurai Shodown, because that was great, too.

388
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:23,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, or the best fucking game on Neo Geo ever, Magical Drop.

389
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:26,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Or King of Monsters, I think.

390
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:29,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, good times.

391
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:32,590
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very interesting, because did they say that at launch, that they were going to partner with Neo Geo?

392
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they did.

393
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember hearing about MSX.

394
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:45,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember MSX, which was very exciting, because a lot of people were going, ooh, now we can get the true sequel to Metal Gear and all that stuff that was only on the MSX, like the Metal Gear 2, not that Snake's Revenge stuff we had here in the US.

395
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just being able to play the original Metal Gear in the MSX format might be kind of interesting.

396
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:55,247
[SPEAKER_07]: They could retranslate it so that you don't have, you know, the truck have started to move.

397
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,808
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they should keep that in there.

398
00:20:57,335 --> 00:21:01,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, probably, I don't know I'm not really familiar with the MSX too much, so I don't know

399
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:18,708
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the name of that game?

400
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:21,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue's Journey or Blue's Adventure or something like that?

401
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue's Clues?

402
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,290
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

403
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,851
[SPEAKER_07]: We just figured out Blue's Clues.

404
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,392
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get off the show now.

405
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:30,253
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was the one where he had... Never mind.

406
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:31,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knows what I'm talking about.

407
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:32,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

408
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:33,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerks.

409
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:36,075
[SPEAKER_07]: What was I going to say?

410
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,936
[SPEAKER_07]: What else on Neo Geo?

411
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:43,058
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as we don't get 50,000 clones of Puzzle Bobble like there were in the arcade.

412
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Every year there's a new Puzzle Bobble and it's always the same damn game.

413
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:47,108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing.

414
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:48,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of that.

415
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I love, like, puzzle games and stuff.

416
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:53,793
[SPEAKER_07]: ShadowCharlie wants to see Super Baseball 2020.

417
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:54,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

418
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:57,336
[SPEAKER_07]: RobD wants to see King of Fighters 98.

419
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.

420
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of King of Fighters games, too.

421
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:00,979
[SPEAKER_03]: All the King of Fighters games.

422
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:02,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't mind seeing new ones of those every year.

423
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:03,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, seriously.

424
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:04,642
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

425
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:06,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they need to, like, keep making them.

426
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:06,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

427
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:08,205
[SPEAKER_07]: HitStun remembers the translation.

428
00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:09,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel asleep.

429
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:10,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It was I feel asleep.

430
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,249
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

431
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:13,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, HitStun.

432
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Gold star for you.

433
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

434
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:18,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's see.

435
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on with some other gaming news.

436
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:23,014
[SPEAKER_07]: This, oh my gosh, this makes me so excited.

437
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:28,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Square Enix is moving to put their first virtual console title on the Wii in Japan.

438
00:22:29,317 --> 00:22:36,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I tell you Square Enix is putting, unless you've already heard this, don't guess you've already heard, but if I told you Square Enix was putting a game on virtual console, what would you think it is?

439
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:39,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Square Enix.

440
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:40,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the original Final Fantasy, right?

441
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:42,243
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Eddie said in Final Fantasy?

442
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:42,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

443
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:43,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, what is it, Rob?

444
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god!

445
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:54,710
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

446
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:20,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those of you guys that are listening live tonight, you're actually going to get a treat during our break.

447
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,783
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't play it on the podcast because of copyright, but you're going to get Actraiser music during the break tonight because I love it that much.

448
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:27,064
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Sky, when's that coming out on Virtual Console?

449
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:28,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we don't know yet.

450
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:29,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

451
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:31,907
[SPEAKER_07]: We know it's going to be March in Japan.

452
00:23:33,268 --> 00:23:37,031
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's a good sign that it'll probably make its way over here, like end of March, April.

453
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:38,172
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

454
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:39,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so downloading this.

455
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:39,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Actraiser...

456
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Actraiser 2 wasn't even that bad.

457
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,440
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that they took out the simulation element of the game.

458
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,660
[SPEAKER_08]: The simulation was fun.

459
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was like a Greek, you know, you were developing a Greek civilization or whatever.

460
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:55,164
[SPEAKER_07]: But Actraiser, seriously, the only problem with Actraiser is that you can blast through the game in about four hours.

461
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:56,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe longer.

462
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:57,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe just about four hours.

463
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:59,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember beating it when I rented it in one night.

464
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:01,426
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty similar to a lot of old games.

465
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:03,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, especially NES games.

466
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:05,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you could get through them in a couple hours.

467
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:07,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's okay.

468
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:10,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so freaking excited.

469
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:10,947
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

470
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:27,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Actraiser 2 Actraiser 1

471
00:24:52,728 --> 00:25:08,415
[SPEAKER_07]: You had those, you know, side-scrolling action stages like the Ghosts and Goblins type theme with just this most beautiful music you've ever heard in a Super Nintendo game mixed with simulation scenes that are so different but they blend in the game so well because you get things in the simulation scene that you use in the action scene.

472
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:10,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, one of the all-time greatest games.

473
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:11,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

474
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:16,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, am I thinking of the right game where you're like an angel and you go and you like... Yes, you can see its little butt.

475
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:18,499
[SPEAKER_07]: When you fly, yes, you can see its little angel butt.

476
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Pervert, only you would know that.

477
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

478
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,981
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, hot angel butt.

479
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:29,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's, or like, I don't know, you're an angel and you're like planting crops or something like that, and you're like... Oh, really?

480
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:31,212
[SPEAKER_03]: In the side scrollers, you're a god?

481
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you said, Eddie?

482
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:32,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

483
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:33,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

484
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:35,414
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

485
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I didn't play enough of it.

486
00:25:37,595 --> 00:25:39,035
[SPEAKER_07]: No, yeah, that was the whole theme of the game.

487
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:39,536
[SPEAKER_07]: You were a god.

488
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:40,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

489
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:48,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And you had to go down to Earth to fix the suffering, and it's actually, actually, like, the music fits the emotion of the game, like, so well.

490
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I sound like such a ham, but it's true.

491
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:52,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's one of the early, great

492
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you cry?

493
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:56,764
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not at that.

494
00:25:56,964 --> 00:25:58,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I did cry at a Super Nintendo game, though.

495
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?

496
00:25:59,266 --> 00:25:59,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me.

497
00:25:59,546 --> 00:26:00,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not telling you.

498
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:01,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me, damn it.

499
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:02,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me right now.

500
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:02,568
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

501
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:03,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to punch you in your face.

502
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:04,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 3.

503
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 2.

504
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:06,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

505
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:07,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it because it was so bad?

506
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:12,196
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because I beat it, and the ending was so great, and then I was sad because it was over.

507
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:14,818
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, finally, I beat a game in my life.

508
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:16,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I was freaking like 12 years old, okay?

509
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:17,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't like bawling.

510
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like... It wasn't like when I saw Dancer in the Dark the first time, okay?

511
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:23,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like a little bit...

512
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:25,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sad it's over.

513
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:27,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Tear, tear.

514
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:28,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

515
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:29,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

516
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:35,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, well, if ActRaiser isn't your cup of tea, there's going to be some more stuff coming from Sega.

517
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, I want you to unsubscribe from this show.

518
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:41,673
[SPEAKER_07]: If ActRaiser is not your cup of tea, you do not deserve to listen to... No, I'm kidding.

519
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:42,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, I'm kidding.

520
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:44,154
[SPEAKER_05]: There goes all of our listeners.

521
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:44,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, guys.

522
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:45,535
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice knowing you.

523
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:48,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, some new titles from Sega.

524
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:53,739
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to see Sword of a Million, Vector Man, Sonic Spinball, and Beyond Oasis.

525
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:57,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So those should be coming within the next couple weeks.

526
00:26:58,424 --> 00:27:05,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was also some other stuff I was just reading here last minute from Hudson that was coming out on the Virtual Console, and these are also kind of exciting.

527
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:10,728
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be getting Double Dungeons and Splatterhouse in March.

528
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:12,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, Splatterhouse.

529
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:14,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, Phantasy Star, for real?

530
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:15,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

531
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:18,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Phantasy Star's coming out, too, for Virtual Console.

532
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:19,730
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

533
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Where'd you hear that?

534
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:22,331
[SPEAKER_08]: From the Internet.

535
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:24,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic Spinball

536
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,291
[SPEAKER_07]: because he mentioned it, is one of those games, like, complete opposite end from Actraiser, okay?

537
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:48,351
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those games that, like, you remember as being really cool.

538
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:53,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, oh, it's Sonic, it's a pinball game, and oh, I remember this game was just so awesome.

539
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,773
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you play it for five minutes and you go, God, this shit's boring.

540
00:27:57,933 --> 00:27:58,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it?

541
00:27:58,273 --> 00:27:58,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it just me?

542
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:05,554
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's kind of like you, like, when I go around you and then you start talking to me for about five minutes, I'm like, I want to go home.

543
00:28:05,574 --> 00:28:09,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Except not really, because I love you, Rob Hearts, to you.

544
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,336
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio you ever hear.

545
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:14,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

546
00:28:14,397 --> 00:28:19,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of people that shouldn't be talking more than five minutes at a time, Perrin Kaplan.

547
00:28:20,603 --> 00:28:23,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Open her mouth about some new things going on the Wii.

548
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:29,766
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I believe Perrin Kaplan also said that the GameCube had been ceased production, that there's no more GameCubes, right?

549
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:34,427
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it came out later in the week that, oh, just kidding, we really haven't stopped making the GameCubes.

550
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:38,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Perrin Kaplan is kind of like, I kind of treat her like opposite woman.

551
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:42,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when she says something, the opposite is actually true.

552
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,570
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this clever marketing ploy.

553
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anytime she talks, it's like, oh, introduction to the opposites.

554
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:50,548
[SPEAKER_03]: DVD playback enabled on it.

555
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:51,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

556
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:19,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

557
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:20,396
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean, oh my god?

558
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:23,938
[SPEAKER_07]: How many DVD players do you have in your house?

559
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:25,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Three or four.

560
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you need another one on the Wii?

561
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

562
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

563
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring the pink Wii out already.

564
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:37,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anyone's not buying the Wii because it doesn't have DVD playback.

565
00:29:37,184 --> 00:29:39,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's just a stupid feature anyways.

566
00:29:40,005 --> 00:29:43,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's kind of thrown in because they're DVD-ROM drives.

567
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Might as well just put the codecs in there.

568
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:49,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was popular like five years ago when nobody had a DVD, and now it's like, eh.

569
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:51,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

570
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:54,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, the GameCube didn't really play DVDs, so...

571
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:56,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Who gives a shit?

572
00:29:57,107 --> 00:30:02,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, SpeedyF40 says, the GameCube will live on forever.

573
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, because the Wii will play all your GameCube games.

574
00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:10,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, seriously, when I heard that the GameCube was going away, I was like, well, that makes sense.

575
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:18,759
[SPEAKER_05]: But the best part about the Wii playing the GameCube games, and I always have to explain this to my customers that are renting out GameCube games for the Wii and stuff, if you don't have GameCube controllers, you're fucked.

576
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I, third-party controllers.

577
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:20,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.

578
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:43,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, let's see, Actdeft says, who the hell listens to Perrin Kaplan?

579
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:47,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, look, show me five gaming blogs that did not run the story this week, okay?

580
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,848
[SPEAKER_07]: That run stories on Nintendo, usually.

581
00:30:50,108 --> 00:30:53,911
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is, is that whatever she says makes it onto every major gaming blog out there, so.

582
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:55,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And for some reason we posted that as well.

583
00:30:56,713 --> 00:31:00,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Joshi16 says, she is a classic Contrary Mary.

584
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:03,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never heard that term before.

585
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:03,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

586
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:05,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Contrary Mary.

587
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Contrary, Contrary Mary, I guess I'm putting it.

588
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:09,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Contrary Mary?

589
00:31:09,187 --> 00:31:10,948
[SPEAKER_07]: The emphasis on the wrong syllable.

590
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:13,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Did somebody say Contra?

591
00:31:13,928 --> 00:31:14,949
[SPEAKER_07]: What, did somebody say Contra?

592
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:15,569
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Contrary.

593
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, what else is there?

594
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, FootyMonster... No, I'm sorry, who said it was a selling point?

595
00:31:24,531 --> 00:31:26,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, somebody in chat room, I'm sorry, whoever said it.

596
00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:28,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, FootyMonster did say it.

597
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:31,293
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter, Sky, it's a selling point, talking about the DVD playback.

598
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:35,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just like... I don't know, who cares, really?

599
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:36,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they, I don't know...

600
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:38,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Fix their online!

601
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:45,117
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great, let's fix the online, something that we're actually going to use instead of... Let's make DVD playback.

602
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,237
[SPEAKER_08]: All in time.

603
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:49,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, okay, we've established that you're the only one that the messages don't download when it's off.

604
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,321
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it doesn't work for me either.

605
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:53,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It works for me, because I'm cooler than you.

606
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:55,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe because you have that USB, you have a dongle.

607
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:58,706
[SPEAKER_07]: You use your dongle, and the dongle makes it all work.

608
00:31:58,726 --> 00:32:02,269
[SPEAKER_08]: It does look like a penis for... It does quite look like a penis for the computer.

609
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:03,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, moving right along.

610
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so...

611
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:14,832
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're looking forward to more independent games on the Wii, they have this big program that they were touting originally, saying that they were going to fund a bunch of independent games.

612
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:21,075
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole independent developer program in which they would give them free development kits and that kind of stuff.

613
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the only problem is they don't have enough development kits to go around.

614
00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:28,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, they're also in short supply just like the actual Wii's are.

615
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:34,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So, a lot of these independent developers aren't going to get to make their crappy ports of games that they probably already released.

616
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:41,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the sad part of that is, though, for those that were wondering, where are the downloadable indie games on the virtual console?

617
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:47,631
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't even... They're just a... They're a twinkle in mommy's eye right now because there's no dev kits.

618
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:48,151
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

619
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:49,973
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

620
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:50,073
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

621
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:51,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Nevermind.

622
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,221
[SPEAKER_05]: on the Wii.

623
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:12,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's a game where you shoot chickens.

624
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:15,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, if it's like Duck Hunt with chickens, sold.

625
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:17,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, chicken shit.

626
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:20,724
[SPEAKER_09]: They can instantly sell that title if they just change it to Cock Shoot.

627
00:33:20,804 --> 00:33:21,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

628
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:22,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are you?

629
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:24,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, this is LankyStyle.

630
00:33:24,926 --> 00:33:26,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Long time no hearer.

631
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:28,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Long time listener.

632
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:30,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Long time listener, first time caller.

633
00:33:31,328 --> 00:33:35,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you've been on the show before, but not in its podcast form, so nobody knows who you are, in other words.

634
00:33:36,252 --> 00:33:38,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, I'm just the nameless voice.

635
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:39,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, wait, really quickly.

636
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:41,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Your three favorite games of all time and why?

637
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:42,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Really quickly.

638
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know what type of gamer you are.

639
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:50,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger, and... Chicken Shoot.

640
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,059
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

641
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:58,520
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, there you have it.

642
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I do cosplay.

643
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:01,861
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

644
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's a big fan of ActRaiser.

645
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:05,616
[SPEAKER_07]: He played Act... You just missed it.

646
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,437
[SPEAKER_07]: ActRacer's coming to Virtual Console in Japan.

647
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:08,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

648
00:34:08,397 --> 00:34:09,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a boat or two.

649
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:10,179
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

650
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:11,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

651
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:12,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

652
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:12,620
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

653
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,163
[SPEAKER_05]: No development kits for the poor independent folks, you know.

654
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:18,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor them.

655
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:20,963
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't get free development kits.

656
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:22,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

657
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:23,124
[SPEAKER_03]: QQ.

658
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,405
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says, crack shoot.

659
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:26,705
[SPEAKER_07]: How about instead of chicken shoot?

660
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:29,607
[SPEAKER_07]: If they bring out chicken shoot, I think there should be another mode in it.

661
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:33,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you remember how a duck hunt had the duck shoot and then they had the skeet shooting?

662
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:33,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Clay shooting, yeah.

663
00:34:33,928 --> 00:34:36,229
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have chicken shoot and waffle shoot.

664
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,452
[SPEAKER_07]: SpeedyF40 wants to see Cockblock for the Wii.

665
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:45,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting tie.

666
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:46,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that, what was that PSP game that we played?

667
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:48,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Cockblock for the Wii.

668
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:50,536
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that PSP game we played at the Konami?

669
00:34:50,576 --> 00:34:51,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Brooktown.

670
00:34:51,357 --> 00:34:52,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that kind of what?

671
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:52,738
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

672
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:53,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

673
00:34:54,118 --> 00:34:54,399
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

674
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:59,221
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just one of those games that's like, I'm so popular in the fictional high school.

675
00:34:59,842 --> 00:35:01,563
[SPEAKER_05]: If only it were true in real life.

676
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:02,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Stick it in the game.

677
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:04,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Stick it in the game.

678
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:07,506
[SPEAKER_07]: No, stick it in, comma, the game.

679
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:08,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

680
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:13,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevermind, like Oonga Boonga That doesn't even make sense, you wouldn't even put a comma there Stick it in!

681
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:19,005
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on WarioWare, Smooth Moves Is there a minigame on WarioWare, Smooth Moves, that's Stick It In?

682
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:23,350
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you stick in the game Remember that one where you pushed it on the Super Nintendo game?

683
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Nevermind Alright, moving on, anyway, um

684
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:40,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of the Wii, since we have a lot of Wii news tonight, this is also noteworthy, because Wiis are still very hard to find, yet they have outsold the 360 and the PlayStation 3 in January, and this is some preliminary data that made its way onto the internet.

685
00:35:41,258 --> 00:35:51,042
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii sold 436,000 units, 360, 294,000 units, PlayStation 3, 244,000 units.

686
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,523
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's only 50,000 units separating 360 and PlayStation 3.

687
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:58,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Then again, 360's been on the market for a year, so it doesn't look too good for Sony.

688
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:04,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony might need some games to come out pretty soon to rescue them, but who knows what's going to happen.

689
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:10,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Motorstorm's coming out in a couple weeks, and I cannot wait to play that average racing game.

690
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,319
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still fun.

691
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,440
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks awesome.

692
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on the show world tonight?

693
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:18,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we put Qbert or Flo or that stuff.

694
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:25,327
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we could take a moment to mention that Qbert and Flo made its way to the... Yeah, I heard Qbert sucks and Flo is short.

695
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:26,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard they redid Qbert.

696
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,108
[SPEAKER_07]: And I heard it sucks.

697
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

698
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:29,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Qbert.

699
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:31,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play it.

700
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:32,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you download it?

701
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I come over and play it?

702
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:35,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I want to waste that kind of money.

703
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:36,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on.

704
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:37,853
[SPEAKER_05]: You bought a PlayStation 3.

705
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:38,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, you didn't buy the PlayStation 3.

706
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,555
[SPEAKER_07]: You bought games for the PlayStation 3.

707
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:42,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

708
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:45,675
[SPEAKER_07]: You bought Ridge Racer 7 when you already had it when it was called Ridge Racer 6.

709
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:47,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, and it still sucks!

710
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:51,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bought Full Auto 2, and it's still Full Auto 1.

711
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,924
[SPEAKER_05]: They just put it in new packaging and added a crappy deathmatch mode, and I was a sucker.

712
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bought that crap.

713
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,148
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting some compliments tonight.

714
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Sasha says Loki is great this evening.

715
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And FootyMonster says Loki is picking up the slack for DarkSakura tonight.

716
00:37:06,873 --> 00:37:07,894
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like double pissed off.

717
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:09,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not pissed off, it's just...

718
00:37:10,965 --> 00:37:14,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate these games that they put out at launch, and they call it a sequel, and it's really not a sequel.

719
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:21,248
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's like fucking, it's like, a perfect example is, for the Wii, coming out next month, Prince of Persia Rival Swords.

720
00:37:21,288 --> 00:37:23,489
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking Two Thrones, all over again.

721
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:28,550
[SPEAKER_05]: All you need to do is tack on some stupid controls to it, and added chariot racing.

722
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:29,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, woohoo!

723
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:30,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Chariot racing?

724
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:33,512
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the only thing that was missing from the first one.

725
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:36,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, I really wish there was chariot racing in this.

726
00:37:38,143 --> 00:37:39,324
[SPEAKER_03]: They got my letters.

727
00:37:39,544 --> 00:37:40,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

728
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:44,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Raven's Dolphin in the chat room says, Flo is a beautiful screensaver.

729
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:45,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I hear.

730
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:46,670
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a screensaver that moves.

731
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,751
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all the reviews I've heard.

732
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:49,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's After Dark, the game.

733
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:50,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen.

734
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:51,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

735
00:37:51,495 --> 00:37:52,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, Sony.

736
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:58,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop making games that utilize this stupid tilt functionality crap.

737
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:00,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, to be honest, they're not that great.

738
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

739
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:06,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Flow, okay, that's kind of cool, you know, because it was a cool web game when it was free and stuff.

740
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:14,351
[SPEAKER_05]: But this, like, Super Rub-a-Dub or whatever it's coming out with the ducks, it's the same damn game again.

741
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:20,933
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like that other game that was out there right now that's kind of a clone of Geometry Wars.

742
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:22,354
[SPEAKER_05]: That one sucks, too.

743
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop releasing games.

744
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:25,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a stupid gimmick.

745
00:38:27,035 --> 00:38:29,376
[SPEAKER_07]: JeremyTodd1 in chat has some advice for Sony.

746
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:31,317
[SPEAKER_07]: This is sure to make the Sony fanboys very pleased.

747
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,888
[SPEAKER_07]: JeremyTodd1 says, I got an idea for what Sony should do.

748
00:38:34,368 --> 00:38:44,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Sony should go ride the rollercoaster of death right into the lake of fire, doom and torture, where its eyes will get ripped, and then they're forced to eat the eyes with a broken fork where they will continually watch bad TV shows over and over.

749
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:48,376
[SPEAKER_07]: You can address those cards and letters to JeremyTodd1, care of Orange Lounge Radio.

750
00:38:48,396 --> 00:38:50,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so more happy stuff, though.

751
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:55,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Elite Beat Agents is getting a sequel, which isn't too surprising because the game is pretty awesome.

752
00:38:56,315 --> 00:39:01,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, definitely... Actually, it is surprising, because the game didn't sell as well as they thought it would, especially not in Japan.

753
00:39:01,397 --> 00:39:03,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's Nintendo, they're not going to come up with anything original.

754
00:39:03,798 --> 00:39:04,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on, they still got... What?

755
00:39:04,938 --> 00:39:06,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you smoking crack?

756
00:39:06,499 --> 00:39:07,259
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the Wii?

757
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:08,359
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the Wii?

758
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,320
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean Nintendo's not going to come up with something original?

759
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:12,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let me see here.

760
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:17,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Another Super Mario sequel, another Metroid sequel, another Donkey Kong sequel.

761
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:18,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

762
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:19,463
[SPEAKER_05]: That's brand new shit!

763
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we got a Wii latest here.

764
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:33,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so Elite Beat Agents with yet more, you know, some different music because this is the natural progression of your, you know, music games is let's get some different music.

765
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:44,003
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not really specifying a release date yet, but they're saying that the new game is going to have four-player action and it's going to have a new snappy title.

766
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:46,705
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

767
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So I cannot wait for this game.

768
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,994
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're saying that the Japanese version is getting a sequel.

769
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:53,255
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know about American yet, right?

770
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:55,836
[SPEAKER_05]: No word on the U.S.

771
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:55,956
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.

772
00:39:55,996 --> 00:40:02,660
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, if it's coming out in Japan, they're going to translate it, so... Well, I mean, they didn't really translate Owen Don.

773
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,082
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of gave us a whole new version that was, I think, better.

774
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:07,123
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, depends what kind of music you're into.

775
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:09,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Eddie is dying over here.

776
00:40:09,124 --> 00:40:11,666
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants to share some Wii news that wasn't on our show roll.

777
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:16,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's an unconfirmed rumor on the internet, which is always reliable...

778
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:23,081
[SPEAKER_08]: The Nintendo's going to come out with sensor ankle straps so you can kick and dance and kick.

779
00:40:24,261 --> 00:40:25,901
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a bunch of bullshit.

780
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:26,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that'd be awesome.

781
00:40:27,162 --> 00:40:29,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if it's not true, if it was true, that'd be awesome.

782
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:30,342
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be so cool.

783
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:33,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Can anybody say Sega Activator?

784
00:40:34,924 --> 00:40:36,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega Activator.

785
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:36,864
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty easy.

786
00:40:38,244 --> 00:40:38,945
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that'd be cool.

787
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:39,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

788
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:42,446
[SPEAKER_08]: You could run and jump and do it.

789
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:44,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And do it.

790
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:48,230
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says that's fake.

791
00:40:50,312 --> 00:40:52,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, shot down.

792
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:53,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.

793
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:55,235
[SPEAKER_09]: They do have the penis sensor light.

794
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:57,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

795
00:40:59,097 --> 00:40:59,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead air.

796
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:08,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to point out, though, Loki, the Nintendo fanboy train is going by, and, you know, you're not on it.

797
00:41:10,724 --> 00:41:11,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sick burn, Rob.

798
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:14,347
Come on.

799
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:17,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, Loki, get on the Wii fanboy train.

800
00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:24,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we give him, like, a fucking, you know, soundboard, because we'd have stuff like this.

801
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:29,544
[SPEAKER_08]: No, yeah, because, no, Loki actually is a Nintendo... He likes Nintendo.

802
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:30,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I went over to his video game party.

803
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:32,506
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, like, all Nintendo, pretty much.

804
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:34,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so he's not against Nintendo.

805
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:34,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, now.

806
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm picking up, you know, SSX Blur next week.

807
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,252
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be awesome.

808
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:40,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really looking forward to that.

809
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:42,755
[SPEAKER_05]: But, to be honest, you know...

810
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:44,613
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

811
00:41:54,478 --> 00:42:01,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop releasing old ass games under a new title because they're on the portable systems now and on the Wii.

812
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,441
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a port of some old game that was out before.

813
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:06,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, it didn't sell well the first time.

814
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:09,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop trying to port it over to get some more sales out of it.

815
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:13,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially, do we really need another port of Driver Parallel Lines?

816
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:17,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, wasn't it bad enough the first time and now you have to...

817
00:42:18,284 --> 00:42:19,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Enhance it with some better controls

818
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:49,267
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so cool.

819
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:59,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the fuck, okay, why the fuck is he posting that in his blog and the other thing is, why the fuck are people posting it in their blogs?

820
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Like saying, dude, did you hear the guy from IGN?

821
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:05,931
[SPEAKER_05]: He heard that there's news coming that's cool.

822
00:43:06,932 --> 00:43:08,652
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck is that?

823
00:43:08,812 --> 00:43:13,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, you guys, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is coming to PartnerNet, but you didn't hear it from me.

824
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:15,174
[SPEAKER_07]: That missed our show role too, you know?

825
00:43:16,254 --> 00:43:16,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Owl thing.

826
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:21,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though we're not supposed to talk about it, dude, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is totally on PartnerNet.

827
00:43:21,175 --> 00:43:25,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, is this like the same guy that was the t-shirt dude from two weeks ago?

828
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:28,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think maybe.

829
00:43:28,158 --> 00:43:31,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's pretty crazy because you do the voice exactly the same.

830
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,420
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my uniformed straight male voice, actually.

831
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:34,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow, you do it really well.

832
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:35,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

833
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:35,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

834
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:39,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Rice Princess, give me a beer and make me a pie, bitch.

835
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:45,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say, you know, a lot of the stuff that's on PartnerNet that people go and report about, it's not really...

836
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that that Jetpack game that they've already announced is on PartnerNet.

837
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:14,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, you didn't announce the game.

838
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:16,022
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't give me any details about the game.

839
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:19,524
[SPEAKER_05]: All you said is you're confirming something that they've already announced.

840
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:22,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's awesome.

841
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:22,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

842
00:44:23,085 --> 00:44:25,406
[SPEAKER_05]: WarioWare Smooth Moves, it's in stores now.

843
00:44:25,726 --> 00:44:28,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I just confirmed something that they've already announced.

844
00:44:29,728 --> 00:44:30,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me my own blog.

845
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:34,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Joshi16 says, Attention, Loki.

846
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about attention.

847
00:44:36,971 --> 00:44:38,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, what else is there here?

848
00:44:38,952 --> 00:44:41,173
[SPEAKER_07]: NintendoManiac64 says, Breaking news.

849
00:44:41,213 --> 00:44:41,973
[SPEAKER_07]: There's news coming.

850
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:45,791
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says, Loki, free speech, anyone?

851
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, but I don't have to listen to them.

852
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:57,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, anyhow, we should move on to another story here, and this is like this ongoing saga.

853
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:04,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I thought we would have talked about this once on the show, laughed, and it would be done with, and I'm talking about level 30.

854
00:45:05,366 --> 00:45:07,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know when I say level 30, I'm talking about Bubble Bobble DS.

855
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:07,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god.

856
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:10,042
[SPEAKER_05]: BUBBLE BOBBLE REVOLUTION

857
00:45:24,175 --> 00:45:27,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a free copy of Rainbow Islands Revolution.

858
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:31,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I didn't even know there was a Rainbow Islands Revolution.

859
00:45:31,777 --> 00:45:32,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I did in no way.

860
00:45:32,517 --> 00:45:35,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually played the old school Rainbow Islands.

861
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:37,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I still play it today on GameTap.

862
00:45:38,298 --> 00:45:40,818
[SPEAKER_07]: And I could care less that there's this DF version out.

863
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:47,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I'm a Rainbow Islands fanboy and don't give a shit about this DS release, I can't imagine there's five people who bought this game.

864
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, you're getting this free game because nobody else wanted it.

865
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:52,581
[SPEAKER_05]: They have extra copies sitting in the warehouse.

866
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:52,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

867
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this atone for their sins?

868
00:45:55,846 --> 00:45:58,789
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all well with Codemasters now because they give you a free game.

869
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:00,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you gotta say, they didn't have to do that.

870
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just put it this way.

871
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:08,418
[SPEAKER_05]: They should really fire their marketing people because that cover for Bubble Revolution or whatever looks like crap.

872
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:10,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those dinosaurs look really fucked up.

873
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus, did they gain like a thousand pounds or something?

874
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:15,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jenny Craig, anyone?

875
00:46:15,845 --> 00:46:17,707
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a nice little letter that came with it.

876
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:18,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

877
00:46:36,915 --> 00:46:38,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Also for the Nintendo DS, so there's only one.

878
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:39,937
[SPEAKER_07]: So, oh, great.

879
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:40,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, great.

880
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:47,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got, you know, my Bubble Bobble wouldn't go to level 30, and now there's only one goddamn island in Rainbow Island.

881
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:49,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wait.

882
00:46:50,662 --> 00:46:52,543
[SPEAKER_07]: We've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island.

883
00:46:52,883 --> 00:46:55,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why they included Rainbow Islands, right?

884
00:46:55,584 --> 00:46:55,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

885
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:58,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Bubble Bobble really only goes up to 31.

886
00:46:59,465 --> 00:47:01,027
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're like, oh, you're going to be done after 31.

887
00:47:01,187 --> 00:47:02,628
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to believe you, Rice Princess.

888
00:47:02,648 --> 00:47:05,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I work for them.

889
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:12,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island as consideration for the length of time that you had to wait for the new cartridges to be manufactured.

890
00:47:13,399 --> 00:47:21,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Please dispose of your faulty cartridge by simply putting it in the trash or local recycling facility where one exists.

891
00:47:21,877 --> 00:47:23,298
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why it's called Rainbow Island?

892
00:47:23,618 --> 00:47:27,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they didn't finish the rest of the levels and you're going to have to send it in to get the rest of them.

893
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:30,100
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what you need to fucking do with that replacement cartridge?

894
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:36,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Return it to your local GameStop and get some money back because they're not going to know the difference.

895
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:36,983
[SPEAKER_07]: They got it.

896
00:47:37,163 --> 00:47:37,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

897
00:47:38,004 --> 00:47:39,184
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not dumb enough to buy it.

898
00:47:39,204 --> 00:47:39,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they are.

899
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:40,725
[SPEAKER_07]: There's got to be some way they can tell.

900
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:41,844
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're not.

901
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:46,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fine, take it back to your local, whatever, used game store.

902
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:55,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, stories about Bubble Bobble Revolution going on four weeks in a row make me very angsty, and I don't know about you, but that makes me want to bring on the pain with the FUs of the week.

903
00:48:05,475 --> 00:48:14,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, since DarkSakura is not here tonight, I will put in a preemptive DarkSakura FU to traffic and people and how she's busy with massage school and all that crap.

904
00:48:15,242 --> 00:48:16,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Loki, what's your FU tonight?

905
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:23,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have an FU, but I'm going to take this moment to let everyone in on a huge secret.

906
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:30,554
[SPEAKER_05]: There is some uber huge exciting news coming soon.

907
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:36,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tell you, once you hear what this news is, it's going to fucking blow your mind.

908
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:38,819
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so amazing.

909
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wish I could tell you, but I can't.

910
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,141
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, NDAs and all.

911
00:48:45,181 --> 00:48:49,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how they follow the NDAs when it comes to that news, but when it comes to everything else, you just kind of go, what NDA?

912
00:48:49,883 --> 00:48:51,743
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why?

913
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:53,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's no news.

914
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:57,445
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the same guy that said there's fucking Halo on the Game Boy Advance.

915
00:48:57,465 --> 00:48:58,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

916
00:48:59,106 --> 00:48:59,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, there is?

917
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, burn your Gameboy or Ice Princess.

918
00:49:03,381 --> 00:49:07,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, unsubscribe, unsubscribe.

919
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:14,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to give an F you to Whoppers, the original malted milk balls, because they are so addicting.

920
00:49:14,904 --> 00:49:19,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think my roommate did a bunch of them when I wasn't here, so F you to that.

921
00:49:19,305 --> 00:49:20,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't steal my Whoppers when I'm not here.

922
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:23,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me my malted milk balls.

923
00:49:26,347 --> 00:49:28,188
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare you take my malted milk balls.

924
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:28,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie.

925
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:28,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie.

926
00:49:29,864 --> 00:49:36,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to say an F you to all the garbage that I've been keeping in my closet because I'm moving and I have to throw it away now and I'm like, ah!

927
00:49:36,128 --> 00:49:39,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's taking forever and it's horribly bad.

928
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,611
[SPEAKER_08]: F you, garbage in my closet!

929
00:49:43,912 --> 00:49:45,013
[SPEAKER_07]: What else do you have in your closet?

930
00:49:45,173 --> 00:49:45,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing!

931
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:46,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess.

932
00:49:46,594 --> 00:49:48,175
[SPEAKER_03]: You already came out.

933
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:57,240
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the auction house on Elder Palace because you're stupid and you'd never have good leather headgear.

934
00:49:58,152 --> 00:49:59,053
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

935
00:50:16,437 --> 00:50:21,160
[SPEAKER_03]: But I call it, let's QQ more poo-poo, because it's funner to say, I don't know.

936
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,681
[SPEAKER_07]: What does even pew-pew mean?

937
00:50:23,161 --> 00:50:23,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Like shooting?

938
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:25,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Like pew-pew!

939
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:27,344
[SPEAKER_07]: But what if you're a warrior, you don't really shoot?

940
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:29,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Then punch yourself in the face, why the fuck are you playing a warrior?

941
00:50:30,606 --> 00:50:31,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Warriors are lame.

942
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:33,828
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be playing a rogue or a hunter.

943
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:34,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

944
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:36,029
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's it.

945
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Lanky style, do you have anything you wish to contribute?

946
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:41,553
[SPEAKER_09]: F you the Taco Bell, because it makes more poo-poo.

947
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:44,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, more poo-poo, less QQ.

948
00:50:45,706 --> 00:50:48,749
[SPEAKER_03]: In that case... Ew.

949
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew, ew.

950
00:50:52,574 --> 00:50:58,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of things that are pretty poo-poo, in my opinion, Alien Hamed is coming to Xbox 360.

951
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:01,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I did not like Alien Hominid.

952
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:26,489
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX Live Talk to 1UP Wing Commander Arena

953
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:55,021
[SPEAKER_05]: and nobody cares because it looks like shit.

954
00:51:55,921 --> 00:52:05,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone's seen the videos out there, but the Wing Commander that you've known and loved or maybe didn't like, this is certainly not the same game.

955
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:10,252
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, this is as much Wing Commander as Novodrome was Twisted Metal.

956
00:52:10,412 --> 00:52:12,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

957
00:52:12,494 --> 00:52:18,178
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, if you're interested, it's 16 players online and you can battle each other.

958
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:18,899
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be cool.

959
00:52:20,205 --> 00:52:20,825
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

960
00:52:20,885 --> 00:52:21,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, come on.

961
00:52:21,426 --> 00:52:29,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even though the game did not look like Wing Commander, like if you've seen the little game preview, somebody took the Wing Commander license and put it on some, like, random space shooter game.

962
00:52:29,911 --> 00:52:31,412
[SPEAKER_07]: But 16 people, come on.

963
00:52:31,872 --> 00:52:32,572
[SPEAKER_07]: That's gotta be fun.

964
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:34,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Was Novodrome fun with 16 people?

965
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:36,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Novodrome, no, you're right.

966
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Novodrome was just not a fun game at all.

967
00:52:38,096 --> 00:52:40,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so, it is coming out.

968
00:52:40,517 --> 00:52:42,318
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna have, you know, up to 16 players.

969
00:52:42,338 --> 00:52:48,042
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna have free-for-all maps, duly maps, team maps, blah, blah, blah.

970
00:52:48,522 --> 00:52:48,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

971
00:52:49,713 --> 00:52:50,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's great.

972
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:56,879
[SPEAKER_05]: There's videos online, YouTube, GameTrailers.com, so check it out and be disappointed.

973
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Boom Boom Rocket is really anticipated by a lot of folks in chat room.

974
00:53:03,144 --> 00:53:03,725
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks fun.

975
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:04,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It does look fun.

976
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:12,872
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I like DDR, and I did like Fantavision, so... Our old buddy Mel B's in chat and says it's like Dance Mania Speed meets Fireworks.

977
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:14,214
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Boom Boom Rocket is.

978
00:53:15,455 --> 00:53:15,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see a...

979
00:53:17,979 --> 00:53:18,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Video of that in motion.

980
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:21,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We see screenshots, but screenshots only tell you so much.

981
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:27,202
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that would be kind of fun to play Def Jam Icon with Dance Mania Speed as the custom soundtrack in that.

982
00:53:28,723 --> 00:53:32,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Any game with Dance Mania Speed as the custom soundtrack is sure to be hilarity.

983
00:53:34,305 --> 00:53:36,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that's not funny is my Xbox 360.

984
00:53:36,586 --> 00:53:39,287
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes too damn much noise whenever I'm playing it.

985
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:44,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, though, there is a rumor going around because, you know, when websites that are foreign...

986
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:47,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Release News, which is the case of this German website.

987
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:48,817
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only a rumor.

988
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:53,038
[SPEAKER_07]: The US websites won't believe it until Microsoft announces it.

989
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:53,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they can't read it.

990
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:54,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whatever.

991
00:53:54,859 --> 00:53:57,340
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, it certainly sounds like it could be a possibility.

992
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,441
[SPEAKER_07]: A German gaming website, what was it called?

993
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:03,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Cinemite.de or Cinemite, I don't know.

994
00:54:04,762 --> 00:54:15,065
[SPEAKER_07]: They announced that Microsoft has done a software update for debug Xbox 360s that reduces the speed of the DVD drive, causing the noise to go down.

995
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:16,833
[SPEAKER_05]: But the drive is slower then.

996
00:54:17,914 --> 00:54:19,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but did it need all the high speeds?

997
00:54:20,077 --> 00:54:20,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

998
00:54:21,229 --> 00:54:25,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, don't you think the update is smart enough to know, hey, when you need the high speed, use high speed.

999
00:54:25,592 --> 00:54:27,193
[SPEAKER_07]: When you don't need it, shut up.

1000
00:54:27,453 --> 00:54:29,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone really care how loud the DVD drive is?

1001
00:54:29,754 --> 00:54:33,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, to be honest, I don't really notice mine when I'm playing games.

1002
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:37,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're sitting there going, damn, my drive is loud, then you're going to die.

1003
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:38,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be honest.

1004
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:39,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I do notice it.

1005
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when you boot the system.

1006
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:43,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, when you boot and you're starting a game, that's when I really notice it.

1007
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:46,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, god damn, is my Xbox 360 going to launch into space?

1008
00:54:46,904 --> 00:54:48,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it makes so much noise.

1009
00:54:48,145 --> 00:54:49,806
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like...

1010
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you think they make up... Maybe it's just because mine's vertical standing?

1011
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:55,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1012
00:54:56,221 --> 00:55:00,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I think because yours is on a hard surface, and so it transfers the sound.

1013
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:10,948
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, if you put it on carpet, like I have mine right now, I was playing on my monitor on my computer, and so I have it sitting on next to my normal PC, and I don't really hear it.

1014
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

1015
00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:17,971
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I have headphones on, and I'm listening to the music and stuff, so... But...

1016
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, I don't know.

1017
00:55:20,535 --> 00:55:21,556
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a big deal for me.

1018
00:55:21,576 --> 00:55:28,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if it was like, like the whole time when you're playing it, then that would be a little different, but... That would just be really weird if they did that.

1019
00:55:28,878 --> 00:55:31,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the millions of unsubscribed clicks you were getting throughout the world.

1020
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so it's not a huge deal, though.

1021
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:36,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like a chainsaw sound or something like that.

1022
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1023
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:40,421
[SPEAKER_05]: People just need to quit bitching.

1024
00:55:41,141 --> 00:55:46,603
[SPEAKER_07]: SpeedyF40, OuchEars, GS68, LokiWTF, AlphaCanogram, DamnLoki...

1025
00:55:49,523 --> 00:55:50,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki needs a sedative.

1026
00:55:51,044 --> 00:56:04,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, Eddie was making fun of me calling my wireless headset a wireless communicator at one point, but I wanted to say during my gaming week, I bought one of those $20 things that you can put in your computer, what's it called, the gaming receiver or something like that, so you can use your wireless headset.

1027
00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:10,902
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome, because I can use my wireless headset on Ventrilo, and I didn't have to do any configuration on my computer.

1028
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:15,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Ventrilo just automatically knew, and the voices come through on the ear, and you can talk.

1029
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:16,326
[SPEAKER_07]: with the headset.

1030
00:56:16,346 --> 00:56:16,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

1031
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:19,347
[SPEAKER_05]: We should just buy a bunch of those and all do the show with that.

1032
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:20,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just do the show with that.

1033
00:56:20,287 --> 00:56:24,708
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's too bad, Rob, because the Ventrilo server doesn't work anymore, so you never go on.

1034
00:56:24,788 --> 00:56:30,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And Rob puts on a red mini Uhura skirt and goes, all hailing frequencies open, Captain, for lovin'.

1035
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody even understands that.

1036
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:34,591
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from Star Trek.

1037
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:44,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Thousands of listeners of Warren's, I'm sorry, hundreds of listeners after tonight, actually maybe 20 listeners of Warren's on radio after tonight, and not a one of them is going to understand that at all.

1038
00:56:44,814 --> 00:56:45,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well.

1039
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:54,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, one thing that's never quieting down is these stupid rumors about Metal Gear Solid 4 on the 360.

1040
00:56:55,552 --> 00:57:00,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet another one fanning the flames of this rumor.

1041
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:01,900
[SPEAKER_05]: There's apparently a...

1042
00:57:02,622 --> 00:57:03,402
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1043
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:35,287
[SPEAKER_07]: and also on this survey, do you like candy?

1044
00:57:35,987 --> 00:57:37,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like money?

1045
00:57:37,368 --> 00:57:42,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as Captain Obvious' survey, of course people want to see Metal Gear Solid on the 360, right?

1046
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:44,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the more games, the better?

1047
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:46,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Lanky Star, you're shaking your head.

1048
00:57:46,092 --> 00:57:46,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1049
00:57:48,213 --> 00:57:50,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I hate the Xbox 360.

1050
00:57:50,314 --> 00:57:52,075
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great reason.

1051
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you hate the 360?

1052
00:57:53,195 --> 00:57:54,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't hate it.

1053
00:57:54,476 --> 00:57:59,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't hate it, but it's not as good as like a DS or a Wii.

1054
00:57:59,218 --> 00:57:59,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1055
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:00,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Reasons?

1056
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:00,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Titles.

1057
00:58:01,496 --> 00:58:02,136
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what matters.

1058
00:58:02,776 --> 00:58:05,097
[SPEAKER_05]: 360 has got a lot of shit coming out.

1059
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:06,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

1060
00:58:06,498 --> 00:58:09,499
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it's good, you know, exclusive titles.

1061
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:10,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom Boom Rocket.

1062
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it like Boom Boom Fire?

1063
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom Boom Dollar?

1064
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,582
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm going to get one only for the Mistwalker titles because I'm a big OG Final Fantasy fanboy.

1065
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue Dragon.

1066
00:58:21,562 --> 00:58:21,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1067
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:23,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue fucking Dragon.

1068
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue Dragon looks awesome and so does Lost Odyssey.

1069
00:58:27,924 --> 00:58:30,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Lost Odyssey's a ways off.

1070
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,337
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not... Hopefully it won't be a lost cause.

1071
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:43,081
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but anyways, this comes from apparently an Evil Avatar forum post, so... Take that as rumor, I guess.

1072
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:50,205
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, I don't believe that such survey exists, but, you know... Evil Avatar's another all-game show, so we gotta show a little love.

1073
00:58:50,225 --> 00:58:52,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, but this is like a listener.

1074
00:58:52,186 --> 00:58:57,589
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't exactly, you know... But, whatever, I mean... It's possible that they're...

1075
00:58:58,507 --> 00:59:01,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they really need to ask people what their interest is in Metal Gear Solid 4?

1076
00:59:01,828 --> 00:59:05,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's like, would you like to see Halo 3?

1077
00:59:06,749 --> 00:59:09,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's dumb.

1078
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:13,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadowslayer says, my god, a survey, amazing, it's confirmed.

1079
00:59:15,171 --> 00:59:17,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was a little bit of sarcasm there.

1080
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:24,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of obvious, it sounds like Crackdown 2 has already been greenlit, and that gets a big fat duh as well.

1081
00:59:25,453 --> 00:59:25,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1082
00:59:26,587 --> 00:59:29,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe it'll contain the Halo 4 beta.

1083
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:30,790
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the joke.

1084
00:59:31,051 --> 00:59:32,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I read that joke.

1085
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:34,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I stole a joke from whatever the site, QJ or whatever.

1086
00:59:35,214 --> 00:59:37,696
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, come on, it doesn't take a lot of brains to come up with that joke.

1087
00:59:38,156 --> 00:59:40,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that the only reason why Crackdown's really selling the Halo 3 beta?

1088
00:59:41,098 --> 00:59:44,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people are actually buying it for the game because it's a fun game.

1089
00:59:45,622 --> 00:59:46,603
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of fun.

1090
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:53,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, if it were just for the Halo 3 beta, then you wouldn't see a lot of people playing the game right now because...

1091
00:59:53,522 --> 00:59:54,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo 3 Beta isn't out.

1092
01:00:10,536 --> 01:00:12,657
[SPEAKER_07]: A more believable functioning city.

1093
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:14,477
[SPEAKER_07]: The city makes the fun.

1094
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:19,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it comes to how you choose and approach your missions and so on and so on.

1095
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:32,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing is about Crackdown and they even were talking about when they were designing the game originally, they've made it to where they can add islands and add whole extra parts of the city that aren't in the full game right now later on.

1096
01:00:32,323 --> 01:00:36,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So this game can expand almost as much as like Oblivion can.

1097
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:37,265
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1098
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:39,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they go that route.

1099
01:00:39,872 --> 01:00:40,572
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be really cool.

1100
01:00:41,052 --> 01:00:42,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Chatroom is shooting down the whole Halo.

1101
01:00:43,213 --> 01:00:44,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I stand corrected, apparently.

1102
01:00:44,673 --> 01:00:46,614
[SPEAKER_07]: DDRDollarBill says, I liked Crackdown.

1103
01:00:46,674 --> 01:00:47,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Halo 3 Beta.

1104
01:00:48,075 --> 01:00:50,415
[SPEAKER_07]: JeremyTodd1 says, I could care less about the Halo 3 Beta.

1105
01:00:50,455 --> 01:00:51,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Crackdown is amazing as a game.

1106
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:56,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And DDRDollarBill confirms again, Crackdown is more fun than fucking Halo.

1107
01:00:56,798 --> 01:00:57,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

1108
01:00:57,698 --> 01:01:03,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to play the Halo 3 Beta because I'm going to be able to play the Halo 3 Beta, but...

1109
01:01:04,335 --> 01:01:04,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1110
01:01:04,855 --> 01:01:06,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not too excited about it.

1111
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:15,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just going to be... Everyone's going to be, I think, disappointed because there's been a lot of people who have done it really good so far and there's not really much you can innovate on.

1112
01:01:16,522 --> 01:01:21,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And this, you know, big secret X button crap or whatever that is, I don't think it's going to be that big deal.

1113
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:23,526
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

1114
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:24,627
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall see.

1115
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:25,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

1116
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:42,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So another thing that's going to be shown pretty soon is going to be Xbox 360's IPTV service, and they're actually showing it at the Connected Home show at, well, in Europe, of course, a brand new show down there.

1117
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:51,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks interesting, not really too much, you know, they don't really go into any details on it, but I guess it's going to have DVR stuff in there as well.

1118
01:01:52,556 --> 01:01:54,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that can give me more TV channels, I'm all for.

1119
01:01:54,737 --> 01:01:55,878
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know,

1120
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:57,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to check this out.

1121
01:01:59,438 --> 01:01:59,658
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1122
01:02:15,153 --> 01:02:18,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious about it, but I don't like the fact that you have to switch everything to do it.

1123
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:21,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to switch everything just to have TV on my 360, you know what I mean?

1124
01:02:22,296 --> 01:02:29,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's going to be taking place, though, the Connected Home Show, and that's March 5th through 7th in Olympia, London.

1125
01:02:29,718 --> 01:02:31,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see some YouTubage of it in motion.

1126
01:02:31,939 --> 01:02:34,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1127
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:39,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, something else very cool announced to the Xbox 360, price cuts for the games!

1128
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:39,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1129
01:02:39,942 --> 01:02:41,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, not all the games.

1130
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:42,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Platinum Hit series, but you know.

1131
01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:44,412
[SPEAKER_07]: We all like news on a price cut.

1132
01:02:44,513 --> 01:02:46,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, a lot of those are already price cut.

1133
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Have already been price cut, huh?

1134
01:02:48,046 --> 01:02:49,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they just don't have the new packaging.

1135
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:55,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, supposedly March 16th is the day that the new packaging will come out, but it sounds like a lot of retailers have been proactive about the price.

1136
01:02:55,835 --> 01:02:57,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they've already dropped the pricing.

1137
01:02:57,216 --> 01:03:13,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for the low, low price of $30, you can get Battlefield 2, Burnout Revenge, Call of Duty 2, Dead or Alive 4, Fight Night Round 3, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, Top Spin 2, or Rockstar Games Table Tennis, which I seem to recall only cost $39 in the first place.

1138
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:14,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1139
01:03:14,049 --> 01:03:15,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not much of a price cut.

1140
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:17,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And Top Spin 2 sucks balls.

1141
01:03:17,552 --> 01:03:17,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't buy it.

1142
01:03:18,573 --> 01:03:19,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty 2, Battlefield, etc.

1143
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Burnout, but Chromehounds as well and Perfect Dark Zero.

1144
01:03:44,962 --> 01:03:49,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And other regions in Asia also get 99 nights, which should be interesting.

1145
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:53,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Chromehounds, I do believe, has already dropped down in price in the United States as well.

1146
01:03:54,968 --> 01:03:55,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean...

1147
01:03:56,621 --> 01:04:04,743
[SPEAKER_07]: You can probably find that if you really... But keep in mind, if you want to have the best tanks in the game or whatever, the best mechs, whatever you call them, you have to buy extra stuff online.

1148
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:09,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wait for Armored Core 4 because this is the game that you should have bought in the first place anyways.

1149
01:04:10,665 --> 01:04:15,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a sucker, also bought Chromehounds thinking, oh, it's going to be just like Armored Core.

1150
01:04:15,306 --> 01:04:18,567
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Armored Core with anchors being dragged behind you.

1151
01:04:18,627 --> 01:04:22,968
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so slow and boring.

1152
01:04:23,268 --> 01:04:24,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Armored Core 4 is the way to go.

1153
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:25,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways...

1154
01:04:26,474 --> 01:04:27,755
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1155
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:47,844
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a big duh.

1156
01:04:48,124 --> 01:04:49,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So that game is going to be coming out.

1157
01:04:49,665 --> 01:04:53,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Mercenaries, if you don't remember, originally I believe was put out by LucasArts.

1158
01:04:53,868 --> 01:04:57,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was one of those games that you can... I remember the commercial actually for it.

1159
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:02,454
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all, you know, shoot people, blow stuff up again, you know.

1160
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:07,557
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of one of those sandbox type of games where you can just cause a lot of mayhem.

1161
01:05:07,697 --> 01:05:10,359
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will definitely be checking it out.

1162
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:14,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's set for fall, by the way.

1163
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:20,166
[SPEAKER_07]: A game that I will definitely check out is Elder Scrolls V, because you know there's going to be one on the way.

1164
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:24,547
[SPEAKER_07]: And Elder Scrolls IV was obviously an amazing game.

1165
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:29,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Bethesda has confirmed Elder Scrolls V will happen.

1166
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:30,150
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely going to happen.

1167
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:35,672
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no immediate plans right now, according to the studio's vice president of PR and marketing, Pete Hines.

1168
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:44,575
[SPEAKER_07]: But what else is interesting is that he says the possibility of an MMO is kind of a natural step for the series.

1169
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:46,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, very interesting.

1170
01:05:47,495 --> 01:05:55,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but what's interesting about that, uh, it's been bounced around, according to Heinz, but, uh, they will not move forward with it unless there's a fresh idea for the MMO genre.

1171
01:05:56,121 --> 01:06:02,125
[SPEAKER_07]: But, dude, I think opening up Oblivion as an MMO would, you know, or that type of game as an MMO is good enough, don't you think?

1172
01:06:02,785 --> 01:06:06,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, God, when that multiplayer patch hit, most people were like, this should have just been in the game to begin with.

1173
01:06:07,288 --> 01:06:08,229
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be crazy, though.

1174
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:09,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be interesting.

1175
01:06:11,131 --> 01:06:12,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I can't wait.

1176
01:06:13,008 --> 01:06:18,034
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know you're not going to see this game until 2009 at the earliest.

1177
01:06:18,454 --> 01:06:25,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's going to be when people are talking about PlayStation 4 and Xbox 720, whenever that happens.

1178
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:27,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Or whatever the fuck else they're going to call it.

1179
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:27,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll see.

1180
01:06:29,066 --> 01:06:29,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways...

1181
01:06:30,412 --> 01:06:36,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So, with Clover being dissolved, some of the members, of course, went on to create the brand new company, Seed.

1182
01:06:37,157 --> 01:06:41,300
[SPEAKER_05]: The other members stuck around and are now working for Capcom.

1183
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what are they working on?

1184
01:06:43,162 --> 01:06:49,606
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be seeing them working on Resident Evil 5, for one, and, of course, a brand new Wii game, as well.

1185
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:56,191
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's kind of nice to see Clover, because I know they were doing a lot of original IPs and stuff, and kind of

1186
01:06:57,106 --> 01:07:00,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Throwing that kind of creative side to Resident Evil 5.

1187
01:07:01,528 --> 01:07:03,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully this Wii game, that's pretty awesome.

1188
01:07:03,329 --> 01:07:06,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty sweet.

1189
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:08,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1190
01:07:08,631 --> 01:07:12,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess Clover, not as far gone as some people think.

1191
01:07:12,392 --> 01:07:23,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're gone, but it's like if you buy a company or something like that, a lot of times you'll dissolve the company and just say, okay, whoever wants to move over, we'll pay you to move over.

1192
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:24,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise...

1193
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:26,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Find a new job.

1194
01:07:27,037 --> 01:07:27,757
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like that.

1195
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:35,903
[SPEAKER_05]: You pretty much keep the same people, but... Yeah, you get the talent, but you don't have to pay for the spot, the lease or whatever.

1196
01:07:36,324 --> 01:07:37,585
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just cutting costs that way.

1197
01:07:38,165 --> 01:07:45,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that was the last story we had paid for Part A, but we're actually running a little early tonight, so I think we'll actually go to the Skype line and take some calls.

1198
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:48,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I covertly opened up the Skype line there and saw if we'd get any calls.

1199
01:07:49,053 --> 01:07:51,755
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll get some calls out of the way early a little bit tonight, because we're running early tonight.

1200
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:53,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1201
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:54,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1202
01:07:54,844 --> 01:07:55,464
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, Sky?

1203
01:07:55,484 --> 01:07:56,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm SpeedyF40.

1204
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:57,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, SpeedyF40.

1205
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't recognize the name.

1206
01:07:59,266 --> 01:08:00,086
[SPEAKER_07]: You must be a new listener.

1207
01:08:01,107 --> 01:08:06,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a new listener because I've been listening to the podcast forever.

1208
01:08:06,709 --> 01:08:07,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

1209
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:08,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new on the stream, though.

1210
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:09,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, welcome.

1211
01:08:09,971 --> 01:08:11,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the first show.

1212
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:11,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess live show.

1213
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:13,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the first live show you're doing, then?

1214
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:14,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, first live show I'm doing.

1215
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:17,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I've popped my Orange Lounge cherry tonight.

1216
01:08:18,554 --> 01:08:19,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.

1217
01:08:19,315 --> 01:08:20,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

1218
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:21,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1219
01:08:21,436 --> 01:08:21,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it hot?

1220
01:08:22,336 --> 01:08:24,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it as good for you as it was for me?

1221
01:08:25,061 --> 01:08:29,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it was probably better for you because I tried harder, but I'm sure it worked out for everybody.

1222
01:08:30,646 --> 01:08:31,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Speedy, what kind of games are you into?

1223
01:08:32,668 --> 01:08:41,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right now I'm playing Star Wars Deadly Alliance or something for the PSP because I got it through Gamefly and it's mildly entertaining.

1224
01:08:42,055 --> 01:08:48,241
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm playing some WoW and some Wii games, even though I got a topic for you.

1225
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:49,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what's up?

1226
01:08:49,982 --> 01:08:51,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the Wii is overrated.

1227
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:54,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Gasp, you're on Loki's side tonight.

1228
01:08:55,071 --> 01:08:58,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So you are not on the train tonight with everybody else.

1229
01:08:58,932 --> 01:09:00,532
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not on the Wii fanboy train.

1230
01:09:00,972 --> 01:09:05,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I... Oh, God.

1231
01:09:06,174 --> 01:09:06,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

1232
01:09:06,634 --> 01:09:08,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not on the fanboy train.

1233
01:09:08,214 --> 01:09:11,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the Wii is completely overrated because...

1234
01:09:12,364 --> 01:09:15,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I think it's just more of a party system, a fad system, if you will.

1235
01:09:15,745 --> 01:09:20,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Wii, I bought it the day it came out, and I'm missing my gaming experience.

1236
01:09:20,887 --> 01:09:22,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going to the PC more and more often.

1237
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:27,889
[SPEAKER_07]: But, Ian, what's interesting, do you think the Wii is going the way of the GameCube?

1238
01:09:27,909 --> 01:09:31,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I even, I love Nintendo, I would have paid the GameCube very similarly.

1239
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:36,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Although you had some phenomenal games on GameCube, you know, Resident Evil 4, it was mostly a party system.

1240
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:38,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Your Mario Parties, your Smash Bros.

1241
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Melees, you know, it was a party system.

1242
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:48,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it'll go the way of the GameCube because it has that quirkiness and it has games like, oh gosh, Warriorware, which is a really fun game.

1243
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely kudos to them for doing that one.

1244
01:09:51,581 --> 01:09:56,264
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that a serious gamer would be better off with the Xbox 360.

1245
01:09:57,044 --> 01:10:06,069
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't think the uber-cool Metroid or, no, no, the uber-cool super-secret thing the IGN guy won't shut up about, you don't think that's going to change your mind?

1246
01:10:06,809 --> 01:10:10,531
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think a DVD drive or anything like that is going to change my mind at all.

1247
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:21,143
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I totally disagree, because on the Twilight Princess, I think that was a perfect marriage of classic, sort of old-school styling with combining some of the wee elements to make it more immersive.

1248
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:22,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, give me a break.

1249
01:10:22,763 --> 01:10:24,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Twilight Princess sucked.

1250
01:10:24,084 --> 01:10:25,484
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not as good as it could have been.

1251
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:28,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It was developed for the GameCube, and it showed.

1252
01:10:28,605 --> 01:10:29,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely showed.

1253
01:10:29,365 --> 01:10:35,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I think it showed that it can do a classic-style game and still be awesome.

1254
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:38,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It could do a classic style game when it's a freaking port.

1255
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:46,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Twilight Princess was entertaining because it was Zelda, but I don't think it was any better than any other platformer could have been.

1256
01:10:47,168 --> 01:10:48,629
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no huge breakthrough.

1257
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:52,472
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, our chat room, very polarized on the same topic.

1258
01:10:52,512 --> 01:10:54,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Jvmon says Twilight Princess was overrated.

1259
01:10:54,874 --> 01:10:57,276
[SPEAKER_07]: ShadowNextGen says, I love Twilight Princess.

1260
01:10:58,357 --> 01:11:01,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Jvmon also says, Twilight Princess showed fanboys will love anything.

1261
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:02,501
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1262
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:03,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Wind Waker a lot better.

1263
01:11:04,578 --> 01:11:05,299
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1264
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:06,260
[SPEAKER_07]: You're smoking crack!

1265
01:11:23,485 --> 01:11:31,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, why the fuck did they just not make it like a remake of, you know, Link to the Past or something like that with that kind of style of graphics?

1266
01:11:31,431 --> 01:11:34,954
[SPEAKER_07]: This coming from the person who was criticizing Nintendo early in the show for doing too damn many remakes.

1267
01:11:36,142 --> 01:11:36,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1268
01:11:36,742 --> 01:11:37,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1269
01:11:37,302 --> 01:11:37,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Pwned!

1270
01:11:38,022 --> 01:11:39,103
[SPEAKER_05]: No, here's what I'm saying, though.

1271
01:11:39,203 --> 01:11:45,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't necessarily want them to do an actual remake, but I just wanted it to actually be in Hyrule instead of in the ocean.

1272
01:11:45,804 --> 01:11:49,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because I would have rather had, you know, more land and stuff like that and run around like that.

1273
01:11:50,425 --> 01:11:51,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind the art style.

1274
01:11:51,585 --> 01:11:52,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was kind of different.

1275
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:55,446
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you got used to it, and it kind of worked.

1276
01:11:55,906 --> 01:12:03,148
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just... And then, now I'm playing, you know, Twilight Princess, and I lost interest in like an hour, so...

1277
01:12:04,648 --> 01:12:05,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Same here, Loki.

1278
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:05,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Same here.

1279
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:06,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it.

1280
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:08,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get why everyone brings us a 10.

1281
01:12:08,394 --> 01:12:09,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't that great.

1282
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:10,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you play through the whole game, though?

1283
01:12:11,218 --> 01:12:11,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Twilight Princess?

1284
01:12:11,879 --> 01:12:12,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1285
01:12:12,811 --> 01:12:16,132
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I... Well, if the game sucks, Eddie, you're not going to play through it.

1286
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:20,333
[SPEAKER_08]: No, yeah, no, the first... I mean, the story doesn't really start developing right away, though.

1287
01:12:20,353 --> 01:12:24,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, once you get into it, I mean, it's like... It's the first... To me, it's the only true sequel to Ocarina of Time.

1288
01:12:25,294 --> 01:12:27,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, once you get into it, like, it's really cool.

1289
01:12:27,414 --> 01:12:29,634
[SPEAKER_08]: They start touching base with all the old Ocarina of Time stuff.

1290
01:12:29,654 --> 01:12:31,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even care about Ocarina of Time, though.

1291
01:12:31,455 --> 01:12:31,935
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's a thing.

1292
01:12:32,075 --> 01:12:32,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

1293
01:12:32,475 --> 01:12:33,575
[SPEAKER_08]: See, you're not even a Zelda fan, then.

1294
01:12:33,635 --> 01:12:38,336
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, the beautiful part of Orange Lounge Radio is that everybody is entitled to their own opinion, even when they're wrong.

1295
01:12:39,596 --> 01:12:39,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1296
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:42,497
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Speedy, anything else you want to share with us tonight?

1297
01:12:43,143 --> 01:12:46,846
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura had family obligations tonight, so you get the fuzzy gay man instead.

1298
01:13:12,276 --> 01:13:12,776
[SPEAKER_01]: and Rice Princess.

1299
01:13:12,796 --> 01:13:13,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, I'll deal.

1300
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:14,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, yeah, you'll deal.

1301
01:13:14,497 --> 01:13:18,578
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually, but DarkSakura is going to be in a tape segment next, so you will get some DarkSakura love in this show.

1302
01:13:18,998 --> 01:13:19,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.

1303
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:21,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to meet some DarkSakura.

1304
01:13:21,218 --> 01:13:24,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, at WC Radio, aren't all your shows, like, dominating Dig right now?

1305
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:26,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we started a few.

1306
01:13:26,599 --> 01:13:26,819
[SPEAKER_01]: You suck.

1307
01:13:26,839 --> 01:13:28,100
[SPEAKER_07]: You're outranking us right now.

1308
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

1309
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:29,940
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1310
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Go dig Orange Launch Radio.

1311
01:13:31,601 --> 01:13:33,301
[SPEAKER_01]: They got everybody started with podcasts.

1312
01:13:33,401 --> 01:13:34,001
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

1313
01:13:34,221 --> 01:13:35,942
[SPEAKER_07]: WC Radio's an independent thing, right?

1314
01:13:36,402 --> 01:13:37,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1315
01:13:37,602 --> 01:13:38,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for it.

1316
01:13:38,802 --> 01:13:39,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for it.

1317
01:13:39,763 --> 01:13:40,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Indie radio all the way.

1318
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:41,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

1319
01:13:42,139 --> 01:13:44,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're over there, you know, go check out WC Radio stuff.

1320
01:13:44,459 --> 01:13:48,560
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, big Orange Lounge Radio, because give them justice, guys, seriously.

1321
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:51,881
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fan saying this, a hardcore OLI fan.

1322
01:13:52,701 --> 01:13:54,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I should just let this guy talk forever.

1323
01:13:54,341 --> 01:13:55,281
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like inflating my ego.

1324
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:56,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even going to be able to get out the door.

1325
01:13:57,822 --> 01:14:01,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, no, but really, I do love the show, and I don't want to get all mushy on air.

1326
01:14:01,462 --> 01:14:02,603
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep up the good work.

1327
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be listening.

1328
01:14:03,363 --> 01:14:03,643
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's okay.

1329
01:14:03,663 --> 01:14:04,343
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a little mushy.

1330
01:14:04,363 --> 01:14:04,643
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

1331
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:05,383
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, no.

1332
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:07,244
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate the call, of course, Speedy.

1333
01:14:07,824 --> 01:14:09,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great day, even if you do hate the Wii, okay?

1334
01:14:10,382 --> 01:14:11,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I don't hate the Wii.

1335
01:14:11,723 --> 01:14:12,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I know, I know.

1336
01:14:12,623 --> 01:14:14,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the DS was when it first came out.

1337
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:17,485
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of games that was like, eh, who gives a shit, you know?

1338
01:14:17,505 --> 01:14:18,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo got them right.

1339
01:14:19,306 --> 01:14:20,066
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a fad.

1340
01:14:20,246 --> 01:14:21,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, but you know, it's a third party.

1341
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:25,389
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll agree, the third party games on the Wii do kind of suck, but... Just give it time, it'll be good.

1342
01:14:25,689 --> 01:14:30,111
[SPEAKER_05]: EA, I think EA's got their game right now, so... He doesn't like the Wii?

1343
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:31,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude!

1344
01:14:31,831 --> 01:14:33,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to five minutes ago.

1345
01:14:33,472 --> 01:14:34,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't walk out of the room, ever.

1346
01:14:34,773 --> 01:14:35,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1347
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:39,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Speedy, we gotta go take other calls, but thanks so much for your call and best of luck with WC Radio.

1348
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:41,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you very much.

1349
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:43,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I tell everybody at WC Radio we said hey.

1350
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:44,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, hey.

1351
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:44,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

1352
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1353
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:46,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

1354
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:48,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like on Facebook, you poke them.

1355
01:14:49,724 --> 01:14:52,846
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sending WC Radio a poke right now.

1356
01:14:53,026 --> 01:14:53,787
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll send them a poke.

1357
01:14:54,688 --> 01:14:55,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddammit, Eddie, give it to me.

1358
01:14:56,369 --> 01:14:56,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, or don't.

1359
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:58,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew, that sounded terrible.

1360
01:14:59,011 --> 01:14:59,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, not like that.

1361
01:15:00,892 --> 01:15:01,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

1362
01:15:01,153 --> 01:15:02,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew, fish.

1363
01:15:03,194 --> 01:15:06,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Facebook is weird because weird random people are adding me now.

1364
01:15:06,657 --> 01:15:08,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I don't go to Skolody or anything.

1365
01:15:08,198 --> 01:15:08,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Who the fuck are you?

1366
01:15:10,607 --> 01:15:15,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, WC, not WC Radio, maybe they're on Facebook, but Orange Launch Radio is also on Facebook.

1367
01:15:15,789 --> 01:15:16,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I should give that a plug.

1368
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:17,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Search for OL Army.

1369
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:18,870
[SPEAKER_07]: We have another call.

1370
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:19,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1371
01:15:19,691 --> 01:15:19,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1372
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:23,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is Alex Kidd from a former Sega fame.

1373
01:15:23,532 --> 01:15:24,032
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

1374
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:25,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Alex Kidd.

1375
01:15:25,893 --> 01:15:27,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, I'm really sorry to hear about your career.

1376
01:15:27,494 --> 01:15:28,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever happened to you?

1377
01:15:29,095 --> 01:15:32,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I retired in 1990, and rather, I didn't retire.

1378
01:15:32,256 --> 01:15:33,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I got fired by Sega.

1379
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:36,157
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to bring in that stupid fucking rodent, Sonic.

1380
01:15:36,718 --> 01:15:37,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're all familiar with him.

1381
01:15:38,038 --> 01:15:38,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

1382
01:15:38,798 --> 01:15:40,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you bitter at all about that?

1383
01:15:40,715 --> 01:15:42,657
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because here's what I think.

1384
01:15:43,217 --> 01:15:49,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's only had one good game in the past five years, so I think it's high time that Sega brings me back.

1385
01:15:49,442 --> 01:15:52,144
[SPEAKER_06]: They're bringing back all the classic stuff with Nintendo.

1386
01:15:52,324 --> 01:15:53,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't they bring me back?

1387
01:15:53,264 --> 01:15:54,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you written Sega?

1388
01:15:54,685 --> 01:15:58,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you talked to your people to talk to Sega's people about making a classic come back?

1389
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:05,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been writing them for years, and I had a restraining order like six years ago, but that's expired now.

1390
01:16:05,934 --> 01:16:06,454
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell did you do?

1391
01:16:06,474 --> 01:16:08,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you send Shinobi World after them?

1392
01:16:08,115 --> 01:16:08,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what the hell happened?

1393
01:16:09,993 --> 01:16:18,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, like, Shinobi World was like the last thing I ever did, and then they just threw this hedgehog at me, and I couldn't compete.

1394
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:26,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, DM it, or, I mean, Alex Kidd, you certainly don't know how to play this game, do you?

1395
01:16:26,324 --> 01:16:27,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really bad at this game.

1396
01:16:27,425 --> 01:16:30,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex Kidd, you didn't have blast processing.

1397
01:16:32,364 --> 01:16:40,810
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I mean, look, I could go on the 360 and sell 10 times more copies, which would be 10 copies of the Sonic the Hedgehog game.

1398
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:47,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, Alex Kidd, is there a way we would see you on a virtual console at some point?

1399
01:16:48,715 --> 01:16:49,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1400
01:16:50,637 --> 01:16:51,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to.

1401
01:16:51,978 --> 01:16:59,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I started writing to Nintendo and I started telling them, you know, bring back those Master System games because nobody played them because your system kicked our system's ass.

1402
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:00,784
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened there?

1403
01:17:01,805 --> 01:17:03,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't you go to Nintendo?

1404
01:17:03,026 --> 01:17:06,089
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's where you're feeling the love, Alex, why didn't you go over to Nintendo?

1405
01:17:06,669 --> 01:17:12,314
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, at the time, it was Hiroshi Yamauchi, and he gave me the finger.

1406
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:18,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you mean he gave you rock, and you had scissors?

1407
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:20,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1408
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:26,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, Alex, that was the worst part of your fucking game.

1409
01:17:26,741 --> 01:17:29,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Who thought of putting rock, paper, scissors in a video game?

1410
01:17:29,764 --> 01:17:33,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm going to spend money on a video game so I can play rock, paper, scissors.

1411
01:17:34,468 --> 01:17:36,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever fucking play Tecmo Bowl?

1412
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:37,531
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same fucking thing.

1413
01:17:37,871 --> 01:17:39,152
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking rock, paper, scissors.

1414
01:17:39,192 --> 01:17:40,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex, kid, you got a dirty mouth.

1415
01:17:41,214 --> 01:17:42,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to wash your mouth.

1416
01:17:42,415 --> 01:17:42,875
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1417
01:17:42,895 --> 01:17:43,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck this.

1418
01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:44,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm giving it back to my buddy, DMN.

1419
01:17:44,997 --> 01:17:45,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

1420
01:17:45,658 --> 01:17:47,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, big jerk.

1421
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a multiple personality disorder live on the air.

1422
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that, guys.

1423
01:17:59,868 --> 01:18:02,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you kind of look like Alex Kidd without glasses.

1424
01:18:02,669 --> 01:18:03,230
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.

1425
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:05,151
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, DMN?

1426
01:18:06,272 --> 01:18:06,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

1427
01:18:07,132 --> 01:18:08,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex Kidd came over and wanted a call.

1428
01:18:08,813 --> 01:18:09,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It was frightening.

1429
01:18:09,954 --> 01:18:11,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so I can hang up on you then?

1430
01:18:11,515 --> 01:18:14,457
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I actually have a guest announcement for STFU next week.

1431
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:18,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, who's on STFU Thursday nights here on OLR?

1432
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Your buddy Loki, actually.

1433
01:18:19,901 --> 01:18:20,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1434
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:20,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1435
01:18:20,643 --> 01:18:20,843
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1436
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:21,143
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1437
01:18:50,936 --> 01:18:51,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Who said that?

1438
01:18:51,597 --> 01:18:51,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait.

1439
01:18:52,017 --> 01:18:52,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Who said that?

1440
01:18:52,777 --> 01:18:53,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny Dale.

1441
01:18:53,718 --> 01:18:54,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, hold on a second here.

1442
01:18:54,878 --> 01:18:56,939
[SPEAKER_07]: No kicking Funny Dale because you disagree with him.

1443
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:58,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1444
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,681
[SPEAKER_07]: No kicking Funny Dale because you disagree with him.

1445
01:19:01,722 --> 01:19:02,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1446
01:19:03,262 --> 01:19:06,724
[SPEAKER_07]: TheRobD says, I believe Derek H. said he's too straight to listen to OLR.

1447
01:19:08,825 --> 01:19:09,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1448
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:16,669
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't know what we're talking about, it's a reference to one of our sister programs, All Games Interactive.

1449
01:19:17,571 --> 01:19:19,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Brother, Sister, Inbred Cousin, whatever you want to say.

1450
01:19:19,952 --> 01:19:21,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm too straight to listen to that one line.

1451
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:23,173
[SPEAKER_07]: DMN, any quick thoughts?

1452
01:19:23,193 --> 01:19:24,634
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take one more call before we take a break here.

1453
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:28,956
[SPEAKER_06]: You should play Luminous Live because it's pretty fun and it's $20.

1454
01:19:30,656 --> 01:19:33,498
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have Luminous... Not Luminous Live, sorry, Luminous Plus.

1455
01:19:34,078 --> 01:19:35,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Luminous on Xbox 360.

1456
01:19:35,598 --> 01:19:35,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need it.

1457
01:19:36,579 --> 01:19:37,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Luminous Plus, $20.

1458
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,460
[SPEAKER_07]: That's $20 you ever spend.

1459
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:40,740
[SPEAKER_07]: You're wrong, but have a nice day anyway.

1460
01:19:40,961 --> 01:19:41,781
[SPEAKER_06]: You're wrong, shut up.

1461
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:44,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I love hanging up on him.

1462
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:45,262
[SPEAKER_07]: One more call.

1463
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:46,803
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go over here.

1464
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, hello to you too.

1465
01:19:50,142 --> 01:19:50,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1466
01:19:50,962 --> 01:19:51,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1467
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Seisho.

1468
01:19:53,325 --> 01:19:54,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Seisho.

1469
01:19:54,205 --> 01:19:55,046
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1470
01:19:55,867 --> 01:19:58,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got Final Fantasy XII.

1471
01:19:58,509 --> 01:20:00,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess is cheering over here.

1472
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:02,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, nice British guy.

1473
01:20:03,834 --> 01:20:06,576
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, Final Fantasy XII finally made its way to the UK shores this week.

1474
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:11,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for not spoiling it because it's fucking epic.

1475
01:20:11,865 --> 01:20:13,586
[SPEAKER_07]: It is fucking epic in every sense of the word.

1476
01:20:13,606 --> 01:20:16,988
[SPEAKER_07]: You've probably actually played more of it than I have because my friend stole it.

1477
01:20:17,049 --> 01:20:19,210
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my friends will only play Final Fantasy games.

1478
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the only games he'll play.

1479
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:22,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And he took my PlayStation 2 when Final Fantasy XII came out.

1480
01:20:23,473 --> 01:20:25,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I should beat him up for that.

1481
01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:25,754
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1482
01:20:25,794 --> 01:20:32,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you've got to take a moment to sell the listeners who feel that Orange Lounge Radio is too gay for their tastes.

1483
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:35,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Final Fantasy XII probably is too.

1484
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:38,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So sell our listeners on Final Fantasy XII if you would.

1485
01:20:41,289 --> 01:21:06,890
[SPEAKER_04]: um get it because it's like epic and if you play Final Fantasy XI you'll love it because it's just fucking it's Final Fantasy XI but with an actual story I guess RisePrincess made a face because she hates Final Fantasy XI I hate XI but I love XII and there's a bunny lady named Fran and she's hot and she's wearing a thong and you can look at her butt so that's why you should play the game

1486
01:21:08,002 --> 01:21:12,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Mori in our chatroom says, fucking epic is now my new phrase of the week.

1487
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:14,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everybody, that's today's secret word.

1488
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:19,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time you hear the secret word, scream it out loud.

1489
01:21:20,492 --> 01:21:23,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so that's all you've been playing is Final Fantasy XII non-stop?

1490
01:21:24,555 --> 01:21:24,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

1491
01:21:25,035 --> 01:21:27,197
[SPEAKER_07]: How was the cosplay over there when the game came out?

1492
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:30,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you go to one of those midnight parties with the cosplay and all that stuff?

1493
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:35,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to my local Azdra at midnight and there was like two people queuing up for it and that was it.

1494
01:21:36,463 --> 01:21:37,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I was quite shocked.

1495
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:38,239
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1496
01:21:59,643 --> 01:22:02,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Supernova?

1497
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:08,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancing Stage Supernova, because heaven forbid I say revolution in a British territory.

1498
01:22:09,308 --> 01:22:11,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's... I don't know.

1499
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:14,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, why else don't they call it Dance Dance Revolution over there?

1500
01:22:15,412 --> 01:22:15,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1501
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:17,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

1502
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:20,915
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a completely different song list, right?

1503
01:22:23,016 --> 01:22:24,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they call it Dance Dance Revolution on PlayStation 1?

1504
01:22:25,518 --> 01:22:27,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got first mix.

1505
01:22:27,919 --> 01:22:29,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, don't you get it in two weeks?

1506
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,100
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really close to coming out, isn't it?

1507
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:35,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, but I don't know if that's a real release date.

1508
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:42,665
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting DDR Universe next week, and I'm pretty excited about that.

1509
01:22:43,145 --> 01:22:44,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm very excited about DDR Universe.

1510
01:22:45,686 --> 01:22:49,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancing Stage Universe should be making its way over there soon enough, I imagine.

1511
01:22:50,147 --> 01:22:53,869
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Stacia, we've got to end our Part A here and get into Part B, but thanks so much for your call.

1512
01:22:53,889 --> 01:22:54,249
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, buddy?

1513
01:22:55,089 --> 01:22:55,389
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1514
01:22:56,069 --> 01:22:56,589
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next week.

1515
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:57,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, my friends.

1516
01:22:57,289 --> 01:22:58,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, sexy face.

1517
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:02,630
[SPEAKER_07]: You make your flirting so obvious, Rice Princess.

1518
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you add Rice Princess on MySpace yet?

1519
01:23:04,911 --> 01:23:05,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

1520
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:08,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys corresponding at all?

1521
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:08,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1522
01:23:08,671 --> 01:23:09,551
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in your business.

1523
01:23:09,872 --> 01:23:10,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1524
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:10,652
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1525
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:11,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll back up.

1526
01:23:11,672 --> 01:23:13,252
[SPEAKER_07]: More to come next week's episode.

1527
01:23:13,592 --> 01:23:13,892
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1528
01:23:14,132 --> 01:23:14,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, Sesha.

1529
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:15,833
[SPEAKER_04]: See you.

1530
01:23:15,853 --> 01:23:16,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1531
01:23:16,433 --> 01:23:16,673
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1532
01:23:16,953 --> 01:23:18,633
[SPEAKER_07]: If you didn't get through right now, don't worry.

1533
01:23:18,653 --> 01:23:24,234
[SPEAKER_07]: The phone lines will be open again in Part B, so please don't get your panties in a bunch that you did not make it onto the show.

1534
01:23:24,819 --> 01:23:27,681
[SPEAKER_07]: because the phone lines will be open again in Part B. We just had a little extra time.

1535
01:23:28,362 --> 01:23:30,643
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make this part an hour and a half, so there you have it.

1536
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:31,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Some phone calls.

1537
01:23:31,804 --> 01:23:37,768
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to be back with Part B. DarkSakura is going to be here in pre-taped form.

1538
01:23:38,148 --> 01:23:41,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Beat the Host, one of our favorite OLR games.

1539
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:43,352
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be beating Rob in the ass.

1540
01:23:43,412 --> 01:23:46,154
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I'm glad LankyStyle is here because he'd probably be better at it.

1541
01:23:46,194 --> 01:23:46,994
[SPEAKER_07]: He would be good.

1542
01:23:47,034 --> 01:23:48,975
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you feel about classic arcade games?

1543
01:23:49,015 --> 01:23:49,976
[SPEAKER_07]: That's this week's topic.

1544
01:23:50,597 --> 01:23:51,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel good.

1545
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:54,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I think, honestly, if you guys want a challenge tonight, Lanky Styles works out.

1546
01:23:54,532 --> 01:23:55,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew that he would.

1547
01:23:55,213 --> 01:24:01,497
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to make fun of one of the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, Rice Princess would be a good one to pick on, because she'll bomb it.

1548
01:24:01,798 --> 01:24:02,318
[SPEAKER_07]: She'll get one.

1549
01:24:02,658 --> 01:24:03,619
[SPEAKER_08]: She eats rice.

1550
01:24:03,879 --> 01:24:09,183
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and I will tell you how you can be the listener that battles them very soon, a little bit later on.

1551
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,424
[SPEAKER_07]: But for now, we're going to take a break.

1552
01:24:10,464 --> 01:24:12,766
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B.

1553
01:24:13,906 --> 01:24:23,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
