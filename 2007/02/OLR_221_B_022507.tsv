0	25440	And we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 221 for this February the 25th
25440	28720	of 2007 and we are here with part B of our podcast.
28720	32160	If it's your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you should dip back into our
32160	33160	archives.
33160	34160	Visit www.orangeloungeradio.com.
34160	39100	You can hear the first half of the show where we talked about the virtual console and how
39100	43000	Perrin Kaplan is always the introduction to the opposite sketch and much more.
43000	45400	We even took some calls, which is a rarity for part A.
45400	47920	So now we're going to get into part B, some more news.
47920	51080	Dark Soccer is not here this week, but she'll be joining us for a tape segment in part B
51080	55360	to do the mailbag because we always welcome your emails at mailbag.orangeloungeradio.com.
55360	56680	It is an interactive show.
56680	57680	It's not just about us.
57680	60280	I mean, we're just some schmoes on the internet like you.
60280	62380	We want to always welcome you guys to interact with the program.
62380	65800	We also have our chat room, hi chat room, waiting to interact with us.
65800	68360	Also in part B tonight, Beat the Host.
68360	70920	So Loki's looking forward to getting beat up a little bit.
70920	71920	A little later on in the show.
71920	72920	If they choose me.
72920	73920	If they choose you.
73920	74920	All right.
74920	81400	Anyways, so apparently the rumor that Warhawk was going to be a download title is going
81400	82760	to be true, I guess.
82760	91720	According to 1UP's Sam Kennedy, he apparently just recently was shown by Incognito, the
91720	95560	brand new Warhawk game, and it is going to be a download title.
95560	100800	And a quote from him, what Warhawk is apparently evolved into is a multiplayer only title featuring
100800	104920	ground and air combat that will be downloadable from the PlayStation Network.
104920	108340	That's definitely not the Warhawk experience I'd imagined when I first saw the trailer
108340	112720	two years ago, but that's not to say that I've lost excitement over it either.
112720	115760	But for all I know, it could still be pretty freaking cool.
115760	121640	It's just not what I expected.
121640	124640	It's very interesting to see one of these titles that was supposed to be one of the
124640	132680	flagship titles for Sony is now a kind of a tech demo that they're releasing now as
132680	136880	a multiplayer game on the PlayStation Network.
136880	140440	Is it really this title is that weak that it can't be released retail?
140440	145240	Or is it just that the PlayStation Network doesn't have anything on it, or a combination
145240	146520	of the two?
146520	148520	Blaze doubts the truth behind this.
148520	152120	Blaze in Chatham says 1UP is a tool of Satan, therefore they lie.
152120	156440	Very true, but I would take it if they're going and actually visiting the studio that
156440	158720	maybe this is the case.
158720	163440	But then again, they haven't officially announced it yet, so I guess we can still call it rumor.
163440	164440	Would you buy this?
164440	165440	Nope.
165440	166440	Downloadable?
166440	167440	At all.
167440	168440	You know what though?
168440	169440	I go, how much is it possibly going to be downloadable?
169440	172320	It would have been 25 bucks, and then it would have been 60 bucks as a retail title.
172320	175800	I'll have to see what the price is going to be on this, because I know one of the things
175800	178480	that they're pushing is full downloadable games.
178480	184080	So if they're just going to test the waters with Warhawk, it better be good.
184080	188560	I'll wait and hear the reviews on it, and that will determine whether I purchase it
188560	189560	or not.
189560	190560	Because it's just like Qbert.
190560	193640	Qbert's a downloadable title, and just because it's downloadable doesn't mean I'm going to
193640	194640	buy it.
194640	198040	It's crap, so I'll wait.
198040	201160	Misty in our chat room says, aren't most game sites tools of Satan?
201160	202160	Yeah, that's true.
202160	205680	And actually, that gives me a chance to work in a plug for AllGames.com, where our show
205680	211520	is rebroadcast every week, Monday nights at 5.30, unless they run long, which they usually
211520	215600	do, and Pacific time, and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
215600	218900	AllGames.com actually endorsed by Satan himself, actually.
218900	219900	So check it out.
219900	220900	Hot.
220900	221900	Hot, yeah, that's hot.
221900	222900	Really.
222900	223900	Literally.
223900	224900	Whoa, yeah.
224900	225900	All right.
225900	226900	Do you care about Warhawk at All Rights Princess?
226900	229100	I don't even know what the hell that is.
229100	230800	They had it on PlayStation 1.
230800	233480	It's like a biplane, like old shooting type game.
233480	235480	I mean, you're into bi.
235480	241940	It was done by the same people that did Twisted Metal, and it was one of those kind of air
241940	243400	combat games.
243400	248920	But it was one of the big things that they were showing off the six axis controller at
248920	254760	E3, and I remember laughing my ass off when I saw the guy demoing it, and he barely landed
254760	258960	this thing on the little landing pad, because the thing was like practically falling off
258960	263320	of the landing pad, because he just sucked balls at actually using this.
263320	264320	So that was kind of funny.
264320	267320	I would have loved to see him like land it and the whole thing tip over and fall into
267320	271480	the water, but alas, we can't always get what we want.
271480	272480	All right.
272480	274820	Well, some other PlayStation 3 news for you guys.
274820	279000	If you guys have been kind of QQing over the fact that there's not a lot of, and I don't
279000	284500	mean lining up, a lot of PlayStation 3 exclusives coming out, what's interesting is that they
284500	289760	are going to be getting some exclusives for Spider-Man 3, which I believe is a Sony picture
289760	290760	movie.
290760	291760	Of course.
291760	292760	I'm not mistaken.
292760	296600	What's interesting about it is that Activision will be putting out a PlayStation 3 exclusive
296600	302080	version of Spider-Man 3, but it's just the collector's edition that's exclusive.
302080	306000	The game itself will still be out on other platforms, but with the collector's edition
306000	312400	exclusive to the PlayStation 3, you get some webisodes for the Spider-Man 3 movie, an exclusive
312400	318360	interview with the producer, behind the scenes talk with the dreamy Tobey Maguire and Topher
318360	326200	Grace and James Franco, but oddly enough, Kirsten Dunst is not listed here, so she must
326200	331400	have been a bitch and not done it, especially Spider-Man 3 trailers as well.
331400	335800	As well as you get to play as the second Green Goblin in the game, there's going to be submissions.
335800	337680	Thank you for ruining the next part of the story.
337680	338680	Well, I thought you were done.
338680	339680	No, I was not done.
339680	340680	You paused.
340680	341680	You were a long pauser.
341680	345960	But I will say this, it also interfaces with the 6-axis controller.
345960	350000	What, you don't care about Spider-Man 3, Eddie?
350000	354880	No, but does the PlayStation 3 version exclusively suck?
354880	355880	I don't know.
355880	357280	It's a little early to judge.
357280	359600	It's going to be Spider-Man 3.
359600	361680	Most of the Spider-Man games actually have done pretty well.
361680	362680	Yeah, they're pretty good.
362680	365800	Except for me, the last one, the Ultimate Spider-Man is kind of lame, but there's no
365800	368720	movie coming out at the time.
368720	372880	Alpha Canagram says, duh, the Spider-Man font is on the PlayStation 3.
372880	378920	Well, that's just because they're just unoriginal, so they're going to use that.
378920	381000	We can't think of a font for the PlayStation 3.
381000	382480	Ah, fuck it, let's just steal it.
382480	384520	It's our property anyways.
384520	386520	So fuck them.
386520	395800	Anyways, speaking of fucking over things, PlayStation 3 is going to be $1,000 in Australia.
395800	398120	That's Australian dollars, of course.
398120	405200	But that still equals up to $788 U.S. or 599 Euros.
405200	408960	So yeah, that kind of sucks.
408960	411160	Holy crap, mate.
411160	418880	And apparently they say that it's the same price as the European PS3.
418880	424080	It's just because the current exchange rate and the small population size of Australia,
424080	425860	they're just going to get fucked over.
425860	428040	Put another PlayStation 3 on the barbie.
428040	430160	You hear those clicks?
430160	432880	Those are all of our Australian listeners unsubscribing right there.
432880	434320	You know what, though?
434320	438320	The thing is, it may be more expensive, but you know what?
438320	443200	They're going to be including Casino Royale with it, so I'm sure that will make up for
443200	447960	the extra hundreds of dollars that you're going to have to pay for it.
447960	450720	The other thing also, which is kind of good, there was a rumor going around that there
450720	456740	was only going to be 11,000 units in Australia, which at that price point, I wouldn't be surprised.
456740	461720	But apparently it is going to be more than that, so if you are waiting to get your hands
461720	466280	on a PlayStation 3, just do what most of us are doing, just wait.
466280	469720	Leave it to the chat room to be making the Australia comments.
469720	474400	Mel B says, PS3, Australian for ripped off.
474400	477360	Like the commercials for the beer, get it?
477360	482120	And then Rama says, crikes, Australia's taking one up the arse.
482120	487080	You have the worst Australian accent, period.
487080	492000	My Australia sounds like a Scottish guy and my British sounds like an Australian guy.
492000	493640	It all just kind of sounds the same.
493640	496480	It's like your t-shirt dude slash straight guy, whatever.
496480	498600	You just don't try very hard, do you, Rama?
498600	501120	Look, I'm not on this show because I'm funny, okay?
501120	502120	We know that.
502120	503120	I don't know why I'm on this program.
503120	504120	Yeah, we don't know either.
504120	505120	I really don't know.
505120	511640	Oh, I'm on this program to give release dates to you every week from Japan, where there's
511640	513120	being made fun of of the Australians.
513120	515360	Heck, why don't we just travel on over to Japan?
515360	519960	Let's make fun of them, too, and their release dates for the upcoming week.
519960	526080	Coming out, let's see, on March 1st for the PlayStation 3, Gundam Musou, God, is this
526080	527600	the Gundam game we got here?
527600	530000	No, Gundam Musou is even better.
530000	531000	Gundam Musou is...
531000	532020	That's Mobile Suit Gundam, isn't it?
532020	535440	It's Mobile Suit Gundam mixed with Dynasty Warriors.
535440	536920	And there's a moose in it, too.
536920	544280	Dynasty Gundam, where you're fighting hundreds and hundreds of AI retarded...
544280	545280	That's a pass.
545280	546280	Thank you.
546280	547280	Robots.
547280	548800	Let's see, what's coming out over on the Nintendo Wii?
548800	550920	We have Densha de Go!
550920	552800	Shinkansen EX.
552800	555400	That's why you're on the show, Rob, to pronounce Japanese wrong.
555400	556400	Thank you very much.
556400	557400	It's great.
557400	559840	This is a game where it looks like you simulate a train.
559840	560840	It's a train sim.
560840	561840	Yay.
561840	562840	That should be fun.
562840	564520	It's like a train on the Nintendo Wii.
564520	566280	That'll be fun.
566280	567800	Coming out on the PlayStation 2.
567800	568800	You ready?
568800	569800	Sure.
569800	570800	Interlude.
570800	573280	But that's moving into the best version, so that doesn't really count.
573280	577280	Aku Daikan 3 is coming out.
577280	578280	Sumimasen.
578280	581680	I like this, because this is the best cover I think I've ever seen.
581680	586880	Is that you have these real people, and there's this guy on the cover that's making this face
586880	587880	like, huh?
587880	588880	What do you want?
588880	589880	He's like, I farted.
589880	590880	You looking at me, bitch?
590880	593780	I don't know what the hell type of game this is.
593780	594780	It's a strategy game.
594780	596800	I'm going to post the link there and chat room for those that want to see the cover
596800	597800	of that game.
597800	602520	That's one of my favorite covers I've seen in a long time.
602520	603640	Let's see.
603640	606240	What else do we have coming out over in Japan?
606240	613720	On the Nintendo DS, a handful of games coming out, Super Robot Taisen W is coming out.
613720	614720	Let's see.
614720	617020	Oh, Disney Meteos is almost out.
617020	618020	That's March.
618020	619020	Disney Meteos?
619020	620020	Oh, that's the US.
620020	621020	Like Meteos?
621020	622020	Never mind.
622020	623020	That's March 5th in the US.
623020	624020	Sorry.
624020	625020	I'm not going to release any other release dates.
625020	626020	That's all I got.
626020	627020	Not a big week for releases in Japan.
627020	628020	Darn.
628020	631480	I'm also doing Euro release dates tonight, though, because Dark Soccer is not here, so
631480	640200	let me quickly get them out getting out some release dates.
640200	641520	Let's see.
641520	645920	The Elder Scrolls on the PSP is slated for March 1st.
645920	648280	Also slated for March 1st, Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass.
648280	649280	That doesn't sound right.
649280	651480	I thought that game got hella delayed.
651480	653280	You got hella delayed.
653280	654800	That's interesting.
654800	655800	What the hell?
655800	657040	These don't even sound like legitimate release dates.
657040	659400	They're talking about Resident Evil 5 on the Xbox 360?
659400	660400	What?
660400	661400	No.
661400	662400	No.
662400	663400	I think there's just some placeholders on this calendar here.
663400	664400	Wrong.
664400	665400	I would believe this, though.
665400	666400	Yu-Gi-Oh!
666400	668200	GX coming out on the 2nd for the PSP.
668200	669200	That certainly seems legit.
669200	670400	Still no one cares.
670400	673440	Sonic and the Secret Rings for the Wii also on the 2nd.
673440	674440	There you have it.
674440	675440	Uh-huh.
675440	676440	Awesome.
676440	677440	Wait.
677440	680360	Speaking of Resident Evil, is that on your agenda tonight?
680360	681360	I don't think so.
681360	683720	The Resident Evil 3 trailer came out for the movie?
683720	686320	No, it definitely was not on the agenda tonight.
686320	687320	Oh.
687320	688320	Well, the trailer's out.
688320	689320	And?
689320	690320	So go watch it.
690320	691320	It's called Resident Evil Extinction.
691320	693400	It actually doesn't show a lot.
693400	694400	It just kind of...
694400	698660	You know how on one of the first two movies, they show the fake umbrella commercial where
698660	704600	it's the face stuff or whatever, and if you've seen the cosmetic thing, whatever, it was
704600	705600	kind of like that.
705600	708080	They're like, we just don't even want to try anymore.
708080	709080	Yeah, kind of.
709080	711040	But I'm still going to see it because I like Resident Evil.
711040	715880	Rob D.'s making fun of me in chat saying, March 2007, Duke Nukem Forever coming to the
715880	716880	Wii.
716880	717880	Screw you.
717880	721880	ActDeaf says, Resident Evil 3 was filmed in my city.
721880	725920	So you live in Raccoon City?
725920	728440	Are there a lot of raccoons?
728440	730480	Okay, yeah, so that's it.
730480	732600	That's all I wanted to say.
732600	735760	Let's get some definite for sure release dates, Loki.
735760	736760	Wait.
736760	738280	Well, nothing's ever definite for sure.
738280	739680	I shouldn't try and fill in for Jamie.
739680	741240	I just shouldn't.
741240	745160	Let's see, some exclusive stuff real quick, and this isn't all that great.
745160	748360	It's already been announced, Command & Conquer 3 for the 360.
748360	752120	It is coming out now, though, May 9th, so that's kind of cool.
752120	754480	Definitely needs some more real-time strategy stuff.
754480	757320	This one's kind of interesting, but not too exciting.
757320	761400	Backyard Football 08, and this is one of those franchises.
761400	767620	It's the only kid franchise for sports games, and it is coming to the Wii and PlayStation
767620	774280	2, but that's all the way in September 27th.
774280	777520	Definitely a budget Atari title that they keep putting out each year.
777520	780120	Arioma says Backyard Football is the best ever.
780120	781920	Okay, well, there you go.
781920	782920	The best ever.
782920	784680	I'll stick with that.
784680	788120	Anyways, this week, though, we've got some good stuff coming out.
788120	793520	On the 360, we have Bullet Witch, which is going to be pretty awesome, and if you're
793520	797080	definitely looking for some scantily clad witches fighting demons.
797080	798680	Oh, that's perfect.
798680	802520	And I do believe that there is a download where you can get a schoolgirl outfit for
802520	804840	her, so that's awesome.
804840	809520	Also on the 360, Dance Dance Revolution Universe, finally making its way out, and I'm picking
809520	810520	this up.
810520	811520	I can't wait to try it out.
811520	816120	Of course, I'm not going to be able to use a dance pad, but, you know, upstairs apartment
816120	818320	and all.
818320	819800	Samurai Warriors 2 Empires.
819800	821760	Okay, shit, I'm buying it anyway.
821760	822760	Listeners can deal.
822760	825680	If I have to hear them practicing guitar or piano or whatever they have down there, they're
825680	827560	going to hear me playing DDR.
827560	828560	Like it!
828560	833680	Samurai Warriors 2 Empires, coming out on the 360 and Playstation 2.
833680	837480	If you're even remotely interested in this, it's basically the same damn game that came
837480	839360	out in September.
839360	845960	On the Playstation 2 as well, MLB 2K7, that is also coming out on the Xbox, the 360, Playstation
845960	851440	3, and I believe the PSP, so if you need some baseball, you can get there.
851440	856560	Otherwise MLB 07, the show, is also coming out on Playstation 2.
856560	861400	On the Wii, we've got SSX Blur, which, you know, SSX is an awesome snowboarding game,
861400	863360	so definitely check that out.
863360	867780	Playstation 3, you've got Formula 1 Championship Edition, if you're a racing fan, you might
867780	868780	like that.
868780	875480	On the PSP, Chilli Con Carnage, which is, I believe, Total Overdose on the PSP now,
875480	882640	and 300 March to Glory, a PSP game based on the upcoming Frank Miller movie and comic.
882640	889800	Finally, also on the PC, we've got Jade Empire Special Edition, which looks pretty cool.
889800	899040	Also Sims 2 Seasons, you know, expansion pack for Sims 2, and I do believe that is it.
899040	905640	Oh, I think Luminous Plus might be coming, no I think it already came out, I can't remember.
905640	907160	That's moved around so many times.
907160	910000	I think it did, because DMM mentioned it when he called in earlier.
910000	914160	Yeah, but I think Source got it early, so they might have broken street on it.
914160	917640	I'm almost positive I saw it at a game stop like two months ago, but as much as I love
917640	919180	Luminous, I'm not buying it again.
919180	924720	I have it on PSP twice, I have it on 360, I don't need it again.
924720	925720	Really I don't.
925720	926720	It's a good game.
926720	928960	It's good, but it's not, you know, freaking buy it four times good.
928960	932560	And of course, you know, on Virtual Console, though, you've got, what is it, Ocarina of
932560	939880	Time coming out, so if you want to purchase a game virtually, you can go ahead and do
939880	940880	that.
940880	944880	Yeah, because I don't already have the GameCube disc and the version.
944880	947400	How many times have they released that game?
947400	948400	Too many.
948400	949400	Yeah.
949400	950400	All right.
950400	956320	Anyhow, speaking of buying things, one of the places very popular for folks to buy games
956320	957320	at is Circuit City.
957320	962280	Well, what's interesting about this is that Circuit City is testing a new program online
962280	964440	and at select stores.
964440	969000	They are now dabbling in used game sales, so it looks like they want to start competing
969000	971280	with places like GameStop.
971280	974240	Of course, this means, you know, games are usually selling about five dollars cheaper
974240	975640	than they usually do.
975640	979160	The prices, it appears, according to reports, are about the same that you would see at a
979160	980960	GameStop.
980960	984400	But of course, Circuit City wants a piece of that billion dollar market, apparently,
984400	986160	that GameStop EB Games has.
986160	990360	I think a little competition for GameStop would be a healthy thing, so I totally support
990360	991360	this.
991360	995080	Although, I have to admit, I don't usually shop at Circuit City, but maybe that's part
995080	996880	of another reason they want to do this.
996880	999760	Maybe they'd like to get their foot in the door a little more with games, so I welcome
999760	1001200	the price competition.
1001200	1006120	I don't think GameStop could buy Circuit City very easily like they did EB Games and whatever
1006120	1009360	else they've been buying lately, so I think this will be a good thing.
1009360	1014680	Yeah, it is a good thing as long as they don't kind of go along the same lines of their ads
1014680	1020880	and coupon policy, which means that, well, for example, there was a situation that happened
1020880	1021880	last month.
1021880	1026560	Circuit City had a flyer that ran an ad which promised to save you up to forty dollars when
1026560	1028840	you buy your Wii with them.
1028840	1032800	It says as long as you visited the website, printed the flyer, went to the shop, they
1032800	1034480	give you the discount.
1034480	1036480	Later on, though, they said they'd take it all back.
1036480	1040280	They said the discount actually comes with a statement qualifying purchases excluding
1040280	1044880	gaming hardware and took the coupon off the site completely.
1044880	1050800	But apparently people went to the store and wanted the discount and they couldn't get
1050800	1051800	it.
1051800	1055920	Then, of course, they complained to the Better Business Bureau and so on and so forth.
1055920	1064320	The response was apparently the Better Business Bureau received a ton of responses for it.
1064320	1072040	One of the things they basically got from Circuit City was that they reserve the right
1072040	1078680	to make changes to advertisements and coupons, et cetera, whenever they want.
1078680	1083800	Where they can print out, you can have a coupon for forty dollars off of a system or something.
1083800	1086600	They can go ahead and bait and switch.
1086600	1089080	Huge comments from Chat Room on these two topics.
1089080	1092360	Joshi16 says, Circuit City will give up, me thinks.
1092360	1094840	Shadow Charlie says, Circuit City, they can go fuck themselves.
1094840	1098320	DDR Dollar Bill says, Circuit City will fall soon.
1098320	1102280	Blaze says, Competition for GameStop is important because there is little competition out there.
1102280	1104560	James Patrick says, GameStop killed EB Games.
1104560	1106200	I hate them for that.
1106200	1109040	Hitstun says, I'm starting to really miss Funkoland.
1109040	1110680	That made a lot of people go, Funkoland!
1110680	1111680	Funkoland was awesome!
1111680	1114280	The way you say it's funny, like Funkoland.
1114280	1117160	Hey, it's exactly like it's so funky.
1117160	1119080	It's got a lot of funk to it.
1119080	1120080	Funkoland.
1120080	1121080	All right.
1121080	1122080	Yeah.
1122080	1127200	So we have some other stuff coming up in this segment, including Beat the Host.
1127200	1130660	And of course, we need to find a worthy competitor to play Beat the Host tonight.
1130660	1136460	So if you want to guess some arcade retro classics here with us, we're going to be asking
1136460	1139040	a question here very soon.
1139040	1142440	But we have a couple more stories for you first.
1142440	1145360	And that is this one, which I think is very interesting.
1145360	1148120	Apparently, Dig is trying to trademark its name.
1148120	1149120	You know Dig.com?
1149120	1150120	D-I-G-G.com.
1150120	1152080	They're trying to trademark their name.
1152080	1154080	And let me work in a cheap plug.
1154080	1157140	If you would, Orange Lounge Radio is on Dig.
1157140	1161920	And we used to be on the first page, but WC Radio really kicked our butt.
1161920	1162920	Thanks.
1162920	1163920	Thanks for that, Speedy.
1163920	1164920	No, just kidding.
1164920	1168800	But a lot of shows are kicking our butt there on Dig, including the Corpcast.
1168800	1170260	So we need help.
1170260	1173240	So if you would like to Dig our show, head on over to Dig.com, click on Podcast, search
1173240	1174240	Orange Lounge.
1174240	1175240	You'll find us.
1175240	1176240	Give us a Dig.
1176240	1177240	I'm sure somebody will post a link in chat.
1177240	1178740	We could also use reviews on iTunes.
1178740	1179740	And I'll tell you what.
1179740	1183280	We actually had two people post reviews last week, so the OLR is the festering rash of
1183280	1184280	internet radio.
1184280	1185280	Awesome.
1185280	1186280	Awesome work.
1186280	1187640	And then UNI made a more serious review.
1187640	1188640	Awesome work, people.
1188640	1189960	I'm so proud of the OLR me.
1189960	1192280	So we definitely need more Digs and more reviews.
1192280	1194840	Anyhow, so you know Dig, the social networking site.
1194840	1200640	Well get this, apparently LucasArts is trying to interfere with this trademark.
1200640	1208000	They have actually put in an injunction or whatever, filed an opposition, shall we say,
1208000	1212120	because they had a game in 1995 called The Dig.
1212120	1217560	And because Dig has a gaming page and you have this game called The Dig, LucasArts says
1217560	1218560	it's too confusing.
1218560	1219560	But what?
1219560	1221960	It's not even spelled the same way or anything.
1221960	1225000	Like that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
1225000	1226000	That is terrible.
1226000	1227000	It's pretty bad.
1227000	1228000	Apparently it is spelled the same way.
1228000	1229000	Is it The Dig?
1229000	1230000	No.
1230000	1232000	Because this is D-A-G-G and The Dig is just like a Dig.
1232000	1233000	No, the game was The Dig.
1233000	1234720	Well I forgot that The Dig even existed.
1234720	1236180	Me too.
1236180	1238880	How could you forget it was such a good game?
1238880	1240580	I don't know.
1240580	1242080	That's stupid.
1242080	1243080	Stupid LucasArts.
1243080	1252600	It's all George Lucas' fault because he makes crappy fixes to his Star Wars movies.
1252600	1256720	So speaking of putting the blame on others.
1256720	1259360	Wait, I have to say this.
1259360	1263320	Speedy in chat says Dig Dug should sue.
1263320	1264320	That's true.
1264320	1266600	If The Dig can sue, why can't Dig Dug?
1266600	1269440	Why doesn't Dig Dug sue The Dig?
1269440	1271400	When you dig stories, don't you say Dug It?
1271400	1272600	Like it says, hey, you dug it.
1272600	1273600	Hey man, I dug it.
1273600	1274600	Yay.
1274600	1275600	You know what?
1275600	1276600	Namco, get on that.
1276600	1284760	I think like grave robbers and those guys should sue people too.
1284760	1286840	That's it.
1286840	1287840	Sorry.
1287840	1288840	That was stupid.
1288840	1289840	No, I'm really sorry.
1289840	1290840	I interrupted Loki.
1290840	1291840	I know.
1291840	1301760	They were at a Seattle, Washington news station and unfortunately, they're retarded but KOMO
1301760	1310880	TV, they reported on the sexual predators that are on Xbox Live and they're blaming
1310880	1315160	Xbox Live for apparently people.
1315160	1320600	Remember this whole story with the kid getting kidnapped and they apparently had some pictures
1320600	1322160	on live or something like that?
1322160	1327280	Anyways, they're documenting this 13-year-old boy playing Gears of War which that right
1327280	1329400	there is a mature rated game.
1329400	1333320	Parents obviously not paying attention to what this kid is doing.
1333320	1338200	Thank you by the way, case in point, I think this makes the whole story a piece of shit
1338200	1342040	right there that they taped a 13-year-old playing Gears of War when it says clearly
1342040	1345000	right there on the label, it's a mature game.
1345000	1350060	Anyways though, it says a parent is helpless to do anything and a grown man playing the
1350060	1357600	Lolita character for game points and that basically went on to talk a little bit about
1357600	1358600	it.
1358600	1363200	It's all sensationalism basically but they were also talking about how there's no way
1363200	1370160	that the parents have to be online or with their kids I guess or something in order for
1370160	1374280	the parental blocking to work or something.
1374280	1379220	Either way, it was one of those stories done by a local station for ratings that obviously
1379220	1384400	had no facts whatsoever regarding the subject and of course everybody jumps on it like you
1384400	1385400	know crazy.
1385400	1390760	Hey baby, why don't you come over here and I'll show you the size of my Xbox Live points
1390760	1391760	card.
1391760	1393640	Oh yeah.
1393640	1394920	That was terrible, Rom.
1394920	1397280	And so is the story.
1397280	1398280	I know.
1398280	1399280	Whoa, don't yell at me.
1399280	1400760	Oh, I concur with you.
1400760	1402560	This has to be, I have to laugh at this.
1402560	1410360	This is also, they have a picture from Fancy Star Universe which it says right here, 500
1410360	1415080	for pics, 1,000 for nude cam show.
1415080	1416560	Oh my God.
1416560	1420360	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, want to see my gamer score?
1420360	1421880	Oh gosh.
1421880	1426680	It says people are from Ohio, Kansas and I'm from Washington.
1426680	1429560	You can just talk to each other really clear.
1429560	1434280	I've met other people as far away as Russia and then it says the parents are talking about
1434280	1435280	it.
1435280	1436280	We're really concerned.
1436280	1439000	Our problem is parents don't see this as a threat yet.
1439000	1442440	Of course they're not paying attention to what their kid's doing.
1442440	1448240	Anyways, you've got to check out the article, it's hilarious, comotv.com slash news slash
1448240	1454400	5983826.html or just probably just search on the website and you'll find online gaming
1454400	1456520	world as a forum for sex predators.
1456520	1459920	That's the story article but it's funny.
1459920	1460920	Hey Rob.
1460920	1461920	What?
1461920	1466560	You want to come over and see my huge stiff boner?
1466560	1472520	Actually, coming from a woman, I kind of would like to see how you're going to pull that
1472520	1473520	off.
1473520	1479520	Okay, 500 for pics, 1,000 for live webcam action, whatever the fuck it's in.
1479520	1481880	Okay, here's another one right here.
1481880	1484920	They're talking about apparently this kid Adam.
1484920	1491320	I think this is a 13 year old they're talking about, his mother Karen Epstein.
1491320	1496840	She does not know about the feature, the blocking features on Xbox Live.
1496840	1502320	When she opened Adam's online account, she handed him over the setup so that he can do
1502320	1505400	all the setup stuff for the account.
1505400	1511720	Okay, well apparently this parent is just stupid because she's handing over this stuff
1511720	1517400	to her kid and letting him get in basically all this trouble and stuff and to be honest,
1517400	1521400	if you're really that concerned about your kid, and to be honest, I don't think she even
1521400	1524880	knows that there's a threat out there with this stuff until the news person says, did
1524880	1527600	you know your kid can get raped from Xbox Live?
1527600	1531960	Then she's like, whoa, what the fuck?
1531960	1536240	In related news, according to that one news story we talked about a couple months ago,
1536240	1538600	PictoChat is raping children everywhere.
1538600	1540600	Did you hear about this?
1540600	1545760	I'm going to start using PictoChat now.
1545760	1547560	Rice Princess is horny.
1547560	1548560	Whatever.
1548560	1550960	You can't rape the willing Rice Princess.
1550960	1551960	This is true.
1551960	1552960	All right.
1552960	1553960	Hey little boys.
1553960	1554960	No, I'm just kidding.
1554960	1555960	All right.
1555960	1556960	Oh God.
1556960	1557960	Wash my brain.
1557960	1558960	Never be clean.
1558960	1559960	Never be clean.
1559960	1560960	All right.
1560960	1561960	Anyhow.
1561960	1562960	I don't feel yourself.
1562960	1563960	Here it is kids, tonight's question.
1563960	1566960	The first one to send this in a private message to me in the chat room gets to play beat the
1566960	1571120	host tonight and you have to be willing to use Skype or call our 800 number to be a part
1571120	1572120	of the game.
1572120	1576480	Now, tonight's topic is classic gaming, right?
1576480	1580520	The question is, if you're a classic gaming expert, this should be no problem for you.
1580520	1583600	On what board number does Pac-Man crash?
1583600	1585640	That is on what board number does Pac-Man crash?
1585640	1586640	There you go.
1586640	1590040	I posted it on the chat room, so if you know your classic games, you know what I'm talking
1590040	1591040	about.
1591040	1592040	There it is.
1592040	1593040	All right.
1593040	1598400	Now, controversial stories like our last one always generate a lot of emails and we always
1598400	1602760	get a lot of good emails to our mailbag at orangelanatradia.com and through the magic
1602760	1608440	of the space-time continuum, Dark Sacra is here tonight to read us our emails.
1608440	1611120	Hi Jamie.
1611120	1622040	Yo, this is the voice from beyond who isn't here because of family business.
1622040	1626760	Here is the mailbag and the first email comes from some guy...
1626760	1631000	Thank God I'm here too to interrupt you because it just wouldn't be a mailbag segment if I
1631000	1632560	couldn't talk too damn much.
1632560	1634880	Rob, I hate your Mac.
1634880	1637000	Hey, bring your own laptop next time.
1637000	1638000	B-Y-O-L 24 for you.
1638000	1641120	Hey, I was going to give you a free massage, so bite me.
1641120	1642120	Massage my butt.
1642120	1645160	No, I'm not into the glute massage, sorry.
1645160	1646840	Massage my middle finger right there.
1646840	1647840	I massaged Christopher's.
1647840	1648840	Did you?
1648840	1649840	Yes.
1649840	1650840	All right.
1650840	1651840	Good to hear.
1651840	1653840	This email comes from some dude named Mark.
1653840	1658080	God, why can't people just be patient?
1658080	1662320	Anyway, I'm sorry to say, but the standard of your show the last couple episodes has
1662320	1664240	seriously gone downhill.
1664240	1667280	It's becoming less of a show about video games and more about your social lives.
1667280	1669600	There seems to be a lot of hideous screaming and yelling.
1669600	1671160	It's really crossed the line of unprofessional.
1671160	1672360	Hey, Jamie.
1672360	1674360	I got to fart.
1674360	1680800	I think if Sky kept on topic and I know he tries, the show would go for half the time.
1680800	1683520	That's kind of funny because usually people are like, do more.
1683520	1684520	Okay.
1684520	1685880	Well, it's been a polarizing thing.
1685880	1688760	Some people with the last couple episodes have been like, oh my God, this has been like
1688760	1691480	the funniest things you guys have ever taped, and some people-
1691480	1692480	Let me finish the email.
1692480	1693480	All right, fine.
1693480	1698160	I also listen to the video game show and gamer cast network, which both have the right balance
1698160	1699800	of humor and information.
1699800	1702760	It's a shame because I love hearing about Dark Sakura's obsession with collection.
1702760	1703760	You do.
1703760	1709800	In Loki's tech news, even when he gets so angry, he fumbles his words, LOL, but I don't
1709800	1712920	have the time and patience to sift through the nonsense to get the info I need.
1712920	1714920	He didn't say he unsubscribed.
1714920	1716400	I thought I said he unsubscribed.
1716400	1717400	No.
1717400	1718400	Whatever.
1718400	1720960	The patience isn't spelled like... You spelled patience like-
1720960	1724760	See, now you're just being a bitch to him because he had something negative to say about
1724760	1725760	the show.
1725760	1726760	No, no, no, no.
1726760	1729080	I'm just pointing out for future reference that the type of patience that you spelled
1729080	1730080	belong in a hospital.
1730080	1731080	Oh my God.
1731080	1732080	Okay.
1732080	1733080	So to get back-
1733080	1737480	You too can send us an email and get your spelling and grammar berated by Jamie live
1737480	1740320	on the air and you wonder why people unsubscribe from the show.
1740320	1741320	He didn't unsubscribe.
1741320	1742320	He didn't say he unsubscribed.
1742320	1743320	Sorry.
1743320	1744320	Well, he didn't say he stopped listening, though.
1744320	1745320	No.
1745320	1746320	He didn't say he stopped listening.
1746320	1747320	Well, hopefully-
1747320	1748320	This is a shame.
1748320	1749840	Well, he's going to really unsubscribe now.
1749840	1750840	No.
1750840	1753560	I'm saying that out of the kindness of my heart.
1753560	1754560	You know what?
1754560	1755560	Yeah.
1755560	1756560	We kind of agree.
1756560	1757560	Really?
1757560	1758560	Are you unsubscribing from the show too?
1758560	1759560	Fuck you.
1759560	1760560	No.
1760560	1761880	Is that why you're not here tonight?
1761880	1762880	No.
1762880	1765080	I'm going to my grandfather-in-law's birthday party.
1765080	1766080	Yeah.
1766080	1772200	I'm a firm believer in family values as in I believe in the value of... Never mind.
1772200	1773200	Sorry.
1773200	1774200	You're getting off topic.
1774200	1775200	We need to talk more about games.
1775200	1776640	Is this about a video game?
1776640	1777640	Is your grandpa a video game?
1777640	1778640	I don't think he is.
1778640	1779640	He's not my grandpa.
1779640	1780640	Well-
1780640	1781640	All right.
1781640	1782640	You say your piece also.
1782640	1783640	Okay.
1783640	1787400	Anyway, I think, yeah, to a degree, it's gotten a little bit crazy, but you know, those like
1787400	1791200	how the shows used to be back in the day and I think it's kind of fun to let loose and
1791200	1799800	be kind of silly once in a while because really ratings state other than what you just said.
1799800	1804480	However, you know, I like to keep it a bit more in line and finding the balance is kind
1804480	1808920	of hard, but sometimes you do have to let loose and be a little bit silly sometimes.
1808920	1812680	You know, everybody needs a change, a little break.
1812680	1814400	Change is good for you.
1814400	1819200	Maybe you know, maybe you need to be silly more often.
1819200	1823800	You're one of those people who seems to me that your energy is rooted in your root chakra,
1823800	1824800	which is the first one.
1824800	1825800	Oh, Jesus Christ.
1825800	1826800	All right.
1826800	1827800	Look, look.
1827800	1828800	I want to say my piece.
1828800	1829800	You know, I agree with what you're saying.
1829800	1833240	It's about balance and the trick is that we have to find the right balance on this program
1833240	1838480	between, you know, too crazy and too, you know, too much hardcore games because honestly,
1838480	1841140	you know, there's like 300 video game podcasts out there.
1841140	1845120	You know, granted, just because we were one of the first ones out there doesn't mean that,
1845120	1848840	you know, people will automatically, you know, tune into us because we were one of the first.
1848840	1852920	We have to compete with, you know, 300 podcasts, everything from other independent podcasts
1852920	1857280	to corporate podcasts, although I don't see the other independent podcasts really as competition.
1857280	1861280	So I actually want to say thank you to the emailer in a strange way because the other
1861280	1864960	podcast he says he's going to go listen to instead are at least both independent podcasts
1864960	1866840	that are, you know, just fine shows.
1866840	1868520	There wasn't an instead there.
1868520	1869880	Well, whatever.
1869880	1875280	Anyway, so regardless, you know, but it's interesting because for me, I know I've listened
1875280	1878440	to one of those shows before and they kind of have an off-topicness of their own.
1878440	1879440	That's not a bad thing.
1879440	1881820	I think you have to have a personal touch.
1881820	1883800	That's what makes all these shows unique.
1883800	1885720	So you know, we're still trying to find the balance in a way.
1885720	1888200	Yeah, I was a little crazy the past couple of weeks, but you know, it was fun.
1888200	1892800	I think what makes me happy about this one though is that he cared enough to tell us.
1892800	1893800	That's true.
1893800	1897680	And I mean, that to me just seems like is, you know, hey, I want you guys to do better,
1897680	1898680	you know.
1898680	1901640	So I mean, if that's the case, that's sort of the vibe I was getting.
1901640	1903160	So I hope that's the case.
1903160	1904160	Dude, I hope you're still listening.
1904160	1905680	I'm sorry for picking on you.
1905680	1912480	I pick on everybody out of love, but you know, honestly, that helps us do better.
1912480	1920880	So if you give us, if you stick with us, keep giving us that chance, you know, we'll cry.
1920880	1927320	I think you'll find again, the goal of the show is to be like friends sitting around
1927320	1931560	the dinner table talking smack about games and sometimes it's going to be on topic and
1931560	1935000	sometimes it's going to get a little crazy, but you know, keep in mind we do it for free.
1935000	1936840	Sometimes the craziness is what keeps us going.
1936840	1940240	I know I had a lot of fun the past two shows, so we'll see what happens.
1940240	1944880	I hear now I realize this portion is pre-taped, but I hear Rice Princess is going to be back
1944880	1945880	tonight.
1945880	1946880	So we're going to have to really rein her in.
1946880	1947880	Stay somewhat on topic.
1947880	1948880	Yeah, I'm not going to be here.
1948880	1949880	I'll be eating cake.
1949880	1950880	Well, have fun.
1950880	1953480	Bring me back some cake.
1953480	1954480	Is it ice cream cake?
1954480	1955480	I don't know.
1955480	1956480	It's for grandpa.
1956480	1957960	Cake the video game?
1957960	1958960	Cake the band?
1958960	1959960	So next email.
1959960	1960960	Yes.
1960960	1961960	Next email.
1961960	1962960	From AZHP.
1962960	1963960	Hey guys.
1963960	1964960	Hey.
1964960	1969320	I just wanted to comment on your story last week about PS3's price drop.
1969320	1973380	David Cracker actually came out and said that the Japanese financial division was talking
1973380	1975720	about price reduction, not price cut.
1975720	1976720	Okay.
1976720	1981900	He claimed in an interview with IGN or OneUp or someone that they were looking at ways
1981900	1987680	to make the PS3 cheaper to produce, but would not pass the savings on to the consumers.
1987680	1990060	Now do you guys think this is a wise decision?
1990060	1994040	Would they make more money by keeping the same price, but having a cheaper cost of production?
1994040	1997840	Would they benefit from having a larger install base with a price cut to get more software
1997840	1998840	sales?
1998840	2003880	It just feels like Sony of America doesn't even know what Sony Japan is doing or thinking.
2003880	2005240	They're all just winging it.
2005240	2009560	I love the PS2 even though I'm on my third one because they keep breaking, but they just
2009560	2013320	keep doing the wrong thing at the wrong time with the PS3 and PSP.
2013320	2015120	What's going on?
2015120	2021180	Oh, you know, I would rather pay more for a quality product.
2021180	2022360	That's my thought.
2022360	2027000	That's actually sort of why I like my first generation Japanese PS2 because even though
2027000	2031920	they had parts that were a little bit faster, they were a little bit better made in terms
2031920	2038560	of their sturdiness, so it's business.
2038560	2042400	They're always wanting to make things cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and not change the
2042400	2043400	price.
2043400	2045240	They want to make it transparent to the buyer.
2045240	2050080	You're not going to know the difference unless you take it apart and look at what they did
2050080	2051640	and compare it side by side.
2051640	2055240	Well, it's funny we talk about balance because I think that's what Sony is having to find
2055240	2059440	is a balance here between their cost and the cost to produce the system and how much they're
2059440	2060440	going to charge people.
2060440	2064040	That's a very fine line and obviously they took a big gamble when they charged a lot
2064040	2067800	for their system and some say that gamble may not be paying off.
2067800	2071520	Is it in their best interest to pass along this savings cost to the consumer?
2071520	2072520	I think so.
2072520	2076200	I think that if they are going to save money on the systems, they need to pass along that
2076200	2081200	savings to the consumer in some way, but in the end, keep in mind Sony is losing a lot
2081200	2083000	of money on the consoles still.
2083000	2088360	The average Blu-ray player is still $1,000 standalone, not in PS3.
2088360	2090920	You know they're taking a pretty big hit on these systems.
2090920	2095400	Granted, Sony doesn't want to keep taking such a big hit so they do want to cut corners,
2095400	2096400	but again, it's about a balance.
2096400	2101680	If they can maybe save $100 on a system, pass along $50 of that savings to me, at least
2101680	2105280	it will be the illusion of, hey, the price is falling even though they're going to actually
2105280	2108680	gain a little more money if that makes sense.
2108680	2116240	I hate to keep comparing things to my massage therapy, but actually a lot of what they talk
2116240	2120080	about in the business aspect of that is that when you're trying to get clients in, in this
2120080	2124000	case comparing it with new buyers, you make an introductory price.
2124000	2130760	You make a special, you know, get your PS3 at the sale date, maybe like a corporate sponsored
2130760	2135180	sale, they get a bajillion buyers, you know what I mean, they get more people purchasing
2135180	2139240	it and then have it be at the regular price, they can say, oh, well, this is a good product,
2139240	2142600	it's really worthwhile for you to buy it, and then other people will come back, and
2142600	2144480	that's, you know, I think how you do it.
2144480	2145480	All right.
2145480	2147480	I hope you're listening, Sony.
2147480	2149680	Sony never listens to us.
2149680	2151980	Kasarai just needs a massage.
2151980	2154120	He needs Jamie to touch his chakra.
2154120	2155120	Not by me.
2155120	2156880	I'm sorry, there's people I...
2156880	2158880	Give him a happy ending.
2158880	2161080	Rob Hart.
2161080	2164840	Okay, this one comes from Twist.
2164840	2167040	I think Twist is a new writer, too.
2167040	2168040	Hi, Twist.
2168040	2169040	Hi, Twist.
2169040	2170040	I think that you're awesome.
2170040	2171040	Anyway, hey, OLR.
2171040	2172840	A few things I want to write about today.
2172840	2177640	First off, I was at GameStop today, I'm so sorry, and there were two Sony men there.
2177640	2179600	Sony, big capital letters.
2179600	2182520	I guess they were just checking on their PS3 demo setup or something.
2182520	2186760	The assistant manager there, a friend of mine, was talking to one of them and asked when
2186760	2188840	the U.S. will see any white PSPs.
2188840	2191020	The man explained it probably wouldn't happen.
2191020	2195160	They watched Nintendo sell their multicolored systems and learned a little from it.
2195160	2198440	Owning every colored system seems to be a trend in Japan and not America.
2198440	2203180	Also, if a white PSP were to be released and someone who wanted a white PSP went to a store
2203180	2206720	to buy one and they only had black ones available, they would leave the store and not buy any
2206720	2207720	PSP.
2207720	2210840	They would therefore be losing out on a PSP sale.
2210840	2213760	Those were the excuses he gave.
2213760	2218080	Second thing I saw interesting was the sudden interest my girlfriend has in video games.
2218080	2222120	A few of my friends and I went to a local Super Smash Bros. tournament and my girlfriend
2222120	2223120	tagged along.
2223120	2226680	Afterwards, my friend apologized for exposing her to the nerds and the boringness and said
2226680	2230000	she had a blast just watching and couldn't wait to go to the next tourney.
2230000	2234240	She then grew a sudden interest in Smash Bros. and other fighting games I play.
2234240	2238160	We've been dating for only two months so I didn't think she liked video games much.
2238160	2240680	And instantly the sex stopped.
2240680	2244680	She later explained she used to hate video games.
2244680	2250380	She would get mad at her little brother all the time when they were younger and her father
2250380	2253260	would chase him off the TV when he would be playing.
2253260	2254440	So why the sudden interest I asked?
2254440	2259120	She figured out that she hated them maybe because her brother never let her play and
2259120	2260120	no one ever taught her.
2260120	2266720	So I thought maybe every girl is a potential gamer but can't express it because of game-hogging
2266720	2267720	brothers.
2267720	2270960	I don't know, I used to just kick my brothers off and play myself.
2270960	2273860	Last thing, Evolution Fighting Game Tournament, evo2k.com.
2273860	2274860	You guys should check it out.
2274860	2276180	It's a great experience.
2276180	2278960	People here take fighting games to a whole other level.
2278960	2280680	You guys have the Bimani community.
2280680	2283720	I have the fighting game community, lol.
2283720	2284720	That's all.
2284720	2285720	Love the show.
2285720	2286720	Keep it up.
2286720	2288420	No matter how off topic the show goes, it's always great.
2288420	2292560	You know, the fighting game community, they're some pretty hardcore people.
2292560	2297480	You know, I don't follow that scene a whole lot because I suck at fighting games but yeah,
2297480	2298480	it's pretty hardcore there.
2298480	2300500	I like Smash Bros. though but I suck at it.
2300500	2303800	There's just a funny story.
2303800	2309880	There's a guy who's well known in the cosplay community now named Chris, Chris Tang.
2309880	2314440	A long time ago when we first met him, he worked for Capcom and brought his own joystick
2314440	2320000	over to our house and proceeded to be on like a level 5 difficulty while Dan was at like
2320000	2325000	a 1 difficulty and Dan actually beat him around and he said that that was the most fun he's
2325000	2328900	ever had playing because someone actually managed to beat him.
2328900	2331800	So losing once in a while isn't so bad?
2331800	2335520	If you beat everybody that's around you, then...
2335520	2339360	That's why I kind of, you know, I love fighting games but there are people who get way too
2339360	2343080	into it who get too good for the game to be enjoyable I think.
2343080	2346600	Have I told my Street Fighter 2 chick story on this air once?
2346600	2350520	One time I was in L.A. and I was on like a trip and it was when I was younger, probably
2350520	2353640	about 17 and we were at a comic book shop late one night.
2353640	2356340	It was like after closing but for some reason a bunch of people were still there.
2356340	2360040	There are all these hardcore Street Fighter 2 people playing and I walked in, I didn't
2360040	2363360	know much about the game and I was playing Chun-Li and I kicked all their asses.
2363360	2364400	I did.
2364400	2367740	But the thing is that I probably beat like 8 of them in a row and they were getting pissed
2367740	2368740	like who is this guy?
2368740	2369740	What the hell is he doing?
2369740	2373840	You know it's probably because I was doing some new, I was some new blood and they all
2373840	2376800	knew each other's techniques probably so they kicked my ass.
2376800	2378900	Well finally, you know when I went down?
2378900	2383760	When some girl walked in and she also picked Chun-Li, she schooled me.
2383760	2388640	So if you ever have some chick that's trying to play that innocent thing like, oh what's
2388640	2390120	that controller?
2390120	2391120	Let me try.
2391120	2392360	I want to play this game.
2392360	2395240	You're in for an ass kicking because she's probably just doing that.
2395240	2397000	I loved doing that when I lived in Alabama.
2397000	2399000	Did I ever tell you the Tekken story?
2399000	2401240	I'm sure you have but if you want to say it again real quick.
2401240	2405280	Well there were these guys who had been in there all morning playing with King, nobody
2405280	2408640	but King, learning all the throws and everything, playing each other.
2408640	2415240	So I went in there and picked Julia who on Tekken, Julia and Jin both have moves that
2415240	2421300	block throws and so I was just using them over and over again and managed to piss them
2421300	2428880	off so badly that they left all of their credits in the machine and left and I of course took
2428880	2429880	advantage of it.
2429880	2433000	I'm not going to let any credits go to waste.
2433000	2434000	Very nice.
2434000	2435000	I love being a girl gamer.
2435000	2437200	I think we completely got off topic of that email but oh well.
2437200	2439000	That's what happens when you email us.
2439000	2441640	This one comes from Radink.
2441640	2442640	I guess it's also pronounced.
2442640	2443640	Hey, OLR.
2443640	2444640	Love the show.
2444640	2448000	I'm curious as to what the closing song of the show was.
2448000	2453880	Is I, Future List by Kiryamoka, fame producer of the Silent Hill series.
2453880	2455160	Uber email.
2455160	2458720	Okay, this is from McFloyd.
2458720	2459720	This is a great email.
2459720	2465720	Dear OLR crew, I haven't emailed in a while so I thought it was about time I did speaking
2465720	2468080	of emailing whatever happened to the letter of the week.
2468080	2471000	Did it just phase out because I haven't heard one being announced for a while?
2471000	2473880	The only reason I think about it is because my first email was the letter of the week
2473880	2477160	and I was ecstatic about it and I haven't heard much since then.
2477160	2478160	You know what?
2478160	2483160	It's been, okay, I know this is hardly an excuse but I have been horrendously busy.
2483160	2486320	Well, also just we haven't gotten a lot of Uber emails lately.
2486320	2487320	Yours is it.
2487320	2488320	Congratulations.
2488320	2489320	You're a second time winner.
2489320	2491240	Well, we don't get a lot of Uber emails.
2491240	2494280	I think the idea behind the letter of the week was for the Uber emails that were just
2494280	2498160	like too long to read on air, we would have them just be the letter of the week and everybody
2498160	2503160	could go read them on their own time but we haven't gotten a lot of those lately.
2503160	2504160	You know what?
2504160	2505160	This one's it.
2505160	2508920	It's the longest email we've received by default you in.
2508920	2510480	No, but actually it's a really good email.
2510480	2511640	I'm going to finish reading it.
2511640	2512640	Okay.
2512640	2515760	I'm finding more and more that graphics really do affect what I think of a system.
2515760	2519360	I love my Xbox 360 because it has games like Gears of War and I'm very excited about the
2519360	2522800	effects in Halo 3 from what I've been reading on the Bungie website.
2522800	2527320	Although I don't know if I'll be buying a PS3, it still really impresses me as everything
2527320	2528960	looks so realistic.
2528960	2532600	If Sony made some better decisions and the price went down a bit, I might even consider
2532600	2536520	getting the PS3 mainly because it has the processing power to make major games perform
2536520	2541240	well and possibly to make the dashboard or whatever it's called on the PS3 very sleek,
2541240	2547800	easy to navigate, and a simple place to put music, pictures, movies, et cetera.
2547800	2552760	In a few years, I would see the PS3 and Xbox 360 as good game consoles but I'm worried
2552760	2554080	about the Wii.
2554080	2558480	It doesn't have the power to play games that will make people gasp in admiration or the
2558480	2561240	space right off the bat to store large amounts of information.
2561240	2566080	It has the graphics of the game generation that was supposed to last five years and it's
2566080	2569120	supposed to last for a generation that could be even longer.
2569120	2573160	The controller is innovative, there's no doubt, but games like Katamari Damacy pulled
2573160	2578120	off innovation with regular PS2 controller and peripherals can always be made.
2578120	2583320	Software like the Wii channels could very easily be copied by Sony or Microsoft and
2583320	2584320	maybe even improved.
2584320	2585640	So why haven't they done it?
2585640	2586800	What are your opinions?
2586800	2590440	How do you think the Wii will last this generation?
2590440	2594240	I think, again, it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.
2594240	2599240	A system is only as good as the games that are on it and on the Wii, you have Wii Sports,
2599240	2604680	Zelda Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, and on the PlayStation 3, you have Mobile Suit
2604680	2607120	Gundam, Sonic the Hedgehog.
2607120	2614680	Granted, you have Resistance but Resistance is Resistance $600 plus $60.
2614680	2620720	Let me give the PS3 benefit of the doubt, $500 plus $60 plus whatever the component
2620720	2622200	cable costs to make the game look good.
2622200	2623200	Is it worth that?
2623200	2624520	Is it that good?
2624520	2626060	I say no.
2626060	2628320	For the average gamer, no.
2628320	2634720	Whereas the Wii, again, the Wii is going towards a different audience than you, the hardcore
2634720	2635720	gamer.
2635720	2638080	They're accomplishing their goal very beautifully, I think.
2638080	2640360	Honestly, I know a lot of people.
2640360	2642880	We had Marissa in here last week.
2642880	2646760	I've had other people I know that don't really play a lot of games or haven't played a lot
2646760	2647760	since Cape It Nintendo.
2647760	2650240	Grandparents are playing the Wii.
2650240	2655320	Even outside the grandparents, because I think a lot of the anti-Nintendo crowd says, oh,
2655320	2660080	well, a grandma may play Wii bowling, but does that mean she goes out and buys a Wii?
2660080	2663640	I don't know, but that means that grandma's going to think about that for her kids.
2663640	2671560	Actually, I was at Target a couple of days ago and saw this lady, probably in her early
2671560	2674720	60s, buying a Wii.
2674720	2675720	We were in line together.
2675720	2678560	I asked her, I was like, so this is for your grandkids?
2678560	2680800	She's like, no, it's for me.
2680800	2683280	You know, I don't want to come off sounding like a Nintendo fanboy.
2683280	2686400	To be fair, Sony has the potential.
2686400	2687400	You're right.
2687400	2688400	This guy's right.
2688400	2689820	The system's got a lot of processing power.
2689820	2693820	It's got a lot of potential, but at the same time, so does the Wii.
2693820	2696240	We know Nintendo always keeps secrets about systems.
2696240	2697960	They don't show off until later.
2697960	2701000	The Wii really, truly has not gone online yet.
2701000	2703440	I think they will, despite the whole friend code thing.
2703440	2707260	I just have this feeling that once you really sit down and play Animal Crossing with Wii
2707260	2711800	Connect 24, it's going to be a different type of experience all its own.
2711800	2716000	In the meantime, I still think Microsoft will always be the king of gaming, online gaming
2716000	2717000	in this case.
2717000	2718000	I don't know.
2718000	2719000	We'll see.
2719000	2720000	We'll see.
2720000	2721000	It's just too early.
2721000	2722900	I mean, wake me up when Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy 13 are out.
2722900	2728480	Then I can really assess the PlayStation 3, but right now, it's a pretty box with nothing
2728480	2731120	inside it.
2731120	2732120	That's how I feel.
2732120	2735480	Actually, mine's dusty now.
2735480	2736480	If I were to show-
2736480	2738240	It's a shiny, dusty collector.
2738240	2745160	If I were to show my mom resistance, she might go, well, it's nice looking, but if I were
2745160	2750080	to show my mom Wii Sports, she'd go, whoa, you're like up and you're moving.
2750080	2752120	It's just that you just swing it.
2752120	2753240	You don't have to hit a button.
2753240	2756040	That's all you do?
2756040	2759360	That's the difference between Nintendo and this generation and everything, despite what's
2759360	2760360	in the box.
2760360	2762740	Anyway, that's my ramblin' thought.
2762740	2764400	There's one other issue that's been bothering me.
2764400	2768960	The way people rate games, I find it disturbing, and this doesn't just relate to video games,
2768960	2775160	that sex is as much a bigger deal than violence for the ratings as it's a much worse thing.
2775160	2778740	For those who really understand what violence does, I suppose it's okay that violence is
2778740	2782420	so prominent in video games, but when little kids grow up seeing in movies and games that
2782420	2786640	violence is not such a big deal and sex is awkward or wrong, or when people do it they're
2786640	2790480	somehow breaking the rules, it definitely sets them on the wrong path for looking at
2790480	2791480	life.
2791480	2796140	I think that as long as games and shows are separated from reality, it's okay, but when
2796140	2799200	kids are becoming saturated with these ideas coming from them from all directions, it's
2799200	2803800	hard for parents to give them the right information when the media controls their kids' minds.
2803800	2807840	My point with all this is that you have to give the parents a break because entertainment,
2807840	2812160	video games included, is affecting children, and there will always be friends with systems
2812160	2815520	to play your TVs to watch, even parents try their hardest to stop it.
2815520	2818980	That would require an impossible amount of patience and strength to first extract what
2818980	2822920	a child has seen on TV and then put everything in context for them.
2822920	2826400	Parents don't often have the courage to teach children so much about life early on, so I
2826400	2830780	don't believe it's necessarily their fault if kids grow up desensitized and messed up.
2830780	2833040	The media has become crueler and more vicious.
2833040	2838360	Yeah, I can see it from that angle, I do understand that, but I think that it's just a matter
2838360	2845600	of actually, you know, you phrased it beautifully, parents don't often have the courage to teach
2845600	2848080	their children about life early on.
2848080	2855280	You know, I think that if they started off educating their children, you know, that would
2855280	2859720	avoid a lot of the problems, say, you know, make sure that if their child's going to see
2859720	2866160	something that they understand, and actually I have a very good relation to this, I was
2866160	2870640	actually just watching the second, an evening with Kevin Smith last night, he was talking
2870640	2871640	about his daughter.
2871640	2877360	He says he doesn't, they don't hide language around around their daughter, that they curse
2877360	2883720	all they want to, and, you know, and she basically has gotten to where she doesn't want to do
2883720	2887720	it just because she hears it, you know, it's not a big deal to her.
2887720	2891980	You know, it's just like, well, you know, when you're dieting, if you can have all the
2891980	2895360	chocolate cake you want, chocolate cake doesn't become special anymore, you won't want it
2895360	2896580	as much.
2896580	2904000	You know, I think that if you, not necessarily a blatant exposure of a violent element to
2904000	2908920	a child, but if you explain it how it is and say, you know, this is what goes on, this
2908920	2914720	is, you know, why people do this, this is what happens, if a child doesn't have to figure
2914720	2919600	it out for themselves, because their logic, they're not fully developed, their logic is
2919600	2920840	not all there.
2920840	2925680	If you say, hey, you know, this happens, this is what goes on, they're going to be in a
2925680	2929120	better position to assimilate what they're seeing.
2929120	2932000	It's very interesting you bring up that point, because I kind of, one other little thing,
2932000	2934720	I don't know if I was maybe mishearing or misreading into this letter, but I'm also
2934720	2941320	hearing that, you know, the society and the parents have a way bigger problem with sex
2941320	2945560	and games than they do with violence and games, and that's just American culture in general.
2945560	2950660	I mean, you're not just talking about video games there, it is movies, it is TV, sex is
2950660	2953880	always looked at way harsher than violence.
2953880	2958640	I mean, seriously, a movie says the F word twice and it gets rated R, but, you know,
2958640	2963720	you can blow up limbs and heads and, you know, sometimes you can still get away with a PG-13,
2963720	2967480	yet we have this real problem with underage sex in this country.
2967480	2968480	Interesting, hmm?
2968480	2973060	I don't know, you kind of apply what you're saying there and when it's taboo, people want
2973060	2974060	to do it.
2974060	2978680	I bet if mom and dad talked more about them having sex in front of the kids, the kids
2978680	2980760	would never want to have sex ever.
2980760	2981760	I'm joking.
2981760	2984280	I'm not a parent, I don't know.
2984280	2988680	Just something that I have more information that I've taken from my classes.
2988680	2996020	One of my teachers said that the reason why there's also a lot of unhealthiness in people
2996020	3000600	is because they have an unhealthy attitude toward their bodies.
3000600	3006860	You know, with us having this, you know, anorexic, waif-looking image on TV when all it is is
3006860	3012580	freakin' photoshopping and unhealthiness, when you're driven to be productive, when
3012580	3017920	all that's doing is raising your adrenaline, making your liver, you're dumping adrenaline
3017920	3020520	into your liver, which is shortening your lifespan in general.
3020520	3024820	You're not breathing properly, but also, you know, there's this whole attitude that sex
3024820	3027480	is something that you don't discuss.
3027480	3030880	It's something that you keep hidden, where it's offended.
3030880	3033560	I'm willing to discuss sex on this program any time.
3033560	3040680	Well, and you know, there's some people who don't need it so much.
3040680	3042920	You know, I'm not going to...
3042920	3046680	There's some people I know that do need it, because, you know, oh boy.
3046680	3053160	It really, but it is, I think, you know, it is, I think, an important part of your overall
3053160	3054160	well-being.
3054160	3058020	It's a balance that it creates, and when we treat it like it's a disease, when we treat
3058020	3065000	it like it's something that's disgusting, that's foul and immoral, you really take something
3065000	3069160	that's very healthy for you and treat it.
3069160	3077400	It's like having the cure for cancer and thinking that it's, and treating it illegal.
3077400	3079920	All the emails have this balance theme going on tonight.
3079920	3081000	I fully believe in balance.
3081000	3084960	I think it's a good thing, but you know, it's just that whole, that's, you know, I hate
3084960	3089800	to go off on the tangent like that, but that's my view toward how America views sex, because
3089800	3093820	if you go to a lot of other countries where people just can you go around topless or,
3093820	3099340	you know, where nudity is on TV and no one treats it like a big deal, look at their rate
3099340	3100760	of sex crimes, you know.
3100760	3102560	I'm going to start a trend right here.
3102560	3104520	I'm going to go around topless in studio right now.
3104520	3106520	You know what, Rob?
3106520	3113520	I can't, but it's, you know, if you take a look at it, we have such a high rate of sex
3113520	3121160	crime because I think it's because we do treat it like it's, like it's a disease.
3121160	3122720	Your thoughts are always welcomed out there.
3122720	3123720	Mail back to orangeslauncheted.com.
3123720	3128440	I'm sorry for going off on it, but you know, it's, it's, it's actually something that's
3128440	3132200	been sort of sitting on my head for a while because I really noticed it, you know, and
3132200	3133840	the video can be another symptom of it.
3133840	3137020	You know, the whole hot coffee thing is like, dude, why?
3137020	3140040	It's got an M rating anyway, didn't it?
3140040	3141040	I believe so.
3141040	3142040	Yeah.
3142040	3145440	I should have said it should have been AO, but that's R versus NC 17, but anyway, whatever.
3145440	3148280	So the last, the last phrase here, and by the way, Loki got pwned.
3148280	3152580	He was so confident about the Halo 3 release in spring, yet on the Bungie website, a picture
3152580	3157240	had the ad campaign came out and the bottom fall, 2007 was written boldly and clearly.
3157240	3159240	I guess no one's perfect, but he was still wrong.
3159240	3160440	Okay, that's all bye.
3160440	3162520	Listen to last week, part A, I called him on it.
3162520	3164620	He has, he has some good reasoning though.
3164620	3166240	So listen, take a, take a listen.
3166240	3167240	P.S.
3167240	3170520	Since the Wii is seventh generation and the Xbox 360 is second generation for Microsoft,
3170520	3175920	the term for Wii and 360 owners should actually be Wii 69.
3175920	3178320	I'm not sure how that math came about, but all right.
3178320	3179320	Okay.
3179320	3180320	We'll take it.
3180320	3181320	We have one from Lee.
3181320	3182320	Hi, Lee.
3182320	3184440	Who was apparently writing us from London.
3184440	3186080	Well, hello.
3186080	3187760	Hi, you guys.
3187760	3188760	Cheerio.
3188760	3191000	Would you like to sit down and have some tea and crumpets?
3191000	3196640	Hey, I got an email complimenting me on the British accent, by the way, to my personal
3196640	3197640	email box.
3197640	3198640	Really?
3198640	3199640	Yes.
3199640	3200640	Have I?
3200640	3201640	I don't know.
3201640	3202640	Let's not.
3202640	3203640	We're running long.
3203640	3204640	Let's get.
3204640	3210920	One thing I really like about being from Alabama, if you, if you look up, the Southern accent
3210920	3211920	is actually derived.
3211920	3212920	Balance, Jamie.
3212920	3213920	Balance.
3213920	3214920	I am going to talk about it.
3214920	3220560	The Southern accent is actually derived from the West England type, you know, region of
3220560	3221560	accent.
3221560	3222560	Did you read that on Wikipedia?
3222560	3224160	No, I didn't.
3224160	3226600	I actually took a linguistics class.
3226600	3227600	All right.
3227600	3228600	All right.
3228600	3229600	I'll talk to you though.
3229600	3230600	Anyway.
3230600	3231600	Back to the email.
3231600	3232600	Hi, you guys.
3232600	3234560	Just wanted to comment on your marketing strategy.
3234560	3239160	Rob suggested at the end of your last show that all listeners go out and let one person
3239160	3240160	know about OLR.
3240160	3244040	I think this may be an unnecessarily slow process and hamper your efforts at world media
3244040	3245040	domination.
3245040	3250040	If my maths is correct, and it most likely isn't, if all your listeners were to head
3250040	3254000	out and let two people know about OLR every week, and then the following week they all
3254000	3258280	in turn let two more people know, in about 30 weeks the entire population of the planet
3258280	3260240	would be listening to your show.
3260240	3264660	In your new position as world famous personalities, you could use the power of gaming to eradicate
3264660	3268400	world poverty, cure the common cold, and create a new utopian society.
3268400	3269400	Dude, utopian.
3269400	3270960	I love that word.
3270960	3272320	Just a suggestion though.
3272320	3273320	Cheers, Lee.
3273320	3275720	Lee, Lee, Lee.
3275720	3278560	Lee is the new marketing manager of Orange Lounge Radio.
3278560	3279560	I like the way you think, Lee.
3279560	3280560	Welcome aboard, Lee.
3280560	3281560	Welcome aboard.
3281560	3284400	Send me a plane ticket, please.
3284400	3286120	I like the way this man thinks.
3286120	3289920	Therefore, at the end of the show, I will from now, I will be encouraging everyone to
3289920	3294280	tell two people that now they have to tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio.
3294280	3297880	And you can all thank Lee for that.
3297880	3298880	I like the way he thinks.
3298880	3301000	That was brilliant.
3301000	3302000	Last email.
3302000	3303000	Yay.
3303000	3307320	Which is going to segment, or segue I should say, into another segment.
3307320	3308320	All right.
3308320	3309320	Oh.
3309320	3310320	Play my music, Rob.
3310320	3311320	Sure thing.
3311320	3323680	The website of the week, combined with this email from our friend, ApolloChon, good morning.
3323680	3326880	One of my friends, another listener, linked me to this site a few days ago, and I thought
3326880	3327880	it was cute.
3327880	3330640	Perhaps it could be a website of the week, or something of the sort.
3330640	3333080	It at least deserves an honorable mention.
3333080	3334080	Objection.
3334080	3336120	Which we have discussed on the site before.
3336120	3339960	I have seen previous user-made objections, so this is good.
3339960	3342600	It's about time we named this the site of the week.
3342600	3344600	However, it's about time.
3344600	3356720	So it's objection.mrdictionary.net.php, and we actually have one submitted in this email.
3356720	3359160	So you actually had an objection put in the email.
3359160	3363320	Yep, and it's loading the text right now.
3363320	3364320	Okay.
3364320	3365320	Okay.
3365320	3370520	Clearly, Dark Sakura should choose objection as the website of the week.
3370520	3376320	Evidence shows that it is 99% amazing.
3376320	3379680	I'd like to know what type of evidence that is, but all right.
3379680	3380680	We'll take it.
3380680	3384080	That sounds like one of my live channel entries to you.
3384080	3388080	Anyway, that'll do it for both the website of the week and for emails.
3388080	3389080	Keep them coming, y'all.
3389080	3390080	All right.
3390080	3393460	Any closing words you want to say to the listeners at home, Dark Sakura, before we vanish you
3393460	3396720	into what's current and live on the show right now?
3396720	3399160	I didn't say what I was playing this week.
3399160	3400160	All right.
3400160	3401160	Well, quickly tell us about your gaming week.
3401160	3402160	I played World of Warcraft.
3402160	3403160	Yeah?
3403160	3406400	Thanks to my dear best friend, Chris.
3406400	3407720	I am playing again.
3407720	3411760	I don't have Burning Crusade yet because, well, I have to pay $300 at the end of March
3411760	3416360	and $500 to buy a massage table in April, so I'm kind of broke.
3416360	3419360	However, I played my first human.
3419360	3422500	I played a warlock, and I hate kobolds.
3422500	3424040	What server are you on?
3424040	3425040	Ravencrest.
3425040	3426040	Ravencrest?
3426040	3427040	Oh, the server.
3427040	3428040	We all play it.
3428040	3429040	Wait a minute.
3429040	3430040	I was trying to say Ravenloft.
3430040	3431040	Wait, Ravencrest, but you're a human.
3431040	3432040	Yes.
3432040	3433040	What's your character's name?
3433040	3434040	I'm not telling you.
3434040	3435040	Oh, you can't say it on air.
3435040	3436040	Can you whisper it to me?
3436040	3437040	Can you mouth it?
3437040	3438040	Why?
3438040	3439040	Because you're going to hunt me down.
3439040	3440040	Yes, I'm a horde, so I'm going to hunt you down.
3440040	3442000	I'm going to kill you for making a character on the wrong side for the Horde.
3442000	3448200	I'm going to make a horde too, but my character's name is Lorcan, which if anybody ever reads
3448200	3455280	Anne Rice novels before she went stupid, it was a character in one of her last books,
3455280	3457060	one of her pre-stupidity books.
3457060	3459880	My character's name is posted, but if you want to know it, you have to go check the
3459880	3460880	forums.
3460880	3461880	Orangenotrader.com.
3461880	3462880	Forums.
3462880	3465000	My other characters are on Suramar.
3465000	3467000	I have a night elf on Suramar.
3467000	3470760	And then on Airy Peak, I have an undead.
3470760	3472600	Airy Peak is so 2006.
3472600	3477840	Well, my characters, I'm just glad they weren't deleted, because I didn't play for seven months.
3477840	3480880	And then they're still there.
3480880	3492280	And by the way, just an honorable mention, Misty has sent us 20,000 emails from her phone.
3492280	3494680	You can email, like mailbag getorangenotrader on your phone?
3494680	3495680	I can do that too.
3495680	3496680	Interesting.
3496680	3497680	But I like this one.
3497680	3499480	Hey, I miss you guys a lot.
3499480	3502600	I'm just going to go ahead and get a brand new computer once my tax money gets here.
3502600	3503600	Misty's funny.
3503600	3507440	She sends me a lot of random AOL messages too, but it's cool.
3507440	3508440	They make me chuckle.
3508440	3510580	Dude, it's the doctor.
3510580	3513380	On that note, we better go back to the present time.
3513380	3517580	So quickly, your final thought.
3517580	3524200	Anybody in the Sacramento, Roseville, Citrus Heights area, in April I will be a licensed
3524200	3528160	massage therapist and my rates are $75 an hour for me to come to your house and give
3528160	3529820	you the best massage ever.
3529820	3535040	Is this the Orange Ontario video game show or the massage show, because I'm starting
3535040	3536040	to wonder.
3536040	3539800	Will you massage people while they play video games, maybe?
3539800	3546000	I will do a special video game massage where I play the Final Fantasy Celtic Moon soundtrack
3546000	3547000	while rubbing your feet.
3547000	3548000	All right.
3548000	3549000	We got to go back.
3549000	3551640	So, Dark Sakura, have a lovely week off and take care.
3551640	3552640	Okay.
3552640	3553640	All right.
3553640	3556840	Through the magic of the space time continuum, that was Dark Sakura.
3556840	3558400	Thank you very much, Dark Sakura.
3558400	3560960	We miss you here live in the studio tonight, but our aim is improving.
3560960	3561960	I will have you know.
3561960	3562960	So it's very nice.
3562960	3563960	All right.
3563960	3564960	Well, let's get back into some news.
3564960	3568640	We got some news for you guys and this is kind of interesting.
3568640	3569640	Did you hear about this, Eddie?
3569640	3570640	I don't know.
3570640	3575120	Did you see the list that GamesRadar posted of the five game characters with one foot
3575120	3576120	in the closet?
3576120	3577880	I did not, but I'd love to hear it.
3577880	3580360	You might want to turn on that mic.
3580360	3581880	I did not, but I'd love to hear it.
3581880	3585220	Well, I don't know if I want to really read the whole list, but basically it was a bit
3585220	3586640	of a controversial article.
3586640	3592800	They said Kratos from God of War, Marcus Fenix from Gears of War, Frank West from Dead Rising
3592800	3595400	and Vaan from Final Fantasy XII.
3595400	3596400	That's true.
3596400	3600980	But what's interesting is kind of the way they went about saying it is they used a lot
3600980	3608160	of gay stereotypes, like so and so is cross dresses, so he must be gay because he looks
3608160	3610920	like a chick, so he must be gay.
3610920	3611920	That's stupid.
3611920	3612920	That's pretty dumb.
3612920	3616680	And what's interesting is it caught the radar of Gay.com, which is not a gaming site.
3616680	3617680	It's a gay site.
3617680	3622060	It caught the radar of Gay.com's UK edition as well as another site, Pink News.
3622060	3626400	And they publicly yelled at these games' radar articles.
3626400	3629800	Pink News said, quote, what is the point of outing characters?
3629800	3633920	Is this yet another bunch of childish straight boys laughing at gay people?
3633920	3639460	And the author of the Gay.com article was elaborating that the article had a very facetious
3639460	3644800	tone to it and basically was making jokes about the LGBT community.
3644800	3649320	And I guess because they pegged Frank West as being gay because he dresses up in women's
3649320	3653080	clothes and children's clothes for a bit of carnal experimentation.
3653080	3658760	Yeah, I mean, gamer guys are, the subculture.
3658760	3660280	Not the ones that listen to this show.
3660280	3664660	I mean, we're all cool, but the subculture, like in general, does seem to be kind of homophobic.
3664660	3665920	That's the tone.
3665920	3670820	I think anyway, I mean, like you said, like the guys that make the games with like boobs
3670820	3674440	and stuff, you know, which is like every game, you know, yeah, I can see that where they'd
3674440	3676800	be like kind of homophobic.
3676800	3678560	They make hot guys too.
3678560	3682080	Have you never played any of the Castlevania games, where the hell have you been?
3682080	3684520	I mean, it's like, what is that one game that came out, God Hand?
3684520	3689200	I mean, it's like, that game is like pretty ripping on gay people and like, like I haven't
3689200	3690200	seen this game.
3690200	3691960	Yeah, the God Hand, it's for PS2.
3691960	3695600	I mean, the game looks pretty good, but it's like, it's pretty over the top, like just
3695600	3697600	porn for like 14 year old straight guys.
3697600	3701820	Like you can like spank, but only the female characters and like there's these like really
3701820	3704940	flaming like gay villains.
3704940	3709640	The whole game is supposed to be, it's a parody on like Kung Fu games or whatever.
3709640	3713680	It's, it's like a Kung Fu hustle, the game is basically what it's supposed to be.
3713680	3714680	Yeah.
3714680	3717400	But like in every trailer they show like the spank attack, you know, and the, but you could
3717400	3719120	only spank the female villains.
3719120	3720120	Like they didn't program it.
3720120	3721120	You could just spank anyone.
3721120	3724080	So the, I don't know, that's pretty like one sided to me.
3724080	3725080	Interesting.
3725080	3726080	I don't know.
3726080	3730400	I read the original list, the games radar posted, I just thought it was stupid.
3730400	3734800	Like it was like, it's like when someone tells a joke and no one laughs and believe me, I
3734800	3737240	know that feeling very well here on this program.
3737240	3740840	You know, that's kind of like what I felt this guy's article was, is that like, like
3740840	3744440	some genius on one of these board meetings was said, Hey, let's do an article on like
3744440	3745960	gay guys in video games.
3745960	3747520	And I don't think it was meant maliciously.
3747520	3749640	So I don't get my feathers ruffled about it.
3749640	3752840	Like I just look at it and go, wow, that's just stupid.
3752840	3753840	Yeah.
3753840	3755000	I don't get offended about it.
3755000	3758320	I just go, okay dude.
3758320	3759320	Right.
3759320	3760320	Sure dude.
3760320	3761320	Dude.
3761320	3762320	Yeah.
3762320	3763320	Sure dude.
3763320	3764880	I think Gears of War is totally gay.
3764880	3765880	Yeah.
3765880	3766880	You got it.
3766880	3767880	Yeah.
3767880	3770240	Cause he, you know, thinking about his buddies too much and all that.
3770240	3775600	And Kratos is totally gay because he doesn't like bang two chicks at the same time in two
3775600	3776600	different games.
3776600	3777600	Uh huh.
3777600	3778600	Uh huh.
3778600	3779600	And he doesn't wipe his ass with tree bark.
3779600	3783280	I mean, where was Makoto on the list?
3783280	3784720	Like that's the reason I didn't take the list.
3784720	3788720	Well, I guess maybe because it was about closeted game characters, whereas Makoto in enchanted
3788720	3793280	arms was a, you know, he was a, he was a very, if I ever saw one in the cosmos.
3793280	3794280	Yeah.
3794280	3796160	Or with his ginormous package.
3796160	3799920	Or where is King, the biggest lesbian in all of video games?
3799920	3800920	Oh my God.
3800920	3801920	She's totally a lesbian.
3801920	3802920	Yeah.
3802920	3803920	I'm kind of with you guys.
3803920	3804920	She's like one of my favorite characters.
3804920	3805920	I don't really care.
3805920	3806920	Yeah.
3806920	3807920	I don't really care.
3807920	3808920	I mean, whoa.
3808920	3812200	You know, it's like, I just, you know, I want there to be a game where you spank guys.
3812200	3815360	You like, you like Sims type games where you can just do whatever you want.
3815360	3816360	Yeah.
3816360	3817360	Pretty much.
3817360	3818360	Yeah.
3818360	3821720	As long as they let me do stuff to guys in the games.
3821720	3822720	Only willy ones, of course.
3822720	3823720	Yeah.
3823720	3824720	Well, yeah, no.
3824720	3825720	Yeah.
3825720	3826720	Of course.
3826720	3827720	I mean, geez.
3827720	3828720	Come on now.
3828720	3829720	Uh-huh.
3829720	3830720	Come on.
3830720	3831720	You guys are gay.
3831720	3832720	Uh, let's see.
3832720	3835240	James Patrick says, uh, God ham, the main character is gay, right?
3835240	3836240	Or becomes gay.
3836240	3837760	That's what the X-Play video seemed to suggest.
3837760	3838760	Yeah.
3838760	3839760	Of course.
3839760	3840760	That's a lot of things.
3840760	3845280	A lot of X-Play videos suggest gay themes for games and that's, that's kind of what
3845280	3846640	this article struck me as.
3846640	3848200	It was like an X-Play review.
3848200	3851760	Like it's trying like way too hard to be funny, but I just don't laugh.
3851760	3854040	That's what it is.
3854040	3855040	Yep.
3855040	3856040	All right.
3856040	3857040	So, that's it.
3857040	3858480	I don't have my feathers ruffled over it.
3858480	3861640	I just kind of go, game's radar is wearing enough egg on their face over it.
3861640	3864680	I don't need to be able to sit here, oh, it's homophobic and blah, blah, blah.
3864680	3865680	No, it wasn't.
3865680	3866680	It was just stupid.
3866680	3867680	There's a difference.
3867680	3869200	There's a difference between homophobia and stupid.
3869200	3871560	Nobody really cares about you guys, so.
3871560	3872560	Yeah.
3872560	3876440	So, every month it seems to be that there is a story out there about somebody killing
3876440	3881200	somebody and somehow they're tying it into violent video games and that was the case
3881200	3885120	also with a Milwaukee murder.
3885120	3892680	Fifteen-year-old Nathan Moore was a murderer of Rex Bomb, an alcoholic transient, and apparently
3892680	3897400	this Nathan Moore was quoted saying it was just like a violent video game.
3897400	3900640	You know, killing the guy reminded him of a violent video game.
3900640	3906160	So, of course everyone went, ah, it's games to blame and stuff like that.
3906160	3915440	Um, the one, the stepmom of Nathan actually was a dedicated Penny Arcade reader and she
3915440	3919560	actually wrote him a letter regarding the whole thing and it's actually quite interesting
3919560	3925040	because they talk about how, you know, the kid is just kind of just crazy, doesn't, you
3925040	3929800	know, getting in trouble in every which way and, you know, doesn't, she basically points
3929800	3935000	out it's not the game, not video games fault and it did not make him who he was.
3935000	3939800	He was already fucked up to begin with, so, um, I do think it's kind of interesting though
3939800	3945040	at least there's someone out there that's willing to say, hey, this is not the case.
3945040	3949920	Um, and I believe someone pointed out, I can't remember where it was, but they pointed out
3949920	3954160	that, you know, he may be crazy, but he's not stupid.
3954160	3959360	He knows that he can get like some sort of like crazy, um, insanity plea with, you know,
3959360	3963000	saying that, oh, video games made me do it type of thing.
3963000	3967880	So I think he's just trying to use that, you know, kind of to get off a little bit.
3967880	3973680	I don't know, but get off, get off from being, you know, I love, we can always count on the
3973680	3975360	serious perspective from rice princess.
3975360	3977360	Do you have any serious thoughts on this?
3977360	3978360	Yeah.
3978360	3979360	That was it.
3979360	3980360	I farted.
3980360	3981360	Yeah.
3981360	3988360	Everybody's saying goodbye to rice princess folks, she won't be back last week.
3988360	3991960	Um, anybody have any comments on that?
3991960	3995160	I do.
3995160	4001140	Moving right along then, you guys are assholes, um, Microsoft has been caught in a lawsuit
4001140	4008680	and a federal jury ordered Microsoft to pay $1.5 billion, uh, to the, uh, telecom group
4008680	4015240	Actel Lucent, no Alcatel, Alcatel, like Alcatel Lucent, uh, for violating two patents related
4015240	4016240	to digital music.
4016240	4020080	Basically it all has to do with MP3 encoding and decoding, uh, and that has to do with
4020080	4021080	Windows media player.
4021080	4023560	They're going, what the hell does this have to do with gaming?
4023560	4028320	Well, uh, it's because a part of this suit has to do with speech coding and video coding
4028320	4033600	used in the Xbox 360, which makes you go, Hmm, will future Microsoft's products be hampered
4033600	4034720	by this?
4034720	4038040	Or is this just a case of a jury wanting to get back at Microsoft because you know, they're
4038040	4039560	evil or whatever it is.
4039560	4043360	I think that they're just going to pay this and unlike, you know, Sony, they're actually
4043360	4048480	going to, you know, pay for the rights or whatever that they may have infringed on and
4048480	4051120	just license them.
4051120	4053520	I think they do that actually for the rumble technology.
4053520	4059600	They license the rumbling patents or whatever, although some companies decide to remove them
4059600	4063180	altogether because they don't want to shell out money.
4063180	4064180	But whatever.
4064180	4070280	So, um, you know, on a completely different topic though, um, you got to love the Russians
4070280	4075800	and they came up with this wonder, you know, and this is like a, such a horrible stereotype,
4075800	4083600	but um, they've come up with a Russian, a massively multiplayer online drinking game.
4083600	4086280	Oh my God, that's awesome.
4086280	4092720	And apparently it's, um, you would take this special shot glass that will plug into your
4092720	4094840	computer via USB.
4094840	4098400	And when you logged into a special chat room, the glass keeps track of how much alcohol
4098400	4101680	you have left just to make sure that you're keeping up.
4101680	4105240	Um, so that, I don't know.
4105240	4107280	If I put water in it.
4107280	4109160	Well, I suppose you could.
4109160	4110160	Ha!
4110160	4111160	I fooled the computer.
4111160	4114800	Well, aren't you elite hacker?
4114800	4117360	I hack sword your shot glass.
4117360	4118800	With water.
4118800	4124200	Or can't you just like pour it out into another cup or, you know, like there's tons of different
4124200	4125200	ways you could hack into it.
4125200	4127040	Or how does it all, give it all to Irene because she's poor and can't afford it.
4127040	4130960	Well, could you just go on one of those adult sites and put up a picture of somebody else?
4130960	4132320	I mean, that's about the same.
4132320	4137320	Or can't you just like drink at home, like with your friends and not have to do it on
4137320	4139440	the computer with a bunch of people you don't know?
4139440	4141720	Like, that's pretty sad.
4141720	4145440	This sounds to be, to be honest, this sounds like something that they would have in like
4145440	4146440	Second Life.
4146440	4152000	Uh, Cane VM says, uh, in our chat room again, chat.orangehelter.com, Cane VM says, MMO drinking?
4152000	4153000	Hell yeah.
4153000	4154640	Black Boy says, that game sounds awesome.
4154640	4157800	Uh, Blaze says, innocent people will die over this game.
4157800	4160840	And GS68 says, you'll die of water intoxication.
4160840	4161840	That's true.
4161840	4162840	That's Sacramento.
4162840	4165640	And, uh, apparently people like to do that here.
4165640	4166640	Oh God.
4166640	4167640	Um.
4167640	4168640	What?
4168640	4169640	It's true.
4169640	4170640	Too soon.
4170640	4171640	Too soon.
4171640	4172640	Don't give me that.
4172640	4173640	Okay.
4173640	4174640	Yeah.
4174640	4176360	You know, all those people that made those comments were like under 21 and like, oh my
4176360	4177360	God, he's so cool.
4177360	4178360	He's drinking game.
4178360	4183840	I don't think Black Boy, what Black Boy participates in, uh, uh, I know they call it Free Play
4183840	4188040	Friday, but I call it Drunken Orgy over at All Games on Fridays.
4188040	4189040	So I think he's over 21.
4189040	4190040	Oh man.
4190040	4191040	They have Drunken Orgies?
4191040	4193680	Uh, we got to pick up the slack here.
4193680	4194680	This is Zippy Orgies.
4194680	4195680	Oh, I'm sorry.
4195680	4198360	Oh, it is, it is, uh, the end of February sweeps.
4198360	4200480	How are we going to top that on the All Games Network?
4200480	4201480	We need to be pulling some ice cream.
4201480	4203000	We're going to murder someone live on here.
4203000	4204000	I know.
4204000	4205000	All right.
4205000	4206000	Bye Rob.
4206000	4207000	And you wondered why Lanky Style came back.
4207000	4208000	All right.
4208000	4210000	Lanky Style, just put this plastic bag on your head and I got a rubber band.
4210000	4211000	I'm, I can't.
4211000	4212000	Too soon.
4212000	4213000	Too soon.
4213000	4214000	I love you.
4214000	4215000	Hearts to you.
4215000	4216000	He's really acknowledging me.
4216000	4220000	I know how we can, I know how we can pull through the sweeps.
4220000	4225040	Oh man, our ratings are number one.
4225040	4231080	Um, so anyway, let's go back to, all right, well, no, I know exactly how we can pull through
4231080	4232080	for sweeps.
4232080	4233080	Are you okay?
4233080	4234080	Lanky Style?
4234080	4235080	I didn't, I didn't mean it.
4235080	4236520	An apology to Lanky Style?
4236520	4238520	I think he's giving me poundy face.
4238520	4241040	It's like unsubscribe, unsubscribe right there.
4241040	4242040	All right.
4242040	4243040	Anyway.
4243040	4244040	Don't misrepresent me.
4244040	4245040	What?
4245040	4246040	I said, don't misrepresent me.
4246040	4247040	At least I probably got you to talk.
4247040	4248040	Fuck.
4248040	4249040	All right.
4249040	4250040	You're mean now, Rob.
4250040	4251040	I know.
4251040	4252040	I'm, I'm a jerk.
4252040	4253040	All right.
4253040	4254040	Let's see.
4254040	4256080	I'm looking at chat room.
4256080	4259720	Black Boy says, did anyone see the photo of me teabagging stalker Oscar?
4259720	4262520	See look, we're going to lose sweeps, you guys, we're going to fucking lose.
4262520	4263520	Oh man.
4263520	4264520	Against this.
4264520	4265520	Come on.
4265520	4266520	Teabagging?
4266520	4267520	That's it.
4267520	4268520	I got to, that's it.
4268520	4269520	I'm going to have to go and teabag rice princess right now.
4269520	4270520	Get the hell away from me.
4270520	4271520	He's really walking towards me.
4271520	4272520	Bend over.
4272520	4273520	Ah.
4273520	4274520	Ah.
4274520	4275520	No.
4275520	4276520	All right.
4276520	4277520	Got a face full of crotch.
4277520	4278520	How much do I owe you?
4278520	4280080	Well, it's a nice segment, which is a great sweeps trick.
4280080	4283840	It's playing a good old fashioned game here on Orange Lounge Radio and we have a game
4283840	4285840	called Beat the Host.
4285840	4290600	And we asked to qualify our question earlier in chat and that was which board does Pac-Man
4290600	4291840	crash on?
4291840	4293360	And we have our winner on the line.
4293360	4294720	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

4477160	4479640	used to do we have to say it all at the end you're gonna say it while it's going
4479640	4482680	on and tonight he's a killer you're probably gonna run through a bunch of
4482680	4486560	games until you get it right but if I don't say anything then you haven't
4486560	4489760	guessed it right yet all right all right Loki is now going to leave the
4489760	4495440	family and head to our isolation booth somebody keep an eye on him

4596920	4621240	I
4626920	4646920	I do know this one, but I forget what it is, so I'm going to pass on that.
4646920	4647920	All right.
4647920	4648920	Fifteen.
4648920	4649920	Master us.
4649920	4650920	Five, no.
4650920	4651920	Four.
4651920	4652920	Three.
4652920	4653920	Pass.
4653920	4654920	Two.
4654920	4655920	One.
4655920	4656920	Make the point.
4656920	4658480	This is a tough category tonight.
4658480	4659760	Our chat room is even struggling at times.
4659760	4662400	But you did get two right and that may be enough to beat Loki.
4662400	4668320	I don't know, my classic arcade game knowledge is a little limited on that one, fortunately,
4668320	4669480	but good luck, Loki.
4669480	4670480	All right.
4670480	4671480	Well, here we go.
4671480	4672480	We're going to bring Loki back in studio.
4672480	4673720	If Lanky style would please go grab Loki.
4673720	4674720	How was Lanky style doing?
4674720	4677200	He actually got a few of them, yeah.
4677200	4678800	He would have been a very formidable opponent.
4678800	4679800	All right.
4679800	4681200	Well, it's a good thing Rob D didn't pick him.
4681200	4682200	Yeah.
4682200	4683200	I'm glad he picked a total loser like Loki.
4683200	4684200	Hi, Lanky.
4684200	4685200	How you doing?
4685200	4689200	Loki's wearing the wedding shirt that Jamie and I got him, the one that says Game Over.
4689200	4693400	Yes. Alright, well I can't tell you what Rob D got just yet, but
4693400	4696600	we'll see, it's a tough category. Anyway, I need you to look that way. Alright,
4696600	4700240	and you're going to name off, because I don't want him to see what songs are on screen. So here we go.
4700240	4703800	Again, just say pass. If you want to pass, you have two minutes, and your two minutes
4703800	4706800	starts right now.
4706800	4715800	Bubble Wobble. Yes.
4715800	4724800	Pass.
4728800	4738800	Dig Dug. No. Mr. Do. No. Burger Time. Yes.
4738800	4743800	Pass.
4751800	4755800	Pass.
4755800	4769800	Contra. No. Pass. Pass.
4771800	4775800	Dig Dug. Yes.
4778800	4782800	Pass.
4782800	4785800	45 seconds.
4788800	4791800	Pass.
4796800	4802800	30 seconds. Pass. In fact, the one you passed the first time.
4802800	4811800	1942. No. Time travel. No.
4812800	4816800	19 seconds.
4819800	4828800	8, 7, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. All done.
4828800	4832800	Alright, let's add it up. Let's see how you guys did.
4832800	4837800	Rob D got two right, but Loki got three right. Loki, you win.
4837800	4841800	You know, a lot of them I recognized, and I was like, I couldn't play them.
4841800	4845800	It was really hard tonight. Chadron was doing very well, though. Rob D, I'm so sorry you didn't win.
4845800	4849800	That happens. Good job, Loki. Alright, better luck next time, though. You want to hear the right answers, though?
4849800	4852800	I bet you want to know them, because this is the party. Ah, yes I do. Ah, dammit.
4852800	4855800	Are we allowed to guess them? Were Tempest and Bubble Wobble in there?
4855800	4858800	Ah, yes, they both were. What were you thinking, Rice Princess?
4858800	4860800	Are we allowed to guess them as you go on? Sure, why not?
4860800	4863800	Okay, so just play them. We didn't cheat, though, because the names are up on the screen.
4863800	4865800	No, I can't even see from there. Okay, good. Here we go.
4865800	4868800	What do you think, Rice Princess? Well, this is Bubble Wobble. Loki guessed that one.
4868800	4870800	What do you think this one is?
4871800	4874800	Robotron? No. Oh.
4874800	4877800	I have no fucking clue. Tempest, that's one.
4877800	4881800	Alright, somebody got this. This is for her time.
4881800	4885800	We both got that, actually.
4888800	4890800	Yeah, I've got no clue. No idea?
4890800	4894800	Nope. Even, I think if I let it go in here a little bit more, it'll be here.
4894800	4896800	Hold on.
4897800	4900800	I think it's right here. You might recognize this.
4902800	4905800	You remember that? Crystal Castles! Crystal Castles.
4905800	4908800	Oh, yeah. Alright, this is Frogger.
4908800	4911800	And that's Frogger.
4911800	4915800	This one's a real toughie. I don't know if anyone got this right.
4917800	4919800	This song's so familiar.
4921800	4924800	1943. 1943. Oh, God.
4924800	4929800	Dig Dug. This one's Dig Dug. Somebody got that one right? Dig Dug?
4929800	4932800	This is a tough one. I think somebody in the studio said it, though.
4932800	4935800	This could be Zaxxon. It is a Zaxxon. Damn it!
4935800	4939800	Zaxxon. Good job. This one's one of my favorites.
4944800	4949800	I'll give you a hint, because in the balls of penguins, Sega made.
4950800	4953800	Push cubes around and squish little blobs.
4954800	4956800	Tango! Tango!
4956800	4966800	Okay, this one is a killer. I don't know if anyone got this one. I wasn't watching chat.
4966800	4968800	Namco made.
4968800	4971800	In most of their selections of games.
4972800	4974800	Knights of the Round? Nope.
4974800	4976800	Sword game.
4976800	4979800	Incredibly slow-moving character.
4979800	4983800	The Tower of Druaga. The Tower of Druaga was the last one.
4983800	4986800	I know. I'm like, what? I said it was a killer.
4986800	4990800	There it was. Your ten songs. Bubble Bobble. Tempest. Burger Time. Crystal Castles. Frogger.
4990800	4993800	1943. Dig Dug. Zaxxon. Pengo. Tower of Druaga.
4993800	4997800	That was a killer, but Rob D., you made a good showing, and we appreciate your participation.
4997800	5000800	All right. Thanks for taking my call, and thanks for letting me participate.
5000800	5004800	As a consolation prize, a lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni.
5004800	5005800	All right. Sounds great.
5005800	5006800	All right. Have a good one.
5006800	5008800	San Francisco treat. I know. I'll see you guys later.
5008800	5009800	All right. Later, buddy.
5009800	5011800	Rice Princess-A-Roni.
5011800	5013800	Rice Princess-A-Roni?
5013800	5014800	Yeah, sure.
5014800	5016800	All right. There you go.
5016800	5017800	All right.
5017800	5021800	Dark Tetsuya said he would have gotten five, and he knew the Tower of Druaga.
5021800	5024800	Looks like some folks knew Pengo. That was very good.
5024800	5027800	You know, Zaxxon sounded so familiar, and then I just had to think about it for a little bit.
5027800	5029800	I'm like, aw, crap.
5029800	5031800	That was a tough one, because I knew...
5031800	5034800	And by the way, I pulled all those games off GameTap earlier today,
5034800	5036800	because they have a bunch of those games,
5036800	5039800	and it's really easy for me to dump when the game is on the computer, the audio.
5039800	5044800	And when I picked Zaxxon at first, I was like, oh, it'll be easy to recognize.
5044800	5046800	And like I was playing, I was like, this is really hard.
5046800	5049800	Maybe I should switch it out, but no, I kept it in there.
5049800	5052800	But the Tower of Druaga, man, that's killer.
5052800	5053800	That was freaking killer.
5053800	5055800	Really cool. You should do old PC games or something like that,
5055800	5057800	because no one would get that stuff.
5057800	5061800	All right. Rob D. and Chad, he's back in Chad and yelling,
5061800	5063800	I'm pissed at myself for not knowing Tempest and Dig Dug.
5063800	5066800	I purposely put in some Xbox ones there, like Frogger and Dig Dug.
5066800	5067800	So there you have it.
5067800	5069800	We hope you enjoy Beat the Host.
5069800	5071800	How did you guys do? Would you have gotten all ten?
5071800	5073800	Would you have beat Loki? Only you know.
5073800	5075800	Be honest, no cheating on your honor.
5075800	5078800	All right, we've got a couple more gaming news stories for you guys,
5078800	5081800	and then we're going to get back into the phones,
5081800	5083800	take a couple more phone calls before we say good night.
5083800	5087800	And speaking of music, because we just played a game about video game music,
5087800	5091800	who doesn't love Koji Kondo, if you know who he is anyway?
5091800	5092800	He's the author.
5092800	5093800	Zelda.
5093800	5096800	Yeah, he made Legend of Zelda music, Star Fox, Mario.
5096800	5098800	I mean, the guy's a legend, right?
5098800	5102800	Well, he is going to be performing at Video Games Live
5102800	5104800	this year in San Francisco.
5104800	5106800	That's March 9th at 8 p.m.
5106800	5109800	That's the show during the Game Developers Conference,
5109800	5111800	which I may or may not be going to.
5111800	5113800	I'm still trying to work out some last-minute details.
5113800	5117800	I'm hoping to go to the Game Developers Conference
5117800	5119800	with the All Games crew, but we'll see.
5119800	5120800	Yeah, they did something like that in Japan,
5120800	5124800	where they actually had an orchestral concert of all the Nintendo music.
5124800	5127800	I guess there's words to the Epona song from Ocarina of Time
5127800	5129800	that this woman was opera singing.
5129800	5131800	It was pretty crazy.
5131800	5133800	There you go.
5133800	5135800	I really want to go just to see this.
5135800	5136800	I think it would be great.
5136800	5138800	A lot of the songs they play at a Video Games Live,
5138800	5141800	I don't know if I get, but I think it would be really cool.
5141800	5145800	I did not get into some of the LucasArts games like a lot of people did.
5145800	5147800	I do love Loom and Monkey Island, some of that stuff,
5147800	5150800	but apparently they're going to have some LucasArts stuff,
5150800	5152800	and apparently there's going to be a Contra presentation,
5152800	5153800	which should be interesting.
5153800	5155800	But when I think about Contra, I don't think about the music.
5155800	5156800	Does it just mean?
5156800	5157800	I don't know.
5157800	5160800	Some of the last games were pretty heavy metal,
5160800	5162800	which would be kind of cool to see for formula.
5162800	5164800	Oh yeah, Kira. That would be awesome.
5164800	5165800	All right.
5165800	5167800	Well, I guess we've got one more story for you guys tonight,
5167800	5170800	and then we're going to open up the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR.
5170800	5176800	So the big story is Itagaki is working on something new
5176800	5179800	and something that doesn't have to do with boobies apparently.
5179800	5181800	Is it Day Rape?
5181800	5182800	No, it's not Day Rape.
5182800	5183800	He got it.
5183800	5184800	But here's the thing, though.
5184800	5187800	Everyone's thinking this is going to be a big thing,
5187800	5191800	but he did everybody party or every party or whatever,
5191800	5194800	so he has done different things.
5194800	5198800	So he's working on a new project that's not going to be DOA related.
5198800	5200800	He says, I'll be announcing such a game in the new future,
5200800	5202800	the title of the game aside.
5202800	5206800	It's like no other type of game I've ever made.
5206800	5207800	Hooray.
5207800	5213800	So I will have news about an amazing game soon.
5213800	5214800	Why?
5214800	5215800	We're back to that again.
5215800	5217800	Did you see me in Almond Joy here?
5217800	5218800	Oh, yay.
5218800	5219800	Oh, sorry.
5219800	5220800	We're on the air.
5220800	5221800	I love Almond Joy.
5221800	5222800	Coconut.
5222800	5223800	Dude, almonds.
5223800	5225800	Or as my dad would say, Ammon Joy.
5225800	5226800	Oh, it's shaped like an egg.
5226800	5227800	I can shove it up your ass.
5227800	5228800	You'd probably like that.
5228800	5229800	You have some ammons?
5229800	5230800	Some ammons?
5230800	5231800	That's what my dad's going to say.
5231800	5232800	You like ammons?
5232800	5234800	Ammons are crunchy?
5234800	5237800	You know they have a big ammon factory in downtown Sacramento.
5237800	5238800	Oh, yeah?
5238800	5239800	Diamond.
5239800	5240800	Have you ever driven by it?
5240800	5241800	Video game.
5241800	5242800	Oh, yeah.
5242800	5243800	Oh, yeah.
5243800	5244800	We're on a video game show.
5244800	5246800	Well, I guess we should let some callers call in and direct the show otherwise.
5246800	5247800	1877 Game OLR.
5247800	5249800	There's always our Skype line username, OrangeLawnTradio.
5249800	5255800	There's more information on our website, www.orangelawntradio.com, by clicking on interact with us.
5255800	5256800	Let's go to the phones.
5256800	5257800	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnTradio.
5257800	5258800	Who's this?
5258800	5259800	Raven's Dolphin.
5259800	5260800	Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
5260800	5262800	Oh, I got time to eat my egg here.
5262800	5263800	You like Almond Joys?
5263800	5264800	I love Almond Joys.
5264800	5265800	I know.
5265800	5266800	It's good stuff.
5266800	5267800	All right.
5267800	5268800	What's on your mind, buddy?
5268800	5270800	I was waiting for you to get to my call all night.
5270800	5275800	I was so excited to tell you that I knew that you pulled it off GameTab.
5275800	5277800	Nine out of the ten games are on GameTab.
5277800	5279800	Ten out of the ten games are on GameTab.
5279800	5280800	Really?
5280800	5284800	I just didn't want it to sound like, you know, I don't know, that they were like, they paid
5284800	5285800	us off to be.
5285800	5289800	No, I did it from GameTab because it's easy that way, to be honest.
5289800	5291800	And they do have a lot of classic games on there.
5291800	5295800	I like GameTab, especially Abe Lincoln Must Die.
5295800	5296800	I haven't even played that.
5296800	5297800	What the hell is that?
5297800	5298800	That sounds awesome.
5298800	5299800	That's the new Sam and Max episode.
5299800	5302800	Oh, no, I need to play the Sam and Max games.
5302800	5307800	If you played Sam and Max, you would know, does the carpet match the drapes?
5307800	5309800	I don't want to know the answer to that.
5309800	5312800	I seriously need to ban myself from World of Warcraft for a week so I can play some
5312800	5314800	of these computer games I've been missing.
5314800	5316800	Have you checked out Missed Online?
5316800	5320800	I haven't gotten missed through, but I heard it's great.
5320800	5321800	I want to.
5321800	5323800	Are you a fan of Missed?
5323800	5324800	Eddie?
5324800	5326800	I'm a huge fan of Missed.
5326800	5327800	I love Missed.
5327800	5328800	It's awesome.
5328800	5330800	And, yeah, it's cool.
5330800	5332800	I'm surprised you don't know about Missed Online then.
5332800	5333800	It just opened up on Valentine's Day.
5333800	5334800	I know.
5334800	5337800	Eddie has this, like, Christmas little boy face on right now.
5337800	5341800	Well, yeah, because I'm like probably the only person who still likes point-and-click
5341800	5342800	games where I'm like, oh, I missed.
5342800	5343800	Click games?
5343800	5344800	Point-and-click.
5344800	5345800	All right.
5345800	5346800	Ravenstaufen, one more question.
5346800	5348800	What else are on your mind tonight?
5348800	5352800	I got a phone to pick with Loki.
5352800	5354800	All right.
5354800	5356800	Loki, Ravenstaufen's going to pick your bones.
5356800	5357800	Ew.
5357800	5358800	All right.
5358800	5359800	What's on your mind?
5359800	5363800	Loki, you said about 15-inch television.
5363800	5368800	I own a 50-inch television and I'm not gay, and you said go buy a PC monitor.
5368800	5369800	I don't have money.
5369800	5374800	My mom said, here, have this 15-inch HDTV monitor.
5374800	5376800	Wouldn't you like it for games?
5376800	5377800	And I said, yes.
5377800	5381800	When in the hell did he say that 15-inch monitors made you gay?
5381800	5383800	I don't even remember saying that.
5383800	5385800	I never said that.
5385800	5389800	Oh, when you were on all games on Monday, you must have said it.
5389800	5390800	I don't even remember saying that.
5390800	5391800	You know what?
5391800	5394800	Scott totally sets us up to say mean things so we get angry listeners.
5394800	5399800	No, I think what I was saying, I think what I was saying, I can't remember.
5399800	5402800	I swear to God, every time I've been on that program, he tries to get me to talk about
5402800	5403800	another podcast.
5403800	5408800	Someone had a 15-inch LCD TV or whatever and they spent, I forget how much money on it,
5408800	5412800	and I said, well, you should just go buy a fucking monitor because they're a lot cheaper
5412800	5420800	and you can get a 19-inch or even a 21-inch or whatever and you can do HD on a PC monitor,
5420800	5425800	so just spend the money on that instead.
5425800	5426800	Yeah.
5426800	5428800	All right, well, there.
5428800	5432800	I never said gay, though, ever in that argument.
5432800	5434800	I said retarded but not gay.
5434800	5435800	I was improv-ing.
5435800	5436800	All right.
5436800	5437800	What else?
5437800	5438800	One more thing.
5438800	5440800	It's always one more thing.
5440800	5441800	All right.
5441800	5442800	It's your trademark, though.
5442800	5443800	You know?
5443800	5444800	Yeah.
5444800	5445800	You should have.
5445800	5446800	Do you have a Myspace Ravenstaufen?
5446800	5447800	Yes, I do.
5447800	5448800	Okay, yeah.
5448800	5450800	I was going to say, you need to get one and put a little picture of yourself on there
5450800	5454800	with little text underneath it that says, one more thing, and you should have a little
5454800	5456800	picture of you going with the hand.
5456800	5457800	One.
5457800	5458800	Of course.
5458800	5459800	All right.
5459800	5460800	Forget it.
5460800	5461800	What's your one more thing?
5461800	5464800	My headset is orange for Orange Lounge Radio.
5464800	5465800	Aww.
5465800	5468800	I just threw up in my mouth.
5468800	5469800	All right.
5469800	5470800	Thanks, Ravenstaufen.
5470800	5471800	You're cool.
5471800	5472800	You too.
5472800	5473800	Bye.
5473800	5474800	All right.
5474800	5475800	Take care.
5475800	5476800	Bye.
5476800	5477800	Let's go to another phone call.
5477800	5478800	What was that?
5478800	5479800	What the hell did I do there?
5479800	5480800	I have no idea.
5480800	5482800	I'm eagerly anticipating chicken shoot.
5482800	5484800	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5484800	5485800	Who's this?
5485800	5487800	Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.
5487800	5488800	Hi, Paradox Vincent.
5488800	5489800	What's on your mind?
5489800	5491800	Not much.
5491800	5493800	Not much?
5493800	5497800	Well, what the hell are you calling us for tonight?
5497800	5501800	What do you want to talk to us about?
5501800	5514800	I just think that on the Best Buy story, did that cover the internal, the whole scandal
5514800	5519800	on their big internal internet, the external internet website?
5519800	5522800	No, we did not cover that story.
5522800	5523800	What the hell is this about?
5523800	5526800	So the Best Buy, their internal is the external site?
5526800	5527800	What's this about?
5527800	5534800	Well, basically, I've heard that they'll offer sales on their external website, which
5534800	5541800	you can access from their home, and they'll say, oh, well, there's a sale on this, so
5541800	5548800	I want to go pick it up, this camera that's been discounted down to 130.
5548800	5552800	But then you go into the store and they won't let you have it.
5552800	5557800	Yeah, and then they say, oh, that sale ended at seven plus time, and you said, well, I
5557800	5558800	checked the website.
5558800	5561800	And they say, oh, the website must have been responding slowly.
5561800	5566800	Let's go check this one in store, and then they'll go check it and show you, see where
5566800	5568800	it ended at this date.
5568800	5572800	And I just think that too.
5572800	5577800	Well, to be fair paradox, Vincent, there's a lot of stores that do the online only deals,
5577800	5581800	like I've shopped at circuitcity.com, and I believe that's the site.
5581800	5585800	Please don't quote me on this, but I believe that's the site that won't show you what the
5585800	5588800	sale price is until you put it in your cart.
5588800	5592800	And then you have Walmart and Target both sell things on their website that they don't
5592800	5593800	even sell in the store.
5593800	5597800	The reason why they don't show you that price on there is because sometimes they will have
5597800	5602800	an agreement with the publisher or whoever that they have a minimum advertised price,
5602800	5606800	which they cannot advertise a price lower than that, or in other words, they won't get
5606800	5608800	their co-op dollars to advertise.
5608800	5611800	They get paid by these companies to advertise their products.
5611800	5615800	I am surprised, though, that Best Buy does not do price matching, because a lot of companies
5615800	5620800	will do price matching, where if you can bring in an ad from a competitor, they'll match
5620800	5621800	the price.
5621800	5624800	And I would think the Best Buy ought to be able to match itself.
5624800	5629800	And a lot of times Best Buy does retarded, though, because I went in for a camera that
5629800	5634800	was marked down and priced a couple hundred dollars, and they said they didn't have it,
5634800	5639800	but they were retarded because it was actually last year's model that it was marked down.
5639800	5640800	They had it in a shelf.
5640800	5644800	They had to actually open up a cabinet to get this thing out.
5644800	5647800	So, it might be just retarded for an employee.
5647800	5651800	I don't even think that they say that it's an online-only sale.
5651800	5659800	I really don't think that it is an online-only sale, and I just think that's really too shady
5659800	5660800	for anything.
5660800	5661800	Is it shady?
5661800	5662800	Yes.
5662800	5663800	Is it illegal?
5663800	5664800	No.
5664800	5668800	So, there's really not a lot we can do about it but take our dollars elsewhere.
5668800	5675800	Yeah, and I'm also really excited about the gold testing in Naperville, because I'm really
5675800	5681800	hoping that means they'll bring it out here and that the arcade in Arizona will get gold,
5681800	5684800	because it seriously needs an upgrade from that.
5684800	5689800	You know, again, he's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold.
5689800	5693800	If you're a new listener to Orange Lounge, you don't know the Bimani music game scene.
5693800	5699800	He's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold, which is basically the 14th release for Japan, the
5699800	5702800	first one they're testing in the arcades here, although they did put the game out as Beatmania
5702800	5704800	on U.S. consoles a while ago.
5704800	5708800	Yeah, you know, I think the machine does insanely well, which it has the potential to do.
5708800	5712800	I think you're going to have a lot of people driving in to play the machine from nearby
5712800	5713800	areas.
5713800	5715800	I think you're going to start seeing this.
5715800	5717800	The only blockade is going to be the machine.
5717800	5720800	It's still going to be one of the more expensive ones to purchase, but I think you're going
5720800	5722800	to see arcades around the areas take the plunge.
5722800	5726800	I'm sure the golf land chain, which is big on the West Coast, especially California,
5726800	5728800	Arizona, I'm sure they'll take the plunge.
5728800	5730800	They usually do with Bimani games.
5730800	5732800	I really wish they do.
5732800	5738800	I think that's what they might have been working on while they wanted to work on Beatmania
5738800	5739800	U.S. 2.
5739800	5742800	I think they might have, maybe?
5742800	5745800	Maybe they said, what the hell are we doing two separate games for?
5745800	5747800	Let's just make it the same.
5747800	5749800	I say, it's about time.
5749800	5752800	Yeah, I do think it's about time.
5752800	5753800	All right.
5753800	5755800	Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for the call.
5755800	5756800	Take care, buddy.
5756800	5758800	We'll see you next time, all right?
5758800	5759800	All right.
5759800	5760800	Later.
5760800	5761800	Bye.
5761800	5764800	That was the NOS Cross, so they will bring the game to you very soon.
5764800	5766800	To all of us, because I would like to play 2DX Gold.
5766800	5767800	I don't know about you.
5767800	5770800	Lankystyle, you're a big fan of Beatmania 2DX, aren't you?
5770800	5771800	I used to be.
5771800	5774800	Did you hear about Beatmania 2DX Gold, testing over here in the U.S.?
5774800	5775800	Nope.
5775800	5776800	Oh.
5776800	5777800	What's that?
5777800	5778800	The 14th version.
5778800	5781800	Why did you stop playing Beatmania 2DX?
5781800	5783800	I've been doing other things.
5783800	5786800	Like, masturbating?
5786800	5787800	No.
5787800	5789800	Okay.
5789800	5790800	Like, writing a book?
5790800	5792800	Yes.
5792800	5794800	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
5794800	5795800	Whoa.
5795800	5799800	Hey, sorry to call in again, but I do have a couple of comments to make about games.
5799800	5802800	All right, well, Rob D., I suppose. As long as you're going to keep it on topic.
5802800	5806800	But no talking about amanjoys or I'll have to hang up.
5806800	5808800	I don't think you have to worry about that from me, but...
5808800	5809800	All right.
5809800	5818800	Okay, so, I don't know. You guys were talking about the Wii earlier and how it does have problems with games coming out
5818800	5820800	and the lack of games for it, for that matter.
5820800	5824800	I don't know. I think that all three consoles have trouble with games at this point.
5824800	5827800	Actually, yeah, they do all have trouble with games in some way, shape, or form.
5827800	5830800	The 360 has a lack of variety with its games.
5830800	5833800	If you're an RPG fan, if you're a fighting game fan, if you're a platformer fan,
5833800	5837800	I can't imagine you're too thrilled with the 360's game lineup.
5837800	5841800	True, and you just said Rice Princess right there, right?
5841800	5842800	Oh, my God, you're my hero.
5842800	5845800	This is why you have never been a big Microsoft fan, correct?
5845800	5846800	Pretty much, yeah.
5846800	5848800	Are you going to change your mind on 360 anytime soon?
5848800	5849800	No.
5849800	5850800	Not even Blue Dragon?
5850800	5851800	Nope.
5851800	5852800	All right. Sorry, Rob, did you keep going?
5852800	5854800	And then the Wii, obviously.
5854800	5856800	It just came out, but it does have some trouble with games right now.
5856800	5860800	I think a lot of third-party developers are unwilling to hop on the bandwagon
5860800	5866800	or were unwilling to hop on the bandwagon because of the odd nature of the controller,
5866800	5871800	and now I think by Christmas you'll see a lot more developers willing to give it a shot.
5871800	5873800	Do you think maybe it's just the time of year?
5873800	5875800	Because this is usually kind of a slow period for games.
5875800	5879800	We don't see a lot of big games start really hitting until summer.
5879800	5882800	Like come May, June, we'll start seeing more games in November.
5882800	5884800	Whoa, big flood of games.
5884800	5887800	Do you think maybe that's just part of it, why we feel a little bit robbed right now?
5887800	5888800	No pun intended.
5888800	5893800	Probably, but I think the E3 PowerPoint Expo in May will be very telling.
5893800	5895800	The PowerPoint Expo.
5895800	5900800	To see what people announce and see what people have for the Wii, the PS3, and the 360.
5900800	5909800	I'm hearing that the E3 Elitism Expo is actually supposed to be now possibly all the way to October.
5909800	5912800	Yeah, we'll see what happens with it. I honestly don't know that much about it yet.
5912800	5916800	And I call it the Elitism Expo because only the most elite of the gaming media
5916800	5920800	who has their mouths firmly on the cock of the various gaming companies out there
5920800	5921800	will get an invite to this.
5921800	5925800	And why didn't I get an invite?
5925800	5929800	I actually might be going to the Elitism Expo because...
5929800	5933800	Oh, really? Something you need to share with us here on the program.
5933800	5937800	Well, because distribution is in a whole different category.
5937800	5941800	Isn't it funny how no one's excited about E3 now?
5941800	5943800	Oh, fuck E3. Who gives a shit?
5943800	5945800	Well, there went our invite.
5945800	5948800	Well, it's no longer a rock star show like it used to be.
5948800	5953800	Actually, yeah, it's no longer a big show and rock star is never there anyway,
5953800	5955800	so we wouldn't see Grand Theft Auto.
5955800	5959800	Well, I meant rock stars and giant sound systems and that sort of thing.
5959800	5964800	Look, last year when I got diverted walking around the booth because of Paris Hilton,
5964800	5970800	I was pissed. I was so pissed. I was like, this show just makes me mad.
5970800	5972800	Although I did have a great time.
5972800	5974800	I did have a great time.
5974800	5976800	I did have a great time. It was really fun to play all the new games and talk about them,
5976800	5978800	but damn, Paris Hilton. I mean, man, fuck her.
5978800	5979800	She's everywhere.
5979800	5981800	Anything else, Rob?
5981800	5983800	I don't know. I think this Christmas is going to be very interesting.
5983800	5985800	I think the coming years are going to be very interesting
5985800	5989800	because the console race is really wide open this year, well, this generation.
5989800	5990800	What do you think?
5990800	5994800	The established leaders' problems are well documented.
5994800	5998800	Sony's got a lot of problems because they're trying to release a system
5998800	6004800	that's an all-in-one media center for $600 when all they want is a game machine.
6004800	6009800	We asked a lot of people in the program what the PS3 can do to get a bigger foot in the marketplace here
6009800	6013800	and get some of their love back from all these PS2 loyalists because they'll tell you,
6013800	6016800	I love my PlayStation 2, but I'm not so hot on the PlayStation 3.
6016800	6021800	I'm going to ask you, what will Sony do, you think?
6021800	6024800	I think we might see a price drop by this Christmas, honestly.
6024800	6026800	I don't know how they're going to survive otherwise.
6026800	6029800	I really don't. $600, $500.
6029800	6035800	It's a lot easier to convince kids' parents or even to convince 20- to 30-year-olds
6035800	6040800	or teenagers with jobs to get the 360, which is going to have a price drop.
6040800	6042800	You know that by this Christmas.
6042800	6043800	No question about that.
6043800	6045800	They're well overdue for one.
6045800	6047800	Or the Wii, which is $250.
6047800	6048800	You know what, though?
6048800	6052800	If worst comes to worst, though, you'll get your lame movie tie-in games that will sell like crazy.
6052800	6054800	Wasn't Cars the biggest selling game last year?
6054800	6055800	No.
6055800	6056800	Or something?
6056800	6057800	I don't know.
6057800	6058800	It was some lame movie tie-in game.
6058800	6061800	It was the highest selling game last year.
6061800	6065800	There was Madden. Madden's always the big one.
6065800	6070800	Movie tie-in stuff, I don't know.
6070800	6075800	Cars did okay, but it came out back in June.
6075800	6080800	Then the sales had already died by the time it came into Christmas.
6080800	6083800	Zappi says Cars was number three, Madden was number one.
6083800	6089800	I'm just saying, although there may not be a lot for us hardcore gamers,
6089800	6095800	the casual gamers and the kiddies, they do have a really big pull in this market we often neglect
6095800	6098800	when we're coming up with all these consensuses.
6098800	6104800	Yeah, but yeah, it is Sony, so who knows if they'll actually have that price drop.
6104800	6106800	We'll see. I hope so for their sake.
6106800	6108800	Because otherwise I don't know how they're going to...
6108800	6112800	Well, actually, again, the thing is we'll see where the Japanese developers go, too.
6112800	6116800	The ones that make the platformers, the RPGs, the fighting games, because they're not too high on Microsoft.
6116800	6118800	Well, at least they always have Ridge Racer.
6118800	6121800	Exactly. And the eye of judgment.
6121800	6124800	I know what they're going to do, Rob, to save themselves.
6124800	6129800	Sony's going to include a copy of Rainbow Island with the system.
6129800	6130800	That's a brilliant idea.
6130800	6131800	I know.
6131800	6132800	God, you should go work for Sony.
6132800	6133800	I shouldn't.
6133800	6135800	All right. Thank you, Rob, for the call.
6135800	6137800	All right, thanks for taking me again.
6137800	6138800	No problem. Have a good one.
6138800	6139800	I don't think you're showing anymore.
6139800	6140800	All right, no problem.
6140800	6141800	See you guys later.
6141800	6142800	Bye.
6142800	6147800	We just kind of hit the answer button on whoever's on deck, but unfortunately we got to call it a night.
6147800	6148800	We're running kind of long.
6148800	6151800	We took a bunch of calls in part A. We've had a lot of people on the show tonight.
6151800	6153800	Although we do appreciate all you guys calling in.
6153800	6154800	We're sorry to those digging through.
6154800	6157800	There were seriously like five people still hammering the line, so I'm so sorry to those of you guys.
6157800	6159800	We'll try to get you guys next week.
6159800	6160800	I'm sorry.
6160800	6163800	Do you want to do one real quick?
6163800	6165800	Yeah, sure, even though you just hung up on something.
6165800	6167800	Real, real, real freaking quick.
6167800	6168800	Okay, 60 seconds.
6168800	6169800	Orange House Radio, who's this?
6169800	6171800	Legend of Zaku.
6171800	6172800	All right, Zaku, get it out.
6172800	6181800	Just the fact that it's my understanding that the PS3 is just going to become that sinking ship, the Titanic.
6181800	6182800	Yes, it is.
6182800	6183800	As some would call it.
6183800	6185800	I'll never let go, Zaku.
6185800	6186800	I'll never let go.
6186800	6187800	Oh, please, yes.
6187800	6189800	All right, this will go on.
6189800	6201800	I'm just worried about, you know, honestly, you know, what I'm worried about right now is other games, you know, such as Crackdown, selling other things like, you know, for example, the Halo 3 Beta.
6201800	6213800	I mean, seeing that Crackdown is a really good game, I don't know if, you know, the Halo 3, all that hype might actually, you know, help the series in the long term.
6213800	6221800	Zaku, with the remaining 15 seconds, how can, I'll say, how can Sony get out of this mess minus the Final Fantasy 13?
6221800	6223800	Metal Gear Solid 4, does that depend?
6223800	6225800	Minus the two big ones.
6225800	6226800	Everybody knows about those.
6226800	6227800	Minus those two.
6227800	6231800	They need to get more downloadable content, more downloadable games.
6231800	6234800	Flow and Qbert, I think, are not cutting it right now.
6234800	6237800	So they need that and just, you know.
6237800	6239800	But what about Warlock?
6239800	6247800	Oh, yeah, that too, but you have to also consider that it needs to compete with the likes of the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console.
6247800	6250800	They need to get all their cards out just to be in the same footing.
6250800	6252800	You know what, they need achievement points.
6252800	6253800	That too.
6253800	6256800	All right, Zaku, got to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.
6256800	6257800	All right.
6257800	6258800	Later, buddy.
6258800	6259800	All right.
6259800	6260800	Bye.
6260800	6261800	That's it.
6261800	6262800	All right.
6262800	6263800	I just feel bad for this one.
6263800	6265800	Hi, who's this?
6265800	6266800	It's Ron Rowe.
6266800	6271800	You know, I'm still pissed that I was on a call coming up from a con while I missed an awesome show last week.
6271800	6272800	I'm sorry to hear that.
6272800	6273800	30 seconds.
6273800	6275800	Quick, con review.
6275800	6276800	Okay.
6276800	6277800	Con was great.
6277800	6282800	One of the guys in the chat, Mr. Wonderful, will be doing a complete con report for you guys in the chat by next week.
6282800	6288800	Also, to reiterate for Best Buy, yes, they do price next, but the trick is there's got to be a local store in the area.
6288800	6289800	How's that?
6289800	6290800	That's beautiful.
6290800	6291800	Thank you, Rama.
6291800	6292800	Later.
6292800	6294800	All our calls should be like that, seriously.
6294800	6295800	Wow, he's like-
6295800	6296800	Fucking in and out.
6296800	6297800	He knows the sound of it.
6297800	6298800	I know.
6298800	6299800	You just do that every time.
6299800	6300800	Like, get it out.
6300800	6301800	Beautiful.
6301800	6302800	Whip it out now.
6302800	6303800	30 seconds or die.
6303800	6304800	That'd be beautiful.
6304800	6305800	Okay.
6305800	6306800	All right.
6306800	6307800	I don't know what just happened there.
6307800	6313800	But I do know it's time to ask if there's any last minute stories.
6313800	6314800	Loki?
6314800	6316800	Loki has his hand out for a microphone.
6316800	6317800	Give me-
6317800	6318800	Anyways.
6318800	6321800	Yeah, there's going to be- I have some really small stuff.
6321800	6322800	Real quick.
6322800	6327800	Jasmine Toys announced Halo themed laser tag rifles.
6327800	6336800	So yeah, this Jasmine laser command line apparently is this brand that competes with the other laser tag rifles.
6336800	6337800	The other laser tag line out there.
6337800	6340800	You know, the cheap ass ones that you buy at KV Toys and stuff.
6340800	6342800	Laser cats.
6342800	6344800	Speaking of which, their minds-
6344800	6346800	Now that's what- God damn it, right there.
6346800	6348800	That's what the PlayStation 3 needs.
6348800	6349800	Laser cats.
6349800	6350800	Laser cats the game.
6350800	6351800	Show of hands.
6351800	6354800	If they put out laser cats the game on the PlayStation 3, who would buy?
6354800	6356800	All the hands in the room are up.
6356800	6357800	My feet are up too.
6357800	6358800	Oh my God.
6358800	6359800	There it is.
6359800	6362800	Dude, somebody put a phone call into Sony right now.
6362800	6364800	Dude, look up Sony's number.
6364800	6365800	Can we call them right now?
6365800	6367800	No.
6367800	6371800	And speaking of which, we need to go play laser- or play QZR soon.
6371800	6372800	Alright, fine.
6372800	6373800	QZR trip.
6373800	6376800	Dude, laser cats the game could save the PlayStation 3.
6376800	6377800	Oh my God.
6377800	6379800	I want a laser cat.
6379800	6380800	I really do.
6380800	6382800	Nobody knows what we're talking about, do they?
6382800	6384800	Oh my God, they totally should.
6384800	6386800	Paradox bits in chat.
6386800	6387800	Hands, feet.
6387800	6388800	SSJ 100 mat.
6388800	6391800	Laser cats over Thunder cats.
6391800	6393800	Act deaf says nope.
6393800	6394800	No.
6394800	6397800	No, they should just have a laser cat's cover for the Wiimote.
6397800	6398800	There you go.
6398800	6399800	Alright, sorry to interrupt.
6399800	6401800	Anyway, let's make one.
6401800	6402800	What's up on eBay?
6402800	6406800	Just like cut out a stuffed animal cat.
6406800	6409800	Just like take the stuffing out of a stuffed animal cat and like slide it over the Wiimote.
6409800	6410800	No, we're going to go further.
6410800	6415800	We're going to get an actual cat, you know, a taxidermist to make one.
6415800	6417800	Meow, meow, meow.
6417800	6419800	Hey Eddie, you forgot one thing.
6419800	6425800	I just started using laser cats again.
6425800	6427800	I love laser cats.
6427800	6428800	Oh, God.
6428800	6430800	We should be designing games.
6430800	6431800	And cats.
6431800	6436800	Let's quit the show and start orange lounge games, even though that Konami might sue us
6436800	6437800	over that.
6437800	6439800	We'll just start, you know, orange.
6439800	6440800	Tabby cat.
6440800	6444800	Or, I don't know, we'll start, you know, peach lounge games or something.
6444800	6445800	That's terrible.
6445800	6446800	How about sunrise?
6446800	6448800	Yeah, there you go, sunrise.
6448800	6449800	I don't know.
6449800	6450800	Tangerine.
6450800	6451800	Or Irene Mooney Me.
6451800	6452800	I don't know.
6452800	6453800	All right.
6453800	6454800	Okay.
6454800	6455800	Anything else, Loki?
6455800	6457800	That's about it.
6457800	6459800	All right.
6459800	6461800	We're dorks.
6461800	6463800	Gaming nerd says a samurai laser cats.
6463800	6465800	Samurai laser cats.
6465800	6469800	I used to watch that cartoon.
6469800	6471800	Joshi says orange soda lounge games.
6471800	6472800	There you go.
6472800	6473800	Orange crush lounge games.
6473800	6474800	Oh, my God.
6474800	6476800	That would be another copyright infringement.
6476800	6477800	I do it once.
6477800	6478800	All right.
6478800	6479800	Anyway.
6479800	6480800	I know.
6480800	6482800	Moving on, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
6482800	6485800	Rice Princess, thanks for being here and ruining the show with your dry wit.
6485800	6487800	As always, your final thought.
6487800	6488800	Dry wit, what?
6488800	6493800	Well, I was thinking of this very serious, poignant matter.
6493800	6496800	It's about time.
6496800	6498800	Yeah.
6498800	6502800	Eddie, your final thought.
6502800	6506800	Hot tubs are cool.
6506800	6507800	Pervert.
6507800	6510800	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
6510800	6512800	I hate people.
6512800	6513800	Loki, your final thought.
6513800	6514800	Oh, sorry.
6514800	6515800	Blue mittens.
6515800	6518800	Loki, your final thought.
6518800	6520800	Guess reject false icons.
6520800	6522800	Fuck the reject false icons.
6522800	6525800	Worship those false icons like never before.
6525800	6530800	Bow down to the golden cow.
6530800	6531800	Oh, my God.
6531800	6532800	Don't listen to the Moses scene, yeah.
6532800	6535800	I've got a golden calf, yeah.
6535800	6540800	My final thought is, am in joy.
6540800	6543800	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.
6543800	6545800	Please leave us a five-star retune on iTunes.
6545800	6547800	Please leave us a dig.
6547800	6548800	What do we have to do?
6548800	6551800	I will send Rice Princess over there to make love to you, if that's what it takes.
6551800	6552800	It's getting hot.
6552800	6556800	You should declare your love for Rice Princess in a five-star iTunes review.
6556800	6559800	Actually, I got a message from Speedy F40.
6559800	6563800	It says, tell Rice Princess that I still have a crush on her because she sounds like a freak.
6563800	6565800	Oh, that's kind of scary.
6565800	6567800	There's going to be a love triangle going on here.
6567800	6568800	Oh, my God.
6568800	6569800	With who?
6569800	6570800	All right.
6570800	6571800	With Stacia.
6571800	6572800	Do you like farting?
6572800	6573800	What?
6573800	6578800	Because you need to like that to be with Rice Princess.
6578800	6585800	Well, Rice Princess will choose who her heart belongs to based on who leaves the most five-star
6585800	6586800	iTunes reviews.
6586800	6587800	There you go.
6587800	6588800	Who sends me golden wow?
6588800	6589800	No.
6589800	6593800	In all seriousness, actually, remember what our new marketing director said.
6593800	6595800	Tell two people about Orange Lawns Radio.
6595800	6596800	That's all we ask.
6596800	6598800	Then, if those two people tell two more people.
6598800	6599800	Oh, my God.
6599800	6600800	Are you Ron Pupil?
6600800	6603800	Like, if you tell someone, we'll give you a free food night.
6603800	6605800	We'll throw in a free and enjoy A.
6605800	6608800	That's already been eaten because we eat them.
6608800	6611800	I'll autograph it and put it on eBay.
6611800	6612800	It'll sell for millions.
6612800	6613800	It'll sell for nothing.
6613800	6614800	All right.
6614800	6616800	We really need to end the show now, so cue the outgoing music, please.
6616800	6617800	Cue cue.
