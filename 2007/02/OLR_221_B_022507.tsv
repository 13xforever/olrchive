487	1368	Orange Lounge Radio
15436	19138	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19698	26182	And we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 221 for this February the 25th of 2007.
27082	28983	And we're here with part B of our podcast.
29003	32845	If it's your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you should dip back into our archives.
32925	34906	Visit www.orangeloungeradio.com.
35166	42930	You can hear the first half of this show where we talked about the virtual console and how Perrin Kaplan is always the introduction to the opposite sketch and much more.
42970	44971	We even took some calls, which is a rarity for part A.
45351	47432	So now we're going to get into part B, some more news.
47772	55316	DarkSakura is not here this week, but she'll be joining us for a tape segment in part B to do the mailbag, because we always welcome your emails at mailbag.orangelaunch.radio.com.
55356	56356	It is an interactive show.
56636	57617	It's not just about us.
57657	59578	I mean, we're just some schmoes on the internet like you.
60258	62339	We want to always welcome you guys to interact with the program.
62359	65381	We also have our chat room, hi chat room, waiting to interact with us.
65621	67542	Also in part B tonight, beat the host.
68322	70703	So Loki's looking forward to getting beat up a little bit.
71263	72944	If they choose me.
72984	73565	If they choose you.
73985	74445	Anyways.
75469	82473	So, apparently the rumor that Warhawk was going to be a download title is going to be true, I guess.
82733	95260	According to 1UP's Sam Kennedy, he apparently just recently was shown by Incognito the brand new Warhawk game, and it is going to be a download title.
95380	104405	And a quote from him, What Warhawk is apparently evolved into is a multiplayer-only title featuring ground-and-air combat that will be downloadable from the PlayStation Network.
104807	105267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
134981	135961	on the PlayStation Network.
136021	139863	Is it, you know, is it really this title's that weak that it can't be released retail?
140363	143905	Or is it just that, you know, the PlayStation Network doesn't have anything on it?
144025	145585	I mean, or a combination of the two.
146446	148187	Blaze doubts the truth behind this.
148467	151248	Blaze in the chatroom says 1UP is a tool of Satan, therefore they lie.
151968	156390	Very true, but, you know, I would take it if they're going and actually visiting the studio that...
157441	158441	You know, maybe this is the case.
158561	162363	But then again, you know, they haven't officially announced it yet, so I guess we could still call it rumor.
163343	163903	Would you buy this?
164263	164563	Nope.
164583	165003	Downloadable?
165203	166024	Not at all.
166204	166704	You know what, though?
166784	169025	I go, how much is it possibly going to be downloadable?
169065	169525	Maybe $25?
170145	172346	And then it would have been $60 as a retail title.
173166	177927	I'll have to see what the price is going to be on this, because I know one of the things that they're pushing is full downloadable games.
178427	183749	So if they're just going to test the waters with, you know, Warhawk, it better be good.
183769	186290	You know, I'll wait and hear the reviews on it, you know,
187148	190049	That'll determine whether I purchase it or not, because it's just like, you know, Q-Bert.
190129	194011	Q-Bert's a downloadable title, and just because it's downloadable doesn't mean I'm going to buy it.
194471	197373	I mean, it's crap, so I'll wait.
198013	201015	Misty in our chatroom says, aren't most game sites tools of Satan?
201315	201775	Yeah, that's true.
202075	214481	And actually, that gives me a chance to work in a plug for allgames.com, where our show is rebroadcast every week, Monday nights at 5.30, and, well, unless they run long, which they usually do, and Pacific Time and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
215506	218589	Allgames.com actually endorsed by Satan himself, actually.
218809	219689	So check it out.
220370	220630	Hot.
220690	221671	Yeah, that's hot, really.
221791	222992	Literally, whoa, yeah.
223412	223692	Alright.
224633	226775	Do you care about Warhawk and All Rise Princess?
226915	228556	I don't even know what the hell that is.
229056	230217	They had it on PlayStation 1.
230718	233420	It's like a biplane, like old shooting type game.
233720	235601	I mean, you're into bi.
236842	239404	It was done by the same people that did Twisted Metal.
239744	243427	And it was one of those kind of air combat games, but
245433	262324	It was one of the big things that they were showing off the 6-axis controller at E3, and I remember laughing my ass off when I saw the guy demoing it, and he barely landed this thing on the little landing pad, because the thing was practically falling off of the landing pad, because he just sucked balls at actually using this.
263305	264125	So that was kind of funny.
264145	269709	I would have loved to see him land it and the whole thing tip over and fall into the water, but alas...
270779	274483	Some other PlayStation 3 news for you guys.
274803	282730	If you guys have been kind of QQing over the fact that there's not a lot of, and I don't mean lining up, a lot of PlayStation 3 exclusives coming out.
283775	291580	What's interesting is that they are going to be getting some exclusives for Spider-Man 3, which I believe is a Sony picture movie, if I'm not mistaken.
291981	301768	And what's interesting about it is that Activision will be putting out a PlayStation 3 exclusive version of Spider-Man 3, but it's just the collector's edition that's exclusive.
302068	309314	The game itself will still be out on other platforms, but with the collector's edition exclusive to the PlayStation 3, you get some webisodes...
309824	311865	Special Spider-Man 3 trailers as well.
331400	334561	As well as you get to play as the second Green Goblin in the game.
334581	335561	There's going to be some missions.
335601	337622	Thank you for ruining the next part of the story.
337662	338623	Well, I thought you were done.
338683	339243	No, I was not done.
339263	339623	You paused.
339763	340803	You were a long pauser.
340903	341243	It's fine.
342364	342964	But I will say this.
343124	345485	It also interfaces with the 6-axis controller.
347926	349466	What, you don't care about Spider-Man 3, Eddie?
350247	353628	No, but does the PlayStation 3 version exclusively suck?
355268	355728	I don't know.
355788	357229	It's a little early to judge, but...
358402	358862	No, it's not.
387978	394921	Speaking of fucking over things, PlayStation 3 is going to be $1,000 in Australia.
395642	397542	That's Australian dollars, of course.
398063	400464	But that still equals up to $788 US or â‚¬599.
400504	401164	Yeah, that kind of sucks.
401184	401664	Holy crap, mate.
401784	403145	It's expensive.
403165	403625	Isn't it?
413362	418165	Apparently they say that it's the same price as the European PS3.
418785	425328	It's just because the current exchange rate and the small population size of Australia, they're just going to get fucked over.
425769	428090	Put another PlayStation 3 on the barbie.
428250	429110	You hear those clicks?
429170	432692	Those are all of our Australian listeners unsubscribing right there.
432812	433493	You know what, though?
434293	438235	The thing is, it may be more expensive, but you know what?
438255	439396	They're going to be including...
440598	441358	Casino Royale
469703	473307	Mel B says, PS3, Australian for Ripped Off.
474308	476290	Like the commercials for the beer, get it?
477291	481114	And then Ranma says, Crikes, Australia taking one up the arse.
482075	484577	You have the worst Australian accent.
484738	486579	I have the worst accent, period.
486800	487300	You do.
487360	491324	My Australia sounds like a Scottish guy and my British sounds like an Australian guy.
491989	493529	It all just kind of sounds the same.
493589	496690	It's like your t-shirt dude slash straight guy, whatever.
497210	498551	You just don't try very hard, do you, Rob?
498571	500991	Look, I'm not on this show because I'm funny, okay?
501111	501652	We know that.
501752	502812	I don't know why I'm on this program.
502852	503512	Yeah, we don't know either.
504252	504852	I really don't know.
505513	509274	Oh, I'm on this program to give release dates to you every week from Japan.
510334	515255	And, well, where there's being made fun of of the Australians, heck, why don't we just travel on over to Japan?
515295	516175	Let's make fun of them, too.
516715	518856	And their release dates for the upcoming week.
519758	525519	Coming out, let's see, on March 1st for the PlayStation 3, Gundam Musou.
525619	527300	God, is this the Gundam game we got here?
527600	529680	No, Gundam Musou is even better.
530260	531721	That's Mobile Suit Gundam, isn't it?
531941	534961	It's Mobile Suit Gundam mixed with Dynasty Warriors.
535401	536622	And there's a moose in it, too.
536682	545143	It's Dynasty Gundam, where you're fighting hundreds and hundreds of AI retarded... That's a pass, thank you.
545163	545423	Robots.
546264	548384	Let's see, what's coming out over on the Nintendo Wii?
549466	552548	Densha Dego Shinkansen EX Aku Daikan 3
578389	581290	I like this because this is the best cover I think I've ever seen.
581670	587471	Is it like you have these real people and there's this guy on the cover that's making this face like, Huh?
588232	588752	What do you want?
588852	590232	He's like, I farted.
590372	591272	You looking at me, bitch?
591753	593173	I don't know what the hell type of game this is.
593233	594613	It's a strategy game.
594653	597574	I'm going to post the link there in chatroom for those who want to see the cover of that game.
597614	599474	That's one of my favorite covers I've seen in a long time.
602415	602775	Let's see.
603575	605796	What else do we have coming out over in Japan?
606218	607438	on the Nintendo DS.
607859	608999	A handful of games coming out.
609359	612360	Super Robot Taisen W is coming out.
612981	614001	And let's see.
614521	616502	Ooh, Disney Meteos is almost out.
616542	617442	That's March 5th.
617462	618182	Disney Meteos?
618262	618943	Oh, that's the U.S.
619183	619923	Like Meteos?
619983	620323	Never mind.
620943	622104	March 5th in the U.S., sorry.
622904	623304	Coming soon.
623324	624605	Let's see if there's any other release dates.
624625	625245	That's all I got.
625405	626806	Not a big week for releases in Japan.
627246	627526	Darn.
628046	630987	I'm also doing Euro release dates tonight, though, because DarkSakura's not here.
631387	632188	So let me quickly get...
633944	637266	Let me geek them out getting out some release dates.
640028	640448	Let's see.
640508	644990	The Elder Scrolls on the PSP is slated for March 1st.
645731	648472	Also slated for March 1st, Legend of Zelda The Phantom Hourglass.
648492	649132	That doesn't sound right.
649172	650353	I thought that game got hella delayed.
651394	652514	You got hella delayed.
653115	654015	That's interesting.
654675	655196	What the hell?
655256	657057	These don't even sound like legitimate release dates.
657077	659378	They're talking about Resident Evil 5 on the Xbox 360?
659438	659758	What?
659938	660619	No.
660839	662920	I think there's just some placeholders on this calendar here.
664023	665725	I would believe this though, Yu-Gi-Oh!
665785	667986	GX coming out on the second for the PSP.
668047	668987	That certainly seems legit.
669007	670128	Still no one cares.
670449	672770	Sonic and the Secret Rings for the Wii also on the second.
673311	673831	There you have it.
674052	674932	Awesome.
675232	679676	Wait, speaking of Resident Evil, is that on your agenda tonight?
680537	680977	I don't think so.
680997	683860	The Resident Evil 3 trailer came out for the movie?
683900	686121	No, it definitely was not on the agenda tonight.
686302	688043	Oh, well, the trailer's out.
688343	688503	And?
688664	689404	So go watch it.
689424	690985	It's called Resident Evil Extinction.
691326	692687	It actually doesn't show a lot.
693382	695123	Actdeft says Resident Evil 3 was filmed in my city.
723875	726236	Do you live in Raccoon City?
727317	728417	Are there a lot of raccoons?
728857	729878	Okay, yeah, so that's it.
730338	731738	That's all I wanted to say.
732479	735100	Let's get some definite for sure release dates, Loki.
736921	738281	Nothing's ever definite for sure.
738321	739622	I shouldn't try and fill in for Jamie.
739682	740162	I just shouldn't.
741129	744831	Let's see, some exclusive stuff real quick, and this isn't all that great.
744851	747272	I mean, it's already been announced, Command & Conquer 3 for the 360.
747652	751794	It is coming out now, though, May 9th, so that's kind of cool.
751874	753655	Definitely need some more real-time strategy stuff.
754416	756757	This one's kind of interesting, but not too exciting.
757157	767702	Backyard Football 08, and this is one of those franchises, it's the only kid franchise for sports games, and it is coming to the Wii and PlayStation 2.
768749	771270	So, but that's all the way in September 27th.
772351	776813	But, you know, definitely a budget Atari title that they keep putting out each year.
777573	779954	Ryoma says Backyard Football is the best ever.
780835	781675	Okay, well, there you go.
781875	782575	The best ever.
783296	784016	I'll stick with that.
784656	787398	Anyways, this week, though, we've got some good stuff coming out.
788118	792000	On the 360, we have Bullet Witch, which is going to be pretty awesome.
792340	797002	And, you know, if you're definitely looking for some scantily clad witches fighting demons...
797449	798109	Oh, perfect.
798609	803691	And I do believe that there is a download where you can get a schoolgirl outfit for her, so that's awesome.
804712	809854	Also on the 360, Dance Dance Revolution Universe finally making its way out, and I'm picking this up.
809894	810954	I can't wait to try it out.
811394	817416	Of course, I'm not going to be able to use a dance pad, but, you know, upstairs apartment and all.
818277	820138	Samurai Warriors 2 Empires.
820618	821418	I'm buying it anyway.
821758	822518	Listeners can deal.
822558	826520	If I have to hear them practicing guitar or piano or whatever the hell they have down there, they're going to hear me playing DDR.
827062	827642	Samurai Warriors 2 Empires
853158	855619	Um, 07, the show's also coming out on PlayStation 2.
856539	862480	On the Wii, we've got SSX Blur, which, you know, SSX is an awesome snowboarding game, so definitely check that out.
862900	865561	PlayStation 3, you've got Formula 1 Championship Edition.
865581	868242	If you're a racing fan, you might like that.
868742	874603	On the PSP, Chili Con Carnage, uh, which is, I believe, Total Overdose on the PSP now.
875363	881665	And, uh, 300 March to Glory, uh, PSP game based on the upcoming Frank Miller movie and comic.
882445	882565	Um,
883539	888523	Finally, also on the PC, we've got Jade Empire Special Edition, which looks pretty cool.
889604	893247	Also, Sims 2 Seasons, expansion pack for Sims 2.
895048	898151	And I do believe that is it.
900853	903375	Oh, I think Luminous Plus might be coming.
903435	904476	No, I think that already came out.
905037	905437	Can't remember.
905517	906598	That's moved around so many times.
907256	909557	I think it did, because DMM mentioned it when he called in earlier.
909917	913599	Yeah, but I think stores got it early, so they might have broken street on it.
914239	914859	I'm almost positive.
914879	916400	I saw it at a GameStop like two months ago.
916880	919021	But as much as I love Luminous, I'm not buying it again.
919261	920502	I have it on PSP twice.
920522	921042	I have it on 360.
921362	922683	I don't need it again.
924544	925364	Really, I don't.
925544	926064	It's a good game.
926124	928545	It's good, but it's not, you know, freaking buy it four times good.
928886	933427	Then, of course, you know, on Virtual Console, though, you've got, you know, what is it, Ocarina of Time coming out?
933928	936709	So, you know, if you want to purchase a game...
937216	939918	Virtually, you can go ahead and do that.
940279	944442	Yeah, because I don't already have the GameCube disc and the version.
944842	946163	How many times have they released that game?
947344	947765	Too many.
950167	950427	All right.
951128	957253	Anyhow, speaking of buying things, one of the places very popular for folks to buy games at is Circuit City.
957573	963558	Well, what's interesting about this is that Circuit City is testing a new program online and at select stores today.
964385	967107	They are now dabbling in used game sales.
967547	970409	So it looks like they want to start competing with places like GameStop.
971270	975192	Of course, this means games are usually selling about $5 cheaper than they usually do.
975613	979795	The prices, it appears, according to reports, are about the same that you would see at a GameStop.
980896	982417	But of course, Circuit City wants a piece of that.
982637	985799	A billion dollar market, apparently, that GameStop EB Games has.
986260	988761	I think a little competition for GameStop would be a healthy thing.
989162	990422	So I totally support this.
990703	992724	Although I have to admit, I don't usually shop at Circuit City.
993191	995232	But maybe that's part of it.
995333	998875	Another reason they want to do this is maybe they'd like to get their foot in the door a little more with games.
999075	1000796	So I welcome the price competition.
1001597	1006981	I don't think GameStop could buy Circuit City very easily like they did EB Games and whatever else they've been buying lately.
1007021	1008882	So I think this will be a good thing.
1010043	1020150	Yeah, it is a good thing as long as they don't kind of go along the same lines of their ads and coupons policy, which means that, well, for example, there was a situation that happened.
1020840	1028062	Last month, Circuit City had a flyer that ran an ad which promised to save you up to $40 when you buy your Wii with them.
1028823	1033584	It says, as long as you visited the website, printed the flyer, went to the shop, they give you the discount.
1034325	1036385	Later on, though, they said they'd take it all back.
1036405	1044168	They said the discount actually comes with a statement, qualifying purchases excluding gaming hardware, and took the coupon off the site completely.
1044708	1047209	But apparently people went to the store and...
1048899	1050821	wanted the discount and they couldn't get it.
1051381	1055444	And then of course they complained to the Better Business Bureau and so on and so forth.
1055804	1063509	And the response was apparently the Better Business Bureau received a ton of responses for it.
1064249	1075136	One of the things they basically got from Circuit City was that they reserved the right to make changes to advertisements and coupons, etc.
1075176	1075256	at
1076733	1077333	Whatever they want.
1077514	1082817	So, you know, where they can print out, you can have a coupon for, you know, $40 off of a system or something.
1083718	1085619	They can go ahead and bait and switch.
1086279	1088741	Huge comments from chat room on these two topics.
1089321	1091983	Joshi16 says, Circuit City will give up, me thinks.
1092423	1094685	ShadowCharlie says, Circuit City, they can go fuck themselves.
1095265	1097607	DDRDollarBill says, Circuit City will fall soon.
1098283	1101785	Blaze says, competition for GameStop is important because there's little competition out there.
1102285	1104506	James Patrick says, GameStop killed EB Games.
1104586	1105386	I hate them for that.
1106107	1108828	HitStun says, I'm starting to really miss Funkoland.
1108848	1110649	And that made a lot of people go, Funkoland!
1110729	1111589	Funkoland was awesome.
1111849	1114330	The way you say it's funny, like Funkoland.
1115291	1116251	Funkland.
1116411	1117452	Exactly, like it's so funky.
1117472	1118772	It's got a lot of funk to it.
1118792	1119533	Funkoland.
1120113	1120393	All right.
1120553	1120853	Yeah.
1121614	1125956	Well, we have some other stuff coming up in this segment, including Beat the Host.
1125976	1126456	Beat the Host.
1127131	1130253	And of course we need to find a worthy competitor to play Beat the Host tonight.
1130613	1137876	So if you want to guess some arcade retro classics here with us, we're going to be asking a question here very soon.
1138957	1140658	But we have a couple more stories for you first.
1142378	1144900	And that is this one, which I think is very interesting.
1145560	1148061	Apparently Digg is trying to trademark its name.
1148081	1151523	You know Digg.com, D-I-G-G.com, they're trying to trademark their name.
1151963	1156345	And let me work in a cheap plug, if you would, Orange Lingerieo is on Digg.
1157012	1161593	And we used to be on the first page, but WC Radio really kicked our butt.
1161653	1161953	Thanks.
1162333	1163253	Thanks for that, Speedy.
1163854	1164334	No, just kidding.
1164354	1167534	But a lot of shows are kicking our butt there on Digg, including the CorpCasts.
1168735	1169395	So we need help.
1170175	1174136	So if you would like to dig our show, head on over to Digg.com, click on Podcasts, search Warren's Lounge, you'll find us.
1174236	1174716	Give us a dig.
1175116	1176416	I'm sure somebody will post a link in chat.
1176676	1178337	We could also use reviews on iTunes.
1178657	1181797	And I'll tell you what, we actually had two people post reviews last week.
1181817	1183858	So OLR is the Festering Rash of Internet Radio.
1184338	1184698	Awesome.
1185197	1185597	Awesome work.
1185617	1187338	And then Uni made a more serious review.
1187758	1188578	Awesome work, people.
1188698	1189779	I'm so proud of the OL Army.
1189919	1191559	So we definitely need more DIGs and more reviews.
1191880	1194541	Anyhow, so you know DIG, the social networking site.
1194761	1195281	Well, get this.
1196241	1200563	Apparently, LucasArts is trying to interfere with this trademark.
1200623	1211267	They have actually put in an injunction or whatever, filed an opposition, shall we say, because they had a game in 1995 called The DIG.
1212067	1214368	And because DIG has a gaming page...
1215091	1218293	and you have this game called The Dig LucasArts says is too confusing.
1218433	1219314	But, what?
1219634	1221755	It's not even spelled the same way or anything.
1221855	1224197	Like, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
1224917	1225698	That is terrible.
1225978	1226398	It's pretty bad.
1226438	1227659	Apparently it is spelled the same way.
1228239	1228900	Is it The Dig?
1228920	1228960	No.
1229420	1232102	Because this is D-I-G-G and The Dig is just like a dig.
1232362	1234584	Well, I forgot that The Dig even existed.
1234724	1235144	Me too.
1236145	1236985	How could you forget?
1237065	1238346	It was such a good game.
1238366	1240227	I don't know.
1240407	1241128	That's stupid.
1241808	1242729	Stupid LucasArts.
1242949	1244470	It's all George Lucas' fault.
1245933	1250676	Because he makes crappy fixes to his Star Wars movies.
1251097	1256700	Anyways, so speaking of putting the blame on others.
1257501	1258662	Wait, I have to say this.
1259342	1261784	Speedy in chat says, Dig Dug should sue.
1263165	1263525	That's true.
1263845	1266607	If the Dig can sue, why can't Dig Dug?
1266767	1268348	Why doesn't Dig Dug sue the Dig?
1268368	1271270	Because when you dig stories, don't you say, dug it?
1271330	1272551	Like it says, hey, you dug it.
1272611	1273492	Hey man, I dug it.
1273552	1275293	You know what, Namco, get on that.
1276448	1284056	I think, um, like, grave robbers and those guys should sue people too.
1286058	1286878	That's it.
1286938	1288100	Sorry, that was stupid.
1289061	1290642	Now I'm really sorry I interrupted Loki.
1290702	1291023	I know.
1291183	1300472	Anyways, a Seattle, Washington, um, news station and, unfortunately, you know, they're retarded, but, um,
1301380	1309607	KOMO TV, they reported on the sexual predators that are on Xbox Live.
1309667	1314391	And they're blaming Xbox Live for, you know, apparently people.
1314751	1321757	Remember this whole story with, you know, the kid getting kidnapped and, you know, they apparently had some pictures on live or something like that.
1322267	1328752	Anyways, they're documenting this 13-year-old boy playing Gears of War, which, okay, that right there is a mature-rated game.
1329213	1331515	Parents obviously not paying attention to what this kid is doing.
1332816	1334958	Thank you, by the way, case in point.
1335138	1338741	I think this makes the whole story a piece of shit, right there.
1339241	1343925	That they taped a 13-year-old playing Gears of War when it says clearly right there on the label, it's a mature game.
1344666	1351131	Anyways, though, but it says, a parent is helpless to do anything, and a grown man playing the Lolia character...
1352295	1353735	for Game Points.
1355276	1359256	And then that basically went on to talk a little bit about... It's all sensationalism, basically.
1360076	1373399	But they were also talking about how there's no way that the parents have to be online or with their kids, I guess, or something, in order for the parental blocking to work or something.
1374159	1381100	Either way, it was one of those stories done by a local station for ratings that obviously had no facts whatsoever.
1381852	1382713	regarding the subject.
1382793	1385776	And of course, everybody jumps on it like, you know, creepy.
1385796	1386356	Hey, baby.
1386376	1391281	Why don't you come over here and I'll show you the size of my Xbox Live points card.
1391421	1392021	Oh, yeah.
1393523	1395004	That was terrible, Rob.
1395664	1396886	And so is this story.
1397386	1397826	I know.
1397926	1399068	Whoa, don't yell at me.
1399728	1400629	I concur with you.
1400669	1402390	This has to be... I have to laugh at this.
1402451	1404512	This is also... They have a picture from...
1405894	1413337	Fancy Star Universe, which it says right here, it says 500 for pics, 1,000 for nude cam show.
1415218	1416299	Oh, my God.
1416319	1419540	Dark Tattooian chat says, want to see my gamer score?
1419560	1421541	Oh, gosh.
1421861	1426604	It says people are from Ohio, Kansas, and I'm from Washington.
1426644	1429525	You can just talk to each other really clear.
1429585	1431606	I've met other people as far away as Russia.
1432287	1434208	And then it says the parents are talking about it.
1434228	1435329	And we're really concerned.
1435389	1438550	Our problem is parents don't see this as a threat yet.
1439811	1441692	Of course, they're not paying attention to what their kid's doing.
1442453	1444714	Anyways, you've got to check out the article.
1444794	1445474	It's hilarious.
1445714	1453459	ComoTV.com slash news slash 5983826.html Or just probably just search on the website and you'll find it.
1453579	1456300	Online Gaming World is a Forum for Sex Predators.
1456360	1458001	That's the story article.
1458061	1459262	But it's funny.
1459864	1464587	Hey Rob, you want to come over and see my huge stiff boner?
1468070	1473113	Actually, coming from a woman, I kind of would like to see how you're going to pull that off.
1473333	1479497	Okay, $500 for pics, $1,000 for live webcam action, whatever the fuck it's in.
1480598	1481779	Okay, here's another one right here.
1481799	1486562	They're talking about, apparently this kid Adam, I think this is the 13 year old that they're talking about.
1486582	1488884	His mother, Karen Epstein...
1491256	1496258	She does not know about the blocking features on Xbox Live.
1496738	1504600	When she opened Adam's online account, she handed him over the setup so that he can do all the setup stuff for the account.
1504620	1515544	Okay, well apparently this parent is just stupid because she's handing over this stuff to her kid and letting him get in basically all this trouble and stuff.
1515604	1519325	And to be honest, I mean, if you're really that concerned about your kid...
1520246	1527792	And to be honest, I don't think she even knows that there's a threat out there with this stuff until the news person says, Did you know your kid could get raped from Xbox Live?
1527812	1530895	And then she's like, Whoa, what the fuck?
1531916	1538421	And related news, according to that one news story we talked about a couple months ago, PictoChat is raping children everywhere.
1538561	1539281	Did you hear about this?
1540002	1540202	Ew.
1540322	1540643	Horrible.
1540663	1543605	I'm going to start using PictoChat now.
1545767	1547268	Ross Princess is horny.
1547668	1548389	Whatever.
1549130	1550631	You can't rape the willing rice princess.
1550851	1551452	This is true.
1552313	1553113	Hey little boys.
1553133	1555635	No, just kidding.
1555695	1556596	Wash my brain.
1556656	1557336	Never be clean.
1560459	1561300	Here it is, kids.
1561380	1562340	Tonight's question.
1563001	1567624	And the first one to send this in a private message to me in the chat room gets to play Beat the Host tonight.
1568045	1571527	And you have to be willing to use Skype or call our 800 number to be a part of the game.
1572308	1575471	Now, tonight's topic is classic gaming, right?
1576271	1577152	So the question is,
1577935	1579977	If you're a classic gaming expert, this should be no problem for you.
1580477	1583079	On what board number does Pac-Man crash?
1583519	1585481	That is, on what board number does Pac-Man crash?
1585561	1585961	There you go.
1586622	1590224	I posted it on the chat room, so if you know your classic games, you know what I'm talking about.
1590785	1591225	So there it is.
1592186	1601413	All right, meanwhile, controversial stories like our last one always generate a lot of emails, and we always get a lot of good emails to our mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1601792	1607619	and through the magic of the space-time continuum, DarkSakura is here tonight to read us our emails.
1607699	1608300	Hi, Jamie.
1614728	1620636	Yo, this is the voice from beyond who isn't here because of family business.
1621466	1628667	Um, here is the, uh, mailbag, and the first email comes from some guy- And thank God I'm here, too, to interrupt you.
1629087	1632268	Because it just wouldn't be a mailbag segment if I couldn't talk too damn much.
1633088	1633908	Rob, I hate your Mac.
1635409	1636809	Hey, bring your own laptop next time.
1636849	1637689	B-Y-O-L.
1637949	1640689	Hey, I was gonna give you a free massage, so, fight me.
1640889	1641710	Massage my butt.
1642890	1644910	No, I'm not into the glute massage, sorry.
1644930	1645950	Massage my middle finger.
1646610	1646871	Right there.
1646911	1647931	I massaged Christopher's.
1648291	1648791	Did you?
1648851	1649071	Yes.
1649131	1649351	Alright.
1650001	1650921	Good to be here.
1680655	1681676	DarkSakura's Obsession with Collection
1703698	1708820	and Loki's tech news, even when he gets so angry he fumbles his words, lol.
1709360	1712702	But I don't have the time and patience to sift through the nonsense to get the info I need.
1712722	1714142	He didn't say he unsubscribed.
1715043	1716163	I thought I said he unsubscribed.
1716203	1717544	No, but patience.
1718539	1719019	DarkSakura.com
1736209	1737290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1766078	1772201	Yeah, I'm a firm believer in family values, as in I believe in the value of... Never mind.
1772782	1773762	Sorry, you're getting off topic.
1773782	1774983	We need to talk more about games.
1775783	1776664	Is this about a video game?
1776744	1777684	Is your grandpa a video game?
1777704	1778265	I don't think he is.
1778425	1779245	He's not migrant.
1779545	1781646	All right, you say your piece, I'll say mine.
1781666	1782427	Okay, anyway.
1783267	1785628	I think, yeah, to a degree it's gotten a little bit crazy.
1785829	1789030	But, you know, those are like how the shows used to be back in the day.
1789250	1792552	And I think it's kind of fun to let loose and be kind of silly once in a while.
1792972	1793513	Because really...
1795342	1818378	Ratings state other than what you just said However, I like to keep it a bit more in line Finding the balance is kind of hard Sometimes you do have to let loose and be a little bit silly Everybody needs a change A little break Change is good for you Maybe you need to be silly more often
1819076	1824560	You're one of those people who, it seems to me, that your energy is rooted in your root chakra, which is the first one.
1824660	1825620	Oh, Jesus Christ.
1825760	1826381	All right, look, look.
1826441	1827461	I want to say my piece.
1827702	1829002	You know, I agree with what you're saying.
1829263	1837788	It's about balance, and the trick is that we have to find the right balance on this program between, you know, too crazy and too, you know, too much hardcore games.
1837808	1841070	Because honestly, you know, there's like 300 video game podcasts out there.
1841110	1848515	You know, granted, just because we were one of the first ones out there doesn't mean that, you know, people will automatically, you know, tune into us because we were one of the first.
1848800	1854782	We have to compete with 300 podcasts, everything from other independent podcasts to corporate podcasts.
1854842	1857623	Although I don't see the other independent podcasts really as competitions.
1857663	1866327	I actually want to say thank you to the emailer in a strange way because the other podcast he says he's going to go listen to instead are at least both independent podcasts that are just fine shows.
1866647	1868047	But there wasn't an instead there.
1868947	1869428	Well, whatever.
1869568	1869848	Anyway.
1870488	1872769	So regardless, but it's interesting because â€“
1873388	1878289	For me, I know I've listened to one of those shows before, and they kind of have an off-topic-ness of their own.
1878329	1879150	That's not a bad thing.
1879470	1881650	I think you have to have a personal touch.
1881690	1883671	That's what makes all these shows unique.
1883731	1885692	So, you know, we're still trying to find the balance in a way.
1886012	1888332	Yeah, I was a little crazy the past couple weeks, but, you know, it was fun.
1888412	1891913	I think what makes me happy about this one, though, is that he cared enough to tell us.
1892653	1892994	That's true.
1893454	1897875	And, I mean, that to me just seems like is, you know, hey, I want you guys to do better, you know.
1898524	1901445	So, I mean, if that's the case, that's sort of the vibe I was getting.
1901565	1903146	So, I hope that's the case.
1903166	1904246	Dude, I hope you're still listening.
1904506	1905667	I'm sorry for picking on you.
1905687	1907588	I pick on everybody out of love.
1908948	1912249	But, you know, honestly, that helps us do better.
1912390	1917472	So, if you stick with us, keep giving us that chance, you know, you'll...
1919674	1922936	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1950177	1951078	I'll be eating cake.
1952120	1952580	Well, have fun.
1952620	1953381	Bring me back some cake.
1953441	1954122	Is it ice cream cake?
1954583	1955003	I don't know.
1955083	1956044	It's for Grandfather.
1956064	1956845	Cake the video game?
1957806	1958387	Cake the band?
1958607	1959428	So, next email.
1959509	1960390	Yes, next email.
1960630	1961551	From AZHP.
1962512	1962973	Hey, guys.
1963694	1964014	Hey.
1964314	1964775	I'm not a dude.
1965766	1966387	PS3 Price Drop
1987649	1989530	Now, do you guys think this is a wise decision?
1989990	1993311	Would they make more money by keeping the same price but having a cheaper cost of production?
1993811	1998073	Or would they benefit from having a larger install base with a price cut to get more software sales?
1999013	2003535	It just feels like Sony of America doesn't even know what Sony Japan is doing or thinking.
2003795	2004755	They're all just winging it.
2005356	2008437	I love the PS2, even though I'm on my third one because they keep breaking.
2008837	2013159	But they just keep doing the wrong thing at the wrong time with the PS3 and PSP.
2013179	2013959	What's going on?
2016400	2016720	You know...
2018185	2020506	I would rather pay more for a quality product.
2021046	2022206	That's my thought.
2022226	2025787	That's actually sort of why I like my first generation Japanese PS2.
2026227	2033989	Because even though they had parts that wore out a little bit faster, they were a little bit better made in terms of their sturdiness.
2037270	2038110	It's business.
2038490	2042811	They're always wanting to make things cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and not change the price.
2042931	2044731	They want to make it transparent to the buyer.
2045132	2046672	You're not going to know the difference.
2047574	2048114	www.DarkSakura.com
2075325	2076046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2090737	2095060	So, you know, granted, Sony doesn't want to keep taking such a big hit, so they do want to cut corners.
2095341	2096382	But again, it's about a balance.
2096442	2106990	If they can maybe save $100 on a system, pass along $50 of that savings to me, at least it'll be the illusion of, hey, the price is falling, even though they're going to actually gain a little more money, if that makes sense.
2107591	2123864	Well, and I hate to keep comparing things to my massage therapy, but it's actually a lot of what they talk about in the business aspect of that is that when you're trying to get clients in, and in this case comparing it would be new buyers, you make like an introductory price.
2123924	2130810	You make like a special, you know, get your PS3 at the sale date, you know, maybe like a corporate sponsored sale.
2131390	2133612	They get a bajillion buyers, you know what I mean.
2133692	2135414	They get more people purchasing it.
2136034	2137395	and then have it be at the regular price.
2137415	2139136	They can say, oh, well, this is a good product.
2139176	2140496	It's really worthwhile for you to buy it.
2140897	2142177	And then other people will come back.
2142377	2144218	And that's, you know, I think, how you do it.
2144879	2145159	All right.
2146119	2147000	I hope you're listening, Sony.
2148200	2149581	Sony never listens to us.
2149641	2150902	Kasarai just needs a massage.
2151962	2153523	He needs Jamie to touch his chakra.
2153983	2154783	Not by me.
2155544	2156004	I'm sorry.
2156024	2157745	There's people I... Give him a happy ending.
2158946	2159286	Rob.
2159486	2159766	Heart.
2162227	2163768	Okay, this one comes from Twist.
2163788	2163888	Twist.
2164912	2166292	I think Twist is a new writer, too.
2166993	2167593	Hi, Twist.
2168213	2169173	I think that you're awesome.
2170074	2171194	Anyway, hey, OLR.
2171214	2172575	A few things I want to write about today.
2172675	2174115	First off, I was at GameStop today.
2174255	2174975	I'm so sorry.
2175516	2177236	And there were two Sony men there.
2177776	2178797	Sony, big capital letters.
2179677	2182458	I guess they were just checking on their PS3 demo setup or something.
2182478	2188460	The assistant manager there, a friend of mine, was talking to one of them and asked when the US will see any white PSPs.
2188820	2190561	The man explained it probably wouldn't happen.
2190981	2193862	They watched Nintendo sell their multicolored systems and learned a little from it.
2195109	2198251	Owning every colored system seems to be a trend in Japan and not America.
2198992	2207158	Also, if a white PSP were to be released and someone who wanted a white PSP went to a store to buy one and they only had black ones available, they would leave the store and not buy any PSP.
2207558	2210420	They would therefore be losing out on a PSP sale.
2210761	2212502	Those were the excuses he gave.
2213643	2214603	And instantly the sex stopped.
2214623	2215064	She later explained...
2242566	2244328	She used to hate video games.
2244648	2252695	She would get mad at her little brother all the time when they were younger and her father would chase him off the TV when he would be playing.
2253215	2254396	So why the sudden interest, I asked.
2254416	2259921	She figured out that she hated them maybe because her brother never let her play and no one ever taught her.
2259981	2266846	So I thought maybe every girl is a potential gamer but can't express it because of game-hugging brothers.
2267907	2269889	I don't know, I used to just kick my brothers off and play myself.
2270772	2273813	Last thing, Evolution Fighting Game Tournament, evo2k.com.
2273833	2274633	You guys should check it out.
2274673	2275533	It's a great experience.
2275993	2278493	People here take fighting games to a whole other level.
2278893	2280674	You guys have the Bimani community.
2280754	2282514	I have the fighting game community, lol.
2283514	2283954	That's all.
2284014	2284474	Love the show.
2284494	2284854	Keep it up.
2284894	2286855	No matter how off-topic the show goes, it's always great.
2288375	2292336	You know, the fighting game community, they're some pretty hardcore people.
2292516	2295416	You know, I don't follow that scene a whole lot because I suck at fighting games.
2295936	2298197	But, yeah, it's pretty hardcore there.
2298237	2299837	I like Smash Brothers, though, but I suck at it.
2300296	2302538	There's just a funny story.
2303699	2308103	There's a guy who's well known in the cosplay community now named Chris, Chris Tang.
2309964	2321074	A long time ago when we first met him, he worked for Capcom and brought his own joystick over to our house and proceeded to be on like a level five difficulty while Dan was at like a one difficulty.
2321654	2326939	And Dan actually beat him around and he said that that was the most fun he's ever had playing because someone actually managed to beat him.
2328823	2330503	So losing once in a while isn't so bad.
2331764	2342806	If you beat everybody that's around you, then... That's why I kind of... You know, I love fighting games, but there are people who get way too into it, who get too good for the game to be enjoyable, I think.
2342966	2345766	Have I told my Street Fighter II chick story on this air once?
2346547	2353588	One time I was in L.A., and I was on, like, a trip, and it was when I was younger, probably about 17, and we were at a comic book shop late one night.
2353608	2355968	It was, like, after closing, but for some reason a bunch of people were still there.
2356228	2358689	There were all these hardcore Street Fighter II people playing,
2359048	2363270	And I walked in, I didn't know much about the game, and I was playing Chun-Li, and I kicked all their asses.
2363470	2363790	I did.
2364350	2369233	But the thing is, is that I probably beat like eight of them in a row, and they were getting pissed, like, who is this guy, what the hell is he doing?
2369473	2375295	You know, it was probably because I was doing some new, I was some new blood, and they all knew each other's techniques, probably.
2375635	2376396	So they kicked my ass.
2376716	2378276	Well, finally, you know when I went down?
2378817	2383039	When some girl walked in, and she also picked Chun-Li, she schooled me.
2383719	2383879	So...
2385151	2386271	Julia, who on Tekken... Julia and Jin both have...
2414864	2416545	Moves that block throws.
2417405	2427791	And so I was just using them over and over again and managed to piss them off so badly that they left all of their credits in the machine and left.
2427851	2429712	And I, of course, took advantage of it.
2430272	2432013	I'm not going to let any credits go to waste.
2432874	2433254	Very nice.
2433774	2434735	I love being a girl gamer.
2434755	2436916	I think we completely got off topic of that email, but oh well.
2437056	2438097	That's what happens when you email us.
2438917	2441298	This one comes from Radink.
2441678	2442559	I guess that's how it's pronounced.
2442932	2444113	Hey OLR, love the show.
2444233	2446674	I was curious as to what the closing song of the show was.
2447914	2450035	It is iFuturelist by Kiri Yamaoka.
2451136	2451796	Oh my god.
2451816	2453617	Fame producer of the Silent Hill series.
2453637	2455238	Uber email.
2455918	2457159	Okay, this is from McFloyd.
2458620	2459360	This is a great email.
2460140	2465402	Dear OLR Crew, I haven't emailed in a while, so I thought it was about time I did.
2465462	2467603	Speaking of emailing, whatever happened to the letter of the week?
2467944	2470585	Did it just phase out because I haven't heard one being announced for a while?
2470925	2475867	The only reason I think about it is because my first email was the letter of the week, and I was ecstatic about it, and I haven't heard much since then.
2477068	2477508	You know what?
2478448	2483050	It's been... Okay, I know this is hardly an excuse, but I have been horrendously busy.
2483390	2485671	Well, also, just we haven't gotten a lot of Uber emails lately.
2486212	2486752	Yours is it.
2486972	2487752	Congratulations.
2487772	2488813	You're a second-time winner.
2489862	2491224	We don't get a lot of Uber emails.
2491244	2499371	I think the idea behind the Letter of the Week was for the Uber emails that were just too long to read on air, we would have them just be the Letter of the Week and everybody could go read them on their own time.
2500212	2502574	But we haven't gotten a lot of those lately.
2503075	2503695	You know what?
2504176	2504776	This one's it.
2505897	2508840	It's the longest email we've received by default you win.
2509421	2510462	But actually, it's a really good email.
2510622	2511362	I'm going to finish reading it.
2511683	2511823	Okay.
2512233	2515356	and finding more and more that graphics really do affect what I think of a system.
2515797	2522843	I love my Xbox 360 because it has games like Gears of War and I'm very excited about the effects in Halo 3 from what I've been reading on the Benji website.
2523204	2528369	Although I don't know if I'll be buying a PS3, it still really impresses me as everything looks so realistic.
2528909	2547664	If Sony made some better decisions and the price went down a bit, I might even consider getting the PS3, mainly because it has the processing power to make major games perform well and possibly to make the dashboard, or whatever it's called on the PS3, very sleek, easy to navigate, and a simple place to put music, pictures, movies, etc.
2548125	2553369	In a few years, I would see the PS3 and Xbox 360 as good game consoles, but I'm worried about the Wii.
2554025	2561331	It doesn't have the power to play games that will make people gasp in admiration, or the space right off the bat to store large amounts of information.
2561651	2568737	It has the graphics of a game generation that was supposed to last five years, and it's supposed to last for a generation that could be even longer.
2569078	2577384	The controller is innovative, there's no doubt, but games like Katamari Damacy pulled off innovation with regular PS2 controller and peripherals can always be made.
2577805	2582749	Software like the Wii channels can very easily be copied by Sony or Microsoft.
2583969	2588712	So why haven't they done it?
2590813	2593934	I think, again, it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.
2594314	2596255	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
2596956	2606840	And on the Wii, you have Wii Sports, Zelda Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, and on the PlayStation 3, you have Mobile Suit Gundam, Sonic the Hedgehog.
2607461	2610042	Granted, you have Resistance, but Resistance...
2610643	2613005	Is Resistance $600 plus $60?
2613986	2616468	No, okay, let me give PS3 benefits out.
2616488	2621932	$500 plus $60 plus, you know, whatever the component cable costs to make the game look good.
2622212	2622913	Is it worth that?
2623073	2623673	Is it that good?
2624634	2625114	I say no.
2626035	2627056	For the average gamer, no.
2627833	2634775	But whereas the Wii, you know, again, the Wii is going towards a different audience than you, the hardcore gamer.
2635035	2637856	They're accomplishing their goal very beautifully, I think.
2638236	2639777	Honestly, I know a lot of people.
2639857	2641898	I mean, look, we have Marissa in here last week.
2642238	2647439	We've had, you know, I've had other people I know that don't really play a lot of games or haven't played a lot since 8-Bit Nintendo.
2647459	2648440	Grandparents are playing the Wii.
2648800	2655082	Yeah, you know, just even outside the grandparents, because I think a lot of the, like, you know, anti-Nintendo crowd says, like, oh,
2655458	2659101	Well, a grandma may play Wii bowling, but does that mean she goes out and buys a Wii?
2660222	2663765	I don't know, but that means that grandma's going to think about that for her kids.
2663885	2675395	Actually, I was at Target a couple of days ago and saw this lady probably in her early 60s buying a Wii, and we were in line together.
2676236	2678517	So I asked her, I was like, so this is for your grandkids?
2678537	2679158	She's like, no, it's for me.
2680759	2683201	You know, I don't want to come off sounding like a Nintendo fanboy.
2683261	2683762	To be fair...
2684289	2686330	Sony, you know, has the potential.
2686351	2686611	You're right.
2686631	2687151	This guy's right.
2687671	2689453	The system's got a lot of processing power.
2689753	2691154	It's got a lot of potential.
2692034	2693735	But at the same time, so does the Wii.
2693775	2696156	We know Nintendo always keeps secrets about systems.
2696196	2697396	They don't show off till later.
2697916	2700697	The Wii really, truly has not gone online yet.
2701077	2703398	I think they will, despite the whole friend code thing.
2703458	2711241	I just have this feeling that, you know, once you really sit down and play Animal Crossing with Wii Connect 24, it's going to be a different type of experience all its own.
2711261	2716623	But in the meantime, I still think Microsoft will always be the king of gaming, online gaming in this case.
2716703	2717323	But I don't know.
2717383	2717743	We'll see.
2717803	2718024	We'll see.
2718064	2718724	It's just too early.
2718864	2719084	I mean...
2719577	2722718	Wake me up when Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII are out.
2722798	2724798	Then I can really assess the PlayStation 3.
2725098	2729079	But right now, it's a pretty box with nothing inside it.
2730939	2731520	That's how I feel.
2732320	2733880	Actually, mine's dusty now.
2734460	2737941	I mean, if I were to show... It's a shiny, dusty collector.
2738181	2744382	If I were to show my mom Resistance, she might go, well, it's nice looking.
2744842	2747163	But if I were to show my mom Wii Sports, she'd go...
2747856	2748076	and so on.
2762540	2764280	There's one other issue that's been bothering me.
2764340	2765581	The way people rate games.
2765621	2774785	I find it disturbing, and this doesn't just relate to video games, that sex is as much a bigger deal than violence for the ratings as it's a much worse thing.
2775105	2790793	For those who really understand what violence does, I suppose it's okay that violence is so prominent in video games, but when little kids grew up seeing in movies and games that violence is not such a big deal and sex is awkward or wrong, or when people do it, they're somehow breaking the rules, it definitely sets them on the wrong path for looking at life.
2791348	2795612	I think that as long as games and shows are separated from reality, it's okay.
2795952	2803319	But when kids are becoming saturated with these ideas coming from them from all directions, it's hard for parents to give them the right information when the media controls their kids' minds.
2803779	2813328	My point with all this is that you have to give the parents a break because entertainment, video games included, is affecting children, and there will always be friends with systems to play or TVs to watch.
2813728	2815410	Even parents try their hardest to stop it.
2815450	2817732	That would require an impossible amount of patience and strength.
2817992	2819393	Yeah, I can see it from that angle.
2819433	2819953	I do understand that.
2819993	2822214	But I think that it's just a matter of... Actually, you phrased it beautifully.
2822714	2825915	Parents don't often have the courage to teach their children about life early on.
2848705	2856899	I think that if they started off educating their children, that would avoid a lot of the problems.
2856959	2861287	Make sure that if their child's going to see something that
2861949	2863230	It's not a big deal to her.
2863310	2863610	It's just like
2889426	2890407	www.DarkSakura.com
2916511	2918974	because their logic â€“ they're not fully developed.
2918994	2920315	Their logic is not all there.
2920835	2928603	If you say, hey, this happens, this is what goes on, they're going to be in a better position to assimilate what they're seeing.
2929064	2932027	It's very interesting you bring up that point because I kind of â€“ one other little thing.
2932187	2935610	I don't know if I was maybe mishearing or misreading into this letter, but I'm also hearing that this is â€“
2937608	2943252	The society and the parents have a way bigger problem with sex and games than they do with violence and games.
2943512	2945414	And that's just American culture in general.
2945714	2947475	I mean, you're not just talking about video games there.
2947995	2949096	It is movies.
2949196	2950057	It is TV.
2950217	2953539	Sex is always looked at way harsher than violence.
2953980	2963166	I mean, seriously, a movie says the F word twice and it gets rated R. But, you know, you can blow up limbs and heads and, you know, sometimes you can still get away with a PG-13.
2963886	2967349	Yet we have this real problem with underage sex in this country.
2967836	2968497	Interesting, hmm?
2968777	2973401	I don't know, you kind of apply what you're saying there, and when it's taboo, people want to do it.
2975083	2981409	I bet if mom and dad talked more about them having sex in front of the kids, kids would never want to have sex, ever.
2981489	2983451	I'm joking, I'm not a parent, I don't know.
2984171	2990978	Just something that, more information that I've taken from my classes, one of my teachers said that, um,
2992657	2993357	DarkSakura.com
3017580	3020442	Adrenaline into your liver, which is shortening your lifespan in general.
3020663	3021683	You're not breathing properly.
3021723	3027308	But also, you know, there's this whole attitude that sex is something that you don't discuss.
3027408	3030951	It's something that you keep hidden, where it's offensive.
3031011	3033093	I'm willing to discuss sex on this program anytime.
3033893	3039958	Well, and you know, and there's some people who are, who don't need it so much.
3040659	3041940	You know, I'm not gonna.
3042841	3045463	There's some people I know that do need it, because, you know, oh boy.
3046672	3053657	It really, but it is, I think, you know, it is, I think, an important part of your overall well-being.
3053697	3054938	It's a balance that it creates.
3054998	3072249	And when we treat it like it's a disease, when we treat it like it's something that's disgusting, that's foul and immoral, you really take something that's very healthy for you and treat it, it's like having the cure for cancer.
3074028	3076669	and thinking that it's, and treating it illegal.
3077349	3079610	All the emails have this balance theme going on tonight.
3079990	3080990	I fully believe in balance.
3081010	3081750	I think it's a good thing.
3081810	3089653	But, you know, it's just that whole, that's, you know, I hate to go off on the tangent like that, but that's my view toward how America views sex.
3089673	3100696	Because if you go to a lot of other countries where people just, you know, go around topless or, you know, where nudity is on TV and no one treats it like a big deal, look at their rate of sex crimes, you know.
3101309	3102550	I'm going to start a trend right here.
3102590	3104451	I'm going to go around topless in studio right now.
3104492	3105232	You know what, Rob?
3106953	3107494	I can't.
3107734	3120824	But it's, you know, if you take a look at it, we have such a high rate of sex crime because I think it's because we do treat it like it's a disease.
3120964	3122645	Well, your thoughts are always welcomed out there.
3122665	3124767	I'm sorry for going off on it.
3124827	3126188	But, you know, it's...
3127531	3136860	It's actually something that's been sort of sitting on my head for a while because I really noticed it, you know, and video games are just another symptom of it, you know, the whole hot coffee thing is like, dude, why?
3136960	3139502	It's got an M rating anyway, didn't it?
3140157	3140677	I believe so.
3140998	3141658	Yeah, so.
3141718	3144400	But they said it should have been AO, but that's R versus NC-17.
3144420	3144840	But anyway.
3144860	3145281	Whatever.
3145401	3146741	So the last phrase here.
3147042	3148263	And by the way, Loki got pwned.
3148683	3153966	He was so confident about the Halo 3 release in spring, yet on the Bungie website, a picture had the ad campaign came out.
3154407	3156828	And at the bottom, Fall 2007 was written boldly and clearly.
3157329	3159130	I guess no one's perfect, but he was still wrong.
3159230	3159810	Okay, that's all.
3159830	3160010	Bye.
3160251	3162192	Listen to last week, part A. I called him on it.
3163097	3163478	P.S.
3163518	3165799	He has some good reasoning, though, so take a listen.
3165979	3166299	P.S.
3166360	3173524	Since the Wii is 7th generation and the Xbox 360 is 2nd generation for Microsoft, the term for Wii and 360 owner should actually be Wii 69.
3176006	3177967	I'm not sure how that math came about, but all right.
3178588	3178788	Okay.
3178968	3179368	We'll take it.
3179689	3181129	We have one from Lee.
3181970	3182330	Hi, Lee.
3182490	3183871	Who is apparently writing us from London.
3185352	3185913	Well, hello.
3187394	3188274	Hiya, guys.
3188575	3190596	Would you like to sit down and have some tea and crumpets?
3192813	3197255	I got an email complimenting me on the British accent, by the way, to my personal email box.
3197655	3197915	Really?
3198235	3198455	Yes.
3198676	3199796	I haven't done mine on here, have I?
3200336	3201557	I don't know.
3201637	3204238	We're running long.
3204578	3212802	One thing I really like about being from Alabama, if you look up, the southern accent is actually derived from... Balance, Jamie, balance.
3212822	3213742	Hey, I'm going to talk about it.
3214102	3220925	The southern accent is actually derived from the West England type region of accent.
3221306	3222226	Did you read that on Wikipedia?
3222246	3222326	Yeah.
3223323	3223944	No, I didn't.
3224264	3226466	I actually took a linguistics class.
3226526	3228908	But you can find it on Wikipedia, though.
3229889	3230950	Anyway, back to the email.
3231651	3232272	Hiya, guys.
3232312	3234193	Just wanted to comment on your marketing strategy.
3234634	3239979	Rob suggested at the end of your last show that all listeners go out and let one person know about OLR.
3240359	3244623	I think this may be an unnecessarily slow process and hamper your efforts at world media domination.
3245204	3248187	If my math is correct, and it most likely isn't,
3248686	3249046	Lee, Lee, Lee
3275675	3278578	Lee is the new marketing manager of Orange Lounge Radio.
3278638	3279678	I like the way you think, Lee.
3279699	3280419	Welcome aboard, Lee.
3280439	3281200	Welcome aboard.
3282301	3283322	Send me a plane ticket, please.
3283742	3285944	I like the way this man thinks.
3286024	3291428	Therefore, at the end of the show, from now on, I will be encouraging everyone to tell two people.
3291869	3295612	Now they have to tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio, and you can all thank Lee for that.
3297954	3298775	I like the way he thinks.
3298835	3299495	That was brilliant.
3300696	3303779	Last email, which is going to segment...
3304758	3305339	Play my music, Rob!
3305359	3305599	Good morning!
3323607	3327448	One of my friends, another listener, linked me to this site a few days ago, and I thought it was cute.
3327488	3330269	Perhaps it could be a website of the week or something of the sort.
3330930	3332730	It at least deserves an honorable mention.
3332990	3333550	Objection!
3334091	3335711	Which we have discussed on the site before.
3335731	3339752	I have seen previous user-made objections, so this is good.
3339873	3341373	It's about time we named this the site of the week.
3341613	3344494	However, yeah, you're right, it's about time.
3344554	3347155	So it's objection.mrdictionary.net.php
3351728	3355590	And we actually have one submitted in this email.
3356691	3358673	So you actually had an objection put in the email?
3359133	3363276	Yep, and it's loading the text right now.
3366158	3369581	Clearly, DarkSakura should choose objection as the website of the week.
3370241	3373924	Evidence shows that it is 99% amazing.
3376606	3378848	I'd like to know what type of evidence that is, but all right.
3379639	3380099	We'll take it.
3380280	3381901	That sounds like one of my live demo entries too.
3384003	3387946	Anyway, that'll do it for both the website of the week and for emails.
3387986	3388807	Keep them coming, y'all.
3389027	3389347	All right.
3389508	3396614	Any closing words you want to say to the listeners at home, DarkSakura, before we vanish you into what's current and live on the show right now?
3396874	3398896	I didn't say what I was playing this week.
3399356	3399596	All right.
3399616	3401098	Well, quickly tell us about your gaming week.
3401118	3401978	I played World of Warcraft.
3402499	3402639	Yeah?
3402659	3402739	Yeah.
3402932	3405793	Thanks to my dear best friend, Chris.
3406554	3407714	I am playing again.
3407734	3414977	I don't have Burning Crusade yet because, well, I have to pay $300 at the end of March and $500 to buy a massage table in April, so I'm kind of broke.
3416378	3419399	However, I played my first human.
3419700	3421920	I played a warlock, and I hate kobolds.
3422401	3423241	What server are you on?
3423961	3425982	Raven... Ravencrest?
3426222	3427123	Oh, the server we all play.
3427163	3427503	Wait a minute.
3427623	3428904	I was trying to say Ravenloft.
3428984	3430504	Wait, Ravencrest, but you're a human.
3430905	3431105	Yes.
3431225	3431945	What's your character's name?
3432864	3433744	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3455256	3456957	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3483829	3489011	and Misty has sent us 20,000 emails from her phone.
3491192	3494673	So you can email like Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio on your phone?
3494753	3495454	I can do that too.
3495514	3496074	Interesting.
3496434	3497134	But I like this one.
3497194	3498575	Hey, I miss you guys a lot.
3499575	3502416	I'm just going to go ahead and get a brand new computer once my tax money gets here.
3502436	3503057	Misty's funny.
3503097	3505578	She sends me a lot of random AOL messages too, but it's cool.
3506318	3507999	They make me chuckle.
3508019	3508879	Dude, it's the doctor!
3510552	3513313	On that note, we better go back to the present time.
3513333	3514273	So quickly, your final thought.
3517534	3529657	Anybody in the Sacramento, Roseville, Citrus Heights area, in April I will be a licensed massage therapist and my rates are $75 an hour for me to come to your house and give you the best massage ever.
3529817	3534459	Is this the Orange San Diego video game show or the massage show?
3534479	3535499	Because I'm starting to wonder.
3536159	3537720	Will you massage people while they play video games?
3539100	3539220	Maybe.
3539260	3539360	Maybe.
3540024	3540444	DarkSakura.com
3568556	3569417	Did you hear about this, Eddie?
3569517	3569837	I don't know.
3569877	3575821	Did you see the list that GamesRadar posted of the five game characters with one foot in the closet?
3576522	3577843	I did not, but I'd love to hear it.
3577863	3578803	You might want to turn on that mic.
3580464	3581725	I did not, but I'd love to hear it.
3581805	3586348	Well, I don't know if I want to really read the whole list, but basically it was a bit of a controversial article.
3586609	3594994	They said Kratos from God of War, Marcus Fenix from Gears of War, Frank West from Dead Rising, and Vaan from Final Fantasy XII.
3595255	3595715	That's true.
3596195	3597176	But you know what's interesting?
3597518	3602162	What's interesting is kind of the way they went about saying it is they used a lot of gay stereotypes.
3602702	3609607	You know, like, so-and-so is, you know, cross-dresses, so he must be gay, because he looks like a chick, so he must be gay.
3610768	3611629	That's stupid.
3611729	3612249	That's pretty dumb.
3612469	3617193	And what's interesting is it caught the radar of Gay.com, which is not a gaming site, it's a gay site.
3617393	3621496	It caught the radar of Gay.com's UK edition, as well as another site, PinkNews.com.
3621940	3625903	and they publicly yelled at these GamesRadar article.
3626383	3629465	Pink News said, quote, What is the point of outing characters?
3629766	3632968	Is this yet another bunch of childish straight boys laughing at gay people?
3633829	3643856	And the author of the gay.com article was elaborating that the article had a very facetious tone to it and basically was making jokes about the LGBT community.
3644736	3651021	And I guess because they pegged Frank West as being gay because he dresses up in women's clothes and children's clothes.
3651325	3658271	Yeah, I mean, gamer guys are... Not the ones that listen to this show!
3658371	3659993	Yeah, I can see that, where they'd be kind of homophobic.
3676781	3678142	They make hot guys, too.
3678502	3680863	Have you never played any of the Castlevania games?
3680883	3682264	Where the hell have you been?
3682524	3683464	What is that one game that came out?
3683524	3685125	God Hand?
3685565	3688066	That game is pretty ripping on gay people.
3688706	3690047	I haven't seen this game.
3690287	3691788	God Hand is for PS2.
3692348	3697670	The game looks pretty good, but it's pretty over-the-top porn for 14-year-old straight guys.
3698011	3701012	You can spank, but only the female characters.
3701032	3703333	There's these really flaming gay villains.
3704926	3709428	The whole game is supposed to be a parody on Kung Fu games or whatever.
3709568	3711689	It's like Kung Fu Hustle the game.
3711829	3713010	That's basically what it's supposed to be.
3713970	3716891	Yeah, but in every trailer they show the spank attack.
3717111	3719172	But you could only spank the female villains.
3719192	3721093	They didn't program it, so you could just spank anyone.
3721533	3723374	So I don't know, that's pretty one-sided to me.
3724515	3724935	Interesting.
3725515	3728756	I don't know, I read the original list that GamesRadar posted.
3728816	3729777	I just thought it was stupid.
3730353	3730593	Okay, dude.
3730613	3730733	Right.
3759016	3759977	Sure, dude.
3760497	3761699	Dude.
3761759	3762599	Yeah, sure, dude.
3762680	3764561	The guy from Gears of War is totally gay.
3764701	3765302	Yeah, you got it.
3765702	3765963	What?
3766003	3769446	Yeah, because he's thinking about his buddies too much and all that.
3770167	3776593	And Kratos is totally gay because he doesn't bang two chicks at the same time in two different games.
3776973	3777213	Uh-huh.
3777594	3779335	And he doesn't wipe his ass with tree bark.
3779455	3779676	I mean...
3781129	3782871	Where was Makoto on the list?
3783372	3784493	That's the reason I didn't take the list.
3785134	3791823	I guess maybe because it was about closeted game characters, whereas Makoto in Enchanted Arms was a... Where is the king of the cosmos?
3794474	3795574	Or Seymour.
3795714	3799915	Or where is King, the biggest lesbian in all of video games?
3799955	3801716	Oh my god, she's totally a lesbian.
3802196	3804637	Yeah, I'm kind of with you though, Skye.
3804697	3805517	I don't really care.
3805537	3806657	Yeah, I don't really care.
3806717	3812418	I mean, whoa, you know, it's like, I just, you know, I want there to be a game where you spank guys.
3812478	3815059	You like Sims-type games where you can just do whatever you want.
3815959	3816519	Yeah, pretty much.
3816619	3819080	Yeah, as long as they let me do stuff to guys in the games.
3821400	3821720	You're gay.
3821740	3822882	Only willing ones, of course.
3822902	3824264	Yeah, well, yeah, no, yeah, of course.
3824324	3824944	I mean, geez.
3826567	3827087	Come on now.
3827307	3827568	Uh-huh.
3827808	3828449	Come on.
3829070	3829710	Gays are gay.
3831773	3832214	Uh, let's see.
3832274	3835297	James Patrick says, God Hand, the main character is gay, right?
3835377	3836018	Or becomes gay.
3836058	3837660	That's what the X-Play video seemed to suggest.
3837780	3837961	Yeah.
3838461	3838902	Of course, that's
3839366	3846630	A lot of things, a lot of X-Play videos suggest gay themes for games and... Yeah, that's, that's kind of what this article struck me as.
3846710	3848031	It was like an X-Play review.
3848111	3851353	Like, it's trying, like, way too hard to be funny, but I just don't laugh.
3853073	3853594	That's what it is.
3854254	3854534	Yep.
3855395	3855655	Alright.
3856355	3856795	So that's it.
3856836	3858456	I don't have my feathers ruffled over it.
3858476	3861598	I just kind of go, GamesRadar's wearing enough egg on their face over it.
3861698	3862999	I don't need to be all senior.
3863039	3864580	Oh, it's homophobic and blah blah blah.
3864920	3865460	No, it wasn't.
3865720	3866301	It was just stupid.
3866621	3867161	There's a difference.
3867281	3868862	There's a difference between homophobia and stupidity.
3869011	3870652	Nobody really cares about you guys.
3871852	3880375	So every month it seems to be that there's a story out there about somebody killing somebody and somehow they're tying it into violent video games.
3880415	3883956	And that was the case also with a Milwaukee murder.
3883976	3890058	15-year-old Nathan Moore was a murderer of Rex Baum, an alcoholic transient.
3890718	3897360	And apparently Nathan Moore was quoted saying it was just like a violent video game.
3898124	3900246	Killing the guy reminded him of a violent video game.
3900946	3904909	So of course everyone went, ah, it's games to blame and stuff like that.
3905249	3917597	Well, the stepmom of Nathan actually was a dedicated Penny Arcade reader, and she actually wrote him a letter regarding the whole thing.
3917998	3927144	And it's actually quite interesting because they talk about how the kid is just kind of just crazy, getting in trouble in every which way, and
3927771	3934615	No, it doesn't... She basically points out it's not the game... Not video game's fault, and it did not make him who he was.
3934975	3944201	He was already fucked up to begin with, so... I do think it's kind of interesting that at least there's someone out there that's willing to say, Hey, this is not the case.
3945882	3951145	And I believe someone pointed out... I can't remember where it was, but they pointed out that, you know...
3951670	3954052	He may be crazy, but he's not stupid.
3954132	3962839	He knows that he can get some sort of crazy insanity plea with saying that, oh, video games made me do it type of thing.
3962939	3967623	So I think he's just trying to use that to get off a little bit.
3968824	3969564	I don't know.
3969584	3970004	To get off?
3970085	3970305	Ew.
3970965	3972687	To get off from being you.
3972767	3975549	I love we can always count on the serious perspective from Rice Princess.
3975569	3976770	Do you have any serious thoughts on this?
3977330	3977670	Yeah.
3980433	3980813	That was it.
3982830	3983210	I farted.
3984792	3986613	Everybody say goodbye to Rice Princess, folks.
3986633	3987954	She won't be back last week.
3987974	3989335	Shut your face.
3989835	3990976	Anybody have any comments on that?
3992037	3992277	I do.
3994919	3996300	Moving right along then.
3996320	3997521	You guys are assholes.
3998962	4005167	Microsoft has been caught in a lawsuit and a federal jury ordered Microsoft to pay $1.5 billion dollars
4006105	4015954	to the telecom group Alcatel Lucent for violating two patents related to digital music.
4015994	4020738	Basically, it all has to do with MP3 encoding and decoding, and that has to do with Windows Media Player.
4020758	4022899	You might be going, what the hell does this have to do with gaming?
4023400	4034049	Well, it's because a part of this suit has to do with speech coding and video coding used in the Xbox 360, which makes you go, hmm, will future Microsoft's products be hampered by this?
4034693	4039314	Or is this just a case of a jury wanting to get back at Microsoft because they're evil or whatever it is?
4039654	4041075	I think that they're just going to pay this.
4041375	4050117	And unlike Sony, they're actually going to pay for the rights or whatever that they may have infringed on and just license them.
4051198	4053458	I think they do that actually for the Rumble technology.
4053498	4055979	They license the Rumbling patents or whatever.
4057119	4061640	Although some companies decide to remove them altogether because they don't want to shell out money.
4063061	4063501	But whatever.
4064682	4083490	So, um, you know, on a completely different topic though, um, you gotta love the Russians, and they came up with this wonderful, you know, and this is like such a horrible stereotype, but, um, they've come up with a Russian, a massively multiplayer online drinking game.
4084490	4085351	Oh my god, that's awesome!
4086151	4087852	And apparently it's, um,
4089292	4094116	You would take this special shot glass that would plug into your computer via USB.
4094757	4101002	And when you logged into a special chat room, the glass keeps track of how much alcohol you have left, just to make sure that you're keeping up.
4105085	4108648	What if I put water in it?
4108848	4109229	Ha!
4109369	4110389	I fooled the computer!
4111711	4113452	Well, aren't you Elite Hacker?
4114933	4116494	I hacksword your shot glass.
4117295	4117996	With water...
4118795	4121376	Or can't you just, like, pour it out into another cup?
4121536	4125117	Or, you know, like, there's tons of different ways you could hack into it.
4125137	4126977	I'll give it all to Irene, because she's poor and can't afford it.
4126997	4127338	Yeah, I'll take it.
4127358	4130919	Well, couldn't you just go on one of those adult sites and put up a picture of somebody else?
4130999	4139341	I mean, that's about the same thing as... Or can't you just, like, drink at home, like, with your friends, and not have to do it on the computer with a bunch of people you don't know?
4139621	4141562	Like, that's pretty sad.
4141602	4146163	This sounds, to be honest, this sounds like something that they would have in, like, Second Life.
4147229	4151853	KaneVM says, in our chatroom again, chat.orangealternative.com, KaneVM says, MMO drinking?
4151893	4152413	Hell yeah!
4152914	4154575	Blackboy says, that game sounds awesome.
4155436	4157638	Blaze says, innocent people will die over this game.
4157758	4160660	And GS68 says, you'll die of water intoxication.
4160700	4162261	That's true, I do live in Sacramento.
4163142	4165203	And apparently people like to do that here.
4165644	4166144	Oh god.
4167577	4167877	What?
4167937	4168578	It's true!
4168678	4169339	Don't give me the too soon.
4169359	4169879	Too soon, too soon.
4169919	4170900	Don't give me that.
4171021	4178889	Okay, yeah, you know all those people that made those comments were like, under 21, and like, oh my god, it's so cool, a drinking game.
4179069	4188839	I don't think Black Boy, when Black Boy participates in, I know they call it Free Play Friday, but I call it Drunken Orgy over at All Games on Fridays, so I think he's over 21.
4188939	4190460	Oh man, they have Drunken Orgies?
4192120	4193581	We've got to pick up the slack here.
4193601	4194421	Mississippi Orgies.
4194701	4195102	Oh, I'm sorry.
4195882	4198204	Oh, it is the end of February sweeps.
4198224	4200406	How are we going to top that on the All Games Network?
4200446	4202888	We're going to murder someone live on air.
4202948	4203688	I know.
4203728	4204389	Bye, Rob.
4204509	4206290	And you wondered why LankyStyle came back.
4206410	4210514	All right, LankyStyle, just put this plastic bag on your head, and I've got a rubber band.
4211074	4212175	Too soon, too soon.
4212215	4212795	I love you.
4213136	4214297	Hearts to you.
4214317	4216798	He's really acknowledging me.
4217139	4218720	I know how we can pull through the sweeps.
4223303	4225264	Oh man, our ratings are number one.
4225685	4227706	So anyway, let's go back.
4227906	4231869	Alright, well no, I know exactly how we can pull through for sweeps.
4232489	4233590	Are you okay, LankyStyle?
4233670	4234210	I didn't mean it.
4234670	4236472	What, an apology to LankyStyle?
4236612	4236972	Yeah.
4236992	4238693	He's giving me pouting face.
4238753	4240894	It's like unsubscribe, unsubscribe right there.
4241035	4241355	Alright.
4242435	4242776	Anyway.
4242796	4243876	Don't misrepresent me.
4244137	4244417	What?
4245057	4245958	I said don't misrepresent me.
4245978	4247319	At least I finally got you to talk.
4247359	4247659	Fuck.
4248159	4248559	Alright.
4249060	4249820	You're mean now, Rob.
4249960	4250841	I know, I'm a jerk.
4250881	4251261	Alright.
4252262	4252542	Alright.
4253359	4255180	Let's see, I'm looking at chat room.
4255941	4259404	Blackboy says, did anyone see the photo of me teabagging stalker Oscar?
4259664	4261285	See, look, we're going to lose sweeps, you guys.
4261305	4262206	We're going to fucking lose.
4262746	4263146	Oh, man.
4263166	4263667	Against this.
4264047	4265068	Come on, teabagging?
4265308	4268690	That's it, I'm going to have to go and teabag Rice Princess right now.
4268710	4270031	Get the hell away from me.
4270071	4271332	He's really walking towards me.
4271352	4274835	Bend over.
4274875	4274995	Ah!
4275075	4275215	Ah!
4275235	4275556	No!
4275616	4276536	How much do I owe you?
4276576	4279959	All right, anyway, we've got to go to our next segment, which is a great sweeps trick.
4279999	4282881	It's playing a good old-fashioned game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4283206	4291328	And we have a game called Beat the Host And we asked a qualifier question earlier in chat And that was, which board does Pac-Man crash on?
4291728	4294989	And we have our winner on the line Hi, you're on Orange House Radio, you there?
4295550	4296190	Hey, how's it going?
4296290	4297190	Hey, who is this?
4297690	4300551	It's the Rob D Rob D, what board does Pac-Man crash on?
4301171	4310614	256 That's right, the 256 board is when half of it glitches But apparently, you can actually still get past it But you have to be superhuman
4311394	4320021	Basically, if you memorize everything, it supposedly is possible, and there is a way to hack the ROM and get around that and make it normal, I think, but I don't know.
4320061	4322843	That's according to Wikipedia, so I don't know too much about it.
4322923	4323503	All right, good job.
4323523	4324905	You and I got the answer from the same place.
4324965	4325285	All right.
4326105	4327967	I do have a question to ask you before we get into this.
4328027	4328567	All right, why not?
4329368	4330529	Why are you dodging us and hold them?
4332056	4334358	I was out Saturday night.
4334399	4334659	I'm sorry.
4334679	4335680	I'm not trying to dodge you guys.
4335940	4339583	But Saturday night is a busy night, especially when I work during the week.
4339663	4341124	I will definitely join you guys, though.
4341445	4344327	I hear that All Games is expanding to do tournaments throughout the week.
4344627	4346329	So I will definitely join.
4346369	4347910	But I will join on a Saturday.
4347950	4348431	I promise.
4348491	4351813	But I do Rocky every other Saturday, and that keeps me kind of busy.
4352054	4353215	All right.
4353235	4353515	Fair enough.
4353535	4354996	I just forgot to give you a little grief for that.
4355036	4355376	All right.
4355417	4358199	Thank you for the public humiliation in front of thousands.
4358479	4358659	I mean 20.
4358699	4359160	No problem.
4360217	4361698	The Humiliation in front of 20 listeners.
4362238	4362518	Alright.
4363078	4364858	Alright, Rob D, you ready to play Beat the Host?
4365379	4365719	Of course.
4365759	4367699	Well, then we need some cheesy theme music.
4369340	4372761	What the fuck is this?
4374741	4377602	That's right, it's time to play Beat the Host!
4377682	4378603	No, I'm kidding, I'm not gonna do that.
4378883	4383644	Alright, the way Beat the Host works is you're gonna choose somebody here in studio to challenge.
4383944	4387125	You can challenge Casper the Gay, also known as Big Gay Eddie.
4387525	4388426	You can challenge Big Gay Eddie.
4388626	4389686	You can challenge Loki...
4390509	4394030	You can challenge Rice Princess or Lanky Style.
4394070	4397131	And tonight's topic is classic video games.
4397191	4399832	We have changed up the rules a little bit, but I'll explain that as we move on.
4400072	4401932	First off, Rob D., who are you going to challenge?
4402772	4403033	You know what?
4403053	4403973	I'll press my luck a little bit.
4403993	4404773	I'll go with Loki.
4405293	4406133	Loki!
4406253	4407474	Loki's being challenging.
4407514	4407834	Surprise.
4408394	4409194	Everyone picks Loki.
4409234	4409694	All right.
4410755	4411975	He's like the center square.
4412075	4414216	He's the Whoopi Goldberg of our program.
4414716	4415016	All right.
4415546	4416367	10 Classic Arcade Games
4435978	4439781	What we're going to do is you're going to have two minutes to guess the ten games.
4440181	4444924	So I will continue to play the music until you correctly guess the song.
4445164	4446245	This goes for you as well, Loki.
4446485	4451148	I'll continue to play the music until you correctly guess the song, at which point I'll go to the next song.
4451428	4455091	However, you can always skip ahead to the next song by just saying, pass.
4455331	4456311	You want to go to the next song.
4456572	4459694	So you have two minutes to knock all ten of them out.
4459714	4460914	Sounds good.
4460974	4463636	And if you beat Loki, you win a fabulous prize.
4463656	4464857	Are you on MySpace, Rob D.?
4465886	4466307	Yes, I am.
4466507	4470871	All right, then, Rob D., by winning tonight, you'll earn a space in our MySpace Top Friends.
4470891	4475475	Now, are we supposed to do this like the old one where we just shout out the answers, or do we want to write them down?
4475535	4478437	No, this time it's not like the way we used to do it where we have to say it all at the end.
4478457	4479778	You're going to say it while it's going on.
4480039	4481240	And tonight is a killer.
4481280	4483642	You're probably going to run through a bunch of games until you get it right.
4483962	4487425	But if I don't say anything, then you haven't guessed it right yet.
4487625	4487986	All right.
4488326	4491789	All right, Loki is now going to leave the studio and head to our isolation booth.
4492855	4494756	Somebody keep an eye on him and make sure he's not cheating.
4494776	4495796	Isolation booth.
4495816	4496836	We have an isolation booth.
4496856	4497577	Like the old game shows.
4499517	4507139	So out of curiosity, is the Orange Lounge Radio MySpace friend list easier or harder to get onto than Scott Rubin's friends list on Xbox Live?
4507559	4512181	It's actually a little harder because I finally got onto Scott Rubin's friends list on Xbox Live.
4513261	4515542	And I'm almost kicked out of Orange Lounge's top 20.
4518082	4519883	Anybody want to talk shit about Loki while he's not here?
4522584	4524725	Alright, Rob D, you ready to start?
4525485	4525905	You know it.
4526185	4527085	Alright, then here we go.
4527145	4529166	Your two minutes begins now.
4533427	4534787	Pass.
4534827	4535247	Pass.
4538088	4548510	I'm going to say Missile Commander, Defender.
4548570	4549151	Actually, Defender.
4549171	4549631	Defender.
4549651	4549951	No, no.
4549971	4550431	Defender.
4551471	4552052	Not Defender.
4552352	4561078	I'm going to say R-Type.
4561399	4561639	No.
4561799	4563480	I'll have to skip this one.
4564181	4564421	Pass.
4564481	4565322	Um, BurgerTime?
4565362	4566222	Yes, correct.
4566242	4566903	One.
4588129	4588489	Tapper?
4589009	4589250	No.
4591992	4592572	One minute left.
4592953	4593273	No idea.
4593293	4594454	You gonna pass?
4594754	4595014	Yeah.
4596736	4601139	That's Frogger.
4601200	4601720	Yes, correct.
4617113	4617393	Pass.
4617433	4617553	Pass.
4617573	4618294	30 seconds left.
4618314	4619415	20 seconds.
4619475	4622197	I do know this one, but I forget what it is, so I'm going to pass on that.
4622257	4622517	All right.
4622537	4622877	15 seconds.
4646577	4646937	Astro's?
4647257	4651679	Five, no, four, three, two, one.
4652340	4653180	Time's up!
4653800	4654480	Ah, I suck.
4654661	4656721	That was hard, you didn't even get to the last one.
4656781	4658042	This is a tough category tonight.
4658462	4662004	Our chat room's even struggling tonight, but you did get two right, and that may be enough to beat Loki.
4662404	4662864	So we shall see.
4662944	4667666	I don't know, my classic arcade game knowledge is a little bit limited on that one, fortunately.
4669007	4669547	Good luck, Loki.
4670120	4670640	All right, well, here we go.
4670660	4671961	We're going to bring Loki back in studio.
4672001	4673462	If LankyStyle would please go grab Loki.
4673642	4674603	How is LankyStyle doing?
4675303	4677024	He actually got a few of them, yeah.
4677304	4679026	He would have been a very formidable opponent.
4679106	4680647	All right, well, it's a good thing Rob D didn't pick him.
4681067	4682688	I'm glad he picked a total loser like Loki.
4682928	4684229	Hi, Loki, how you doing?
4684489	4684929	Welcome back.
4685570	4689092	Loki's wearing the wedding shirt that Jamie and I got him, the one that says Game Over.
4689572	4689772	Yes.
4690012	4690292	All right.
4690312	4693715	All right, well, I can't tell you what Rob D got just yet, but we'll see.
4693735	4694415	It's a tough category.
4694635	4695736	Anyway, I need you to look that way.
4696216	4697577	All right, and you're going to name off.
4698164	4699584	I don't want them to see what songs are on screen.
4699604	4700104	So here we go.
4700444	4702205	Again, just say pass if you want to pass.
4702265	4705545	You have two minutes, and your two minutes starts right now.
4706546	4706726	Yes.
4706746	4707106	Pass.
4707126	4707306	Pass.
4729148	4729869	DigDug?
4729909	4730029	No.
4730069	4730429	Mr. Dew?
4730570	4730850	No.
4730930	4731410	BurgerTime?
4731451	4731611	Yes.
4731631	4731951	Pass.
4732231	4732371	Pass.
4759529	4760229	Contra?
4760309	4760710	Nope.
4760810	4761550	One minute.
4761570	4761790	Pass.
4761870	4762550	TikTok.
4762570	4762691	Yes.
4762731	4762931	Pass.
4784350	4784730	45 seconds.
4784770	4785070	Pass.
4785090	4790492	30 seconds.
4791893	4792373	Pass.
4793113	4795474	We're back to when you passed the first time.
4795514	4795474	1942.
4795574	4795914	No.
4795934	4796314	Minecraft.
4796455	4796595	No.
4814532	4829492	8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, all done.
4829592	4830573	All right, let's add it up.
4830614	4831515	Let's see how you guys did.
4832285	4837047	Loki, actually I should say Rob D got two right, but Loki got three right.
4837107	4837988	Loki, you win.
4838648	4841549	You know, in a lot of them I recognized, I was like, I couldn't place them.
4841850	4842730	It was really hard tonight.
4842750	4843750	Charm was doing very well, though.
4844031	4845671	Rob D, I'm so sorry you didn't win.
4846312	4846932	That happens.
4846972	4847632	Good job, Loki.
4847792	4848072	All right.
4848112	4849113	Better luck next time, though.
4849133	4850353	You want to hear the right answers, though?
4850373	4851014	I bet you want to know them.
4851034	4852094	Yes, I do.
4852434	4853035	Oh, damn it.
4853235	4854195	Are we allowed to guess them?
4854315	4855616	Or Tempest and Bubble Bobble in there?
4856562	4857483	Yes, they both were.
4857543	4859224	What were you thinking, Rice Princess?
4859584	4861065	Are we allowed to guess them as you go on?
4861085	4861845	Sure, why not?
4862025	4862665	Okay, so just play them.
4862685	4864166	You didn't cheat, though, because the names are up on the screen.
4864186	4865007	No, I can't even see from here.
4865027	4865347	Okay, good.
4865367	4865707	Here we go.
4866447	4867628	What do you think, Rice Princess?
4867648	4868288	This is Bubble Bobble.
4868308	4869049	Loki guessed that one.
4869069	4870229	What do you think this one is?
4872130	4872730	Robotron?
4872991	4873271	No.
4874011	4874211	Oh.
4875352	4876472	I have no fucking clue.
4876532	4876973	Tempest.
4877013	4878413	That's one.
4878493	4878753	Oh.
4878853	4879134	All right.
4879154	4880074	Somebody got this.
4880114	4880995	This is Burger Time.
4881355	4883256	We both got that, actually.
4886578	4889961	Yeah, I've got no clue.
4890301	4890701	No idea?
4891121	4891241	Nope.
4891882	4895985	Even, I think if I let it go in here a little bit more, it's the... Hold on.
4896105	4899067	I think it's right here.
4899567	4900267	You might recognize this.
4903349	4903750	You remember that?
4903790	4904690	Crystal Castles!
4905511	4907872	Crystal Castles.
4907912	4908173	Oh, yeah.
4908193	4909313	Alright, this looks stronger.
4909333	4910074	That's stronger.
4911935	4913116	This one's a real toughie.
4913156	4914637	I don't know if anyone got this right.
4916158	4916779	This is a tough one.
4916799	4917919	I think somebody in studio said it though.
4917939	4918560	This could be Zaxxon.
4918580	4919180	It is Zaxxon.
4919280	4919821	Oh, damn it!
4919841	4919981	Zaxxon.
4920001	4920321	Good job.
4920341	4921602	This one's one of my favorites.
4945310	4947691	I'll give you a hint because it involves penguins.
4948631	4949511	Sega made.
4951351	4953472	Push cubes around and swoosh little blobs.
4955072	4955893	Pango.
4956013	4956893	It's Pango.
4956933	4958753	Okay, this one is the killer.
4959193	4960374	I don't know if anyone got this one.
4960394	4966515	I wasn't watching chat.
4966895	4967775	Namco made.
4969156	4970836	In most of their collections of games.
4971876	4973857	Knights of the Round?
4974077	4974257	Nope.
4974821	4982066	Sword Game, incredibly slow-moving character, The Tower of Druaga.
4982206	4984267	The Tower of Druaga was the last one.
4984287	4984988	I know, I'm like, what?
4985028	4985969	I said it was a killer.
4986489	4994174	All right, there it was, your ten songs, Bubble Bobble, Tempest, Burger Time, Crystal Castles, Frogger, 1943, Dig Dug, Zaxxon, Pengo, Tower of Druaga.
4994194	4998057	That was killer, but Rob D., you made a good showing, and we appreciate your participation.
4998557	5000918	All right, thanks for taking my call, and thanks for letting me participate.
5000959	5004601	And as a consolation prize, a lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni.
5005325	5006125	All right, sounds great.
5006165	5006886	All right, have a good one.
5006906	5007766	San Francisco treat.
5007986	5008946	I'll see you guys later.
5008986	5009627	All right, later, buddy.
5010567	5011988	Rice Princess-a-roni.
5012328	5013448	Rice Princess-a-roni?
5014208	5014809	Yeah, sure.
5015089	5015849	All right, there you go.
5017149	5017510	All right.
5017990	5021031	Dark Tetsuya said he would have gotten five, and he knew the Tower of Druaga.
5021971	5023172	Looks like some folks knew Pingo.
5023212	5024052	That was very good.
5024812	5028414	You know, Zaxxon sounded so familiar, and then I just had to think about it for a little bit.
5028454	5030595	I'm like, ah, crap.
5030715	5031655	That was a tough one.
5032043	5036385	And by the way, I pulled all those games off GameTap earlier today because I have a bunch of those games.
5036745	5040007	And it's really easy for me to dump when the game is on a computer, the audio.
5040467	5045050	And when I picked Zaxxon at first, I was like, oh, it'll be easy to recognize.
5045090	5046791	And like I was playing, I was like, this is really hard.
5046831	5048011	Maybe I should switch it out.
5048071	5050012	But no, I kept it in there.
5050692	5052413	But the Tower of Draugr, man, that's killer.
5052774	5053374	That is freaking killer.
5053394	5053954	You know what would be cool?
5053974	5057596	You should do old PC games or something like that because no one would get that stuff.
5057676	5057976	All right.
5058396	5061458	Rob D in chat, he's back in chat and yelling...
5061843	5062323	Coji Kondo
5090403	5091384	If you know who he is, anyway.
5091984	5092864	He's the author.
5092884	5096965	Yeah, he made Legend of Zelda music, Star Fox, Mario.
5097066	5098406	I mean, the guy's a legend, right?
5098786	5104988	Well, he is going to be performing at Video Games Live this year in San Francisco.
5105088	5107249	That's March 9th at 8 p.m.
5107289	5111791	That's the show during the Game Developers Conference, which I may or may not be going to.
5112191	5113771	I'm still trying to work out some last-minute details.
5113811	5114812	I'm hoping to go to...
5116190	5118171	I really wanna go just to see this.
5118191	5119051	I think it'll be great.
5119171	5120091	A lot of the songs they play...
5138439	5139560	at a Video Games Live.
5139840	5141941	I don't know if I get, but I think it would be really cool.
5142261	5145703	You know, like, I did not get into some of the LucasArts games like a lot of people did.
5145743	5153746	I mean, I do love Loom and Monkey Island, some of that stuff, but apparently they're going to have some LucasArts stuff, and apparently there's going to be a Contra presentation, which should be interesting.
5153966	5155667	But when I think about Contra, I don't think about the music.
5155887	5156368	Is it just me?
5156888	5157228	I don't know.
5157368	5162511	Some of the last, you know, games were pretty, you know, heavy metal, which would be kind of cool to see perform live.
5163431	5164211	Oh, yeah, Kira.
5164391	5165052	That would be awesome.
5165172	5165432	All right.
5166058	5170882	Well, I guess we've got one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR.
5171102	5179688	So, you know, the big story is Itagaki is working on something new, and something that doesn't have to do with boobies, apparently.
5179768	5180989	Is it day rape?
5181790	5183691	No, it's not day rape.
5183771	5184612	But here's the thing, though.
5185012	5185593	Everyone's like...
5186918	5187579	Thank you for watching!
5214403	5214663	Why?
5215084	5216044	We're back to that again, huh?
5216064	5217565	Did you say me and Almond Joy here?
5217725	5218066	Oh, yay.
5219106	5219527	Oh, sorry.
5219547	5220027	We're on the air.
5221288	5222029	I love Almond Joy.
5222069	5222489	Coconut.
5222589	5223330	Dude, almonds.
5224370	5226172	Or as my dad would say, Ammon Joy.
5226432	5227132	Oh, it's shaped like an egg.
5227172	5228093	I can shove it up your ass.
5228133	5228814	You'd probably like that.
5229214	5229974	You have some almonds?
5230375	5230975	Some almonds?
5231035	5231656	That's what my dad says.
5231676	5232516	You like almonds?
5233557	5234258	Almonds are crunchy.
5234778	5237420	You know they have a big almond factory in downtown Sacramento.
5238381	5238661	Oh, yeah?
5239021	5239321	Diamond.
5239421	5240082	Have you ever driven by it?
5241423	5242264	Oh, yeah.
5242284	5242884	We're on a video game show.
5243168	5247270	Well, I guess we should let some callers call in and direct the show otherwise.
5247290	5250291	1-877-GAME-OLR, there's always our Skype line, username OrangeLoungeRadio.
5250551	5256014	There's more information on our website, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, by clicking on Interact With Us.
5256334	5257034	Let's go to the phones.
5257534	5258495	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5258515	5258895	Who's this?
5259755	5260536	Raven's Dolphin.
5260716	5261676	Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
5261716	5263577	Oh, I got time to eat my egg here.
5263617	5264417	You like Almond Joys?
5265198	5266178	I love Almond Joys.
5266198	5267399	I know, it's good stuff.
5267419	5268279	All right, what's on your mind, buddy?
5269187	5270628	I like GameTap, especially Abe Lincoln Must Die.
5296621	5297341	I haven't even played that.
5297361	5298202	What the hell is that?
5298362	5298962	That sounds awesome.
5298982	5300222	That's a new Sam & Max episode.
5301282	5301483	Oh.
5301803	5303603	No, I need to play the Sam & Max games.
5303783	5307905	If you played Sam & Max, you would know, does the carpet match the drapes?
5309385	5310365	I don't want to know the answer to that.
5310625	5314947	I seriously need to ban myself from World of Warcraft for a week so I can play some of these computer games I've been missing.
5315347	5316407	Have you checked out Myst Online?
5318088	5320769	I haven't gotten into it, but I heard it's great.
5321989	5322369	I want to.
5323049	5324930	Are you a fan of Myst, Eddie?
5325130	5325150	I
5326277	5327277	I'm a huge fan of Myst.
5327297	5327877	I love Myst.
5327917	5328497	It's awesome.
5328997	5330278	And, yeah, it's cool.
5331598	5333138	I'm surprised you don't know about Myst online, then.
5333178	5334458	It just opened up on Valentine's Day.
5334839	5338079	And he has this, like, Christmas little boy face on right now.
5338539	5343480	Well, yeah, because I'm, like, probably the only person who still likes point-and-click games, so I'm like, oh, Myst!
5343500	5345860	Point-and-click.
5345880	5348261	Alright, Ravenstaff and Will, what else do you have in mind tonight?
5349441	5352622	Uh, I... Oh, I got a point to pick with Loki.
5353182	5354282	Alright, Loki.
5355390	5356811	Raven's Dolphin is going to pick your bones.
5358011	5358311	Ew.
5358892	5359932	All right, what's on your mind?
5360812	5363694	Loki, you said about 15-inch television.
5363894	5369096	I own a 15-inch television, and I'm not gay, and you said go buy a PC monitor.
5369156	5369916	I don't have money.
5369976	5374719	My mom said, here, have this 15-inch HDTV monitor.
5375199	5376299	Wouldn't you like it for games?
5376379	5377040	And I said, yes.
5378280	5381361	When in the hell did he say that 15-inch monitors made you gay?
5381842	5383122	I don't even remember saying that.
5383522	5384023	I never said that.
5384043	5384783	It's interactive.
5385880	5388143	Oh, when you are on all games on Monday, you must have said it.
5388163	5390425	I don't even remember saying that.
5390566	5391006	You know what?
5391026	5394190	Scott totally sets us up to say mean things so we get angry listeners.
5394250	5398756	No, I think what I was saying... I think what I was saying... I can't remember...
5400069	5402330	Oh, I remember now.
5402831	5408794	Because someone had a 15-inch LCD TV or whatever, and they spent, I forget how much money on it.
5409134	5413396	And I said, well, you should just go buy a fucking monitor because they're a lot cheaper.
5414036	5421340	You can get a 19-inch or even a 21-inch or whatever, and you can do HD on a PC monitor.
5421420	5424182	So just spend the money on that instead.
5426063	5426243	Yeah.
5427398	5428159	All right, well, there.
5428179	5432182	I never said gay, though, ever in that, you know, argument.
5433163	5434984	I said retarded, but not gay.
5435284	5436225	I was improv-ing.
5436605	5436905	All right.
5437266	5437706	What else?
5438106	5439107	One more thing.
5439187	5440168	It's always one more thing.
5440888	5441149	All right.
5441549	5443030	It's your trademark, though, you know?
5443651	5443831	Yeah.
5443931	5446793	You should have... Do you have a MySpace Raven's Dolphin?
5447293	5447814	Yes, I do.
5447874	5448734	Okay, yeah.
5448774	5456560	You need to get one and put a little picture of yourself on there with little text on it that says, one more thing, and, like, you should have, like, a little picture of you going, like, with a hand.
5456580	5456901	One.
5457101	5457181	One.
5458763	5459523	What's your one more thing?
5462106	5477958	My headset is orange for Orange Lounge Radio Aww I just threw up in my mouth Alright, thanks Raven Stolfen, you're cool You too, bye Alright, take care, bye Let's go to another phone call What was that?
5477978	5479580	What the hell did I do there?
5479600	5484604	I have no idea I'm eagerly anticipating chicken shoot Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
5486175	5487576	Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.
5487756	5489037	Hi, Paradox Vincent!
5490518	5491259	What's on your mind?
5491679	5494341	Not much.
5495722	5496243	Not much?
5496343	5498144	Well, what the hell are you calling us for tonight?
5498184	5499545	What do you want to talk to us about?
5502708	5511274	I just think that on the Best Buy story, did that cover their internal...
5514116	5519742	The whole scandal on their big internal internet is their external internet website.
5521203	5522584	No, we did not cover that story.
5522644	5523685	What the hell is this about?
5523725	5527049	So the Best Buy, their internal is the external site?
5527069	5527569	What's this about?
5528970	5537158	Well, basically, I've heard that they'll offer sales on their external website, which you can access from home.
5539096	5546758	and they'll say, oh, well, there's a sale on this, so I want to go pick it up, you know, pick up this camera that's been discounted down to $130.
5548618	5550339	But then you go and they won't let you have it.
5552559	5568523	Yeah, and then they say, oh, that sale ended at 7 plus time and you said, well, I checked the website and they say, oh, the website must have been responding slowly, let's go check this one in store and then they'll go check it and show you, see where it ended at this date
5569185	5572347	and, um, I just think that's true.
5588917	5600452	and then you have Walmart and Target both sell things on their website that they don't even sell in the stores the reason why they don't show you that price on there is because sometimes they will have an agreement with the publisher or whoever
5600796	5601096	DarkSakura.com
5625461	5639452	And a lot of times Best Buy is retarded, though, because I went in for a camera that was marked down and priced like a couple hundred dollars, and they said they didn't have it, but they were retarded because it was actually last year's model that, you know, it was marked down.
5639492	5641333	They had it in, like, a shelf.
5641373	5643755	They had to actually open up, like, a cabinet to get this thing out.
5644376	5647198	So it might be just retarded for an employee.
5648304	5651946	I don't even think that they say that it's online only sale.
5652467	5655388	I really don't think that it is an online only sale.
5657950	5660511	I just think it's really too shady for anything.
5660632	5661772	Is it shady?
5662132	5662473	Yes.
5662893	5663813	Is it illegal?
5664034	5664274	No.
5664974	5668056	So there's really not a lot we can do about it but take our dollars elsewhere.
5669797	5676561	Yeah, and I'm also really excited about the gold testing in Naperville because I'm really hoping that
5677085	5684971	means they'll bring it out here and that the arcade in Arizona will get gold because it seriously needs an upgrade from that.
5685272	5689675	You know, again, I think, again, he's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold.
5689715	5693918	If you don't know, if you're a new listener to Orange Lounge, you don't know the Bomani music game scene.
5694359	5703846	He's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold, which is basically the 14th release for Japan, the first one they're testing in the arcades here, although they did put the game out as Beatmania on U.S.
5703866	5704567	consoles a while ago.
5705480	5713383	Yeah, you know, I think if the machine does insanely well, which it has the potential to do, I think you're going to have a lot of people driving in to play the machine from nearby areas.
5713783	5715684	I think you're going to start seeing this.
5715984	5720225	The only blockade is going to be the machine is still going to be one of the more expensive ones to purchase.
5720545	5723026	But I think you're going to see arcades around the areas take the plunge.
5723346	5729329	I'm sure the Golf Land chain, which is big on the West Coast, especially California, Arizona, I'm sure they'll take the plunge.
5729389	5730429	They usually do at Bomani Games.
5731835	5732795	I really wish they do.
5733335	5739437	And I think that's what they might have been working on while they wanted to work on Beat Mini US 2.
5740537	5742098	I think they might have... Maybe?
5742578	5745498	Maybe they said, what the hell are we doing two separate games for?
5745599	5747299	Let's just make it the same.
5747379	5748979	And I say, it's about time.
5750740	5751100	Yeah.
5751780	5752920	I do think it's about time.
5753200	5753460	Alright.
5753821	5755521	Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for the call.
5755761	5756381	Take care, buddy.
5756681	5757642	And we'll see you next time, alright?
5757842	5758182	Alright.
5758682	5758902	Later.
5760020	5763902	and we'll keep our fingers and toes crossed that they will bring the game to you very soon.
5764722	5766483	To all of us, because I would like to play 2DX Gold.
5766523	5766983	I don't know about you.
5767243	5770284	LankyStyle, you're a big fan of Beatmania 2DX, aren't you?
5771485	5771945	I used to be.
5772085	5774726	Did you hear about Beatmania 2DX Gold testing over here in the US?
5775167	5775367	Nope.
5776247	5776667	What's that?
5778308	5779428	The 14th version.
5779488	5781229	Why did you stop playing Beatmania 2DX?
5781689	5783470	I've been doing other things.
5784591	5785671	Like masturbating?
5787092	5787232	No.
5787792	5787972	Okay.
5789775	5790575	Like writing a book?
5791496	5791716	Yes.
5793156	5794297	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5794337	5796417	Who's this?
5796477	5799318	Sorry to call in again, but I do have a couple of comments to make about games.
5799659	5799959	All right.
5799999	5802800	Well, Rob D., I suppose, as long as you're going to keep it on topic.
5803520	5805821	But no talking about Ammonjoys, or I'll have to hang up.
5807201	5808582	I don't think you have to worry about that from me.
5808682	5809022	All right.
5810403	5812663	Okay, so, I don't know.
5812863	5816685	You guys were talking about the Wii earlier and how it does have problems with...
5817591	5820995	with games and games coming out, and the lack of games for it, for that matter.
5821896	5824759	I don't know, I think that all three consoles have trouble with games at this point.
5825560	5828343	Actually, yeah, they do all have trouble with games in some way, shape, or form.
5828383	5831426	The 360 has a lack of variety with its games.
5831486	5837653	If you're an RPG fan, if you're a fighting game fan, if you're a platformer fan, I can't imagine you're too thrilled with the 360's game lineup.
5837918	5841900	True, and you just said Rice Princess right there, right?
5842020	5843741	Oh my god, you're my hero, Kirsten.
5843801	5846262	This is why you have never been a big Microsoft fan, correct?
5846342	5846983	Pretty much, yeah.
5847063	5849144	Are you going to change your mind on 360 anytime soon?
5849204	5849324	No.
5849544	5850345	Not even Blue Dragon?
5850505	5851045	Nope.
5851085	5851945	Sorry, Rob D, keep going.
5853026	5854327	And then the Wii, obviously.
5854807	5857288	It just came out, but it does have some trouble with games right now.
5857408	5866513	I think a lot of third-party developers are unwilling to hop on the bandwagon, or were unwilling to hop on the bandwagon because of the odd nature of the controller.
5867580	5871302	and now I think by Christmas you'll see a lot more developers willing to give it a shot.
5871923	5873544	Do you think maybe it's just the time of year?
5873964	5876266	Like, you know, because this is usually kind of a slow period for games.
5876326	5879708	We don't see a lot of big games start really hitting until summer.
5879988	5882810	Like, you know, come May, June, we'll start seeing more games in November.
5882870	5884731	Whoa, big flood of games.
5884751	5888213	Do you think maybe that's just part of it, why we feel a little bit robbed right now?
5888613	5889434	No pun intended.
5889574	5890955	Probably, but I think that's...
5891759	5894420	The E3 PowerPoint Expo in May will be very telling.
5894660	5896080	The PowerPoint Expo?
5896280	5900382	To see what people announce and see what people have for the Wii, the PS3, and the 360.
5901102	5909024	I'm hearing that the E3 Elitism Expo is actually supposed to be now possibly all the way to October.
5910475	5912356	Well, because distribution is in a whole different category, so... Oh yeah, that.
5939884	5942125	Isn't it funny how no one's excited about E3 now?
5942325	5943146	Oh, fuck E3.
5943166	5943846	Who gives a shit?
5943946	5945367	It's going to be... Well, there went our invite.
5945847	5948449	Well, it's no longer a rock star show like it used to be.
5948529	5949369	Oh, yeah.
5949389	5951050	Well, actually, yeah.
5951130	5955493	Yeah, it's no longer a big show, and rock star is never there anyways, so we went and see Grand Theft Auto.
5955533	5955893	Dude.
5956333	5959735	Well, I meant rock stars and, like, giant sound systems and that sort of thing.
5959755	5965598	Look, last year when I got diverted walking around the booth because of Paris Hilton, I was pissed.
5965658	5966279	I was so pissed.
5966299	5968300	I was like, this show just makes me mad.
5970290	5970510	Yep.
5970970	5972151	Although I did have a great time.
5973212	5974113	I did have a great time.
5974173	5977655	It was really fun to play all the new games and talk about them, but damn, Paris Hilton.
5977755	5979756	I mean, man, fuck her.
5980016	5980697	Anything else, Rob?
5981637	5981898	I don't know.
5981918	5983759	I think this Christmas is going to be very interesting.
5983819	5988342	I think the coming years are going to be very interesting because the console race is really wide open this year.
5988862	5991144	Well, this generation.
5991264	5994446	The established leaders problems are well documented.
5994526	5998969	Sony's got a lot of problems because they're trying to make a they're trying to release a system that's
6000107	6004130	All-in-One Media Center for $600 when all we want is a game machine.
6004971	6016158	We ask a lot of people on the program what the PS3 can do to get a bigger foot in the marketplace here and get some of their love back from all us PS2 loyalists, because I'll tell you, I love my PlayStation 2, but I'm not so hot on the PlayStation 3.
6016218	6020641	I'm going to ask you, what will Sony do, you think?
6022022	6024624	I think we might see a price drop by this Christmas, honestly.
6024664	6026405	I don't know how they're going to survive otherwise.
6027086	6027646	I really don't.
6027666	6027646	$600?
6027686	6027646	$500? $500?
6029500	6041224	It's a lot easier to convince kids' parents or even to convince 20 to 30-year-olds or teenagers with jobs to get the 360, which is going to have a price drop.
6041244	6042544	You know that by this Christmas.
6043444	6044385	No question about that.
6044585	6045745	They're well overdue for one.
6046065	6047166	Or the Wii, which is $250.
6047406	6048906	You know what, though?
6048926	6052927	If worse comes to worse, though, you'll get your lame movie tie-in games that'll sell like crazy.
6052967	6055008	Wasn't Cars the biggest selling game last year?
6056217	6056818	or something?
6056838	6057578	I don't know.
6057939	6059199	It was some lame movie tie-in game.
6059219	6060580	It was like the highest selling game last year.
6062222	6063563	There was, well, Madden.
6063763	6064923	Madden's always the big one.
6065804	6071088	And movie tie-in stuff, I don't know.
6071188	6079834	Cars did okay, but it came out back in June and then the sales had already died by the time it came into Christmas, so.
6081045	6083946	Zappy says Cars was number three, Madden was number one.
6084166	6097948	But I'm just saying, although there may not be a lot for us hardcore gamers, the casual gamers and the kiddies, they do have a really big pull in this market we often neglect when we're coming up with all these consensuses.
6099429	6103849	Yeah, but yeah, it is Sony, so who knows if they'll actually have that price drop.
6105050	6105450	We'll see.
6105650	6106570	I hope so, for their sake.
6107435	6112899	Because otherwise I don't know how they're going to... Well, actually, again, the thing is, we'll see where the Japanese developers go, too.
6113380	6117082	The ones that make the platformers, the RPGs, the fighting games, because they're not too high on Microsoft.
6117283	6119144	Well, at least they always have Ridge Racer.
6119925	6120385	Exactly.
6120885	6121726	And the Eye of Judgment.
6122647	6124968	I know what they're going to do, Rob, to save themselves.
6125008	6129932	Sony's going to include a copy of Rainbow Island with the system.
6130513	6131473	That's a brilliant idea.
6131633	6131994	I know.
6132174	6133355	God, you should go work for Sony.
6133635	6134295	I shouldn't.
6135096	6136237	Thank you, Rob, for the call.
6137116	6138437	All right, thanks for taking me again.
6138537	6139098	No problem.
6139118	6140179	I won't play your show anymore.
6140439	6141360	All right, no problem.
6141661	6141921	Later.
6142001	6142181	Bye.
6142922	6148007	We just kind of hit the answer button on whoever's on deck, but unfortunately we got to call it a night.
6148227	6150029	We're running kind of long.
6150049	6152311	We took a bunch of calls in Part A. We've had a lot of people on the show tonight.
6152631	6154393	Although we do appreciate all you guys calling in.
6154413	6155314	We're sorry to those digging through.
6155334	6158637	There were seriously like five people still hammering the line, so I'm so sorry to those of you guys.
6158677	6160399	We'll try to get you guys next week.
6160499	6161040	I'm sorry.
6162142	6163363	Aw, you make me feel bad.
6163383	6164484	Do you want to do one real quick?
6164644	6166545	Yeah, sure, even though you just hung up on something.
6166605	6168246	Real, real, real freaking quick.
6168426	6169387	Okay, 60 seconds.
6169587	6170428	Orange House Radio, who's this?
6171188	6171869	Legend of Zaku.
6171889	6172889	Alright, Zaku, get it out.
6174110	6181955	Um, just the fact that it's my understanding that the PS3 is just going to become that sinking ship, the Titanic.
6182535	6183976	Yes, it is.
6184236	6185517	I'll never let go, Zaku.
6185977	6186718	I'll never let go.
6187438	6188279	Oh, please, yes.
6191636	6201641	I'm just worried about, you know, honestly, you know, what I'm worried about right now is other games, you know, such as Crackdown, selling other things like, you know, for example, the Halo 3 beta.
6202522	6213128	I mean, seeing that Crackdown is a really good game, I don't know if, you know, the Halo 3, all that hype might actually, you know, help the series in the long term.
6214905	6219769	Zaku, with the remaining 15 seconds, how can Sony get out of this mess?
6220090	6222451	Minus the Final Fantasy XIII and Metal Gear Solid 4.
6224273	6225474	Minus the two big ones.
6225614	6226555	Everybody knows about those.
6226635	6227395	Minus those two.
6228757	6231579	They need to get more downloadable content, more downloadable games.
6232259	6234781	Flow and Qbert, I think, are not cutting it right now.
6235362	6239525	So they need that and just, you know... But what about Warlock?
6240366	6241367	Oh yeah, that too, but...
6242375	6248058	But you have to also consider that it needs to compete with the likes of the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console.
6248098	6251159	They need to get all their cards out just to be in the same footing.
6251399	6251939	You know what they need?
6251959	6252720	Achievement points.
6253060	6253400	Seriously.
6253440	6253760	That too.
6254220	6254500	All right.
6255021	6257302	Zaku, gotta let you go, but thanks so much for the call.
6258002	6258282	All right.
6258382	6258762	Later, buddy.
6259422	6259663	All right.
6259703	6260423	Bye.
6260463	6260903	That's it.
6261043	6261363	All right.
6262404	6263604	I just feel bad for this one.
6264405	6264945	Hi, who's this?
6266425	6267105	It's Ranma.
6267125	6272227	You know, I'm still pissed that I was on a pod coming up from a con while I missed an awesome show last week.
6272647	6273388	I'm sorry to hear that.
6273708	6274168	30 seconds.
6274308	6275108	Quick, con review.
6276349	6276649	Okay.
6276969	6277749	Con was great.
6277989	6282871	One of the guys in the chat, Mr. Wonderful, will be doing a complete con report for you guys and you should have it by next week.
6283171	6288553	Also to reiterate for Best Buy, yes, they do price max, but the trick is there's got to be a local store in the area.
6288894	6289254	How's that?
6289854	6290454	That's beautiful.
6290494	6291054	Thank you, Ranma.
6292215	6292515	Later.
6292575	6292815	Bye.
6293328	6294369	All our calls should be like that.
6294549	6296170	Wow, he's like fucking in and out.

6343126	6348831	Speaking of which, God damn it, right there, that's what the PlayStation 3 needs.
6349331	6350532	LaserCats the game.
6351433	6355096	Show of hands, if they put out LaserCats the game on the PlayStation 3, who would buy?
6355576	6356997	All the hands in the room are up.
6357077	6358118	My feet are up too.
6358258	6359419	Oh my god, there it is.
6360320	6363022	Dude, somebody put a phone call into Sony right now.
6363262	6365144	Dude, look up Sony's number.
6365304	6366585	Can we call them right now?

6372065	6372565	Yo, soon.
6372685	6373186	Alright, fine.
6373446	6373966	Keys are true.
6374486	6376467	Dude, LaserCats, the game could save the PlayStation 3.
6377108	6377888	Oh my god.
6378708	6379829	I want a LaserCat.
6380529	6381150	I really do.
6381270	6382670	Nobody knows what we're talking about, do they?
6384331	6385592	Oh my god, they totally should.
6385932	6390914	Paradox, Vincent, Chat, Hands, Feet, SSJ100, Matt, LaserCats over Thundercats.
6392555	6393496	ActDeft says nope.
6394456	6397898	No, they should just have a LaserCats cover for the Wiimote.
6397918	6398658	There you go.
6399098	6399939	Alright, sorry to interrupt.
6399999	6400199	Anyway.
6401055	6401855	Let's make one.
6402175	6403436	We'll sell it on eBay.
6403516	6406637	Just like cut out a stuffed animal cat.
6406677	6408717	Just like take the stuffing out of a stuffed animal cat.
6408737	6409237	No, no, no.
6409317	6410298	And like slide it over the window.
6410318	6411198	No, we're going to go further.
6411278	6416379	We're going to get an actual cat, you know, get a taxidermist to make one.
6416399	6417960	Meow, meow, meow.
6418060	6419640	Hey, Eddie, you forgot one thing.
6420561	6421941	I just started using laser cat skin.
6425822	6427003	I love laser cats.
6427483	6428464	Oh, God.
6429045	6430366	We should be designing games.
6430926	6431807	And cats.
6432407	6436951	Let's quit the show and start Orange Lounge Games, even though that Konami might sue us over that.
6437211	6440574	We'll just start, you know, Orange Tabby Cat.
6440774	6444577	Or, I don't know, we'll start, you know, Peach Lounge Games or something.
6444757	6445698	That's terrible.
6446319	6447440	How about Sunrise?
6447460	6449061	Yeah, there you go, Sunrise.
6449081	6450322	I don't know, Tangerine.
6450582	6451843	Or Irene Mooning Me.
6452143	6452524	I don't know.
6452584	6452844	All right.
6453044	6453564	Okay.
6454425	6455386	Anything else, Loki?
6457139	6457659	That's about it.
6458259	6458559	Alright.
6460520	6460880	We're dorks.
6461520	6463540	Gaming Nerd says Samurai Laser Cats.
6464660	6466101	Samurai Laser Cats.
6467341	6468801	I used to watch that cartoon.
6469641	6471782	Joshi says Orange Soda Lounge Games.
6471902	6472302	There you go.
6472802	6474062	Orange Crush Lounge Games.
6474082	6476982	Oh my god, that would be another copyright infringement.
6477262	6478063	Like two at once.
6478103	6478583	Alright, anyway.
6478723	6479683	I know.
6479743	6482263	Moving on, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
6482323	6485844	Rice Princess, thanks for being here and ruining the show with your dry wit as always.
6486514	6487135	Your final thought.
6487215	6488275	Dry wit, what?
6489036	6494700	Well, I was thinking of this very serious, poignant matter.
6494920	6495620	It's about time.
6495780	6496121	Yeah.
6501144	6502125	Eddie, your final thought.
6504426	6505807	Hot tubs are cool.
6507068	6507448	Pervert.
6508709	6510270	DarkSakura, your final thought.
6510651	6511551	I hate people!
6512712	6514073	Loki, your final thought.
6514673	6515574	Blue mittens!
6516477	6517638	Loki, your final thought.
6518598	6522160	I guess reject false... Fuck the reject false icons.
6522540	6525461	Worship those false icons like never before.
6525881	6527462	Bow down to the golden cow.
6531544	6532765	Don't listen to Moses.
6532825	6534025	I've got a golden cow.
6536586	6537747	My final thought is
6538462	6539183	and Ammon Joy.
6540645	6543790	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.
6544030	6546233	Please leave us a five-star retune on iTunes.
6546534	6547836	Please leave us a dig.
6547896	6548617	What do we have to do?
6548777	6551441	I will send Rice Princess over there to make love to you if that's what it takes.
6552170	6553070	It's getting hot.
6553130	6556632	You should declare your love for Rice Princess in a five-star iTunes review.
6556812	6557892	Aw, you truly should.
6557912	6559933	Actually, I got a message from SpeedyF40.
6560133	6563855	It says, tell Rice Princess that I still have a crush on her because she sounds like a freak.
6565075	6565796	Aw, that's kind of scary.
6565816	6568317	There's going to be a love triangle going on here.
6568357	6568837	Oh, my God.
6568877	6569337	With who?
6569717	6569957	All right.
6570498	6571078	With Stacia.
6571098	6573039	Do you like farting, Speedy?
6573659	6574439	What?
6576120	6578421	Because you need to like that to be with Rice Princess.
6579167	6586270	Well, Rice Princess will choose who her heart belongs to based on who leaves the most five-star iTunes reviews.
6586310	6586890	There you go.
6587411	6588731	And who sends me golden wow.
6588931	6593633	No, in all seriousness, actually, remember what our new marketing director said.
6593914	6595974	Tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio.
6596014	6596735	That's all we ask.
6597075	6599736	And then if those two people tell two more people... Oh, my God.
6599796	6601157	Are you Ron Poupeel?
6601297	6604258	Like, if you tell someone, we'll give you a free food diet drink.
6604278	6605979	We'll throw in a free Am and Joy egg.
6606919	6607980	That's already been eaten.
6608000	6609380	I'll send you the wrapper.
6609640	6611181	I'll autograph it and put it on eBay.
6611201	6612782	It'll sell for billions.
6612802	6613462	It'll sell for nothing.
6613542	6613842	All right.
6613902	6617284	We really need to end the show now, so cue the outgoing music, please.
6617344	6620305	Cue, cue.
