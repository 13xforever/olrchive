[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:24,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for Part B of our podcast.

3
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:34,116
[SPEAKER_09]: If this is the first time you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, remember that we do broadcast in two parts because we tape live on Sunday nights for about three hours, or as tonight's going, maybe about four hours.

4
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:46,564
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some bonus stuff that you can only hear when you listen to us live or when you listen to us on our rebroadcast over at allgames.com, which is Mondays at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time and Tuesdays at 9 a.m.

5
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:48,825
[SPEAKER_09]: We like all games because it's this big...

6
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:49,749
[SPEAKER_09]: and many more.

7
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,722
[SPEAKER_01]: More rare games are going to make their way, I guess, to the DS.

8
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:33,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, probably not the case, but according to Microsoft's VP, Shane Kim, he spoke to 1UP and basically told them a cameo or Viva Pinata on DS makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways from a franchise perspective.

9
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:39,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fair to say we're going to continue to invest in Viva Pinata, but you probably won't see it on the PSP.

10
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:46,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say you probably won't see it on the DS either because that's still a competing system with them, I mean.

11
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,554
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems so weird to me.

12
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:52,276
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're basically saying people are assuming because of the fact he said that.

13
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:52,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

14
00:01:53,537 --> 00:02:07,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, and this just further lends that thing that Microsoft is secretly in bed with Nintendo, but they are so the bottom because Reggie just keeps, you know, regulating on Microsoft that, you know, no, we don't want to form a partnership with Microsoft.

15
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:10,048
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd rather you buy more of our games and more of our components.

16
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:20,020
[SPEAKER_09]: So Microsoft is totally being a submissive bottom in this relationship because now they're talking about, oh, but Nintendo, I'll totally put Viva Pinata inside you.

17
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

18
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:29,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just me?

19
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:35,593
[SPEAKER_01]: It would work, but first off, Viva Pinata, the graphics wouldn't look right.

20
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:36,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just another kind of,

21
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:41,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really a Pokemon type of game, but it's your breeding stuff.

22
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:42,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

23
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:48,647
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, maybe Microsoft should give Nintendo advice on internet play.

24
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:49,387
[SPEAKER_09]: You win.

25
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:51,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, seriously.

26
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:55,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandit says, hey Rare.

27
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:57,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm talking with my mouth full.

28
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:58,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do that.

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,850
[SPEAKER_09]: It's partly my show too.

30
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandit says, hey Rare, give me Killer Instinct already.

31
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:06,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I say that with a mouthful of donut.

32
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:09,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that, you get Banjo-Kazooie.

33
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:10,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Eww.

34
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:12,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Kazooie wasn't that bad.

35
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:13,388
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it was.

36
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:19,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike W. says, Major Nelson, Major Nelson, Major Nelson Hearts Nintendo.

37
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:21,293
[SPEAKER_09]: So does Trixie.

38
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:23,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember reading on one of Trixie's blogs on Xbox.

39
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:25,476
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea why I was reading Trixie's blog.

40
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:27,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I was bored on the internet and that's where I found myself.

41
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:32,261
[SPEAKER_09]: But, because whenever I hear Trixie, I think of the stripper in the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but never mind.

42
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:34,863
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm like, do you perform with the cast?

43
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:40,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, but Trixie, she wrote her Christmas list, and one of the things on the Christmas list was a Wii.

44
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:43,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I was like, aren't you guys supposed to be competitors?

45
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:49,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So Microsoft, again, being the submissive big old bottom.

46
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:51,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

47
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:53,304
[SPEAKER_13]: That's your thing.

48
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:58,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I say personally, though, that I'm actually really impressed at how the Xbox 360 just took off.

49
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,925
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, again, I'm more of a spectator because of the money.

50
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:09,168
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I mean, at the very beginning, having an Xbox was just, oh, you know, you have a console that freezes.

51
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:18,231
[SPEAKER_13]: And everybody's giving crap to all my friends who initially went out and bought an Xbox, and the 360 seems to be kicking some serious ass.

52
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:23,373
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, that seems to be exciting, and it's actually something that I enjoyed as well when I started to play it.

53
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:24,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Spamusement.

54
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:29,600
[SPEAKER_09]: So the spam email subject line was, are you man enough for this?

55
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:57,019
[SPEAKER_09]: And what it was, is it was an Xbox with a deep fryer attachment.

56
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:02,483
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was the problem with the original Xbox, is it was too butch.

57
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:06,847
[SPEAKER_09]: But the Xbox 360... And the controller was just too fucking big!

58
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:14,633
[SPEAKER_09]: The Xbox 360, you know, it's still butch, you know, it's not gay, but it's a little fruity.

59
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:15,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's okay.

60
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:17,815
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got like Viva Pinata.

61
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:19,617
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you go first.

62
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,334
[SPEAKER_13]: I was this close, actually, to getting my boyfriend the Xbox 360.

63
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:24,536
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm too good.

64
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,359
[SPEAKER_13]: I got my ex a PSP for Christmas.

65
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,650
[SPEAKER_13]: I was this close to actually getting my boyfriend a 360, because that's what he loves, because he loves the Xbox for Christmas, but...

66
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,655
[SPEAKER_13]: JV Mon sums it up perfectly.

67
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:36,656
[SPEAKER_13]: The 360 is metrosexual.

68
00:05:57,413 --> 00:06:08,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to, I hate going back to the, well no I don't, but not to go too much back to the gay issue, but I get a magazine called The Advocate, which is basically a gay and lesbian magazine specifically.

69
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:09,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that GLAAD's agenda?

70
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a gay gamer, I'm not the biggest fan of GLAAD, because sometimes they get their panties ruffled too easy.

71
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:32,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who it was, but they were talking about how video games are starting to bring more of that in, and they were talking, like Bully was one of them, Sims 2, but they talked about Gears of War, like the two main characters, like no one can convince me that those two characters are not boning each other.

72
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:39,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, look, one of the achievements is called I Wish I Knew How to Quit You, or like Dom Curious, I don't remember what it was called, something like that.

73
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:42,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, I thought it was like, I can't quit you, Dom, or something like that.

74
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,462
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of the achievements in Gears of War.

75
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:46,744
[SPEAKER_09]: There's subtleties there.

76
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:48,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Meg's giving me huge shit about it.

77
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,028
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, they are not!

78
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,470
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nothing major.

79
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:53,432
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just an LOL moment.

80
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:55,835
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not trying to make a statement or anything.

81
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:56,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh...

82
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:59,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Cliffy B is like secretly a gay supporter.

83
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he is.

84
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

85
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,981
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a video game.

86
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:04,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

87
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:07,925
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't tear away my boyfriend from Gears of War at Best Buy.

88
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:08,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that make him kind of gay?

89
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:10,366
[SPEAKER_14]: You've contaminated your microphone with gay.

90
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:14,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'll totally go for the guy that said he'd marry me for liking that adventure game.

91
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I got gay from Rob a long time ago with the Pepsi bong.

92
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:18,152
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow.

93
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,113
[SPEAKER_14]: At Golfland.

94
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:25,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm being asked by several people, please tell me you aren't a crab person.

95
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,633
[SPEAKER_09]: No, well, both of us, because we're both gay.

96
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:32,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you ever see that episode of South Park with the crab people?

97
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:33,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Queer Eye?

98
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

99
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we ever talk video games on this show?

100
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:43,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we do once in a while, and this is a very interesting sort of game that's coming to the DS.

101
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,681
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a new brand of toys in Japan called Treasure Gaust, and it's going to be coming to the DS.

102
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, get this.

103
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:54,783
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember how, like, Boktai used sunlight, and there was another game in Japan that used barcodes?

104
00:07:55,253 --> 00:07:56,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Take your DS to a power plant.

105
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:21,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Take it to a power plant.

106
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:25,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Or get a blacklight in your house because that thing will send that thing off the rockets.

107
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if a fridge magnet will fuck with this game.

108
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:30,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they have those stones that make noise?

109
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:32,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

110
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Treasure Gauss coming to the DS.

111
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, the DS now really does everything.

112
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's kind of cool, though, because it's like degaussing your monitor.

113
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:42,152
[SPEAKER_09]: It's certainly something new.

114
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:45,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here is something new, but not really.

115
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,954
[SPEAKER_14]: We get more Harvest Moon.

116
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:49,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh, award of the week.

117
00:08:50,856 --> 00:09:19,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Harvest Moon DS will be out on the 13th of April I know at least in the UK I'm not sure if that's also applying to the US because I got my information off of UK stuff however it's more cows and more sheep and you get tutorials on how to raise your animals and plant seeds and crops and make money on your farm fall asleep while playing a video game

118
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:23,454
[SPEAKER_14]: and have sex with Harvest Sprites and the Witch Princess.

119
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:23,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm awake.

120
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:25,655
[SPEAKER_14]: No, really.

121
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:28,117
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you can actually get married in the game.

122
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:31,580
[SPEAKER_14]: You have 25 villagers and you can go fishing.

123
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,982
[SPEAKER_01]: All they'll do is just nag you to fucking tend to the animals.

124
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:40,566
[SPEAKER_14]: You can probably, you know, hump the sheep or something.

125
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:45,310
[SPEAKER_09]: All they do is stay at home and watch Oprah while you're out milking the cow.

126
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,671
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a Harvest Moon sheep.

127
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:47,872
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.

128
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:47,972
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.

129
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:50,776
[SPEAKER_14]: He sleeps by my bed with Stitch.

130
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming Nerd says, I'm buying this game.

131
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:54,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Whee!

132
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,020
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

133
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:01,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, um, so... John Dorian says, I think Harvest Moon for the DS already came out.

134
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,866
[SPEAKER_09]: I think... I don't know if this is a new one.

135
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:04,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is a new one.

136
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:05,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

137
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:11,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's a new Harvest Moon game every year on every platform, so, you know, it's the same fucking thing every time.

138
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:13,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I'm not a big Harvest Moon fan, if you can't already tell.

139
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I find the game to be incredibly boring, yet I love Animal Crossing.

140
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,337
[SPEAKER_09]: So obviously, my taste in games is fucked.

141
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:22,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I admit it, okay?

142
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:24,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Evangelicals love Animal Crossing.

143
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Evangelicals love Animal Crossing?

144
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why.

145
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would Evangelicals... You should have seen the shit we were doing in Animal Crossing.

146
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:34,182
[SPEAKER_09]: I got one of my animals to always say, you cunt, after everything they said.

147
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:36,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I have a fish, you cunt?

148
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:41,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, like, we painted gay pride symbols and put them all over town.

149
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:44,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember the girl in my village who was their village lesbian?

150
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:47,948
[SPEAKER_09]: My Animal Crossing village was an evangelical nightmare.

151
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,645
[SPEAKER_14]: On my DS one, though, we had our village lesbian, and when she moved out, we cried.

152
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:52,545
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I remember that.

153
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:52,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.

154
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:54,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Because she moved to Julie's village.

155
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:55,688
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because I hit her with a bug net so much.

156
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:57,669
[SPEAKER_14]: She moved to Julie's village.

157
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,890
[SPEAKER_14]: And she was a PE teacher.

158
00:10:58,931 --> 00:10:59,931
[SPEAKER_14]: She had gym equipment.

159
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:00,312
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

160
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:01,252
[SPEAKER_09]: She had gym equipment in her house.

161
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:02,413
[SPEAKER_14]: She was such a lesbian.

162
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:05,836
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we made a little rainbow sign to be outside of her house.

163
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know why Animal Crossing is sick?

164
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:09,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we're talking about these people like they're real.

165
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:13,883
[SPEAKER_14]: You know you liked Olivia.

166
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,926
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one I think I got to say you cunt after everything.

167
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:23,739
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing funnier than getting video game characters to say shit and poop.

168
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:23,819
Yay!

169
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,701
[SPEAKER_14]: How about Pee Pee Kaka?

170
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:28,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

171
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:29,263
[SPEAKER_14]: I had one that said that.

172
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Capcom.

173
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:32,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're awesome.

174
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:40,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And they used to have a studio called Clover, which put out such games like Okami, Beautiful Joe, fun stuff like that.

175
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, you remember Clover went buh-bye.

176
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Dekki Kamiya

177
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:16,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And I probably butchered those names.

178
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,326
[SPEAKER_01]: But it should be interesting.

179
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:24,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we get some more original games, kind of like... Actually, they worked on... What was it?

180
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:25,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Gunhand?

181
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the name of that.

182
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:28,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Godhand, that's what it was.

183
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:30,612
[SPEAKER_01]: That was okay.

184
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:34,194
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, awesome.

185
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:35,915
[SPEAKER_01]: More studios making more games.

186
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:44,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I have, on another completely different tangent, I have the news that might save PlayStation 3.

187
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:46,547
[SPEAKER_09]: And here it is.

188
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:59,932
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a rumor going around that there are, because based off reports from Japan, that the head of the Sony Financial Division is suggesting that a PlayStation 3 price cut in 2007 may be on the way.

189
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:11,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it seems like there's a story about this like every other week, but this one's really been circulating around the different blogs, so we hope there's a little bit of truth to it, but the honest end of it is, if there is a price cut coming, it's probably not until Christmas.

190
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:15,544
[SPEAKER_09]: because they'll try to lie to fire under PS3 sales.

191
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:19,745
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to because Halo 3 is going to be a big problem.

192
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:32,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say if they want to be smart, they'll cut the price of the PlayStation 3 the same day as the Halo 3 comes out.

193
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,310
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be the best thing ever.

194
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:35,651
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what happens.

195
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:45,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, as for other things that we're seeing happening, and I really wish we weren't seeing this happen, there's an Aqua Teen Hunger Force game on the PS2.

196
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,146
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is what you get for drinking beer milkshakes.

197
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:51,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

198
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:53,069
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a golfing game.

199
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:53,709
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

200
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,532
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just... Extreme combat golf, they call it.

201
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:00,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Whose story is this?

202
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just hoping.

203
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:03,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

204
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:04,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I say something?

205
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, tell us more about the game, Jamie.

206
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:06,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Go right ahead.

207
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I say something completely random first?

208
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

209
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie likes to do that to my stories.

210
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:25,207
[SPEAKER_09]: This has nothing to do with gaming at all, but you know how in Rocky Horror Picture Show at the end, you always have, like, if you ever go see it live in the theater, when Riff Raff and Magenta come back into the, they're sometimes dressed up as famous couples or some type of coupling.

211
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:30,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, maybe they'll come, like, I remember one time when I actually performed as Riff Raff, we came out as the characters from Brokeback Mountain.

212
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:32,425
[SPEAKER_09]: and, you know, just like couples like that.

213
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:38,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, last night, they came out in these giant cardboard cutouts of Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

214
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,929
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was the best gold scene I'd ever seen in my life.

215
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:42,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Dinner is papayas!

216
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Something like that.

217
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:59,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, that random moment was brought to you by... I was just sort of in shock because I'm like, it's bad enough that it's Aqua Teen Hunger Force, but they have to just completely turn the state in my heart and making it combat golf with sawed-off shotguns.

218
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:05,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Midway, stop taking the LSD, please.

219
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:07,818
[SPEAKER_14]: You are not a hero.

220
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,099
[SPEAKER_14]: You cannot tell the future through Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

221
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:13,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Lay off the drugs.

222
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Next, please.

223
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to read some comments from chat real quick.

224
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to, let's see, back to the PlayStation 3 story.

225
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:24,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have T says, PlayStation 3 needs a price cut.

226
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:26,922
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only way that it might become a real threat to Microsoft.

227
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:29,963
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says, Aqua Teen Hunger Force game.

228
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:32,275
[SPEAKER_09]: The only game that won't be in Boston.

229
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:36,038
[SPEAKER_09]: To which WB Bulldogs tags along to that.

230
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:37,519
[SPEAKER_09]: The Boston Scare was a bunch of bullshit.

231
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Media blowing things out of proportion.

232
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:43,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Got the show a lot of visibility, although I hear it didn't help in the ratings.

233
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:44,425
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too bad.

234
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,167
[SPEAKER_09]: The ratings are doing pretty good as it is.

235
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:49,629
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yeah, the show is doing fine as it is, so what can you do?

236
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:50,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

237
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:50,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool!

238
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Mikotov's going to let me borrow Hotel Dusk.

239
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:53,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been wanting to play this.

240
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:56,294
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean book.

241
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:57,796
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't have the game.

242
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,077
[SPEAKER_09]: He's loaning it to me.

243
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, game list!

244
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,923
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every time you...

245
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I'm on this frickin' show, you say that, Rob.

246
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single time.

247
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,506
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't mean anything, I swear.

248
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:05,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart... Broken.

249
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:08,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, I get to read a story now.

250
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,110
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

251
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:14,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, apparently the team behind Ico is working on a brand new title for the PS3.

252
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:19,776
[SPEAKER_01]: People are hoping that it's a brand new version of Shadow Colossus or even Ico.

253
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:20,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

254
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:26,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's probably going to be something original that looks yet very similar to both those two games.

255
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:31,221
[SPEAKER_01]: So, no word on what it is, but we know that they're working on something.

256
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:36,262
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something coming soon.

257
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:38,243
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta love gaming news like that.

258
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:43,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Something is coming.

259
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:48,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Something is coming to the PlayStation 3 and it's got a big schnauzer.

260
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:50,486
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Q-Bert, you perverts.

261
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Qbert's coming to the PlayStation 3 on February 22nd.

262
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, that's this week.

263
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,201
[SPEAKER_09]: $4.99, undercutting the cost of the average Microsoft game by one cent.

264
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:02,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, Sony.

265
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,883
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, Qbert will have the online leaderboards.

266
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:08,503
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be in 720p.

267
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:15,565
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently players will be fighting against each other to see who can be the supreme noser.

268
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's the number one person on the leaderboard is the supreme noser.

269
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:21,652
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

270
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:27,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Q-Bert jumped the shark when they had the Q-Bert cartoon, although that was kind of cool.

271
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,654
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do love the Q-Bert game.

272
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:35,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love the fact that Sony can't really say anything about their PlayStation Network right now because there's nothing on it!

273
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:37,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing!

274
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,357
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing on there.

275
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:41,518
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like six games and a few demos and that's it.

276
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:46,760
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, the fucking Nintendo Network has more stuff on it than the Sony Network does.

277
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:48,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.

278
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:49,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Put out some more shit.

279
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:53,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if this is stuff that's already been on the 360 or whatever.

280
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:54,787
[SPEAKER_01]: More games.

281
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:55,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

282
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:56,949
[SPEAKER_01]: More demos.

283
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, ooh, full auto 2 demo.

284
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:01,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Only months after the game came out.

285
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:02,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray.

286
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:02,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

287
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:03,734
[SPEAKER_01]: The game still sucks.

288
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,456
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.

289
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:07,497
[SPEAKER_01]: They just need more shit.

290
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:10,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Qbert is not filling the void that they need.

291
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,061
[SPEAKER_01]: More original stuff.

292
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:14,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And no PSP ports.

293
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop it with the goddamn PSP ports.

294
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:24,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, why don't we move away from Sony's stinky poop pile of a camp and go to the Nintendo World?

295
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:26,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Although this is actually pretty poopy, too.

296
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:34,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Cooking Mama Cook-Off has actually been pushed back.

297
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:34,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

298
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:36,588
[SPEAKER_14]: In Europe.

299
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:39,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Europe.

300
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,013
[SPEAKER_14]: The original release date was March 29th.

301
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:43,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it's pushed back to May 10th.

302
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,656
[SPEAKER_14]: They are not listing a reason.

303
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:48,840
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really crappy, isn't it?

304
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry, Europe.

305
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Mama will fix it.

306
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:54,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Had to, sorry.

307
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:56,805
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you, Europe.

308
00:19:57,745 --> 00:19:58,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though we don't like the band.

309
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:12,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, you know, news of Cooking Mama getting delayed, even if it doesn't directly affect us here in the U.S., we feel your angst, our listeners overseas.

310
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:15,616
[SPEAKER_09]: We feel your angst, and therefore we dedicate this podcast

311
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:18,648
[SPEAKER_09]: FUs of the week segment to our overseas listeners.

312
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,213
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, start us off with the angst.

313
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:33,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you to accidents.

314
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:43,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I banged my wrist into a big metal pole today and I have this big bruise and now I have this big swollen scald on my hand from your freaking T, Rob.

315
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,680
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't have to.

316
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:48,784
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was yummy, thank you.

317
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:51,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't buy it.

318
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.

319
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:59,670
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, um, F you to having to pay $800 to buy a massage table.

320
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:01,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki!

321
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:12,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't really have anything other than, I guess, um, F you to people that can't, you know, abide by street dates.

322
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,478
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that's a bit, you know, hypocritical, but yeah.

323
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:27,411
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exception, because you see, the rules state that you cannot sell it, rent it, or make it available to the public in that form.

324
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:29,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Playing it is not on there.

325
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:33,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Playing it is okie-dokie, so that's all I did is play it.

326
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:36,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't sell it or rent it, so I'm off scuffery.

327
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:42,878
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, other people though, even people that should know better, like some of the comp USA's and EB games out there,

328
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:46,878
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big fucking sticker on it that says do not sell before 2.20.

329
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a dumb fuck.

330
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're not getting paid that much money to do your job.

331
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:56,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, honestly, no one gives a shit if you have the game, you know, days before everybody else.

332
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:59,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's going to forget it, you know, down the line anyway.

333
00:21:59,747 --> 00:22:01,708
[SPEAKER_01]: So, who gives a crap?

334
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:05,010
[SPEAKER_01]: But I need more people to buy this game so I can play with them online.

335
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to be fun.

336
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:10,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking about it, but $60 is a lot to spend.

337
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look how much I played Gears of War.

338
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:13,250
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.

339
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,070
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is fun.

340
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:14,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll think about it.

341
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:16,972
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to bring your copy over second place.

342
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:18,913
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

343
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,574
[SPEAKER_09]: My view of the week goes to my voice, because I'm losing it again, and that sucks.

344
00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:30,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, for those who say I talk too much on this show, do realize I'm used to talking all day and getting paid for it for a living in the teaching world.

345
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:35,401
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, losing my voice and having to go to my day job tomorrow is going to kind of suck.

346
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:37,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Luckily, I could just give my class a test.

347
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:38,883
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm off, Rob.

348
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:40,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you suck.

349
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:43,827
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be at home enjoying my day off for you.

350
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:44,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

351
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:46,549
[SPEAKER_09]: You have fun with that, bitch.

352
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:47,169
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

353
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I love you.

354
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:51,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's that?

355
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:52,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Your inaugural FUs of the week.

356
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:53,574
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want to angst on?

357
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:55,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, I get to break my FU of the week theory.

358
00:22:56,356 --> 00:23:01,300
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny because, as my friends like to say after work, I love to get my hate on.

359
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,943
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm having such a good time being up here up north of NorCal Rules.

360
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,311
[SPEAKER_13]: and SoCal's Rules, even though I'm an LA native.

361
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:13,973
[SPEAKER_13]: But my fuck you of the week is so funny because I hate, I hate, I love to get my hate on.

362
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Let it all out, baby, let it all out.

363
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:17,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Let it all out.

364
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:18,755
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, seriously, what can I say?

365
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:26,398
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess my F you of the week, you go to my ex-boyfriend, not because I'm bitter, okay, I am a little bit, but because he has every reason.

366
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:27,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Which one?

367
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:29,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, not him.

368
00:23:29,587 --> 00:23:32,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, because I was going to say that one you have never seen.

369
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:32,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, F.U.

370
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:35,869
[SPEAKER_13]: of the week to him, too, but David, a.k.a.

371
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:40,871
[SPEAKER_13]: S.Kalian, big gamer nerd, and he likes to make anime music videos.

372
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:41,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh-oh.

373
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:42,772
[SPEAKER_12]: What if he listens to the show?

374
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:44,252
[SPEAKER_13]: He probably does.

375
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:45,512
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I'm doing it.

376
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:47,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, boy.

377
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:52,575
[SPEAKER_13]: And instead of going out, which is okay, because I would pay for everything anyway, and I got on the PSP, because you know why?

378
00:23:52,595 --> 00:23:54,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm the best ex-girlfriend ever.

379
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,396
[SPEAKER_13]: But we used to play...

380
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,002
[SPEAKER_13]: And last but not least, some lesbian FUs from Chris.

381
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:29,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two quick ones.

382
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:30,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be too long.

383
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:37,649
[SPEAKER_02]: One, F you to the Scientology Center for fucking roping my father into it.

384
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave my father alone.

385
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,171
[SPEAKER_02]: He's old, he's bitter, and he has money.

386
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:42,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Knock the fuck off.

387
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sick of it.

388
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:47,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to the week to me.

389
00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:50,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Because... You're awesome.

390
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:55,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but... I don't... I wish I could do more...

391
00:24:57,233 --> 00:25:01,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I rant about something every week around here with Meg D, but she lives in Wisconsin.

392
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:04,009
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes to school full time.

393
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:09,243
[SPEAKER_02]: She's at work part-time and she's got ASUN coming up where she's being in costume and stuff like that.

394
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:11,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's just so stressed out.

395
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:15,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And I F you to me for not being able to do something to help her more.

396
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:17,249
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

397
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:20,492
[SPEAKER_09]: She's obviously got a gal who loves her very much.

398
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:23,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people in this world are not that lucky.

399
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:25,416
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what you can give.

400
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:27,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish I could do more for her.

401
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:29,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

402
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:49,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

403
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,041
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll enjoy that.

404
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:55,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Somehow we went from I love my girlfriend so much to fuck you, Maisie.

405
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you right in your ear hole.

406
00:25:58,287 --> 00:25:59,108
[SPEAKER_09]: She knows I love her.

407
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:00,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought her a pink leather collar.

408
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Maisie, too.

409
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:03,592
[SPEAKER_09]: She's great.

410
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:04,753
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

411
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:08,396
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one last fuck you of the week, and that's to Gears of War for hypnotizing my boyfriend.

412
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:11,158
[SPEAKER_13]: He never wants to leave the fucking best buy.

413
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:13,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Gears of War.

414
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:14,541
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.

415
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:16,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone else?

416
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:17,104
[SPEAKER_13]: I need a new boyfriend.

417
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:17,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Any volunteers?

418
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,005
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a popular game.

419
00:26:20,806 --> 00:26:26,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't swing that way, but I'll pose in pictures and stuff so you can tell your family.

420
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:28,412
[SPEAKER_09]: What, at Disneyland?

421
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:28,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

422
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you to death, but you're gay and you act it!

423
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:33,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not gay!

424
00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:35,103
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?

425
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:37,124
[SPEAKER_09]: How can anyone mistake you for her husband?

426
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

427
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:38,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm done.

428
00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:01,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to gaming news.

429
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:02,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they couldn't hear him talk in the picture.

430
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,743
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, on my MySpace, Chris left me a comment where I'm holding the gay lightsaber from Disneyland.

431
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,624
[SPEAKER_14]: I had it in my big one.

432
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:16,945
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, use the gay force, Rob.

433
00:27:17,025 --> 00:27:20,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I need to add that to my pictures now that I have 300 pictures, so I'm going to do that.

434
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:21,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, sorry.

435
00:27:21,828 --> 00:27:22,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming news.

436
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:23,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody, somebody, help.

437
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:25,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so...

438
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:32,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all the retarded shit that come out for gamers, this has to be up there with some of them.

439
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Headshot, the energy bar.

440
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:47,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you too can buy a fucking energy bar called Headshot and be uber cool because you eat fucking energy bars that have to do with gaming while you're gaming.

441
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, you're fucking awesome.

442
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:54,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, while you're at it, I want you to wash that Headshot down with some balls.

443
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:58,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that sounds like fun!

444
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:04,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, Jamie, I know I'm your husband, but can I drink some balls?

445
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:09,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to get hate mail from GLAAD, even though I'm gay.

446
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:10,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that ironic?

447
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,319
[SPEAKER_14]: We should tell Mr. Spanky about that.

448
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:14,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

449
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, headshot.

450
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's something else.

451
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and that was the other thing.

452
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,121
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe...

453
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:29,855
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this website, UncommonLoot.com, that was running the story about that.

454
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,977
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks so awful.

455
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably tastes like ass, too.

456
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people like the taste of ass.

457
00:28:41,123 --> 00:28:42,044
[SPEAKER_14]: You like ass?

458
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:43,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we have the drink for you.

459
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:47,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't there a drink on English.com or something that was A-S-S-E or something?

460
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:50,090
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a type of candy.

461
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:52,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Pocari Sweat's actually really good.

462
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:54,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what was I going to say?

463
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:54,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

464
00:28:56,316 --> 00:29:00,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Rob D in chat said, if Rob and Jamie were married, one of them would be dead by now.

465
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:02,981
[SPEAKER_09]: So true.

466
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:03,662
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be Rob.

467
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:04,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So true.

468
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:05,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, really?

469
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:06,924
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

470
00:29:07,925 --> 00:29:21,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's get into some PC gaming news, because I know it's been a pretty interesting show tonight with some very random stuff, but there's nothing more hardcore than PC gaming, because seriously, PC gamer fans are like, they're like, fuming at the mouth hardcore.

471
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:22,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

472
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:25,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Mist Online went live this week.

473
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:28,204
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a game a lot of folks have been like, ooh, even Marissa's casting it.

474
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,705
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Mist is not dead.

475
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:34,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Through the service GameTap, you can play Mist Online.

476
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:38,108
[SPEAKER_09]: It's $9.95 a month for GameTap, and you get access to like hundreds of games, not just this.

477
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:41,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And it launched on February 15th.

478
00:29:41,969 --> 00:29:50,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, right now, it's only available to GameTap subscribers, but apparently they're going to make the game available as like a direct download in other countries.

479
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:51,729
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

480
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:20,866
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I actually really want to check this out.

481
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:26,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to really try to play this and review it for next week's show because I keep saying, oh, I've got to play Salmon Max.

482
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I really need to spend some quality time with GameTap.

483
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:28,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Salmon Max, yay!

484
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:31,478
[SPEAKER_09]: But I keep going back to WoW because it's crack.

485
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Salmon Max, yay!

486
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:35,182
[SPEAKER_14]: War crack.

487
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:35,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

488
00:30:35,742 --> 00:30:36,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

489
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, just a little bit of information.

490
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:45,547
[SPEAKER_14]: For fans of Gears of War who have a PC, it's eventually going to be on the PC.

491
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:54,154
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually confirmed by Epic's VP, Mark Raine, said that it's not just a rumor, it's going to happen, just not soon.

492
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:55,876
[SPEAKER_14]: He just said it's inevitable.

493
00:30:57,297 --> 00:30:58,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's not a really big surprise.

494
00:30:58,838 --> 00:31:01,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, it's one of Microsoft's biggest, if they want

495
00:31:01,604 --> 00:31:04,365
[SPEAKER_09]: More people to come over to the PC bandwagon.

496
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not put something out for those that don't have the 360?

497
00:31:07,105 --> 00:31:09,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Gears of War is a huge title.

498
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:10,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Makes perfect sense.

499
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:12,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why it took them this long to simply acknowledge it.

500
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:20,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so there's going to be a brand new action-oriented role-playing game coming out to the PC.

501
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:26,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Silverfall by Atari and Monte Cristo Games is finally gone gold.

502
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,849
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scheduled to be released on March 20th.

503
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:31,630
[SPEAKER_01]: and will retail for $39.95.

504
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:37,596
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually looks pretty cool, kind of a little fantasy mixed with technology type of role-playing game.

505
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:39,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's kind of like a Final Fantasy.

506
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:45,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, the cover has boobs on it, so you gotta buy it because of the boobies.

507
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:47,484
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think, Jamie?

508
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:48,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see.

509
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:54,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Not bad.

510
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,691
[SPEAKER_14]: She probably has back problems.

511
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Glory's, Glory's, Boobs!

512
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:24,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you have it.

513
00:32:25,306 --> 00:32:27,948
[SPEAKER_09]: So where the Wii does not have a camera, now you're going to get this on the Xbox 360.

514
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,108
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be interesting.

515
00:32:29,128 --> 00:32:30,969
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to work fantastic.

516
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:31,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

517
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Those camera games are not that great.

518
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like the eye toy.

519
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:44,995
[SPEAKER_09]: But Rayman's Raving Rabbids doesn't exactly have a lot of, like, I would think in translating some of those games, there's not a lot of motion-intensive stuff in that game.

520
00:32:45,015 --> 00:32:46,156
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

521
00:32:47,536 --> 00:32:49,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I can't imagine there would be that much motion.

522
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,518
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of motion going on in that game.

523
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:54,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

524
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:55,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget it.

525
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Just don't buy it.

526
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,623
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horrible game.

527
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:00,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'll do that.

528
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do that.

529
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:03,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

530
00:33:04,507 --> 00:33:08,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go on to DarkSakura's website of the week.

531
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to see if there was good chat comments.

532
00:33:11,252 --> 00:33:12,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry if I sounded sidetracked.

533
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:13,434
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they're talking about breasts.

534
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:14,414
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all talking about boobs.

535
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:19,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Although, I do have to say, holy shit, it's boobs get in the car from GS68.

536
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,071
[SPEAKER_14]: My rebuttal to that was going to the Boobs BRB.

537
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:33,337
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, I also want to hear your rebuttal to the website of the week, because every week DarkSakura surfs the website up and down and left and right to find her favorite website.

538
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:36,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it will be Doctor Who related this week.

539
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,120
[SPEAKER_09]: We will soon find out.

540
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

541
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, she does surf the website up and down.

542
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:43,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I say the web... Shut up.

543
00:33:43,864 --> 00:33:46,465
[SPEAKER_14]: The website of the week is the Orange Ons Radio Forums.

544
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:47,446
No.

545
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:47,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

546
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:50,006
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Rob, stop the music.

547
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:53,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop the music.

548
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:56,353
[SPEAKER_14]: The website of the week is very personal to me.

549
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:58,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Very important.

550
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:04,742
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think that we're forgetting the presence of greatness in our lives.

551
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:08,947
[SPEAKER_14]: We should all bow down and pay homage to our Lord and Master.

552
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:33,819
[SPEAKER_14]: The Flying Spaghetti Monster Oh my god, yes So the site dedicated to our noodley lord master I am a pastafari and I must confess Blessed be his noodley goodness, ramen The site is What the fuck happened to this show?

553
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, what fucking show am I on?

554
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:39,584
[SPEAKER_14]: In the name of the noodle

555
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,664
[SPEAKER_14]: I love carbohydrates.

556
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:44,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Carbohydrates are so good.

557
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:53,471
[SPEAKER_14]: The site is www.venganza.org for a little bit of history.

558
00:34:55,332 --> 00:35:04,177
[SPEAKER_14]: The great one was discovered through a series of detections along the same lines as intelligent design.

559
00:35:05,218 --> 00:35:09,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And if intelligent design can't exist, why can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster?

560
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:15,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Just for a brief commercial for Pastafarianism, our heaven has a beer volcano and a stripper factory.

561
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:31,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So I recommend that everybody, or just worship the IPU, whatever, just go visit the site and soon you will become one of us.

562
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:36,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, hey, if, you know, Scientology exists, why can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster exist?

563
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:43,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, there's actually a million dollar prize if you can prove that the Flying Spaghetti Monster does not exist.

564
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:44,636
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no way to do it.

565
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:45,157
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

566
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:48,559
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, there's tons of photographic evidence on the site.

567
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,039
Yeah, like drawings.

568
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,001
[SPEAKER_14]: So... No, there's real life pictures.

569
00:35:53,041 --> 00:36:02,286
[SPEAKER_09]: If we go out to dinner at the Olive Garden, and I decide I don't like my food, because Olive Garden's food does taste a little bit, you know... It's an insult to Italians.

570
00:36:02,446 --> 00:36:02,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I...

571
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:04,629
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

572
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:28,927
[SPEAKER_13]: This has the best Valentine on it.

573
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:30,727
[SPEAKER_13]: It says, I love you, but you must die.

574
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:35,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, the best part about Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is that we have flimsy moral standards.

575
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:39,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I get gay married in Pastafarian?

576
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

577
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't you be ordained in Pastafarian?

578
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:44,012
[SPEAKER_14]: You can be ordained in anything.

579
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:45,692
[SPEAKER_14]: God bless Pastafarian.

580
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:46,232
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

581
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:48,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a registered minister in California.

582
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that from an episode of South Park?

583
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:56,434
[SPEAKER_14]: By the end of March, I will be an ordained minister of Pastafarianism.

584
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:57,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

585
00:36:57,095 --> 00:37:03,178
[SPEAKER_09]: This was in an episode of South Park where Mrs. Garrison says something about the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

586
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:05,799
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember this distinctly.

587
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:10,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It came about when someone was trying... The whole thing with the... Intelligent design.

588
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:11,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Intelligent design.

589
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:16,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, God invented the Earth and that kind of thing, and they're trying to teach it in schools.

590
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:17,785
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that's bullshit.

591
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:18,525
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not science.

592
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:20,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you may believe, it's not science.

593
00:37:20,993 --> 00:37:21,954
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not science.

594
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:23,215
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing to back it up.

595
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:29,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So these guys said, well, shit, we might as well have a pasta creature that can fly around and, you know, has a beer volcano in his head.

596
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,243
[SPEAKER_14]: And they use the same type of disjointed argument, the intelligent design.

597
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:40,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time you talk about a spaghetti monster, I think about Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs.

598
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:40,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

599
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:42,110
[SPEAKER_14]: He ate himself.

600
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,333
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually think that Pizza the Hut is one of the avatars of his noodley goodness.

601
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:50,497
[SPEAKER_14]: It was fully inspired, I think.

602
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:52,985
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a funny site.

603
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:53,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Go see it.

604
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:54,306
[SPEAKER_14]: God damn it.

605
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:58,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been touched by the noodley appendage.

606
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:00,549
[SPEAKER_14]: My heart is open.

607
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:07,772
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be changing the name of the show from Orange Lounge Radio Video Game Radio to Orange Lounge Radio from what the fuck ever.

608
00:38:09,273 --> 00:38:09,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Rob.

609
00:38:09,973 --> 00:38:10,493
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's alright.

610
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:10,833
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny.

611
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:13,654
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alright.

612
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:14,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week was just as bad.

613
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:19,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks in chat seem to be digging it, so whatever.

614
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,558
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they're happy, Rob.

615
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:23,609
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they're happy.

616
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,850
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, as long as the masses are pleased.

617
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, we can't talk about video games all day long.

618
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you have to have a life outside of games.

619
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:32,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

620
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:34,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Or else when will you ever get an orgasm?

621
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:35,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

622
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:36,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Whee!

623
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:36,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Whee!

624
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:39,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I found... I'm not going to say that on air.

625
00:38:39,793 --> 00:38:41,413
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are going to get back into some gaming news.

626
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say that on air.

627
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:43,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we?

628
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:44,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, yes?

629
00:38:45,374 --> 00:38:46,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, if someone gives me a microphone.

630
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:54,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so the wonderful game that I've been playing, Crackdown, it only has 900 assuming points.

631
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It is missing 100 of them.

632
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:56,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

633
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:58,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone pause.

634
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:04,874
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tragic news, but they are coming later on in a free downloadable thing.

635
00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:09,235
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're going to be doing for the last 100 points, well, they don't really know yet.

636
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:11,396
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're doing is watching how people play the game,

637
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:12,708
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

638
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:42,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there is a lobby in this game.

639
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:14,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Loki likes Crackdown a whole lot, but there's only a few things I can think of that are even better than Crackdown.

640
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki must agree.

641
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:17,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of them would be zombies.

642
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,363
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's really... Hell yeah, I love zombies.

643
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:22,264
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only really one thing... What?

644
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:23,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki disagrees.

645
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:24,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Zombies are not better than Crackdown?

646
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:24,885
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're not.

647
00:40:25,085 --> 00:40:25,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay.

648
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:26,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Crack is better than Crackdown.

649
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:27,386
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you're wrong.

650
00:40:27,446 --> 00:40:27,846
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

651
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:33,990
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only one thing better than zombies, believe it or not, and that would be Hideo Kojima.

652
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,831
[SPEAKER_09]: And would you believe...

653
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:44,015
[SPEAKER_09]: That the meeting of this awesomeness, these two worlds of awesome, could be in the near future.

654
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:52,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Hideo Kojima spoke to Edge Magazine and said the following, quote, of course Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid, blah, blah, blah.

655
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:55,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, the zombie idea I have is a bit different.

656
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:58,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine a large town where half the inhabitants are zombies.

657
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Users would subscribe, get inside the town, and get bitten.

658
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:05,147
[SPEAKER_09]: At that stage, they become undead and can't control their character.

659
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:07,267
[SPEAKER_09]: All they can do is modify the camera angles.

660
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:10,648
[SPEAKER_09]: They would see their character attacking humans and have to pay to just watch.

661
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:15,869
[SPEAKER_09]: The only way they could end it is by opening another account, hunting themselves down, and killing themselves.

662
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:19,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the problem is that your second character can get bitten as well.

663
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't this already done in a Resident Evil game?

664
00:41:22,531 --> 00:41:24,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I think of Infected for PSP.

665
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:29,312
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there was, I want to say a Resident Evil game that was played online.

666
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:29,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Outbreak?

667
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:31,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it might have been Outbreak.

668
00:41:31,983 --> 00:41:34,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Hideo Kojima Adventures in Nudie Island Half The Residence Hot Naked Chicks

669
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:02,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?

670
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:09,365
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have people subscribing four times just to have four different people in this fucking island.

671
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:14,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell ya, that is gonna be better than any fucking zombie game ever.

672
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:15,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Beauty and the Geek MMO?

673
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:16,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what happens?

674
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:24,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get bitten by the naked chicks, you know, if you're into that kind of thing, then you turn into another naked chick or something.

675
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:29,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't the downside, though, that half of those quote-unquote naked chicks are men playing as naked chicks?

676
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:32,792
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be me.

677
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:35,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Girls don't play video games.

678
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:37,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I always play women in MMOs, always.

679
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:44,038
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, I don't know, the naked chicks would be only controlled by AI, so it'd never be men playing.

680
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:46,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so you're never actually having real sex, ever.

681
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:49,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter, you're never having real sex in this game anyways.

682
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,543
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want real sex, go and fucking get a woman.

683
00:42:52,463 --> 00:42:57,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Festering Rash in our chat, which I believe is just DMN under a different name, says, Loki, it's called Second Life.

684
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:00,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Touche!

685
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:26,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Not lesbians.

686
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:27,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Chris.

687
00:43:27,928 --> 00:43:31,010
[SPEAKER_09]: But, like, you know, hardcore, like, guy-on-guy action.

688
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:33,071
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I said Chris.

689
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:35,272
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not Shane.

690
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:36,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry you're here.

691
00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:38,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

692
00:43:39,175 --> 00:43:40,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I love one-sided conversations on the radio.

693
00:43:41,736 --> 00:43:42,336
[SPEAKER_09]: So professional.

694
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:43,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

695
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:44,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Shall we move on?

696
00:43:45,858 --> 00:43:46,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

697
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:47,399
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

698
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I have better things to do.

699
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,861
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

700
00:43:53,243 --> 00:43:54,804
[SPEAKER_14]: For everybody who was...

701
00:43:55,831 --> 00:44:00,393
[SPEAKER_14]: into Amplitude who played Amplitude Online.

702
00:44:01,454 --> 00:44:05,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Sony is giving the online server the boot right at the ass.

703
00:44:06,316 --> 00:44:11,278
[SPEAKER_14]: The Amplitude online server is going away.

704
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:15,460
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be, I believe actually was it down now?

705
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,541
[SPEAKER_14]: It went off on Sunday, right?

706
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:20,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I think today was the last hurrah.

707
00:44:21,683 --> 00:44:23,805
[SPEAKER_14]: 7pm Eastern Time, so it's gone already.

708
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Aww, that's sad, kinda.

709
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:31,190
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so sad that a game that's a few years old loses its online content.

710
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy a new game!

711
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:36,133
[SPEAKER_09]: How about they make one as good as Amplitude?

712
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,254
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

713
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:38,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me Guitar Hero Online.

714
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:41,837
[SPEAKER_09]: You jerk.

715
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:44,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care if Marissa hates Guitar Hero, I'd play it.

716
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked Amplitude and I did play it online.

717
00:44:48,842 --> 00:44:49,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, not

718
00:44:49,864 --> 00:44:52,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Not in two years, but lately I have, Chris.

719
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this is not the Let's Cry About Rob Not Getting Laid show.

720
00:44:58,249 --> 00:44:58,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guess what?

721
00:44:58,969 --> 00:44:59,149
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

722
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:10,836
[SPEAKER_01]: If you thought that Gran Turismo HD was an awesome preview of what Gran Turismo 5 may be someday, whenever the fuck it comes out, well, guess what?

723
00:45:11,236 --> 00:45:16,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is coming out later this year, and it's supposed to be

724
00:45:17,503 --> 00:45:20,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet another fucking demo of what Gran Turismo 5 is going to be.

725
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:22,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurrah.

726
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:29,791
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually they were saying that if, I think the original Gran Turismo 4 prologue, you actually have to buy that.

727
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:33,273
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

728
00:45:33,393 --> 00:45:35,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, another fucking demo of Gran Turismo.

729
00:45:35,454 --> 00:45:35,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

730
00:45:35,954 --> 00:45:36,815
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one sucked.

731
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:38,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like it.

732
00:45:38,656 --> 00:45:39,256
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one?

733
00:45:39,577 --> 00:45:40,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not going to download it.

734
00:45:41,378 --> 00:45:42,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Gran Turismo 5?

735
00:45:42,518 --> 00:45:43,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not going to buy it.

736
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,561
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hooray.

737
00:45:49,178 --> 00:45:55,079
[SPEAKER_09]: James Patrick in chat commenting on the MMO thing says, Mass Effect will probably have gay romance.

738
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:56,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Sky looking forward to that?

739
00:45:56,799 --> 00:46:02,560
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because as I said earlier, I always play chicks in MMOs because everybody's nicer to you when you're a chick in an MMO.

740
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:04,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to do a lesbian thing.

741
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:05,201
[SPEAKER_09]: That's gross.

742
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:07,461
Yeah, World of Warcraft people.

743
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:09,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but first of all, fuck you.

744
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:11,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Second of all... Right now?

745
00:46:12,422 --> 00:46:13,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right now, Rob.

746
00:46:14,943 --> 00:46:15,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Punch fans back on.

747
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:20,526
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think that's a part of the history of the internet, because my father...

748
00:46:45,029 --> 00:46:51,090
[SPEAKER_13]: I almost want to make a gay.com account right now impersonating as a woman I'll put Chris's picture as my profile or something

749
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:15,027
[SPEAKER_09]: and go into a chat room and put, hey, lezzies.

750
00:47:15,848 --> 00:47:16,949
See what happens.

751
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:27,296
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to do that for my ex-boyfriend, who is so totally gay, as an April Fool's joke, put his profile and his address and stuff.

752
00:47:27,316 --> 00:47:28,217
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so wrong.

753
00:47:29,177 --> 00:47:31,979
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs help admitting his gayness.

754
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, okay.

755
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,499
[SPEAKER_14]: This show is very gay today, I'm sorry.

756
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,380
[SPEAKER_14]: The first step is admitting you're gay.

757
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,120
[SPEAKER_09]: We already did that.

758
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:06,515
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is only local in the United States and Canada, meaning that's where it's only toll free.

759
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:13,957
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are abroad in another country, we encourage you to download Skype and call us on our username, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

760
00:48:14,397 --> 00:48:15,758
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all going to call in for Marissa.

761
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,338
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what happens.

762
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the first call, boys and girls.

763
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

764
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

765
00:48:24,341 --> 00:48:25,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I not actually pick up a call?

766
00:48:25,521 --> 00:48:25,801
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

767
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:27,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

768
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:27,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

769
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:30,573
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

770
00:48:58,973 --> 00:48:59,333
[SPEAKER_09]: DT?

771
00:49:00,733 --> 00:49:01,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Say no.

772
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:02,514
[SPEAKER_09]: My husband will hunt you down.

773
00:49:02,574 --> 00:49:02,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of.

774
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:03,794
[SPEAKER_09]: He says kind of.

775
00:49:04,134 --> 00:49:04,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

776
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:06,095
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

777
00:49:06,295 --> 00:49:07,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Dan will step on you.

778
00:49:07,395 --> 00:49:09,536
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a groupie that respects boundaries.

779
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:09,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

780
00:49:10,236 --> 00:49:10,676
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fair.

781
00:49:11,236 --> 00:49:12,077
[SPEAKER_14]: I prefer fanboys.

782
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:12,797
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

783
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what kind of games have you been playing this week, Dark Tetsuya?

784
00:49:16,438 --> 00:49:19,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Just stuff on the league.

785
00:49:19,098 --> 00:49:22,259
[SPEAKER_09]: There must have been something that compelled you to pick up the phone and call in.

786
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there a story tonight that particularly touched a nerve with you?

787
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:28,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the AOU stuff.

788
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:32,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, the arcade stuff we talked about in Part 8, like the Silent Hill game and DDR Supernova.

789
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,780
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think of all that?

790
00:49:35,161 --> 00:49:36,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it sounds pretty cool.

791
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:37,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm stoked about Supernova 2.

792
00:49:39,882 --> 00:49:45,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, did you think Supernova was a real, like, did it kind of rescue the DDR series?

793
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:47,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

794
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:48,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

795
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:51,526
[SPEAKER_09]: What features would you like to see new in Supernova 2?

796
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:54,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just new songs, or what would you like to see Konami do with Supernova 2?

797
00:49:56,636 --> 00:50:00,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, except in the new song, they should probably put in the link mode.

798
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:02,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, link mode.

799
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, so like you can use your memory card from the home version on the arcade.

800
00:50:07,142 --> 00:50:07,742
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good idea.

801
00:50:08,122 --> 00:50:08,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it'll happen.

802
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:11,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you like to track your data?

803
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:12,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

804
00:50:14,426 --> 00:50:20,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, who changed his name to ActdeftMarissaFan in chat, says remember to put in link mode.

805
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:20,829
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

806
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:21,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

807
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dr. Tsuyo?

808
00:50:25,925 --> 00:50:27,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I just thought that Silent Hill game was cool.

809
00:50:28,327 --> 00:50:29,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it does.

810
00:50:29,368 --> 00:50:33,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think Silent Hill's going to work as a first-person shooter?

811
00:50:34,393 --> 00:50:34,893
[SPEAKER_11]: It might.

812
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:37,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we'll see when we play the game, huh?

813
00:50:38,396 --> 00:50:38,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

814
00:50:38,796 --> 00:50:40,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think the graphics look okay?

815
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:46,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, DarkSakura was kind of knocking the graphics earlier, saying that PlayStation 2 had better graphics.

816
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:46,503
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

817
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:47,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

818
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:50,286
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, they look pretty good.

819
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:51,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of atmospheric.

820
00:50:52,608 --> 00:50:54,750
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

821
00:51:22,248 --> 00:51:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Silent Hill's going to suck as a first-person shooter.

822
00:51:26,732 --> 00:51:28,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you think it's going to suck as a first-person shooter?

823
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:30,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

824
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:35,199
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not going to be atmospheric enough, I don't think.

825
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:40,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think it's going to fall into the same pattern that the Resident Evil Gun Survivor games did?

826
00:51:41,384 --> 00:51:42,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, definitely.

827
00:51:42,645 --> 00:51:44,887
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I actually liked the second one.

828
00:51:44,947 --> 00:51:50,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to play the Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, and I thought it was pretty cool, but...

829
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,862
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really trying to reserve my judgment for actually playing it.

830
00:51:55,942 --> 00:51:56,923
[SPEAKER_14]: I just love Silent Hill.

831
00:51:59,465 --> 00:52:03,909
[SPEAKER_05]: But nah, I like the atmosphere and the whole ambience about it.

832
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:05,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it'll work.

833
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:06,891
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think would make it cool?

834
00:52:10,414 --> 00:52:11,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Apart from Pyramid Heads.

835
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,037
[SPEAKER_14]: But it has nurses!

836
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:17,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

837
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not a really big fan of first person shooters, I guess.

838
00:52:21,954 --> 00:52:26,537
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you were going to design a Silent Hill arcade game, how would you make it?

839
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:31,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably wouldn't make one, to be honest.

840
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:33,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

841
00:52:34,382 --> 00:52:41,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, I think you have a fan here in studio who wanted to say hello to you, Sesha, since you called in.

842
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:42,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead and say hello.

843
00:52:43,148 --> 00:52:44,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, hot, sexy British guy.

844
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,731
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Rice Princess, by the way.

845
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:49,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rice Princess.

846
00:52:49,352 --> 00:52:49,933
[SPEAKER_14]: How's it going?

847
00:52:49,953 --> 00:52:50,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

848
00:52:52,312 --> 00:52:53,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really tired, actually.

849
00:52:53,373 --> 00:52:54,134
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 5 a.m.

850
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:55,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God.

851
00:52:55,595 --> 00:52:58,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Aw, and he stayed up to listen to us.

852
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:01,241
[SPEAKER_09]: No, to listen to us, right?

853
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Princess, not you.

854
00:53:02,202 --> 00:53:03,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm going to go and cry in a corner.

855
00:53:04,003 --> 00:53:04,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Not true.

856
00:53:04,203 --> 00:53:05,645
[SPEAKER_14]: He did ask about her.

857
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:08,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Aw, that's so sweet.

858
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:09,128
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's all sexy.

859
00:53:09,148 --> 00:53:10,930
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys should add each other on MySpace or something.

860
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God, we totally should.

861
00:53:13,172 --> 00:53:14,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you use MySpace, Sesha?

862
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do.

863
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:21,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, type it to Sky in the chat room.

864
00:53:21,505 --> 00:53:23,406
[SPEAKER_14]: He's on my friends list.

865
00:53:23,486 --> 00:53:23,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, is he?

866
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:24,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

867
00:53:25,808 --> 00:53:26,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, now.

868
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:27,630
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

869
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:28,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.

870
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,833
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have a girlfriend that's going to get pissed if you're talking to Rice Princess online, are you?

871
00:53:32,634 --> 00:53:32,874
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

872
00:53:33,074 --> 00:53:33,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

873
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:34,015
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

874
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:34,395
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

875
00:53:34,615 --> 00:53:34,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.

876
00:53:35,236 --> 00:53:35,536
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

877
00:53:35,996 --> 00:53:40,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Because she loves Silent Hill and could talk all about the first person games with you, I guess.

878
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:40,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

879
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

880
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:42,141
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

881
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:43,082
[SPEAKER_05]: She might convince me.

882
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hey.

883
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:47,669
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I've got a bet going now.

884
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:49,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Why, what's that?

885
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:52,332
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet Irene can convince.

886
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:54,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, man.

887
00:53:55,413 --> 00:53:55,794
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give you $50.

888
00:53:56,194 --> 00:53:56,914
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

889
00:53:57,214 --> 00:53:59,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is like next to nothing in pounds, right?

890
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:01,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's totally nothing at all.

891
00:54:02,421 --> 00:54:02,822
[SPEAKER_14]: See you guys.

892
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:03,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye, sexy British guy.

893
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:22,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever even seen a picture?

894
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:23,082
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't care.

895
00:54:23,123 --> 00:54:24,303
[SPEAKER_14]: He sounds hot.

896
00:54:24,383 --> 00:54:26,425
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very not superficial of you.

897
00:54:26,485 --> 00:54:27,205
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very nice.

898
00:54:27,406 --> 00:54:28,206
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

899
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:30,528
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he sounds really hot, dude.

900
00:54:30,648 --> 00:54:31,448
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw his picture.

901
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:31,989
[SPEAKER_14]: He's cute.

902
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:33,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Note to all guys.

903
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he's cute.

904
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:35,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Get fake British accents.

905
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:36,252
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll work.

906
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:46,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, next week on Orange Sounds Radio, we're going to be talking about... Instant softie there.

907
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:46,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

908
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:47,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

909
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:50,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what I'm doing wrong?

910
00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:51,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that why I can't get laid?

911
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that why I haven't had a date in so long?

912
00:54:58,002 --> 00:54:59,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's go to another call, shall we?

913
00:54:59,603 --> 00:55:02,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, you're on Tea with Orange Lounge Radio.

914
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:02,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

915
00:55:10,836 --> 00:55:12,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, that voice turned me on.

916
00:55:12,297 --> 00:55:14,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, DMN!

917
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you.

918
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, DMN.

919
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now!

920
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, everybody.

921
00:55:22,721 --> 00:55:22,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi!

922
00:55:23,381 --> 00:55:26,403
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to come to my birthday party, you bastard.

923
00:55:27,443 --> 00:55:28,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try.

924
00:55:28,623 --> 00:55:28,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

925
00:55:31,004 --> 00:55:33,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Something about Crackdown I actually wanted to talk about.

926
00:55:33,766 --> 00:55:35,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what's that?

927
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:39,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if any of you guys heard, but a Halo 3 demo came with Crackdown.

928
00:55:40,396 --> 00:55:41,977
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, careful.

929
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:43,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't call it a demo.

930
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:44,359
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a beta.

931
00:55:44,499 --> 00:55:47,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill Gates will personally come sodomize you if you call it a demo.

932
00:55:47,822 --> 00:55:48,963
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't come with a demo.

933
00:55:49,103 --> 00:55:50,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be available for download later.

934
00:55:51,885 --> 00:56:03,694
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing I don't get is that rabid Halo fanboys who wank off to Master Chief are basically saying, Oh my God, I have to pay $60 to play the beta.

935
00:56:03,954 --> 00:56:04,675
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beta.

936
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:04,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

937
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:15,914
[SPEAKER_01]: No you don't, you could have done all those other things like register and be drawn randomly or play Halo 2 for some amount of time and be the first 13,333 people.

938
00:56:16,154 --> 00:56:19,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you could unbunch your wedgie and just wait for the real game to come out.

939
00:56:20,523 --> 00:56:21,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I'm saying.

940
00:56:21,704 --> 00:56:22,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a beta test.

941
00:56:23,345 --> 00:56:27,589
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the first console games I've ever known of that's having a public beta test.

942
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:29,831
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like I was saying earlier in the show.

943
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:38,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though 11 billion people are in the Halo 3 beta, and I'm very sorry to Mike W. who was complaining earlier about being a Halo fan and being the only person not in the beta.

944
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:40,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not in the beta either, but I don't care.

945
00:56:41,601 --> 00:56:45,264
[SPEAKER_09]: For some reason, people want to be in this beta because it makes their internet penis bigger.

946
00:56:45,304 --> 00:56:47,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's like, I was in the Halo 3 beta.

947
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you and half the internet.

948
00:56:51,729 --> 00:56:52,809
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty ridiculous.

949
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:56,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, DMN?

950
00:56:57,653 --> 00:57:00,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, STFU, we're looking for a guest.

951
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:02,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody who's listening live would like to be a guest.

952
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:05,858
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taping Tuesday night, so shoot me an eye.

953
00:57:05,878 --> 00:57:07,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you have Rice Princess as a guest?

954
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:08,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, DarkSakura.

955
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to, but I'm actually, and I was going to say something about that.

956
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:13,623
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot that my class that I thought was Friday is actually on Tuesday.

957
00:57:14,363 --> 00:57:15,804
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually taking chakra mapping.

958
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:17,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Metaphysical shit.

959
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:19,247
[SPEAKER_14]: At my massage therapy school.

960
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:19,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

961
00:57:20,972 --> 00:57:22,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want me to manipulate your energy, DMN?

962
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:25,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any energy today.

963
00:57:25,954 --> 00:57:26,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I ran out of it.

964
00:57:27,254 --> 00:57:28,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you have Marissa on?

965
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:35,657
[SPEAKER_09]: She's welcome to come on if she wants.

966
00:57:35,877 --> 00:57:36,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Whee!

967
00:57:36,977 --> 00:57:44,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I say you get a bunch of girls on your show this week and see how you like it when you have more girls than guys on the show.

968
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I see what you did there.

969
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,101
[SPEAKER_09]: You kind of put your own show name in there.

970
00:57:50,703 --> 00:57:50,983
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

971
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:54,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Tune in to SCFU on Thursday nights right here on Orange Laundry.

972
00:57:54,626 --> 00:57:55,267
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 7 o'clock Pacific.

973
00:57:55,307 --> 00:57:56,068
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good time.

974
00:57:57,569 --> 00:57:57,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually.

975
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, DMN.

976
00:57:59,550 --> 00:57:59,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

977
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:00,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

978
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:01,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

979
00:58:01,372 --> 00:58:02,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, do we have a picture?

980
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:03,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, is this a picture?

981
00:58:04,154 --> 00:58:04,394
Yeah.

982
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:04,875
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

983
00:58:04,895 --> 00:58:05,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see the British guy.

984
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:06,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

985
00:58:06,076 --> 00:58:06,736
[SPEAKER_09]: We all want to see.

986
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Rice Princess ran over.

987
00:58:07,797 --> 00:58:08,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

988
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:08,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

989
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:10,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

990
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,140
[SPEAKER_14]: British guy's hot.

991
00:58:11,941 --> 00:58:12,901
[SPEAKER_09]: He's kind of young.

992
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:15,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but he's still hot.

993
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:16,905
[SPEAKER_14]: British guy is hot.

994
00:58:18,117 --> 00:58:19,417
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to scare the poor guy off.

995
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:20,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, you're a pimp, man.

996
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:20,998
[SPEAKER_09]: He's never going to come to chat again.

997
00:58:21,018 --> 00:58:22,058
[SPEAKER_09]: He's never going to come to chat again.

998
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:23,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at his other pictures real quick.

999
00:58:23,658 --> 00:58:24,099
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1000
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:26,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Even Shane, like, randomly appeared out of nowhere.

1001
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard something about a British guy.

1002
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, he's got... Okay, that's awesome.

1003
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,901
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got very nice eyes.

1004
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:33,601
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1005
00:58:33,661 --> 00:58:35,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, can we go to another call?

1006
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:36,442
[SPEAKER_09]: May we please go to another call?

1007
00:58:36,522 --> 00:58:37,642
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to another call.

1008
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:39,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Watch Radio.

1009
00:58:39,503 --> 00:58:39,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1010
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:42,823
[SPEAKER_09]: No, my last name.

1011
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Rana.

1012
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:46,363
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Ranma.

1013
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:47,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this Ranma?

1014
00:58:49,725 --> 00:58:50,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Who is it?

1015
00:58:50,806 --> 00:58:52,647
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Extover calling.

1016
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:54,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up, Extover!

1017
00:58:54,028 --> 00:58:55,529
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Extover calling from the living room.

1018
00:58:56,709 --> 00:58:58,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so not Ranma.

1019
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,231
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny.

1020
00:59:00,852 --> 00:59:02,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I sound black?

1021
00:59:02,533 --> 00:59:05,034
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm totally white.

1022
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:13,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the few times that I've been on this show and Ranma has called in, he's like scratchy like he's calling from his cell phone because his what's it called?

1023
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:14,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Get off the fucking phone!

1024
00:59:16,347 --> 00:59:18,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that makes sense.

1025
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, bye!

1026
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:20,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucker.

1027
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,750
[SPEAKER_12]: No cookie!

1028
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:28,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate this show.

1029
00:59:28,873 --> 00:59:33,795
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, by the way, Marissa, Actdeft is now ActdeftMarissaFan.

1030
00:59:33,895 --> 00:59:34,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

1031
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:36,096
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta go, we gotta go to another call.

1032
00:59:36,116 --> 00:59:36,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Taunch Radio.

1033
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:37,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1034
00:59:39,918 --> 00:59:40,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Static.

1035
00:59:41,618 --> 00:59:41,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

1036
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:42,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear us?

1037
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:52,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, unfortunately that caller did not go through, and it was a new caller, and I feel bad that I had to hang up, but... No, you don't.

1038
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:58,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, I just, you know, I appreciate new people taking the effort to call in, but unfortunately we couldn't hear you.

1039
00:59:58,659 --> 00:59:59,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe there was lag or something.

1040
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:00,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft says, heart, Marissa.

1041
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:02,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Heart, you too.

1042
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:05,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's also a PSA for any new caller from the show.

1043
01:00:05,864 --> 01:00:08,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, and that's why I felt bad, because I wanted to hear from Uni.

1044
01:00:09,006 --> 01:00:09,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Use the power of evil.

1045
01:00:10,227 --> 01:00:11,147
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's all right.

1046
01:00:12,448 --> 01:00:13,669
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to another call in the meantime.

1047
01:00:14,332 --> 01:00:15,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

1048
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:15,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1049
01:00:16,773 --> 01:00:19,915
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a long-time listener, Dark Knight, rising from the dead.

1050
01:00:20,395 --> 01:00:21,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Dark Knight.

1051
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:22,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, it's DK.

1052
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:24,137
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long time since we heard from you, buddy.

1053
01:00:24,157 --> 01:00:24,737
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

1054
01:00:25,737 --> 01:00:26,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing much.

1055
01:00:26,738 --> 01:00:30,159
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I might give... Ooh, hold on.

1056
01:00:30,179 --> 01:00:30,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1057
01:00:30,439 --> 01:00:31,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Feedback's horrible, isn't it?

1058
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,281
[SPEAKER_14]: He's my southern buddy.

1059
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:36,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm good.

1060
01:00:36,882 --> 01:00:40,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just want to give a little mini-review on Diddy Kong.

1061
01:00:40,564 --> 01:00:42,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw it in the chat room earlier about it.

1062
01:00:42,782 --> 01:00:43,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Please do.

1063
01:00:43,302 --> 01:00:44,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played this game yet.

1064
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious if I should pick it up.

1065
01:00:46,764 --> 01:00:51,246
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay, but like they said, it's more like a rehash of the N64 version.

1066
01:00:52,866 --> 01:00:53,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1067
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:56,068
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed like a rehash of the N64 version.

1068
01:00:56,308 --> 01:01:01,150
[SPEAKER_10]: The only difference is that some of the minigames will incorporate the use of the stylus.

1069
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:08,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it sort of like how Mario on the DS, the launch title, was just kind of Mario 64 with some extra frills?

1070
01:01:10,828 --> 01:01:11,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1071
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:15,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, it was more of a rehash, if anything else.

1072
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:20,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Like when you're doing your turbo boost, you know how on the N64 one you usually hit the buttons?

1073
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:25,713
[SPEAKER_10]: To do the turbo boost on this one, you actually got to use the stylus to boost your level up to do the boost.

1074
01:01:27,553 --> 01:01:29,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, would you recommend the game to others?

1075
01:01:30,734 --> 01:01:31,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no.

1076
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,315
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

1077
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:34,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yes, no?

1078
01:01:34,615 --> 01:01:35,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know?

1079
01:01:36,216 --> 01:01:37,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know.

1080
01:01:37,596 --> 01:01:37,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

1081
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:49,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes to some diehard fans, but if you've never played Diddy Kong before or something like that, you might want to pass.

1082
01:01:49,955 --> 01:01:54,717
[SPEAKER_09]: So people that are expecting to play Mario Kart DS Part 2, they're going to be disappointed, you think?

1083
01:01:55,397 --> 01:01:57,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Just about, if anything else.

1084
01:01:58,498 --> 01:02:00,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, so noted.

1085
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:02,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to comment on on tonight's show?

1086
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:06,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, it's been a long time calling the show.

1087
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss talking to y'all guys at times.

1088
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:11,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we miss having you call in, so feel free to call us anytime.

1089
01:02:11,843 --> 01:02:12,543
[SPEAKER_09]: You know where to find us.

1090
01:02:13,524 --> 01:02:21,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, usually, though, I'm calling on Travis' show, and he can tell you that I have been a good appearance on that show lately.

1091
01:02:22,128 --> 01:02:27,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Travis has a great show, and all the callers just enhance to that show, no matter how good or bad they are.

1092
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:28,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a good time.

1093
01:02:28,723 --> 01:02:32,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially since he has a NASCAR partner, so yeah.

1094
01:02:32,246 --> 01:02:33,928
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Saturday nights on Orange Launch Radio, by the way.

1095
01:02:33,968 --> 01:02:34,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Check it out.

1096
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:34,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Travis Donovan.

1097
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,551
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Dark Knight, have a good one, and thanks so much for your call.

1098
01:02:38,092 --> 01:02:38,452
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.

1099
01:02:38,472 --> 01:02:38,932
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a good night.

1100
01:02:39,012 --> 01:02:39,373
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

1101
01:02:39,913 --> 01:02:40,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Later, guys.

1102
01:02:40,414 --> 01:02:40,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

1103
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:41,274
Bye.

1104
01:02:41,855 --> 01:02:42,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1105
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:42,696
Bye.

1106
01:02:43,036 --> 01:02:44,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I like hearing from Dark Knight.

1107
01:02:45,418 --> 01:02:46,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I like hearing from all our callers.

1108
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:52,807
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're wondering and you're sitting at home and asking yourself, why do the same people call in every week?

1109
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:53,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they can.

1110
01:02:54,128 --> 01:02:55,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio is an open forum.

1111
01:02:56,009 --> 01:03:01,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you are sick and tired of hearing the same people every week on this show, as awesome as they are, you need to start calling in too.

1112
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:05,234
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can do that by listening to us Sunday nights live at 6 o'clock Pacific time.

1113
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:08,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can leave us a voicemail at any time during the week.

1114
01:03:08,116 --> 01:03:10,517
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't had a lot of them lately, so we haven't had anything to play.

1115
01:03:10,838 --> 01:03:14,440
[SPEAKER_09]: But 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number if you ever want to leave a voicemail.

1116
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1117
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:16,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1118
01:03:18,482 --> 01:03:21,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey there, this is Let's Have Tea.

1119
01:03:21,285 --> 01:03:22,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, what's up, G?

1120
01:03:22,326 --> 01:03:22,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that it?

1121
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:24,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have tea.

1122
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:26,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let's have tea.

1123
01:03:26,229 --> 01:03:27,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought he said, what's up, G?

1124
01:03:28,811 --> 01:03:29,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Word, yo!

1125
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:31,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I fuck up that name?

1126
01:03:31,694 --> 01:03:32,114
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

1127
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually had a little tea earlier.

1128
01:03:34,637 --> 01:03:36,098
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, Let's Have Tea?

1129
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually wondering what your thoughts was on the XNA thing.

1130
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:48,761
[SPEAKER_09]: On XNA, the amateur development studio for Xbox.

1131
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:50,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody have a thought on this?

1132
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I talk too much on the show, so I'm deferring.

1133
01:03:52,602 --> 01:03:55,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a thought that I really haven't cared too much about it.

1134
01:03:56,603 --> 01:03:58,344
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're not really into the programming stuff.

1135
01:03:58,364 --> 01:03:59,444
[SPEAKER_09]: You just want to play the game, right?

1136
01:03:59,884 --> 01:04:00,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no.

1137
01:04:00,344 --> 01:04:02,065
[SPEAKER_14]: I like seeing the behind-the-scenes stuff.

1138
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:05,726
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just I'm like... I guess maybe I'm too saturated right now.

1139
01:04:06,566 --> 01:04:09,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and maybe it's like for you... I go looking for behind-the-scenes stuff all the time.

1140
01:04:09,707 --> 01:04:11,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got done watching behind-the-scenes of Silent Hill 3.

1141
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:13,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I would love to see...

1142
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:16,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know a lick about video game programming.

1143
01:04:16,677 --> 01:04:17,477
[SPEAKER_09]: XNA does nothing for me.

1144
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:50,567
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm excited at the prospect of, you know, it's going to make original games because there's going to be independent developers, you know, one-man, two-man, three-man teams out there making their own games.

1145
01:04:50,848 --> 01:04:54,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to see some of those on, you know, Xbox Live and see what original content's out there.

1146
01:04:57,614 --> 01:05:02,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look at some of the games that have been developed for the web that are starting to get big now.

1147
01:05:02,118 --> 01:05:05,081
[SPEAKER_09]: You have Flow, Line Rider, you know, those types of things.

1148
01:05:05,141 --> 01:05:06,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I think XNA could produce more stuff like that.

1149
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, definitely.

1150
01:05:10,602 --> 01:05:11,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on a few teams for 3D modeling and such.

1151
01:05:11,683 --> 01:05:12,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me?

1152
01:05:12,143 --> 01:05:15,487
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3D modeling is hard stuff, so.

1153
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:41,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're having a little bit of lag and that happens because our internet's getting hammered here.

1154
01:05:41,945 --> 01:05:46,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'll ask you one last question and hopefully you can make this out.

1155
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:49,810
[SPEAKER_09]: What would be your response to this question?

1156
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:53,472
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you hope XNA can accomplish in the next six months, a year?

1157
01:05:55,753 --> 01:06:00,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really looking forward to seeing more original content.

1158
01:06:01,363 --> 01:06:08,004
[SPEAKER_03]: because most game developers now are too afraid of making something new rather than just continuing with sequels and such.

1159
01:06:08,884 --> 01:06:17,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So XNA will be able to have independent developers and small online teams be able to make something new and original.

1160
01:06:20,506 --> 01:06:20,826
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1161
01:06:20,886 --> 01:06:21,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good luck.

1162
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,507
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like you're doing some of that XNA stuff yourself.

1163
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:28,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So good luck to the things that you're modeling and all that.

1164
01:06:28,168 --> 01:06:30,568
[SPEAKER_09]: And let us know if you work on any games that show up

1165
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:43,016
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a good idea, actually, because it seems like, to be vulgar, as I usually am, that games are just turning into long series of porns with the same name.

1166
01:06:43,796 --> 01:06:46,237
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Depressed Men 10.

1167
01:06:47,177 --> 01:06:55,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Some original games would be nice, and again, I'm not well-versed in the PSP at all, but I actually gave it to my ex-boyfriend, being very stupid and very broken.

1168
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:59,420
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot to get him a game as well, but he didn't care because he was excited about everything that was homebrew.

1169
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:00,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say...

1170
01:07:01,502 --> 01:07:06,065
[SPEAKER_09]: That is some amazing insight from a casual gamer that games are starting to sound like porn titles.

1171
01:07:06,705 --> 01:07:10,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you're kind of right, and I've never thought about it that way before, but it's kind of true.

1172
01:07:10,788 --> 01:07:11,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Cooking Mama.

1173
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:16,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's poke Mama's steak.

1174
01:07:16,891 --> 01:07:18,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Mama likes hot, press that steak.

1175
01:07:18,912 --> 01:07:19,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have tea.

1176
01:07:21,174 --> 01:07:22,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for the call, okay, buddy?

1177
01:07:22,755 --> 01:07:24,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

1178
01:07:24,295 --> 01:07:24,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one.

1179
01:07:26,721 --> 01:07:27,602
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, G?

1180
01:07:27,642 --> 01:07:28,242
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, G?

1181
01:07:28,342 --> 01:07:28,702
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, G?

1182
01:07:28,722 --> 01:07:28,963
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, G?

1183
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it once.

1184
01:07:59,483 --> 01:08:01,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Lesbians love sheep.

1185
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:07,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what that means, but I don't even want to know.

1186
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I like my plushie from Harvest Moon.

1187
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:10,252
[SPEAKER_09]: But you don't really play the games?

1188
01:08:10,332 --> 01:08:11,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

1189
01:08:11,032 --> 01:08:14,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to just watch people play it, and I thought it was amusing.

1190
01:08:14,295 --> 01:08:14,856
[SPEAKER_09]: You got one.

1191
01:08:14,896 --> 01:08:15,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you a Harvest Moon player?

1192
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:17,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I am.

1193
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:25,184
[SPEAKER_14]: My sister and mom got me Harvest Moon More Friends of Mineral Town for Christmas.

1194
01:08:26,922 --> 01:08:32,287
[SPEAKER_14]: And, seriously, that game is like crack.

1195
01:08:32,468 --> 01:08:39,174
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, my sister and I would play it just, you know, to like say, who's going to marry who or something.

1196
01:08:39,194 --> 01:08:42,417
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really stupid.

1197
01:08:42,897 --> 01:08:47,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, try to sell me on this game for a minute, because I'm not a huge Harvest Moon person.

1198
01:08:47,742 --> 01:08:49,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should I play Harvest Moon?

1199
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:51,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you start out...

1200
01:08:51,903 --> 01:08:57,746
[SPEAKER_14]: You're trying to save... Well, the first one I played, you are trying to save this town called Mineral Town.

1201
01:08:58,627 --> 01:09:09,373
[SPEAKER_14]: And basically, if you take three years to sell as many crops as you can, bring as much reputation to the town, which is Mineral Town... Wait, I've got to play this game for three years?

1202
01:09:10,253 --> 01:09:13,335
[SPEAKER_14]: No, the days last a few hours, right?

1203
01:09:13,675 --> 01:09:18,218
[SPEAKER_14]: The days last for about ten minutes, to be totally honest.

1204
01:09:19,939 --> 01:09:20,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And...

1205
01:09:21,414 --> 01:09:30,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's kind of like that with the more friends of Miller Town, which you're basically playing as a female instead of a male.

1206
01:09:31,237 --> 01:09:35,158
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can actually marry somebody on that game.

1207
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:42,140
[SPEAKER_14]: You can actually marry men when you're on the woman's version, and you can marry a woman on the men's version.

1208
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Lame.

1209
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:45,121
[SPEAKER_09]: No gay marriage.

1210
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:45,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you partner?

1211
01:09:46,322 --> 01:09:47,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you get a civil union?

1212
01:09:48,337 --> 01:09:49,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, no, I'm sorry.

1213
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:50,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I played The Sims.

1214
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:51,940
[SPEAKER_09]: We're used to it.

1215
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:52,761
[SPEAKER_09]: We're used to it.

1216
01:09:53,282 --> 01:09:59,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, one more question for you, even though you're the one that called us.

1217
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:01,549
[SPEAKER_09]: What makes this game different from, like, Animal Crossing?

1218
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:04,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you...

1219
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:09,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe the wrong person.

1220
01:10:09,259 --> 01:10:18,647
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to go take the pink dresser from cat person's house to the dog person and then take a letter to the owl person.

1221
01:10:18,968 --> 01:10:20,789
[SPEAKER_14]: You just grow shit and sell it.

1222
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:22,491
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you feed your dog.

1223
01:10:22,571 --> 01:10:26,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember getting the sheep in Harvest Moon to say, you cunt.

1224
01:10:29,417 --> 01:10:29,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I right?

1225
01:10:31,118 --> 01:10:31,959
[SPEAKER_14]: That's totally true.

1226
01:10:33,388 --> 01:10:35,691
[SPEAKER_14]: But you do have to comb your horse.

1227
01:10:36,452 --> 01:10:37,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you do.

1228
01:10:37,753 --> 01:10:39,595
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to comb it all the time.

1229
01:10:39,895 --> 01:10:41,838
[SPEAKER_14]: And kick your cow.

1230
01:10:42,258 --> 01:10:43,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you get to tip the cows, though?

1231
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:44,561
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can't.

1232
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:45,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you can.

1233
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:46,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you tip your cows?

1234
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:47,564
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1235
01:10:47,584 --> 01:10:49,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they give you that option.

1236
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:51,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Uni, I know your name is really simple, but I love it.

1237
01:10:52,871 --> 01:10:56,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw a thing with a unicorn today and I geeked out because of my girl.

1238
01:10:57,534 --> 01:11:00,837
[SPEAKER_09]: If I remember right, isn't it based off of Yuna from Final Fantasy X?

1239
01:11:01,217 --> 01:11:01,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-huh, yes.

1240
01:11:02,478 --> 01:11:06,201
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my DDR nickname back when I was playing in Rhode Island.

1241
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,723
[SPEAKER_14]: At least your teacher didn't name you.

1242
01:11:09,024 --> 01:11:13,027
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of girls that are into games seem to really enjoy Yuni.

1243
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, not Yuni.

1244
01:11:14,408 --> 01:11:15,849
[SPEAKER_09]: If they like Yuni, they sure do.

1245
01:11:16,129 --> 01:11:17,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Yuna from Final Fantasy X.

1246
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,262
[SPEAKER_09]: She's like a role model for girls or something.

1247
01:11:21,382 --> 01:11:23,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually a lot like her in real life.

1248
01:11:23,504 --> 01:11:24,325
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean she's normal?

1249
01:11:24,505 --> 01:11:25,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

1250
01:11:25,266 --> 01:11:25,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird, huh?

1251
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:27,008
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1252
01:11:28,089 --> 01:11:30,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that there's anything wrong with the big boobies.

1253
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:32,353
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing wrong with the big boobies at all.

1254
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:34,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1255
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:37,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, I should let you guys go.

1256
01:11:37,097 --> 01:11:37,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks.

1257
01:11:37,858 --> 01:11:38,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the advice.

1258
01:11:39,019 --> 01:11:39,900
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you, Uni.

1259
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,101
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, Uni.

1260
01:11:41,121 --> 01:11:41,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the call.

1261
01:11:41,822 --> 01:11:42,442
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate it.

1262
01:11:43,443 --> 01:11:43,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1263
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:44,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1264
01:11:44,781 --> 01:11:45,141
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1265
01:11:45,462 --> 01:11:46,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so pathetic.

1266
01:11:46,242 --> 01:11:49,144
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll probably do, like, one more call here on the show.

1267
01:11:49,224 --> 01:11:59,092
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can always call us on the old-fashioned Skype line or whatever you want to do.

1268
01:11:59,132 --> 01:11:59,953
[SPEAKER_02]: What was Yuna from?

1269
01:12:00,513 --> 01:12:02,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy X. I've not played that game.

1270
01:12:02,474 --> 01:12:02,895
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.

1271
01:12:02,955 --> 01:12:03,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good game.

1272
01:12:03,655 --> 01:12:05,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I haven't been able to pick it up, so that's why.

1273
01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:07,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a unicorn today.

1274
01:12:07,038 --> 01:12:08,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, unicorns, and I saw her name.

1275
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:09,600
[SPEAKER_02]: A unicorn?

1276
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,761
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so fucking pathetic.

1277
01:12:11,802 --> 01:12:12,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, you're interesting.

1278
01:12:13,102 --> 01:12:13,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

1279
01:12:14,366 --> 01:12:14,786
[SPEAKER_09]: But I love you.

1280
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's do at least one more call here.

1281
01:12:17,147 --> 01:12:18,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

1282
01:12:18,107 --> 01:12:18,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1283
01:12:19,787 --> 01:12:20,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Raven's Dolphin.

1284
01:12:20,907 --> 01:12:21,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Raven's Dolphin.

1285
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:22,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Raven's Dolphin.

1286
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:23,348
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1287
01:12:25,028 --> 01:12:27,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the saddest attorney in the world.

1288
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:28,929
[SPEAKER_13]: I object to that.

1289
01:12:29,409 --> 01:12:29,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Objection.

1290
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:31,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Overruled, motherfucker!

1291
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,050
[SPEAKER_13]: I am a legal secretary.

1292
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you.

1293
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:38,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, what is legally on your mind, dude?

1294
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:43,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, legally, I did get my hands on Phoenix Wright's Justice for All.

1295
01:12:43,712 --> 01:12:44,152
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you think?

1296
01:12:45,723 --> 01:12:46,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

1297
01:12:46,504 --> 01:12:53,648
[SPEAKER_04]: It is kind of like an attenuation of the game, but hey, it's Phoenix Wright, and you all should pick it up.

1298
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:54,148
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1299
01:12:54,448 --> 01:12:57,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me what I'm in for if I've never played Phoenix Wright before.

1300
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:00,412
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I expect from Phoenix Wright, either the first or second one?

1301
01:13:02,013 --> 01:13:11,219
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, this one, you know, Phoenix Wright's a text game, so you have to click a lot and read a lot, and you have to find clues and contradictions in the game.

1302
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:12,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't find things...

1303
01:13:13,581 --> 01:13:15,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Things get a little hairy, you know.

1304
01:13:15,122 --> 01:13:20,165
[SPEAKER_04]: If you mess up and show Judge the wrong kind of evidence, he will go, uh-uh, not true.

1305
01:13:20,425 --> 01:13:21,526
[SPEAKER_04]: And he will go, bang.

1306
01:13:21,546 --> 01:13:22,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll look stupid.

1307
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:27,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the story is so insane and it's like Law and Order.

1308
01:13:27,129 --> 01:13:29,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever played something like this before?

1309
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:44,458
[SPEAKER_04]: The story's so driven.

1310
01:13:44,618 --> 01:13:46,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very story-driven game.

1311
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:49,420
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to see how the story's progressing.

1312
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Edgeworth trial, I'm not going to give away anything.

1313
01:13:52,781 --> 01:13:55,162
[SPEAKER_04]: All I'm saying is, holy shit, holy shit.

1314
01:13:56,063 --> 01:13:58,524
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's got a good story, like Law & Order, like an episode of Law & Order.

1315
01:13:58,704 --> 01:13:59,624
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the girl with the whip?

1316
01:13:59,764 --> 01:14:00,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1317
01:14:00,985 --> 01:14:01,825
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the girl with the whip?

1318
01:14:01,885 --> 01:14:04,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

1319
01:14:04,226 --> 01:14:05,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't she make you miss things?

1320
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:08,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that girl.

1321
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:11,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw art stuff of her, and she was fucking hot.

1322
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:12,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that on, like, DeviantArt?

1323
01:14:12,938 --> 01:14:13,359
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1324
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:13,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1325
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:16,980
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you do not go there for concept art.

1326
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:20,561
[SPEAKER_02]: You go there for porn, Rob.

1327
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:22,741
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the difference between a lawyer and a catfish?

1328
01:14:23,061 --> 01:14:23,281
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1329
01:14:23,601 --> 01:14:26,142
[SPEAKER_13]: One's a scum-sucking bottom feeder, and the other's a fish.

1330
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:28,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice, very nice.

1331
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:30,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Raven's dog.

1332
01:14:31,264 --> 01:14:31,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Raven's dog.

1333
01:14:31,624 --> 01:14:32,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what else?

1334
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:41,970
[SPEAKER_09]: How did you fail?

1335
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:42,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard this.

1336
01:14:42,951 --> 01:14:48,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I love all games, but they almost produce too much show that I can't stay on top of it a lot.

1337
01:14:49,316 --> 01:14:51,778
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to kind of tell me, what were they saying?

1338
01:14:51,798 --> 01:14:52,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick.

1339
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it was 360 fun because

1340
01:15:01,755 --> 01:15:03,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a bunch of hardcore gamers in there.

1341
01:15:03,596 --> 01:15:14,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, well, I love everyone, but then, you know, if you put a bunch of hardcore gamers, they're going to pick the 360 because it's the best, and that's all I have to say.

1342
01:15:15,124 --> 01:15:23,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And they ask me that, why does the graphics suck, and I go, they don't suck, it's because it's based off of GameCube architecture.

1343
01:15:23,709 --> 01:15:30,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I defend it and say, the GameCube architecture is actually pretty strong, just look at Resident Evil 4.

1344
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:33,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it's, you know, it's not like the graphics are bad.

1345
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,822
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's gameplay versus graphics.

1346
01:15:37,562 --> 01:15:39,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not to say that the Xbox has crappy gameplay.

1347
01:15:40,384 --> 01:15:42,606
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that the Wii does something a little different.

1348
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:43,206
[SPEAKER_09]: They're different.

1349
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:45,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, it's so hard to compare the two.

1350
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:46,909
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I don't know.

1351
01:15:47,049 --> 01:15:47,629
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just my thought.

1352
01:15:47,649 --> 01:15:48,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I love them both.

1353
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:49,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm totally a Wii 60 person.

1354
01:15:49,851 --> 01:15:50,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally am.

1355
01:15:50,891 --> 01:15:51,212
[SPEAKER_09]: That's me.

1356
01:15:51,812 --> 01:15:53,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not, I'm not sold on Sony.

1357
01:15:53,513 --> 01:15:54,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sold on Sony yet.

1358
01:15:56,395 --> 01:15:57,796
[SPEAKER_09]: At least this generation.

1359
01:15:58,657 --> 01:16:00,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Last generation, I was totally an S2 fanboy.

1360
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:05,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's it.

1361
01:16:05,221 --> 01:16:05,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we better go.

1362
01:16:06,302 --> 01:16:07,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, Ravenstolphin, though.

1363
01:16:07,523 --> 01:16:09,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a nice one, and we appreciate you calling.

1364
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:10,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you too.

1365
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:10,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1366
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:10,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

1367
01:16:12,487 --> 01:16:15,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know a lot of people have been trying to get through tonight, and I apologize.

1368
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:18,573
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to take everyone's calls.

1369
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:22,356
[SPEAKER_09]: We've run a little long in both segments, if you can't tell, so we've got to wrap it up.

1370
01:16:23,057 --> 01:16:24,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Any last-minute stories here in studio?

1371
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, actually.

1372
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:27,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what's up?

1373
01:16:28,832 --> 01:16:36,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Just for anyone who is a fan of Darwinia, Uplink, or Defcon, Introversion is actually stating that they're planning on putting out console games.

1374
01:16:36,994 --> 01:16:46,596
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't really said much yet, but there is a little bit of speculation that Subversion might be heading that way, which is a game they're currently developing.

1375
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:48,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1376
01:16:49,797 --> 01:16:55,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, there's a rumor going on saying that the next channel possibly for the Wii would be the Nintendo Power channel.

1377
01:16:57,239 --> 01:16:58,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard about this.

1378
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,681
[SPEAKER_09]: That's interesting.

1379
01:17:01,423 --> 01:17:01,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1380
01:17:01,863 --> 01:17:04,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't buy Nintendo Power, so I guess this would be the only way I'd see it.

1381
01:17:06,447 --> 01:17:08,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Anywho... You better have Howard and Esther.

1382
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:16,756
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also another rumor saying that a PS3 will be released to compete with the Xbox 360 Core unit.

1383
01:17:17,817 --> 01:17:23,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It, too, will not feature a hard drive as well, and possibly lower the price down to $250. $250.

1384
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:33,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's kind of cool, because, I mean, you can probably find a laptop hard drive for pretty cheap.

1385
01:17:34,284 --> 01:17:34,865
[SPEAKER_01]: But, whatever.

1386
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:39,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Final Furlong is coming to the Wii.

1387
01:17:39,986 --> 01:17:43,886
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who may not know Final Furlong, Final Furlong is a horse racing game.

1388
01:17:44,307 --> 01:17:47,887
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the arcade, and when you play it, it makes it look like you're fucking a horse.

1389
01:17:48,307 --> 01:17:49,228
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was great!

1390
01:17:49,268 --> 01:17:51,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence, we used to call it the horse sex game.

1391
01:17:51,368 --> 01:17:55,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in this, I guess it would be... Hunt the horse.

1392
01:17:55,669 --> 01:17:55,929
[SPEAKER_01]: You know...

1393
01:17:57,243 --> 01:17:59,405
[SPEAKER_14]: So is this, say, the cowboy ride a horse?

1394
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:14,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, in another Grand Theft Auto negative story, apparently Richard O. Jones, a writer for Black Voice News, wrote concerns about racial stereotypes in video games.

1395
01:18:15,059 --> 01:18:20,744
[SPEAKER_01]: One such video game he's kind of mad at is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, in which Jones...

1396
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:33,137
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it relates to the player who assumes the lead character of Carl Johnson, a down-on-his-luck black criminal who roams the city streets stealing cars and helping gang members knock off rivals in drive-by shootings.

1397
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:39,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but apparently he didn't play the other games where he played other ethnicities doing the same damn thing.

1398
01:18:42,523 --> 01:18:43,463
[SPEAKER_01]: We all hate equally.

1399
01:18:45,404 --> 01:18:45,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Sides.

1400
01:18:46,225 --> 01:18:49,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hate knows no color boundaries.

1401
01:18:50,447 --> 01:18:51,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody hates.

1402
01:18:53,227 --> 01:18:54,788
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be the next Wii channel.

1403
01:18:54,848 --> 01:18:56,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody votes, everybody poops, everybody hates.

1404
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:00,210
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a big bitch board.

1405
01:19:00,271 --> 01:19:01,111
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you hate right now?

1406
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:02,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate OLR.

1407
01:19:03,012 --> 01:19:05,553
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you hate more than anything at this very moment, Rob?

1408
01:19:06,553 --> 01:19:07,013
[SPEAKER_09]: This show.

1409
01:19:07,954 --> 01:19:08,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Chris?

1410
01:19:08,694 --> 01:19:10,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding, I love this show.

1411
01:19:10,355 --> 01:19:15,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see a Wii webcam channel where you can go visit other people's webcams.

1412
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:17,238
[SPEAKER_14]: The Wii porn channel.

1413
01:19:18,799 --> 01:19:20,399
[SPEAKER_14]: For people who have Wiis.

1414
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:21,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Wii Wiis.

1415
01:19:22,318 --> 01:19:25,880
[SPEAKER_09]: PornTube!

1416
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:31,583
[SPEAKER_09]: What I hate more than anything right now is the fact that PornTube upgraded their Flash Player so I can no longer use it on my Wii.

1417
01:19:32,904 --> 01:19:33,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad, huh?

1418
01:19:34,765 --> 01:19:36,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1419
01:19:37,366 --> 01:19:38,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else from anyone?

1420
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:40,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's it.

1421
01:19:40,068 --> 01:19:43,469
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts if we can.

1422
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:50,133
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, before we wrap up the show, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into and supporting Independent Podcast Radio.

1423
01:19:50,455 --> 01:19:54,296
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are awesome, and we do this show for you guys, the loyal ones who listen to us.

1424
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:58,177
[SPEAKER_09]: All we ask, if you like the show, you'll notice no ads on our site.

1425
01:19:58,657 --> 01:20:12,180
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, live 365 ads, we can't control that because we, you know, they pay the royalty fees, so that's a small concession, but it's the site itself, no ads, podcast itself, you know, no ads as it stands right now, and no plans in the foreseeable future, although someday we may have to make money.

1426
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:18,722
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do this show, the goodness of our hearts, all we ask, tell one person about Orange Lounge Radio.

1427
01:20:18,762 --> 01:20:19,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it's your...

1428
01:20:19,801 --> 01:20:23,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Least favorite person in the world, tell them about Orange Lounge Radio so that maybe they'll check it out.

1429
01:20:23,924 --> 01:20:33,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's the only way we can promote, because we don't have the marketing muscle of magazines and television channels and all that stuff.

1430
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:37,513
[SPEAKER_09]: All we have is us and you guys, the OL Army.

1431
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:40,414
[SPEAKER_09]: So, even Marissa's ex.

1432
01:20:40,815 --> 01:20:41,115
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1433
01:20:41,735 --> 01:20:44,317
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell somebody about Orange Lounge Radio, and that's all we ask.

1434
01:20:44,605 --> 01:20:45,306
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1435
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,240
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1436
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:56,988
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's like she's not having a happy time right now if she could she'd drop everything that she's doing and come out here to be less stressed but she's not she's sticking through school which was a really hard decision for her and stuff so if people can send out some good thoughts towards her go to her myspace or something give her a comment or something and make her happy just to let you know just to ease some of it because I think she needs it because I love her and she needs happy

1437
01:21:57,881 --> 01:22:01,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming Nerd says, God, why don't we all trade MySpaces so we can stalk one another?

1438
01:22:02,124 --> 01:22:05,506
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Orange Launch Radio has a MySpace, and you can add us.

1439
01:22:05,626 --> 01:22:08,148
[SPEAKER_09]: It's MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

1440
01:22:08,248 --> 01:22:08,808
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not hard to find.

1441
01:22:08,828 --> 01:22:09,869
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you suck, I'm not adding you.

1442
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:11,570
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1443
01:22:12,531 --> 01:22:15,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, and of course, you know, I love making... Speaking of you suck.

1444
01:22:16,294 --> 01:22:16,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa.

1445
01:22:17,054 --> 01:22:17,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

1446
01:22:17,815 --> 01:22:20,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations on your first full OLR episode.

1447
01:22:20,376 --> 01:22:20,957
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

1448
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:24,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Based on your comments you've been making, you're much more of a gamer than you lead on.

1449
01:22:24,759 --> 01:22:24,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1450
01:22:24,979 --> 01:22:26,621
[SPEAKER_09]: You follow this stuff more than you'd admit.

1451
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:26,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I...

1452
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:29,934
[SPEAKER_09]: You know more about gaming than I think you want to admit.

1453
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:32,356
[SPEAKER_09]: But thanks for coming and for your insight.

1454
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:33,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's your final thought?

1455
01:22:34,137 --> 01:22:35,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yay, this is so much fun.

1456
01:22:35,478 --> 01:22:39,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for putting up with my ass.

1457
01:22:40,142 --> 01:22:43,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And my last... Oh, yay, hugs from Eggsy.

1458
01:22:44,205 --> 01:22:45,126
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought would be...

1459
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:47,615
[SPEAKER_13]: People at me on MySpace.

1460
01:22:47,695 --> 01:22:48,776
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate MySpace, I do.

1461
01:22:49,076 --> 01:22:50,616
[SPEAKER_13]: To be perfectly honest with those that don't like it.

1462
01:22:50,656 --> 01:22:52,697
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's unfortunately a necessary evil.

1463
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:53,097
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

1464
01:22:53,317 --> 01:22:53,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is.

1465
01:22:53,977 --> 01:22:55,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I say the same thing.

1466
01:22:55,218 --> 01:22:56,478
[SPEAKER_09]: It's where the internet goes to die.

1467
01:22:56,498 --> 01:22:57,418
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

1468
01:22:57,438 --> 01:22:58,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was 4chan.

1469
01:22:59,339 --> 01:23:00,919
[SPEAKER_09]: That too.

1470
01:23:01,179 --> 01:23:02,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like cake or death.

1471
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,120
[SPEAKER_09]: 4chan or MySpace.

1472
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,281
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, my final thought is yay.

1473
01:23:06,321 --> 01:23:07,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you to everybody, especially fans.

1474
01:23:08,081 --> 01:23:10,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if you're just fans for my boobies, that's fine too.

1475
01:23:11,045 --> 01:23:12,749
[SPEAKER_13]: It's radio though, so it's hard.

1476
01:23:12,769 --> 01:23:13,611
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really big though.

1477
01:23:14,594 --> 01:23:15,395
[SPEAKER_09]: They are really big.

1478
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:18,803
[SPEAKER_13]: If you like me or if you want to see my boobies, well, not naked.

1479
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:38,069
[SPEAKER_13]: www.myspace.com slash M-A-R-I-S-S-A-M-E-I-Z-E-L or if you don't like Myspace and it's Myspace bad, just like sunlight, M-A-R-I-S-S-A-C-O-N-G-U-S-T-O at gmail.com.

1480
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:38,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Email me.

1481
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:39,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

1482
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:39,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

1483
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:40,491
[SPEAKER_13]: This was so much fun.

1484
01:23:40,551 --> 01:23:41,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you again.

1485
01:23:41,611 --> 01:23:42,371
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

1486
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:46,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll have to play some folk rock on a later episode of Orange Lounge.

1487
01:23:46,373 --> 01:23:47,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I get so many good friends.

1488
01:23:47,373 --> 01:23:48,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Give the listeners some culture.

1489
01:23:49,434 --> 01:23:50,774
[SPEAKER_13]: I've played James Hurley on my show before.

1490
01:23:51,114 --> 01:23:52,054
[SPEAKER_13]: James Hurley is awesome.

1491
01:23:52,174 --> 01:23:53,355
[SPEAKER_13]: And James Lee Stanley is my favorite.

1492
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:54,515
[SPEAKER_14]: He has the best sideburns ever.

1493
01:23:54,995 --> 01:23:55,315
[SPEAKER_13]: He does.

1494
01:23:55,395 --> 01:23:56,016
[SPEAKER_13]: He has pointy sideburns.

1495
01:23:56,036 --> 01:23:57,996
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to play a Marissa song on the next pop-up at the volume.

1496
01:23:58,196 --> 01:23:59,417
[SPEAKER_13]: If Marissa would give me some.

1497
01:23:59,577 --> 01:23:59,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yay.

1498
01:23:59,957 --> 01:24:06,579
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to promote a friend, James Lee Stanley is an awesome musician who put a picture of me in a Jessica Rabbit outfit on his album.

1499
01:24:06,979 --> 01:24:09,300
[SPEAKER_13]: She's got that on her MySpace, too.

1500
01:24:11,204 --> 01:24:11,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

1501
01:24:11,944 --> 01:24:12,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys so much.

1502
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:13,385
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a blast.

1503
01:24:13,445 --> 01:24:13,926
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

1504
01:24:13,946 --> 01:24:14,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for coming.

1505
01:24:14,766 --> 01:24:16,607
[SPEAKER_09]: And ease up on the Guitar Hero hate.

1506
01:24:17,228 --> 01:24:17,768
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1507
01:24:18,108 --> 01:24:18,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought.

1508
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:21,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to play more Crackdown.

1509
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:23,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of the three gangs done.

1510
01:24:23,971 --> 01:24:24,792
[SPEAKER_01]: One last one left.

1511
01:24:25,152 --> 01:24:26,953
[SPEAKER_01]: The Asians are always the hardest to kill.

1512
01:24:28,674 --> 01:24:32,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know how to take that comment or what kind of hate mail we're going to get from that.

1513
01:24:33,417 --> 01:24:35,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Rice Princess, do you have a final thought?

1514
01:24:35,558 --> 01:24:36,759
[SPEAKER_14]: I like British guys.

1515
01:24:38,292 --> 01:24:40,074
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1516
01:25:09,525 --> 01:25:10,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Kirby's my final thought.

1517
01:25:10,786 --> 01:25:11,907
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

1518
01:25:12,928 --> 01:25:19,332
[SPEAKER_14]: If Megzi is listening by any chance, you fully have my sympathy because I am right now working full time, going to school 12 hours a week.

1519
01:25:20,473 --> 01:25:25,957
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually this week I'm taking two extra classes and have to do 10 documented massages by the end of the year.

1520
01:25:26,617 --> 01:25:27,658
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, by the end of March.

1521
01:25:29,019 --> 01:25:31,381
[SPEAKER_14]: And then have to take more classes and then find a way to quit my job.

1522
01:25:33,222 --> 01:25:35,404
[SPEAKER_14]: So I totally feel your pain.

1523
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:36,785
[SPEAKER_14]: I am suffering with you.

1524
01:25:38,584 --> 01:25:39,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Megzi!

1525
01:25:39,284 --> 01:25:41,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, bye.

1526
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:43,187
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1527
01:25:43,667 --> 01:25:46,529
[SPEAKER_09]: That concludes another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
