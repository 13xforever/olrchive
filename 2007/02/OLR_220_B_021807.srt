00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for part B of our podcast.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is the first time you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Remember that we do broadcast in two parts because we tape live on Sunday nights

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for about three hours or as tonight's going maybe about four hours.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There's some bonus stuff that you can only hear when you listen to us live or when you listen to us on our rebroadcast over at www.allgames.com

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which is Mondays at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time and Tuesdays at 9 a.m.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We like all games because it's this big melting pot of independent podcasts on the internet so it's cool.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're happy to be a part of it and we're also happy to bring you some more gaming news so let's get back into it.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah and I don't see this happening anytime soon. I see In The Groove being made by Konami before this ever happens.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But apparently Microsoft's Rare, people are thinking just because Diddy Kong Racing came out and that was made by Rare

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
that more Rare games are going to make their way I guess to the DS.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well probably not the case but according to Microsoft's VP Shane Kim, he spoke to one up and basically told them

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
a cameo or Viva Pinata on DS makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways from a franchise perspective.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think it's fair to say we're going to continue to invest in Viva Pinata but you probably won't see it on the PSP.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would say you probably won't see it on the DS either because that's still a competing system with them I mean.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That seems so weird to me. So you're basically saying people are assuming because of the fact he said that.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And this just further lends that thing that Microsoft is secretly in bed with Nintendo but they are so the bottom

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
because Reggie just keeps regulating on Microsoft that no we don't want to form a partnership with Microsoft

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
we'd rather you buy more of our games and more of our components.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So Microsoft is totally being a submissive bottom in this relationship because now they're talking about

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
oh but Nintendo I'll totally put Viva Pinata inside you.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't know is it just me?

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It would work but first off Viva Pinata the graphics wouldn't look right.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I mean it's just another kind of not really a Pokemon type of game but it's you know your breeding stuff.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't know.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
SSJ100Matt says maybe Microsoft should give Nintendo advice on internet play. You win.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah. Seriously.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Bandit says hey Rare and yes I'm talking with my mouth full I can do that it's partly my show too.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Bandit says hey Rare give me Killer Instinct already.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I say that with a mouth full of donut.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Fuck that you get Banjo-Kazooie.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Ewww.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Kazooie wasn't that bad.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes it was.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mike W says Major Nelson hearts Nintendo.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So does Trixie.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I remember reading on one of Trixie's blogs in the expo.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I have no idea why I was reading Trixie's blog.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I was bored on the internet and that's where I found myself.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Whenever I hear Trixie I think of the stripper in the Rocky Horror Picture Show but never mind.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So I'm like do you perform with the cast?

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Anyway Trixie she wrote like her Christmas list and one of the things on the Christmas list was a Wii.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Then I was like aren't you guys supposed to be competitors?

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So Microsoft again being the submissive big old bottom.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's your thing.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Can I say personally though that I'm actually really impressed at how the Xbox 360 just took off.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I mean again I'm more of a spectator because of little money.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But I mean at the very beginning having an Xbox was just no you know you have a console that freezes.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And everybody's giving crap to all my friends who you know initially went out and bought an Xbox.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And the 360 seems to be kicking some serious ass.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So I mean that seems to be exciting and it's actually something that I enjoyed as well when I started to play it.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think the problem with the classic Xbox can be personified with a comic strip I used to read that hasn't really been updated in a long time.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But if you ever read Spamusement I think the problem with the Xbox was brilliantly summed up in a Spamusement cartoon where it said the subject line.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
For those who don't know Spamusement takes spam email subject lines and make cartoons out of them.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So the spam email subject line was are you man enough for this?

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And what it was is it was an Xbox with a deep fryer attachment.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And that was the problem with the original Xbox is it was too butch.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But the Xbox 360.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And the controller was just too fucking big.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The Xbox 360 you know it's still butch you know it's not gay but it's a little fruity and that's okay.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's got like Viva Pinata.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I was this close actually to getting my boyfriend the Xbox 360.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm too good I got my ex a PSP for Christmas.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was this close to actually getting my boyfriend the 360 because that's what he loves because he loves the Xbox for Christmas.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But well I figured that the Xbox was 300 something odd dollars worth of depreciation.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Whereas the guitar gets worth more.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And also the Xbox 360 is worth a lot of ignoring girlfriend time.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So but you know when the price drops up I'll probably invest in it because people are very happy with them.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh JV Mon sums it up perfectly the 360 is metrosexual.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Not to I hate going back to the well no I don't but not to go too much back to the gay issue.

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But I get a magazine called The Advocate which is basically a gay and lesbian magazine specifically.

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is that Glad's agenda?

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because you know I am a gay gamer I'm not the biggest fan of Glad.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because they have to get their panties ruffled too easy.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't know who it was but they were talking about how video games are starting to bring more of that in.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And they were talking like Bully was one of them Sims 2 but they talked about Gears of War.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Like the two main characters like no one can convince me that those two characters are not boning each other.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well look you know one of the achievements is called I wish I knew how to quit you or like Dom curious.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't remember what it was called something like oh no that was like I can't quit you Dom or something like that.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's one of the achievements in Gears of War.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh my god.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There's subtleties there.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Meg's giving me huge shit about it like they are not.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's nothing major it's just an LOL moment.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's not trying to make a statement or anything like oh Cliffy B is like secretly a gay supporter.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Maybe he is I don't who cares it's a video game who cares.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't tear away my boyfriend from Gears of War at Best Buy does that make him kind of gay?

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You can tear away your microphone with gay.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Because I'll totally go for the guy that said he'd marry me for like an adventure game.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I got gay from Rob a long time ago with the Pepsi bong.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Alright anyhow.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Golf Land.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm being asked by several people please tell me you aren't a crab person.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No well both of us because we are both gay.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Did you ever see an episode of South Park with the crab people?

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Queer Eye?

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Never mind.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do we ever talk video games on the show?

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes we do once in a while and this is a very interesting sort of game that's coming to the DS.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
There's a new brand of toys in Japan called Treasure Gaust and it's going to be coming to the DS.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Well get this.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You remember how like Boktai used Sunlight and there was another game in Japan that used bar codes?

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This game uses natural magnetic fields to build your Pokemon-ish type creatures.

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So the game is encouraging you to find the Earth's natural magnetic fields to build your monster.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Dude that's interesting but I did not like Boktai.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Lunar Nights looks kind of cool or actually I played Lunar Nights it was kind of fun but Boktai was not fun for me.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Take your DS to a power plant.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Or get a blacklight in your house because that thing will send that thing off the rockets.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I wonder if a fridge magnet will fuck with this game.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Do they have those stones that make noise?

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So there you go Treasure Gaust coming to the DS.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Boy the DS now really does everything.

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well that's kind of cool though because it's like degausting your monitor by now.

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's certainly something new.

118
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Well here is something new but not really.

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We get more Harvest Moon.

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Da award of the week.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Harvest Moon DS will be out on the 13th of April.

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I know at least in the UK I'm not sure if that's also playing to the US because I got my information off of UK stuff.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:17,000
However it's more cows and more sheep and you get tutorials on how to raise your animals and plant seeds and crops and make money on your farm.

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Fall asleep while playing a video game.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And have sex with Harvest Sprites and the Witch Princess.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm awake.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No really.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And then you can actually get married in the game.

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You have 25 villagers and you can go fishing.

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And all they do is just nag you the fucking tend to the animals.

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You can probably you know hump the sheep or something.

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
All they do is stay at home and watch Oprah while you're out milking the cow.

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I have a Harvest Moon sheep.

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I do.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He sleeps by my bed with Stitch.

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Gaming Nerd says I'm buying this game.

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There you go.

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
John Dorian says I think Harvest Moon for the DS already came out.

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't know if this is a new one.

140
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think this is a new one.

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There's a new Harvest Moon game every year on every platform so you know it's the same fucking thing every time.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry I'm not a big Harvest Moon fan if you can't already tell.

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I find the game to be incredibly boring yet I love Animal Crossing.

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So obviously my taste in games is fucked I admit it.

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Evangelicals love Animal Crossing.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Evangelicals love Animal Crossing?

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why would Evangelicals?

148
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You should have seen the shit we were doing in Animal Crossing.

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I got one of my animals to always say you cunt after everything they said.

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Can I have a fish you cunt?

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And then like we painted gay pride symbols and put them all over town.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Remember the girls in my village who was their village lesbian?

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
My Animal Crossing village was an evangelical nightmare.

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
On my DS one though we had our village lesbian and when she moved out we cried.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No I remember that.

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's because I hit her with a bug net so much.

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
She went to Julie's village and she was a PE teacher.

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
She had gym equipment.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's right she had gym equipment in her house.

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
She was such a lesbian.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And so we made a little rainbow sign to be outside of her house.

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you know why Animal Crossing is sick?

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Because we're talking about these people like they're real.

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You know you liked Olivia.

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's the one I think I got to say you cunt after everything.

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There's nothing funnier than getting video game characters to say shit and poop.

168
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yay!

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
How about peepee caca?

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Anyway.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I had one that said that.

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So, Capcom.

173
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, they're awesome.

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They used to have a studio called Clover which put out such games like Okami, Viewtiful Joe,

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
fun stuff like that.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well of course you remember Clover went bye bye.

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,880
But now the four members of Clover have formed a brand new studio called Seeds and no projects

178
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,140
have been announced from them yet but of course you know features such a wonderful talent

179
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:10,480
as Sushi Nabi or Naba which he worked on Viewtiful Joe, Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami and Devil

180
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:18,800
McRise, Hideki Kamiya and I probably butchered those names but should be interesting.

181
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,640
Hopefully we get some more original games kind of like actually they worked on what

182
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
was it?

183
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Gun Hand was?

184
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,960
I think that was the name of that.

185
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
God Hand.

186
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
That's what it was.

187
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,360
That was okay.

188
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,440
But yeah, awesome.

189
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,480
More studios making more games.

190
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,720
I have on another completely different tangent, I have the news that might save PlayStation

191
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,120
3 and here it is.

192
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,800
There's a rumor going around that there are because based off reports from Japan that

193
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,020
the head of the Sony financial division is suggesting that a PlayStation 3 price cut

194
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,020
in 2007 may be on the way.

195
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,500
Now it seems like there's a story about this like every other week but this one's really

196
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,880
been circulating around the different blogs so we hope there's a little bit of truth to

197
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,480
it but the honest end of it is if there is a price cut coming it's probably not till

198
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,880
Christmas because they'll try to lie to fire under PS3 sales.

199
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,400
They're going to have to because Halo 3 is going to be a big problem.

200
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,180
I would say if they want to be smart they'll cut it the same day or I mean they'll cut

201
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:32,480
the price of the PlayStation 3 the same day as the Halo 3 comes out.

202
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,040
That would be the best thing ever.

203
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,480
We'll see what happens.

204
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,960
Well as for other things that we're seeing happening and I really wish we weren't seeing

205
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,840
this happen there's an Aqua Teen Hunger Force game on the PS2 and this is what you get for

206
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,960
drinking beer milkshakes.

207
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:59,600
Yeah it's a golfing game I know it's just extreme combat golf they call it.

208
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,440
Who's story is this?

209
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,280
Okay till it's warm at the game Jamie go right ahead.

210
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,080
Can I say something completely random first?

211
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,120
Jamie likes to do that to my stories.

212
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,520
This has nothing to do with gaming at all but you know how in Rocky Horror Picture Show

213
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,240
at the end you always have like if you ever go see it live in the theater when Riff Raff

214
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,460
and Magenta come back into the they're sometimes dressed up as famous couples or some type

215
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,120
of coupling like you know maybe they'll come like well I remember one time when I actually

216
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,240
performed as Riff Raff we came out as the characters from Brokeback Mountain and you

217
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,440
know just like couples like that well last night they came out in these giant cardboard

218
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,440
cutouts of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and it was the best gold scene I'd ever seen in my life.

219
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,560
Jenna is papayas!

220
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,880
Something like that.

221
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,680
Sorry that was that random moment was brought to you.

222
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,760
I was just sort of in shock because I'm like it's bad enough that it's Aqua Teen Hunger

223
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,880
Force but they have to just completely turn the state in my heart and making it combat

224
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,520
golf with sawed-off shotguns.

225
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Um Midway stop taking the LSD please.

226
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,800
You are not a hero.

227
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
You cannot tell the future through Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

228
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,900
Lay off the drugs.

229
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,560
Next please.

230
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,320
I want to read some comments from chat real quick going to let's see back to the PlayStation

231
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
3 story.

232
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,280
Let's have T says PlayStation 3 needs a price cut.

233
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,320
That's the only way that it might become a real threat to Microsoft.

234
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,640
SSJ 100 Matt says Aqua Teen Hunger Force game the only game that won't be in Boston.

235
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,680
To which WB Bulldogs tags along to that the Boston scare was a bunch of bullshit.

236
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,760
Media blowing things out of proportion.

237
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,040
Got the show a lot of visibility although I hear it didn't help in the ratings that's

238
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
too bad.

239
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,240
Well the ratings are doing pretty good as it is.

240
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,040
I mean yeah the show is doing fine as it is so what can you do?

241
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Anyways.

242
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Cool!

243
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
Megatox is going to let me borrow a hotel desk.

244
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
I don't want to play this.

245
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,600
Oh I want a game!

246
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
You mean book.

247
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I can't have the game.

248
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
He's loaning it to me.

249
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm taking it back and burning it.

250
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Oh game lust!

251
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,720
Neek Latov says I'm not allowed to rub the game against my chest.

252
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,600
Do you want to say anything real quick because you haven't been on the show really?

253
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,400
We had everybody like Grand Central Station through here in part A.

254
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,280
Are we still talking about video games?

255
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,480
Once in a while.

256
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,360
We just talked about the Aqua Teen Hunger Force game and well Loki's going to be getting

257
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
in the next story.

258
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,840
You want to say anything?

259
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,400
First I'm super excited for Silent Hill the shooty game because it's got Pyramid Head

260
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,220
and secondly I'm super excited because I got hit on tonight that was fun.

261
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,800
The end.

262
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,880
Maybe some chatters will hit on you.

263
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
You should send your pic.

264
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,120
Oh no you're in our top on Myspace.

265
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,440
Here you go.

266
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Alright anyway sorry.

267
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Well fuck you.

268
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,320
Alright sorry.

269
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,660
So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio please don't let this

270
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,520
be representative of every show.

271
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,360
Every time I'm on this frickin' show you say that Rob.

272
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,480
Every single time.

273
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,360
It doesn't mean anything I swear.

274
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Heart.

275
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Broken.

276
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,800
Oh okay I get to read a story now.

277
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
That's great.

278
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,560
Anyways apparently the team behind Ico is working on a brand new title for the PS3.

279
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:21,220
People are hoping that it's a brand new version of Shadow Colossus or even Ico.

280
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,500
Although it's probably going to be something original that looks yet very similar to both

281
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,760
those two games.

282
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,880
No word on what it is but we know that they're working on something.

283
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,960
There's something coming soon.

284
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,240
You gotta love gaming news like that.

285
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,000
Something is coming.

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,080
Something is coming to the PlayStation 3 and it's got a big schnauzer.

287
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
It's Qbert.

288
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Perverts.

289
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,680
Qbert's coming to the PlayStation 3 on February 22nd, hey that's this week, $4.99 undercutting

290
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,800
the cost of the average Microsoft game by one cent.

291
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,640
Good job Sony.

292
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,000
And of course Qbert will have the online leaderboards.

293
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,120
It's going to be in 720p and apparently players will be fighting against each other to see

294
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,840
who can be the supreme noser because that's the number one personal leaderboard is the

295
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,960
supreme noser.

296
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,040
I'm sorry, Qbert jumped the shark when they had the Qbert cartoon although that was kind

297
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
of cool.

298
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
But I do love the Qbert game.

299
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,080
I do love the fact that Sony can't really say anything about their PlayStation network

300
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,400
right now because there's nothing on it.

301
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Nothing.

302
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,520
There's nothing on there.

303
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,760
There's like six games and a few demos and that's it.

304
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,320
To be honest, the fucking Nintendo network has more stuff on it than the Sony network.

305
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,800
I mean, come on, put out some more shit.

306
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,160
I don't care if this is stuff that's already been on like the 360 or whatever.

307
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
More games.

308
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Seriously.

309
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
More demos.

310
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,760
I mean, full auto 2 demo.

311
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,540
Only months after the game came out, hooray, and you know what, the game still sucks.

312
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,320
And I don't know, they just need more shit.

313
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,120
Qbert is not filling the void that they need.

314
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
More original stuff.

315
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,760
And no PSP ports.

316
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,040
Top it with the goddamn PSP ports.

317
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:24,120
Well why don't we move away from Sony's stinky poop pile of a camp and go to the Nintendo

318
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,200
world.

319
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,520
Although this is actually pretty poopy too.

320
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Cooking Mama Cook Off has actually been pushed back, sorry, in Europe.

321
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
Sorry Europe.

322
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,280
The original release date was March 29th, now it's pushed back to May 10th.

323
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,840
They are not listing a reason.

324
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,200
That's really crappy, isn't it?

325
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Don't worry Europe.

326
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Mama will fix it.

327
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,040
I had to, sorry.

328
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,920
We love you Europe.

329
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,720
Even though we don't like the band.

330
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,360
Okay, well, you know, news of Cooking Mama getting delayed, even if it doesn't directly

331
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,240
affect us here in the US, we feel you're angst, our listeners overseas.

332
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,360
We feel you're angst, and therefore we dedicate this FUs of the Week segment to our overseas

333
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:28,560
listeners.

334
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,760
Dark Sakura, start us off with the angst.

335
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,800
Fuck you to accidents, because I banged my wrist into a big metal pole today and I had

336
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,960
a big bruise, and now I have a big soul and scald on my hand from your freaking tea, Rob.

337
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,920
You didn't have to, but it was yummy, thank you.

338
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
I didn't buy it.

339
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Oh, thank you.

340
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,400
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, um, FU to having to pay $800 to buy on the talk

341
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
table.

342
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Loki!

343
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:11,240
Um, I don't really have anything, other than, I guess, um, FU people that can't, you know,

344
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,720
abide by street dates, you know, I know that's a bit, you know, hypocritical, but yeah, anyway,

345
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
it's an exception.

346
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,920
Because you see, the rules state that you cannot sell it, rent it, or, um, make it available

347
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,240
to the public, you know, in that form.

348
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,000
Playing it is not on there.

349
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,160
Playing it is okey-dokey, so that's all I did was play it.

350
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,040
I didn't sell it or rent it, so I'm off scuffery.

351
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,880
But anyways, um, other people though, even people that should know better, like some

352
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,480
of the CompUSA's and EB games out there, it's, there's a big fucking sticker on it that says

353
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,640
do not sell before 2.20, don't be a dumb fuck, I mean, you're not getting paid that much

354
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,960
money to do your job, and I mean, and honestly, no one gives a shit if you have the game,

355
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
you know, days before everybody else.

356
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,600
No one's gonna forget it, you know, down the line anyways, so, who gives a crap?

357
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,640
But I need more people to buy this game, so I can play with them on time, so it's gonna

358
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
be fun.

359
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm thinking about it, but 60 bucks is a lot to spend, I mean, look how much I play

360
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Gears of War.

361
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,240
It, it, it's fun, it really is fun.

362
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
I'll think about it.

363
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,720
You gotta bring your copy over so I can play.

364
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Alright.

365
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,800
Um, my view of the week goes to my voice, because I'm losing it again, and that sucks,

366
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,440
because, um, you know, for those that say I talk too much on this show, do realize I'm

367
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,760
used to talking all day and getting paid for it for a living, uh, in the teaching world,

368
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,720
so, uh, yeah, I'm losing my voice and having to go to my day job tomorrow, it's gonna kinda

369
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
suck.

370
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Luckily I can just give my class a test.

371
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I'm off, Rob.

372
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Well, you suck.

373
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,480
I'll be, I'll be at, at home enjoying my day off for you.

374
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
Good.

375
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,800
You have fun with that, bitch.

376
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Alright.

377
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
I mean, I love you, Rissa!

378
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Hi!

379
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Yay!

380
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,640
You're, you're inaugural FUs of the week, what do you wanna angst on?

381
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,400
Ooh, yeah, I get to break my FU of the week, sorry.

382
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,000
It's funny, because, um, as my friends like to say, um, after work, I love to get my hate

383
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,440
on, but I'm having such a good time being up here up north, of NorCal rules, and SoCal's

384
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,800
rules, for the moment, I'm an LA native, um, but my FU of the week is so funny, because

385
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,280
I hate, I hate that I love to get my hate on, as my, yeah.

386
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Let it all out, baby, let it all out.

387
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Let it all out!

388
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I'm, like, in a slayer, what can I say?

389
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,360
Uh, I guess my FU of the week can go to my ex-boyfriend, not because I'm bitter, okay,

390
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,000
I am a little bit, but, uh, cuz he has every reason, which one, huh, oh, not him, oh, cuz

391
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,120
I was gonna say that one, you have every reason.

392
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,960
Oh, FU of the week to him too, but, uh, David, AKA S.S.

393
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,640
Caley and big, uh, gamer, g-gamer nerd, and he likes to make anime and music videos, and

394
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:49,000
instead of, and he probably does, that's why I'm doing it, and instead of going out, which

395
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,120
is okay, because I would pay for everything anyway, and I got on the PSP, because you

396
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,440
know why, because I am the best ex-boyfriend ever, but, uh, we used to play the green cast

397
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,920
on the lawn instead of going anywhere, and, well, cuz I wasn't allowed to go in the house

398
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,040
and put the green cast on the lawn.

399
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,200
Oh, and, um, and FU of the week to people, um, with Honda's, because I love my Honda,

400
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,360
but putting a fart can on your Honda, okay, Honda's are great, Honda's are fantastic,

401
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,960
I love it, but they're economical, and, and, and good on gas, but they're not FU-ing racing

402
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,840
shoes, so, yeah.

403
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,040
And last but not least, some, uh, lesbian FUs from Chris.

404
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:34,000
Uh, I have, I have, uh, two quick ones, I won't be too long, uh, one, FU to, uh, the

405
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,960
Scientology Center for fucking roping my father into it, leave my father alone, he's old,

406
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,360
he's bitter, and he has money, knock the fuck off, I'm so sick of those people, and, uh,

407
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,960
FU of the week to me, because...

408
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,960
You sure are awesome.

409
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:58,760
Yeah, but, I don't, I wish I could do more for Meg D. I know I've rinsed out stuff, like,

410
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,360
every week that I'm on here with Meg D, but she lives in Wisconsin, she goes to school

411
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,480
full-time, she's at work part-time, and she's got ASUN coming up where she's being in costume

412
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,880
and stuff like that, and she's just so stressed out, and I FU to me for not being able to

413
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,840
do something to help her more.

414
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,120
You know what, she's got, she's obviously got a gal who loves her very much, and, you

415
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,080
know, a lot of people in this world are not that lucky, so, you know, that's what she

416
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
can do.

417
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,640
I just wish I could do more for her.

418
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,960
I hate not being there when she's sitting there, you know, just stressed out, it's so

419
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
infuriating.

420
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,640
Oh, she's gonna come out here, and then you guys are gonna get married and have 10,000

421
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,120
babies, so, you know.

422
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Fuck yeah.

423
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
And they're all mine!

424
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
They're all gonna be named Mr. Sinister.

425
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,720
No, no, she wants a child and name it Mr. Sinister to guarantee she never has children,

426
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,440
I will be popping them out the fucking next day.

427
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Wow.

428
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
She'll enjoy that.

429
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,840
Somehow we went from I love my girlfriend so much to fuck you, Maisie, fuck you right

430
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
in your earhole.

431
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,200
She knows I love her, I bought her a pink leather collar.

432
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,040
I love Maisie, too, she's great.

433
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,680
I'm sorry, I have one last fuck you of the week, and that's to Gears of War for hypnotizing

434
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
my boyfriend.

435
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,600
He never wants to leave the fucking Best Buy.

436
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,200
Oh, Gears of War, awwww.

437
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
So yeah.

438
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Anyone else?

439
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,080
I need a new boyfriend, any volunteers?

440
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,920
It's a popular game.

441
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,600
Well, I don't swing that way, but like, I'll pose in pictures and stuff so you can tell

442
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,920
your family that, you know, I've, what, at Disneyland?

443
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,680
Yeah, I remember that girl of my friends that met you, she asked, she's like, is that Jamie's

444
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
husband?

445
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,800
That was the best thing ever.

446
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Who?

447
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Carolyn.

448
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Oh, my stalker.

449
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,640
Carolyn, your little stalker, asked if Rob, I don't know.

450
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,960
Yeah, apparently I was Jamie's husband.

451
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,800
Apparently you were Jamie's husband, I'm sorry, Rob, I love you to death, but you're gay and

452
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
you act it!

453
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
How could you?

454
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
I am not gay!

455
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
What are you talking about?

456
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,400
How can anyone mistake you for her husband?

457
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Sorry.

458
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Alright, I'm done.

459
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Alright.

460
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Back to gaming news.

461
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,880
Because they couldn't hear him talk in the picture.

462
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:12,120
In fact, on my Myspace, Chris left me a comment where I'm holding the gay lightsaber from

463
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Disneyland because it was a-

464
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,000
I had it in my bin once.

465
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,880
It says, use the gay force, Rob.

466
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh, I need to add that to my pictures now that I have 300 pictures, so I'm going to

467
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
do that.

468
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Alright, sorry.

469
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,560
Gaming news, anybody, somebody, help!

470
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,720
Anyways, so out of all the retarded shit that come out for gamers, this has to be up there

471
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,600
with some of them.

472
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:41,760
Headshot, the energy bar, yes, you too can buy a fucking energy bar called Headshot and

473
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,640
be super cool because you eat fucking energy bars that have to do with gaming, while you're

474
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
gaming.

475
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,800
Ooh, you're fucking awesome.

476
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,240
And you know, while you're at it, why don't you wash that headshot down with some balls.

477
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,760
Dude, that sounds like fun!

478
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:06,880
Come on, Shami, I know I'm your husband, but can I drink some balls?

479
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,000
You know, we should tell Mr. Spanky about it, Rob.

480
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,080
We should tell Mr. Spanky about that.

481
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,040
Alright, anyhow, yeah, Headshot, wow, that's something else.

482
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:28,320
Oh, and that was the other thing, I believe it was this website, uncommonloot.com, that

483
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:36,160
was running the story about that, and it looks so awful, probably tastes like ass, too.

484
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Some people like the taste of ass.

485
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,640
You're like ass, well we have the drink for you.

486
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,080
Wasn't there a drink on Engrish.com or something that was A-S-S-E or something?

487
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,440
No, it was a type of candy.

488
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,920
Macari Sweat's actually really good.

489
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Wait, what was it going to say?

490
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
What was it?

491
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,520
Oh, Rob D. in chat said, if Rob and Jamie were married, one of them would be dead by

492
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,560
now.

493
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
So true.

494
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
That would be Rob.

495
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
So true.

496
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Well, really.

497
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:13,200
Anyhow, let's get into some PC gaming news, because I know it's been a pretty interesting

498
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,960
show tonight with some very random stuff, but there's nothing more hardcore than PC

499
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,080
gaming, because seriously, PC gamer fans are foaming at the mouth hardcore, not that there's

500
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,880
anything wrong with that.

501
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,840
Myst Online went live this week.

502
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,720
This is a game a lot of folks have been like, ooh, even Marissa's gassed me there.

503
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,880
No, Myst is not dead.

504
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,240
Through the service GameTap, you can play Myst Online, it's $9.95 a month for GameTap,

505
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,520
and you get access to hundreds of games, not just this.

506
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,440
It launched on February 15th.

507
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,120
Right now, it's only available to GameTap subscribers, but apparently, they're going

508
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,040
to make the game available as a direct download in other countries, because right now GameTap's

509
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,600
only available in the US and Canada, and there's folks overseas that want to play this game.

510
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,280
Australia, Japan, wherever they are, they want to play this game as well.

511
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,120
So they're looking into options, Turner, who runs GameTap.

512
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
So that's pretty awesome.

513
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,240
That's so great to hear about Myst so many years later.

514
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I can't believe it's still around.

515
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,640
I mean, I heard about the sequels, but it is kind of funny, though, since the original

516
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,640
game is very solitary and very lonely, and now you're communicating with other people.

517
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,680
I have the parody version, though, pissed.

518
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
Wow.

519
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,040
No, I actually really want to check this out.

520
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,960
I'm going to really try to play this and review it for next week's show, because I keep saying,

521
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
oh, I've got to play Sam and Max.

522
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,760
I really need to spend some quality time with GameTap, but I keep going back to wow, because

523
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
it's crack.

524
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Huh?

525
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Add it.

526
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Or crack.

527
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Sorry.

528
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,440
Anyway, well, just a little bit of information.

529
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,080
For fans of Gears of War who have a PC, it's eventually going to be on the PC.

530
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,200
It was actually confirmed by Epyc's VP, Mark Raine, said that it's not just a rumor, it's

531
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,240
going to happen, just not soon.

532
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,220
They just said it's inevitable.

533
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,560
I guess it's not a really big surprise.

534
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,440
I mean, you know, it's one of Microsoft's biggest, if they want more people to come

535
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,560
over to the PC bandwagon, you know, why not put something out for those that don't have

536
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
the 360.

537
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,680
Gears of War is a huge title.

538
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Makes perfect sense.

539
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,720
I don't know why it took them this long to simply acknowledge it.

540
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,100
Anyways, so there's going to be a brand new action-oriented role-playing game coming

541
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,000
out to the PC.

542
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,080
Silver Fall by Atari and Monte Cristo Games is finally gone gold.

543
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,360
It's scheduled to be released on March 20th and will retail for $39.95.

544
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,560
It actually looks pretty cool, kind of a little fantasy mixed with technology type of role-playing

545
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
game.

546
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,720
It's kind of like a Final Fantasy.

547
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,280
Plus, the cover has boobs on it, so you got to buy it because of the boobies, you know.

548
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
What do you think, Jamie?

549
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Let me see.

550
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,320
Not bad, she probably has back problems.

551
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:06,280
Well, if you've been wanting to make a boob out of yourself, you might want to check out

552
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:13,240
Rayman Raving Rabbids on the Xbox 360 because it's going to be using the vision camera.

553
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,240
There will be gesture-based games for 37 of the minigames in Rayman Raving Rabbids.

554
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,400
So that's, I guess, its answer to, you know, the Wii, because it's not going to have the

555
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,440
Wii controls, so that's something a little different.

556
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
So there you have it.

557
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,320
You know, where the Wii does not have a camera, now you're going to get this on the Xbox 360.

558
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
That's going to be interesting.

559
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
That's going to work fantastic.

560
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,320
Yeah, I know.

561
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:38,840
Those camera games are not that great, but Rayman Raving Rabbids doesn't exactly have

562
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,520
a lot of, like, I would think in translating some of those games, there's not a lot of

563
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,600
motion-intensive stuff in that game, you know what I mean?

564
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,040
Like I can't imagine there would be that much motion.

565
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,720
There's a lot of motion going on in that game.

566
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,160
Never mind, forget it.

567
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Just don't buy it.

568
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
It's a horrible game.

569
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Alright, I'll do that.

570
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
I'll do that.

571
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Let's see.

572
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:08,960
Let's go on to Dark Sockra's website of the week.

573
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,880
I was reading, I was trying to see if there was good chat comments, sorry if I sounded

574
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
a spy track.

575
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
No, they're talking about breasts.

576
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
They're all talking about boobs.

577
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,160
Although, I do have to say, like, holy shit, it's Boobs Get in the Car from GS68.

578
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,800
My rebuttal to that was going to the Boobs BRB.

579
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,240
Alright, well, I also want to hear your rebuttal to the website of the week, because every

580
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,280
week Dark Sockra surfs the website up and down and left and right to find her favorite

581
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
website.

582
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,160
I don't know if it will be Doctor Who related this week.

583
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,280
We will soon find out.

584
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Here we go.

585
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Yes, she does surf the website up and down.

586
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Did I say the web?

587
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Shut up.

588
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,280
The website of the week is the Orange Dogs Radio Forum.

589
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
No.

590
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,360
You know, Rob, Rob, stop the music, stop the music.

591
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,240
The website of the week is very personal to me, very important, and you know, I think

592
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,520
that we're forgetting the presence of greatness in our lives.

593
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:11,960
We should all bow down and pay homage to our Lord and Master, the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

594
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,040
Bless him, he has fostered us, Robin!

595
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,920
Oh my God, yes!

596
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,160
So the site dedicated to our noodley Lord and Master...

597
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,920
I am a pasta-fari, and I must confess, blessed be his noodley goodness, ramen.

598
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
The site is...

599
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,240
What the fuck happened to this show?

600
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,360
Seriously, what fucking show am I on?

601
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,360
In the name of the noodle, I beseech thee to shut the fuck up.

602
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
I love carbohydrates.

603
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,560
Carbohydrates are so good.

604
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:52,360
The site is www.venganza.org.

605
00:34:52,360 --> 00:35:01,340
For a little bit of history, the great one was discovered through a series of detections

606
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,320
along the same lines as Intelligent Design.

607
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,160
And if Intelligent Design can't exist, why can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster?

608
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,880
Just for a brief commercial for pasta-farianism, our heaven has a beer volcano and a stripper

609
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,040
factory.

610
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:29,180
So I recommend that everybody, or just worship the IPU, whatever, just go visit the site

611
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:35,640
and soon you will become one of us, because hey, if, you know, Scientology exists, why

612
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,520
can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster?

613
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,240
Wait, there's actually a million dollar prize if you can prove that the Flying Spaghetti

614
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
Monster does not exist.

615
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
There's no way to do it.

616
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,920
No.

617
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,720
In fact, there's tons of photographic evidence on the site.

618
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,320
Yeah, like drawings.

619
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,320
So...

620
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,040
No, there's real life pictures.

621
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,360
If we go out to dinner at the Olive Garden, and I decide I don't like my food, because

622
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,160
Olive Garden's food does taste a little bit, you know, rank.

623
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,160
It's an insult to Italians.

624
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,200
Did you ever see that episode with the Playboy Bunnies, and they asked the Playboy Bunny,

625
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,200
what was that show?

626
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Hugh Hefner Knows Best or something?

627
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Playboy Knows Best?

628
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
I don't remember what it was.

629
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,120
And they asked the one Playboy Boy and what her favorite Italian restaurant is, and she

630
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,000
says the Olive Garden, and everybody's like, oh my god, what the hell's wrong?

631
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,320
So anyway, if I were to, like, get upset with my food and pick up a big hunk of spaghetti

632
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,080
and throw it at Jamie, could I yell Flying Spaghetti Monster and everything would be

633
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,160
okay?

634
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Because we have...

635
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
This has the best Valentine on it.

636
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,000
It says, I love you, but you must die.

637
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,280
Bob, the best part about Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is that we have flimsy moral standards.

638
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,800
Can I get gay married in Pastafarian?

639
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Absolutely.

640
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Absolutely.

641
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Can't you be ordained in Pastafarian?

642
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,920
Well, you can be ordained in anything, God bless Pastafarian.

643
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
That's it.

644
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,280
I'm a registered minister in California.

645
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,960
Wasn't that from an episode of South Park?

646
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,600
By the end of March, I will be an ordained minister of Pastafarianism.

647
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
Wait a minute.

648
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,680
This is an episode of South Park where Mrs. Garrison says something about the Flying Spaghetti

649
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
Monster.

650
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,680
I remember this distinctly.

651
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
The Flying Spaghetti Monster.

652
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,400
It came about when someone was trying...

653
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,720
The whole thing with the...

654
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Intelligent design.

655
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Intelligent design.

656
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,200
You know, God invented the earth and that kind of thing, and they're trying to teach

657
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,000
it in schools.

658
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's like, that's bullshit.

659
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's not science.

660
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Whatever.

661
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,340
You may believe it's not science.

662
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,340
There's nothing to back it up.

663
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,480
So these guys said, well, shit, we might as well have a pasta creature that can fly around

664
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,440
and has a beer volcano in it.

665
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,200
And they used the same type of disjointed argument, the intelligent design.

666
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,120
Every time you talk about a Spaghetti Monster, I think about Pizza the Hutt from Spaceballs.

667
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
Yeah!

668
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
That guy scares me.

669
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
He ate himself.

670
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:48,440
I actually think that Pizza the Hutt is one of the avatars of his noodly goodness.

671
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,920
It was fully inspired, I think.

672
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,120
It's a funny sight.

673
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,560
Go see it, God damn it.

674
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,680
I have been touched by the noodly appendage.

675
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:04,520
I think next week, we'll be changing the name of the show from Orange Lounge Radio Video

676
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,080
Game Radio to Orange Lounge Radio from What the Fuck Ever.

677
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Sorry, Rob.

678
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
No, it's all right.

679
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
It's funny.

680
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,080
I'm not going to be on the show next week, so it's okay.

681
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
No, it's all right.

682
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Last week was just as bad.

683
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,120
You know, folks in chat seem to be digging it, so whatever.

684
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,440
As long as they're happy, Rob.

685
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
As long as they're happy.

686
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
I love you, Jamie!

687
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
That's right.

688
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
As long as the masses are pleased.

689
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,440
I mean, we can't talk about video games all day long.

690
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,880
I mean, you have to have a life outside of games.

691
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Really?

692
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,080
Or else when will you ever get an orgasm?

693
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Seriously.

694
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Whee!

695
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Whee!

696
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
I found that.

697
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
I'm not going to say that on air.

698
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,080
But we are going to get back into some gaming news.

699
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
Are we?

700
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Loki?

701
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
Yes?

702
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Yes, if someone gives me a microphone.

703
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,400
Anyways, so that wonderful game that I've been playing, Crackdown.

704
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,720
It only has 900 achievement points.

705
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
It is missing 100 of them.

706
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,120
I know, everyone pause.

707
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,360
That's tragic news, but they are coming later on in a free downloadable thing.

708
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,380
What they're going to be doing for the last 100 points, well, they don't really know yet.

709
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,180
What they're doing is watching how people play the game, kind of like a Big Brother

710
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,440
sort of thing, and they're going to figure out some achievements based on that.

711
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,760
So for example, if you're into say, kicking objects really high into the air with your

712
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,800
character, like say pipes on a rooftop, into oncoming traffic or stuff like that, that

713
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,720
could become an achievement later on.

714
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,080
Or I don't know, punting people over a bridge or something, I don't know.

715
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,860
As long as there's not some dumbass achievement for 1,000 people in the lobby at once.

716
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,880
I don't think there is a lobby in this game.

717
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,160
I know, but I'm making reference to that one.

718
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Yes, that's retarded.

719
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
That was stupid.

720
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Do you know why they did that?

721
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,040
Because they were hoping they sold 1,000 copies of NBA Live or something.

722
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,480
Well apparently they did, because the community came together and got it done.

723
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Good job.

724
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Yeah, worldwide.

725
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,920
I don't know.

726
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,720
All bought by Achievement Point Horse.

727
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,880
To be honest though, Crackdown's achievements, they're not that hard.

728
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
They're pretty easy.

729
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,660
Well, I know Loki likes Crackdown a whole lot, but there's only a few things I can think

730
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,000
of that are even better than Crackdown, Loki must agree.

731
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:32,240
Now one of them would be zombies, and there's only one thing better than zombies, believe

732
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,040
it or not, and that would be Hideo Kojima.

733
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:42,880
Would you believe that the meeting of this awesomeness, these two worlds of awesome could

734
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:53,400
be in the near future?

735
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,240
The zombie idea I have is a bit different.

736
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,400
Imagine a large town where half the inhabitants are zombies.

737
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,440
Users would subscribe, get inside the town, and get bitten.

738
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,560
At that stage they become undead and can't control their character.

739
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,660
All they can do is modify the camera angles.

740
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,160
They would see their character attacking humans and have to pay to just watch.

741
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,920
The only way they could end it is by opening another account, hunting themselves down and

742
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,340
killing themselves.

743
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,360
Of course, the problem is that your second character can get bitten as well.

744
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,320
Wasn't this already done in a Resident Evil game?

745
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,960
I think of Infected for PSP for some reason.

746
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,960
I want to say a Resident Evil game that was played online.

747
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Outbreak?

748
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,560
Yeah, I think it might have been Outbreak, where if you did get bitten or whatever,

749
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,820
that you wouldn't be able to control your character or something like that.

750
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,960
I want to say that that was Outbreak.

751
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,280
Well Hideo Kojima says, quote, he's going to take some time to prepare a zombie title

752
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,440
if the timing's right.

753
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Just take that very seriously.

754
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,260
Listen, here's what you need to do, and I'm telling you, this is going to be way better

755
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,560
than that stupid zombie game.

756
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,080
Okay, Hideo Kojima's Adventures in Nudie Island, because you're going to have, picture this,

757
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,160
half the residents, hot naked chicks, okay?

758
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,680
You would have people subscribing four times just to have four different people in this

759
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,840
fucking island, and I tell you, that is going to be better than any fucking zombie game

760
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
ever.

761
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Beauty and the Geek MMO?

762
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
And you know what happens?

763
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:22,880
And if you get bitten by the naked chicks, if you're into that kind of thing, then you

764
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,560
turn into another naked chick or something.

765
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,720
Isn't the downside, though, that half of those quote-unquote naked chicks are men playing

766
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
as naked chicks?

767
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,160
That would be me.

768
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,360
I always play women in MMOs, always.

769
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:43,400
That's why, I don't know, the naked chicks would be only controlled by AI, so it'd never

770
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
be men playing.

771
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,120
Oh, so you're never actually having real sex, ever?

772
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,720
It doesn't matter, you're never having real sex in this game anyways.

773
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,480
If you want real sex, go and fucking get a woman.

774
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,080
Festering Rash in our chat, which I believe is just DMN under a different name, says,

775
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,360
Loki, it's called Second Life.

776
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,520
Oh!

777
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Touche.

778
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:10,280
What they need to do is seriously, Tecmo needs to partner with Girls Gone Wild in his fucking

779
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:19,320
DOA Xtreme 3, or Girls Gone Wild- Who's that guy who makes Dead or Alive, Itagaki?

780
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,360
Oh my god, he needs to do something like, how much do I have to pay him, though, to

781
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,160
put in a little gay content?

782
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,000
Not lesbians, sorry Chris, but like, you know, a hardcore, like, guy-on-guy action.

783
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Did you say sorry to me?

784
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
No, I said Chris.

785
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,640
Because it's probably Shane, like- No, not Shane, I'm sorry you're here.

786
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,040
I'm sorry you're here.

787
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
Alright.

788
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,760
I love one-sided conversations on the radio.

789
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
So professional.

790
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,880
Anyhow, shall we move on?

791
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,920
Why not?

792
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:53,280
You know what, I have better things to do, no I'm kidding.

793
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:02,980
For everybody who was into Amplitude, who played Amplitude Online, Sony is giving the

794
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,360
online server the boot right at the ass.

795
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:12,240
The Amplitude online server is going away.

796
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,160
It will be, I believe actually was down now.

797
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,680
It went off on Sunday, right?

798
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,920
I think today was the last hurrah.

799
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,960
7pm Eastern Time, so it's gone already.

800
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,080
Aw, that's sad, kinda.

801
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,280
That's so sad that a game that's a few years old loses its online content.

802
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,520
Buy a new game!

803
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,280
How about they make one as good as Amplitude?

804
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,420
That would be awesome.

805
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,360
Give me Guitar Hero Online.

806
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360
You jerk.

807
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,720
I don't care if Marissa hates Guitar Hero, I'd play it.

808
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,680
I liked Amplitude and I did play it online.

809
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,120
Of course, not two years.

810
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,320
Lately I have, Chris.

811
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,760
Okay, this is not the Let's Cry About Rob Not Getting Laid show.

812
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,080
Hey, guess what?

813
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
What?

814
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:07,120
If you thought that Gran Turismo HD was an awesome preview of what Gran Turismo 5 may

815
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,560
be someday, whenever the fuck it comes out, well guess what?

816
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:17,920
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is coming out later this year and it's supposed to be yet another

817
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,720
fucking demo of what Gran Turismo 5 is gonna be.

818
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,720
Hurrah.

819
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,560
And actually, they were saying that if, I think the original Gran Turismo 4 Prologue,

820
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,600
you actually have to buy that.

821
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,540
So I don't know, great, another fucking demo of Gran Turismo.

822
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,540
Guess what?

823
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,540
The first one sucked.

824
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,540
I didn't like it.

825
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,400
And the second one, probably not gonna download it.

826
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,520
Gran Turismo 5, probably not gonna buy it.

827
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:49,120
So hooray.

828
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,260
James Patrick in chat, commenting on the MMO thing, says a Mass Effect will probably have

829
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,260
gay romance.

830
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,800
Is Skye looking forward to that?

831
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,200
No, because as I said earlier, I always play chicks and MMOs because everybody's nicer

832
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,800
to you when you're a chick in an MMO and I don't wanna do a lesbian thing.

833
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,800
That's gross.

834
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
Yeah, World of Warcraft people.

835
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,520
Yeah, first of all, fuck you.

836
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,520
Second of all- Right now?

837
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,680
Yeah, right now, Rob.

838
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,720
Punch fans back on.

839
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,880
There's our random ahh from Exeter.

840
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,520
Don't tell anyone that you're a lesbian on WoW, or that you have a character, because

841
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,260
I swear to God, they will not shut up.

842
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,160
All the guys around you will go, ooh, lesbians, cool.

843
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,720
And everybody else will go, that's against God.

844
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,840
Noobs.

845
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,080
I just think that's a part of the history of the internets, because my father, when

846
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:50,440
we had prodigy internet, went with his guy friend, who was a teacher, went into a lesbian

847
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,560
chat room and went, hi, lesies, and were immediately booted because everybody knew they were straight.

848
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,440
It's just something about the internet that makes people retarded with that stuff.

849
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,960
My father, for God's sake.

850
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,400
I almost wanna make a gay.com account right now, impersonating us a woman.

851
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,960
I'll put Chris' picture as my profile or something, and go into a chat room and put, hey, lesies.

852
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,840
See what happens.

853
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:24,560
We were gonna do that for my ex-boyfriend, who is so totally gay, as an April Fools joke,

854
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,520
put his profile and his address.

855
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
That's so wrong.

856
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,520
That's so wrong.

857
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,840
Oh, and one of the gay dating sites.

858
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,160
He needs help admitting his gayness.

859
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,360
Yeah, he needs, he's just, yeah, okay.

860
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
This show is very gay.

861
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,320
The first step is admitting you're gay.

862
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,320
Well we already did that.

863
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,280
We would like to take your live calls right now on our Skype line.

864
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,200
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, straight, gay, pre-op, who cares?

865
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,200
We don't care.

866
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,760
Come be gay with us.

867
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,760
Yeah.

868
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,560
Come talk to us about whatever topic you want.

869
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,880
Maybe there's a topic we've already talked about on the show that you wanna elaborate

870
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,880
on.

871
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,160
Maybe there's something new we haven't talked about yet that you'd like to share with us.

872
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,080
It's all in your court right now.

873
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,760
Also, 1-877-GAME-OLR is only local in the United States and Canada, meaning that's where

874
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,880
it's only toll free.

875
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,040
If you are abroad in another country, we encourage you to download Skype and call us on our username,

876
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,480
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

877
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,520
They're all gonna call in for Maritha.

878
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,760
We'll see what happens.

879
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,920
Let's go to the first call, boys and girls.

880
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

881
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,920
Who's this?

882
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,520
Did I not actually pick up a call?

883
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,520
My bad.

884
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

885
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Who's this?

886
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
It's Dark Tetsuya.

887
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
Hi, Dark Tetsuya.

888
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,520
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

889
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
I don't know, not much.

890
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
I'm just calling in to say hi.

891
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,600
You just wanted to say hi to Maritha?

892
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,600
Is that it?

893
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,600
No.

894
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Yeah.

895
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,600
Oh, thank God.

896
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,600
What are you wearing?

897
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,600
Well, no.

898
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,600
I so want groupies.

899
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Why do only men get groupies?

900
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,600
I want groupies.

901
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Are you kidding?

902
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
This woman has so many groupies.

903
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
That's because she's hot.

904
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
Are you a Dark Sakura groupie, DT?

905
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
Say no.

906
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,600
My husband won't let you down.

907
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,600
Kind of.

908
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
He says kind of.

909
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:06,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, not at all.

910
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,520
Dan will step on you.

911
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,600
He's a groupie that respects boundaries.

912
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Yeah.

913
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
That's fair.

914
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
I prefer fanboys.

915
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,600
All right.

916
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,600
Well, what kind of games you been playing this week, Dark Tetsuya?

917
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,640
Just step on the lead.

918
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,640
I'm trying.

919
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,280
There must have been something that compelled you to pick up the phone and call in.

920
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,160
Was there a story tonight that particularly touched a nerve with you?

921
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,640
Well, the AOU stuff.

922
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,640
Ah, the arcade stuff we talked about in part A, like the Silent Hill game and DDR Super

923
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,640
Nova.

924
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,640
What do you think of all that?

925
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,640
Sounds pretty cool.

926
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,800
I'm hooked about Super Nova 2.

927
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,800
Yeah.

928
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:45,280
Did you think Super Nova was a real, like, was it, did it kind of rescue the DDR series

929
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,800
or?

930
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,800
I think so.

931
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,120
Very cool.

932
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,760
What features would you like to see new in Super Nova 2?

933
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,640
I mean, just new songs, or what would you like to see Konami do with Super Nova 2?

934
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:01,120
Well, affecting the new songs, they should probably put in the link mode.

935
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,000
Ah, link mode.

936
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,280
Ah, so like you can use your memory card from the home version on the arcade.

937
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,280
That's a good idea.

938
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,000
Hopefully it'll happen.

939
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Do you like to track your data?

940
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Yeah.

941
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,840
Act Deft, who changed his name to Act Deft Marissa Fan in chat, says, remember to put

942
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,840
in link mode.

943
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,840
Very cool.

944
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,840
Very cool.

945
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,720
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dr. Tzuyu?

946
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,400
I just thought that Silent Hill game was cool.

947
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,400
Yeah, it does.

948
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,360
What, what, what, do you think Silent Hill's going to work as a first person shooter?

949
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,360
It might.

950
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,640
I guess we'll see when we play the game, huh?

951
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,640
Yeah.

952
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,240
Do you think the graphics look okay?

953
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,160
I mean, Dark Chakra was kind of knocking the graphics earlier, saying that, you know, PlayStation

954
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,160
2 had better graphics.

955
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,160
What do you think?

956
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,160
Right.

957
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,200
No, no, they look pretty good.

958
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,200
Kind of atmospheric.

959
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,200
Atmospheric.

960
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,200
Yeah.

961
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,200
All right.

962
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,200
Well, Dr. Tzuyu, thanks so much for your call.

963
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,360
We've got to take some other calls, though, but have a good one, okay, buddy?

964
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,360
I will.

965
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,360
Yeah.

966
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,360
All right.

967
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,360
Later.

968
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,040
We welcome your calls right now at 916 anymore.

969
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,800
And I almost gave my home phone number, 877-GAME-OLR.

970
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,200
It's 877-GAME-OLR.

971
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,200
Let's go to another call.

972
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,200
Hi.

973
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,200
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

974
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,200
Who's this?

975
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,200
Hey, it's Seisha.

976
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,200
Hi.

977
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,200
I just told you to call.

978
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,200
What's on your mind?

979
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,200
Wow, that was fast.

980
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
What's on your mind, Seisha?

981
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,200
No.

982
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,800
I think Silent Hill's going to suck as a first-person shooter.

983
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Why do you think it's going to suck as a first-person shooter?

984
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,800
I don't know.

985
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,760
It's just not going to be, like, atmospheric enough, I don't think.

986
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,960
Do you think it's going to fall into the same pattern that the Resident Evil gun survivor

987
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
games did?

988
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,960
Yes.

989
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,960
Definitely.

990
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,880
You know, I actually liked the second one.

991
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:53,120
I got to play the Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, and I thought it was pretty cool, but I'm

992
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,880
really trying to reserve my judgment for actually playing it.

993
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,800
I just love Silent Hill.

994
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,440
Mmm, but nah.

995
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,000
I like the atmosphere and the whole ambience about it.

996
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,880
I don't think it'll work.

997
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,440
What do you think would make it cool?

998
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,480
Apart from Pyramid Head.

999
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,680
But it has nurses.

1000
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,680
I don't know.

1001
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,960
I'm just not a really big fan of first-person shooters, I guess.

1002
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,240
So if you were going to design a Silent Hill arcade game, how would you make it?

1003
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,560
I probably wouldn't make one, to be honest.

1004
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,200
Fair enough.

1005
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:40,080
All right, well, I think you have a fan here in studio who wanted to say hello to you,

1006
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,120
Asatia, since you called in.

1007
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,520
Hi, hot, sexy British guy.

1008
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,960
That's Rice Princess, by the way.

1009
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,960
Hey, Rice Princess.

1010
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,960
How's it going?

1011
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
I'm really tired, actually.

1012
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,960
It's 5 a.m.

1013
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,960
Oh, my God.

1014
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,960
Aw, and he stayed up to listen to us.

1015
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,960
I know, wasn't I?

1016
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,960
No, to listen to us, Rice Princess, not you.

1017
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,960
Okay, I'm going to go and not cry in a corner.

1018
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,960
Not true.

1019
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,960
He did ask about her earlier.

1020
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Aw, that's so sweet.

1021
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,960
And he's all sexy.

1022
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
You guys should add each other on there.

1023
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:13,360
Oh, my God, we totally should.

1024
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,840
Do you use MySpace, Asatia?

1025
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,400
Yeah, I do.

1026
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,120
Oh, type it to Skye in the chat room.

1027
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,120
He's on my friends list.

1028
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,120
Oh, is he?

1029
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,120
Mm-hmm.

1030
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,120
Really?

1031
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,120
Yeah.

1032
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
Well, no.

1033
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,120
Hey.

1034
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,120
All right.

1035
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,120
Well, there you go.

1036
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,120
Who's online?

1037
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,120
Are you?

1038
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,120
No.

1039
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
Okay.

1040
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,120
All right.

1041
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,120
There you go.

1042
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,120
Sweet.

1043
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
All right.

1044
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,120
Because she loves Silent Hill and could talk all about the first-person games with you,

1045
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,120
I guess.

1046
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,120
I don't know.

1047
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,120
Yeah.

1048
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,120
All right.

1049
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,120
She might convince me.

1050
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
All right.

1051
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,120
Oh, there you go.

1052
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,120
Oh, hey.

1053
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,120
All right.

1054
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,120
So I've got a bet going now.

1055
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,120
Why?

1056
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,120
What's that?

1057
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,120
I bet Irene can convince.

1058
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
Oh, man.

1059
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,120
Okay.

1060
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,120
I'll give you $50.

1061
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,120
No, I'm kidding.

1062
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,120
Which is like next to nothing in pounds, right?

1063
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,120
I know.

1064
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,120
Totally nothing at all.

1065
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,120
So I guess you're kind of losing out there.

1066
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,120
All right.

1067
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,120
Well, as much as I'd love to keep the OLR love connection going, we've got to get the

1068
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,120
show moving.

1069
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,120
Sesha, you're a good sport.

1070
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,120
Thanks for calling in and staying up so late.

1071
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,120
You're a true fan.

1072
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
We love you.

1073
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
See you, guys.

1074
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,120
All right.

1075
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,120
Take care, buddy.

1076
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,120
Bye, sexy British guy.

1077
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,120
Have you ever even seen a picture?

1078
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,120
No, I don't care.

1079
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,120
He sounds hot.

1080
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,120
He's cute.

1081
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,120
That's very not superficial of you.

1082
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,120
That's very nice.

1083
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,120
I know.

1084
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,120
Yeah.

1085
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,120
He sounds really hot, dude.

1086
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,120
I saw his picture.

1087
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,120
He's cute.

1088
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,120
Is he?

1089
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,120
Note to all guys.

1090
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,120
I think he's cute.

1091
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,120
Get fake British accents.

1092
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:45,120
Well, next week on Orange Ounce Radio, we're going to be talking about Rod puppets.

1093
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,120
Instant softie there.

1094
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
Hello.

1095
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,120
Is that what I'm doing wrong?

1096
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,120
Is that why I can't get laid?

1097
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,120
I love the way you say that.

1098
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,120
Laid.

1099
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,120
Is that why I haven't had a date in so long?

1100
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,120
Your accent is terrible.

1101
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,120
That was mine.

1102
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,120
Why am I even trying?

1103
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,120
Well, let's go to another call, shall we?

1104
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,120
Better, Rob.

1105
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,120
Hello, you're Auntie with Orange Ounce Radio.

1106
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,120
Who's this?

1107
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,120
Oh, God.

1108
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,120
That voice turned me on.

1109
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,120
Hi, DMN.

1110
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,120
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you.

1111
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,120
Hi, DMN.

1112
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,120
Right now.

1113
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,120
Hi, everybody.

1114
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
Hi.

1115
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,120
You have to come to my birthday party, you bastard.

1116
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
I'll try.

1117
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,120
Okay.

1118
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:34,120
Something about Crackdown I actually wanted to talk about.

1119
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,120
I don't know if any of you guys heard, but a Halo 3 demo came with Crackdown.

1120
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,120
Careful, don't call it a demo.

1121
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,120
It's a beta.

1122
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,120
Bill Gates will come sodomize you if you call it a demo.

1123
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,120
It doesn't come with a demo.

1124
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,120
It will be available for download later.

1125
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:58,120
But here's the thing I don't get is that rabid Halo fanboys who wank off to Master Chief

1126
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:04,120
are basically saying, oh, my God, I have to pay $60 to play the beta.

1127
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,120
It's a beta.

1128
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,120
No, you don't.

1129
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,120
You could have done all those other things like registered and be drawn randomly or play

1130
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:16,120
Halo 2 for some amount of time and be the first 13,333 people.

1131
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:20,120
Or you could unbunch your wedgie and just wait for the real game to come out.

1132
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,120
And that's what I'm saying.

1133
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,120
It's a beta test.

1134
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,120
It's one of the first console games I've ever known of that's having a public beta test.

1135
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:33,120
It's like I was saying earlier in the show, even though 11 billion people are in the Halo

1136
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,120
3 beta, and I'm very sorry to Mike W. who was complaining earlier about being a Halo

1137
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,120
fan and being like the only person not in the beta.

1138
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,120
I'm not in the beta either, but I don't care.

1139
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,120
For some reason, people want to be in this beta because it makes their Internet penis

1140
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,120
bigger, because it's like I was in the Halo 3 beta.

1141
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,120
I'm doing half the Internet.

1142
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,120
It's pretty ridiculous.

1143
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,120
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, DMN?

1144
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,120
STFU, we're looking for a guest.

1145
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,120
Anybody who's listening live would like to be a guest.

1146
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,120
We're taping Tuesday night, so shoot me an eye.

1147
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Why don't you have Rice Prince as a guest?

1148
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,120
Oh, Dark Soccer.

1149
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,120
I want to, but I'm actually, and I was going to say something about that.

1150
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,120
I forgot that my class that I thought was Friday is actually on Tuesday.

1151
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,120
I'm actually taking chakra mapping, metaphysical shit.

1152
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,120
This is my massage therapy school.

1153
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,120
Interesting.

1154
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,120
Do you want me to manipulate your energy, DMN?

1155
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,120
I don't have any energy today.

1156
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,120
Why don't you have Marissa on?

1157
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,120
She's welcome to come on if she wants.

1158
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,120
Wee!

1159
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:39,120
I say you get a bunch of girls on your show this week.

1160
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
Oh, no.

1161
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,120
And see how you like it when you have more girls than guys on the show.

1162
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,120
Aww, estrogen fest!

1163
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,120
I see what you did there.

1164
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,120
You kind of put your own show name in there.

1165
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,120
All right.

1166
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Tune in to SDFU on Thursday nights right here on Orange,

1167
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,120
Ontario at 7 o'clock Pacific.

1168
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,120
It's a good time.

1169
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,120
Usually.

1170
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,120
Have a good one, DMN.

1171
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Bye.

1172
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,120
Bye.

1173
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,120
Wait, do we have a picture?

1174
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,120
Wait, is this a picture?

1175
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,120
Yeah.

1176
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,120
All right.

1177
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,120
I want to see the British guy.

1178
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,120
I know, we all want to see.

1179
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,120
Rice Princess ran over.

1180
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,120
Let's see, let's see.

1181
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,120
Aww.

1182
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,120
The British guy's hot.

1183
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,120
He's kind of young.

1184
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,120
Oh, yeah, but he's still hot.

1185
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,120
The British guy is hot.

1186
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,120
You're going to scare the poor guy off.

1187
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,120
Dude, you're a pimp, man.

1188
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,120
We all think you're hot.

1189
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,120
He's never going to come to chat again.

1190
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,120
Look at his other pictures real quick.

1191
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,120
All right.

1192
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,120
Even Shane like randomly appeared under nowhere.

1193
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,120
I heard something about a British guy.

1194
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,120
Dude, he's got, okay, that's awesome.

1195
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,120
He's got very nice eyes.

1196
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,120
All right.

1197
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,120
Anyway, can we go to another call?

1198
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,120
May we please go to another call?

1199
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,120
All right.

1200
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,120
Let's go to another call.

1201
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,120
Hi, you're on Orange, Ontario.

1202
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,120
Who's this?

1203
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,120
Hi, Ronma.

1204
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,120
It's not Ronma.

1205
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,120
Is this Ronma?

1206
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,120
Who is it?

1207
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,120
It's Exoverr calling from the living room.

1208
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,120
Shut up, Exoverr.

1209
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,120
It's Exoverr calling from the living room.

1210
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,120
I'm so not Ronma.

1211
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,120
That's so funny.

1212
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,120
Did I sound black?

1213
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,120
No, I'm totally white.

1214
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,120
Okay.

1215
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:10,120
The few times that I've been on this show and Ronma has called in, he's like scratchy

1216
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,120
like he's calling from his cell phone because his, what's it called?

1217
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,120
Get off the fucking phone.

1218
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,120
Oh, that makes sense.

1219
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,120
Anyway, bye.

1220
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,120
Fucker.

1221
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:27,120
No cookie.

1222
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,120
I hate this show.

1223
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:35,120
By the way, Marissa, Act of Death is now Act of Death Marissa fans.

1224
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,120
We got to go to another call.

1225
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,120
Hi, you're on Orange, Ontario.

1226
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,120
Who's this?

1227
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,120
Static.

1228
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,120
Hello?

1229
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,120
Can you hear us?

1230
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,120
Okay.

1231
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:50,120
Unfortunately, that caller did not go through and it was a new caller and I feel bad that

1232
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,120
I had to hang up.

1233
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,120
No, you don't.

1234
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:57,120
Well, you know, I just, you know, I appreciate new people taking the effort to call in, but

1235
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,120
unfortunately we couldn't hear you.

1236
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,120
Maybe there was lag or something.

1237
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,120
Act of Death says heart, Marissa.

1238
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,120
Heart, you too.

1239
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,120
Here's also a PSA for any new caller from the show.

1240
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,120
It was Yumi.

1241
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,120
I know and that's why I felt bad.

1242
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,120
Yumi, make your microphone work.

1243
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,120
It's not what I want to hear from you.

1244
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,120
Use the power of evil.

1245
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,120
That's all right.

1246
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,120
We'll go to another call in the meantime.

1247
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,120
Hi, you're on Orange, Ontario.

1248
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,120
Who's this?

1249
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:20,120
This is a long time listener, Dark Knight, rising from the dead.

1250
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,120
Hi, Dark Knight.

1251
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,120
Hi, it's DK.

1252
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,120
It's been a long time since we heard from you, buddy.

1253
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,120
What's on your mind?

1254
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,120
Uh, nothing much.

1255
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,120
I thought I might give...

1256
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,120
Oh, hold on.

1257
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,120
I know.

1258
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,120
The feedback is horrible, isn't it?

1259
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,120
He's my Southern buddy.

1260
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,120
Okay, I'm good.

1261
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:43,120
I just want to give a little mini review on Diddy Kong, because I saw it in the chat room earlier about it.

1262
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,120
Please do, I haven't played this game yet. I'm curious if I should pick it up.

1263
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:52,120
It's okay, but like they said, it's more like a rehash of the N64 version.

1264
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,120
Really?

1265
01:00:54,120 --> 01:01:02,120
It seems like a rehash of the N64 version. The only difference is that some of the mini games will incorporate the use of the stylus.

1266
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:10,120
Sort of like how Mario on the DS, the launch title, was kind of Mario 64 with some extra frills.

1267
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:15,120
Exactly. Like I said, it was more of a rehash, if anything else.

1268
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:20,120
Like when you're doing your turbo boost, you know how in the N64 one you usually hit the buttons.

1269
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:27,120
To do the turbo boost on this one, you actually have to use the stylus to boost your level up to do the boost.

1270
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,120
Well, would you recommend the game to others?

1271
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,120
Yes, no.

1272
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:36,120
What was it? Yes, no? Yeah, you know?

1273
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,120
Yeah, you know.

1274
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:49,120
I mean, yes to some, they're hard fans, but if you've never played Diddy Kong before or something like that, you might want to pass.

1275
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:55,120
So people that are expecting to play Mario Kart DS Part 2, they're going to be disappointed, you think?

1276
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,120
Just about if anything else.

1277
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:03,120
All right, well, so noted. Anything else you want to comment on on tonight's show?

1278
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:08,120
Like I said, it's been a long time calling the show. I've missed talking to you guys at times.

1279
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:13,120
Well, we miss having you call in, so feel free to call us anytime. You know where to find us.

1280
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:22,120
Yeah, usually though, I'm calling on Travis' show, and he can tell you that I have been in good appearance on that show lately.

1281
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:28,120
Travis has a great show, and all the callers just enhance to that show, no matter how good or bad they are, so it's a good time.

1282
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,120
Especially since he has a NASCAR partner, so yeah.

1283
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,120
That's Saturday nights on Orange Laundrio, by the way. Check it out, Travis Donovan.

1284
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,120
All right, Dark Knight, have a good one, and thanks so much for your call.

1285
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,120
No problem. You have a good night.

1286
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,120
You too.

1287
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,120
Later, guys.

1288
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,120
Bye.

1289
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,120
Bye.

1290
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,120
Bye.

1291
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,120
I like hearing from Dark Knight. I like hearing from all our callers.

1292
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:53,120
And if you're wondering, and you're sitting at home and asking yourself, why do the same people call in every week?

1293
01:02:53,120 --> 01:03:02,120
Because they can. Orange Laundrio is an open forum, and if you are sick and tired of hearing the same people every week on this show, as awesome as they are, you need to start calling in too.

1294
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:08,120
And you can do that by listening to us Sunday nights live at 6 o'clock Pacific time, or you can leave us a voicemail at any time during the week.

1295
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:15,120
We haven't had a lot of them lately, so we haven't had anything to play, but 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number if you ever want to leave a voicemail.

1296
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,120
Here on Orange Laundrio, who's this?

1297
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,120
Hey there. This is Let's Have Tea.

1298
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,120
Hi. What's Up G? Is that it?

1299
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,120
Let's Have Tea.

1300
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,120
Let's Have Tea. I thought he said, What's Up G?

1301
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,120
Word, yo!

1302
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:34,120
Did I fuck up that name? My bad. I actually had a little tea earlier.

1303
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,120
What's on your mind, Let's Have Tea?

1304
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:44,120
I was actually wondering what your thoughts was on the XNA.

1305
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:50,120
On XNA, the amateur development studio for Xbox. Anybody have a thought on this?

1306
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,120
Right.

1307
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,120
I talk too much on the show, so I'm deferring.

1308
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,120
I have a thought that I really haven't cared too much about it.

1309
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,120
But you're not really into the programming stuff. You just want to play the game, right?

1310
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:06,120
Oh no, I like seeing the behind the scenes stuff. It's just I'm like, I guess maybe I'm too saturated right now.

1311
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,120
Yeah, and maybe it's like for you-

1312
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:12,120
But I go looking for behind the scenes stuff all the time. I just got done watching the behind the scenes of Silent Hill 3.

1313
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,120
I think I would love to see XNA allowed.

1314
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:21,120
I suppose I could pay the $99 and play some of the games that are going to come out from XNA.

1315
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:27,120
But I would like to see something a little more easily accessible where I could play some of the products that XNA creates.

1316
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:32,120
Because there's going to be a lot of independent games out there, and I really hope they start to see the light of day.

1317
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:36,120
I know it's not going to happen right away, but maybe a little later on in the year and on into 2008,

1318
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,120
we'll get to start to see some of the products.

1319
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:42,120
I know a lick about video game programming. XNA does nothing for me.

1320
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,120
But I'm excited at the prospect of it's going to make original games.

1321
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:51,120
Because there's going to be independent developers, one man, two man, three man teams out there making their own games.

1322
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:57,120
I want to see some of those on Xbox Live and see what original content is out there.

1323
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:02,120
I mean, look at some of the games that have been developed for the web that are starting to get big now.

1324
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,120
You have Flow, Line Rider, those types of things.

1325
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:09,120
I think XNA could produce more stuff like that.

1326
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,120
Oh yeah, definitely.

1327
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,120
Are you an XNA user, Let's Have Team?

1328
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,120
I'm on a few teams for 3D modeling and such.

1329
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,120
That's hard stuff.

1330
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,120
Excuse me?

1331
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,120
I said that's hard stuff.

1332
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:34,120
The 3D modeling is hard stuff.

1333
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:38,120
That's alright. We're probably having a little bit of lag.

1334
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,120
That happens because our internet is getting hammered here.

1335
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:46,120
I guess I'll ask you one last question and hopefully you can make this out.

1336
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,120
What would be your response to this question?

1337
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,120
What do you hope XNA can accomplish in the next six months or a year?

1338
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:01,120
I'm really looking forward to seeing more original content.

1339
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:08,120
Because most game developers now are too afraid of making something new rather than just continuing with sequels and such.

1340
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:20,120
So XNA will be able to have independent developers and small online teams be able to make something new and original.

1341
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:24,120
Alright, well good luck. It sounds like you're doing some of that XNA stuff yourself.

1342
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:28,120
So good luck to the things that you're modeling and all that.

1343
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,120
Let us know if you work on any games that show up.

1344
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:39,120
I think that's a good idea because it seems like, to be vulgar as I usually am,

1345
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:44,120
that games are just turning into long series of porns with the same name.

1346
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,120
You know, The Pressed Men 10.

1347
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,120
Some original games would be nice.

1348
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:55,120
Again, I'm not well versed in the PSP at all, but I actually gave it to my ex-boyfriend being very stupid and very broken.

1349
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:59,120
I forgot to get him a game as well, but he didn't care because he was excited about everything that was homebrew.

1350
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:06,120
I have to say, that is some amazing insight from a casual gamer that games are starting to sound like porn titles.

1351
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,120
Because you're kind of right, and I've never thought about it that way before, but it's kind of true.

1352
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,120
Cooking mama.

1353
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,120
Let's poke mama's steak.

1354
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,120
Alright, let's have tea.

1355
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,120
Thanks so much for the call, okay buddy?

1356
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,120
Of course.

1357
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,120
Have a good one.

1358
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,120
I can't believe I called him What's Up G.

1359
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,120
That's what it sounded like. Am I the one that heard that?

1360
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,120
I'm not the one that heard that.

1361
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,120
I don't know.

1362
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,120
I'm going to try another call here.

1363
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:43,120
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1364
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,120
Can you hear me? This is Uni.

1365
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,120
Yes, it's a little lagged, but I can kind of hear you. What's on your mind, Uni?

1366
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,120
Oh, I was going to ask, how many people play Harvest Moon?

1367
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,120
Me.

1368
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,120
I played it once.

1369
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,120
Who else in here? Anybody else play Harvest Moon?

1370
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,120
Lesbians love sheep.

1371
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,120
Anybody?

1372
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,120
I don't know what that means, but I don't even want to know.

1373
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,120
I like my plushie from Harvest Moon.

1374
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,120
But you don't really play the games?

1375
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,120
Not really.

1376
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,120
Loki? No, he says no.

1377
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,120
I used to just watch people play it, and I thought it was amusing.

1378
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,120
You got one. Are you a Harvest Moon player?

1379
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:26,120
Yes, I am. My sister and mom got me Harvest Moon, More Friends of Mineral Town for Christmas.

1380
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:32,120
Seriously, that game is like crack.

1381
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:40,120
My sister and I would play it just to say, who's going to marry who or something.

1382
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,120
That's the priorities.

1383
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:47,120
Try to sell me on this game for a minute, because I'm not a huge Harvest Moon person.

1384
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,120
Why should I play Harvest Moon?

1385
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:58,120
The first one I played, you are trying to save this town called Mineral Town.

1386
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:07,120
Basically, you take three years to sell as many crops as you can, bring as much reputation to the town, which is Mineral Town.

1387
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,120
Wait, I've got to play this game for three years?

1388
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:19,120
No, the days last for about ten minutes, to be totally honest.

1389
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:31,120
It's kind of like that with More Friends of Mineral Town, which you're basically playing as a female instead of a male.

1390
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:36,120
You can actually marry somebody on that game.

1391
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:42,120
You can actually marry men when you're on the women's version, and you can marry a woman on the men's version.

1392
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,120
It's lame.

1393
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:48,120
No gay marriage. Can you partner? Can you get a civil union?

1394
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,120
No, I'm sorry.

1395
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,120
We're used to it.

1396
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:58,120
One more question for you, even though you're the one that called us.

1397
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:03,120
What makes this game different from Animal Crossing?

1398
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:19,120
Well, you don't have to go take the pink dresser from Cat Person's house to the dog person and then take a letter to the owl person.

1399
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,120
You just grow shit and sell it, and then you feed your dog.

1400
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:28,120
I don't remember getting the sheep in Harvest Moon to say, you cunt.

1401
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:33,120
Am I right?

1402
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,120
But you do have to comb your horse.

1403
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,120
Yes, you do.

1404
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,120
You have to comb it all the time, like every cow.

1405
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,120
Do you get to tip the cows, though?

1406
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,120
I don't think you can.

1407
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,120
Do you tip your cows?

1408
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,120
No.

1409
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,120
I don't think they give you that option.

1410
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,120
I know your name is really simple, but I love it.

1411
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:56,120
I just saw a thing with a unicorn today, and I geeked out because I'm a girl.

1412
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,120
If I remember right, isn't it based off of Yuna from Final Fantasy X?

1413
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:07,120
Yes, that was my DDR nickname back when I was playing in Rhode Island.

1414
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,120
At least your teacher didn't name you.

1415
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:18,120
A lot of girls that are into games seem to really enjoy Yuna from Final Fantasy X.

1416
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,120
She's like a role model for girls.

1417
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,120
Her boobs aren't big enough.

1418
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,120
I'm actually a lot like her in real life.

1419
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,120
You mean she's normal?

1420
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,120
Yeah, I know. Weird, huh?

1421
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,120
Not that there's anything wrong with the big boobies.

1422
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,120
There's nothing wrong with the big boobies at all.

1423
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,120
Yeah, anyways, I should let you guys go.

1424
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,120
Yeah, thanks.

1425
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,120
Thank you for the advice.

1426
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,120
We love you, Yuni.

1427
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,120
All right, take care, Yuni.

1428
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,120
Thanks for the call.

1429
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,120
We appreciate it.

1430
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,120
Bye.

1431
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,120
Bye.

1432
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
All right.

1433
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,120
I am so pathetic.

1434
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,120
We'll probably do one more call here on the show.

1435
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:53,120
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR,

1436
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:59,120
or you can always call us on the old-fashioned Skype line or whatever you want to do.

1437
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,120
What was Yuna from?

1438
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,120
Final Fantasy X.

1439
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,120
I've not played that game.

1440
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,120
You should. It's a good game.

1441
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,120
Well, I haven't been able to pick it up, so that's why.

1442
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,120
It's like I saw a unicorn today.

1443
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,120
I was like, unicorns, and I saw her name.

1444
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,120
A unicorn?

1445
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,120
That is so fucking pathetic.

1446
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,120
Wow, you're interesting.

1447
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,120
Oh, my God.

1448
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,120
But I love you.

1449
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,120
All right, let's do at least one more call here.

1450
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,120
Hi, you're on Orange On The Radio.

1451
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,120
Who's this?

1452
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,120
It's Raven's Coffin.

1453
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,120
Hi, Raven's Coffin.

1454
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,120
What's on your mind, buddy?

1455
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,120
I am the saddest attorney in the world.

1456
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,120
I object to that.

1457
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,120
Objection.

1458
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,120
Overruled, motherfucker.

1459
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,120
I am a legal secretary.

1460
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,120
Well, thank you.

1461
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,120
Oh.

1462
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,120
All right, what is legally on your mind, dude?

1463
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,120
Well, legally, I did get my hands on Phoenix Wright, Justice For All.

1464
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,120
What'd you think?

1465
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,120
I love it.

1466
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:53,120
It is kind of like a continuation of the game, but hey, it's Phoenix Wright, and you also

1467
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,120
pick it up.

1468
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,120
It's great.

1469
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,120
Tell me what I'm in for if I've never played Phoenix Wright before.

1470
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,120
What can I expect from Phoenix Wright, either the first or second one?

1471
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:06,120
All right, this one, Phoenix Wright's a text game, so you have to click a lot and read

1472
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:11,120
a lot, and you have to find clues and contradictions in the game.

1473
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:15,120
And if you don't find things, things get a little hairy.

1474
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:20,120
If you mess up and show Judge the wrong kind of evidence, you will go, uh-uh, not true,

1475
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:27,120
and he will go bang, and you'll look stupid.

1476
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,720
What do you think draws, because this is a very cult type of game.

1477
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,120
Why do you think so many people are drawn to this as like a cult game?

1478
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:40,120
Because the story is so insane, and it's like law and order.

1479
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:46,120
If you've never played something like this, the story is so driven, it's a very story-driven

1480
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:51,120
game, and you want to see how the story is progressing, and you know, like the Edgeworth

1481
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,120
trial, I'm not going to give away anything.

1482
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,120
All I'm saying is holy shit, holy shit.

1483
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:59,120
So it's got a good story like Law and Order, like an episode of Law and Order.

1484
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,120
What about the girl with the whip?

1485
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,120
Yeah.

1486
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,120
What about the girl with the whip?

1487
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,120
Oh my God.

1488
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,120
Doesn't she make you miss things?

1489
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,120
I like that girl.

1490
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,120
I saw art stuff of her, and she was fucking hot.

1491
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,120
Was that on like DeviantArt?

1492
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,120
No.

1493
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,120
Oh.

1494
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,120
No, you do not go there for concept art.

1495
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,120
You go there for porn, Rob.

1496
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,120
Oh, what's the difference between a lawyer and a catfish?

1497
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,120
What?

1498
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,120
One's a scum-sucking bottom-feeder, and the other's a fish.

1499
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,120
Very nice, very nice.

1500
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,120
One quick thing, Rob.

1501
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,120
Yeah, what else?

1502
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:38,120
All games are interactive, so I love to them.

1503
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,120
I was defending the Wii, and, well, I failed.

1504
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,120
How did you fail?

1505
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,120
I haven't heard this.

1506
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,120
I love all games, but they almost produce too much show that I can't stay on top of

1507
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:51,120
it a lot, so you have to kind of tell me.

1508
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,120
What were they saying real quick?

1509
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,120
All right.

1510
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:59,120
It was a courtroom battle against the PlayStation 3, the Wii, and the Xbox 360.

1511
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:04,120
Of course, the 360 is fun because you've got a bunch of hardcore gamers in there.

1512
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,120
I love everyone.

1513
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,120
They're saying that, you know, if you put up a bunch of hardcore gamers, they're going

1514
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:15,120
to pay for 360 because it's the best, and that's all I have to say.

1515
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:21,120
I defend the Wii, and they ask me why does the graphics suck, and I go, they don't suck.

1516
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,120
It's because it's based off of GameCube architecture.

1517
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:29,120
Then I defended and said the GameCube architecture is actually pretty strong.

1518
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,120
Just look at Resident Evil 4.

1519
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,120
I know.

1520
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:35,120
It's not like the graphics are bad.

1521
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:40,120
It's gameplay versus graphics, and that's not to say that the Xbox has crappy gameplay.

1522
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,120
It's just that the Wii does something a little different.

1523
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,120
They're different.

1524
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,120
It's so hard to compare the two, but I don't know.

1525
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,120
That's just my thought because I love them both.

1526
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,120
I'm totally a Wii 60 person.

1527
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,120
I totally am.

1528
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,120
That's me.

1529
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,120
I'm not sold on Sony.

1530
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,120
I'm not sold on Sony yet.

1531
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,120
At least this generation.

1532
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,120
Last generation, I was told.

1533
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,120
Okay.

1534
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,120
All right.

1535
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,120
Okay.

1536
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,120
That's it.

1537
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,120
Yeah.

1538
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,120
We better go.

1539
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,120
Take care of Raven's Dolphin, though.

1540
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,120
Have a nice one, and we appreciate you calling.

1541
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,120
Okay.

1542
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,120
You too.

1543
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,120
Bye.

1544
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,120
Bye-bye.

1545
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,120
Well, I know a lot of people have been trying to get through tonight, and I apologize.

1546
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:19,120
We're not going to be able to take everyone's calls.

1547
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,120
We've run a little long in both segments, if you can't tell, so we've got to wrap it

1548
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,120
up.

1549
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,120
Any last minute stories here in studio?

1550
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Yes, actually.

1551
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,120
Okay.

1552
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,120
What's up?

1553
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:34,800
Just for anyone who is a fan of Darwinia, Plink, or DEFCON, introversion is actually

1554
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,120
stating that they're planning on putting out console games.

1555
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:43,420
They haven't really said much yet, but there is a little bit of speculation that Subversion

1556
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:47,120
might be heading that way, which is a game they're currently developing.

1557
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,120
All right.

1558
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:54,000
Anyways, there's a rumor going on saying that the next channel possibly for the Wii would

1559
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,120
be the Nintendo Power Channel.

1560
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,120
I heard about this.

1561
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,120
That's interesting.

1562
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,120
I don't know.

1563
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:06,120
I wouldn't buy Nintendo Power, so I guess this would be the only way I'd see it.

1564
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,120
Anywho...

1565
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,120
It better have Howard and Esther.

1566
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:15,600
There's also another rumor saying that a PS3 will be released to compete with the Xbox

1567
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,880
360 Core unit.

1568
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:27,400
It too will not feature a hard drive as well, and possibly lower the price down to $250.

1569
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:32,960
I guess that's kind of cool, because, I mean, you can probably find a laptop hard drive

1570
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,120
for pretty cheap, but whatever.

1571
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,020
Also, Final Furlong is coming to the Wii.

1572
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,320
For those who may not know Final Furlong, Final Furlong is a horse racing game that

1573
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,920
was in the arcade, and when you play it, it makes it look like you're fucking a horse.

1574
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,920
That game was great.

1575
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:54,360
Hence, we used to call it the horse sex game, so in this, I guess it would be...

1576
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,360
Hunt the horse.

1577
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,560
You know, it's bringing the horse sex home.

1578
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,880
So does this say the cowboy ride a horse?

1579
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:08,440
Also in another Grand Theft Auto negative story, apparently Richard O. Jones, a writer

1580
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:15,060
for Black Voice News, wrote concerns about racial stereotypes in video games.

1581
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:20,680
One such video game he's kind of mad at is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, in which Jones

1582
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:26,680
relates to the player who assumes the lead character of Carl Johnson, a down-on-his-luck

1583
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:31,100
black criminal who roams the city streets stealing cars and helping gang members knock

1584
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,400
off rivals in drive-by shootings.

1585
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:38,640
Okay, but apparently he didn't play the other games where he played other ethnicities doing

1586
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,560
the same damn thing.

1587
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,560
We all hate equally.

1588
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,560
Besides...

1589
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:50,800
Yeah, I hate nose-no-color boundaries.

1590
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,480
Everybody hates.

1591
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,960
That should be the next Wii channel.

1592
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:59,040
Not everybody votes, everybody poops, everybody hates.

1593
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,360
Just a big bitch board.

1594
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,080
What do you hate right now?

1595
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,080
I hate OLR.

1596
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,640
What do you hate more than anything at this very moment, Rob?

1597
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,640
This show.

1598
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,640
Chris?

1599
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,640
I'm just kidding.

1600
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:10,640
I love this show.

1601
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:16,320
I want to see a Wii webcam channel where you can go visit other people's webcams.

1602
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,840
The Wii Porn Channel.

1603
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,840
For people who have Wiis.

1604
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:21,840
Wii Wiis.

1605
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,840
PornTube!

1606
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:29,440
Yeah, that's what I hate more than anything right now is the fact that Pornotube upgraded

1607
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:34,520
their flash player so I can no longer use it on my Wii.

1608
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,520
Sad, huh?

1609
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,440
Anything else from anyone?

1610
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,440
I guess that's it.

1611
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:44,600
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts if we can.

1612
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,880
First off, before we wrap up the show, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning

1613
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,500
into and supporting Independent Podcast Radio.

1614
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,800
You guys are awesome and we do this show for you guys, the loyal ones who listen to us.

1615
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,560
All we ask, if you like the show, you'll notice no ads on our site.

1616
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,720
Live 365 ads, we can't control that because they pay the royalty fees so that's a small

1617
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,640
concession but it's the site itself.

1618
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,640
No ads.

1619
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,640
Podcast itself.

1620
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,440
No ads as it stands right now and no plans in the foreseeable future, although someday

1621
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,600
we may have to make money.

1622
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,360
We do this show at the fitness of our hearts.

1623
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,840
All we ask, tell one person about Orange Launch Radio.

1624
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,820
Even if it's your least favorite person in the world, tell them about Orange Launch Radio

1625
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:27,160
so that maybe they'll check it out because that's the only way we can promote because

1626
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:34,020
we don't have the marketing muscle of magazines and television channels and all that stuff.

1627
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:41,960
All we have is us and you guys, the O.L. Army, even Marisa Zech.

1628
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,720
Tell somebody about Orange Launch Radio and that's all we ask.

1629
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,480
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1630
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,480
Chris.

1631
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,480
We're already doing that.

1632
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,640
Thank you so much for being here tonight.

1633
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,640
Appreciate it.

1634
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,000
What's your final thought?

1635
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,480
My final thought is actually a plea out to all your listeners and the chatters and you

1636
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,480
guys.

1637
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,480
Please.

1638
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,480
I know.

1639
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,480
I know.

1640
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:05,200
Everyone gets tired of me talking about Megzi, but she is so stressed right now.

1641
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,360
School full time.

1642
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,360
She's going to work.

1643
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:12,240
They're cracking down on her for crap and she's dealing with Asa and dealing with that

1644
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,240
kind of stuff.

1645
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,240
She is so stressed.

1646
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:19,480
Can you guys send her some good thoughts or some comments on MySpace or something?

1647
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:22,360
You can go to Jamie's MySpace and find her.

1648
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,180
Although, to be perfectly honest, I would give anything to trade situations with her

1649
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,180
right now.

1650
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:31,720
Yeah, but at the same time, she's stressed and it's like she's not having a happy time

1651
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,720
right now.

1652
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:37,200
If she could, she'd drop everything that she's doing and come out here to be less stressed,

1653
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,200
but she's not.

1654
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,880
She's sticking through school, which was a really hard decision for her and stuff.

1655
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,980
So if people can send out some good thoughts towards her, go to her MySpace or something,

1656
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:53,160
give her a comment or something and make her happy just to ease some of it because I think

1657
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:58,120
she needs it because I love her and she needs happy.

1658
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:03,480
Gaming Nerd says, God, why don't we all trade MySpaces so we can stalk one another?

1659
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,700
Orange Lawns Radio has a MySpace and you can add us.

1660
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,320
It's MySpace.com slash Orange Lawns Radio.

1661
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,320
We're not hard to find.

1662
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,320
But if you suck, I'm not adding you.

1663
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,320
All right.

1664
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,480
Thank you and of course, you know I love Megzi.

1665
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,480
Speaking of you suck.

1666
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,520
Congratulations on your first full OLR episode.

1667
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,520
You know what?

1668
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,400
Based on your comments you've been making, you're much more of a gamer than you lead

1669
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,400
on.

1670
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,200
You follow this stuff more than you'd admit.

1671
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,720
You know more about gaming than I think you want to admit, but thanks for coming and for

1672
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,720
your insight.

1673
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,720
What's your final thought?

1674
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:34,720
Oh, yay.

1675
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,720
This is so much fun.

1676
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,720
Thank you.

1677
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,720
Thank you.

1678
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,240
Thank you so much for putting up with my ass.

1679
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:44,220
And my last... Oh, yay, hugs to Megzi.

1680
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:47,640
My final thought would be people add me on MySpace.

1681
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,640
I hate MySpace.

1682
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,640
I do.

1683
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:52,320
To be perfectly honest with those that don't like it, but it's unfortunately a necessary

1684
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,320
evil.

1685
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,320
It is.

1686
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,320
It really is.

1687
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,320
I say the same thing.

1688
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,320
It's where the internet goes to die.

1689
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,320
It's true.

1690
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,320
I don't have a 4chan.

1691
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,320
But you get accepted in that too.

1692
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:05,320
It's like cake or death, 4chan on MySpace.

1693
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,480
My final thought is yay.

1694
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,200
Thank you to everybody, especially fans.

1695
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,480
Even if you're just fans for my boobies, that's fine too.

1696
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,600
It's radio though, so it's hard.

1697
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,600
They are really big.

1698
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:25,240
If you like me or if you want to see my boobies, well, not naked, myspace.com slash M-A-R-I-S-S-A

1699
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:34,440
M-E-I-Z-E-L or if you don't like MySpace and it's MySpace bad just like sunlight, M-A-R-I-S-S-A

1700
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,120
C-O-N-G-U-S-T-O at gmail.com.

1701
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,120
Email me.

1702
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,120
Whatever.

1703
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,120
Cool.

1704
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,120
Thank you.

1705
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,120
No problem.

1706
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,240
We'll have to play some folk rock on a later episode of Orange Lounge.

1707
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,240
Oh, I get so many good friends.

1708
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,240
Give the listeners some culture.

1709
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,240
I've played James Hurley on my show before.

1710
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,240
James Hurley is awesome.

1711
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,240
He is.

1712
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,240
And James Lee Stanley is my favorite.

1713
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,040
He has the best sideburns ever.

1714
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,040
He does.

1715
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,040
He has pointy sideburns.

1716
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,040
You need to play Marissa's song on the next pop up of the volume.

1717
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,440
If Marissa would give me some.

1718
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,440
Oh, yay.

1719
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,400
And just to promote a friend, James Lee Stanley is an awesome musician who put a picture of

1720
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,400
me in a Jessica Rabbit outfit on his album.

1721
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,040
She's got that on her MySpace too.

1722
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,120
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1723
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,120
Thank you guys so much.

1724
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,120
It was a blast.

1725
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,120
No problem.

1726
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,120
Thank you for coming.

1727
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,120
Ease up on the guitar hero hate.

1728
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,120
All right.

1729
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,120
Loki, your final thought.

1730
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,480
I got to play more Crackdown.

1731
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,000
Two of the three gangs done.

1732
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,200
One last one left.

1733
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,600
The Asians are always the hardest to kill.

1734
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,640
I don't even know how to take that comment or what kind of hate mail we're going to get

1735
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,280
from that.

1736
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,400
Rice Princess, do you have a final thought?

1737
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,920
I like British guys.

1738
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:44,520
The British guy is cute, but he's kind of young for me because I'm an old lady with

1739
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,520
a crutch.

1740
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,520
I mean, a crutch.

1741
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,520
A cane.

1742
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,520
A crutch.

1743
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,520
I'm an old lady with a crutch.

1744
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:55,760
Yeah, but you're still cute and you have a great voice, so bye.

1745
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,160
So cute.

1746
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:02,160
I guess I'll go next, so we'll save the best for last, won't we, DarkSaga?

1747
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,640
As always, huh?

1748
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:09,600
My final thought is Kirby.

1749
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,040
Kirby is my final thought.

1750
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,040
DarkSaga.

1751
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:17,040
If Meg Z is listening by any chance, you fully have my sympathy because I am right now working

1752
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,840
full time, going to school 12 hours a week.

1753
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:25,440
Actually this week I'm taking two extra classes and have to do 10 documented massages by the

1754
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,440
end of the year.

1755
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:29,160
I'm sorry, by the end of March.

1756
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:33,280
And then have to take more classes and then find a way to quit my job.

1757
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,800
So I totally feel your pain.

1758
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,680
I am suffering with you.

1759
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,960
Meg Z!

1760
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,880
Okay, bye.

1761
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,880
All right.

1762
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,520
That concludes another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1763
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:51,760
Thank you guys so much for supporting independent radio and next week we'll talk about video

1764
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,400
games at some point.

1765
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,400
We promise.

1766
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,400
See you guys later.

1767
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,400
