5893	14743	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15464	19088	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20310	23772	Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening.
23792	25553	We're taping live on February the 4th of 2007.
25793	33178	Hey, if you want to join us for a live taping sometime, it's Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
33218	50068	And yes, we know there's a big football game that just wrapped up, and folks are probably still at their parties, but here we are, because we're loyal to the show, we love you guys, and we love all of you that are in chat right now, even though there is still that football game, post-game stuff going on, and whatever show is on after it this year, and
50438	51418	and all that stuff going on.
51478	53920	So thank you guys for being loyal and tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
54580	56461	Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
56541	58121	Who's starting us off in the next segment here?
58302	69166	Well, apparently there's news that Sony was basically saying... A spokesman from Sony, Dave... His name sounds like Cracker.
70147	71808	Craker, I guess.
72568	78371	He was quoted... They were talking about the whole, you know, format wars and stuff and talking about...
80304	82506	PlayStation 3 vs. 360 and stuff.
82626	90033	And then one of the things that they were talking about also was the Nintendo Wii and saying that it wasn't even in the same category as PlayStation 3.
90153	95017	In fact, the Wii could be considered as an impulse buy more than anything else.
95778	100962	Which everyone was like, oh my god, you know, that's so crazy that he would say that, but I don't really think that's a...
102216	102837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
128058	128898	Is the Wii an impulse buy?
129258	135360	Well, tell me what average person just happens to have, you know, 350 bucks lying around.
136020	138820	You know, usually we have things to pay, like bills.
139900	141581	Or, that's a car payment, you know?
142501	144081	Well, somehow the three of us manage it.
144541	149502	Well, yeah, but we also, you know, if we were responsible about it, planned out that purchase, right?
149922	152183	Right, and I did not budget a PlayStation 3.
153123	154003	So, I didn't buy them.
154203	156944	We budgeted our PlayStation 3, we budgeted our Wii...
158268	161429	I budgeted the Wii, but I did not budget a PlayStation 3, which is why I don't have one.
162169	171432	I had to have mine three days early, so... And JV Mon in our chatroom comes back with the classic, Your mom is an impulse buy.
172292	173013	That was pretty funny.
173913	174653	That's why I said JV Mon.
174673	175153	Last night!
177034	177294	Anyhow.
178094	182376	And TheRobD says, That's what happens when it's at a lower price than $599 US dollars.
182436	183856	It's a little easier to be in it.
183916	185657	It has more than 15 games.
186357	186817	Well, I'm...
187594	188914	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
209133	211073	It's not downloading new content for me.
211594	214754	All it's doing is sending me messages that I can download some more content.
215014	217335	Fucking where is this automatic downloading shit?
217455	220936	It's there for the purpose of illuminating your living room in a blue glow.
221716	226037	Nintendo does not like to come out swinging with their stuff.
226317	227517	Haven't you noticed this about them?
227557	230258	They don't like to reveal all the secrets of their consoles.
230518	231658	Like look at what happened with the DS.
232058	235639	No one knew that thing would have voice thing over the internet or even have internet play at all.
235950	238971	I mean, it was kind of hinted at, but never was that announced.
239231	242291	But Nintendo, for whatever reason, chooses to roll this out slowly.
242872	244532	Xbox 360, they come out swinging.
245152	248253	They lay their cock out on the table and say, thwack, here you go.
248353	249813	It's all right here.
250213	259055	I mean, that's really a fundamental difference between Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo is the way they kind of... Even Sony, their online network, there's nothing on there.
259295	260696	Give me something to buy.
260776	261176	Lemmings?
262337	263378	Gran Turismo.
264418	265839	Gran Turismo's free, okay?
265899	267179	But there's still nothing to buy in there.
267199	268179	There's no new demos.
268600	270320	There's PSP download games.
270360	271201	That's completely useless.
271441	273001	Make the PSP download that shit.
273041	275922	Why do I have to have a PlayStation 3 to download this crap?
276283	281905	I mean, the PSP is capable of downloading this stuff to, you know, off the internet.
282185	285306	Or if it's, you know, going to take too long to do that, download it on your PC.
285426	286767	That should be able to be done.
287087	290008	I mean, it probably sells some more of those virtual, you know, those...
290507	291448	Thanks for watching!
305802	306323	Thanks for watching!
321861	322201	Nothing.
322302	324063	And only one game... Old games.
324504	326966	One game supports Wii Connect 24, and that's Elebits.
327046	330269	And to be honest, I haven't gotten shit from Elebits, you know, on the Wii Connect 24.
330309	333351	Would you like me to send you an Elebit picture for use in Elebits?
333752	335634	I can do this for you, so you'll stop being such a bitch.
335654	335934	No, I don't.
335974	336334	I don't.
336795	344401	But the whole thing, it's just, you know, I thought that this would eliminate the fact of me having to wait to download these updates or, you know, whatever.
344602	346083	It's just, they're not using this shit.
347403	351727	Going back to a very dirty comment I made earlier.
351787	354690	Ranma says, Xbox 360's cock puts a consumer's eye out.
355711	357692	DarkTetsuya says, Rob just likes to say cock.
358153	358593	Who doesn't?
359254	359654	Who doesn't?
360495	361215	You like to say other things.
361255	362176	I like to say all dirty words.
362196	363477	I like to say all types of dirty words.
363837	364258	Who doesn't?
365459	369222	Well, even though we saw that Sony was being cocky in that last story.
369762	370063	Get it?
370243	370643	Cock.
372349	375151	We have Nintendo accepting an award.
375991	379873	The Wii and WarioWare won an International Toy Fair award.
379913	385576	That's pretty cool, except when they said WarioWare won, they spelled it W-E-A-R.
387497	397422	Well, anyway, they won this International Toy Fair award, and they chose the Wii because, quote, encourages playing PC games in groups instead of alone, even though it's
397992	399173	Not really a PC game.
399213	400134	Well, that's a whole other story.
400894	406679	Also, quote, the product not only appeals to player types with an affinity to PCs, but also to new age groups.
407960	411904	Making it sound like I'm going to like, you know, take herbs.
411924	413145	They're talking out of their ass.
414906	418809	I think it's just these folks, you know, they don't really deal with gaming every day.
418909	419670	So it's, you know.
420148	422550	They're used to giving awards to like Tickle Me Elmo.
422910	435200	So I think that's kind of what makes this newsworthy is that the Wii has kind of jumped that boundary as becoming recognition as a toy in general and not just a gaming system.
435460	436661	Kind of interesting.
436781	437062	I don't know.
438162	439143	I still don't think they get it.
439503	442066	But I think this is pretty cool information though.
442746	446729	Atari Europe is announcing a Godzilla game for the Wii.
447470	448671	And I'm sorry for the...
449451	450892	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
475070	478292	and are aiming for the title of King of All Monsters.
478312	479853	It should be Queen, Godzilla's female.
480814	481574	She laid eggs.
482095	482335	Sorry.
482655	491001	Anyway, but it's a game that you basically work the storyline as you progress.
491041	492101	I think that's pretty cool.
492201	493662	Very dynamic.
494623	497965	Especially given that you're using the Wii controller for it.
497985	500227	Well, I'm glad to see Rampage is coming out over there.
500567	500807	Yes.
502076	502976	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
523911	524471	Thanks for watching!
546860	547641	Am I getting the finger?
547901	548021	Oh.
548641	550042	Mothra wouldn't use shit.
550102	551863	Usually when it's silent, I'm getting the finger.
551883	557167	Would Mothra just fly up into space and fly into the sun because moths are, you know, attracted to fire?
558108	559088	Moths are stupid.
559269	563071	That's a dumb... Why the hell would they create a moth, you know, monster anyways?
563131	564392	That is the dumbest thing ever.
567034	568275	But Gamera was cool.
569135	570116	Gamera is really neat.
570595	571315	FlyingTurtle.
571435	574936	The last time I played a Godzilla game was the old-ass NES game.
574976	577157	The Super NES game was fucking awesome.
577237	578037	Or was it NES?
578057	578397	I don't remember.
578437	579518	It was NES.
579638	583019	And they had a King of Monsters game, which wasn't really Godzilla, but pretty much.
583439	585099	On Neo Geo.
585499	585739	Anyway.
586320	586720	I forget it.
587340	595882	So, what's kind of interesting, though, and this is, I guess, you know, your random Nintendo game sighting.
596623	598063	They have an Easter egg in their
598544	616417	DS Dictionary thing, because we don't get any actual non-games over here, but apparently, if you look up the word for ball, you can actually find, it says one of two translations in the dictionary, one of them that's grayed out.
616677	622421	If you click on the grayed out one, it brings up the Game & Watch game, Ball, so you get to play that.
623122	624643	Kind of a little Easter egg that's thrown in there.
626084	627445	Oh, hooray, I love Ball.
629793	630974	I love Mr. Game & Watch.
648803	655926	Now, of course, a lot of these rumors come from patents and trademark offices, and that's where GoNintendo's getting their idea from.
656206	662288	Nintendo filed a punch-out trademark again in April of 2005, and it was recently updated on January 11th.
662668	677274	Now, who knows if they're just kind of holding on to it, just making sure no one else tries to take the name or whatever they're doing, but certainly when you look at something like Wii Boxing, you can't help but go, it's just a matter of time before this comes out on, you know, punch-out on the...
678640	679060	on the Wii.
679561	681441	It's too bad it won't be Mike Tyson's Punch Out, though.
682242	683963	That would be Mike Tyson's Ear Fest.
687444	689645	Or Mike Tyson's... Never mind.
689685	691306	I'm going to make a really bad joke here.
691366	693327	Let's move on before I get myself in trouble.
695528	698449	You know... I just wanted to say I really love this game.
698469	699570	I love the Nintendo Wii.
700850	704292	I'm sure his Wii... Never mind.
704412	706333	Also, I love Biting Off Ears and Rape.
707082	710123	Now this should make a lot of people very, very happy.
711003	720147	Everyone's favorite luchador, Strong Bad, is on the Wii, kinda.
721827	735392	Our favorite developer, VitElectrics, has created VDeletrics, which is a collection of some of their games that are remastered for Wii Control.
737214	744539	and the quote says the guys at VitElectrics have reworked a few of your favorite games for use on your favorite wave around controller game system.
745720	746841	I think that is great.
747341	757948	You have Strong Bad Zone, Secret Collect, Kid Speedy, More to Come, Population Tire, and More to Come.
759449	766154	You can basically go to your Wii browser to the I guess
767242	772085	It's the VitElectrics page that, of course, is associated with HomestarRunner.com.
773506	780630	But it's V-I-D-E-L-E-C-T-R-I-X dot com slash V-I-I-V-E.
782165	787387	You know, I predicted a while ago Homestar Runner was going to jump the shark and sell out to, like, Cartoon Network, but I guess I've been wrong.
787467	790849	They still have been just kind of trekking along with their web following there.
791169	795971	But now it's interesting to kind of see them tiptoeing into the console games a little bit, you know?
796112	805016	I actually think it's pretty great that this started off as, you know, kind of not that great books for children, and it just turned into this big internet phenomenon.
805036	805536	Yeah.
806620	809321	It just goes to show that good things come to those who wait, right?
809461	812382	We need a Peasants Tale the game on Wii.
812662	817744	So since we've been doing this show five years now, just about, we should be getting those rewards anytime soon now, huh?
818305	818565	Right?
818825	819065	Yeah?
819905	820525	That was funny.
820666	822626	We'll just be right here waiting for you.
823046	824227	La la la la la.
824407	832130	Anyways, other things you can do with your Wii, of course, non-kosher things like modding it.
833666	840210	In fact, there have been three teams that have been releasing their announcements for Wii mod chips.
840370	846493	So, before or not, we're going to have backups and region-free Wiis, which is always good.
846874	848455	Well, the region-free part, at least.
850223	866673	One of these teams, Team Cyclops, they announced their Wii mod chip, which is supposed to be able to play backups of both Wii and GameCube games, GameCube Homebrew, imports of GameCube games, as well as DVD-R and support.
867794	871536	And you're supposed to be able to have it as stealth as well.
872356	877960	One other one that's actually supposed to be coming out pretty soon is called the Wii Key.
879020	885301	And that one's also going to be able to be updated via DVD, so it's supposed to be future-proof, much like the PlayStation 3.
886182	896084	And it's supposed to be able to play backups of both Wii and GameCube games, different region GameCube games and backups, multi-disc games, and etc.
896544	904085	So, you know, this one's actually supposed to start shipping on February 7th, so maybe we'll find out a little bit more of this next week.
905025	905866	Hmm, interesting.
906626	907306	Are you going to order one?
908523	911045	I don't know how to solder for shit, so probably not.
911245	912166	I thought you used to do that.
914008	916650	If you've seen any of my solder jobs, they're awful.
917050	922854	You know somebody who has a very expensive soldering iron who has experience with doing these types of things now?
924195	924396	You?
925456	925977	My hubby.
926998	928098	Oh, yeah, from the pinball stuff.
928138	930640	He fixes his own pinball machines and has put together his main cabinets.
930660	931701	Let's get him to mod your Wii.
931901	932142	Maybe.
932362	932622	All right.
933001	940064	Well, anyhow, one thing that you can do on the Wii, of course, is play old games, which is funny because, you know, most people want to hack them to install emulators on them.
940084	941104	But the Wii has one built in.
941804	949167	But the emulators are not perfect, as folks are finding out this week in downloading Mario Kart 64, because you cannot save ghost data in Mario Kart 64.
949407	949988	And guess what?
950368	960952	Nintendo says, quote, due to unavoidable technical reasons, unfortunately, it is not possible to save ghost data from Mario 64's time trials in the virtual console version of the game.
961727	970173	They did place messages advising users about this before they download the game when the Wii Shop channel is first accessed and in the More Details tab on the individual game page.
970413	970993	And that's true.
971033	972394	I did notice that in the manual.
972494	974395	They're in big red letters.
974675	976016	You can't save ghost data.
976377	978758	I honestly think people are making too big a deal out of this.
979258	983941	I didn't have a memory pack when I owned Mario Kart 64, so I never had ghost data anyway.
984242	986343	I mean, how many people had a Nintendo 64, let alone the memory pack?
990134	990655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1009271	1011732	Like virtual memory cards on the PlayStation 3.
1011792	1021497	But you'd be talking about going in and editing Mario Kart 64's game information to do that, because it'd be talking about accessing data a whole other way.
1022097	1024558	You have to rewrite the game, recompile the game.
1024578	1027119	Perhaps they could patch it with, I don't know...
1028649	1030231	Weekend Act 24 that they're not using?
1030311	1030972	They're not going to do it.
1030992	1032133	Nintendo says they're not going to do it.
1032333	1035957	The PC emulators, though, always saved the information.
1036238	1044327	Well, the ROMs themselves actually have the emulator built into it when you're downloading it, so it wouldn't be that hard for them to fix that.
1045027	1046409	All they have to do is edit the emulator.
1047330	1047650	But no.
1048837	1049758	Yeah, why should they?
1049778	1052021	Because no one really cares about that shit anyways.
1052061	1054544	Well, Legend of Zaku agrees and says, ghost data?
1054564	1055485	Who the fuck uses that?
1055505	1058709	And that's probably followed up by Boko Fett saying, I love ghost mode.
1059330	1061913	And Rob D seems to agree they could include a patch with the game.
1061933	1064897	This is all coming from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1065678	1068481	Hitstun says, oh, come on, you can't emulate a friggin' controller pack?
1069718	1071939	NM64 says, Sky, I think you only download the emulator once per system.
1098730	1100591	I'm not sure on the specifics of that, possibly.
1100871	1104592	But you see, the thing though is once you've purchased the game, you can delete it and re-download it again.
1104752	1109993	So if that's the case, they can say, okay, there's an update to this game, please re-download it, and boom, done.
1110033	1112714	Or I thought WeConnect24 was supposed to do all that automatically.
1113114	1117835	Right, WeConnect24 is a service that they sell but don't actually fucking use.
1118215	1119215	But that's not a surprise.
1119235	1121036	They did the same thing on the DS.
1121616	1122136	Same thing.
1123837	1124257	Anyhow.
1124937	1125577	Yeah, anyhow.
1126089	1126429	DarkSakura.com
1149682	1151464	Slim Pickens this week, though, right, DarkSakura?
1151484	1152104	Not a lot of emails?
1152364	1154046	Well, we got a bunch of big fat ones.
1154406	1154987	Oh, there you go.
1155167	1155988	We like long letters.
1156488	1159170	Well, one of the emails comes from GS191.
1159471	1165216	However, I'm not reading the part about Jennifer Strange because, honestly, I'm sick of it.
1165356	1168879	Although we appreciate the feedback, I think we're all trying to move on from that whole thing.
1168919	1169680	But thank you for your insight.
1169700	1172482	And it's pretty much a lot of the same as, you know, what we're thinking.
1172502	1172662	Yeah.
1175396	1181620	And there was also the disclaimer that we didn't have... Just because Loki wasn't on a mic, Loki said, we just can't continue to drown ourselves in that information.
1182921	1183922	It smells like meat in here.
1184142	1187144	Because he's eating a hamburger and he left the cart open, which you know what that means.
1187204	1188465	French fries stealing, fries stealing.
1188886	1190907	I'm going to take like a whole handful.
1191187	1192688	Here you go.
1192989	1196131	Hurry up and eat them.
1196511	1197452	Talk with your mouth full, hurry.
1197692	1197932	Okay.
1198472	1199693	I know the flapper map.
1201835	1202976	Poor GS191.
1203316	1204937	Gets his email read with fries in our mouth.
1205922	1209044	I'm the one reading the email.
1209065	1209305	Okay.
1210245	1212167	Now the Frapper map, the bane of my existence.
1215770	1216911	I really don't know what to do.
1216931	1222215	These are good fries.
1222375	1223256	They're elephant pie.
1223276	1223796	They're pretty good.
1224537	1225798	That one was too salty, though.
1225858	1227459	Okay.
1228940	1231322	I really don't know what to do anymore about the Frapper map.
1232364	1237046	Ever since the switch from Google Maps to Yahoo Maps, the performance of the website has gone down a lot.
1238426	1247689	We really screwed up the editing to the point that you can go to your forums, you can do that, but it takes out the shoutout listings on the Frapper page.
1249030	1251811	So you're forced to use their forums if you want to see shoutouts on the page.
1252751	1257973	Or if you use your own forums, it automatically takes the shoutouts off the page.
1258813	1260554	Being the administrator of the Frapper map
1261280	1262260	I'm at a fork in the road.
1262980	1267462	There are many times that I was so discontent with the map, I almost leave the map and start over again.
1268422	1278505	The one good thing is that there is an embedded HTML option when I customize the map, so that gives me some hope on getting this to where I like it, and hopefully everyone else does too.
1279705	1284626	Currently, the map has 141 members, but I know that there is a much larger community out there.
1285006	1287747	With more support, it will motivate me further, hopefully.
1288533	1293216	So as of now, I will keep it up, but if the Frapper screws up again, I just don't know what to do.
1293437	1296379	We'll try to support the Frapper map, and I will do my best to maintain it.
1296459	1296739	Thank you.
1296939	1297820	Look at our Frapper map.
1297860	1298400	It's pretty nice.
1298440	1299281	I have it up on screen here.
1299661	1302463	If you want to see it, it's Frapper.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1302903	1307646	And there's really nothing to this besides just the fact it's kind of cool to see where our listeners are.
1307927	1312690	And you notice we have a lot scattered throughout the U.S., but what I'm really noticing a lack of
1313340	1314781	is the pins over in the UK.
1314862	1315182	Look at that.
1315202	1316423	There's like three pins over there.
1316783	1317044	Come on.
1317084	1318525	I know we got more listeners than that over there.
1318545	1319446	And then look, Australia.
1319486	1321808	If I go over to Australia, there's like a pin.
1323510	1326673	So we want to especially not that, you know, we love our US listeners.
1326693	1330036	We want to really see some of our international listeners put a pin in the map somewhere.
1330336	1333259	But I am going to steal what they do at All Games Interactive.
1333319	1334500	I am going to replace what's over here.
1334520	1336362	We're going to put a big map up here.
1337289	1341710	and we're going to put pins in whenever we get calls and emails from different parts of the world.
1341730	1343571	We'll have one color for calls and one color for emails.
1343851	1345531	So we're going to start our own real life Frapper.
1345571	1349212	But in the meantime, the online one will have to do Frapper.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
1349332	1350753	And that was a fan created thing.
1350793	1353313	So thank you to this emailer who created it.
1353934	1354694	Hugs and kisses.
1355834	1356634	Well, next email.
1357355	1357975	Hi, guys.
1358035	1359015	DDR Dollar Bill here.
1361209	1366492	Thanks for the updates from Konami Gamers Day, which now made my picking of the newest system very difficult.
1366592	1367132	This is why.
1367893	1375056	This weekend I was in the Chinatown section here in New York, and while browsing through the anime, picked up three series I haven't seen yet.
1375597	1378238	I was also checking out the imports and had some thoughts.
1378518	1383401	In the past, in order to play imported games, most systems would need to be modified in some fashion.
1384321	1391904	I can recall back in the cartridge systems where you'd have to buy an adapter to play these games or actually just break open your Super Nintendo.
1392164	1393604	Yeah, that Super Nintendo one was funny.
1395825	1400407	Or having your CD, DVD-based systems modified with a mod chip or swap disc or paperclip.
1401147	1401407	Sorry.
1403788	1408649	I know that the Game Boy DS systems did not need any modification, which is probably why I enjoyed them the most.
1409210	1410170	My question is this.
1410660	1414622	For the systems I did not list that are current are the following true.
1414822	1420084	Xbox 360, region locked, no safe mod exists, safe as in you will not be banned from Xbox Live.
1420544	1422165	Wii, region locked, no mod exists yet.
1422225	1425727	PS3, not region locked on PS3 games, region locked on PS2 games.
1426107	1427588	PSP, not region locked.
1428228	1437212	I'm asking this because I'm going to be getting back into purchasing import titles, not just the Ben Mani stuff, but also some of their wrestling games.
1438243	1448890	which has been more original and fun than the SmackDown vs. Raw and other little oddities such as DONDBZ vs. One Piece vs. Naruto.
1449810	1458195	I don't care about playing backup copies honestly and I don't want to get one system of each as that would be a waste of money.
1458315	1462758	I wish they would just let everyone pick and choose what to play regardless of where it's coming from.
1463487	1466510	Anywho, I could go on for another hour, but I'll leave it like that.
1466950	1468131	See you guys in the chatroom tonight.
1469432	1469792	P.S.
1469892	1470833	I miss free stuff sometimes.
1471273	1478619	I do believe the PlayStation 3 regions for the game, at least Blu-ray, I know Region 1 is both Japan and the United States.
1478719	1483243	So, when we talk about importing Japanese games, I think that works.
1483543	1486726	At least, I don't know about the movies might work, but the games, I'm not sure.
1487743	1493268	Um, once again, you probably just need to check, maybe, with import sites to deal with that kind of stuff, whether that'll work or not.
1493288	1495029	360, I know, doesn't.
1495790	1500854	I'm going to be in San Francisco this weekend, so if I go by Mikado, I can ask them there, since they keep up with all that.
1501014	1508460	Yeah, I know, because I know they were saying that it is and then it isn't, but I know it's not region-free, but I think that we're in the same region as Japan now.
1509101	1509882	So... Interesting.
1510562	1510742	Yeah.
1510762	1513985	Well, that makes sense, because we're both NTSC.
1514105	1516007	Well, it's not like it's going to matter for anything in a...
1516840	1519941	High Definition Format, but I can sort of see it.
1520381	1523943	SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom says, you can use the GameCube freeloader on the Wii.
1524283	1525324	Positive, I've seen it done.
1526044	1526924	I have a freeloader.
1527244	1530486	But, that's only for GameCube games, that's not for Wii games.
1531466	1534567	Well, I'm still going to check it out though, I want to try it for myself.
1535228	1538249	That's pretty cool.
1538349	1542951	It's really only a matter of time though before anything that is region locked will be unlocked.
1543960	1549624	Um, I am one of those people who said, I'm not modding my PS2 and went out and bought a JPS2.
1550404	1551445	So... Ditto.
1551825	1552266	I did it too.
1552306	1555488	PlayStation 2 Japanese games do not work on a US PlayStation 2.
1556108	1557229	Or a PlayStation 3.
1557589	1568596	And I know somebody in chat, I think Blackboy says PS2 Japanese games work on PlayStation 3, but actually one of the sites had video of trying Kingdom Hearts 2, the import on a PlayStation 3, and it came up with an error message.
1568696	1570778	So I'm not sure if that's true.
1572359	1572439	Um...
1573683	1576745	And the one thing, though, that I am curious about, though, is the freeloader.
1578646	1584570	If they're going to have... Well, not the freeloader, but what was the one for PlayStation hard drive?
1586131	1586611	HD loader?
1586911	1587912	HD loader, that was it.
1587952	1589553	If they're going to be coming out with something like that.
1589753	1590774	I'm sure eventually, someday.
1590814	1592795	But it's still out there for the PlayStation 2s.
1592815	1599879	If you can find the old style one or even the new style one, you can download the HD loader that actually fits on your memory card.
1601020	1602781	And then you just plug in a USB drive.
1604285	1606246	or USB hard drive or something like that.
1606987	1609149	And it works great for imports.
1609869	1613212	Well, they even have the thing where you can, you know, I guess it's the same thing.
1613232	1618937	You download it directly to your hard drive on the system.
1619858	1629226	I mean, not that we're condoning that eye roll, but, you know, I wonder if they're going to have something like that for PS3 and then that makes the importing...
1630023	1636565	Or you remember back in the days with the GameCube how they had the whole GD-ROM rip through the VMU unit.
1636605	1637125	Remember that?
1638305	1640186	I wonder if they'd be doing something along those lines too.
1640466	1643927	Just to clarify, it looks like I understand why I misunderstood Blackboy.
1643967	1647408	He said, I've played Japanese PlayStation 2 games on the Japanese PlayStation 3.
1647728	1648528	Well, yeah, that'll work.
1649028	1652609	I thought he meant Japanese PlayStation 2 to US PlayStation 3, and that's what the video was of.
1652909	1653890	So, oops.
1654250	1655230	Okay.
1655310	1658191	Next email, and this comes from Neki, our friend.
1659229	1666591	Heya OLR, didn't get around to emailing last week, but I got some stuff today.
1666672	1668372	This is my second time typing this.
1668752	1671273	Since the first one screwed up, I hope it doesn't happen again.
1672193	1673694	Check out Attachment 1.
1674314	1677035	Okay, I didn't actually see there was attachments with this one.
1678175	1684898	It will show the Wii with over 4 million sales, the 360 with 10 million, and the PS3 with a tiny 1 million.
1685718	1685918	Owned.
1687065	1693587	I would just like to give a big shout out towards my home forum site, dscommunity.co.uk.
1693708	1695628	It's nice and fun, so everyone join the forums.
1696008	1696969	There's your free shout out.
1697649	1708353	Oh yeah, and by the way, we are doing a DS tournament on Wednesday starting from, it looks like July 2nd this year at about 7 to 12 p.m.
1708413	1708893	GMT.
1709353	1713055	Everyone is welcome, but it would be a good idea to join the forums first, plus we got chat.
1713335	1715115	Anyway, there's your free plug.
1715135	1715476	Free plug.
1717632	1720073	Now, did they plug us on their forums?
1720233	1721033	That's what I want to know.
1721073	1723634	Plug us on your forums now, because we're awesome.
1725234	1725754	Yes, fries.
1726174	1726415	Rock.
1726915	1731336	And so, a question for me is where it got the music... Dude, fries.
1732876	1733677	I'm, like, hungry.
1733697	1735037	I haven't eaten since those pancakes today.
1735217	1735877	Jamie, email.
1736197	1736817	Okay, sorry.
1738178	1738718	Sorry, Neki.
1741719	1743940	A question for me was where did it get the music for the show.
1744680	1744980	I really...
1747714	1753137	I really want about the FUs of the week, your website of the week, and the show's ending music.
1754818	1759921	The FUs of the week music is actually from the Final Fantasy VII Advent Children movie.
1760761	1761722	It's the One Winged Angel.
1768225	1769786	The big final battle in that movie, yep.
1770266	1773148	The website of the week music, isn't that Journey to Wonderland?
1773890	1775691	No, that's the mailbag music is Journey to the Wonderland.
1776431	1779432	Website of the week is from DDR Ohastas.
1779632	1779992	That's right.
1780012	1780652	That's candy.
1784974	1787634	You can actually dance to that in a Japanese version of DDR.
1787674	1788275	I've done it.
1788415	1788895	It's awesome.
1789015	1793676	The Ohasta is the Ohastation kids version.
1793776	1794817	It's kind of cute.
1795277	1795497	Yeah.
1796057	1798218	What was the Ohaska?
1798558	1799078	Ohaska.
1800069	1801532	It's got a lot of cute songs in it.
1801572	1801893	It's fun.
1802013	1805359	And our ending show music, Rob knows that one because it's from Beatmania.
1806361	1808946	Sakura Yamaoka, iFutureList.
1810008	1811992	Also in DDR Supernova, I believe.
1812012	1812072	Yep.
1813334	1816915	The Godly and Studly Akira Yamaoka, who produces Silent Hill now as well.
1816935	1821157	I was actually watching the making of Silent Hill 3, and he was in it, and he sounded really hoarse.
1821257	1822037	He's such a rock star.
1822057	1823958	I met him once, like three years ago.
1824218	1824738	He was pretty cool.
1824858	1825179	He was awesome.
1825219	1826039	I like his business cards.
1826539	1828880	Anyway, can't think of anything else.
1828960	1829800	Thanks for the podcast.
1829840	1830300	Really enjoy it.
1830340	1830781	Keep it up.
1830881	1831181	Nike.
1831241	1831541	P.S.
1831581	1834162	I found a Doctor Who thing you might get very excited about.
1834942	1836463	Haven't read it all as it's long.
1836903	1837963	Doctor Who the game?
1839584	1839804	Huh.
1840524	1841965	Why don't we talk about something like that?
1842365	1842565	Huh.
1844355	1845096	This is from Bandit.
1866803	1867784	Hi guys, how's it going?
1867824	1871526	Been listening to the show for a while and decided to send in an email for a change.
1871946	1876589	I just wanted to stop and voice an opinion that I've had for a while about moving to the next gen.
1877410	1886775	Sure, when you look at the shiny new hardware that's out there from the big three, you may want to go out and buy the newest and greatest, but at this point, I've seen a reason to do so yet.
1887696	1892939	After all of these years of playing games, mostly competitive type games, I've become more of a casual gamer than anything.
1893780	1896021	I find myself spending more time reading gaming
1897140	1899842	and use through various online sites than actually playing them.
1901103	1908447	It was really hard not to just throw down the cash and buy a new console on any of the launches but I had to take a step back and look at what I currently have.
1909248	1911269	The prime console I own is the PS2.
1912269	1921455	When I actually took a look back at the games that I've yet to play over the years I realized that purchasing a new console would be a bad idea especially considering the prices of games now.
1922356	1925077	I've actually never played God of War, Devil May Cry 1 or 3 and many...
1926601	1931003	and other critically acclaimed titles like these.
1931884	1933685	There's not enough time in the day to play everything.
1933925	1934825	I haven't played some of those.
1935165	1941068	I really missed a lot of great titles on the PS2 by only playing certain games such as Madden and Tekken 5.
1941929	1951994	Certainly with the case of Tekken 5, I would spend hours learning a character's move list and practicing before visiting a group of the best local players here in Pittsburgh who go by the name of Steel City Tekken.
1952654	1955696	Believe me, the practice had to be done to stand a chance against them.
1956889	1957569	Thanks for watching!
1975962	1977984	The price of one $60 next-gen title.
1978524	1988852	So if you haven't yet made the commitment to any new next-gen console, I would go as far as to say that the PS2 has one of the two greatest library of games ever on any console.
1989092	1992394	The original NES will always be first, in my opinion.
1993055	1995036	Also remember that the PS2 is not dead yet.
1995076	1999940	We still have Luminous Live, God of War 2, and Final Cut of Kingdom Hearts 2 to play soon.
2001069	2005630	Since I decided to stick with the PS2 a little longer, I went out and picked up a few games that I missed.
2005710	2013573	I grabbed Syphon Filter Omega Stream, Devil May Cry Collector's Box Set, and Area 51, not the original that was in the arcades on the PS1 Saturn, for less than $60.
2014133	2017394	A 5 to 1 game ratio really sounds good to me right now.
2018094	2021655	I could write much more to prove my point, but I'm sure everyone can see where I'm coming from.
2021895	2023616	Anyway, have a great show, and long live the PS2.
2024997	2028439	I stopped playing Kingdom Hearts 2 as soon as they announced the final cut because I'm going to start over on that one

2067259	2068660	I apologize for taking so long.
2068720	2070721	I definitely recommend that you give this series a try.
2071182	2074624	The first Shadow Hearts game, however, is hard to find, so you might have to find it on eBay.
2075064	2076885	I'm interested in your opinions about the series.
2077125	2077806	Have a great night.
2078026	2078746	Shadow Next Gen.
2079967	2082829	And we have various links to them, so I'm going to check them out a little bit later.
2083589	2084730	Shadow Hearts, the series?
2085150	2085330	Yeah.
2085651	2088452	I know the last one that came out, New World, looked pretty good.
2089073	2093135	I just didn't play it because I don't have time to play every obscure RPG out there.
2093556	2093956	But, um,
2094656	2095456	Yeah, it looked pretty cool.
2095496	2099699	It's kind of a unique concept, kind of set in the 1940s, I believe.
2100499	2122732	And you play like a detective son who ends up finding these portals to another dimension almost, and this stuff starts coming through and basically has to fight it with a bunch of your usual typical RPG plot, a bunch of people that have no reason to be together, kind of come together and then
2123410	2125812	Fight Monsters and stuff.
2125832	2129674	It looks like a lot of folks in the chatroom agree with my gamer ADD perspective.
2130534	2133096	Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, you're not the only one who does that.
2133436	2135538	Paradox Vincent says, OMG, thank you, Sky.
2135598	2136158	Thank you, thank you.
2136198	2136858	I'm not alone.
2136878	2138039	That's why I play music games.
2138439	2150567	And I think, to go back to what I had said in Part A about somebody had said all I ever seem to play are Xbox Live Arcade games, I think that might go help to explain it right there is that Xbox Live Arcade games, again, they're quick and not a lot of time and really satisfy my gamer ADD.
2151587	2154269	Yet why I keep going back to World of Warcraft, I'll never understand.
2154309	2155690	I think it's the social aspect of that.
2156370	2160033	My whole thing is, that's sort of why I was stuck on Cooking Mama for that long.
2161035	2183910	But you know, I was thinking about it, and I own a lot of games that I haven't given the attention that I'd like to give So like, I'm going back, I've started over on Popola Cross, just because you know how I was up in arms about how much I wanted to play that game You know, for years, and so I actually started over on Popola Cross so I can get to where I got before and actually play through it this time
2184335	2185496	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2208616	2211378	We're not getting paid to play games eight hours a day.
2211418	2212718	If somebody wanted to do that, great.
2212778	2221784	I mean, because essentially that's what you do when you visit those big websites like, you know, I'm not going to name them, but the ones that are sponsored by magazine companies and things.
2222104	2232570	I mean, keep in mind, like, just my next week, I'm going to school four nights next week, doing a CPR class, working on a website, working on art commissions, and working full time.
2233170	2235091	So, I mean, that's a standard week.
2235691	2236652	You know, I...
2237782	2247185	We don't get to have free time all the time to do all the stuff that we would like to do, to play all the games.
2247305	2248985	But when I do have free time, it's all about the games.
2249385	2260528	What I was trying to say is that that's why when we do the show, we actually come and tell each other so that we can each give each other the impression of what we're looking at.
2260669	2265830	What's quick and easy to play, what's going to be a little time consuming, what project's going on, that type of thing.
2267105	2267946	and no more email, by the way.
2268066	2268446	Makes sense.
2268746	2270167	Except I got some spam, which I deleted.
2271348	2271849	I can say this.
2272029	2279374	I got an email and I neglected to mention this during housekeeping, but I'll mention it next week so it's at the top of the show because I know not everyone listens to the whole thing.
2279754	2290362	But I do want to confirm that Orange Lingerie is going to be back at Faname Con this year, which is being held from May 25th to May 28th at the San Jose Convention Center in California.
2293344	2293665	Right?
2294465	2295506	I'll be there for the weekend.
2297498	2298740	I just found this out too.
2299982	2306050	Dan's younger brother, his stepbrother, is getting married the weekend before that.
2306631	2309695	So I will definitely be there Saturday and Sunday.
2310176	2312699	Or Friday afternoon if I can at all.
2313360	2314181	FanimeCon is the sideshow.
2341559	2349084	I definitely need to remake my Tamari costume because the last one that was made was too big.
2349104	2351586	I'm actually thinking about starting to watch Bleach.
2370150	2394859	I watch Bleach and I pour it in the washer alright anyways so not having anything to do with Bleach or anime or anything like that apparently well unless you lived under a rock or something you probably didn't realize well Vista just came out all 50 billion OMG it did?
2395139	2398520	yeah really I'm just rushing right out to go buy it
2398939	2399939	Like I did with XP.
2402000	2413722	But if you happen to be gaming on a PC that has the parental control set on it, it might actually break some of your casual games like games that use Wild Tangent.
2414462	2418963	And according to your gamer, DirectX creator Alex St.
2419003	2426905	John says basically that they tried making sure that it wouldn't break
2427883	2455048	all the different games out there they thought they covered everything but unfortunately Wild Tangent is denoted as spyware by the anti-spyware applications in Vista and says normally the software is generally harmless but it does get installed without isn't Wild Tangent the games that come with AOL Instant Messenger because those games are spyware I'm sorry yeah I think so Wild Tangent is spyware so
2455765	2460728	Whatever, I mean, it's not a huge deal, but just thought you might want to know.
2461209	2468414	Because there are some people that like casual games like Christopher and... Blackboy says, wow, Loki's news is old, they patched this already.
2469695	2470455	Yes, it is old.
2471196	2473097	And, you know, it's just like, I don't care.
2473477	2479301	But nevertheless, you know, isn't it funny that they rolled out an operating system and it broke half the games on it?
2479642	2481943	I mean, why should I upgrade to Windows Vista?
2481963	2482424	Anybody?
2482444	2482784	Anybody.
2483496	2487098	Would anybody like to tell me why I need to drop the money right now to upgrade to Windows Vista?
2487118	2487638	I'm not going to.
2487658	2488599	Because you have to upgrade your computer, too.
2488619	2489359	Because I don't, what?
2489379	2490800	You've got to upgrade your computer, too.
2490880	2493181	I don't understand why I need to upgrade right now.
2493742	2494462	I'm not.
2494562	2497424	This is all the more reason for me to just buy my iMac.
2498064	2498744	Screw Windows.
2500405	2502867	I mean, between the PC I have now and the Mac, I'm doing just fine.
2503347	2504267	I don't need Windows Vista.
2504668	2504888	What?
2505068	2506849	You look like you want to say something smart-ass so bad.
2507649	2508130	It's hurting you.
2508170	2508650	Whatever.
2508690	2509310	That's fine.
2509330	2509751	That's fine.
2509771	2511191	You guys are fine with your Macs.
2511211	2512332	That's great, you know.
2513240	2514520	I'm sure games will come to it eventually.
2515561	2519162	I don't play PC games, and the only PC game I play is World of Warcraft.
2519622	2521423	And I have Guild Wars on my laptop, so I don't have to worry about it.
2522443	2525424	JeremyTodd1 says, There's no reason to upgrade right now.
2525484	2526045	Simple as that.
2526085	2528385	Just upgrade in a couple of years and there's actually a reason to upgrade.
2529746	2532427	DDRDollarBill says, Vista has had a lot of returns.
2532807	2533027	Ouch.
2535068	2535528	So we'll see.
2535568	2535968	Maybe later.
2537769	2538029	Ha.
2538089	2539690	Vista doesn't run anything.
2540690	2540810	Um...
2541331	2541752	DarkSakura.com
2560402	2560782	DarkSakura.com
2578715	2579316	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2603680	2611545	We look forward to extending that commitment with this expansion as well as with future Blizzard releases.
2612126	2617790	So it sounds like if we get it here, you're going to get it in China from the 9, even if it is a little bit later on.
2618070	2620051	You have to just wait for all the localization and stuff.
2620231	2626515	Well, we have to do that for Japanese games, so it's only fair that that side of the world has to wait for us once in a while.
2626956	2628617	Oh, and then they get the joy of patching.
2629594	2630034	Oh, how beautiful.
2630054	2632695	Then you get to patch World of Warcraft seven times before you can play it.
2632715	2633076	It's so much fun.
2633136	2635557	And then it won't patch, and then you have to download it and do it yourself.
2635997	2636117	Oh.
2636777	2637097	Anyway.
2637838	2639078	Actually, can I suggest this real quick?
2639619	2641960	X-Fire has a patching system built in that's actually pretty good.
2642260	2647002	I have to say, you wouldn't think I would usually endorse a program like X-Fire, but it actually is really cool.
2647302	2648543	I really like X-Fire.
2649183	2652164	I think that's a great little application, anyway, for a PC gamer.
2652264	2652765	Anyway, sorry.
2652785	2653665	Well, take your word for it, Rob.
2653785	2654385	Yeah, please do.
2654666	2654846	Okay.
2656494	2660698	Speaking of MMOs, there is an MMO coming to the UK.
2661358	2662820	It's called Two Worlds.
2664021	2666423	It's being released on a PC and Xbox 360.
2666503	2675551	The good thing about it, it's a free-roaming RPG that's the orc versus human deal.
2678654	2680376	But the cool thing is that it's...
2684093	2685174	I'm getting tongue-tied today.
2686534	2695839	It has unique quests, a one-on-one arena battle, horse races, and customizable characters with no level capping.
2696759	2697560	So that's pretty cool.
2698560	2700901	I can truly be a god character in that game.
2701281	2704083	I hear it's very similar to... Oblivion.
2704203	2704383	Yeah.
2704403	2705183	Very similar to Oblivion.
2705684	2708485	JeremyTel1 wants to point out and clarify from what he's read about the game.
2708505	2710966	The 360 version only has 8-player multiplayer.
2711046	2712587	Only the PC version is an MMO.
2713448	2714468	8 players is still not bad.
2714988	2715589	That's still fun.
2715629	2716669	That's still an OL army.
2717809	2718469	And 8 players.
2718509	2719030	That'll be fun.
2719230	2721750	Now, here's what I want to know, because I haven't really read up on much.
2722230	2727752	I wonder if Crackdown is more than two players co-op, because that'd be awesome if you have like four people.
2728692	2728852	Hmm.
2728892	2729592	I don't know.
2730413	2733594	I guess we'll see more when the game comes out, because if it's coming on 360, we'll probably get a demo.
2734254	2734654	So who knows?
2735714	2735894	Yeah.
2736434	2737074	Anyways, so...
2740370	2741631	3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures
2762545	2767967	Um, so that's gonna become an Alien Hominid HD, which is kind of an HD upgrade to the original Alien Hominid game.
2768447	2771108	Uh, Band of Bugs, which is supposed to be by Ninja Bee.
2771128	2773309	It's kind of a, I guess, a strategy game.
2774109	2774770	Uh, it's kind of neat.
2775170	2776310	Castlevania Symphony of Night.
2776570	2777531	No big surprise there.
2777811	2778431	Uh, Catan.
2778771	2779491	Uh, Settlers Catan.
2779511	2782413	Remember, that was one that was rumored to be coming at some point.
2782593	2782833	Eats.
2783313	2784033	Chowdown.
2784633	2786094	Um, kind of a
2786858	2789380	Different game, I guess it's a port of a PC title by the same name.
2790621	2794523	Luxor 2, which should make Nelly happy, another kind of Zuma clone type of thing.
2795524	2798006	Paperboy, Rootbeard Tapper.
2798766	2800387	Paperboy and Rootbeard Tapper are awesome.
2800408	2805971	I know you guys bitch about the classic coin-op ports, but these are some true classics that are underrated, I think.
2806252	2811895	And then my favorite of the list here, Worms HD is going to be coming out, and that's awesome.
2812716	2815018	We used to have epic Worms...
2817422	2818102	Worms is awesome.
2818322	2819043	You know what's interesting, though?
2819443	2824206	We neglected to say this in our coverage of Konami Gamers Day, but did you notice they had nothing on Xbox Live Arcade?
2824666	2828788	I was very surprised we didn't see Castlevania Symphony of the Night on our Live Arcade, because they had it at CES.
2829389	2833751	I would have thought that's what they would have used their 360s for instead of showing Wii 11.
2834092	2837514	That's kind of what I thought we were going to see, too, but I guess not.
2837734	2838094	That's all right.
2839701	2839861	XBOXLIVE
2858326	2861469	That's without Halo 3 beta stuff.
2861789	2866414	I don't know if people are maybe downloading this to see if it's worth it, if they want to do the Halo 3.
2866514	2867855	I've played the demo.
2868095	2869036	I couldn't get into it.
2869276	2873580	I'll have to do co-op with somebody who can kind of show me what the hell I'm supposed to be doing because I didn't get it.
2874675	2875295	I'm stupid sometimes.
2875335	2879577	You can punch people and throw them in the cars and then throw cars on top of them.
2880377	2881778	I'll try it again.
2881798	2888300	What's great, though, is they have achievements for throwing dead bodies into the air and then bouncing rockets off of them.
2888781	2892482	I'll just have to come over and watch you play at some point and see if it's worth it for me.
2892662	2896964	I swear I'm going to sign up for a game rental site or something this week so I stop buying all this stuff new.
2897404	2897764	We'll see.
2899685	2902986	Anyhow, I guess that's all I have to say about Crackdown.
2904246	2915154	Well, there is different games to be downloaded, especially Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live Arcade.
2916575	2929565	They were talking about the memory card coming out that was supposed to be 256 megabytes, but the pre-order on GameStop's website is 512 megabytes for the portable memory.
2930846	2932587	So in other words, they gave it a secret upgrade.
2932907	2933127	Now it's 512.
2934620	2936281	or is it a typo on GameStop's end?
2936301	2937362	What do you think, Loki?
2937662	2949708	I haven't heard of anything official about them upgrading that, although I'm assuming that we'll find something new or find out something about it pretty soon, if not at all.
2949888	2951909	It seems kind of logical that would happen, though, right?
2952770	2953030	Yeah.
2953650	2960414	I mean, it makes sense, because 256, to me, the price point for it was a bit more expensive, and I mean, really...
2961343	2962964	I don't know why you'd buy a memory unit anyways.
2963024	2965206	I mean, spend the extra money and just get a hard drive.
2965226	2966026	That's what I say.
2966126	2969829	Just get the damn hard drive, unless you really have a need to take that shit with you on the go.
2969889	2970810	There's really no point.
2971110	2971570	Exactly.
2972971	2976333	So, yeah, no idea if this is official yet.
2976433	2982638	I imagine, I don't think it's going to be a typo, because I think originally they had 256 on there, so they probably just got it updated.
2982838	2983218	Interesting.
2984279	2984599	I don't know.
2984679	2985700	I'll keep my eyes out.
2986160	2986741	Please do.
2986861	2987321	Eyes and ears.
2988001	2988842	So we'll have to check them out.
2990854	3003940	Anywho, beyond the bigger memory cards, there is going to be another epic game coming to the Xbox 360, as well as a PlayStation 3 Unreal Tournament.
3005201	3014845	One unique thing about this, and I think we mentioned this back on an earlier show, they're going to be allowing mods to be used on the PlayStation 3 and the 360 version, probably as well as the PC.
3016204	3020547	Of course, they're also going to be including user-created mods as well.
3021088	3029436	So that's actually kind of cool that they're allowing mods on there, because I know there's been some pretty good mods available for, you know, just Unreal and Half-Life 2 and stuff.
3029696	3032298	It'd be really cool to see some of the stuff downloadable online.
3034660	3036382	Although, no idea when this game's coming out.
3037145	3039326	I like the idea of user mods coming out online.
3039866	3051753	I mean, the only time I can think of user-created content outside of an MMO that I've seen on Xbox, it would be DDR steps on DDR Ultramix 2 through 4 or whatever had the steps you could download online.
3052313	3055555	So you don't see a whole lot of user-created content, so that's kind of cool, I think.
3055775	3055935	Yeah.
3057622	3063426	Also, what's kind of cool, a Flash-based computer game called N. Which I used to play religiously.
3063666	3065747	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
3066908	3069309	Describe N. I've never played N. What is N all about, Loki?
3069530	3076354	N kind of has this stick figure, like ninja type of character that you run around and you're collecting... Oh, God, I've watched you play this game before.
3076534	3078415	I know what... Okay, sorry, keep going.
3078939	3080560	So anyways, it's pretty awesome though.
3080580	3090443	You just run around and you collect stuff and there's like, as the levels get, you know, go on it gets harder and harder and there's like missiles and stuff you have to dodge and you just have to make it through like the time limit and stuff.
3090563	3092024	I've totally seen you play this game before.
3092064	3092844	Okay, now I know what it is.
3093104	3095905	Well, N Plus is coming out on Live Arcade later this year.
3095945	3096765	Will you be buying that?
3096885	3097065	Yes.
3097285	3098226	Alright, very cool.
3098686	3107889	Of course, who knows how long it's going to get delayed because by this time we were supposed to see Castle Crashers but, you know, not that we're bitter or anything like the rest of you.
3109153	3110854	The website of the week is thecastlevaniadungeons.com
3138950	3149515	You can get there by going to castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com I will be, of course, posting a link in the chatroom, which I have actually already done once today.
3149976	3155178	Because I was posting links to images of the original Rondo of Blood.
3155578	3160781	But if you go into the site, it has write-ups on every one of the games.
3161501	3164463	In fact, the first thing that you see is actually a big screen print of...
3165382	3194567	The updated Rondo of Blood There's artwork, multimedia, emulation, fanfiction It's really cool I've actually been going on this site in upwards of 8 years now It really is the, I'd have to say, most in-depth Castlevania site ever And really, I can't say good enough about it It really is up there In fact, this site actually, if Dan told me right
3195094	3202320	inspired his site that he used to have back in the day, which was Neo Strider's Strider Zone, if you wouldn't ever remember that.
3202841	3203982	Nerds.
3204082	3207064	I did his graphics for him, so it's partly my site too.
3207525	3210047	But Casting the Dungeon is just fantastic.
3210447	3212189	Kudos to the folks that run it.
3212589	3216973	You guys have been just keeping it awesome for years and so cool.
3217694	3218074	So go there.
3218894	3220255	Now, I mean, after the show.
3220335	3223316	Why am I not surprised the Castlevania site made it for her website of the week?
3223456	3225778	Well, it was going to be History.com.
3226298	3228319	Now you just gave away what next week was likely to be.
3228359	3230020	No, next week isn't History.com.
3230520	3231981	I am completely shocked.
3232581	3233622	Completely shocked.
3233662	3234222	That's what I thought.
3234922	3240325	Anyways, there are some other weird news that managed to leak out this week.
3241065	3247869	This website, DVD Empire, they were making big news about exiting the video game business.
3248424	3254549	and apparently gave their top 8 reasons why they are leaving the game business.
3254689	3257452	Now, most people are like, who the fuck's DVD Empire?
3257912	3263156	Well, the only way I've heard of them before is because, well, a couple reasons.
3263317	3268401	One, they're the legit side of adult DVD Empire, which, you know, is big on adult movies.
3269786	3272148	The other thing is, we actually sell to them.
3273289	3275912	Or we did at one time, I guess, because now they're out of the business.
3276753	3285882	But I just thought it was interesting, some of the reasons that they mentioned that they're leaving the game's business, because it actually doesn't make any sense.
3287524	3289105	And I don't think a lot of sites are covering this.
3289225	3290827	Well, let me just real quickly go down the list.
3291937	3294699	1.
3292038	3294699	Video game industry does not care.
3295000	3299643	The video game industry only cares about the mass emergence like Toys R Us, Walmart, Best Buy, etc.
3299683	3305468	They completely ignore the needs and wants of medium or small game retailers and blow with how they do it.
3305948	3307889	Well, that's sort of true.
3308109	3312693	I mean, you're not going to be able to bring in a retail kiosk or anything like that if you're a small guy.
3313113	3314594	You have to be doing a lot of business with them.
3315595	3317056	They can't make money, they say.
3318017	3320098	Which is funny because I have a lot of customers that do make money.
3320299	3320759	Lots of it.
3323034	3327756	You may not care whether or not we make money, but we continue to pay to sell video games.
3328276	3330896	It is impossible for us to make money selling video games.
3330996	3334297	Video game manufacturers set the price using what they call MSRP.
3335117	3337698	Here's an example of the video gaming industry greed.
3337738	3340539	They set the retail price at $5 above product costs.
3341079	3341939	Buy it for $54.99, sell it for $59.99.
3341979	3342799	That is completely untrue.
3346747	3352750	Their price, which I happened to, after reading this, I looked it up, is way below that price.
3352930	3360814	In fact, I think they were, at least for us, buying 6%, or their discount was our cost plus 6%.
3361995	3365397	So they were actually paying 6% over what we paid for it.
3365857	3371600	So they were still making tons of money on this stuff, and there's never that type of margins on stuff at all.
3371880	3375722	So I don't know what the fuck they're talking about there, and they can definitely make money off of that stuff.
3376397	3379779	They're also saying no price protections, games dropping price quickly.
3380299	3384462	These guys used to buy one piece of different things at a time.
3384662	3386623	So they wouldn't have a large inventory.
3386643	3387564	That wouldn't even apply.
3387804	3390946	No returns, that's all over the industry.
3391807	3393227	They say distribution is dumb.
3393668	3395689	I don't know who their rep was, so that might be the case.
3395849	3400312	They say basically that they get their product three days after street date.
3400372	3403074	Well, unless they are a big chain company...
3404221	3410705	They won't get any product on street date because you have to be direct with the actual publishers in order to get stuff on street date.
3410865	3412727	So that's, they're just stupid.
3413527	3418530	And better suited for brick and mortar retailers, that might be true, but either way, they're just bitching and moaning.
3418911	3420372	So, good riddance.
3421753	3433160	Travis Donovan from our own Saturday Night program here at Orange Lounge Radio says, I tried ordering from them back in 02 and it took three weeks to get my order and then it was wrong and then another month and a half to get what I ordered.
3433615	3434936	All their games are now 20% off.
3436116	3438798	I'm sure you were buying games and not porno, right, Travis?
3440839	3447283	Yeah, and, well, the other thing, too, they were talking about here, there's some updates at the bottom of their little bitch page here.
3448019	3449021	They have three different updates.
3449181	3452585	One of them says, we knew about the low profit margins when developing our game sufficient.
3452605	3453727	Then why are you bitching?
3454087	3456871	Why did they put up a bitch page in the first place?
3456891	3458172	That's kind of unprofessional.
3458192	3458673	It's so retarded.
3459074	3462698	And then the other one, people responded to our news with, well, your model sucked.
3462718	3464621	You should have sold used games and accessories.
3467234	3467955	Let me put it this way.
3468335	3473299	There are retailers and smaller guys that sell a lot more than you guys do.
3474580	3479203	I don't know if we were their only distributor, but if we were, they weren't buying anything.
3479283	3480684	They weren't hardly buying anything.
3482085	3483726	They are just really whining.
3484487	3485187	Get out of the business.
3486889	3494394	Well, one thing I'm sure will be successful, no matter how it's delivered to folks, would be a Katamari Damacy online game.
3494963	3495984	Catamari Damacy Online
3520592	3521093	DarkSakura.com
3542819	3543059	All right.
3543459	3548242	Well, we would like to take this opportunity to welcome your phone calls at this time by opening up our Skype line.
3548722	3551644	Our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3551964	3554125	That number is toll-free in the United States and Canada.
3554545	3558447	If you'd rather, though, or if you're in another country, you should call us on Skype.
3558768	3560949	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3560969	3567452	You can get more detail by going to our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com, and clicking on Interact With Us.
3567973	3572355	So while we wait for some phone calls, do you have any last-minute news, some real quick last-minute news, anyone?
3572657	3574178	Yes, real quick.
3575019	3575980	A couple things.
3576080	3579543	There's some stuff being developed for the PSP homebrew stuff.
3580063	3582325	One of these is the Legend of Zelda Quest for Link.
3583266	3587590	And actually it looks kind of cool, kind of resembles the Super Nintendo Zelda.
3587830	3590752	So if you want to check that, PSP Updates has the link for you.
3591553	3596357	And then there's also one that looks like a cross between Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Biohazard.
3597078	3601021	Biohazard 2 version 2.0 final has been released.
3601716	3603957	and yeah, it looks exactly like Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
3624517	3626759	It was 1230 when I was over here.
3634959	3635479	should be said.
3635499	3645622	Again, I love all games, but their phone system, I don't know if it happens to you when you call in, but you hear yourself echoing, and it totally bugs.
3646423	3647323	Oh, I agree.
3647443	3650444	I couldn't hear anything they were saying, so it was tough.
3650684	3654265	It hasn't always been that way, because I've been on the show before, and I didn't have that.
3654565	3656906	But anyway, is that all you wanted to say?
3656926	3657486	No, two more things.
3657506	3657966	Okay, what else?
3658863	3661044	Sam and Max is great on GameTap.
3661084	3662485	I've been enjoying myself with it.
3662645	3666847	I freaking updated GameTap this week, meaning to play it, and then I got sucked into something else.
3667547	3669528	I played one of those stupid arcade games.
3669868	3673870	Well, that too, but you know, because GameTap has like 800 games on it.
3674110	3680272	So it's like you go there, I'm like, oh, I'm going to finally play Myst Online or Sam and Max, and then I'm like, holy shit, they put this game on there?
3680292	3681593	I've totally got to play that game.
3681693	3684294	So I think it was like Rainbow Islands or some crap.
3684314	3685175	I know, ADD.
3685595	3685815	I know.
3685855	3686375	You're ADD.
3686495	3687015	Yeah, there it is.
3687155	3688256	You have gamer ADD as well?
3689125	3689545	I do.
3689725	3692047	I couldn't finish Hitman, and that made me mad.
3692527	3693988	I wanted to finish it, and it gave me mad.
3695168	3695949	What else is on your mind?
3696989	3700191	Okay, I have to tell you about the Mario Kart 64 thing.
3702679	3703659	I have to tell you why.
3703819	3705520	Why the save ghost thing?
3705880	3712721	It's because the Wii, the emulator for the N64 doesn't realize that it's not an N64 before.
3712961	3715602	It's running on a Wii, so it's thinking it's on an N64.
3715782	3716902	That's what an emulator is.
3717322	3723904	But it's thinking that it's an N64 and it's thinking that it has an N64 pack in it.
3724724	3725904	It thinks it needs that.
3726511	3729212	It needs that, but in retrospect, it doesn't have it.
3729433	3736917	I kind of sort of was implying that when I said that in order to make it work, they would have to go and recode the game itself.
3737357	3739698	And that's a lot more than just trying to emulate it correctly.
3739798	3745361	But you're right, they would have to recode the game to instead of looking for the memory pack, look for the Wii's memory.
3745481	3749483	And that's not something that's easily done with a 15-year-old... No, how old is that game?
3749503	3749943	10 years old?
3750144	3750944	With a 10-year-old game.
3752646	3759412	I know that other emulated sites like Project, I'm not going to say the rest, but they got through that.
3759452	3762095	The Wii, it's built up emulation.
3762315	3764697	It's only going to pull what it thinks.
3764717	3768200	The save states on the cartridge will work fine on the Wii.
3768601	3771003	It's just those cartridge games might not.
3771683	3772303	Well, we shall see.
3772583	3774144	You know, I do want to say this, though.
3774184	3779085	I do agree that Nintendo definitely should use that patching feature to fix some of these things.
3779125	3780786	I mean, not so much the ghost thing.
3780806	3782106	I could care less about that.
3782426	3786947	But I would just love to see them give little bonuses, especially the multiplayer.
3787867	3791248	Especially with the old-ass 8-bit games like Mario Brothers.
3791328	3794309	How much more valuable would games like that be if we could play those online?
3794649	3795149	Seriously.
3795930	3796810	Just one more second.
3797010	3797310	All right.
3797350	3797630	Yeah.
3798021	3801764	Yeah, and I thought the emulation was good on the N64.
3802104	3807349	Like, wouldn't you be pissed if you played Mario and it was off, like, one millisecond?
3808169	3808369	Yeah.
3809771	3810932	All right, that's all I have to say.
3811212	3824823	All right, I do want to say one other thing, though, about the emulation, is that one thing, you know, having the widescreen HD and everything, I noticed that the Xbox 360 is smart enough to put the vertical letterbox on my games when I'm playing something that's not widescreen, but the Nintendo Wii is not.
3825931	3828812	and I really wish it was and that is not a very hard fix.
3829113	3835376	And yes, I realize I could dig up the TV remote and switch it that way but it's so much easier when the system just does it automatically.
3836016	3837737	I would love to see Nintendo make that little patch.
3838457	3840318	You're right and that's it.
3840338	3841418	I want you to get another call.
3841618	3842279	No problem.
3842319	3845840	Thank you Raven Stolfen for your opinion as always.
3847281	3850263	He had his agenda tonight and he has one, two, three agenda.
3850303	3850723	Bravo.
3850883	3851243	Good job.
3851786	3856148	All right, we welcome your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or the Skype line.
3856488	3857589	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3857609	3857989	Who's this?
3858789	3859209	Hey, what's up?
3859269	3861470	It's the Rob D. Hi, the Rob D. How are you doing?
3861971	3862511	Not too bad.
3862551	3866813	Well, actually, I'm a little bit sad, but it has nothing to do with anything other than the Super Bowl.
3867893	3869394	I'm from Chicago.
3869434	3874516	We're not too big on the Super Bowl here, but I understand it was a big thing for folks around Chicago.
3874576	3877698	I know one of our lesbians is from the immediate area.
3878103	3880324	I was rooting for the Bears simply because I was hoping they'd make another music video.
3880364	3881025	Super Bowl shuffle?
3881065	3881685	Yes, exactly.
3881725	3884566	My favorite line from that is probably, now I'm as smooth as a chocolate swirl.
3884586	3888448	But you have to admit, and without getting too much further into sports, you have to admit that opening touchdown was hilarious.
3907810	3908230	Yeah, definitely.
3908250	3908691	Comedy Gold.
3908831	3910112	Alright, what's on your mind tonight, game-wise?
3910792	3915496	Well, basically, I have to talk about the whole ghost-saving thing with a memory pack.
3915596	3916757	Popular topic tonight, yes.
3916777	3917258	What's on your mind?
3918198	3922522	Well, I disagree that it has to do with hacking the game itself or altering the game itself in any way.
3922602	3926245	I think that the emulator could be programmed to emulate a control pack itself.
3929395	3944085	I suppose, I don't know, I guess maybe I'm just thinking, the reason why my brain goes there is I'm thinking maybe it's just simply the way the data is written, or you're talking about different types of memory, I don't know, my brain, for some reason I'm thinking in my mind, it has to be the game that's recoded.
3944305	3948308	I don't know, I wish Nintendo would be more open, but you know, they're not going to tell us the specifics.
3949128	3955472	Well, I just figured since every PC emulator has figured out a way to get around save data, it would only take a little bit of ingenuity to get around it on the Wii.
3955492	3955813	I suppose.
3955853	3956313	I suppose.
3956809	3961153	But unfortunately, the Wii is so locked down when it comes to hacking and all that stuff.
3961233	3963155	It's got to be Nintendo who does it.
3963175	3965177	I honestly don't think they care enough.
3965638	3968761	I think they just want to start cranking out more virtual console games for us to buy.
3968781	3973746	I think they want to get working on Pokemon Snap and whatever else on the 64 they're going to be bringing us.
3974507	3975808	Ocarina of Time, all that crap.
3976383	3978324	Yeah, it's not a big deal for ghost data.
3978364	3980385	I never used it in the N64 version anyway.
3980625	3984147	Yeah, I didn't have a memory pack, so it's kind of a moot point to me.
3984187	3990410	I'm like, oh, well, that's too bad I can't save ghost data, but then again, I'm barely playing this as it is because I have such bad gamer ADD.
3992031	3999295	The other thing I'd like to comment on, though, is since Final Fantasy VI comes out this week for the Game Boy Advance, I think that's a great thing.
3999955	4001056	I love Final Fantasy VI.
4001116	4002757	It's my favorite Final Fantasy game ever.
4003397	4004518	Terra's theme is...
4005182	4007123	Quite possibly my favorite piece of music from any game.
4007763	4011045	The opera is one of the best scenes in video games.
4011085	4013786	It could be the best.
4013906	4014307	Oh, I know.
4014347	4015467	I know it's a different thing.
4015487	4016568	I'm talking about a different part of the game.
4016808	4020370	But the opera scene is possibly the best scene in video game history, period.
4020390	4021210	Very fun.
4021350	4028454	And when I went to the More Friends concert a couple years ago before E3 and they reenacted that thing, like they had the actual opera singers, just chills.
4028534	4032536	Even though the rest of the concert had sound glitches galore, that part was phenomenal.
4032916	4033416	Phenomenal.
4035472	4037273	Why haven't we seen a remake of Chrono Trigger?
4039515	4041677	Didn't they touch it on the PlayStation 1 at least?
4041697	4043098	They did, Final Fantasy Chronicle.
4044199	4047622	You know, it's kind of like, why doesn't Nintendo do a new Kid Icarus?
4048283	4056130	It's kind of like, it squares little franchises that they're just kind of waiting for the right time on, I suppose, to really wow us.
4056350	4057351	But yeah, that is kind of interesting.
4057411	4059132	Why haven't we seen a Chrono Trigger type game on the DS?
4059212	4062215	I wonder if the other part of it isn't Toriyama's stake in it.
4063314	4063574	Maybe.
4063974	4071157	Toriyama is a really big name in art in Japan, so it could possibly be his own stake in it.
4071917	4074838	Yeah, but what other RPG could get me to care about an anthropomorphic frog?
4075978	4076198	True.
4077699	4079459	Maybe they'll add one in Final Fantasy VI.
4079479	4080839	Battletoads, hey.
4081500	4083520	What happened to Battletoads vs. Double Dragon?
4083540	4085101	Battletoads was too fucking hard.
4085141	4086181	Everyone gave up on it.
4087762	4091183	Yeah, it took me forever to get through, but I did actually beat that game, but that's a different story altogether.
4091543	4092363	That's all I had to say, so
4092819	4094160	So I'll leave you to the rest of the show.
4094300	4095000	No problem.
4095200	4097981	Thanks so much for your insight, Rob D. We've been enjoying your chat comments tonight.
4098601	4098862	Thank you.
4098982	4099682	All right, take care, buddy.
4100222	4100462	You too.
4100642	4100902	Later.
4101643	4104084	All right, let's go to another call right here on the line.
4104124	4105264	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4105284	4105704	Who's this?
4106104	4107445	This is Brad from PodCulture.
4107545	4109106	Hey, Brad from PodCulture.
4109126	4109826	How you doing, buddy?
4110586	4113187	I'm short and I'm fat and I'm going bald, but other than that, okay.
4114548	4116409	Well, real life sucks, but that's okay.
4116449	4117409	That's why we have the Internet.
4118810	4119590	What's on your mind, buddy?
4120222	4122184	Rob's not as bad as me.
4122584	4124927	I've got like ten people waiting at the queue.
4139464	4140065	That's no big thing.
4140085	4143067	I'm more interested in playing with the me's more than anything else.
4143227	4144527	I'll just send you my doctor.
4144728	4147109	I will send you the goat say me somebody made me.
4147149	4147890	It's disgusting.
4147930	4148410	It's brilliant.
4148470	4149151	Oh, Lord.
4149231	4151132	I have Michael Jackson and the doctor.
4151292	4153834	I think it was SSJ100 Matt made it.
4153874	4154994	It's a goat say me.
4155114	4155795	It's hilarious.
4156215	4157696	It's so wrong on so many levels.
4157716	4158236	But funny.
4159497	4161819	Anyway, what else is on your mind regarding the we?
4162307	4166208	Well, I got the Mario Kart 64, downloaded that today.
4166928	4174730	And not only that, the problem with the ghost data, I was having problems with plugging in my GameCube controller and using it.
4175590	4179051	Oh, because those games are optimized for the Wii Classic controller.
4179971	4181271	I haven't tried the GameCube controller.
4181291	4182371	What were the problems you were having?
4183532	4185352	It's like the A button wouldn't work.
4187533	4188613	And I know it's not the controller.
4188653	4189253	I played that...
4190754	4191335	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4210523	4212343	You don't like the Wii Classic controller?
4212843	4213023	No.
4213224	4214324	What is it about it you don't like?
4215124	4219705	I guess I'm being used to the Xbox controller or PlayStation.
4219745	4221185	It's just the way that it fits in the hands.
4221825	4222105	I see.
4222825	4228286	The thing that weirds me out about the controller is all the buttons on the top of it.
4228786	4233327	There's an L button, an R button, and then a little Z, and these other little nubs on it.
4233407	4234567	And there's too many buttons.
4235288	4237428	Is it me, or is the A and B buttons reversed?
4238001	4239802	from what they normally would be on the controller.
4239842	4245823	No, I think they're right, but sometimes if you play a lot of Japanese games, they're usually backwards, and so that can kind of mess with you.
4246303	4247804	It just seems like it's in a weird place.
4247964	4249084	Yeah.
4249144	4250345	And then what else was that?
4250465	4254686	Oh, Nintendo Maniac64 says a classic controller is needed for Super Nintendo games.
4255086	4257747	I'd agree with that, because the GameCube had that funky layout for the buttons.
4257907	4258507	I beg to differ.
4258987	4261808	You use the GameCube controller on Super Nintendo games?
4261928	4262548	The HoriPad.
4264571	4268652	Hori made a GameCube controller that was in the Super Nintendo.
4268992	4271372	Oh, so you're not really using a GameCube controller.
4271532	4271872	I get it.
4272072	4276193	But if you don't have a classic controller, you've still got another way to do it.
4276273	4278354	Okay, I didn't even think about a third-party GameCube controller.
4278374	4280374	And the fact that the Hori pads came out in the U.S.
4280454	4281274	at major retailers.
4281714	4282675	Oh, there you go.
4284595	4285715	Good insight, DarkSakura.
4285995	4286315	All right.
4287335	4289956	So what other games have you been playing on your Wii, Brad?
4289976	4290236	All right.
4290663	4292686	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4307046	4307326	You know what?
4307406	4310809	I'll go get you a Wii card if you promise me the first thing you download is R-Type.
4311309	4311709	Oh, sure.
4311729	4313630	You send me a Wii card, I'll download anything you want.
4313671	4317693	Just wait until after I make my next school payment.
4318734	4319094	Wow.
4319414	4320835	Look at this, guys.
4320895	4321636	Call in tonight.
4321656	4323897	Jamie's giving away free Wii points.
4324077	4325939	Only to my fellow Whovian.
4326379	4326739	All right.
4329421	4330221	It's like a contest.
4330262	4332323	Say something nice about Doctor Who win Wii points.
4333092	4335494	Send those emails to mailbag at orangefleshradio.com.
4335914	4339357	I will send Wii points to whoever gets me a David Tennant signature.
4340138	4340899	Oh, there you go.
4340979	4343101	Which, actually, I could just do that with an envelope, but still.
4343601	4344041	There you go.
4345263	4346924	Zappy in our chat says, I love Doctor Who.
4346944	4347164	Give me.
4347745	4348005	All right.
4348245	4349526	Brad, anything else on your mind tonight?
4350327	4352749	Yeah, the DOA movie actually doesn't suck.
4353309	4353690	Really?
4353770	4356012	See, all I've heard is really negative things about it.
4356712	4360856	Now, I know you reviewed it on your own program, but in a nutshell, what were your thoughts on it?
4361886	4363186	It's complete popcorn.
4364527	4370049	It's not, there's not a whole lot of, I mean, it's all substance, but are all... All style, no substance?
4370109	4370409	Yeah.
4370509	4370689	Yeah.
4371149	4375050	Well, I mean, it's a fun summer movie kind of thing.
4375110	4378151	I mean, it's just fun.
4378892	4388015	It's not... So, it's like, it's one of those movies where, like, turn your brain off for two hours and just kind of be a mindless zombie and it's not so bad?
4388675	4388955	Oh, yeah.
4389155	4389775	All right, that's cool.
4390015	4391496	Why do you think it bypassed theaters?
4392921	4398163	I really don't know because I've paid ten bucks to see movies that are ten times worse than that.
4399583	4400063	That's true.
4400123	4401644	I did pay to see Lady in the Water.
4403665	4410467	Did you have the life, or is it, I'm sorry, is it true in Dead or Alive movie that they have like life bars and the announcer in it?
4411387	4411607	Yeah.
4411827	4413828	Was that, that sounds cheesy.
4413908	4414548	Was it cheesy?
4415148	4417209	It's very cheesy in some places, yeah.
4418300	4425184	Oh well, I suppose you don't go see a Dead or Alive movie expecting Oscar caliber, Judi Dench acting in it type content.
4426044	4428726	Although it would be kind of funny if Judi Dench was in Dead or Alive, don't you think?
4431267	4431627	Forget it.
4431887	4432128	No.
4433288	4433868	Not funny.
4435129	4435529	Alright.
4436330	4440732	Well, yeah, I hope they go to your program and check out the full review of Dead or Alive.
4441453	4441753	Alright.
4442053	4443674	Alright, well Brad, thanks so much for calling in tonight.
4443694	4445515	We gotta go to another call, but take care buddy, okay?
4445975	4446535	Later on, man.
4446635	4446916	Later.
4447456	4447656	Peace.
4448735	4452036	Alright, little mini movie review here on Orange Launch Radio.
4452076	4453657	Let's go to one more call.
4453717	4454878	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4454918	4455318	Who's this?
4456558	4457919	Hey, Shadow Next Gen in chat.
4458139	4459540	Hi, Shadow Next Gen in chat.
4459580	4460280	What's on your mind, buddy?
4462821	4467263	I apologize if you guys talked about this earlier as I was late to the show because of the Super Bowl.
4467663	4470184	Alright, a lot of people have that excuse tonight, but try me.
4470224	4470525	What's up?
4471545	4478108	Do you guys have any idea about what Konami's quote-unquote earth-shattering news tomorrow is going to be?
4480296	4480717	You know what?
4480878	4486029	We didn't bring this up, but I had read somewhere that they have earth-shattering news coming on Monday.
4486050	4487373	It's on their own website.
4487393	4488615	They're advertising tomorrow.
4488676	4489598	Earth-shattering news.
4490314	4494895	and I saw that get picked up on Kotaku or Destructoid or one of those sites.
4495876	4497916	No, because they didn't tell us what it is on Thursday.
4497976	4506439	I can guarantee you, we talked earlier in the show about we weren't allowed to say some things for some time, but I can guarantee you everything that we were allowed to say has been said now.
4506459	4508019	Here's the earth-shattering news.
4508579	4511680	Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming soon.
4513061	4514001	I have a feeling.
4514511	4516852	It's probably about one of the games we didn't see.
4517032	4519132	Like, where was the Metal Gear Solid 4 info?
4519352	4520173	You know, maybe that's it.
4520253	4527995	Maybe it's the Metal Gear Solid release date because don't you remember her saying something like, well, we want to give you the release date, but can we do that yet?
4528235	4528395	No?
4528795	4530195	Like, didn't she kind of do that kind of thing?
4530615	4532336	Like, wasn't that how she was teasing the release date?
4532776	4533256	She's just...
4533962	4536324	or was she just smoking a bowl?
4536484	4542547	Doesn't she remind you just a little bit of what's-her-name from Nintendo, the Perrin Kaplan or whatever?
4542588	4542908	I don't know.
4542968	4549312	But anyway, I would say if it's that earth-shattering, it's the Metal Gear Solid 4 release date, new trailer, something like that.
4549652	4552054	Something that missed Konami Gamers Day for whatever reason.
4552914	4558077	Well, I know I was reading a lot of people are thinking it's maybe Konami's confirmation of MGS4 and the 360s.
4561718	4570387	I have a feeling if that's going to happen, it's going to be a window where it's going to be on the PS3 for six months, and then it'll come out on the 360.
4572287	4574389	It might be like Virtua Fighter and just be Blade.
4574829	4578432	Yeah, that's essentially what I'm getting at, is that it might be one of those things.
4578732	4582174	Because I'll tell you what, Sony needs that so bad right now.
4582655	4588019	And you can kind of tell that Konami's really back in the PSP more than almost anyone else.
4588459	4591121	Konami is doing what they can for Sony.
4591561	4596325	So, you know, they still are in the business of making money, but I have a feeling they're going to give at least a window.
4596805	4598687	I would not expect that to be tomorrow's news.
4599087	4599847	But I could be wrong.
4600088	4600648	That could be it.
4601028	4601769	I see what you did there.
4601789	4601909	Funny.
4630601	4632822	What do you hope it is, Shadow Next Gen?
4634443	4637424	Personally, like I said, I'd like to see Metal Gear on the 360.
4637865	4641366	That would probably be for me.
4641607	4643868	That way, one less reason for me to shell out $600.
4645949	4650151	Well, I know, yeah, it would be bad news for Sony if that is what they announce tomorrow.
4650771	4653152	Do you think Sony ought to just throw in the towel at that point?
4653252	4656234	Or what can Sony do if they're about to lose Metal Gear Solid to the 360?
4659427	4660647	I really couldn't tell you.
4660707	4664030	Well, for one thing, they can start listening to their community like Microsoft does.
4664630	4665251	Oh, good idea.
4665791	4670875	It seems like they keep telling us what we want instead of listening to what we want.
4671516	4672196	That is true.
4672276	4674758	They don't have anything quite like Major Nelson.
4675419	4676560	You've got to give that to Microsoft.
4676580	4680543	Microsoft is by no means perfect, but at least they do have their outlet with their community.
4680903	4684906	And you've got to admit, though, Nintendo kind of doesn't really listen to people either, but somehow they get away with it.
4685942	4689303	No, they don't, but I think they do a little bit better.
4689423	4691604	But yeah, they could do better in that area as well.
4691764	4698786	We seem to forgive Nintendo because they kind of at least deliver a little more than Sony seems to have been recently, I think is what it comes down to.
4699966	4705068	Well, I think, personally, I think the reason why Sony has gotten so much far over the past year is just their PR.
4705768	4709749	If they wouldn't have said half of their stupid comments, they'd probably be in a much better position right now.
4709949	4710709	I would agree with you there.
4712030	4715751	Like the time when people will buy a PS3 even if there are no games for it.
4716469	4717090	I guess that's true.
4717711	4722038	Alright, well, we will see what that announcement is and we'll talk about it next week.
4722098	4726605	So, Shadow Next Gen, I'm hoping you'll call us back next week and let us know about the news, whatever it is.
4727846	4728447	Yeah, alright.
4728507	4729048	Sounds good, guys.
4729168	4729930	Alright, take care, buddy.
4729950	4730350	Have a good one.
4731131	4731632	Yeah, you too.
4731873	4732133	Later.
4733291	4734832	That's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
4734852	4736493	Thank you so much to all our people calling in.
4736513	4738013	And I apologize if we didn't get to your call.
4738053	4739834	We were getting hammered a lot there towards the end.
4739874	4741775	But we just got to keep things moving.
4741815	4742876	We're running a little late tonight.
4742956	4747118	So we are going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show.
4747138	4748598	Are there any more last-minute stories, guys?
4748958	4749118	Yeah.
4749419	4749659	All right.
4749699	4750179	Yes, Loki.
4750719	4751079	A few things.
4752680	4754021	There's going to be a brand-new wipeout.
4754041	4754421	I know.
4754441	4755001	This is a surprise.
4755281	4757422	Brand-new wipeout coming to the PS3 and PSP.
4759649	4788973	and actually looks pretty good they have some screenshots up on that you know looks very similar to the other Wipeout games apparently Microsoft is bringing Project Silphid over here for Square Enix and they're going to be publishing it stateside so that's kind of cool I'm very much looking forward to that one so we'll see the next gen shooter on 360 soon rumors are that according to Famitsu Resident Evil 5 is delayed to 2008 I definitely believe that um
4790014	4796581	Let's see, another rumor here, and this apparently was actually coming from, I want to say Bungie.
4797162	4799785	Yeah, actually it was from their last Bungie update.
4799805	4804249	They were saying that you'll be able to modify the gravity in, I believe, multiplayer games.
4804790	4808434	So you can reduce the gravity to 50% and jump even further.
4808494	4811177	Hooray for low gravity games, you all know that's coming.
4812250	4814651	Can I give some quick chatroom comments to the last phone call here?
4815271	4818352	NM64 says, Sky, I think Nintendo surprised their fans.
4818492	4820092	Sony tells fans what they want.
4820552	4826134	TheRobD says, That's because Nintendo doesn't act like arrogant jerks and piss all over our memories when they don't listen to us.
4826794	4829575	Blackboy says, Nintendo totally doesn't listen to the consumers.
4830635	4831015	Let's see.
4831295	4834136	Hitstun says, Konami announces Boktai game for PS3.
4834556	4835076	Yeah!
4836156	4838037	You have to drag your PS3 out into the sun.
4839954	4845176	Bandit says, Breaking news, Konami's tears can cure cancer, if only it was able to cry.

4975896	4980400	They have the first screenshots for Flatout Ultimate Carnage on Xbox side.
4981815	4985617	So I thought you might want to check this out because it looks very similar to Burnout.
4985817	4987037	And it looks very good.
4987077	4988138	Wow, that's very pretty.
4988358	4990799	It's like Burnout, but you can launch your driver through the windshield.

5089210	5093794	I love their fries, the 400 calories for those tasty, beautiful potatoes.
5094334	5097277	I can just make them at home in the oven, and then they're like 200.
5098118	5098378	All right.
5098738	5100379	You can cut up a potato and put it in the oven.
5100780	5101420	Yeah, I could do that.
5101540	5102001	That's not bad.
