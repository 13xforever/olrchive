19440	23840	All right, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening.
23840	26120	We're taping live on February the 4th of 2007.
26120	31760	Hey, if you want to join us for a live taping sometime, it's Sunday nights, 6 o'clock pacific,
31760	32760	www.orangeloungeradio.com.
32760	37320	And yes, we know there's a big football game that just wrapped up and folks are probably
37320	40740	still at their parties, but here we are because we're loyal to the show.
40740	44120	We love you guys and we love all of you that are in chat right now, even though there is
44120	49460	still that football game, post-game stuff going on and whatever show is on after it
49460	51560	this year and all that stuff going on.
51560	54680	So thank you guys for being loyal and tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.
54680	56640	Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
56640	58440	Who's starting us off in the next segment here?
58440	68160	Well apparently there's news that Sony was basically saying, a spokesman from Sony, Dave,
68160	72620	his name sounds like Cracker, Craker, I guess.
72620	77700	He was quoted, they were talking about the whole, you know, format wars and stuff and
77700	82720	talking about, you know, PlayStation 3 versus 360 and stuff.
82720	86880	And then one of the things that they were talking about also was the Nintendo Wii and
86880	90160	saying that it wasn't even in the same category as PlayStation 3.
90160	95900	In fact, the Wii could be considered as an impulse buy more than anything else, which
95900	100320	everyone was like, oh my God, you know, that's so crazy that he would say that, but I don't
100320	103680	really think that's a, you know, okay, it is an impulse buy.
103680	106320	It's cheaper than, you know.
106320	109640	They're talking shit about the competition, oh noes, everybody does that.
109640	113960	They're calling you, at least people are buying it.
113960	115960	Impulse buy or not, huh?
115960	116960	Exactly.
116960	117960	All right.
117960	122120	All right, so what do you think, Dark Soccer, is the Wii an impulse buy, is this a fair
122120	123120	statement to make?
123120	126640	I mean, I guess I've known some casual gamers who after playing Wii Tennis are like, I've
126640	128120	got to get one of those.
128120	129120	Is the Wii an impulse buy?
129120	136080	Well, tell me what average person just happens to have, you know, 350 bucks lying around.
136080	142080	You know, usually we have things to pay, like bills, or that's a car payment, you know.
142080	144320	Well, somehow the three of us manage it.
144320	149440	Well, yeah, but we also, you know, if we were responsible about it, planned out that purchase,
149440	150440	right?
150440	154240	Right, and I did not budget a PlayStation 3, so I didn't buy them.
154240	158160	We budgeted our PlayStation 3, we budgeted our Wii.
158160	162080	I budgeted the Wii, but I did not budget a PlayStation 3, which is why I don't have one.
162080	165580	I had to have mine three days early, so.
165580	171480	And JV Mon in our chat room comes back with the classic, your mom is an impulse buy.
171480	174000	That was pretty funny.
174000	176000	That's why I said JV Mon.
176000	177160	Last night!
177160	182520	Anyhow, and the Rob D says, that's what happens when it's at a lower price than $599 US dollars.
182520	183520	It's a little easier to be in.
183520	186200	And it has more than 15 games.
186200	192480	Well, I wouldn't go as far as to call it an impulse buy, but it is something that's easier
192480	193480	to budget in.
193480	198960	Okay, but be honest, though, and this is only fair, since, you know, we rip on Sony a lot,
198960	205480	let me give it, you know, be fair here, uh, Nintendo, Wii, what's up with the Wii Connect
205480	206480	24 thing?
206480	211640	Because it obviously is not updating my firmware, it's not downloading new content for me, all
211640	214960	it's doing is sending me messages that I can download some more content.
214960	217560	Fucking, where is this automatic downloading shit?
217560	222320	It's there for the purpose of illuminating your living room in a blue glow.
222320	227000	Nintendo does not like to come out swinging with their stuff, haven't you noticed this
227000	228000	about them?
228000	231240	They don't like to reveal all the secrets of their consoles, like look at what happened
231240	232240	with the DS.
232240	235260	No one knew that thing would have voice thing over the internet or even have internet play
235260	236260	at all.
236260	239320	I mean, it was kind of hinted at, but never was that announced.
239320	242920	But Nintendo, for whatever reason, chooses to roll this out slowly.
242920	245200	Xbox 360, they come out swinging.
245200	250120	They lay their cock out on the table and say, thwack, here you go, it's all right here.
250120	254600	I mean, that's really a fundamental difference between like Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo
254600	256400	is the way they kind of...
256400	259400	Even Sony, their online network, there's nothing on there!
259400	261400	Give me something to buy!
261400	262400	Landings?
262400	264400	Gran Turismo?
264400	268800	Gran Turismo's free, okay, but there's still nothing to buy in there, there's no new demos.
268800	273080	There's PSP download games, that's completely useless, make the PSP download that shit!
273080	276240	Why do I have to have a PlayStation 3 to download this crap?
276240	282240	I mean, the PSP is capable of downloading this stuff too, you know, off the internet,
282240	285520	or if it's going to take too long to do that, download it on your PC!
285520	286720	That should be able to be done.
286720	291680	I mean, you'd probably sell some more of those virtual, you know, those emulated PlayStation
291680	295600	1 games if you did it that way, instead of having this stuff clutter the PlayStation
295600	301240	store, because there's nothing on there right now, and one game a month is bullshit, because
301240	304400	their games aren't that great to begin with.
304400	308920	I don't know, it's just really disappointing, at least fucking Xbox Live gets it, you know,
308920	312720	there's more stuff on there every week, you know, whether it be crap or not, at least
312720	317200	there's fucking demos on there, I can say, you know, oh, new demos, can't say the same
317200	320640	about PlayStation 3, I can certainly not say the same about the Wii, because there's nothing
320640	321640	on there!
321640	322640	Nothing!
322640	324560	And only one game- Old games?
324560	328400	One game supports Wii Connect 24, and that's Elibits, and to be honest, I haven't gotten
328400	330260	shit from Elibits, you know, on the Wii Connect 24.
330260	333680	Would you like me to send you an Elibit picture, for use in Elibits?
333680	336040	I can do this for you, so you'll stop being such a bitch.
336040	337040	No, I don't.
337040	341200	But, the whole thing, it's just, you know, I thought that this would eliminate the fact
341200	345040	of me having to wait to download these updates, or, you know, whatever, it's just, they're
345040	347600	not using this shit.
347600	353800	Going back to a very dirty comment I made earlier, Rama says, Xbox 360's cock puts a
353800	355800	consumer's eye out.
355800	358200	DarkTetsUya says, Rob just likes to say cock.
358200	359200	Who doesn't?
359200	360200	Who doesn't?
360200	361200	Do you like to say other things?
361200	363880	I like to say all dirty words, I like to say all types of dirty words.
363880	364880	Who doesn't?
364880	372400	Well, even though we saw that Sony was being cocky in that last story, get it?
372400	375920	We have Nintendo accepting an award.
375920	382080	The Wii and WarioWare won an International Toy Fair award, that's pretty cool, except
382080	387600	when they said WarioWare won, they spelled it W-E-A-R.
387600	393200	Well anyway, they won this International Toy Fair award, and they chose the Wii because,
393200	398280	quote, encourages playing PC games in groups instead of alone, even though it's not really
398280	399280	a PC game.
399280	400840	Well, that's a whole other story.
400840	405120	Also, quote, the product not only appeals to player types with an affinity to PCs, but
405120	411640	also to new age groups, making it sound like I'm going to, like, you know, take herbs.
411640	414720	They're talking out of their ass.
414720	418960	I think it's just these folks, you know, they don't really deal with gaming every day, so
418960	424760	it's, you know, they're used to giving awards to, like, Tickle Me Elmo, so I think that's
424760	429720	kind of the, what makes this newsworthy is that the Wii has kind of jumped that boundary
429720	435600	as becoming recognition as a toy, in general, and not just a gaming system.
435600	438040	Kind of interesting, I don't know.
438040	442720	I still don't think they get it, but I think this is pretty cool information, though.
442720	447640	Atari Europe is announcing a Godzilla game for the Wii.
447640	452400	And I'm sorry for the Wii, the DS, and the PSP.
452400	458280	It's called Godzilla Unleashed, and it's supposed to be a non-linear game featuring everybody's
458280	461760	favorite big green lizard, which, by the way, Godzilla is female.
461760	465400	Stop saying that she's a he.
465400	470880	So basically, you go around bashing stuff, kicking it, clawing it, stomping it, throwing
470880	476080	poo at it, I don't know, but you go through major cities worldwide and are aiming for
476080	478440	the title of king of all monsters.
478440	480880	She'd be queen, Godzilla's female.
480880	481880	She laid eggs.
481880	482880	Sorry.
482880	491000	Anyway, but it's a game that you basically work the storyline as you progress.
491000	497040	I think that's pretty cool, very dynamic, especially given that you're using the Wii
497040	498040	controller for it.
498040	502160	Well, I'm glad to see rampages coming out over there.
502160	509800	That was another thought I had, but I'm hoping that we get, like, Mothra and, you know, Gamera.
509800	515120	I'm glad to learn that we will have an accurate reenactment of a woman during her time of
515120	518360	the month on a console.
518360	519360	You see these bills?
519360	520360	Yes.
520360	521360	Ow.
521360	525420	It does explain why she constantly, you know, probably doesn't know where she's at because
525420	529560	she does it in bad directions, you know, oh, I fucking thought this was, like, the middle
529560	531120	of the ocean, but shit, it's Japan.
531120	532560	Well, goddammit, I'm pissed now.
532560	534520	I'm going to blow things up with fire.
534520	538800	Actually, no, I think the second Godzilla is male.
538800	541880	I would be shocked if Jamie comes back next week.
541880	546880	Of course, someone's got to keep us in line, yes, Jamie?
546880	547880	Am I getting the finger?
547880	548880	Oh.
548880	549880	No, Matt was getting the finger.
549880	551760	Usually when it's silent, I'm getting the finger.
551760	556160	Wouldn't moths like to fly up in the space and fly into the sun because moths are, you
556160	557160	know, attracted to fire?
557160	558160	Moths are stupid.
558160	562960	That's a dumb, why the hell would they create a moth, you know, monster anyways?
562960	565200	That's the dumbest thing ever.
565200	569400	But, but, but, but, but Gamera was cool.
569400	570800	Gamera is really neat.
570800	571800	Flying turtle.
571800	575320	The last time I played a Godzilla game was the old ass NES game that they had with you.
575320	577160	Super NES game was fucking awesome.
577160	578160	And I played...
578160	579160	Or was it NES?
579160	580160	I don't remember.
580160	583840	It was a King of Monsters game, which wasn't really Godzilla, but pretty much.
583840	584840	On NEOGEO.
584840	585840	NEOGEO.
585840	586840	Anyway.
586840	587840	Alright, forget it.
587840	594880	So, what's kind of interesting though, and this is, I guess, you know, your random Nintendo
594880	596680	game sighting.
596680	601720	They have an easter egg in their DS dictionary thing, because we don't get any actual non-games
601720	602720	over here.
602720	613080	Apparently, if you look up the word for ball, you can actually find, it says one of two
613080	615520	translations in the dictionary.
615520	616520	One of them that's grayed out.
616520	621680	If you click on the grayed out one, it brings up the Game & Watch game, Ball.
621680	625680	So you get to play that kind of little easter egg that's thrown in there.
625680	626680	And it was for them.
626680	627680	Oh, hooray.
627680	628680	I love Ball.
628680	632360	I love Mr. Game & Watch.
632360	634080	I don't know.
634080	638560	Well, something else a lot of us love and can't wait to see a new version of this is
638560	640200	Punch Out!
640200	648840	And according to gonintendo.com, Punch Out! might be coming to the Wii pretty soon here.
648840	653600	Now of course, a lot of these rumors come from patents and trademark offices, and that's
653600	656560	where Go Nintendo is getting their idea from.
656560	661080	Nintendo filed a Punch Out! trademark again in April of 2005, and it was recently updated
661080	662680	on January 11th.
662680	666320	Now who knows if they're just kind of holding on to it, just making sure no one else tries
666320	668340	to take the name or whatever they're doing.
668340	674080	But certainly when you look at something like Wii Boxing, you can't help but go, it's just
674080	678080	a matter of time before this comes out on, you know, Punch Out! on the Wii.
678080	682320	It's too bad it won't be Mike Tyson's Punch Out! though.
682320	688080	That would be Mike Tyson's Ear Fest.
688080	692040	Mike Tyson's... never mind, I'm gonna make a really bad joke here, let's move on before
692040	695600	I get myself in trouble.
695600	696600	You know...
696600	700780	I just wanted to say I really love this game, I love the Nintendo Wii.
700780	704600	I'm sure his Wii, uh... never mind.
704600	706760	Also I love fighting off ears and rape!
706760	711440	Now this should make a lot of people very, very happy.
711440	719640	Tyson's favorite luchador, Strong Bad, is on the Wii, kinda.
719640	731240	The uh, our favorite developer, Vid-uh, Vid-electrics, has created Vid-electrics, which is a collection
731240	737400	of some of their games that are remastered for Wii control.
737400	741340	And uh, the quote says, the guys at Vid-electrics have reworked a few of your favorite games
741340	745640	for use on your favorite wave around controller game system.
745640	747440	I think that is great.
747440	757400	You have uh, Strong Bad Zone, Secret Collect, Kid Speedy, um, More to Come, Population Tire,
757400	759520	and More to Come.
759520	768240	You can um, you basically go to your Wii browser to um, the uh, I guess, it's the Vid-electrics
768240	782200	page that of course is, you know, associated with HomestarRunner.com, um, but it's Vid-e-l-e-c-t-r-i-x-dot-com-slash-v-i-i-v.
782200	785600	You know, I predicted a while ago HomestarRunner was gonna jump the shark and sell out to like
785600	787500	Cartoon Network, but I guess I've been wrong.
787500	791000	They uh, still have been uh, just kind of trucking along with their web following there.
791000	795320	But now it's interesting to kind of see them tiptoeing into the console games a little
795320	796320	bit, you know.
796320	800600	I actually think it's pretty great that this started off as, you know, kind of not that
800600	806640	great books for children, and it just turned into this big internet phenomenon.
806640	809480	It just goes to show that good things come to those who wait, right?
809480	812720	We need A Peasant's Tale the game on Wii.
812720	816200	So since we've been doing this show five years now, just about, we should be getting those
816200	818160	rewards anytime soon now, huh?
818160	819160	Right?
819160	820160	Yeah?
820160	821160	That was funny.
821160	823160	We'll just be right here waiting for you.
823160	824760	La la la la la.
824760	832080	Anyways, other things you can do with your Wii, of course, non-Kozer things like modding
832080	833080	it.
833080	839120	In fact, there have been three teams that have been releasing their announcements for
839120	840440	Wii mod chips.
840440	846800	So before not, we're going to have backups and region-free Wiis, which is always good.
846800	850260	Well, the region-free part, at least.
850260	855040	One of these teams, Team Cyclops, they announced their Wii mod chip, which is supposed to be
855040	862000	able to play backups of both Wii and GameCube games, GameCube homebrew, imports of GameCube
862000	871080	games, and as well as DVD-R and support, and you're supposed to be able to have it as stealth
871080	872420	as well.
872420	877440	One other one that's actually supposed to be coming out pretty soon, it's called the
877440	883200	Wii Key, and that one's also going to be able to be updated via DVD, so it's supposed to
883200	887920	be future-proof, much like PlayStation 3, and it's supposed to be able to play backups
887920	893840	of both Wii and GameCube games, different region GameCube games and backups, multi-disc
893840	896600	games, and etc.
896600	902800	So this one's actually supposed to start shipping on February 7th, so maybe we'll find out a
902800	904400	little bit more of this next week.
904400	905400	Interesting.
905400	908440	Are you going to order one?
908440	911040	I don't know how to solder for shit, so probably not.
911040	914020	I thought you used to do that.
914020	917120	If you've seen any of my solder jobs, they're awful.
917120	921840	You know somebody who has a very expensive soldering iron who has experience with doing
921840	924280	these types of things now?
924280	925480	You?
925480	926480	My hubby.
926480	927920	Oh, yeah, from the pinball stuff.
927920	930640	He fixes his own pinball machines and has put together his main cabinet.
930640	932560	Let's get him to mod your Wii, maybe.
932560	933560	All right.
933560	936600	Well, anyhow, one thing that you can do on the Wii, of course, is play old games, which
936600	940280	is funny because most people want to hack them to install emulators on them, but the
940280	941280	Wii has one built in.
941280	944760	But the emulators are not perfect, as folks are finding out this week and downloading
944760	949640	Mario Kart 64 because you cannot save ghost data in Mario Kart 64.
949640	950640	Guess what?
950640	955280	Nintendo says, quote, due to unavoidable technical reasons, unfortunately it is not possible
955280	961760	to save ghost data for Mario 64's time trials in the virtual console version of the game.
961760	965760	They did place messages advising users about this before they download the game when the
965760	969880	Wii Shop channel is first accessed and in the more details tab on the individual game
969880	970880	page.
970880	971880	That's true.
971880	976200	The manual, they're in big red letters, you can't save ghost data.
976200	979200	I honestly think people are making too big a deal out of this.
979200	986040	I didn't have a memory pack when I owned Mario Kart 64, so I never had ghost data anyway.
986040	989560	How many people had a Nintendo 64, let alone the memory pack?
989560	993560	Of course, I know that's just opening up for the chat to start going, me, me, me, me, me,
993560	997160	but honestly, I don't think this is as huge of a loss.
997160	1003600	What I suppose where people are getting frustrated is that the Wii has this giant storage built
1003600	1004600	into it.
1004600	1009640	Why can't the emulator be smart enough to just save to the Wii thing?
1009640	1011880	Like virtual memory cards on the PlayStation 3.
1011880	1018960	But you'd be talking about going in and editing Mario Kart 64's game information to do that
1018960	1021720	because it would be talking about accessing data a whole other way.
1021720	1024600	You'd have to rewrite the game or recompile the game.
1024600	1030400	Perhaps they could patch it with, I don't know, Wii Connect 24 that they're not using?
1030400	1031400	They're not going to do it.
1031400	1032400	Nintendo says they're not going to do it.
1032400	1036840	The PC emulators, though, always saved the information.
1036840	1042360	The ROMs themselves actually have the emulator built into it when you're downloading it,
1042360	1044520	so it wouldn't be that hard for them to fix that.
1044520	1047800	All they have to do is edit the emulator.
1047800	1048800	But no.
1048800	1049880	Yeah, why should they?
1049880	1052280	Because no one really cares about that shit anyways.
1052280	1054600	Well, Legend of Zaku agrees and says, ghost data?
1054600	1055600	Who the fuck uses that?
1055600	1059440	And that's probably followed up by Boco Fett saying, I love ghost mode.
1059440	1062000	And Rob D seems to agree they could include a patch with the game.
1062000	1065760	This is all coming from our chatroom chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
1065760	1069720	Hitstun says, oh, come on, you can't emulate a friggin' controller pack?
1069720	1074280	I think it just might be in the way that the original system talked to the hardware.
1074280	1076920	I don't know if it's as easy as folks think it is.
1076920	1077920	Well, just like they were talking about doing it later on.
1077920	1079880	If it was that easy, Nintendo would have done it.
1079880	1080880	Rumble later on.
1080880	1081880	Maybe through an add-on?
1081880	1082880	Yeah.
1082880	1083880	Well, how about multiplayer online?
1083880	1087640	I think all of us would forgive Nintendo for the stupid ghost thing if we could do some
1087640	1088640	multiplayer online.
1088640	1089640	Wouldn't that be pretty awesome?
1089640	1091520	Oh, that would be fuckin' awesome.
1091520	1094400	In the real world, however.
1094400	1099040	And M64 says, Skya, I think you only download the emulator once per system.
1099040	1100520	Not sure on the specifics of that, possibly.
1100520	1101520	Who knows?
1101520	1104120	But you see, the thing, though, is once you purchase a game, you can delete it and redownload
1104120	1105120	it again.
1105120	1108600	So if that's the case, they could say, OK, there's an update to this game, please redownload
1108600	1109600	it.
1109600	1110600	And boom.
1110600	1111600	Done.
1111600	1113000	And you're supposed to do all that automatically.
1113000	1114000	Right.
1114000	1118000	ReConnect24 is a service that they sell, but don't actually fuckin' use.
1118000	1119000	So what's the point?
1119000	1120000	But that's not a surprise.
1120000	1121800	They did the same thing on the DS.
1121800	1122800	Same thing.
1122800	1123800	Anyhow.
1123800	1126200	Yeah, I know.
1126200	1127200	Let's move on.
1127200	1128840	Let's get some more user feedback.
1128840	1133280	And one way we invite you guys, the listeners, to come on and be a part of the program, because
1133280	1134280	it's not just us.
1134280	1136560	I mean, you know, this is your show, too.
1136560	1141040	And one way you can participate is by sending us an email to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1141040	1145880	Every week, DarkSakura opens up the email bag and dives in and grabs a few of her favorite
1145880	1147800	letters, and reads them here on air.
1147800	1149800	It's the Mailbag segment.
1149800	1151280	Slim Pickens this week, though, right, DarkSakura?
1151280	1152280	Not a lot of emails?
1152280	1154280	Well, we got a bunch of big fat ones.
1154280	1155280	Oh, there you go.
1155280	1156280	We like long letters.
1156280	1158560	Well, one of the emails comes from GS191.
1158560	1165400	However, I'm not reading the part about Jennifer Strange, because honestly, I'm sick of it.
1165400	1168800	Although we appreciate the feedback, I think we're all trying to move on from that whole
1168800	1169800	thing.
1169800	1170800	But thank you for your insight.
1170800	1171800	Thank you for being on the Internet.
1171800	1173760	You know, and as you find us, financial assessment and your very own name is, you know, what
1173760	1174740	we're thinking, and we...
1174740	1175740	Anyway.
1175740	1176600	Oh, there's also the disclaimer that...
1176600	1180680	Just because Loki wasn't on a mic Loki said we just can't continue to drown ourselves
1180680	1181680	in that information.
1181680	1182680	Arr!
1182680	1184340	It smells like meat in here.
1184340	1186320	Because he's eating a hamburger and he left the cart open.
1186320	1187480	Which you know what that means.
1187480	1188780	French fries stealing.
1188780	1189880	Fries stealing!
1189880	1190880	O shit.
1190880	1192600	Okay, an Ebony.
1192600	1193600	Sorry.
1193600	1195720	I need an eat em.
1195720	1197060	Oh no, I need an wiener.
1197060	1198600	Talk with your mouth full.
1198600	1199600	Okay.
1199600	1206600	I don't know what I read in the email.
1209600	1212600	Okay, now the Frapper map, the bane of my existence.
1212600	1215600	Can I smell fries in my mouth?
1215600	1217600	I really don't know what to do.
1217600	1220600	Give me more fries, give me more fries.
1220600	1222600	These are good fries.
1222600	1224600	They're elephant bar, they're pretty good.
1224600	1226600	That one was too salty though.
1226600	1231600	I really don't know what to do anymore about the Frapper map.
1231600	1234600	Ever since the switch from Google Maps to Yahoo Maps,
1234600	1237600	the performance of the website has gone down a lot.
1237600	1243600	I really screwed up the editing and refer to the point that you can go to your forums,
1243600	1248600	you can do that, but it takes out the shout out listings on the Frapper page.
1248600	1252600	So you're forced to use their forums if you want to see shout outs on the page.
1252600	1255600	Or if you use your own forums, take it automatically.
1255600	1258600	It takes the shout outs off the page.
1258600	1262600	Being the administrator of the Frapper map, I'm at a fork in the road.
1262600	1265600	There are many times that I was so discontent with the map
1265600	1268600	that I almost leave the map and start over again.
1268600	1273600	The one good thing is that there is an embedded HTML option when I customize the map,
1273600	1276600	so that gives me some hope on getting this to where I like it,
1276600	1279600	and hopefully everyone else does too.
1279600	1282600	Currently the map has 141 members,
1282600	1285600	but I know that there is a much larger community out there.
1285600	1288600	With more support, it will motivate me further, hopefully.
1288600	1291600	So as of now, I will keep it up, but if the Frapper screws up again,
1291600	1293600	I just don't know what to do.
1293600	1296600	We'll try to support the Frapper map, and I will do my best to maintain it.
1296600	1297600	Thank you.
1297600	1298600	Look at our Frapper map. It's pretty nice.
1298600	1299600	I have it up on the screen here.
1299600	1302600	If you want to see it, it's frapper.com slash orange lounge radio.
1302600	1307600	There's really nothing to this besides just the fact it's kind of cool to see where our listeners are.
1307600	1310600	You notice we have a lot scattered throughout the U.S.,
1310600	1314600	but what I'm really noticing a lack of is the pins over in the U.K.
1314600	1315600	Look at that.
1315600	1316600	There's like three pins over there.
1316600	1317600	Come on.
1317600	1318600	I know we've got more listeners than that over there,
1318600	1323600	and then look, Australia, if I go over to Australia, there's like a pin.
1323600	1326600	So we want to especially, not that we love our U.S. listeners,
1326600	1330600	we want to really see some of our international listeners put a pin in the map somewhere,
1330600	1333600	but I am going to steal what they do at All Games Interactive.
1333600	1334600	I am going to replace what's over here.
1334600	1336600	We're going to put a big map up here,
1336600	1341600	and we're going to put pins in whenever we get calls and the e-mails from different parts of the world.
1341600	1343600	We'll have one color for calls and one color for e-mails.
1343600	1345600	So we're going to start our own real-life Frapper.
1345600	1349600	But in the meantime, the online one will have to do frapper.com slash orange lounge radio.
1349600	1353600	That was a fan-created thing, so thank you to this e-mailer who created it.
1353600	1355600	Hugs and kisses.
1355600	1356600	Well, next e-mail.
1356600	1357600	Hi, guys.
1357600	1358600	DDR Dollar Bill here.
1358600	1360600	Hoping your days are going well for you guys.
1360600	1363600	Thanks for the updates from Konami Gamer's Day,
1363600	1366600	which now made my picking of the newest system very difficult.
1366600	1367600	This is why.
1367600	1371600	This weekend I was in the Chinatown section here in New York,
1371600	1375600	and while browsing through the anime picked up three series I haven't seen yet,
1375600	1378600	I was also checking out the imports and had some thoughts.
1378600	1380600	In the past, in order to play imported games,
1380600	1383600	the systems would need to be modified in some fashion.
1383600	1388600	I can recall back in the cartridge systems where you'd have to buy an adapter to play these games
1388600	1392600	or actually just break open your Super Nintendo and pull stuff out.
1392600	1395600	Super Nintendo one was funny.
1395600	1400600	Or having your CD DVD-based systems modified with a mod chip or swap desk or a paper clip.
1400600	1403600	Sorry.
1403600	1406600	I know that the Game Boy DS systems did not need any modification,
1406600	1408600	which is probably why I enjoyed them the most.
1408600	1410600	My question is this.
1410600	1414600	For the systems I did not list that are current are the following true.
1414600	1416600	Xbox 360 region locked.
1416600	1418600	No safe mod exists.
1418600	1420600	Safe as in you will not be banned from Xbox Live.
1420600	1422600	Wii region locked. No mod exists yet.
1422600	1424600	PS3 not region locked on PS3 games.
1424600	1426600	Region locked on PS2 games.
1426600	1428600	PSP not region locked.
1428600	1433600	I'm asking this because I'm going to be getting back into purchasing import titles,
1433600	1435600	not just the Bemani stuff,
1435600	1438600	but also some of their wrestling games,
1438600	1443600	which has been more original and fun than the Smackdown vs. Raw,
1443600	1449600	and other little oddities such as D.O.N. DBZ vs. One Piece vs. Naruto.
1449600	1452600	I don't care about playing backup copies, honestly,
1452600	1456600	and I don't want to get one system of each,
1456600	1458600	as that would be a waste of money.
1458600	1461600	I wish they would just let everyone pick and choose what to play,
1461600	1463600	regardless of where it's coming from.
1463600	1466600	Anywho, I could go on for another hour, but I'll leave it like that.
1466600	1469600	See you guys in the chat room tonight.
1469600	1471600	PS, I miss freestyle sometimes.
1471600	1474600	I do believe the PlayStation 3 regions for the game.
1474600	1476600	At least Blu-Ray.
1476600	1479600	One is both Japan and the United States.
1479600	1483600	When we talk about importing Japanese games, I think that works.
1483600	1485600	At least I don't know about the movies that might work,
1485600	1487600	but the games I'm not sure.
1487600	1490600	Once again, you probably just need to check maybe with import sites
1490600	1493600	to deal with that kind of stuff, whether that will work or not.
1493600	1495600	360 I know doesn't.
1495600	1497600	I'm going to be in San Francisco this weekend,
1497600	1500600	so if I go by Mikado I can ask them there since they keep up with all that.
1500600	1503600	I know they were saying that it is and it isn't,
1503600	1505600	but I know it's not region free,
1505600	1509600	but I think that we're in the same region as Japan now.
1509600	1511600	Interesting.
1511600	1514600	That makes sense because we're both NTSC.
1514600	1518600	Not that it's going to matter for anything in a high definition format,
1518600	1520600	but I can sort of see it.
1520600	1522600	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says,
1522600	1524600	You can use the GameCube freeloader on the Wii.
1524600	1526600	Positive. I've seen it done.
1526600	1527600	I have a freeloader.
1527600	1529600	But that's only for GameCube games.
1529600	1531600	That's not for Wii games.
1531600	1533600	I'm still going to check it out though.
1533600	1535600	I want to try it for myself.
1535600	1537600	But that's pretty cool.
1537600	1540600	It's really only a matter of time though
1540600	1543600	before anything that is region locked will be unlocked.
1543600	1546600	I am one of those people who said,
1546600	1550600	I'm not modding my PS2 and went out and bought a JPS2.
1550600	1552600	Ditto. I did it too.
1552600	1555600	PlayStation 2 Japanese games do not work on a US PlayStation 2.
1555600	1557600	Or a PlayStation 3.
1557600	1559600	I know somebody in chat,
1559600	1562600	I think Black Boy says PS2 Japanese games work on PlayStation 3,
1562600	1565600	but actually one of the sites had video of trying Kingdom Hearts 2,
1565600	1567600	the import on PlayStation 3,
1567600	1569600	and it came up with an error message.
1569600	1571600	So I'm not sure if that's true.
1571600	1576600	One thing though that I am curious about though is the freeloader.
1576600	1579600	If they're going to have...
1579600	1581600	Well, not the freeloader,
1581600	1584600	but what was the one for PlayStation hard drive?
1584600	1586600	HD loader?
1586600	1588600	HD loader. That was it.
1588600	1590600	If they're going to be coming up with something like that.
1590600	1592600	But it's still out there for the PlayStation 2.
1592600	1596600	If you can find the old style one or even the new style one,
1596600	1600600	you can download the HD loader that actually fits on your memory card.
1600600	1603600	And then you just plug in a USB drive.
1603600	1606600	Or USB hard drive or something like that.
1606600	1609600	And it works great for imports.
1609600	1612600	Well, they even have the thing where you can...
1612600	1613600	I guess it's the same thing.
1613600	1619600	You download it directly to your hard drive on the system.
1619600	1623600	I mean, not that we're condoning that eye roll,
1623600	1627600	but I wonder if they're going to have something like that for PS3
1627600	1629600	and then that makes the importing...
1629600	1632600	Or you remember back in the days with the GameCube
1632600	1636600	how they had the whole GD-ROM rip through the VMU unit.
1636600	1637600	Remember that?
1637600	1640600	I wonder if they'd be doing something along those lines too.
1640600	1643600	Just to clarify, it looks like I understand where I misunderstood.
1643600	1644600	Black Boy said,
1644600	1647600	I've played Japanese PlayStation 2 games on the Japanese PlayStation 3.
1647600	1651600	Well, yeah, that'll work. I thought he meant Japanese PlayStation 2 to US PlayStation 3.
1651600	1652600	And that's what the video was of.
1652600	1653600	So, oops.
1653600	1654600	Okay.
1654600	1655600	Next email.
1655600	1658600	And this comes from Neki, our friend.
1658600	1660600	Hi, Neki.
1660600	1662600	Heya, O-L-R.
1662600	1666600	Didn't get around to emailing last week, but I got some stuff today.
1666600	1668600	This is my second time typing this.
1668600	1671600	Since the first one screwed up, I hope it doesn't happen again.
1671600	1673600	Check out attachment one.
1673600	1676600	Okay, I didn't actually see there was attachments with this one.
1676600	1680600	It will show the Wii with over 4 million sales,
1680600	1682600	the 360 with 10 million,
1682600	1686600	and the PS3 with the tiny 1 million owned.
1686600	1690600	I would just like to give a big shout out towards my home forum site,
1690600	1693600	dscommunity.co.uk.
1693600	1695600	It's nice and fun, so everyone join the forums.
1695600	1697600	There's your free shout out.
1697600	1700600	Oh, yeah, and by the way, we are doing a DS tournament on Wednesday
1700600	1705600	starting from, it looks like July 2nd this year
1705600	1708600	at about 7 to 12 p.m. GMT.
1708600	1711600	Everyone is welcome, but it would be a good idea to join the forums first
1711600	1713600	plus we got chat.
1713600	1715600	Anyway, there's your free plug.
1715600	1717600	Free plug.
1717600	1719600	Did they plug us on their forums?
1719600	1721600	That's what I want to know.
1721600	1724600	Plug us on your forums now because we're awesome.
1724600	1726600	Yes, fries. Rock.
1726600	1730600	And so a question for me is where it got the music.
1730600	1732600	Dude, fries.
1732600	1733600	I'm not like hungry.
1733600	1735600	I haven't eaten since there's pancakes today.
1735600	1736600	Gave me an email.
1736600	1738600	Okay, sorry.
1738600	1741600	Sorry, necky.
1741600	1744600	A question for me was where did they get the music for the show.
1744600	1750600	I really went about the FUs of the Week,
1750600	1754600	your website of the week and the show's ending music.
1754600	1758600	The FUs of the Week music is actually from the Final Fantasy VII
1758600	1760600	Advent Children movie.
1760600	1762600	It's the one wing angel.
1762600	1770600	The big final battle in that movie, yep.
1770600	1773600	The website of the week music, isn't that Journey to Wonderland?
1773600	1775600	No, that's the mailbag music.
1775600	1776600	It's Journey to Wonderland.
1776600	1779600	Website of the Week is from DDR Ohastas.
1779600	1780600	That's right.
1780600	1781600	It's candy.
1781600	1787600	You can actually dance to that in the Japanese version of DDR.
1787600	1788600	I've done it.
1788600	1789600	It's awesome.
1789600	1793600	The first is the Ohastasian kids version.
1793600	1795600	It's kind of cute.
1795600	1799600	What was the Ohaska?
1799600	1801600	It's got a lot of cute songs in it.
1801600	1802600	It's fun.
1802600	1805600	And our ending show music, Rob knows that one because it's from Beatmania.
1805600	1809600	It's Akira Yamaoka, iFuturist.
1809600	1812600	Also in DDR Supernova, I believe.
1812600	1813600	Yep.
1813600	1816600	The godly and studly Akira Yamaoka who produces Silent Hill now as well.
1816600	1820600	I was actually watching the making of Silent Hill 3 and he was in it and he sounded really hoarse.
1820600	1821600	He's such a rock star.
1821600	1823600	I met him once like three years ago.
1823600	1824600	He was awesome.
1824600	1825600	I like his business cards.
1825600	1828600	Anyway, can't think of anything else.
1828600	1829600	Thanks for the podcast.
1829600	1830600	Really enjoy it.
1830600	1831600	Keep it up, Nike.
1831600	1834600	P.S. I found a Dr. Who thing you might get very excited about.
1834600	1836600	Haven't read it all as it's long.
1836600	1838600	Dr. Who the game?
1838600	1839600	Huh.
1839600	1841600	Why don't we talk about something like that?
1841600	1842600	Oh my god.
1842600	1843600	Huh.
1843600	1846600	It looks like they're going to be doing a Dr. Who game.
1846600	1848600	That's not a big surprise.
1848600	1851600	That makes me a happy fangirl.
1851600	1852600	Alright.
1852600	1857600	Oh, they're showing some of the old games though like the PC Dalek games anyway.
1857600	1860600	Anyway, that's for me later.
1860600	1861600	Anything else?
1861600	1862600	Yes.
1862600	1863600	Oh, sorry.
1863600	1864600	Hi.
1864600	1865600	This is from Bandit.
1865600	1866600	Hi guys.
1866600	1867600	How's it going?
1867600	1871600	Been listening to the show for a while and decided to send in an email for a change.
1871600	1875600	I just wanted to stop and voice an opinion that I've had for a while about moving to
1875600	1876600	the next gen.
1876600	1881600	Sure, when you look at the shiny new hardware that's out there from the big three, you may
1881600	1885600	want to go out and buy the newest and greatest, but at this point, I've seen no reason to
1885600	1887600	do so yet.
1887600	1890600	After all of these years of playing games, mostly competitive type games, I've become
1890600	1892600	more of a casual gamer than anything.
1892600	1898600	I find myself spending more time reading gaming news through various online sites than actually
1898600	1900600	playing them.
1900600	1905600	It was really hard not to just throw down the cash and buy a new console on any of the
1905600	1908600	launches, but I had to take a step back and look at what I currently have.
1908600	1911600	The prime console I own is the PS2.
1911600	1917600	When I actually took a look back at the games that I've yet to play over the years, I realized
1917600	1920600	that purchasing a new console would be a bad idea, especially considering the prices of
1920600	1921600	games now.
1921600	1927600	I've actually never played God of War, Devil May Cry 1 or 3, and many other critically
1927600	1931600	reviewed, I'm sorry, acclaimed titles like these.
1931600	1933600	There's not enough time in the day to play everything.
1933600	1934600	I haven't played some of those.
1934600	1939600	I really missed a lot of great titles on the PS2 by only playing certain games such as
1939600	1941600	Madden and Tekken 5.
1941600	1945600	Certainly with the case of Tekken 5, I would spend hours learning a character's move list
1945600	1949600	and practicing before visiting a group of the best local players here in Pittsburgh
1949600	1952600	who go by the name of Steel City Tekken.
1952600	1956600	Believe me, the practice had to be done to stand a chance against them.
1956600	1961600	Now, getting back to the point I'm trying to make, if you're the type of person who
1961600	1966600	missed out on a lot of games from the PS2 era, take a look at how many great AAA titles
1966600	1970600	you can buy on that console for the price of one next-gen game.
1970600	1974600	After looking through EB Games 1999 and Undersection on their site, I saw that you could get up
1974600	1978600	to seven PS2 games for the price of one $60 next-gen title.
1978600	1983600	So if you haven't yet made the commitment to any new next-gen console, I would go as
1983600	1988600	to say that the PS2 has one of the two greatest library of games ever on any console.
1988600	1992600	The original NES will always be first, in my opinion.
1992600	1994600	Also remember that the PS2 is not dead yet.
1994600	2000600	We still have Luminesce Live, God of War 2, and Final Cut of Kingdoms Hearts 2 to play soon.
2000600	2004600	Since I decided to stick with the PS2 a little longer, I went out and picked up a few games
2004600	2005600	that I missed.
2005600	2010600	I grabbed Syphon Filter Omega Stream, Devil May Cry Collector's Box Set, and Area 51,
2010600	2014600	not the original that was in the arcades and on the PS1 Saturn, for less than $60.
2014600	2017600	A five-to-one game ratio really sounds good to me right now.
2017600	2021600	I could write much more to prove my point, but I'm sure everyone can see where I'm coming
2021600	2022600	from.
2022600	2024600	Anyway, have a great show, and long live the PS2.
2024600	2027600	Could I say, though, that two of those games he says that we have to look forward to, we've
2027600	2030600	kind of already played, like Luminesce Live and Kingdom Hearts 2.
2030600	2034600	I mean, granted, you have some new stuff with those, but essentially we've seen those before.
2034600	2038600	I stopped playing Kingdom Hearts 2 as soon as they announced the Final Cut, because I'm
2038600	2039600	going to start over on that one.
2039600	2040600	All right, whatever.
2040600	2041600	Seriously.
2041600	2042600	I understand.
2042600	2043600	I understand.
2043600	2046600	I need to go back and finish Kingdom Hearts 1.
2046600	2047600	I never finish games.
2047600	2048600	I can't.
2048600	2049600	There's not enough time in the day.
2049600	2053600	I have to really love a game to finish it, and then my problem is I get sucked into MMOs.
2053600	2057600	Well, here's the last email, and I'm not going to read all of it, because there's a bunch
2057600	2061600	of reviews about the same sequel of the games and everything.
2061600	2062600	Hey, OLR.
2062600	2066600	This is the information about the Shadow Hearts RPG series that I promised a couple of weeks
2066600	2067600	ago.
2067600	2068600	I apologize for taking so long.
2068600	2070600	I definitely recommend that you give the series a try.
2070600	2073600	The first Shadow Hearts game, however, is hard to find, so you might have to find it
2073600	2074600	on eBay.
2074600	2076600	I'm interested on your opinions about the series.
2076600	2077600	Have a great night.
2077600	2079600	Shadow next gen.
2079600	2083600	And we have various links to them, so I'm going to check them out a little bit later.
2083600	2084600	Shadow Hearts, the series?
2084600	2085600	Yeah.
2085600	2088600	I know the last one that came out of New World looked pretty good.
2088600	2093600	Just didn't play it, because I don't have time to play every obscure RPG out there.
2093600	2095600	But yeah, it looked pretty cool.
2095600	2101600	Kind of a unique concept, kind of set in the 1940s, I believe.
2101600	2109600	You play a detective son who ends up finding these portals to another dimension almost,
2109600	2115600	and the stuff starts coming through, and basically has to fight it with a bunch of your usual,
2115600	2122600	typical RPG plot, a bunch of people that have no reason to be together, kind of come together,
2122600	2125600	and fight monsters and stuff.
2125600	2130600	It looks like a lot of folks in chat room agree with my gamer ADD perspective.
2130600	2133600	Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, you're not the only one who does that.
2133600	2136600	Paradox Vincent says, OMG, thank you, Sky, thank you, thank you, I'm not alone.
2136600	2138600	That's why I play music games.
2138600	2141600	And I think, to go back to what I had said in part A about somebody had said all I ever
2141600	2145600	seem to play are Xbox Live Arcade games, I think that might go help to explain it right
2145600	2149600	there, is that Xbox Live Arcade games, again, they're quick and not a lot of time, and really
2149600	2151600	satisfy my gamer ADD.
2151600	2154600	And yet, why I keep going back to World of Warcraft, I'll never understand.
2154600	2155600	I think it's the social aspect of that.
2155600	2156600	Who knows?
2156600	2160600	Well, my whole thing is, that's sort of why I was stuck on Cooking Mama for that long.
2160600	2166600	But, you know, I was thinking about it, and I own a lot of games that I haven't given
2166600	2168600	the attention that I'd like to give.
2168600	2173600	So, like, I'm going back, I've started over on Papalo Cross, just because, you know how
2173600	2177600	I was up in arms about how much I wanted to play that game, you know, for years.
2177600	2182600	So, I actually started over on Papalo Cross, so I can get to where I got before and actually
2182600	2184600	play through it this time.
2184600	2190600	You know, the reality is, you work, go to school, I work, do my hobbies on the side,
2190600	2193600	so does, you know, Loki, and all you folks who listen.
2193600	2197600	You're probably working right now, or school, or whatever it is you do.
2197600	2199600	There is not always enough time during the day.
2199600	2203600	And, you know, part of this show is that we don't claim to be the experts on every single
2203600	2204600	game out there.
2204600	2207600	And, certainly, there's those games we feel passionate about, but we're just like you
2207600	2208600	guys.
2208600	2211600	We're not getting paid to play games eight hours a day.
2211600	2212600	If somebody wanted to do that, great.
2212600	2215600	I mean, because, essentially, that's what you do when you visit those big websites,
2215600	2219600	like, you know, I'm not going to name them, but the ones that are, you know, sponsored
2219600	2222600	by magazine companies and things, you know.
2222600	2228600	Keep in mind, like, just my next week, I'm going to school four nights next week, doing
2228600	2232600	a CPR class, working on a website, working on art commissions, and working full-time.
2232600	2235600	So, I mean, that's a standard week.
2235600	2242600	You know, I, we don't get to have free time all the time to do all the stuff that we,
2242600	2245600	you know, would like to do, you know, to play all the, all the games.
2245600	2248600	And, you know, that's why- But when I do have free time, it's all about
2248600	2249600	the games.
2249600	2254600	Well, what I was trying to say is that that's why, you know, when we do the show, we actually
2254600	2258600	come and tell each other so that we can each give each other the impression of what we're,
2258600	2259600	you know, we're looking at.
2259600	2263600	You know, what's quick and easy to play, what's going to be a little time consuming, what
2263600	2265600	project's going on, that type of thing.
2265600	2267600	And no more e-mail, by the way.
2267600	2268600	Makes sense.
2268600	2270600	Except I got some spam, which I deleted.
2270600	2271600	I can say this.
2271600	2275600	I got an e-mail, and I neglected to mention this during housekeeping, but I'll mention
2275600	2278600	it next week so it's at the top of the show, because I know not everyone listens to the
2278600	2279600	whole thing.
2279600	2283600	But I do want to confirm that Orange Laundry is going to be back at Fauna Mae Con this
2283600	2288600	year, which is being held from May 25th to May 28th at the San Jose Convention Center.
2288600	2290600	At the San Jose Convention Center in California.
2290600	2291600	So.
2291600	2292600	Right?
2292600	2295600	I'll be there for the weekend.
2295600	2296600	Gotcha.
2296600	2297600	Okay.
2297600	2299600	The whole, I just found this out, too.
2299600	2300600	Right.
2300600	2305600	Dan's younger brother, his step-brother, is getting married the weekend before that.
2305600	2306600	I see.
2306600	2309600	So, I will definitely be there Saturday and Sunday.
2309600	2310600	Yeah, yeah.
2310600	2313600	Or Friday afternoon if I can at all manage it.
2313600	2317480	Even though we might not be there from open to close, we'll be there definitely doing
2317480	2321040	a live panel and taping a show live, like we did last year.
2321040	2323480	And I will be cosplaying as Annette Renard now.
2323480	2327080	I have no idea what I'm going to cosplay as, because I don't usually do cosplay, but we'll
2327080	2328080	see.
2328080	2331300	But regardless, cosplay aside, we'd love to see you guys turn out for the show.
2331300	2333920	As I understand, one of our listeners, Rama, is coming out from the East Coast for this
2333920	2338960	convention and has rented a fat hotel room, so it's going to be like a mini-OLR con of
2338960	2339960	sorts.
2339960	2341480	Fauna Mae Con is the sideshow.
2341480	2348760	I definitely need to remake my Temari costume, because the last one that was made, it was
2348760	2349760	too big.
2349760	2354480	So, we'll have more details on our involvement with Fauna Mae as the event approaches, but
2354480	2358200	that's really exciting, because we definitely are looking forward to bringing more video
2358200	2362760	game type content to Fauna Mae, because I don't know a lot about anime, so I can only
2362760	2364560	talk about video games.
2364560	2365800	Maybe Jamie can do the anime thing.
2365800	2366800	I can.
2366800	2370000	I'm actually thinking about starting to watch Bleach.
2370000	2377760	I watch Bleach when I pour it in the washer.
2377760	2378760	Alright.
2378760	2385760	Anyways, so, not having anything to do with Bleach or anime or anything like that, apparently,
2385760	2390920	well, unless you lived under a rock or something, you probably didn't realize, well, Vista just
2390920	2391920	came out.
2391920	2395040	All 50 billion- OMG, it did?
2395040	2396040	Yeah, really.
2396040	2401240	I'm just rushing right out to go buy it, like I did with XP.
2401240	2409560	But, if you happen to be gaming on a PC that has the parental control set on it, it might
2409560	2414800	actually break some of your casual games, like games that use Wild Tangent.
2414800	2424320	And according to your gamer, DirectX creator Alex St. John says, basically, that they tried
2424320	2430160	making sure that it wouldn't break all the different games out there, they thought they
2430160	2435640	covered everything, but unfortunately, Wild Tangent is denoted as spyware by the anti-spyware
2435640	2441960	applications in Vista, and says, normally the software is generally harmless, but it
2441960	2448240	does get installed without express- Isn't Wild Tangent the games that come with
2448240	2450880	AOL Instant Messenger, because those games are spyware.
2450880	2451880	I'm sorry.
2451880	2453480	Yeah, I think so.
2453480	2454480	Wild Tangent is spyware.
2454480	2455480	So, whatever.
2455480	2462720	I mean, it's not a huge deal, but just thought you might want to know, because there are
2462720	2465160	some people that like casual games like Christopher and-
2465160	2468840	Black Boy says, wow, Loki's News is old, they patched this already.
2468840	2471280	Yes, it is old.
2471280	2473560	And you know, it's just like, I don't care.
2473560	2478080	But nevertheless, you know, isn't it funny that they rolled out an operating system and
2478080	2479560	it broke half the games on it?
2479560	2483560	I mean, why should I upgrade to Windows Vista, anybody?
2483560	2486700	Would anybody like to tell me why I need to drop the money right now to upgrade to Windows
2486700	2487700	Vista?
2487700	2488700	I'm not going to.
2488700	2489700	You should upgrade your computer, too.
2489700	2490700	Because I don't- What?
2490700	2491700	You gotta upgrade your computer, too.
2491700	2493600	I don't understand why I need to upgrade right now.
2493600	2494600	I'm not.
2494600	2498240	I don't want to- This is all the more reason for me to just buy my iMac.
2498240	2500360	Screw Windows.
2500360	2503280	I mean, between the PC I have now and the Mac, I'm doing just fine.
2503280	2504560	I don't need Windows Vista.
2504560	2505560	What?
2505560	2507700	You look like you want to say something smart-ass so bad.
2507700	2508700	It's hurting you.
2508700	2509700	That's fine.
2509700	2510700	That's fine.
2510700	2511700	You guys are fine with your Macs.
2511700	2512700	That's great.
2512700	2515320	I'm sure games will come to it eventually.
2515320	2519680	I don't play PC games and the only PC game I play is World of Warcraft.
2519680	2522400	And I have Guild Wars on my laptop so I don't have to worry about it.
2522400	2525560	Jeremy Todd 1 says there's no reason to upgrade right now.
2525560	2526560	Simple as that.
2526560	2529760	Just upgrade in a couple years and there's actually a reason to upgrade.
2529760	2535100	DDR Dollar Bill says Vista has had a lot of returns.
2535100	2536100	So we'll see.
2536100	2537100	Maybe later.
2537100	2548160	I don't know how well it's running.
2548160	2549600	I'm hearing it's got performance issues.
2549600	2553040	But nevertheless, this is certainly something you're not seeing returned as often.
2553040	2557240	It's World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade.
2557240	2560440	You think people are World of Warcraft addicts here.
2560440	2565480	You should check out China because the Nine released World of Warcraft locally for China.
2565480	2568480	They got 3.5 million subscribers in China.
2568480	2571600	So it's pretty big over there as well.
2571600	2572600	Well guess what?
2572600	2576960	Burning Crusade is also going to be coming to China, which I suppose isn't the most shocking
2576960	2577960	news in the world.
2577960	2581380	But maybe you didn't realize it wasn't already out over there.
2581380	2583160	They're going to have to wait a little bit for this game.
2583160	2588060	So Chinese localization is already underway for the Burning Crusade and the Nine is working
2588060	2594200	closely with Blizzard to offer all the same support that Blizzard offers to the US customers
2594200	2596320	and also the distribution and all that stuff.
2596320	2601100	A quick quote here from Blizzard, quote, we're fully committed to ensuring that the ongoing
2601100	2605040	operation of World of Warcraft in mainland China will provide an excellent experience
2605040	2607160	for players there for many years to come.
2607160	2610620	We look forward to extending that commitment with this expansion as well as with future
2610620	2612160	Blizzard releases.
2612160	2616040	So it sounds like if we get it here, you're going to get it in China from the Nine, even
2616040	2617840	if it is a little bit later on.
2617840	2620160	You have to just wait for all the localization and stuff.
2620160	2622000	Like well, we have to do that for Japanese games.
2622000	2626840	So it's only fair that that side of the world has to wait for us once in a while.
2626840	2628760	Oh, and then they get the joy of patching.
2628760	2632800	Yes, then you get to patch World of Warcraft seven times before you can play it.
2632800	2633800	It's so much fun.
2633800	2636800	And then it won't patch and then you have to download it and do it yourself.
2636800	2637800	Cool.
2637800	2638800	Anyway.
2638800	2639800	Actually, can I suggest this real quick?
2639800	2642040	XFire has a patching system built in that's actually pretty good.
2642040	2646160	I have to say you wouldn't think I would usually endorse a program like XFire, but actually
2646160	2647160	it's really cool.
2647160	2648920	I really like XFire.
2648920	2652200	I think that's a great little application, anyway, for a PC gamer.
2652200	2653200	Anyway, sorry.
2653200	2654200	We'll take your word for it, Rob.
2654200	2655200	Yeah, please do.
2655200	2656200	Okay.
2656200	2661460	Speaking of MMOs, there is an MMO coming to the UK.
2661460	2663200	It's called Two Worlds.
2663200	2668880	It's being released on PC and Xbox 360.
2668880	2678760	The good thing about it, it's a free roaming RPG that's the orc versus human deal.
2678760	2692960	But the cool thing is that it has unique quests, a one-on-one arena battle, horse races, and
2692960	2696840	customizable characters with no level capping.
2696840	2698440	So that's pretty cool.
2698440	2701200	I can truly be a god character in that game.
2701200	2703720	I hear it's very similar to Oblivion.
2703720	2704720	Yeah.
2704720	2705720	Very similar to Oblivion.
2705720	2708440	Jeremy Tell One wants to point out and clarify from what he's read about the game.
2708440	2711160	The 360 version only has eight player multiplayer.
2711160	2713400	Only the PC version is an MMO.
2713400	2715160	Eight players is still not bad.
2715160	2716160	That's still fun.
2716160	2717880	That's still an OL army.
2717880	2718880	And eight players.
2718880	2719880	That'll be fun.
2719880	2721920	Now, here's what I want to know, because I haven't really read up on much.
2721920	2726880	I wonder if Crackdown is more than two players co-op, because that'd be awesome if you have
2726880	2727880	like four people.
2727880	2728880	Hmm.
2728880	2729880	I don't know.
2729880	2732840	I guess we'll see more when the game comes out, because if it's coming on 360, we'll
2732840	2734320	probably get a demo.
2734320	2735320	So who knows?
2735320	2736320	Yeah.
2736320	2744640	Anyways, so just like tons of stuff coming out now on the 360, including some brand new
2744640	2746560	Xbox Live Arcade games.
2746560	2749520	And they announced ten new games that are going to be coming out.
2749520	2751340	Some of these we've heard of before.
2751340	2752560	Some we have not.
2752560	2754960	For example, 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures.
2754960	2757760	A little bit different than 3D Ultra Mini Golf.
2757760	2763120	It was one of the Sierra Online games, which I loved, by the way.
2763120	2766600	So that's going to become an Alien Hominid HD, which is kind of an HD upgrade to the
2766600	2768600	original Alien Hominid game.
2768600	2771320	Band of Bugs, which is supposed to be by Ninjabi.
2771320	2774280	It's kind of a, I guess, a strategy game.
2774280	2775280	It's kind of neat.
2775280	2776600	Castlevania Symphony of Night.
2776600	2778000	No big surprise there.
2778000	2779000	Catan.
2779000	2780000	Settlers Catan.
2780000	2783120	Remember that was one that was remembered to be coming at some point.
2783120	2784120	Eats.
2784120	2785120	Chowdown.
2785120	2790640	Kind of a different game, I guess, as a port of a PC title by the same name.
2790640	2792780	Luxor 2, which should make Nelly happy.
2792780	2795560	Another kind of Zuma clone type of thing.
2795560	2797400	Paper Boy.
2797400	2798800	Root Beer Tapper.
2798800	2800360	Paper Boy and Root Beer Tapper are awesome.
2800360	2804980	I know you guys bitch about the classic coin-op ports, but these are some true classics that
2804980	2806280	are underrated, I think.
2806280	2812740	And then my favorite of the list here, Worms HD is going to be coming out, and that's awesome.
2812740	2817520	We used to have epic Worms multiplayer going on in my house.
2817520	2818520	Worms is awesome.
2818520	2821420	You know what's interesting though, and we neglected to say this in our coverage of Konami
2821420	2824600	Gamer's Day, but did you notice they had nothing on Xbox Live Arcade?
2824600	2827720	I was very surprised we didn't see Castlevania Symphony of Night on Live Arcade, because
2827720	2828720	they had it at CES.
2828720	2833440	I would have thought that's what they would have used their 360s for instead of showing
2833440	2834440	Wii 11.
2834440	2837840	That's kind of what I thought we were going to see too, but I guess not.
2837840	2838840	That's alright.
2838840	2845040	Alright, well, speaking of Xbox Live, Crackdown has shattered records on Xbox Live.
2845040	2850140	You know it had a demo released, and it shattered the demos, or shattered records away from
2850140	2855140	Lost Planet and Fight Night, the most downloaded demo for a 24-hour period, and the most downloaded
2855140	2861640	demo during a seven-day period, and that's without Halo 3, you know, beta stuff.
2861640	2864800	I don't know if people are maybe downloading this to see if it's worth it, if they want
2864800	2865800	to do the Halo 3.
2865800	2866800	It's fun.
2866800	2867800	I've played the demo.
2867800	2868800	I can play the demo all week.
2868800	2869800	I couldn't get into it.
2869800	2872300	I'll have to do co-op with somebody who can kind of show me what the hell I'm supposed
2872300	2875320	to be doing, because I didn't get it, but I'm stupid sometimes.
2875320	2880240	You can punch people, then throw them in the cars, and then throw cars on top of them,
2880240	2881240	and then you can, like...
2881240	2882240	I'll try it again.
2882240	2886000	What's great, though, is they have achievements for throwing dead bodies into the air, then
2886000	2888720	bouncing them off, or bouncing rockets off of them.
2888720	2891200	I'll just have to come over and watch you play at some point, and see if it's worth
2891200	2892200	it for me.
2892200	2893200	It's so worth it.
2893200	2896200	I swear I'm going to sign up for a game rental site or something this week, so I stop buying
2896200	2897480	all this stuff new.
2897480	2899040	We'll see.
2899040	2903960	Anyhow, I guess that's all I have to say about Crackdown.
2903960	2912680	Well, there is different games to be downloaded, especially Castlevania Symphony of the Night
2912680	2916600	on Xbox Live Arcade.
2916600	2921760	They were talking about the memory card coming out that was supposed to be 256 megabytes,
2921760	2930880	but the pre-order on GameStop's website is 512 megabytes for the portable memory.
2930880	2932920	So in other words, they give it a secret upgrade.
2932920	2934680	Now it's 512.
2934680	2936400	Or is it a typo on GameStop's end?
2936400	2937400	What do you think, Loki?
2937400	2942760	I haven't heard of anything official about them upgrading that, although I'm assuming
2942760	2948560	that we'll find something new, or find out something about it pretty soon, if not at
2948560	2949560	all.
2949560	2952680	It seems kind of logical that would happen, though, right?
2952680	2953680	Yeah.
2953680	2959160	I mean, it makes sense, because 256, I mean, the price point for it was a bit more expensive,
2959160	2963080	and I don't know why you'd buy a memory unit anyways.
2963080	2965360	I mean, spend the extra money and just get a hard drive.
2965360	2966360	That's what I say.
2966360	2969520	Just get the damn hard drive, unless you really have a need to take that shit with you on
2969520	2970520	the go.
2970520	2971520	There's really no point.
2971520	2972520	Exactly.
2972520	2976360	So, yeah, no idea if this is official yet.
2976360	2977360	I'd imagine...
2977360	2981440	I don't think it's going to be a typo, because I think originally they had 256 on there,
2981440	2983440	so they probably just got it updated.
2983440	2984440	Interesting.
2984440	2985440	I don't know.
2985440	2986440	I'll keep my eyes out.
2986440	2987440	Please do.
2987440	2988440	Eyes and ears.
2988440	2990760	I'll check them out.
2990760	2996920	But anywho, so beyond the bigger memory cards, there is going to be another epic game coming
2996920	3005240	to the Xbox 360, as well as PlayStation 3, Unreal Tournament.
3005240	3009720	One unique thing about this, and I think we mentioned this back on an earlier show, they're
3009720	3014480	going to be allowing mods to be used on PlayStation 3 and the 360 version, probably as well as
3014480	3016200	the PC.
3016200	3021160	Of course, they're also going to be including user-created mods as well.
3021160	3024840	So that's actually kind of cool, that they're allowing mods on there, because I know there's
3024840	3029480	been some pretty good mods available for Unreal and Half-Life 2 and stuff.
3029480	3034680	It'd be really cool to see some of the stuff downloadable online.
3034680	3036520	Although no idea when this game's coming out.
3036520	3039720	I like the idea of user mods coming out online.
3039720	3044160	I mean, the only time I can think of user-created content outside of an MMO that I've seen on
3044160	3050840	like Xbox, it would be like DDR Steps on ultraMix 2 through 4, whatever, have those steps you
3050840	3052380	could download online.
3052380	3057800	So you don't see a whole lot of user-created content, so that's kind of cool, I think.
3057800	3063760	Also what's kind of cool, a Flash-based computer game called N, which I used to play religiously.
3063760	3067200	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
3067200	3069520	Describe N. I've never played N. What is N all about, Loki?
3069520	3073360	N kind of has a stick figure, like ninja type of character that you run around collecting
3073360	3074360	the gems.
3074360	3076440	Oh God, I've watched you play this game before.
3076440	3077440	I know what...
3077440	3079000	Okay, sorry, keep going.
3079000	3080600	So anyways, it's pretty awesome though.
3080600	3084960	You just run around and you collect stuff and there's like, as the levels go on it gets
3084960	3088640	harder and harder and there's like missiles and stuff you have to dodge and you just have
3088640	3090520	to make it through the time limit and stuff.
3090520	3092000	I've totally seen you play this game before.
3092000	3093200	Okay, now I know what it is.
3093200	3096000	Well, N Plus is coming out on Live Arcade later this year.
3096000	3097000	Will you be buying that?
3097000	3098000	Yes.
3098000	3099000	Alright, very cool.
3099000	3101840	Of course, who knows how long it's going to get delayed because by this time we were supposed
3101840	3109200	to see Castle Crashers, but not that we're bitter or anything like the rest of you.
3109200	3112400	Alright, let's go to the website of the week.
3112400	3116120	Every week Dark Sakura climbs the internet up and down and back and forth and finds a
3116120	3120080	website suitable of sharing with the rest of you and we call it Dark Sakura's website
3120080	3125000	of the week, a website for you to visit besides orangelaungeradio.com.
3125000	3133960	So Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers this week besides orangelaungeradio.com?
3133960	3137800	The website of the week is the Castlevania Dungeon.
3137800	3144480	You can get there by going to castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com.
3144480	3148560	I will be, of course, reposting the link in the chat room which I have actually already
3148560	3155320	done once today because I was posting links to images of the original Rondo of Blood.
3155320	3162000	But if you go into the site, it has write-ups on every one of the games.
3162000	3167400	The first thing that you see is actually a big screen print of the updated Rondo of Blood.
3167400	3172880	There's artwork, multimedia, emulation, fan fiction.
3172880	3173880	It's really cool.
3173880	3178520	I've actually been going on this site in upwards of eight years now.
3178520	3187880	It really is the, I'd have to say, most in-depth Castlevania site ever and really I can't say
3187880	3189040	good enough about it.
3189040	3191160	It really is up there.
3191160	3197640	In fact, this site actually, if Dan told me right, inspired his site that he used to have
3197640	3202440	back in the day which was Neo Strider's Strider's Own, if you wouldn't ever remember that.
3202440	3203440	Nerds.
3203440	3205440	I did his graphics form.
3205440	3210040	This was partly my site too, but Castlevania invention is just fantastic.
3210040	3212640	Kudos to the folks that run it.
3212640	3217720	You guys have been just keeping it awesome for years and so cool.
3217720	3218720	So go there.
3218720	3219720	Now.
3219720	3220720	I mean, after the show.
3220720	3223360	Why am I not surprised the Castlevania site made it for her website of the week?
3223360	3225640	Well, it was going to be history.com.
3225640	3228400	Now you just gave away what next week was likely to be.
3228400	3230320	No, next week isn't history.com.
3230320	3233080	I am completely shocked.
3233080	3234080	Completely shocked.
3234080	3235080	That's what I thought.
3235080	3241120	Anyways, there was some other weird news that managed to leak out this week.
3241120	3247880	This website, DVD Empire, they were making big news about exiting the video game business
3247880	3254720	and apparently gave their top eight reasons why they are leaving the game business.
3254720	3258080	Now most people are like, who the fuck is DVD Empire?
3258080	3263360	Well the only way I've heard of them before is because, well a couple of reasons.
3263360	3269840	One, they're the legit side of adult DVD Empire, which is big on adult movies.
3269840	3275080	The other thing is we actually sell to them, or we did at one time I guess because now
3275080	3276080	they're out in the business.
3276080	3282320	But I just thought it was interesting some of the reasons that they mentioned that they're
3282320	3287580	leaving the game's business because it actually doesn't make any sense.
3287580	3289200	And I don't think a lot of sites are covering this.
3289200	3291560	Well let me just real quickly go down the list.
3291560	3295040	Number one, video game industry does not care.
3295040	3299000	The video game industry only cares about the mass emergence like Toys R Us, Walmart, Best
3299000	3300000	Buy, etc.
3300000	3304640	They completely ignore the needs and wants of medium or small game retailers and below
3304640	3306080	is how they do it.
3306080	3308000	Well that's sort of true.
3308000	3311960	I mean you're not going to be able to bring in a retail kiosk or anything like that if
3311960	3313200	you're a small guy.
3313200	3315600	You have to be doing a lot of business with them.
3315600	3319560	They can't make money they say, which is funny because I have a lot of customers that do
3319560	3323080	make money and lots of it, but whatever.
3323080	3328360	You may not care whether or not we make money but we continue to pay to sell video games.
3328360	3331120	Is impossible for us to make money selling video games.
3331120	3335780	Video game manufacturers set the price using what they call MSRP and here's an example
3335780	3337760	the video gaming industry greed.
3337760	3341100	They set the retail price at $5 above product costs.
3341100	3343880	Buy it for $54.99, sell it for $59.99.
3343880	3346860	That is completely untrue.
3346860	3352960	Their price, which I happened to after reading this, I looked it up, is way below that price.
3352960	3360960	In fact, I think they were, at least for us, buying 6% or their discount was our cost plus
3360960	3362040	6%.
3362040	3365900	So they were actually paying 6% over what we paid for it.
3365900	3369520	So they were still making tons of money on this stuff and there's never that type of
3369520	3371920	margins on stuff at all.
3371920	3374920	So I don't know what the fuck they're talking about there and they can definitely make money
3374920	3376480	off of that stuff.
3376480	3380400	They're also saying no price protection, games dropping price quickly.
3380400	3384720	These guys used to buy one piece of different things at a time.
3384720	3387820	So they wouldn't have a large inventory, that wouldn't even apply.
3387820	3391840	No returns, that's all over the industry.
3391840	3393120	They say distribution is dumb.
3393120	3398280	I don't know who their rep was so that might be the case but they say basically that they
3398280	3400480	get their product three days after street date.
3400480	3405980	Well unless they are a big chain company, they won't get any product on street date
3405980	3410400	because you have to be direct with the actual publishers in order to get stuff on street
3410400	3411400	date.
3411400	3413660	So they're just stupid.
3413660	3417600	And better suited for brick and mortar retailers, that might be true but either way they're
3417600	3419800	just bitching and moaning.
3419800	3421800	Good riddance.
3421800	3425920	Travis Donovan from our own Saturday Night Program here at Orange Lounge Radio says,
3425920	3430160	I tried ordering from them back in 02 and it took three weeks to get my order and then
3430160	3433680	it was wrong and then another month and a half to get what I ordered.
3433680	3436040	All their games are now 20% off.
3436040	3441640	I'm sure you were buying games and not porno, right Travis?
3441640	3445360	The other thing too they were talking about here, there are some updates at the bottom
3445360	3447520	of their little bitch page here.
3447520	3449200	They have three different updates.
3449200	3452800	One of them says, we knew about the low profit margins when developing our games division.
3452800	3453800	Why are you bitching?
3453800	3456640	Why did they put up a bitch page in the first place?
3456640	3457640	It's so retarded.
3457640	3458640	It's kind of a professional.
3458640	3459640	It's so retarded.
3459640	3462720	And then the other one, people responded to our news with, well your model sucked, you
3462720	3464400	should have sold these games and accessories.
3464400	3472560	Let me put it this way, there are retailers and smaller guys that sell a lot more than
3472560	3476640	you guys do and sure as hell, I don't know if we were their only distributor, but if
3476640	3479320	we were, they weren't buying anything.
3479320	3482120	They weren't hardly buying anything.
3482120	3487040	They are just really whining and get out of the business.
3487040	3490720	Well one thing I'm sure will be successful no matter how it's delivered to folks would
3490720	3495280	be a Katamari Damacy online game.
3495280	3496280	Get this.
3496280	3502120	A Japanese gaming site called 4Gamer has reported that the Korean publisher WindySoft is bringing
3502120	3504320	out Katamari Damacy online.
3504320	3508900	It signed a contract in November of 2006 and Cyberstep has already begun development of
3508900	3512120	the game, a late 2007 release.
3512120	3517040	The gameplay of Katamari Damacy online is kind of like the versus battle from PS2 and
3517040	3520680	PSP and now it's going to be in an online arena.
3520680	3522720	There will also be community management features.
3522720	3526560	There's going to be pet and house elements collectibles.
3526560	3530340	You also supposedly can make your own island and create custom clothing from the items
3530340	3532520	you get while playing.
3532520	3533520	Very interesting.
3533520	3537080	Hopefully, we'll see this on the US side, but if not, I'm sure a lot of people will
3537080	3540860	figure out how to play it nonetheless because there's always the cult of people who want
3540860	3543640	to play those games.
3543640	3547140	We would like to take this opportunity to welcome your phone calls at this time by opening
3547140	3548760	up our Skype line.
3548760	3552080	Our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3552080	3554580	That number is toll free in the United States and Canada.
3554580	3558780	If you'd rather, though, or if you're in another country, you should call us on Skype.
3558780	3561000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3561000	3566420	You can get more detail by going to our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com and clicking on
3566420	3568000	interact with us.
3568000	3571360	So while we wait for some phone calls, do you have any last minute news, some real quick
3571360	3573160	last minute news, anyone?
3573160	3575400	Yes, real quick.
3575400	3580080	A couple of things, there's some stuff being developed for the PSP, homebrew stuff.
3580080	3585440	One of these is the Legend Zelda Quest for Link and actually looks kind of cool, kind
3585440	3590040	of resembles the Super Nintendo Zelda, so if you want to check that, PSP Updates has
3590040	3591680	the link for you.
3591680	3595640	And then there's also one that looks like a cross between Zombies Ate My Neighbors and
3595640	3603480	Biohazard 2 version 2.0 final has been released and yeah, it looks exactly like Zombies Ate
3603480	3605560	My Neighbors.
3605560	3607120	All right, let's go to some calls.
3607120	3610200	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
3610200	3611200	Raven's Dolphin.
3611200	3614800	Oh yes, you again, how are you doing Raven's Dolphin?
3614800	3618600	I just got something to tell you about all games and you.
3618600	3619600	Okay, what?
3619600	3620600	You sounded tired.
3620600	3624480	Well, it was 9.30 when I finally got through.
3624480	3628240	It was 12.30 when I was over here.
3628240	3631600	You know what, as well as that there was a lot going on here at the house, so I was kind
3631600	3635680	of in my bedroom, like lying down, talking on the phone and what else should be said.
3635680	3641060	Not to, again, I love all games, but their phone system, I don't know if it happens to
3641060	3645880	you when you call in, but you hear yourself echoing and it totally bugs.
3645880	3646880	Like I couldn't.
3646880	3647880	Oh, I agree.
3647880	3648880	It's not you.
3648880	3650680	I couldn't hear anything they were saying, so it was tough.
3650680	3654240	It hasn't always been that way because I've been on the show before and I didn't have
3654240	3655240	that.
3655240	3656920	But anyway, is that all you wanted to say?
3656920	3657920	Yeah, two more things.
3657920	3658920	Okay, what else?
3658920	3662560	Sam & Max is great on GameTap, I've been enjoying myself with it.
3662560	3666560	I freaking updated GameTap this week, meaning to play it, and then I got sucked into something
3666560	3667560	else.
3667560	3668560	I played one of their stupid arcade games.
3668560	3669560	I know.
3669560	3670560	I don't.
3670560	3674160	Well, that too, but you know, some of the, because GameTap has like 800 games on it,
3674160	3676920	so it's like you go there, I'm like, oh, I'm going to finally play Missed Online or Sam
3676920	3680280	& Max, and then I'm like, holy shit, they put this game on there?
3680280	3681760	I've totally got to play that game.
3681760	3684240	So I think it was like Rainbow Islands or some crap.
3684240	3685240	I know, ADD.
3685240	3686240	I know.
3686240	3687240	You're ADD.
3687240	3688240	Yeah, there it is.
3688240	3689240	You know?
3689240	3690240	I do.
3690240	3692520	I couldn't finish Hitman, and that made me mad.
3692520	3695280	I wanted to finish it, and it made me mad.
3695280	3696280	What else is on your mind?
3696280	3702640	Okay, I have to tell you about the Mario Kart 64 thing.
3702640	3703920	I have to tell you why.
3703920	3705960	Why the Save Ghost thing?
3705960	3713040	It's because the Wii, the emulator for the N64 doesn't realize that it's not an N64 before.
3713040	3715960	It's running on a Wii, so it's thinking it's on an N64.
3715960	3722000	That's what an emulator is, but it's thinking that it's an N64, and it's thinking that it
3722000	3726520	has an N64 pack in it, but it thinks it needs that.
3726520	3729320	It needs that, but in retrospect, it doesn't have it.
3729320	3734520	I kind of sort of was implying that when I said that in order to make it work, they would
3734520	3739040	have to go and recode the game itself, and that's a lot more than just trying to emulate
3739040	3740040	it correctly.
3740040	3741040	But you're right.
3741040	3744360	They would have to recode the game to instead of looking for the memory pack, look for the
3744360	3752560	Wii's memory, and that's not something that's easily done with a ten-year-old game.
3752560	3757920	I know that other emulated sites like Project, I'm not going to say the rest, but they got
3757920	3762400	through that, but the Wii, it's built up emulation.
3762400	3764720	It's only going to pull what it thinks.
3764720	3768680	The save states that are on the cartridge will work fine on the Wii.
3768680	3772880	It's just those cartridge games might not.
3772880	3776960	I do want to say this, though, I do agree that Nintendo definitely should use that patching
3776960	3779720	feature to fix some of these things.
3779720	3783540	Not so much the ghost thing, I could care less about that, but I would just love to
3783540	3788400	see them give little bonuses, especially the multiplayer.
3788400	3792520	Especially with the old-ass 8-bit games like Mario Brothers, how much more valuable would
3792520	3794760	games like that be if we could play those online?
3794760	3795760	Seriously.
3795760	3798760	Just one more second.
3798760	3805200	I thought the emulation was good on the N64, wouldn't you be pissed if you played Mario
3805200	3807800	and it was off one millisecond?
3807800	3808800	Yeah.
3808800	3811840	Alright, that's all I have to say.
3811840	3815200	I do want to say one other thing, though, about the emulation is that one thing, having
3815200	3819840	the widescreen HD and everything, I noticed that the Xbox 360 is smart enough to put the
3819840	3824140	vertical letterbox on my games when I'm playing something that's not widescreen, but the Nintendo
3824140	3829200	Wii is not, and I really wish it was, and that is not a very hard fix.
3829200	3833400	And yes, I realize I could dig up the TV remote and switch it that way, but it's so much easier
3833400	3835200	when the system just does it automatically.
3835200	3838600	I would love to see Nintendo make that little patch.
3838600	3840000	You're right, and that's it.
3840000	3841680	I want you to get another call.
3841680	3842680	No problem.
3842680	3847560	Thank you, Ravenstaufen, for your opinion, as always.
3847560	3850360	He had his agenda tonight, and he has 123 agenda.
3850360	3851360	Bravo.
3851360	3852360	Good job.
3852360	3856280	Welcome your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or the Skype line.
3856280	3857680	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3857680	3858680	Who's this?
3858680	3859680	Hey, what's up?
3859680	3860680	It's the Rob D.
3860680	3861680	Hi, the Rob D. How are you doing?
3861680	3862680	Not too bad.
3862680	3866120	Well, actually, I'm a little bit sad, but it has nothing to do with anything other than
3866120	3870200	the Super Bowl, so I'm from Chicago.
3870200	3873640	We're not too big on the Super Bowl here, but I understand it was a big thing for folks
3873640	3874640	around Chicago.
3874640	3879600	I know one of our lesbians is from the immediate area around there and is a big Chicago fan,
3879600	3880600	so I'm sure...
3880600	3883720	I mean, she's in Wisconsin and is a Bears fan, so...
3883720	3885400	Didn't she have cameras or something?
3885400	3890960	I don't think so, but I was secretly rooting for the Bears for her sake, so I'm very sorry.
3890960	3896200	I was rooting for the Bears simply because I was hoping they'd make another music video.
3896200	3897200	Super Bowl Shuffle?
3897200	3898200	Yes, exactly.
3898200	3902520	My favorite life in that is probably Now I'm As Smooth As A Chocolate Swirl.
3902520	3905660	But you have to admit, and without getting too much further into sports, you have to
3905660	3907320	admit that opening touchdown was hilarious.
3907320	3908320	Yeah, definitely.
3908320	3909320	Comedy gold.
3909320	3910880	What's on your mind tonight, game-wise?
3910880	3915640	Well basically, I have to talk about the whole ghost saving thing with a memory pack.
3915640	3916640	Popular topic tonight, yes.
3916640	3917640	What's on your mind?
3917640	3922040	Well, I disagree that it has to do with hacking the game itself or altering the game itself
3922040	3923040	in any way.
3923040	3927760	I think that the emulator could be programmed to emulate a control pack itself, an older
3927760	3928760	memory pack.
3928760	3929760	I mean...
3929760	3930760	I suppose...
3930760	3931760	I don't know.
3931760	3932960	I guess maybe I'm just thinking...
3932960	3936080	The reason why my brain goes there is I'm thinking maybe it's just simply the way the
3936080	3939680	data is written, or you're talking about different types of memory.
3939680	3940680	I don't know.
3940680	3941680	My brain...
3941680	3944200	For some reason, I'm thinking in my mind it has to be the game that's recoded.
3944200	3945200	I don't know.
3945200	3948320	I wish Nintendo would be more open, but you know they're not going to tell us the specifics.
3948320	3952360	Well, I'm just curious, since every PC emulator has figured out a way to get around save data,
3952360	3955760	it would only take a little bit of ingenuity to get around it on the Wii.
3955760	3956880	I suppose.
3956880	3961320	But unfortunately, the Wii is so locked down when it comes to hacking and all that stuff.
3961320	3965480	It's got to be Nintendo who does it, and I honestly don't think they care enough.
3965480	3969000	I think they just want to start cranking out more virtual console games for us to buy.
3969000	3973160	I think they want to get working on Pokemon Snap and whatever else on the 64 they're going
3973160	3974160	to be bringing us.
3974160	3975160	Ocarina of Time.
3975160	3976160	All that crap.
3976160	3978320	Yeah, it's not a big deal for Ghost Data.
3978320	3980600	I never used it in the 64 version anyway.
3980600	3984200	Yeah, I didn't have a memory pack, so it's kind of a moot point to me.
3984200	3987880	I'm like, oh, well that's too bad I can't save Ghost Data, but then again, I'm barely
3987880	3990400	playing this as it is because I have such bad gamer ADD.
3990400	3997160	The other thing I'd like to comment on, though, is since Final Fantasy VI comes out this week
3997160	3999760	for the Game Boy Advance, I think that's a great thing.
3999760	4001080	I love Final Fantasy VI.
4001080	4003440	It's my favorite Final Fantasy game ever.
4003440	4008760	Terra's theme is quite possibly my favorite piece of music from any game.
4008760	4011080	The opera is one of the best scenes in video games.
4011080	4019520	It could be the best scene, but the opera scene is possibly the best scene in video
4019520	4021940	game history, period.
4021940	4025760	When I went to the More Friends concert a couple years ago before E3 and they reenacted
4025760	4028640	that thing, like they had the actual opera singers, just chills.
4028640	4032520	Even though the rest of the concert had sound glitches galore, that part was phenomenal.
4032520	4033520	Phenomenal.
4033520	4039720	But why haven't we seen a remake of Chrono Trigger?
4039720	4041960	Didn't they touch it on the PlayStation 1 at least?
4041960	4042960	They did.
4042960	4043960	Final Fantasy Chronicle.
4043960	4044960	Yeah.
4044960	4048360	You know, it's kind of like, why doesn't Nintendo do a new Kid Icarus?
4048360	4053680	It's kind of like, it squares little franchise that they're just kind of waiting for the
4053680	4056420	right time on, I suppose, to really wow us with something.
4056420	4057420	But yeah, that is kind of interesting.
4057420	4059000	Why haven't we seen a Chrono Trigger type game on the PS?
4059000	4062600	I wonder if the other part of it isn't Toriyama's stake in it.
4062600	4063600	Maybe.
4063600	4071320	Toriyama is a really big name in art in Japan, so it could possibly be his own stake in it.
4071320	4076120	Yeah, but what other RPG could it give me to care about an anthropomorphic frog?
4076120	4077720	True.
4077720	4079760	Maybe they'll add one in Final Fantasy 6.
4079760	4080760	Battle Toads.
4080760	4083720	Hey, what happened to Battle Toads vs. Double Dragon?
4083720	4085400	Battle Toads was too fucking hard.
4085400	4086400	Everyone gave up on it.
4086400	4090260	Yeah, it took me forever to get through, but I did actually view that game, but that's
4090260	4091260	a different story altogether.
4091260	4094320	That's all I had to say, so I'll leave you to the rest of the show.
4094320	4095320	No problem.
4095320	4098080	Thanks so much for your insight, Rob D. We've been enjoying your chat comments tonight.
4098080	4099080	Thank you.
4099080	4100080	All right, take care, buddy.
4100080	4101080	You too.
4101080	4102080	Later.
4102080	4104120	All right, let's go to another call right here on the line.
4104120	4105360	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4105360	4106360	Who's this?
4106360	4107360	This is Brad from Pod Culture.
4107360	4108360	Hey, Brad from Pod Culture.
4108360	4109360	Hi.
4109360	4110360	How you doing, buddy?
4110360	4111360	Howdy.
4111360	4114600	I'm short, I'm fat, and I'm going bald, but other than that, okay.
4114600	4116560	Well, real life sucks, but that's okay.
4116560	4118960	That's why we have the internet.
4118960	4121280	What's on your mind, buddy?
4121280	4122720	Not a whole lot.
4122720	4124160	Just got a wee this week.
4124160	4125160	Wee!
4125160	4127360	I see your username comment says this, too.
4127360	4128360	Wee!
4128360	4129360	And I apologize.
4129360	4131720	I got your message about the friend code, but I've been so horrible at adding it.
4131720	4134360	I have like four people I have to add, so I will add you, I promise.
4134360	4135640	Rob's not as bad as me.
4135640	4137640	I've got like ten people waiting.
4137640	4138640	I have a queue.
4138640	4140120	That's no big thing.
4140120	4143320	I'm more interested in playing with the me's more than anything else.
4143320	4144640	I will send you my doctor.
4144640	4146680	I will send you the goat say me.
4146680	4147680	Somebody made me.
4147680	4148680	It's disgusting.
4148680	4149680	It's brilliant.
4149680	4150680	Oh, Lord.
4150680	4151680	I have Michael Jackson and the doctor.
4151680	4153980	I think it was SSJ100Matt made it.
4153980	4155240	It's a goat say me.
4155240	4156240	It's hilarious.
4156240	4157840	That's so wrong on so many levels.
4157840	4158840	But funny.
4158840	4162240	Anyway, what else is on your mind regarding the wee?
4162240	4169320	Well, I got the Mario Kart 64, downloaded that today, and not only that, the problem
4169320	4174240	with the ghost data, I was having problems with plugging in my GameCube controller and
4174240	4175240	using it.
4175240	4179920	Oh, because those games are optimized for the Wii Classic controller.
4179920	4181400	I haven't tried the GameCube controller.
4181400	4183720	What were the problems you were having?
4183720	4187640	It's like the A button wouldn't work.
4187640	4188640	And I know it's not the controller.
4188640	4193440	I played that, played a NASCAR game on it the other day.
4193440	4194640	Oh, boy.
4194640	4199160	Well, do you think it's going to be worth shelling out the money for a Classic controller
4199160	4201760	to get the optimized experience?
4201760	4203440	Which I went and did.
4203440	4204440	Did you really?
4204440	4205440	Yeah.
4205440	4207120	And did it play a lot better for you?
4207120	4210600	Other than the fact that that controller itself sucks.
4210600	4212560	You don't like the Wii Classic controller?
4212560	4213560	No.
4213560	4215040	What is it about it you don't like?
4215040	4219840	I guess I'm being used to the Xbox controller or PlayStation.
4219840	4221760	It's just the way that it fits in the hands.
4221760	4222760	I see.
4222760	4227240	It is a little – the thing that weirds me out about the controller is all the buttons
4227240	4228760	on the top of it.
4228760	4232440	Like there's an L button, an R button, and then like a little Z, and these other little
4232440	4233440	nubs on it.
4233440	4235320	And I'm like, there's too many buttons.
4235320	4240040	Is it me or is the A and B buttons reversed from what they normally would be on the controller?
4240040	4243560	I think they're right, but sometimes if you play a lot of Japanese games, they're
4243560	4246360	usually backwards, and so that can kind of mess with you.
4246360	4248280	It just seems like it's in a weird place.
4248280	4249280	Yeah.
4249280	4253960	And then what else was – oh, NintendoManiac64 says a Classic controller is needed for Super
4253960	4254960	Nintendo games.
4254960	4257840	I'd agree with that, because the GameCube had that funky layout for the buttons.
4257840	4259040	I beg to differ.
4259040	4261960	You don't – you use the GameCube controller on Super Nintendo games?
4261960	4264640	The Hori pad.
4264640	4268920	Hori made a GameCube controller that was in the Super Nintendo layout.
4268920	4271400	Oh, so you're not really using a GameCube controller.
4271400	4272400	I get it.
4272400	4273400	Okay.
4273400	4276280	If you're using a Classic controller, you've still got another way to do it.
4276280	4277280	Okay.
4277280	4278280	I didn't even think about a third party GameCube controller.
4278280	4281840	And the fact that the Hori pads came out in the U.S. at major retailers, so.
4281840	4284440	Oh, there you go.
4284440	4286080	Good insight, DarkSucker.
4286080	4287360	All right.
4287360	4290080	So what other games have you been playing on your Wii, Bryce?
4290080	4296680	I downloaded Super Mario Brothers and – what the hell else was the other one I downloaded?
4296680	4297680	I downloaded two of them.
4297680	4299680	Isn't it funny how you download all these games?
4299680	4300680	R-Type.
4300680	4304800	Are you going to download R-Type for Jamie?
4304800	4305800	She sends me the Wii points.
4305800	4306800	You know what?
4306800	4310600	I'll go get you a Wii card if you promise me the first thing you download is R-Type.
4310600	4311600	Oh, sure.
4311600	4314000	You send me a Wii card, I'll download anything you want.
4314000	4319520	Just wait until after I make my next school payment and I'll do it.
4319520	4320520	Wow.
4320520	4321520	Look at this, guys.
4321520	4322520	Call in tonight.
4322520	4323520	Jamie's giving away free Wii points.
4323520	4326920	Only to my fellow Whovian.
4326920	4329480	All right.
4329480	4330480	It's like a contest.
4330480	4333240	There's something nice about Dr. Who and Wii points.
4333240	4335800	Send those emails to mailbag at orangefundstradio.com.
4335800	4339400	I will send Wii points to whoever gets me a David Tennant signature.
4339400	4340400	How's that?
4340400	4341400	Oh, there you go.
4341400	4343480	Actually, I could just do that with an envelope, but still.
4343480	4345200	There you go.
4345200	4347240	Zappy in our chat says, I love Dr. Who.
4347240	4348240	Give me.
4348240	4349240	All right.
4349240	4350240	Brad, anything else on your mind tonight?
4350240	4351240	Yeah.
4351240	4353120	The DOA movie actually doesn't suck.
4353120	4354120	Really?
4354120	4356120	See, all I've heard is really negative things about it.
4356120	4360080	So what – now, I know you reviewed it on your own program, but in a nutshell, what
4360080	4362000	were your thoughts on it?
4362000	4365160	It's complete popcorn.
4365160	4368880	There's not a whole lot of – I mean, it's all substance, but are all –
4368880	4370200	All style, no substance?
4370200	4371200	Yeah.
4371200	4372200	Yeah.
4372200	4377520	Well, I mean, it's a fun summer movie kind of thing.
4377520	4379000	It's just fun.
4379000	4380000	It's not –
4380000	4384080	So it's like – it's one of those movies where, like, turn your brain off for two hours
4384080	4388160	and just kind of be a mindless zombie and it's not so bad?
4388160	4389160	Oh, yeah.
4389160	4390160	All right.
4390160	4391160	That's cool.
4391160	4392840	Why do you think it bypassed theaters?
4392840	4397760	I really don't know because I've paid 10 bucks to see movies that are 10 times worse
4397760	4399760	than that.
4399760	4400760	That's true.
4400760	4403820	I did pay to see Lady in the Water.
4403820	4406840	Did you have the life – or is it – I'm sorry.
4406840	4410440	Is it true in Dead or Alive movie that they have, like, life bars and the announcer in
4410440	4411440	it?
4411440	4412440	Yeah.
4412440	4414020	Was that – that sounds cheesy.
4414020	4415020	Was it cheesy?
4415020	4417680	It's very cheesy in some places, yeah.
4417680	4423160	Oh, well, I suppose you don't go see a Dead or Alive movie expecting Oscar-caliber Judi
4423160	4427540	Dench acting-in-it type content, although it would be kind of funny if Judi Dench was
4427540	4429280	in Dead or Alive, don't you think?
4429280	4430280	I don't –
4430280	4431280	What?
4431280	4432280	Forget it.
4432280	4433280	No.
4433280	4434280	Not funny.
4434280	4435280	All right.
4435280	4440800	Well, yeah, I hope they go to your program and check out the full review of Dead or Alive.
4440800	4441800	All right.
4441800	4442800	All right.
4442800	4443800	Well, Brad, thanks so much for calling in tonight.
4443800	4446160	We've got to go to another call, but take care, buddy, okay?
4446160	4447160	Later on, man.
4447160	4448160	Peace.
4448160	4449160	All right.
4449160	4452160	A little mini movie review here on Orange Launch Radio.
4452160	4453640	Let's go to one more call.
4453640	4454640	Hi.
4454640	4455640	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4455640	4456640	Who's this?
4456640	4457640	Hey.
4457640	4458640	Shadownextgen in chat.
4458640	4459640	Hi.
4459640	4460640	Shadownextgen in chat.
4460640	4461640	What's on your mind, buddy?
4461640	4466600	I apologize if you guys talked about this earlier as I was late to the show because
4466600	4467600	of the Super Bowl.
4467600	4468600	All right.
4468600	4470680	A lot of people have that excuse tonight, but try me.
4470680	4471680	What's up?
4471680	4477600	Do you guys have any idea about what Konami's, quote-unquote, earth-shattering news tomorrow
4477600	4480360	is going to be?
4480360	4481360	You know what?
4481360	4484840	We didn't bring this up, but I had read somewhere that they have earth-shattering
4484840	4485840	news coming on Monday.
4485840	4486840	It's on their own website.
4486840	4487840	Yeah.
4487840	4488840	They're advertising tomorrow.
4488840	4489840	Earth-shattering news.
4489840	4495400	And I saw that get picked up on Kotaku or Destructo or one of those sites.
4495400	4497920	No, because they didn't tell us what it is on Thursday.
4497920	4502240	I can guarantee you we talked earlier in the show about we weren't allowed to say some
4502240	4505800	things for some time, but I can guarantee you everything that we were allowed to say
4505800	4506800	has been said now.
4506800	4508880	Here's the earth-shattering news.
4508880	4512960	Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming soon.
4512960	4517880	I have a feeling it's probably about one of the games we didn't see, like where was
4517880	4519400	the Metal Gear Solid 4 info.
4519400	4520440	You know maybe that's it.
4520440	4524360	Maybe it's the Metal Gear Solid release date because don't you remember her saying
4524360	4527880	something like, well, we want to give you the release date, but can we do that?
4527880	4528880	No.
4528880	4530280	Didn't she kind of do that kind of thing?
4530280	4532840	Wasn't that how she was teasing the release date?
4532840	4536800	Or was she just smoking a bowl?
4536800	4541440	Doesn't she remind you just a little bit of what's-her-name from Nintendo, the parent
4541440	4542440	Kaplan or whatever?
4542440	4543440	I don't know.
4543440	4548160	But anyway, I would say if it's that earth-shattering, it's the Metal Gear Solid 4 release date,
4548160	4549880	new trailer, something like that.
4549880	4552240	Something that missed Konami Gamer's Day for whatever reason.
4552240	4561600	A lot of people are thinking it's maybe Konami's confirmation of MGS4 on the 360.
4561600	4567000	I have a feeling if that's going to happen, it's going to be a window where it's
4567000	4572320	going to be on the PS3 for six months and then it'll come out on the 360.
4572320	4574760	It might be like Virtua Fighter and just be Blade.
4574760	4578880	Yeah, that's essentially what I'm getting at is that it might be one of those things.
4578880	4582760	Because I'll tell you what, Sony needs that so bad right now.
4582760	4588520	And you can kind of tell that Konami's really backing the PSP more than almost anyone else.
4588520	4591600	Konami is doing what they can for Sony.
4591600	4595180	So they still are in the business of making money, but I have a feeling they're going
4595180	4596640	to give at least a window.
4596640	4599160	I would not expect that to be tomorrow's news.
4599160	4600160	But I could be wrong.
4600160	4601160	That could be it.
4601160	4604600	But I have a feeling you're going to get tomorrow the release.
4604600	4609320	Unless it's something stupid, like remember the time when the guy got a lot of crap for
4609320	4613840	this, but Joystiq had this big announcement at one o'clock about what Nintendo's doing.
4613840	4616480	Yeah, and it turned out to be just some chip thing.
4616480	4620120	If it's not something stupid like that, I would imagine it's the Metal Gear Solid
4620120	4621120	release date.
4621120	4622120	Oh my God.
4622120	4628400	Big kudos to the Rob D. Metal Gear Solid 4 will star Sub-Zero instead of Raiden.
4628400	4630040	I see what you did there.
4630040	4631040	Funny.
4631040	4634480	Well, what do you hope it is, Shadow Next Gen?
4634480	4638360	Personally, like I said, I'd like to see Metal Gear on the 360.
4638360	4641720	That would probably be for me.
4641720	4647360	That way, one less reason for me to shell out $600.
4647360	4650800	It would be bad news for Sony if that is what they announce tomorrow.
4650800	4653640	Do you think Sony ought to just throw in the towel at that point?
4653640	4659280	What can Sony do if they're about to lose Metal Gear Solid to the 360?
4659280	4660760	I really couldn't tell you.
4660760	4664960	Well, for one thing, they can start listening to their community like Microsoft does.
4664960	4665960	Good idea.
4665960	4671680	It seems like they keep telling us what we want instead of listening to what we want.
4671680	4672680	That is true.
4672680	4675460	They don't have anything quite like Major Nelson.
4675460	4676460	You got to give that to Microsoft.
4676460	4679840	I mean, Microsoft is by no means perfect, but at least they do have their outlet with
4679840	4680840	their community.
4680840	4684240	You got to admit, though, Nintendo doesn't really listen to people either, but somehow
4684240	4685240	they get away with it.
4685240	4689520	No, they don't, but I think they do a little bit better.
4689520	4691840	But yeah, they could do better in that area as well.
4691840	4696680	We seem to forgive Nintendo because they kind of at least deliver a little more than Sony
4696680	4699360	seems to have been recently, I think is what it comes down to.
4699360	4703600	Well, I think, personally, I think the reason why Sony has gotten so much f**k over the
4703600	4705820	past year is just their PR.
4705820	4709020	If they wouldn't have said half of their stupid comments, they'd probably be in a much better
4709020	4710020	position right now.
4710020	4711020	I would agree with you there.
4711020	4716160	Like the time when people will buy a PS3 even if there are no games for it.
4716160	4718080	I guess that's true.
4718080	4722160	Well, we will see what that announcement is, and we'll talk about it next week.
4722160	4725840	So shout out next year, and I'm hoping you'll call us back next week and let us know about
4725840	4726840	the news, whatever it is.
4726840	4727840	Yeah, all right.
4727840	4728840	Jump through, guys.
4728840	4729840	All right.
4729840	4730840	Take care, buddy.
4730840	4731840	Have a good one.
4731840	4732840	Yeah, you too.
4732840	4733840	Later.
4733840	4734840	That's going to do it for tonight's Skyline.
4734840	4737960	Thank you so much to all our people calling in, and I apologize if we didn't get to your
4737960	4738960	call.
4738960	4741880	We were getting hammered a lot there towards the end, but we just got to keep things moving.
4741880	4746800	We're running a little late tonight, so we are going to go ahead and start to wrap up
4746800	4747800	the show.
4747800	4748800	Any last minute stories, guys?
4748800	4749800	Yeah.
4749800	4750800	All right.
4750800	4751800	Yes, Loki.
4751800	4752800	A few things.
4752800	4753800	There's going to be a brand new wipeout.
4753800	4754800	I know.
4754800	4755800	This is a surprise.
4755800	4761480	Brand new wipeout coming to the PS3 and PSP, and it actually looks pretty good.
4761480	4765960	They have some screenshots up on that, you know, looks very similar to the other wipeout
4765960	4766960	games.
4766960	4772840	Apparently, Microsoft is bringing Project Silphied over here for Square Enix, so they're
4772840	4775000	going to be publishing it stateside.
4775000	4776000	So that's kind of cool.
4776000	4777480	I'm very much looking forward to that one.
4777480	4781560	So we'll see the next-gen shooter on 360 soon.
4781560	4786520	Rumors are that according to Famitsu, Resident Evil 5 is delayed to 2008.
4786520	4790120	I definitely believe that.
4790120	4791120	Let's see.
4791120	4797000	Another rumor here, and this apparently was actually coming from, I want to say Bungie.
4797000	4799840	Yeah, actually it was from their last Bungie update.
4799840	4804440	They were saying that you'll be able to modify the gravity in, I believe, multiplayer games,
4804440	4806840	so you can reduce the gravity to 50%.
4806840	4807840	Oh boy.
4807840	4808840	Jump even further.
4808840	4810360	Hooray for low gravity games.
4810360	4811360	You all know that's coming.
4811360	4815280	Can I give some quick chat room comments to the last phone call here?
4815280	4818560	NM64 says, Skye, I think Nintendo surprised their fans.
4818560	4820600	Sony tells fans what they want.
4820600	4824620	The Rob D says, that's because Nintendo doesn't act like arrogant jerks and piss all over
4824620	4826800	our memories when they don't listen to us.
4826800	4830760	Black Boy says, Nintendo totally doesn't listen to the consumers.
4830760	4831760	Let's see.
4831760	4836240	Hitstun says, Konami announces Boktai game for PS3, yeah.
4836240	4838200	You have to drag your PS3 out into the sun.
4838200	4840000	It might cook itself.
4840000	4847160	Bandit says, breaking news, Konami's tears can cure cancer, if only it was able to cry.
4847160	4848400	How random.
4848400	4850880	How ripped off from the Chuck Norris.
4850880	4851880	Yeah, I get it.
4851880	4852880	I get it.
4852880	4853880	Yeah.
4853880	4859340	Anyways, there was also another rumored list of titles coming out for the Wii.
4859340	4865600	This is supposedly from the new Game Pro issue, the March issue.
4865600	4871880	On the list, we have 100 Bullets, which is supposed to hit in the fall, Alive, which
4871880	4873440	is being done by Ubisoft.
4873440	4878240	Remember, that's that one girl game thing that's supposed to make you cry and stuff.
4878240	4879240	Oh, yes.
4879240	4880240	Oh, yes.
4880240	4882360	I remember that.
4882360	4885000	A new Devil Kings game, which is very similar.
4885000	4887640	It's Capcom's kind of Danksy Warriors type of game.
4887640	4894240	A new Digimon game, DK Bongo Blast, I guess, is now coming out for the Wii.
4894240	4896800	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, not a big surprise.
4896800	4900400	Iron Man the movie game coming out in 2008.
4900400	4904480	Kirby, a new Kirby game, 2007, I guess fall.
4904480	4907760	Legend of the Dragon, I know Legend of the Dragon is coming out.
4907760	4913040	Lost, they're supposed to be doing the game this year on that.
4913040	4918840	Ratatouille, I know that's coming out, and that's actually not fall listed on here.
4918840	4924720	Mario Kart for the Wii, Pilot Wings for the Wii, I don't believe that, but I guess we'll
4924720	4926040	see.
4926040	4932500	A new Wii shooting game and some new Wii Sports, Wii Motor Sports, they're going to have that
4932500	4935000	airplane game that was shown in E3.
4935000	4942240	Wii Music, which is supposed to come in October, TNA Impact, Jawa, which I have no idea what
4942240	4948600	that is, Space Station Tycoon, Dance Factory, Animal Crossing, Raid Over the River, which
4948600	4959640	actually looks pretty awesome, that's also coming out of the DS, and Sadness, we'll see.
4959640	4962880	Jamie's still on the Castlevania kick, and now she's trying to get me into it too.
4962880	4967280	Sorry, I found a YouTube thing where someone has uploaded apparently the entire run of
4967280	4968280	the game.
4968280	4971040	Real quick, because I know this makes for awesome radio, I wanted to show you, Rob,
4971040	4976480	a game I liked, I know you like Burnout, well this is another game, Flatout, they have the
4976480	4982920	first screenshots for Flatout Ultimate Carnage on xboxside.com, so I thought you might want
4982920	4986960	to check this out, because it looks very similar to Burnout, and it looks very good.
4986960	4988440	Wow, that's very pretty.
4988440	4991760	It's like Burnout, but you can launch your driver through the windshield.
4991760	4994160	That is great, I'm going to so play that.
4994160	4995160	Hooray.
4995160	4996160	Yeah.
4996160	5000640	Alright, any other last minute news, Loki, Dark Sakura, anyone?
5000640	5002600	Rondo of Blood is the best.
5002600	5003600	Really?
5003600	5004600	Yes.
5004600	5005600	I never knew.
5005600	5009160	I guess that means we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5009160	5012720	I do want to say this, I usually don't tease what's coming up next week on the program,
5012720	5017840	but next week, we have a juicy exclusive for you guys.
5017840	5022240	One of our listeners, and I trust this person, has laid eyes on the script for the Alice
5022240	5029880	movie, and we are going to be divulging a lot of details on the Alice movie that you're
5029880	5033980	not supposed to know about right here on the program next week, so stay tuned for that.
5033980	5035800	That's your teaser for next week.
5035800	5038440	In the meantime, that means that's it, end of show.
5038440	5041960	Thank you guys so much for tuning in, supporting independent radio, supporting Orange Launch
5041960	5042960	Radio.
5042960	5043960	You guys are awesome.
5043960	5044960	We love you to bits.
5044960	5046440	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5046440	5049140	Loki, your final thought tonight?
5049140	5053360	My final thought is I'm completely done with Microsoft's retail training.
5053360	5056440	At least I'm caught up.
5056440	5059920	By the way, chat room, yes, that is American McGee's Alice that we're talking about.
5059920	5061720	Dark Sakura, your final thought?
5061720	5069600	Richter Belmont, I'm sorry, Richter, I actually got a really freaking busy week ahead of me,
5069600	5074840	so just, I need energy.
5074840	5078480	My final thought is I want ice cream so bad right now, it hurts.
5078480	5080000	I have ice cream.
5080000	5082160	I want Baskin-Robbins or Cold Stone or something.
5082160	5084240	I'm never eating it in and out again, by the way.
5084240	5085240	Why?
5085240	5086240	Did you read the nutritional content?
5086240	5087240	Yes.
5087240	5089120	Yeah, that's a good way to stop eating fast food like ever again.
5089120	5094160	I love their fries, the 400 calories for all those tasty, beautiful potatoes.
5094160	5097560	I can just make them at home in the oven and then they're like 200.
5097560	5098560	All right.
5098560	5100360	You're going to cut up a potato and put it in the oven?
5100360	5101360	Yeah, I could do that.
5101360	5102360	That's not bad.
5102360	5103360	All right.
5103360	5104360	That's it, folks.
5104360	5106960	We'll be back next week with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
5106960	5109880	Until then, hugs and kisses from us to you.
5109880	5110880	Take care.
