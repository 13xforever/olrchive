Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
This is episode number 218 for this, February the 4th of 2007.
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
Yo.
How you doing, Jamie Summers?
I'm doing.
Yeah?
Been an interesting week.
Been an interesting week? Yeah, I could say the same.
It's been a very interesting week. We'll get into that in a minute.
Say hello as well though to Tech Master Loki.
Hello.
How you doing, Loki?
I'm doing good.
Did you have an interesting week as well?
Yes.
Alright.
Well, for those of you that are new to our program, we just want to say hello and welcome.
We were lucky enough to have a story of ours on the front page of DIG this week.
So we're thinking we might have got a couple new people thanks to that.
So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a big howdy hello to you.
Thank you for choosing to support independent podcasting, first off.
And just so you know, we're a show made up of three friends who have kind of become friends to each other just through doing this program.
We sit here and we talk about games every week and the way that you would sit down and talk at a dinner after you've gone to an arcade from a long night of playing DDR or Tekken or Derby Owners Crack, whatever it is that you play at the arcade.
Just kind of sitting around and chatting like old friends.
And sometimes we're lucky enough to break news here first because we have some inside contacts thanks to Loki being in the distribution world, among other things.
But sometimes we're not always going to break the news.
We're just going to talk about it and give you our viewpoints on it.
We're dedicated to giving every gamer a voice and we do that partially through our chat room as well.
A big hello to the chat room.
Joining us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com when we tape live here on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
Also we have our Skype line which we'll open up later in the program. It's also an 800 number you can give us a call at and share your thoughts.
We'll open that up later.
So that way all you guys have a voice.
All right.
And of course tonight they're talking a little bit in chat room about the Super Bowl which is going on right now.
But I guess between the three of us we kind of don't really keep tabs on what's going on in the Super Bowl.
But I will say the Puppy Bowl was awesome and I'm kind of sad I missed the kitty half time.
But the Puppy Bowl is kind of boring.
But the Puppy Bowl is cute because they have the bowl.
I like the bowl cam.
You know what? They need like a Madden for puppies.
Would you buy Puppy Bowl the game?
There was a Japanese TV show that I used to have a few copies of on tape.
It was called Uri Nari Land and they had dog soccer and baby soccer and cow soccer.
The closest I've come is Mega Man soccer I'm sorry to say.
I was thinking the Puppy Bowl would be something like that and it wasn't.
It was cute but it was just three hours of cuteness.
Puppies playing.
I was sitting in here working on some last minute things for the show
and I just hear out in the living room dark soccer and my roommate going.
That was your roommate that was not me.
No it was you.
Puppies.
It was both of you.
All right, well let's get into the game stuff.
I was on my ass in this chair, playing Tech in Dark Resurrection on PSP, and I'm gonna
get Dancing Blade, because I played the old one, and that was pretty cool.
I actually did not play any Cooking Mama this week.
Are you in a 12-step recovery program?
No, I'm in a, oh my god, my midterms are next week type of thing, so I've been studying
muscle groups.
Well, I guess if I went back and played some Trauma Center, I'd be okay for class or something.
I loaned out my copy of Trauma Center to a friend of mine who just got a Wii, so I'm
sorry to say I don't have my version for you to practice on, but that's a fun game.
So fun.
I like the Trauma Center.
I've actually gotten pretty good at some of it, but it's still frustrating.
Can't I just rub them until they're better?
So yeah.
That's really doing it though.
Alright.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
I played more of the Crackdown demo, like, another three or four times yesterday.
I love that game.
I just can't wait for the full thing to come out.
You know, it's one of those games that I was like, well, you know, because everyone was
saying, oh, it's kind of the demo, they didn't like the demo or anything like that originally
when I was first hearing about it.
I was kind of like, well, you know, I don't know if I'm gonna like this.
I actually like it better because you can actually explore a lot more of the city.
I did climb to the top of the tower in the middle of the city, which is fun, difficult,
and a little bit, you know, a little bit frustrating at times because, you know, if you fall off
that thing, you're pretty dead because you're falling like 50 stories, but it's cool because
once I climbed to the top and I had like 10 seconds left, I jumped to my death trying
to land on another cop because that was funny, but yeah, it was great.
And then I tried out another demo, actually NBA Street Home Court, a little bit different
of a type of game that I'd normally play, but it's pretty cool.
It actually looks really good.
All the screenshots are definitely pretty accurate of how the game is.
It's pretty cool, kind of reminds me of NBA Jam a little bit because, you know, the players
are doing stuff that you would normally not see anyone doing in basketball, but it's pretty
fun.
It's not a game I'd be picking up, but, you know, definitely a fun game.
I really wish NBA Jam would just come back, you know, because NFL Blitz is kind of lame.
You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but NBA Jam was definitely one I could get
into.
That game was a lot of fun.
It really was.
I just love the old NFL Blitz, but this Blitz League shit's retarded.
Some comments from chat room regarding your comments on Crackdown.
Jeremy Todd 1 says, the grenade launcher in the Crackdown demo is so freaking awesome,
you can literally just keep blowing everyone up with a single button push.
Flying flaming people equals automatic 10 out of 10 score.
Mr. Gohan wants to know, how did you get up there?
Jeremy How'd I get up there?
Climbing.
Seriously, it's just climbing, you know.
If you keep climbing up the side of the building, you'll eventually get to this part where it's
kind of flat, then on one of the ends of the three towers, they have, like, scaffolding.
If you jump on the scaffolding, you can kind of make your way up a little bit more, but
you really need to have, like, you know, at least a third level on your, you know, jumping
and stuff in order to be able to reach some of that, but you can get pretty high.
It's pretty fun, and it's even more amazing, too, when you get that high, you can still
see all the cars and people walking down below.
I mean, that's pretty amazing, you know, compared to, like, Saints Row, which, you know, you
wouldn't see any of that stuff, stuff would be glitching out and stuff, but I can't wait.
I can't wait for Saints Row 2 whenever the hell that comes out.
Crackdown!
That's going to hold me over for a long time.
Hold you over until what?
Oh, Grand Theft Auto?
Is that what you're waiting for?
Oh, yeah, Grand Theft Auto IV.
Anything else?
No, actually, oh, I played Luminous a little bit, I beat some, I got some more achievements
playing the time attack stuff, and I think that's all I played, yeah, that's it.
Alright, well, my gaming week wasn't too thrilling because I'm still in my World of War Crack
mode, so I'm still playing there with the guild, which, by the way, if you're interested
in joining our guild, we have a few OLR listeners in there that I've been playing with and chatting
with, it's fun.
I was just on there about an hour before we went live tonight, and if you want to join,
there's more information on our forums, it's orangeonsready.com, click on forums, right
now we play on the Ravencrest server on the Horde side, for the Horde, anyway, it's fun.
So a lot of people are making their Blood Elves over there because it's a newer server.
But anyway, outside of War Crack, not a whole lot of other games per se, but I did finally
check out Xbox 360's movie marketplace, because when it first launched, there was really nothing
I wanted to see, but then they added a bunch of Lionsgate movies just like a week and a
half ago, it's kind of like the artsy, well, sometimes, sometimes they have big budget
films like Saw, and I guess The Descent was kind of up there, but usually it's like kind
of artsy films.
So there was a film on there that one of my friends had seen that said I'd probably like
called Hard Candy, which I decided to download in HD, just because I wanted to see how was
the HD delivery and everything, and well, the movie itself was kind of weird, I mean,
I guess it was good for like the first 40 minutes, then it was just like WTF, it was
kind of gross, but anyway, outside the movie, I mean, I realized that Microsoft can't do
anything about that, the quality wasn't too bad, I thought it was kind of weird, because
when you first start watching the movie, it actually continues to download the last portion
of the movie, so you can't really rewind or fast forward or any of that stuff for the
first little bit of the movie until I was about an hour in, then it finally finished
downloading the rest of the movie, so I could rewind, fast forward, whatever, and basically,
once you download the movie to your hard drive, you have 14 days to start watching it, and
then, once you press the play button and start watching it, you have 24 hours to finish it,
which you know, if I'm going to sit down and watch a movie, that was certainly ample time
for me to finish it, but just so you know before you download any of that stuff, picture
quality because I downloaded an HD was pretty good I don't know if HD gives me
anything that much more than DVD does I mean yeah it's a little crisper yeah the
colors stick out a little more but is it worth essentially six dollars that I'm
paying to download the HD movie to watch one time I don't know I don't know I
might be better off just getting the HD DVD player and getting a Netflix I don't
know yet so it's hard to tell too because hard candy wasn't exactly a movie
with lots of bang up special effects and things it would be easier maybe if I
downloaded something like Poseidon that might have more of that I don't know but
it wasn't bad I would use the service again because at least it wasn't having
the slowdown problems that the store did when it first launched whatever I guess
maybe the curiosity factor is settled down a lot and things it's easier to get
in there and download movies now so I I would recommend if there's a movie on
there that interests you you want to see how it looks download one try it for
yourself why not I also downloaded for free because it was for free for a
couple days the first episode of the Sarah Silverman program which is
hilarious but the audio is off a little bit as it because we also take my
roommate taped it on the DVR and then I was like oh we can download it'll be
like perfect quality and while the video quality was great the sound was off I
don't know if that was me or what the hell was going I don't mean the sound
was muted but the sound was like you know when the sound is like just a hair
off of the lips it just bugs the hell out of you because it looks like you're
watching an old karate movie or something yeah yeah it's bad so maybe
it's just my copy of it I don't know whatever going to the chat room and
seeing what the folks are saying there in the chat room let's see black boy
says God Shelley winters in HD no not that not the old ass Poseidon adventure
I mean the new one who then what the new one have in it it had was that guy it's
in them got it can you remember his name who's the guy that's a snake in revenge
of New York or whatever oh that's carousel carousals in it that's what it
is Mike W says that Rob is a movie snob yeah maybe a little bit I don't know
Mike W says Rob like only plays Xbox Live Arcade yeah lately that's what I've
been playing there hasn't been a whole lot released on discs that I've wanted
to play but I enjoyed heavy weapon I love luminous I love the Xbox Live
Arcade it's like those little little throwaway games with a little like
because I have gamer a DD if you've lived in the show long enough you know
that I never stick with one game for a long time with the exception of the few
MMOs I've played and even then I quit and go back and quit and go back all the
time so Xbox Live Arcade games are perfect for me but I do want to check
out fusion frenzy which is kind of the same thing it's like 40 minigames in one
but it's an actual release game as opposed to Xbox Live Arcade and I'm
definitely looking forward to some of the Xbox Live Arcade news we have coming
later in the show but first we're gonna get into the show tonight we have a no
housekeeping news of notes there's no changes or anything going on with the
show so we'll just take this opportunity to give a few of our other projects a
few plugs we want to say you can catch us on all games radio if you want to

and dark soccer are up there too not me not you why aren't you participating in
the forums you hypocrite I'm not a hypocrite I'm babysitting I see all
right well let's get into some gaming news and we're gonna start it off as I
mentioned at the top of the show we were very lucky to have our coverage of dance
dance revolution hottest party hit dig this week so thank you guys very much
for giving us a dig on there and as we reported we were lucky enough to attend
Konami gamers day earlier this week and we'll tell you more about it throughout
the rest of the show here but of course you know since our show started many
years ago as a Bamani DDR music game type station we know a lot of our
longtime fans are very interested in this title and heck even some of you
guys who've come to listen to Orange Lounge Radio when we just tapped into
gaming in general you still can understand the dance dance revolution is
really up there it's the top if not one of the top maybe next to guitar here I
don't know music game franchises that people really follow so I think a lot of
people expected the DDR was going to come to the Wii it was just a matter of
time I don't know about you I wasn't expecting to hear it this early like I
kind of thought we would see it maybe like doesn't seem still early in the
Wii's life for us to be getting this game I don't know maybe maybe so I was
surprised at the timing of it I thought we wouldn't hear anything about it till
at least e3 if not 2008 but it looks like we are getting it this year at
least a cool point because it's not gonna be another PlayStation 2 version
this year I would think I don't know they didn't show one off so that would
that would imply that but I don't know there's a lot of stuff they didn't show
off economy gamers day so they didn't say anything about Metal Gear Solid 4
except kind of cock tease us with a release date and then not say anything
that was stupid they knew they knew me soon I was like that's such a they knew
we all wanted to know it they didn't say anything about Silent Hill origins I'm
wondering if that game got cancelled cuz coding on it's still it's still like
it's pushed back that's for sure Silent Hill now Silent Hill 5 was the game I
was thinking we were gonna see I cuz you know though we're gonna get a Silent
Hill 5 at some point the first four games are phenomenal there's the movie
and everything duh we have to get a Silent Hill 5 at some what nothing I
think economy gamers dating up about Silent Hill 5 doesn't that make you sad
dark soccer because I was looking forward to Silent Hill 5 not really why
because that sort might leave it to a much bigger announcement coming up later
ah so you think Silent Hill 5 is worthy of a press conference all on its own why
not okay fair enough maybe when they announce the sequel to the movie I don't
know well anyway a three new songs in DDR hottest party lips of an angel gonna
make you sweat and will buy a Naoki what's interesting with that is that the
teaser trailer teased that it was a brand new soundtrack from the ground up
and so it's kind of interesting because you have this lips of names are gonna
be sweat and then there was a weird cover of breakdown in there yes I
remember both of myself and Mel B we right when the trailer annual that was a
really weird version of that song it's like what the fuck was that and they
talk about a soundtrack spanning four decades worth of music so I'm wondering
if this isn't kind of like the direction we're gonna see for the soundtrack an
all-new soundtrack of like remade songs of the last four decades along with a
few economy originals like this will bow Naoki
uh-huh we'll see it was interesting a little demo now of course it's on the
ween you gotta wonder how's the Wii remote gonna be used and yes you use the
Wii remote in the game they add a little basically I think this is more of a
concept build what we were looking at at this at the show because it basically
looked like DDR supernova but blue and then like every so often an arrow would
be replaced with this little icon that kind of looked like the Wiimote and then
uncheck the other cause symbol kinda it looked kind of weird and you that was
just your indication of shake you could do anything you want but they were very
I mean Jason Enos who's like the producer for this that was there demo in
the game and he said this is he emphasized over and over again this is a
very early concept thing we just want people to know it's coming we're still
really experimenting with what the we thing is going to do by the way I want
to mention something I didn't post anywhere on the site since Jason Enos
was there I took an opportunity to ask him a couple questions and I asked him I
said so how about DDR in the arcade and anything you want to say about DDR in
the arcade and he of course didn't really have anything to say I said what
about that rumor there's an expansion coming to supernova with you know the
20 30 20 30 or more songs he said he didn't know anything about it which
could be the polite way of saying no comment I don't know but rest assured
those rumors that you've seen floating around the other DDR sites Jason says
you don't know about it so that's what I'm going with I'll trust him that's
interesting that is I was reading there's some rumored release dates and I
haven't heard anything about this yet but that was it that stupid Codemasters
dance factory game was gonna be coming to the Wii in March before DDR oh
interesting but I mean I can tell you right now the games could be ass just
because the last one is ass I'm looking at some comments from chat room Jeremy
Todd once says Silent Hill origins is now the next Duke Nukem forever god I
hope not jaded says Silent Hill there won't be a five I doubt that those those
are big where there's got four sold pretty well didn't it I'll see why there
wouldn't be a five all right Rama says DDR supernova 2 in the groove dream on
dream I'm sorry I've been following the Bahmani scene for a long time in the
groove songs are not is not coming to DDR and I I don't I don't have any
insider knowledge to back that up granted but just having followed Konami
in the biases as long as I have it's not happening stop getting your hopes up
about it because you're gonna be disappointed I'm sorry not happening
once that ruling passed in the groove was officially dead so anyway that away
from that back to DDR on the week that's what we really want to talk about yeah
what I thought was interesting is the selection screen you could use the Wii
remote to like point-and-click at songs you wanted to play and it had a cute
little DDR arrow icon I don't know just it's a long memory right now yeah I'm
sure I'm sure what did you think look because you actually got to play it what
did you think actually playing the game did it feel right was it weird it was
like DDR hands and feet mode but it's just it's it let me put it this way the
hands and feet mode was awkward this is just as equally as awkward at least as
it is right now and it's not it's just it doesn't it's almost like it doesn't
need to be there just because you know you supported the iToy you don't need to
have a hands and feet mode in that although the thing is though if they do
something like this they could do some really interesting stuff with it like
instead of you know have a whole section of the song that's all done with your
hands I mean that might be kind of cool that's what Jason was kind of implying
that they might want to do things where you do different motions like he
referenced Saturday Night Fever like the disco pose like there might be a symbol
that you have to do that kind of pose and that they could do like what was in
a samba de amigo that and that's what a lot of people are coming away from the
saying is that it sounds like it could be DDR mixed with samba de amigo and I
don't see any reason why that's not a possibility so I mean it right now it's
just it's still way too early it is and you know that there's DDR with possible
stuff I was able when I played it I thought it was it did feel like it
played a lot like hands and feet mode because none of this extra stuff was in
there but I felt it was a lot cleaner because the problem I have with the
itoy is the device just sucks yeah if you're not in the exact right lighting
it doesn't win that's not Konami's fault it's just the itoy sucks I'm sorry I've
not played one good thing with the itoy not one and you have to have the exact
right lighting to make it work and it never is right on DDR I don't know if
you have a house where you can get it to work every time but the nice thing about
playing this on the Wii was that it worked every time like it you you know
it you don't have to have the perfect white background in your house to get
the wiimote shaking to pick up so that's what I liked about it is that and it
didn't matter where my hands or feet where I could kind of do it wherever so
that was kind of fun so I I had fun with it and it certainly posed to I mean I
was struggling on medium level difficulty songs you know so it
certainly adds a whole new challenge to it which I'm sure the purists will not be
happy about but DDR needs to evolve I did find it interesting though that all
the dance pads were just the GameCube dance pads I think you know in speculating
that DDR was going to come out on the Wii I wondered how they were gonna do
the wireless pad without lag and it never occurred to me duh just use the
GameCube pads because there's GameCube controllers on the thing and looks like
that's what they're doing because that's what in the trailer you could see
clearly that even the non Mario pads they use in the trailer were just plug
in yeah the GameCube slots anyway just really quite wanted to quickly say about
DDR Wii before we move on also it's going to feature an updated battle mode
a support mode where I know they talked about they really want this to be the
family DDR they want this to be the game that mom dad kid brother sister all play
together and they they're gonna have a mode in this where you actually talk to
each other and you have to do the same pose at a certain part in the song they
know they want that in one type of mode so you have to communicate with each
other say okay we're gonna disco we're gonna disco whoa we're gonna sprinkler
Roger Rabbit I don't know whatever so that's gonna be interesting I think if
nothing else now also free play mode and work workout mode no sign of edit mode
but I don't see how you couldn't have a DDR right now without edit mode so I
don't see why that wouldn't be coming for those that want to edit the Wii
things into it yeah it's way early it's probably just a technical issue for
right now so if you want to see more on it we even have some pictures we took
some pictures of the trailer which hasn't come out anywhere else yet and
there's a picture behind the scenes there you can see Jason a demoing it
for some girl from some unknown press site who's giggling over it you see all
that on our site and we have the only picture of the interface as it is now
but that's going to change the interface is going to change that was obviously a
temporary interface but that's all at orange lounge radio.com if you want to
see more information on that so Loki what what else did you see economies
gamers say that you enjoyed there's actually quite a few games there and I
got to try a little bit of everything one of the first games I tried was time
ace which in the preview kind of reminded me of time pilot because you're
playing in kind of different time periods and you're flying planes and
stuff the game itself actually reminded me the graphics remind me of prop cycle
I don't know if you remember that old arcade game I freaking love prop cycle
that's like one of the most underrated arcade games ever it reminded me very
much of that it weren't you big on prop cycle Jamie I remember you looked at an
M car K when it came out yeah the prop cycle is a bomb and you fan yourself I
played it for free I love so much anyway sorry anyways but on the game kind of
reminds me of at least the level that they had you try out where you kind of
playing this biplane thing to be honest the game itself could very much be wing
island on the DS I mean you're just you know doing different missions you're
fighting you know planes in the air I mean it seemed pretty solid you know
graphics are a bit rough but I guess that's you know that's just a DS for you
what is it you were saying something about you thought this was a sequel to
time pilot I thought it was a sequel to time pilot that's I mean it makes it
time ace time pilot meaning both of them are biplane games where you're fighting
in different you know time periods it seems logical to me and interesting I
just know I for some stupid reason to not make that connection I don't know I
just thought that's you know what they were doing I could be wrong they could
just be kind of a something that's almost identical and has almost the same
name whatever another game I did play though was coded arms contagion for the
PSP and I can tell you having played the first one it still sucks and you know
it's very unfortunate because it looks like they really tried to make the game
load better it's just unfortunately for the PSP first-person shooters just suck
on the PSP and that's just because they don't have two analog sticks it's really
hard it's real sluggish to move around if maybe if they increase how fast you
turn and stuff in it might be a little bit better but it's just those four face
buttons using as like a second analog stick it's just not good at all that's
really unfortunately a problem with the system but you know the game itself
looks pretty good I mean it's okay I just I didn't have very much fun with it
but you know what can you what can you say yes if you're used to playing you
know first-person shooters on the PSP then great maybe one to check out
definitely a good thing that they didn't do the random levels like they did the
first one but it kind of reminds me like a Metroid Prime type game Dewey's
adventure I know we saw the video of that looked okay kind of reminded me of
Kirby a little bit actually reminded me of one of their own titles it reminded
me of the Koron Koron I can't say that Korin pa Korin pa I can't say that word
it reminded me of Korin pa kind of like in the way that you tilted the
environment around but yet with this additional angle of changing the
temperatures to change Dewey from a liquid to a solid and from a solid to a
gas and what were they saying something about like when he's in solid form he
damages enemies more but he's more difficult to control when he's in liquid
form he can't really damage enemies but he's easier to control and then when
he's in gas form he just kind of goes wherever he just but he can't really do
anything else it's very interesting the way you change temperature and it's
supposed to change the environments completely so it's a nice thing you can
actually shake the controller certain ways to you know cause earthquakes or to
like cause wind and stuff like that so that's kind of unique for a platform
game.
When they were about to announce Dewey�s Adventure and they were showing the trailer
and everything and they didn�t tell us what the name of it was yet, didn�t you think
we were about to see Elibits 2?
I totally thought that�s what was coming.
The cut scene for the artwork is exactly the same.
It�s the same style, they got the same people that did all the arts in Elibits to do this
game.
It even had glowing creatures that were small.
All they�re doing is remaking Elibits all over again.
But then when we actually heard about the concept, it was nothing like Elibits at all.
No, it�s not.
But I kind of thought it would be interesting to keep it in the same universe but just have
it be a different thing, because it�s almost like the same art style.
I could see it later on, they�re having a box set from this guy, it�s like a bunch
of different stories that are kind of in the same universe because they all seem to be
told the same way with really bad dialogue over the entire cut scene.
It was cute.
It was cute.
But yeah, it was okay.
There are tsunami props for original stuff with that in Elibits and everything.
How easy would it have been to have just ported Castlevania to the Wii where you use the Wii
as the whip?
Whoopee-doo!
But they�re coming up instead with original things for the Wii, which I think is kind
of cute.
But I want a Castlevania game where you use the Wii as the whip.
I know we all want that.
We don�t need it right now.
We have this other Castlevania thing to look forward to we�re going to talk about in
a minute.
We don�t need another 3D Castlevania though.
That�s true.
Castlevania 64 still burns a little bit.
Hey now, we have 3D Castlevanias that aren�t that bad.
But they�re not that good either.
Castlevania 64 made my soul cry.
Compared to Symphony of the Night, everything since looks like poop.
I�m sorry.
No, no, no.
Compared to freaking Rondo of Blood, everything is poop.
We�ll get there in a minute, sweetie.
We�ll get there in a minute.
I know.
Well, Symphony of the Night was great, but it wasn�t a true Castlevania in my opinion.
It was like Metroid featuring�
Then fart in words.
Then fart in words.
Then fart in words.
It was Metroid featuring the Castlevania characters.
I�m not saying it was a bad game.
It�s one of my favorites ever, but it was Metroid featuring Castlevania characters.
But it was the best thing I�ve ever played, one of the best games I�ve ever played in
my life.
And granted, I think the best video game ever made.
I don�t know how many times I�ve said this on the show, but I think the greatest
video game of all time is Super Metroid.
Dude, Metroidvania.
And so of course I love Symphony of the Night.
Junami said it best, though.
Metroidvania.
Whatever.
Anyway.
Anyway, so another game that wasn�t like Metroid, Hellboy, was actually pretty cool.
It�s kind of a beat-em-up type of game, of course, based on the Hellboy comic.
It looks really good from what I�ve seen so far, and they had one level that they were
demoing there at the moment.
And it was kind of cool.
Definitely a lot of detail in there, and it�s kind of cool you can go around ripping heads
off of little demons and throw them at them and stuff like that, and the entire environment
was pretty destructible.
So I think it definitely looks like a better game, definitely a lot better than their last
brawler that came out, so it should be good.
The other one, Wing Island.
Wing Island on the Wii actually could very well be a sister game to Pilotwings.
It pretty much is Pilotwings from what I�ve seen, and also once again kind of the same
art style as Prop Cycle.
Very simple graphics, but it�s fun.
You play a squadron of biplanes and you get a bunch of different missions from finding
lost cows to delivering goods to putting out fires and stuff like that.
So definitely kind of the same feel as a Pilotwings game.
I�m looking at chat trying to answer some questions.
Travis Donovan for Prez in �08 asks, �How did Rob get an Elibit for his 360 Gamer picture?�
You�re seeing a lot of people on Xbox do this now, and it�s all thanks to the Xbox
Webcam, and the way I got an Elibit is that I got one of the little stuffed Elibits from
GameStop even though I didn�t pre-order the game, but I got that and I just put it
up against a white background and took a picture with the Xbox Cam, because you can do custom
gamer pics with the Xbox Live Webcam.
I saw somebody else on my friend�s list, I want to say Rob Way or one of our listeners
has like a glowing Wii logo as his gamer picture.
A lot of people are doing cute things like that.
For a while I had a Mario Kart as my background because you can import themes from pictures
on your computer, so you can do fun little customizable things with your 360 that kind
of make you go, �What?�
I haven�t bothered.
I just have a perfect dark.
That�s fine.
And the one that the public sees, because you only see the camera pictures if you�re
on the friend�s list, but what do I have?
I think I just have one of the Pac-Man ghosts or something.
I change it almost all the time.
I change it like every week.
It�s like my MySpace.
You got to change it all the time to keep it current.
Rob, look.
What?
Oh, you have Pac-Man background on your phone.
That�s cute.
It was a downloadable thing.
Did you pay money for that?
Yeah.
I was bored.
Loser.
When I�m bored, I buy stuff.
All right.
Like most women.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
You�re mad because it�s true.
Can you stop that right now?
Hey, hey, hey.
Yikes.
I just got a bottle thrown at me.
You bitch.
All right.
Rob.
Rob Hart.
Bleeding.
It bleeds for you.
Bleeding black deafness from your heart.
All right.
Anyway, let�s talk about Castlevania.
This is something Jamie and I can agree on.
They showed Castlevania the Dracula X Chronicles for the PSP.
It�s going to be our first Castlevania game that we have on the PSP.
What�s interesting is that elements of it are new, but it�s still kind of an old game.
Basically, what the Dracula X Chronicles are is that you�re going to have this old game,
Rondo of Blood, which they said has never been in the U.S. before.
Never.
It hasn�t, but I can�t stop thinking about Castlevania V. Even though that game was ass,
I mean, really, that game was like the worst Castlevania game they ever made next to 64.
Well, yeah, but in Japan�
Actually, I would rather play Castlevania 64 than Castlevania V.
In Japan, by the way, it was released as Dracula XX.
Right.
Well, so they kind of�
Or death�
Or death, but I mean, after you got past the first stage, a lot of it was different, so
it wasn�t really the same game, but in a way, it was.
But anyway�
I�m watching the trailer.
That�s as much as we got of Rondo of Blood previously.
Well, now we are going to get not only the classic Rondo of Blood game on the PSP, but
they�re redoing it with Upped Graphics, and that�s what they showed�
Oh, this is sexy.
I know.
That�s what they showed at the show.
I�m watching IGNs.
The whole first stage was playable, so we got to play that, and it was awesome.
Now, the thing you have to remember about Rondo of Blood is since�
Did we redo the intro?
Yes.
It�s all CG.
But is it still in Gothic German?
Yes.
I think so.
That thought.
I think.
It was hard to hear sound in there, but I think.
Well, you remember, though, the show where I brought in my turbo duo and hooked it up
and played it on air.
That was in like 2003 or 2004.
It was a long time ago.
Yeah, that was a few years ago.
Yeah, I remember that.
I�ll bring it back one day.
But yeah, it was a sexy game.
It looks great.
I love, love, love the 2D with the 3D look.
I mean, the best thing I could compare it to is like if you�ve played Super Smash
Brothers Melee and you�ve played that mode where you like actually are in the Mario game,
but it�s like all 3D-ified even though it�s 2D, that�s what they did to Rondo of Blood
in this enhanced mode.
It�s great.
Okay, instant impressed points for me.
The game mechanics are the same as 2D.
Yeah, you can do the back flip.
Not just that.
I was checking the timing of the moves.
They�re exactly the same as the PC engine.
It did play a little weird from the Castlevania games I�m used to, but I understand that�s
because the controls handled a little different back then.
Also something you have to remember, since this was before Castlevania the Night, you
cannot just go anywhere you want.
It�s a little more like Castlevania 3 kind of with the branching.
You can kind of branch off in different directions, but that�s about it.
Well, the whole point of the different directions, and I think that for people who aren�t familiar
with Rondo of Blood, is that your ending is affected by how you play the game.
You�ve got secret hidden parts.
For example, a lot of people were wondering who Maria was, who didn�t know any better.
She was actually playable in Rondo of Blood if you rescued her, and all of her attacks
were kind of stupid and cutesy little girly attacks, but they were also based after the
four gods of Chinese mythology, which I thought was pretty funny.
Oh, they redid the graphics for the Uber attacks in this game, too.
Oh, yeah.
It�s nice.
When you play the Saturn version, though, she has the same attacks, only just on a grander
scale.
Symphony of the Night will also be included.
That�s why this is the Dracula X Chronicles, so you get two versions of Rondo of Blood
and Symphony of the Night for one game, and that�s pretty awesome.
Now, they�re not redoing the graphics for Symphony of the Night, but they tease the
idea that they might add new areas.
They�re thinking about going back and retooling that game, and I�m theorizing, why not give
us the Saturn version?
I mean, I realize you can�t really port the Saturn, but give us what the Saturn version
had with Maria and that whole scenario.
That would be awesome.
Or the extra familiars.
For America, it would be an addition, because of course we didn�t get the Saturn version,
and as for the extra familiars, they were useless.
They took them out for a reason, and I�m pretty glad that they did, because they were
stupid.
All it was was another one of the same thing that you already had.
Dude, the item crash is hot.
Ravens Dolphin says, �I thought Dark Sakura would be more excited about this.� Okay,
when she first found out, I think I had to hold the phone about 10 inches away from my
ear, because I was going deaf from the squeaking.
Seriously, when I was watching the trailer, I sat there and actually thought to myself,
�Jamie�s going to piss herself.� I mean, literally, because if you�ve listened to
this show ever since Episode One, Jamie never shuts up about Rondo of Blood, and what a
great game it is.
It�s my copy while we were doing the show, remember?
I do.
Because I had gone to Anime Expo, and to put the long story short, my friend Krista owed
us money for our hotel room, so she came back from Japan with a copy of Dracula X for me
and called it even.
She owed us about $120 and gave us the game.
There you go.
So I have a pretty copy of the game.
Oh my God, this is so hot.
All right, we've got to get to some other games real quick, though, that I got to play.
Honeycomb Beat was another game I played on the DS.
What I like about this puzzle game is it�s kind of different from anything I�ve played.
It�s not like anything on PopCap.
It uses a stylus.
Basically the grid looks like there�s a puzzle mode and a progressive, you know, lines
going up the screen mode.
And basically when you tap the DS stylus on the screen, you flip over all the honeycombs
around the one that you hit, and so that�s kind of like how the puzzle works.
You�re trying to make lines of solid colors.
So it�s one of those easy concept but repeat playability.
Unfortunately there was no sound, so it�s hard for me to judge, like, does it have good
music?
I mean, is this game called Honeycomb Beat?
But it doesn�t really look like the music plays into it at all.
I think beat is just what they call tapping the screen to flip all the things over.
But I think if the price is right on this game, it could be a really good value buy,
I think.
It�s a good solid puzzle game that�s something we haven�t played before.
What�s also going to be a good value is Konami Classics.
The full name of this game on the Nintendo DS is Konami Classics Series Arcades Hits,
but we�ll just call it Konami Classics.
It�s 15 arcade games.
Essentially it�s MAME on your DS.
I don�t know a better way to describe it.
Contra, Gradius, Circus Charlie, Puyan, like all these really, just frankly some obscure
games.
I remember Puyan because it was a game I played on the Commodore 64.
But get this, all the actions on the top screen, but when you pause the game or you tap things
on the bottom screen, not only does the bottom screen show you like the old arcade how to
play banners, which I think is great, like those old things you used to see, like when
you press the button, your thing will fly or whatever it is.
You can also flip the top screen so that you can play in like brain training style mode,
you know, where you�re holding the DS vertically.
So for a more vertically oriented game like Puyan, it works great because you don�t
really stretch the screen like you do if you�re trying to squish it into the more horizontal.
So I thought that was a really smart idea.
So that�s going to be a pretty good value, although granted if you�re an Xbox 360 owner,
a lot of these games you�ve seen on live or probably will be seen on live a little
later.
So a lot of those same games, but you get them on the go on the DS.
The next one I played is the game I can�t pronounce, Kororimpa, Marble Mania on the
Nintendo Wii.
Okay, you remember those old things they had back when we were kids, like those little
marble mazes where you would turn the knobs left and right to move the marble around,
but you didn�t want them to fall in the holes, like you tried to get it all the way
to the end?
That�s this game on the Wii.
You tilt the Wii remote to tilt the grid around, and so you could say in that sense it�s
kind of like Marble Blast Ultra because there�s, you know, like things that get in the way.
Like one round that we played had these giant scissors that closed on the course and you
didn�t want your ball to be in there.
And by the way, your ball could either be a little steel ball, you could be like a soccer
ball, a basketball, or a little penguin ball, of course that�s the one I had to play with.
Not a monkey ball, that�s a different game, I�m sorry, but this game is kind of like
monkey ball I guess, but I actually felt this game controlled a little better than monkey
ball did.
I felt the controls were a little more polished on this game.
So I think if it�s released at a lower price point than your typical Wii game, I think
it�ll be a good buy.
It has multiplayer, and what�s interesting about multiplayer is you only need one Wii
remote because one person uses the Wii, one person uses the nunchuck to control because
you don�t really use buttons or anything, you just tilt the Wiimote around, which is
kind of interesting.
That was that game.
And then Brooktown High was the last thing I played on the PSP, and Brooktown High is
kind of a dating sim game.
It�s Konami basically trying to, what�s that game they had in Japan, Tokenshi Memorial
or what the, Tokimeki Memorial that they have over in Japan, this is them trying this in
the U.S., because you know, Konami sometimes takes a while to try things out that are successful
in Japan over in the U.S., like DDR, but this is them trying that.
And I gotta be honest, I don�t know if this is something I�d buy, but I played another
dating sim called Sprung, which is one of the most god-awful games I�ve ever played
in my life on the Nintendo DS, and this game was leaps and bounds better than that.
So as far as dating sims go, it wasn�t that bad, but I just don�t know if it�s the
kind of game I�m into.
I did like it�s very customizable, you can kind of tell it, you know, what sort of girls
you like and what your personality is like, and you can do a guy dating girls or a girl
dating guys.
Of course you haven�t seen the guys dating guys, but I hear it might be an Easter egg,
but I didn�t get anything official from the developers of the game, but regardless,
you can kind of get your character�s personality built by attending class and by the dialogues
you have.
Like I know they were saying things about if you claim to be a philosopher to impress
a girl, she might call you out on it and ask you a question about philosophy, and if you
don�t know the answer, you�re kind of screwed and you lose cool points with her.
So there are little things like that that are kind of interesting.
And I also thought it was interesting that they had like booth babes there promoting
Brooktown.
It was the only thing they kind of went out and did all these little cheers.
They really went all out for promoting that particular game at the show, which I thought
was interesting.
Yes, Dark Sakura.
I�m totally cosplaying Annette�s outfit.
What, from Castlevania?
Yeah.
Thank you for having nothing to do with what I just said.
No, I�m sorry.
I was still looking at � they had some of the promo art up on GameSpy.
Oh, that�s fine.
I played the Brooktown a little bit, and you know, the only thing that�s disappointing
is having played all the hentai, you know, dating sims out there.
I did like �
What?
You wanted to see 16-year-old Titty?
That�s gross.
No, no.
I hope it had in the game � did you notice in the trailer they had kind of all the symbols
for sex in there, like the rocket taking off and like the oil well going �
Oh, yeah.
I hope the god that�s in the game �
They did this weird-ass thing in the trailer where suddenly pictures of the game were replaced
with these real-life imageries of a flower blooming and a rocket taking off and all this
crazy stuff.
I hope that like, you know, if you go in for a hot coffee or something like that, you know,
that �
This is going to be really random, but did you see the new Psycho?
Like remember when Gus Van Sant remade Psycho, like in 1998 or something, he remade Psycho?
One of the things he did in the death scenes, he added these random-ass clips that had nothing
to do with it.
Like when one person is getting stabbed, like you see a train going through a tunnel and
like the clouds moving by in the sky and it�s like all this random shit.
That�s what that reminded me of, I mean, seriously.
Anyway, that was Brooktown.
Is Chat Room giving you a hard time for being stuck on a Castlevania Dark Sakura?
I don�t care.
I did want to mention that Korinpa and Wing Island are both going to retail for $40 instead
of $50.
Oh, cool.
You picked that up through your distribution thing because they didn�t say that at the
show.
Yeah, I picked it up, you know, I think I mentioned it maybe last week, whatever, but
yeah.
Other games at the show that they had, Death Junior Science Fair of Doom on the DS.
I didn�t see it there.
It was playable.
It�s just not a lot of people were playing it.
Sorry, Death Junior fans.
Go Pets on the Nintendo DS, which is interfaces with the PC.
It�s a DS and PC game, which I thought was interesting.
It looked to me like a cross between Animal Crossing and Nintendogs.
Jamie, you�d probably love this game.
I might love this game.
It looked interesting.
The graphics looked a little rough, but it might have just been early stages.
They didn�t have it playable, just the preview.
Let�s see, you talked about Hellboy already, right?
Yeah.
Lost in Blue 2.
I didn�t like the first one.
I didn�t care about the second one.
Sorry.
I played some of the mini-games, like the goat milking and the � no.
It looks literally exactly like the first one.
Lunar Nights, which we told you about at the F1 with Konami BBQ.
It looks pretty cool still, and Winning Eleven Pro Evo Soccer 2007 looked awesome on the
360.
That game looked � even on the PS2, it looked good.
It looks awesome, but to be honest, I couldn�t get too excited about it because it�s coming
out next week.
I mean, it�s like, why even waste the space with this game?
I mean, it�s coming out next week.
I mean, who cares?
It looked good, though.
I mean, it�s really nice looking.
I don�t really play a lot of sports games.
I�m thinking about picking this one up.
It looks that good.
So, I don�t know.
We�ll see.
Anyway, but we can�t end this story without saying something about the games that weren�t
there.
Of course, Metal Gear Solid 4.
We thought maybe we�d see another trailer, a playable demo, maybe, but nothing, nothing.
No Silent Hill 5, no Silent Hill Origins, no Coded Arms on the PlayStation 3, which
means it is probably true that the game was canceled, we�re thinking, or at least heavily
delayed.
Silent Hill Origins on the PSP vanished into thin air, just like most things in Silent
Hill.
So, very interesting what they didn�t show as much as what they did show.
What do you think about the lineup of Konami Gamers� Day overall, low-key, from being
at the show?
Make more console games.
Stop with all the portable games.
It was very interesting.
Remember when the first marketing lady, or whoever was up there, and I apologize I don�t
have my notes in front of you, she said something about that that�s where all the money is
right now.
Is that DS and PSP?
No, that�s not exactly true though.
Make some more 360 games.
Granted, they had two last year.
They had Rumble Roses XX, and then the follow-up Smash Hit Bomberman, two really awesome games
for the 360, and then this year they�ve got Hellboy, which Hellboy looks good, I�ll
give them that, and DDR Universe.
But put some more games on the 360, oh and I guess Winning Eleven Soccer, that�s great.
So three games this year.
I definitely don�t think we�ve seen everything for the year though.
This is what we� I mean, if you think about last year, we�ve only seen what�s coming
out through like summer, except for some of the DDR Wii won�t be out until the end of
the year, and some of those other ones, but most of the stuff is going to be out in summer.
Most of what they showed was going to be out in March, and I think we already talked about
most of that, but I mean, oh goody, so we�re going to see Karaoke Revolution, whatever
the next one is, on the 360 come fall.
SSJ100Matt says, �Kojima probably wants to take his time with Metal Gear Solid 4 since
it�s his last one.� Yeah, he says that every time, dude.
He says that every time.
Bullseye is his last one.
There�s money to be made.
He�ll come back.
Jamie, I know unfortunately you didn�t get to go because of school, but what do you think
from the perspective of getting to read all about this?
Are you excited about all this, or beyond just Castlevania?
Dracula X.
I really don�t care about anything but Dracula X, really.
Nothing in the world.
No Super Bowl, no Koro Impa.
That one sounds interesting, but my excitement over Dracula X is phenomenal, monumental,
bigger than a mole in terms of chemistry.
The creator of Castlevania was there.
I know it.
I hugged him.
He is still a fucking rock star.
I hugged him.
He came out and said, �I got a new hat.� Put on his new hat.
I have a picture of him, remember?
Yeah, I know.
We ran into him in E3.
I remember that.
I know.
I have all the celebrity run-ins.
I want to mention some things that slipped under that most people didn�t talk about.
There were some of the new lineups that they set for their plug-and-play stuff.
One of them, which was really big and I�m surprised I didn�t pick, Music Mania, which
I don�t know if it�s Beat Mania or pop music or something, but they have a three
and five key mode, and it�s basically a music rhythm game.
Even I missed this.
It was on the CD with the press stuff.
We�ll have to do a write-up on that and look at that.
What about the track and field?
I thought they have a plug-and-go track and field guild, like a power pad, old NES type
thing.
Very interesting.
I guess you could burn a lot of calories with that.
That�s what they�re encouraging.
Speaking of burning calories and also DDR, there was a study going on by the West Virginia
Public Employees Insurance Agency where they had, it was a 24-week at-home clinical study
where they had people play DDR five days a week for at least 30 minutes and record their
activity.
They had to help monitors.
They were tracking weight, blood pressure, arterial function, fitness level, BMI, and
general attitude toward exercise.
These studies came by, and see, all their studies, by the way, were above the 85th percent
offer body mass index.
Not all of them lost weight, but almost all of them were showing improved arterial function.
They were showing general levels of well-being improved.
The biggest thing on here, I thought, was confidence and self-esteem improved.
They were more willing to participate in activity because they were so active and had more faith
in their bodies and their capabilities.
In other words, it took this big study to prove that exercise, no matter in what form
it is, DDR or weightlifting or whatever it is, exercise is healthy?
We know exercise is healthy, but I think that taking something that makes it really fun
because in the average person's mind, I think, they're not going to see, oh, I'm exercising.
I can tell you from personal experience, I get weirded out with the idea of going to
the gym.
There's something about that whole public sweating thing and the whole body builders.
There's all those muscular people and everything.
There's kind of that big fear that kind of goes with the gym and intimidation that comes
with that.
You don't have that when you're playing DDR because it's like just playing a video game.
Even though there's a whole different side of it, like if you're playing at the arcade,
people call you gay or whatever, but fuck them.
It's about the fact that you're having fun with it.
I haven't kicked out.
I know.
That was the good old days at Roseville Golf Land.
We all used to go.
But, anyway, DDR is kind of different than that.
DDR is just kind of like having fun.
It's like, hey, we're playing a video game, making asses of ourselves.
That's funny.
It's healthy.
I miss Para Para.
Oh, yeah.
That was a good one, too.
I think the Para Para was more of a good aerobic workout than just DDR is because you
move in your arms with it.
It's a lot more.
Well, maybe that's what they hope to accomplish with this Wii thing.
Well, at any rate, there's a little bit more to this that I think is cool is the Office
of West Virginia Governor.
Actually, it looks like there's an association with the Department of Education and a few
other facilities, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield, are giving some financial support
to eventually lead this into DDR games, training PE teachers, and promoting DDR clubs in West
Virginia public schools.
And Konami gets all the profits, but that's okay because it keeps new DDR games coming
out at home, and as long as they stay innovative, hey, they're fine by me.
I just laugh for all those people who say, oh, DDR won't work in America.
I bet you feel so stupid now.
Well, you know what?
This news is so huge that they even covered it on the national news.
Did you hear that?
Really?
Yes.
I have a clip.
Hold on.
Researchers in West Virginia announced Friday the results of a study that suggests playing
the video game Dance Dance Revolution improves the health of overweight kids, though not
as much as its rival game, Hamburger on a String.
Okay.
Obviously, that was from Saturday Night Live.
It's still kind of funny, nonetheless, to see a little DDR joke make its way into Weekend
Update there.
I like Hamburger on a String.
And who doesn't love?
I miss Kevin Nealon doing the Weekend Update.
Yeah, but I love Amy Poehler.
I love her.
She's fine.
Not as good as Tina Fey, but I love her.
She was with Upright Citizens Brigade.
But anyway.
Hamburger on a String.
Ha!
I miss Chevy Chase, too.
I know.
So, you know, we all know that the PlayStation 3 resembles a George Foreman grill or a grill
of some sort.
Yeah.
In fact, people have gone as far as making it into an actual grill.
Well, now there's this one retailer in Akihabara that's selling some unofficial 6-axis soy
sauce to go with the PlayStation 3 grill.
That's kind of a joke.
They've basically rebranded some of the Bulldog brand soy sauce and, yeah, it's actually quite
funny.
They feature it in the smaller 20GB size or the larger 60GB size.
Is it $599 US dollars?
Is it made from giant enemy crabs?
No.
All these jokes will never get old.
It's actually, it's being sold at Sagatsu Isagi and it's being retailed for 3.99 yen
marked down from 4.99 yen and 5.99 yen for the larger one.
And it's kind of funny, though, because it has a picture of Ken Kataragi on the front
there.
Eating crabs?
And it also has a picture of...
The PlayStation 3 with the top lifted up with the grill on it.
To be honest, I think that would be pretty cool if there was a grill on it because then
you could eat and watch a Blu-ray movie at the same time.
If anyone doesn't know, Akihabara is the technical district, I guess, where you can buy all of
your techie goods and now barbecue sauce.
I really want to buy barbecue sauce when I go buy a stereo.
DJ Jenai says, 6-axis equals most innovative controller ever.
PS3 is the best.
Glad to know we have some Sony fans in chat because sometimes it feels like there are
no Sony fans left in the world, so I'm glad to see somebody is still standing behind them.
Anyhow, certainly these guys are fans of Sony.
They just express their fanboyism in a different way because it's, let's see, who did this?
On the first day that firmware 3.10 came out, it got cracked.
That's kind of funny.
This was cracked by team C plus D and basically what happened is that of course they released
the new firmware just a few days ago and it got cracked right in the same day by this
team who works hard to crack the games, I'm sorry, to crack the firmware so that you can
still continue to play your old school Nintendo games on your PS3.
And they've already come out with custom firmware for 3.1, so great, now you can actually install
the custom firmware, play all your updated games, and still be able to play your wonderful
NES ROMs.
DJ Jenai says, continuous is Sony fanboyism, saying, come on, Sony does what Nintendon't,
the Rob D counters with, everyone stands behind Sony, to laugh at them behind their back.
Rama says, I'll wait for the PS3 to be redesigned in retail for $149, give it six more months.
Ouch.
All right, any more PlayStation stories?
I suppose I have some information.
Okay.
Some.
Well, there's a little game that spawned a very interesting little music video called
Saints Row.
It's been confirmed that it will be going on to PS3, it's saying that sometime this
spring it will have PlayStation Network support, and so that means multiplayer online.
There was a mention, however, if they're going to have any additional content.
Speaking of Saints Row, and that game had some CD parts in it, well, if you happen to
be in some of the CD parts of Japan, you too can play the PlayStation 3 in one of Japan's
love hotels, and yes, that is one of those brothel hotels.
Casa Di Du in Shibuya, Tokyo, they have, with, I guess, your stay at these love hotels, you
can be able to play PlayStation 3 for free.
So I guess that's great, but at the same time, you know, I would be thinking, if you're staying
at a love hotel, wouldn't you be going there for sex and not to play the PlayStation 3?
Or is Sony trying to tell me the PlayStation 3 is better than sex?
Or is it one of those things where it's like, okay, I'm going here, and not only will I
get a hot chick to sleep with me, or borderline hot chick to sleep with me, but she'll play
games with me?
Well, love hotels aren't really just that.
They're also where people meet for rendezvous with their significant other.
And then all she would have to do is bake me a pie, and it's like the full thing.
I just wanted to get the death glare from Jamie.
I thought that was interesting, though.
I mean, I guess that's pretty cool, because after you've done it, then you can play video
games.
And it's just like you never left home.
Going back to a previous story in chat, reading some comments here, Mike W. says, it was decrypted
day one, talking about the firmware.
Then it was cracked.
Fault story, whatever.
I don't care if OLR gets it wrong.
Regardless, having the firmware get fucked with on day one, and having some form of security,
to obsess with it, whether it be decryption or whatever it is, has got to say something.
And it didn't take much longer after that, anyway.
Ramas Bolden says, PlayStation 3 equals Sony's final console.
The Rob D says, what would you listen to in a love hotel while playing video games?
I want you to watch me play Madden Skip from Mad TV.
I don't know if you've ever seen that, but it's kind of funny.
Ravens Dolphin says, Loki is going there with Nelly to a love hotel.
No, I wouldn't be going there.
Why would I travel all the way to Japan to go to a love hotel?
That's ridiculous.
All right.
Well, speaking of good lovin', there's this interesting thing here in Utah.
They have that games as porn bill that keeps trying to pass over and over again.
Well, unfortunately, the State House Committee of Utah voted to hold the legislation for
the third time the other day, and the reason is freedom of speech.
So of course, what they were trying to do is try to change it to say that Utah was going
to be basically had to be sold as like pornography does.
Let's see, Republican Kay McCliff had this to say, I am concerned when all the legal
experts including our own Attorney General as well as the sponsor tell us that the bill
is likely to fail in a constitutional challenge, one where we cannot control the amount we
spend because we spend our side and then we are potentially obliged to spend the legal
costs of the other side.
Kay is trying to draft a substitute bill to replace the original.
Leave it to a Republican.
Well, you know, I don't want to turn this into a political war, but it's just general
ignorance, I think, about the gaming community from everyone, and I think a lot of folks
could stand to be educated no matter who you are or how you vote.
I think a lot of-
But mostly Republicans.
I think a lot of people just don't get it.
I'm just giving y'all a hard time.
All right.
Well, but there is- I have some- I do have some news about someone who has his head up
his ass that makes me happy, speaking of, you know, Republicans.
Sorry, I won't go off on Republicans anymore.
There- Okay, sorry, there was some debate going on.
Can we start over, please?
Yes.
Okay, thank you.
Um, speaking of someone who has, uh, his head up his ass, um, he who shall not be named
except right now, Jack Thompson, um, has been, um, called on yet another complaint with the
Florida Bar.
Um, it's- Oh my God.
Anyway, there's a pending judicial review, um, for five counts of professional misconduct
against, uh, dumbass.
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be, you know, impersonal, right, um, against, uh, he who shall not be
named to be, um, actually he's supposed to be going to the, uh, State Supreme Court,
uh, for, uh, action.
That's pretty cool.
But the, uh, quote on here, um, says, uh, in the suit, uh, he who shall not be named
represented the families of two Fayette, Alabama police officers and a police dispatcher murdered
by an 18-year-old grand theft auto player in 2003.
At the time of his arrest for the killings, Devin Moore reportedly said, life is like
a video game, you have to die sometime.
More subsequently convicted of the murders now sits on Alabama's death row.
He who shall not be named was not involved in the criminal case against Moore.
Um, yeah, honestly, the other, the other, um, two complaints actually have to do with,
um, the attacks he made, um, on shock radio in South Florida and, um, you know, I'm just
so disgusted.
Really, I, I hope that, I hope that he is disbarred.
I hope this is the end of it.
And we never- That would be awesome if we never had to report
on him again.
That would be the best thing ever.
I'd hold a party.
Uh, Rama and Shay, I think, I think we would- You know what?
If this happens, we should throw a party.
We absolutely should throw a party.
We have a special party edition of Orange Lounge Radio, um, celebrating the vanquishment
of he who shall not be named.
We'll get guests and everything.
I bet you anything, because, you know, gamer Andy was a big part of that flower and he
doesn't live that far away.
I bet you we could get him here to join our party.
We'll get, we'll invite some, we'll get, we'll hold a big, massive frickin' party if this
happens.
We'll play World Combat Armageddon.
Yes.
Custom characters.
We'll play nothing but video games where we put Jack Tonsom in them, Tonsom in them.
What about the, uh, the Combine game?
Sure, we'll play that too.
Why not?
We'll play that too.
And, and, and, and, and- That'll piss him off.
And our Music of Choice's Two Life crew and Ice-T.
Bring it on!
I love this idea!
You know what?
I think we should have this party anyway!
No, but we're, okay, the party only happens if he gets disbarred.
Okay?
Is that, is that the criteria?
If he gets disbarred- If he gets disbarred-
In the state of Florida, OLR, he lost his licensed party.
He who shall not be named is vanquished.
However, if he is not disbarred, we send him a bag of poo in the mail.
No, no, no.
We're not children.
Come on.
Maybe we could call this bar is open party.
Going to the chatroom, Rama says, isn't he who shall not be named Voldemort?
So should we start- So do you, do you see the metaphor here?
Should we start calling him Jack- Should that be his new nickname, Jack Voldemort?
Jack Voldemort.
I love that idea.
He is just he who shall not be named.
From here on out, we are calling him Jack Voldemort.
I love that idea.
And by the way, the reason why I brought up Two Life Crew and Ice-T is that he was also
instrumental in the whole, you know, the cop killer scandal for Ice-T and for Two Life
Crew's as nasty as they want to be.
Wasn't that what it was called?
And we'll also listen to Howard Stern because- Yes, we should copy it and send it to Howard
Stern.
Oh, I love this idea.
Here's hoping.
Would this all happen like next week if it happens?
I missed the dates in there.
I hope it happens.
I don't think the dates were listed.
Everything in the legal thing is a slow process.
We'll see.
I'll have to check my legal sites.
All right.
Anyway, any time, you know, it's become tradition on this program.
Any time a story about Jack Voldemort comes up, you know what's going to happen next.
That's right.
It's our chance to rant about whatever we want.
It's the FUs of the week.
Get it out of your system, Darkstalker.
I have two.
The first one, FU to my uterus.
Next one is an FU to Roseville, Mitsubishi, you bastards.
Okay.
This is what happens.
My husband has a 2006 Lancer- Oh god, what Lancer does he have?
A rally art, sorry.
So it's like a model under the evolution.
It's a nice, nice car.
And he uses it to go to work, and he uses it, you know, sometimes for a couple of Bay
Area trips.
He doesn't drive it really crazily.
I drive more violently than he does, and my car is still in good shape.
Well, the transmission blew.
And he had, you know, a car with only 15,000 miles on it, he's only had it for a year.
There's no reason for a transmission to go out that quickly.
So he took it to Roseville, Mitsubishi.
And Bob Coffee, what I was saying is that it's the step under the Evo.
Listen to what I said.
Hi.
And the FU to my uterus is for PMS.
But anyway, back to the car.
When he took it in, this was, the car first of all has the 10 year warranty on it, bumper
to bumper warranty.
So he took the car in, and they said, well, you know, we have to strip it down to look
at the transmission, and if it's your fault, you pay $1100 to fix it.
Well, first of all, if you don't drive your car like shit, then there's no reason for
the transmission to go out.
So he said, to hell with that, and said, you're not going to charge me for taking it apart,
you're going to do the diagnostic on it.
Like fine, then the warranty won't cover it.
So he gets on the line with the, I guess the Mitsubishi corporate, they have a big stink
over it.
He said the customer service girl was friendly, but said that the caseworker was all like,
hey look, we're going to have them break down the car for free, it's our dime, which they
should have done in the first place, hi!
And then they said if they determine the transmission thing is his fault, then they'll put it back
together for free, and let him take it wherever he feels that he needs to to pay less for
it.
So, if I start talking about how much I love my new WRX STI, you'll find out what happened.
We had some, I'm reading comments from chat, we had someone named the uterus join chat,
that says don't let your uterus drive your car.
And Rama says fucking cunt, and I'm going to say don't talk to Jamie like that, that's
rude.
Can I talk to, no, no, no.
I know, he was saying someone else.
Let's see, and then also, but Rama did say this, which I thought was really funny.
He said, so if Jack equals Voldemort, that means that Jamie equals Hermione, Sky equals
Harry, and Loki equals Ron.
Dude, that means that I get Victor Crumb, and then the movie gets kind of hot.
What do I get, Cho Chang?
Hippity doo da, alright, anyway, was that it?
Are you and your uterus done?
Except she was really cool with this being, having that thick Scottish accent, I totally
did it, it's perfect.
Are you and your uterus finished?
I wish that men had cramps.
We do get cramps in a different story.
I wish that men had hormone related cramps.
I would love it.
Maybe someday you can have balls.
You'd all be big babies.
And so I can kick you in them.
Alright, uh, Loki, well I wish we could drive better, but we don't always get what we want,
do we now?
You know what?
Fuck you.
We did figure out why, we did figure out though why women drive bad, it's because estrogen
causes you to have, you know, I don't know, some sort of balance problems, or like, you
know, the world spins or something, I don't know, we're just going to use that as an excuse
for now.
I drive really well.
There's going to be a fight in the parking lot after the show.
I drive rough.
What?
I drive really well.
You drive like a bat out of hell, I mean, you do get us from point A to point B the
quickest way possible.
I'll give you that.
But, I don't cut people off, I don't talk on my phone while I drive, I'm like somebody
in this room.
You cast hexes on people when you drive.
And they get out of my way.
Loki, finish.
Um, I don't even remember what my FU of the week was to, uh, so yeah, I'm just going to
say bad to women drivers because there's been a lot of them, especially driving slow or
that, you know, they can't seem to, you know, navigate that minivan, you know, it's like
if you can't fucking drive a car, just stay at home.
Just fuck everybody who drives a minivan that doesn't need one of those.
And I swear to god I fucking hate people that drive, you know, SUVs, off-road vehicles,
mind you, that have to go over the fucking speed bumps like it's, like their car's made
of glass.
It's a fucking off-road car, it should be able to handle this damn little speed bump.
I know my car could go over that super fast.
Why can't yours?
Oh my god, I'm having to loop the music, we're going to six minutes here.
Actually, I have one, I have one more thing.
Oh goody.
I have one more.
Alright.
FU to people who think that just because you're married you need to start breeding.
Moooo.
Moooo.
First of all, children do not save a marriage.
It makes it worse.
Secondly, if you can't afford...
This is episode part FU, because that's all this segment's going to be.
Secondly, if you cannot afford the child, don't have one.
Thirdly, if I say I don't want children, fucking respect what I have to say.
Don't keep pushing it until I go puke in the bathroom at Cattleman's.
Thank you.
Can I do my FUs now?
No.
Do I get to do my FUs?
Okay, fine.
Alright.
So my FU of the week also goes to Jamie's uterus, and then I would like to say an FU.
Just kidding.
Heart.
I don't think she heard me.
My uterus, my choice.
I would also like to give an FU, and it's my choice to say FU.
Just kidding.
Heart.
Love you.
No, seriously though, I want to say FU to dentistry, because oh my god, my dental bills.
And it's not like my teeth are that awful.
I don't think I have, like I've not got some crazy thing going on, like a gap or anything.
It's just like, oh my god, I have so much money, and I can't afford her dental stuff,
so it sucks.
And then I got like a temporary crown way in the back where you can't even see it, and
it fell out two days after I got it.
I mean, come on.
I just feel like every time, I feel like going to the dentist is like going to used car salesmen
sometimes.
There's so much pressure.
No wonder people are afraid of the dentist.
I'm not afraid of the dentist.
I just fall asleep.
It's not just, it's not the drill work I'm afraid of.
I'm afraid of the way they treat people.
Anyway.
You should go to my dentist.
She's really cool.
I don't think my insurance will let me.
That's a whole other FU.
FU to your testicles, by the way.
Thank you.
Oh, sure, sure, anytime.
FU, Jamie.
Thank god, this is radio.
Your testicles sound like Grover.
Well they're blue.
Welcome to octaves of Jamie that you normally don't listen.
I don't know if it's picking up because she doesn't have the mic near her, but she's going
to listen about three octaves higher than we usually hear.
On this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, giggling schoolgirls, near, far, near, far.
Thank god this is radio.
Speaking of near and far, one game that's near dear to my heart, Grand Theft Auto, is
doing really well far away in Japan, where Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has taken number
one in their sales charts.
That is right.
Beating out such DS titles as those brain training things.
Fuck brain training.
It's all about killing hookers.
That's really what Japan needs, and god damn it, they just got their dose of killing hookers.
So way to go Japan.
You just need to get on the bandwagon now with Grand Theft Auto IV, then I could be
killing more hookers from Japan.
Kevin DDR says, what, GTA can't do well in Japan?
It's doing well now.
It's number one.
But I mean, should that be such a big deal?
I mean, it's number one here.
Was it not allowed to do well in there?
Usually US games don't do very well in Japan.
So I would think, you know, that, you know.
Rob says, sounds like the OLR crew just got ahold of the wacky weed.
No, we don't.
I don't know about the other two, but I don't really do that.
Drinking's fine, but we're not drunk either tonight, and only when drinking responsibly.
So.
Rob.
Winners don't use drugs.
Remember the FBI warning.
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
What?
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
What?
Never do that again.
It was funny and you know it.
Never do that.
Speaking of blue things, Sonic the Hedgehog is, had a funny little misprint on Amazon
and a little screen shot made its way to Kotaku this week and they labeled the story Sonic
the Vacuum Cleaner because they put a little picture of Sonic the Hedgehog under Dirt Devil
Upright Vacuum.
Obviously this is some type of database mistake, but it makes people LOL nonetheless because
it's kind of funny to see things wrong like that.
Like remember when they were selling the Wii for like $1,119 or whatever was the release
date?
Somebody screwed up the database?
Something similar happened here.
Maybe they just found out that Sonic the Hedgehog sucked?
Haha!
I see what you did there because I hadn't heard that joke a million times already on
Kotaku.
Speaking of games that suck, Unexpected.
This is like totally rad.
The Burger King had, they reported higher than anticipated quarterly earnings because
of the Xbox 360 promo games, at least that's what they figured.
The games actually pulled sales up to $38 million in the US alone.
And so, how can these games have gone double platinum?
I guess with the fact that they were $4 a piece.
Because there are 2 million achievement point whores in the world who just needed the extra
600 points that these games would give is actually what happened.
I guess.
They are also now $0.99 each.
I heard about that, that's crazy.
So if you haven't bought them yet.
There are two that I still need, I only have Sneak King.
Yeah, if you haven't bought it yet, might as well do it, because $0.99, that's not bad
for a game.
Even if it does suck.
You can collect collector's things before too long.
It will be as rare as Rondo of Blood, okay maybe not.
But nowhere near as awesome.
Let's hear what games are coming out very soon that could soon become collector's items.
Do you have any exclusives for us this week, Loki, on release dates?
No, because I took time off work and there wasn't really much to mention anyway.
We mentioned everything probably last week and anything exclusive would have been at
Konami's Gamer Day and all that fun stuff.
What was I going to say though?
But this week though, there's some good stuff coming out.
If you are a fan of Winning Eleven, you'll be happy to know that that is finally making
its way out now on PlayStation 2, on the 360, DS, and PSP.
So that's pretty awesome.
Also there's going to be, actually there's not a lot of PlayStation 2 games coming out
this week, I know that for a fact.
I do believe the Final Fantasy VI comes out on the Game Boy Advance this week, which is
pretty awesome.
So definitely check that out, because I know, what is it, Five did really well, everybody's
picking up Five.
There should be some more Wii's and DS Lite's coming to, I want to say to all the retailers
this week as well, because I know they've been out of stock for a long time.
They were actually sold out on Nintendo for the last two weeks.
Other than that stuff, wow, it was just a whole lot of crap coming out this week.
So I want to say that's probably what I'd really, oh, how could I forget this, Diddycom
Racing DS, that's coming out.
So if you know.
I've been seeing commercials for that.
If you want to get your fix on a Mario Kart type racing game, and this is kind of cool,
they've got a create your own track mode, you basically draw a track with the stylus,
so that's kind of neat, R. Tonleko on Playstation 2, another Atlus RPG, so definitely worth
checking out.
If you're into puzzle games, Capcom Puzzle World on the PSP, so that was pretty fun,
because it has Puzzle Fighter on it.
Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI on Playstation 2, if you're a fan of that.
And then MVP07 NCAA Baseball if you're into college baseball on Playstation 2.
I just want to say release date wise, because I don't know if you explicitly stated this
on an earlier show, but we did confirm that DDR Universe is February 27th.
So almost March, but not quite.
And I'd also like to mention Lunar Nights on the DS is coming out this week.
Oh, very cool.
Good, that was a neat title, I might have to pick that up.
Coming out in Japan, we like to cover Japanese release dates too, because sometimes it's
kind of interesting to see what they get a lot later, and also what they get over there
now we may be getting over here pretty soon, and I wonder if this might be one of them
on the Xbox 360, they're getting a badly needed role playing game this week, because
you know Xbox kind of gets a lot of slack for not having a lot of choice when it comes
to role playing games.
I mean sure you have Phantasy Star, which is kind of borderline, and then you have Enchanted
Arms, but they're getting a new game this week from Type, or I'm sorry from Idea Factory,
it's called Diario Rebirth Moon Legend, it's a new RPG coming out on the Xbox 360, coming
out in Japan on the 8th.
It's coming out in Japan this week on the 8th, Fusion Frenzy 2 on the Xbox 360, coming
out on the Playstation 3, Virtua Fighter 5 makes it's way this week on February 8th,
that should be pretty cool, it's also coming out with a little stick, a Virtua stick is
coming out just for that game.
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, guess what Jamie, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai, that's
the subtitle for Cooking Mama on the Wii, coming out this week by Taito over there in Japan,
oh she's over here to correct me, my horrible pronunciations, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai,
I'm getting better, Taikai, give me that, I'm getting better, you're getting better,
alright and coming out on the Playstation 2, Outrun 2 is coming out, Stella Deuce, and
one of my favorite title names for this week coming from Capcom, Full House Kiss 2 is coming
out on the Playstation 2, and the cover for Full House Kiss 2, it's four guys all surrounding
a chick holding a bouquet, so you know what that means, they're all going to go banger.
Coming out on other systems, the Nintendo DS has Jet Impulse and Luminous Arc and Morita
Shogi on the DS, all coming out this week, and lastly do we have anything on the PSP,
we do, New Rainbow Island, Herdy Gurdy Daibuken is coming out this week, that should be tons
of fun I'm sure, I know, but it's kind of like, Bubble Bobble in general, like I remember
like the retro Bubble Bobble stuff used to be cool, but ever since that whole no boss
on level 30 thing I just, Rainbow Island, I'm burned down on that shit, Rondo of Blood,
alright anyway.
Okay, well, for our friends in the UK, there are some games coming out, which is a good
thing because games coming out, you know, is fun, we have coming out February 6th, War
Rock on PC, on the 8th, Sam & Max Episode 3, the Mole, the Mob, and the Meatball on PC,
on the 9th though, just a crap ton of games, Avatar the Last Airbender on damn near everything,
Battle Stations Midway, Battle Zone, Blade Dancer, Lineage of Light, Bomberman, Charlotte's
Web on a few things, Deep Labyrinth, Maelstrom, Magical Starsign, Metal Slug Anthology, Naruto,
Ultimate Ninja, Okami, scrolling down because I'm running out of room, Saint Seiya the Hades,
Space Empires V, The Professor's Brain Trainer, Logic, and Memory, The Sims Life Stories,
Thrillville, Totally Spies 2, Undercover, and that's it so far.
Did you say they're getting Okami this week?
Yeah, PlayStation 2.
Now since way too many people overlooked that game over here, I'm leaving it up to you folks
over in the UK to show Okami a little love so we make sure we get a sequel out of that
game.
Sound fair?
I didn't know there was a Saint Seiya game.
I don't think you're going to get a sequel since Clover Studios is gone.
Oh fuck, that's right, huh?
Lots of Metal Slug, everybody.
Lots of Metal Slug.
Okami's sequel is now sitting with my Guardian Legends sequel somewhere.
Cry.
Sob.
Leap.
QQ.
Anyways, one movie that doesn't really need to be made is definitely going to be spawned
from a game with lots of sequels, DOA the movie.
Apparently it was going to be a theatrical movie but then apparently they realized, hey,
you know what?
The movie really sucks.
So let's just release it straight to DVD, which means that someone dumped it to the
internet.
Doesn't the movie have Ally Larter in it?
Who is...
Devin Alki in it.
Yeah.
Ally Larter is the one chick on Heroes that nobody likes her storyline and everybody who
TiVo's it fast-forward her scenes.
Is she the one who plays the split personality?
Yes.
I haven't even watched any and I know who that is.
I think she's in the movie, right?
The only thing I saw was a scene of her in that place.
I, you know, I...
Spoilers!
I told Rob.
I know.
It is available on Google Video and to be honest, if you really want to watch the whole
thing I guess it's better than spending the money to rent it or buy it.
But really, I just hear it's just yet another really bad movie.
It won't play.
Well, I think they had originally it linked on.
Don't they keep taking it down and stuff?
It keeps getting taken down, but it is.
It does come back up and if you read the Kotaku story which links to the structural story.
It's like that Natalie Portman video when she rapped on SNL.
They just kept taking it off of YouTube and it kept coming right back.
But here's what you can do if you really want to, you know, watch it and keep it or whatever.
You can always download the PSP or iPod versions and you can download those straight to your
PC.
If you don't want to stream it later on.
Brad from Pod Culture which is another indie podcast is in our chat room right now and
says, LOL we just reviewed that on our latest episode.
So if you want to hear Brad's review of Dead or Alive the movie, check out podculture.blogspot.com.
This whole movie could have been made a lot better and worth watching if it were rated
NC-17 and there was more nudity.
Because right now as it stands there is no nudity in it so that is the main problem to
why this, because it doesn't matter if the movie sucked, as long as it had nudity it
would have been great.
Whoever is playing this rondo of blood is really bad.
I mean how about the, you know, how about the...
You know one of those sites taped me playing one of the game.
I don't know who did it, but you know how like they do the...
Did you keep getting picked up by the dragon?
No.
Then this isn't you.
Oh good.
Because you know like sometimes they hook up their equipment like as you're playing
it and they're taken.
Like that happened...
I know some of the Rumble Roses XX clips out there were mean because like I was sucked
so bad I was getting owned and like so there's some Rumble Roses XX clip out there and I'm
playing the chick who's getting killed really bad.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I keep going back to...
I know, total tangent stuff.
Anyway.
We will beat the Dracula out of her during the break folks, so don't worry.
Oh, oh, oh.
There is a new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan this spring.
Sega and Toei Studios are teaming up for a feature-length adaptation.
It's Ryugo Goto-ku is the Yakuza name, part two is coming out.
It's coming out from Miike and he had practiced before making cinematic versions of the game,
so should be interesting.
He's also made Audition, Chakushin Ari, and one of Loki's favorites, Ichi the Killer.
Ichi the Killer is awesome.
He should be very excited about this new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan because if they
tear some guy's face off and throw it against a wall, I mean, I don't see how that could
be bad like in Ichi the Killer.
That was gross.
I still will not watch that.
You don't think they have a special edition of that out now, I think?
It's pretty violent.
If they have a super violent version of the movie, I would totally watch that.
I remember seeing it somewhere.
Well, at any rate, you know, there's I'm sure people who are going to be a little violent
over this bit of information.
A major UK retailer, HMV, their online store, is taking pre-orders for PlayStation 3s, but
you have to also purchase a 4GB PSP pack, so you'll be paying a total of £675.
They're sending an email out that will say you become one of the lucky few who can pick
up the PlayStation 3 at launch.
The quote says, at HMV.co.uk, we've been working with Sony to offer up to 5,000 customers an
incredible deal when you buy the new Sony 4GB PSP.
Sony takes advantage of this offer, will get priority over other HMV.co.uk customers for
the PlayStation 3.
The deal also includes two PSP games, Kills and Liberation and Gangs of London, for the
price of £674.99.
Are they expecting the same mass hysteria over there in the UK that they had over here
at first, which, you know, then after Christmas just kind of dropped off like a rock?
I mean, is that, because that's the kind of shit we saw them doing over here when it came
out.
It's crazy, and then realize the Wii was better.
Well, again, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, and, you know.
So the Wii is better.
Well, yeah, and the Wii had Zelda and all that.
There's one good PlayStation 3 game out right now.
One.
I really hope more comes out.
I mean, I, it's not that I want to see Sony fail, and it's not that I want to make fun
of Sony, and I love my PlayStation 2, but, God damn, Sony.
They're making it easy for us.
I know, it's like, God, argh!
We actually have not touched our PS3 in, I want to say, about two weeks now.
And the only reason we actually put anything in it was to watch Talladega Nights, and that
was Dan, and I left the room.
I'm sorry I grew up in Alabama.
Alpha Canagram says, I hadn't played Zelda in two to three weeks due to Virtual Console.
You know, I forgot to say at the top of the show I've been playing Virtual Console, that's
the other stuff I've been playing this week.
Mario Kart 64, awesome.
Still stuck on R-Type.
I've been playing Zelda, Link to the Past, as well.
R-Type.
Zelda, Link to the Past, Super Contra 3.
I can play that on my Nintendo.
R-Type.
My name's Jamie, and I have 50,000 consoles in my house.
They're all collecting dust, too.
We actually might sell some.
Really?
Yeah.
I'll have to find money.
I want a Virtual Boy, for no good reason.
Do you have a Virtual Boy?
You want to buy mine?
Five dollars.
Seriously?
Five dollars right now.
I don't know.
I'm going to get five dollars right fucking now.
I might have some change in my room.
Alright, anyhow.
I'll take it for six.
Ten?
Do I hear ten?
Fuck you, bitch.
I'll buy ten.
I put down ten.
Fifteen.
Do we hear fifteen?
Fuck that.
It's not worth fifteen dollars.
Yay!
Ten dollars!
Guess what?
I lied.
You're a bitch.
Alright, anyway.
You still love me.
Maybe.
While we all fight out how we're going to buy the console behind the scenes and play
OLR Bay, while we do that, we're going to take a quick break.
