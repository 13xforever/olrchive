7000	12000	We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.
14000	16000	Tonight, February 4th, 2007.
16000	20000	First-hand accounts of the newest Konami games from their Gamers' Day event.
20000	23000	Denver Live goes straight from theaters to video to the internet.
23000	26000	And did Windows Vista break your favorite PC games?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	41000	This is episode number 218 for this, February the 4th of 2007.
41000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
47000	48000	Yo.
48000	49000	How you doing, Jamie Summers?
50000	51000	I'm doing.
51000	52000	Yeah?
52000	53000	Been an interesting week.
53000	55000	Been an interesting week? Yeah, I could say the same.
55000	58000	It's been a very interesting week. We'll get into that in a minute.
58000	60000	Say hello as well though to Tech Master Loki.
60000	61000	Hello.
61000	62000	How you doing, Loki?
62000	63000	I'm doing good.
63000	64000	Did you have an interesting week as well?
65000	66000	Yes.
66000	67000	Alright.
67000	71000	Well, for those of you that are new to our program, we just want to say hello and welcome.
71000	74000	We were lucky enough to have a story of ours on the front page of DIG this week.
74000	77000	So we're thinking we might have got a couple new people thanks to that.
77000	80000	So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a big howdy hello to you.
80000	84000	Thank you for choosing to support independent podcasting, first off.
84000	91000	And just so you know, we're a show made up of three friends who have kind of become friends to each other just through doing this program.
91000	104000	We sit here and we talk about games every week and the way that you would sit down and talk at a dinner after you've gone to an arcade from a long night of playing DDR or Tekken or Derby Owners Crack, whatever it is that you play at the arcade.
104000	106000	Just kind of sitting around and chatting like old friends.
106000	115000	And sometimes we're lucky enough to break news here first because we have some inside contacts thanks to Loki being in the distribution world, among other things.
115000	117000	But sometimes we're not always going to break the news.
117000	119000	We're just going to talk about it and give you our viewpoints on it.
119000	124000	We're dedicated to giving every gamer a voice and we do that partially through our chat room as well.
124000	125000	A big hello to the chat room.
125000	131000	Joining us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com when we tape live here on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
131000	138000	Also we have our Skype line which we'll open up later in the program. It's also an 800 number you can give us a call at and share your thoughts.
138000	139000	We'll open that up later.
139000	141000	So that way all you guys have a voice.
141000	142000	All right.
142000	148000	And of course tonight they're talking a little bit in chat room about the Super Bowl which is going on right now.
148000	155000	But I guess between the three of us we kind of don't really keep tabs on what's going on in the Super Bowl.
155000	159000	But I will say the Puppy Bowl was awesome and I'm kind of sad I missed the kitty half time.
159000	162000	But the Puppy Bowl is kind of boring.
162000	164000	But the Puppy Bowl is cute because they have the bowl.
164000	165000	I like the bowl cam.
165000	168000	You know what? They need like a Madden for puppies.
168000	170000	Would you buy Puppy Bowl the game?
170000	175000	There was a Japanese TV show that I used to have a few copies of on tape.
175000	183000	It was called Uri Nari Land and they had dog soccer and baby soccer and cow soccer.
183000	187000	The closest I've come is Mega Man soccer I'm sorry to say.
187000	190000	I was thinking the Puppy Bowl would be something like that and it wasn't.
190000	193000	It was cute but it was just three hours of cuteness.
193000	194000	Puppies playing.
194000	197000	I was sitting in here working on some last minute things for the show
197000	209000	and I just hear out in the living room dark soccer and my roommate going.
209000	211000	That was your roommate that was not me.
211000	212000	No it was you.
212000	213000	Puppies.
213000	215000	It was both of you.
215000	216000	All right, well let's get into the game stuff.
216000	228360	I was on my ass in this chair, playing Tech in Dark Resurrection on PSP, and I'm gonna
228360	232040	get Dancing Blade, because I played the old one, and that was pretty cool.
232040	236240	I actually did not play any Cooking Mama this week.
236240	238520	Are you in a 12-step recovery program?
238520	244360	No, I'm in a, oh my god, my midterms are next week type of thing, so I've been studying
244360	245360	muscle groups.
245360	252120	Well, I guess if I went back and played some Trauma Center, I'd be okay for class or something.
252120	256600	I loaned out my copy of Trauma Center to a friend of mine who just got a Wii, so I'm
256600	261720	sorry to say I don't have my version for you to practice on, but that's a fun game.
261720	262720	So fun.
262720	265880	I like the Trauma Center.
265880	271400	I've actually gotten pretty good at some of it, but it's still frustrating.
271400	274520	Can't I just rub them until they're better?
274520	276400	So yeah.
276400	277400	That's really doing it though.
277400	278400	Alright.
278400	279400	Loki, how was your gaming week?
279400	285320	I played more of the Crackdown demo, like, another three or four times yesterday.
285320	286320	I love that game.
286320	288320	I just can't wait for the full thing to come out.
288320	291920	You know, it's one of those games that I was like, well, you know, because everyone was
291920	296240	saying, oh, it's kind of the demo, they didn't like the demo or anything like that originally
296240	297240	when I was first hearing about it.
297240	300160	I was kind of like, well, you know, I don't know if I'm gonna like this.
300160	305400	I actually like it better because you can actually explore a lot more of the city.
305400	311840	I did climb to the top of the tower in the middle of the city, which is fun, difficult,
311840	318440	and a little bit, you know, a little bit frustrating at times because, you know, if you fall off
318440	324120	that thing, you're pretty dead because you're falling like 50 stories, but it's cool because
324120	328640	once I climbed to the top and I had like 10 seconds left, I jumped to my death trying
328640	333100	to land on another cop because that was funny, but yeah, it was great.
333100	337760	And then I tried out another demo, actually NBA Street Home Court, a little bit different
337760	340400	of a type of game that I'd normally play, but it's pretty cool.
340400	341960	It actually looks really good.
341960	345920	All the screenshots are definitely pretty accurate of how the game is.
345920	351720	It's pretty cool, kind of reminds me of NBA Jam a little bit because, you know, the players
351720	357080	are doing stuff that you would normally not see anyone doing in basketball, but it's pretty
357080	358080	fun.
358080	360760	It's not a game I'd be picking up, but, you know, definitely a fun game.
360760	365360	I really wish NBA Jam would just come back, you know, because NFL Blitz is kind of lame.
365360	368760	You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but NBA Jam was definitely one I could get
368760	369760	into.
369760	370760	That game was a lot of fun.
370760	371760	It really was.
371760	375160	I just love the old NFL Blitz, but this Blitz League shit's retarded.
375160	377800	Some comments from chat room regarding your comments on Crackdown.
377800	381760	Jeremy Todd 1 says, the grenade launcher in the Crackdown demo is so freaking awesome,
381760	385720	you can literally just keep blowing everyone up with a single button push.
385720	389520	Flying flaming people equals automatic 10 out of 10 score.
389520	391600	Mr. Gohan wants to know, how did you get up there?
391600	393680	Jeremy How'd I get up there?
393680	394680	Climbing.
394680	399400	Seriously, it's just climbing, you know.
399400	402400	If you keep climbing up the side of the building, you'll eventually get to this part where it's
402400	407680	kind of flat, then on one of the ends of the three towers, they have, like, scaffolding.
407680	412200	If you jump on the scaffolding, you can kind of make your way up a little bit more, but
412200	418480	you really need to have, like, you know, at least a third level on your, you know, jumping
418480	424920	and stuff in order to be able to reach some of that, but you can get pretty high.
424920	428780	It's pretty fun, and it's even more amazing, too, when you get that high, you can still
428780	430760	see all the cars and people walking down below.
430760	435000	I mean, that's pretty amazing, you know, compared to, like, Saints Row, which, you know, you
435000	439960	wouldn't see any of that stuff, stuff would be glitching out and stuff, but I can't wait.
439960	442680	I can't wait for Saints Row 2 whenever the hell that comes out.
442680	443680	Crackdown!
443680	446800	That's going to hold me over for a long time.
446800	447800	Hold you over until what?
447800	448800	Oh, Grand Theft Auto?
448800	449800	Is that what you're waiting for?
449800	450800	Oh, yeah, Grand Theft Auto IV.
450800	451800	Anything else?
451800	457120	No, actually, oh, I played Luminous a little bit, I beat some, I got some more achievements
457120	464320	playing the time attack stuff, and I think that's all I played, yeah, that's it.
464320	469440	Alright, well, my gaming week wasn't too thrilling because I'm still in my World of War Crack
469440	473280	mode, so I'm still playing there with the guild, which, by the way, if you're interested
473280	477860	in joining our guild, we have a few OLR listeners in there that I've been playing with and chatting
477860	478860	with, it's fun.
478860	482400	I was just on there about an hour before we went live tonight, and if you want to join,
482400	486860	there's more information on our forums, it's orangeonsready.com, click on forums, right
486860	492260	now we play on the Ravencrest server on the Horde side, for the Horde, anyway, it's fun.
492260	495200	So a lot of people are making their Blood Elves over there because it's a newer server.
495200	501680	But anyway, outside of War Crack, not a whole lot of other games per se, but I did finally
501680	506640	check out Xbox 360's movie marketplace, because when it first launched, there was really nothing
506640	510440	I wanted to see, but then they added a bunch of Lionsgate movies just like a week and a
510440	514660	half ago, it's kind of like the artsy, well, sometimes, sometimes they have big budget
514660	518480	films like Saw, and I guess The Descent was kind of up there, but usually it's like kind
518480	519620	of artsy films.
519620	523200	So there was a film on there that one of my friends had seen that said I'd probably like
523200	527240	called Hard Candy, which I decided to download in HD, just because I wanted to see how was
527240	533080	the HD delivery and everything, and well, the movie itself was kind of weird, I mean,
533080	536600	I guess it was good for like the first 40 minutes, then it was just like WTF, it was
536600	541320	kind of gross, but anyway, outside the movie, I mean, I realized that Microsoft can't do
541320	545400	anything about that, the quality wasn't too bad, I thought it was kind of weird, because
545400	550760	when you first start watching the movie, it actually continues to download the last portion
550760	554920	of the movie, so you can't really rewind or fast forward or any of that stuff for the
554920	559360	first little bit of the movie until I was about an hour in, then it finally finished
559360	563120	downloading the rest of the movie, so I could rewind, fast forward, whatever, and basically,
563120	568120	once you download the movie to your hard drive, you have 14 days to start watching it, and
568120	572720	then, once you press the play button and start watching it, you have 24 hours to finish it,
572720	575620	which you know, if I'm going to sit down and watch a movie, that was certainly ample time
575620	579860	for me to finish it, but just so you know before you download any of that stuff, picture
579860	585580	quality because I downloaded an HD was pretty good I don't know if HD gives me
585580	589980	anything that much more than DVD does I mean yeah it's a little crisper yeah the
589980	595940	colors stick out a little more but is it worth essentially six dollars that I'm
595940	601660	paying to download the HD movie to watch one time I don't know I don't know I
601660	605840	might be better off just getting the HD DVD player and getting a Netflix I don't
605840	609640	know yet so it's hard to tell too because hard candy wasn't exactly a movie
609640	613500	with lots of bang up special effects and things it would be easier maybe if I
613500	616480	downloaded something like Poseidon that might have more of that I don't know but
616480	622820	it wasn't bad I would use the service again because at least it wasn't having
622820	626820	the slowdown problems that the store did when it first launched whatever I guess
626820	630180	maybe the curiosity factor is settled down a lot and things it's easier to get
630180	634420	in there and download movies now so I I would recommend if there's a movie on
634420	637780	there that interests you you want to see how it looks download one try it for
637780	641860	yourself why not I also downloaded for free because it was for free for a
641860	644820	couple days the first episode of the Sarah Silverman program which is
644820	649260	hilarious but the audio is off a little bit as it because we also take my
649260	652460	roommate taped it on the DVR and then I was like oh we can download it'll be
652460	656500	like perfect quality and while the video quality was great the sound was off I
656500	659220	don't know if that was me or what the hell was going I don't mean the sound
659220	663100	was muted but the sound was like you know when the sound is like just a hair
663100	666820	off of the lips it just bugs the hell out of you because it looks like you're
666820	672940	watching an old karate movie or something yeah yeah it's bad so maybe
672940	679020	it's just my copy of it I don't know whatever going to the chat room and
679020	683300	seeing what the folks are saying there in the chat room let's see black boy
683300	687900	says God Shelley winters in HD no not that not the old ass Poseidon adventure
687900	692660	I mean the new one who then what the new one have in it it had was that guy it's
692660	698460	in them got it can you remember his name who's the guy that's a snake in revenge
698460	703180	of New York or whatever oh that's carousel carousals in it that's what it
703180	707660	is Mike W says that Rob is a movie snob yeah maybe a little bit I don't know
707660	712860	Mike W says Rob like only plays Xbox Live Arcade yeah lately that's what I've
712860	716060	been playing there hasn't been a whole lot released on discs that I've wanted
716060	720940	to play but I enjoyed heavy weapon I love luminous I love the Xbox Live
720940	724860	Arcade it's like those little little throwaway games with a little like
724860	728940	because I have gamer a DD if you've lived in the show long enough you know
728940	733140	that I never stick with one game for a long time with the exception of the few
733140	736900	MMOs I've played and even then I quit and go back and quit and go back all the
736900	741220	time so Xbox Live Arcade games are perfect for me but I do want to check
741220	745300	out fusion frenzy which is kind of the same thing it's like 40 minigames in one
745300	749140	but it's an actual release game as opposed to Xbox Live Arcade and I'm
749140	751980	definitely looking forward to some of the Xbox Live Arcade news we have coming

843580	847420	right well let's get into some gaming news and we're gonna start it off as I
847420	850900	mentioned at the top of the show we were very lucky to have our coverage of dance
850900	855060	dance revolution hottest party hit dig this week so thank you guys very much
855060	859580	for giving us a dig on there and as we reported we were lucky enough to attend
859580	863060	Konami gamers day earlier this week and we'll tell you more about it throughout
863060	866900	the rest of the show here but of course you know since our show started many
866900	872300	years ago as a Bamani DDR music game type station we know a lot of our
872300	875080	longtime fans are very interested in this title and heck even some of you
875080	878300	guys who've come to listen to Orange Lounge Radio when we just tapped into
878300	882160	gaming in general you still can understand the dance dance revolution is
882160	886240	really up there it's the top if not one of the top maybe next to guitar here I
886240	890340	don't know music game franchises that people really follow so I think a lot of
890340	893460	people expected the DDR was going to come to the Wii it was just a matter of
893460	897220	time I don't know about you I wasn't expecting to hear it this early like I
897220	901100	kind of thought we would see it maybe like doesn't seem still early in the
901100	905620	Wii's life for us to be getting this game I don't know maybe maybe so I was
905620	908100	surprised at the timing of it I thought we wouldn't hear anything about it till
908100	911140	at least e3 if not 2008 but it looks like we are getting it this year at
911140	913860	least a cool point because it's not gonna be another PlayStation 2 version
913860	917860	this year I would think I don't know they didn't show one off so that would
917860	921580	that would imply that but I don't know there's a lot of stuff they didn't show
921580	925420	off economy gamers day so they didn't say anything about Metal Gear Solid 4
925420	928180	except kind of cock tease us with a release date and then not say anything
928180	933740	that was stupid they knew they knew me soon I was like that's such a they knew
933740	937740	we all wanted to know it they didn't say anything about Silent Hill origins I'm
937740	941100	wondering if that game got cancelled cuz coding on it's still it's still like
941100	945820	it's pushed back that's for sure Silent Hill now Silent Hill 5 was the game I
945820	949380	was thinking we were gonna see I cuz you know though we're gonna get a Silent
949380	952140	Hill 5 at some point the first four games are phenomenal there's the movie
952140	954860	and everything duh we have to get a Silent Hill 5 at some what nothing I
954860	958060	think economy gamers dating up about Silent Hill 5 doesn't that make you sad
958060	963180	dark soccer because I was looking forward to Silent Hill 5 not really why
963180	967620	because that sort might leave it to a much bigger announcement coming up later
967620	972380	ah so you think Silent Hill 5 is worthy of a press conference all on its own why
972380	976100	not okay fair enough maybe when they announce the sequel to the movie I don't
976100	980980	know well anyway a three new songs in DDR hottest party lips of an angel gonna
980980	984420	make you sweat and will buy a Naoki what's interesting with that is that the
984420	988220	teaser trailer teased that it was a brand new soundtrack from the ground up
988220	991060	and so it's kind of interesting because you have this lips of names are gonna
991060	994220	be sweat and then there was a weird cover of breakdown in there yes I
994220	1000740	remember both of myself and Mel B we right when the trailer annual that was a
1000740	1005700	really weird version of that song it's like what the fuck was that and they
1005700	1009820	talk about a soundtrack spanning four decades worth of music so I'm wondering
1009820	1013220	if this isn't kind of like the direction we're gonna see for the soundtrack an
1013220	1018260	all-new soundtrack of like remade songs of the last four decades along with a
1018260	1020620	few economy originals like this will bow Naoki
1020620	1026380	uh-huh we'll see it was interesting a little demo now of course it's on the
1026380	1029920	ween you gotta wonder how's the Wii remote gonna be used and yes you use the
1029920	1033220	Wii remote in the game they add a little basically I think this is more of a
1033220	1036740	concept build what we were looking at at this at the show because it basically
1036740	1041060	looked like DDR supernova but blue and then like every so often an arrow would
1041060	1044620	be replaced with this little icon that kind of looked like the Wiimote and then
1044620	1048760	uncheck the other cause symbol kinda it looked kind of weird and you that was
1048760	1052020	just your indication of shake you could do anything you want but they were very
1052020	1055360	I mean Jason Enos who's like the producer for this that was there demo in
1055360	1058540	the game and he said this is he emphasized over and over again this is a
1058540	1062380	very early concept thing we just want people to know it's coming we're still
1062380	1068220	really experimenting with what the we thing is going to do by the way I want
1068220	1070740	to mention something I didn't post anywhere on the site since Jason Enos
1070740	1074100	was there I took an opportunity to ask him a couple questions and I asked him I
1074100	1078020	said so how about DDR in the arcade and anything you want to say about DDR in
1078020	1080740	the arcade and he of course didn't really have anything to say I said what
1080740	1083980	about that rumor there's an expansion coming to supernova with you know the
1083980	1088100	20 30 20 30 or more songs he said he didn't know anything about it which
1088100	1091700	could be the polite way of saying no comment I don't know but rest assured
1091700	1096580	those rumors that you've seen floating around the other DDR sites Jason says
1096580	1100140	you don't know about it so that's what I'm going with I'll trust him that's
1100140	1105100	interesting that is I was reading there's some rumored release dates and I
1105100	1110420	haven't heard anything about this yet but that was it that stupid Codemasters
1110420	1116300	dance factory game was gonna be coming to the Wii in March before DDR oh
1116300	1121340	interesting but I mean I can tell you right now the games could be ass just
1121340	1125180	because the last one is ass I'm looking at some comments from chat room Jeremy
1125180	1128340	Todd once says Silent Hill origins is now the next Duke Nukem forever god I
1128340	1133140	hope not jaded says Silent Hill there won't be a five I doubt that those those
1133140	1136620	are big where there's got four sold pretty well didn't it I'll see why there
1136620	1141820	wouldn't be a five all right Rama says DDR supernova 2 in the groove dream on
1141820	1147060	dream I'm sorry I've been following the Bahmani scene for a long time in the
1147060	1151500	groove songs are not is not coming to DDR and I I don't I don't have any
1151500	1154860	insider knowledge to back that up granted but just having followed Konami
1154860	1158740	in the biases as long as I have it's not happening stop getting your hopes up
1158740	1161860	about it because you're gonna be disappointed I'm sorry not happening
1161860	1166700	once that ruling passed in the groove was officially dead so anyway that away
1166700	1171100	from that back to DDR on the week that's what we really want to talk about yeah
1171100	1173500	what I thought was interesting is the selection screen you could use the Wii
1173500	1176860	remote to like point-and-click at songs you wanted to play and it had a cute
1176860	1180860	little DDR arrow icon I don't know just it's a long memory right now yeah I'm
1180860	1184060	sure I'm sure what did you think look because you actually got to play it what
1184060	1190100	did you think actually playing the game did it feel right was it weird it was
1190100	1195940	like DDR hands and feet mode but it's just it's it let me put it this way the
1195940	1200020	hands and feet mode was awkward this is just as equally as awkward at least as
1200020	1204780	it is right now and it's not it's just it doesn't it's almost like it doesn't
1204780	1208980	need to be there just because you know you supported the iToy you don't need to
1208980	1213300	have a hands and feet mode in that although the thing is though if they do
1213300	1217180	something like this they could do some really interesting stuff with it like
1217180	1220220	instead of you know have a whole section of the song that's all done with your
1220220	1223300	hands I mean that might be kind of cool that's what Jason was kind of implying
1223300	1226620	that they might want to do things where you do different motions like he
1226620	1230340	referenced Saturday Night Fever like the disco pose like there might be a symbol
1230340	1233820	that you have to do that kind of pose and that they could do like what was in
1233820	1237240	a samba de amigo that and that's what a lot of people are coming away from the
1237240	1240540	saying is that it sounds like it could be DDR mixed with samba de amigo and I
1240540	1244220	don't see any reason why that's not a possibility so I mean it right now it's
1244220	1248780	just it's still way too early it is and you know that there's DDR with possible
1248780	1253140	stuff I was able when I played it I thought it was it did feel like it
1253140	1256220	played a lot like hands and feet mode because none of this extra stuff was in
1256220	1259420	there but I felt it was a lot cleaner because the problem I have with the
1259420	1264660	itoy is the device just sucks yeah if you're not in the exact right lighting
1264660	1269300	it doesn't win that's not Konami's fault it's just the itoy sucks I'm sorry I've
1269300	1275100	not played one good thing with the itoy not one and you have to have the exact
1275100	1278660	right lighting to make it work and it never is right on DDR I don't know if
1278660	1281540	you have a house where you can get it to work every time but the nice thing about
1281540	1286100	playing this on the Wii was that it worked every time like it you you know
1286100	1290500	it you don't have to have the perfect white background in your house to get
1290500	1294140	the wiimote shaking to pick up so that's what I liked about it is that and it
1294140	1297380	didn't matter where my hands or feet where I could kind of do it wherever so
1297380	1301700	that was kind of fun so I I had fun with it and it certainly posed to I mean I
1301700	1305860	was struggling on medium level difficulty songs you know so it
1305860	1308780	certainly adds a whole new challenge to it which I'm sure the purists will not be
1308780	1313220	happy about but DDR needs to evolve I did find it interesting though that all
1313220	1318260	the dance pads were just the GameCube dance pads I think you know in speculating
1318260	1320700	that DDR was going to come out on the Wii I wondered how they were gonna do
1320700	1324340	the wireless pad without lag and it never occurred to me duh just use the
1324340	1327660	GameCube pads because there's GameCube controllers on the thing and looks like
1327660	1330100	that's what they're doing because that's what in the trailer you could see
1330100	1333900	clearly that even the non Mario pads they use in the trailer were just plug
1333900	1338060	in yeah the GameCube slots anyway just really quite wanted to quickly say about
1338060	1343020	DDR Wii before we move on also it's going to feature an updated battle mode
1343020	1347100	a support mode where I know they talked about they really want this to be the
1347100	1351220	family DDR they want this to be the game that mom dad kid brother sister all play
1351220	1354660	together and they they're gonna have a mode in this where you actually talk to
1354660	1358140	each other and you have to do the same pose at a certain part in the song they
1358140	1361220	know they want that in one type of mode so you have to communicate with each
1361220	1364180	other say okay we're gonna disco we're gonna disco whoa we're gonna sprinkler
1364180	1367900	Roger Rabbit I don't know whatever so that's gonna be interesting I think if
1367900	1372580	nothing else now also free play mode and work workout mode no sign of edit mode
1372580	1375660	but I don't see how you couldn't have a DDR right now without edit mode so I
1375660	1377800	don't see why that wouldn't be coming for those that want to edit the Wii
1377800	1381180	things into it yeah it's way early it's probably just a technical issue for
1381180	1384860	right now so if you want to see more on it we even have some pictures we took
1384860	1388820	some pictures of the trailer which hasn't come out anywhere else yet and
1388820	1391540	there's a picture behind the scenes there you can see Jason a demoing it
1391540	1395700	for some girl from some unknown press site who's giggling over it you see all
1395700	1400820	that on our site and we have the only picture of the interface as it is now
1400820	1403380	but that's going to change the interface is going to change that was obviously a
1403380	1406820	temporary interface but that's all at orange lounge radio.com if you want to
1406820	1410700	see more information on that so Loki what what else did you see economies
1410700	1413620	gamers say that you enjoyed there's actually quite a few games there and I
1413620	1417260	got to try a little bit of everything one of the first games I tried was time
1417260	1421380	ace which in the preview kind of reminded me of time pilot because you're
1421380	1424540	playing in kind of different time periods and you're flying planes and
1424540	1429700	stuff the game itself actually reminded me the graphics remind me of prop cycle
1429700	1433020	I don't know if you remember that old arcade game I freaking love prop cycle
1433020	1436540	that's like one of the most underrated arcade games ever it reminded me very
1436540	1441220	much of that it weren't you big on prop cycle Jamie I remember you looked at an
1441220	1445020	M car K when it came out yeah the prop cycle is a bomb and you fan yourself I
1445020	1449780	played it for free I love so much anyway sorry anyways but on the game kind of
1449780	1453380	reminds me of at least the level that they had you try out where you kind of
1453380	1458380	playing this biplane thing to be honest the game itself could very much be wing
1458380	1462020	island on the DS I mean you're just you know doing different missions you're
1462020	1466300	fighting you know planes in the air I mean it seemed pretty solid you know
1466300	1469540	graphics are a bit rough but I guess that's you know that's just a DS for you
1469540	1472220	what is it you were saying something about you thought this was a sequel to
1472220	1475620	time pilot I thought it was a sequel to time pilot that's I mean it makes it
1475620	1480140	time ace time pilot meaning both of them are biplane games where you're fighting
1480140	1484500	in different you know time periods it seems logical to me and interesting I
1484500	1488940	just know I for some stupid reason to not make that connection I don't know I
1488940	1492900	just thought that's you know what they were doing I could be wrong they could
1492900	1496900	just be kind of a something that's almost identical and has almost the same
1496900	1502520	name whatever another game I did play though was coded arms contagion for the
1502520	1509580	PSP and I can tell you having played the first one it still sucks and you know
1509580	1512940	it's very unfortunate because it looks like they really tried to make the game
1512940	1517980	load better it's just unfortunately for the PSP first-person shooters just suck
1517980	1522060	on the PSP and that's just because they don't have two analog sticks it's really
1522060	1526860	hard it's real sluggish to move around if maybe if they increase how fast you
1526860	1530740	turn and stuff in it might be a little bit better but it's just those four face
1530740	1536260	buttons using as like a second analog stick it's just not good at all that's
1536260	1539940	really unfortunately a problem with the system but you know the game itself
1539940	1544740	looks pretty good I mean it's okay I just I didn't have very much fun with it
1544740	1548620	but you know what can you what can you say yes if you're used to playing you
1548620	1551820	know first-person shooters on the PSP then great maybe one to check out
1551820	1556060	definitely a good thing that they didn't do the random levels like they did the
1556060	1563260	first one but it kind of reminds me like a Metroid Prime type game Dewey's
1563260	1568020	adventure I know we saw the video of that looked okay kind of reminded me of
1568020	1572140	Kirby a little bit actually reminded me of one of their own titles it reminded
1572140	1578340	me of the Koron Koron I can't say that Korin pa Korin pa I can't say that word
1578340	1582340	it reminded me of Korin pa kind of like in the way that you tilted the
1582340	1585860	environment around but yet with this additional angle of changing the
1585860	1589580	temperatures to change Dewey from a liquid to a solid and from a solid to a
1589580	1593420	gas and what were they saying something about like when he's in solid form he
1593420	1596580	damages enemies more but he's more difficult to control when he's in liquid
1596580	1599900	form he can't really damage enemies but he's easier to control and then when
1599900	1603780	he's in gas form he just kind of goes wherever he just but he can't really do
1603780	1606960	anything else it's very interesting the way you change temperature and it's
1606960	1610020	supposed to change the environments completely so it's a nice thing you can
1610020	1614740	actually shake the controller certain ways to you know cause earthquakes or to
1614740	1618380	like cause wind and stuff like that so that's kind of unique for a platform
1618380	1619380	game.
1619380	1622980	When they were about to announce Dewey�s Adventure and they were showing the trailer
1622980	1625740	and everything and they didn�t tell us what the name of it was yet, didn�t you think
1625740	1628020	we were about to see Elibits 2?
1628020	1629180	I totally thought that�s what was coming.
1629180	1633500	The cut scene for the artwork is exactly the same.
1633500	1637280	It�s the same style, they got the same people that did all the arts in Elibits to do this
1637280	1638280	game.
1638280	1644340	It even had glowing creatures that were small.
1644340	1647300	All they�re doing is remaking Elibits all over again.
1647300	1650420	But then when we actually heard about the concept, it was nothing like Elibits at all.
1650420	1651420	No, it�s not.
1651420	1655900	But I kind of thought it would be interesting to keep it in the same universe but just have
1655900	1660980	it be a different thing, because it�s almost like the same art style.
1660980	1666660	I could see it later on, they�re having a box set from this guy, it�s like a bunch
1666660	1670140	of different stories that are kind of in the same universe because they all seem to be
1670140	1674100	told the same way with really bad dialogue over the entire cut scene.
1674100	1675100	It was cute.
1675100	1676100	It was cute.
1676100	1677100	But yeah, it was okay.
1677100	1681820	There are tsunami props for original stuff with that in Elibits and everything.
1681820	1686180	How easy would it have been to have just ported Castlevania to the Wii where you use the Wii
1686180	1687180	as the whip?
1687180	1688180	Whoopee-doo!
1688180	1691060	But they�re coming up instead with original things for the Wii, which I think is kind
1691060	1692060	of cute.
1692060	1693220	But I want a Castlevania game where you use the Wii as the whip.
1693220	1694800	I know we all want that.
1694800	1695800	We don�t need it right now.
1695800	1698420	We have this other Castlevania thing to look forward to we�re going to talk about in
1698420	1699420	a minute.
1699420	1700420	We don�t need another 3D Castlevania though.
1700420	1701420	That�s true.
1701420	1702420	Castlevania 64 still burns a little bit.
1702420	1706480	Hey now, we have 3D Castlevanias that aren�t that bad.
1706480	1707480	But they�re not that good either.
1707480	1710540	Castlevania 64 made my soul cry.
1710540	1713260	Compared to Symphony of the Night, everything since looks like poop.
1713260	1714260	I�m sorry.
1714260	1715260	No, no, no.
1715260	1717740	Compared to freaking Rondo of Blood, everything is poop.
1717740	1718740	We�ll get there in a minute, sweetie.
1718740	1719740	We�ll get there in a minute.
1719740	1720740	I know.
1720740	1725260	Well, Symphony of the Night was great, but it wasn�t a true Castlevania in my opinion.
1725260	1726260	It was like Metroid featuring�
1726260	1727260	Then fart in words.
1727260	1728260	Then fart in words.
1728260	1729260	Then fart in words.
1729260	1732260	It was Metroid featuring the Castlevania characters.
1732260	1734660	I�m not saying it was a bad game.
1734660	1739820	It�s one of my favorites ever, but it was Metroid featuring Castlevania characters.
1739820	1743140	But it was the best thing I�ve ever played, one of the best games I�ve ever played in
1743140	1744140	my life.
1744140	1746900	And granted, I think the best video game ever made.
1746900	1749860	I don�t know how many times I�ve said this on the show, but I think the greatest
1749860	1752620	video game of all time is Super Metroid.
1752620	1753620	Dude, Metroidvania.
1753620	1755260	And so of course I love Symphony of the Night.
1755260	1757060	Junami said it best, though.
1757060	1758060	Metroidvania.
1758060	1759060	Whatever.
1759060	1760060	Anyway.
1760060	1763740	Anyway, so another game that wasn�t like Metroid, Hellboy, was actually pretty cool.
1763740	1767500	It�s kind of a beat-em-up type of game, of course, based on the Hellboy comic.
1767500	1772660	It looks really good from what I�ve seen so far, and they had one level that they were
1772660	1774940	demoing there at the moment.
1774940	1776700	And it was kind of cool.
1776700	1780580	Definitely a lot of detail in there, and it�s kind of cool you can go around ripping heads
1780580	1785420	off of little demons and throw them at them and stuff like that, and the entire environment
1785420	1786820	was pretty destructible.
1786820	1792240	So I think it definitely looks like a better game, definitely a lot better than their last
1792240	1796700	brawler that came out, so it should be good.
1796700	1798340	The other one, Wing Island.
1798340	1806380	Wing Island on the Wii actually could very well be a sister game to Pilotwings.
1806380	1811660	It pretty much is Pilotwings from what I�ve seen, and also once again kind of the same
1811660	1816200	art style as Prop Cycle.
1816200	1818540	Very simple graphics, but it�s fun.
1818540	1822820	You play a squadron of biplanes and you get a bunch of different missions from finding
1822820	1829460	lost cows to delivering goods to putting out fires and stuff like that.
1829460	1832420	So definitely kind of the same feel as a Pilotwings game.
1832420	1836340	I�m looking at chat trying to answer some questions.
1836340	1842060	Travis Donovan for Prez in �08 asks, �How did Rob get an Elibit for his 360 Gamer picture?�
1842060	1846060	You�re seeing a lot of people on Xbox do this now, and it�s all thanks to the Xbox
1846060	1850260	Webcam, and the way I got an Elibit is that I got one of the little stuffed Elibits from
1850260	1854240	GameStop even though I didn�t pre-order the game, but I got that and I just put it
1854240	1857300	up against a white background and took a picture with the Xbox Cam, because you can do custom
1857300	1859780	gamer pics with the Xbox Live Webcam.
1859780	1862620	I saw somebody else on my friend�s list, I want to say Rob Way or one of our listeners
1862620	1866260	has like a glowing Wii logo as his gamer picture.
1866260	1868620	A lot of people are doing cute things like that.
1868620	1874100	For a while I had a Mario Kart as my background because you can import themes from pictures
1874100	1878380	on your computer, so you can do fun little customizable things with your 360 that kind
1878380	1879380	of make you go, �What?�
1879380	1880380	I haven�t bothered.
1880380	1883180	I just have a perfect dark.
1883180	1885180	That�s fine.
1885180	1889620	And the one that the public sees, because you only see the camera pictures if you�re
1889620	1891740	on the friend�s list, but what do I have?
1891740	1894060	I think I just have one of the Pac-Man ghosts or something.
1894060	1895300	I change it almost all the time.
1895300	1896780	I change it like every week.
1896780	1898620	It�s like my MySpace.
1898620	1900900	You got to change it all the time to keep it current.
1900900	1901900	Rob, look.
1901900	1902900	What?
1902900	1905380	Oh, you have Pac-Man background on your phone.
1905380	1906380	That�s cute.
1906380	1907380	It was a downloadable thing.
1907380	1908660	Did you pay money for that?
1908660	1909660	Yeah.
1909660	1910660	I was bored.
1910660	1911660	Loser.
1911660	1912660	When I�m bored, I buy stuff.
1912660	1913660	All right.
1913660	1914660	Like most women.
1914660	1915660	Hey!
1915660	1916660	Hey, hey, hey.
1916660	1917660	You�re mad because it�s true.
1917660	1918660	Can you stop that right now?
1918660	1919660	Hey, hey, hey.
1919660	1920660	Yikes.
1920660	1927020	I just got a bottle thrown at me.
1927020	1928020	You bitch.
1928020	1929020	All right.
1929020	1930020	Rob.
1930020	1931020	Rob Hart.
1931020	1932020	Bleeding.
1932020	1933020	It bleeds for you.
1933020	1935380	Bleeding black deafness from your heart.
1935380	1936380	All right.
1936380	1937500	Anyway, let�s talk about Castlevania.
1937500	1939580	This is something Jamie and I can agree on.
1939580	1946300	They showed Castlevania the Dracula X Chronicles for the PSP.
1946300	1949580	It�s going to be our first Castlevania game that we have on the PSP.
1949580	1953700	What�s interesting is that elements of it are new, but it�s still kind of an old game.
1953700	1957260	Basically, what the Dracula X Chronicles are is that you�re going to have this old game,
1957260	1962340	Rondo of Blood, which they said has never been in the U.S. before.
1962340	1964140	Never.
1964140	1970020	It hasn�t, but I can�t stop thinking about Castlevania V. Even though that game was ass,
1970020	1975060	I mean, really, that game was like the worst Castlevania game they ever made next to 64.
1975060	1976540	Well, yeah, but in Japan�
1976540	1980220	Actually, I would rather play Castlevania 64 than Castlevania V.
1980220	1983140	In Japan, by the way, it was released as Dracula XX.
1983140	1984140	Right.
1984140	1985140	Well, so they kind of�
1985140	1986140	Or death�
1986140	1989660	Or death, but I mean, after you got past the first stage, a lot of it was different, so
1989660	1991700	it wasn�t really the same game, but in a way, it was.
1991700	1992700	But anyway�
1992700	1993700	I�m watching the trailer.
1993700	1995780	That�s as much as we got of Rondo of Blood previously.
1995780	2000540	Well, now we are going to get not only the classic Rondo of Blood game on the PSP, but
2000540	2002820	they�re redoing it with Upped Graphics, and that�s what they showed�
2002820	2003820	Oh, this is sexy.
2003820	2004820	I know.
2004820	2005820	That�s what they showed at the show.
2005820	2007220	I�m watching IGNs.
2007220	2010940	The whole first stage was playable, so we got to play that, and it was awesome.
2010940	2014060	Now, the thing you have to remember about Rondo of Blood is since�
2014060	2015060	Did we redo the intro?
2015060	2016060	Yes.
2016060	2017060	It�s all CG.
2017060	2018060	But is it still in Gothic German?
2018060	2019060	Yes.
2019060	2020060	I think so.
2020060	2021060	That thought.
2021060	2022060	I think.
2022060	2023060	It was hard to hear sound in there, but I think.
2023060	2027060	Well, you remember, though, the show where I brought in my turbo duo and hooked it up
2027060	2028060	and played it on air.
2028060	2029060	That was in like 2003 or 2004.
2029060	2030060	It was a long time ago.
2030060	2031060	Yeah, that was a few years ago.
2031060	2032060	Yeah, I remember that.
2032060	2034060	I�ll bring it back one day.
2034060	2036460	But yeah, it was a sexy game.
2036460	2037460	It looks great.
2037460	2041420	I love, love, love the 2D with the 3D look.
2041420	2044860	I mean, the best thing I could compare it to is like if you�ve played Super Smash
2044860	2049540	Brothers Melee and you�ve played that mode where you like actually are in the Mario game,
2049540	2053940	but it�s like all 3D-ified even though it�s 2D, that�s what they did to Rondo of Blood
2053940	2054940	in this enhanced mode.
2054940	2055940	It�s great.
2055940	2060360	Okay, instant impressed points for me.
2060360	2062780	The game mechanics are the same as 2D.
2062780	2064540	Yeah, you can do the back flip.
2064540	2065540	Not just that.
2065540	2066940	I was checking the timing of the moves.
2066940	2069060	They�re exactly the same as the PC engine.
2069060	2072660	It did play a little weird from the Castlevania games I�m used to, but I understand that�s
2072660	2076300	because the controls handled a little different back then.
2076300	2079260	Also something you have to remember, since this was before Castlevania the Night, you
2079260	2081300	cannot just go anywhere you want.
2081300	2086480	It�s a little more like Castlevania 3 kind of with the branching.
2086480	2089420	You can kind of branch off in different directions, but that�s about it.
2089420	2093900	Well, the whole point of the different directions, and I think that for people who aren�t familiar
2093900	2100220	with Rondo of Blood, is that your ending is affected by how you play the game.
2100220	2102740	You�ve got secret hidden parts.
2102740	2109860	For example, a lot of people were wondering who Maria was, who didn�t know any better.
2109860	2114980	She was actually playable in Rondo of Blood if you rescued her, and all of her attacks
2114980	2121180	were kind of stupid and cutesy little girly attacks, but they were also based after the
2121180	2123700	four gods of Chinese mythology, which I thought was pretty funny.
2123700	2126940	Oh, they redid the graphics for the Uber attacks in this game, too.
2126940	2127940	Oh, yeah.
2127940	2128940	It�s nice.
2128940	2133780	When you play the Saturn version, though, she has the same attacks, only just on a grander
2133780	2134780	scale.
2134780	2137180	Symphony of the Night will also be included.
2137180	2140300	That�s why this is the Dracula X Chronicles, so you get two versions of Rondo of Blood
2140300	2143420	and Symphony of the Night for one game, and that�s pretty awesome.
2143420	2147660	Now, they�re not redoing the graphics for Symphony of the Night, but they tease the
2147660	2149620	idea that they might add new areas.
2149620	2154380	They�re thinking about going back and retooling that game, and I�m theorizing, why not give
2154380	2155380	us the Saturn version?
2155380	2159140	I mean, I realize you can�t really port the Saturn, but give us what the Saturn version
2159140	2160860	had with Maria and that whole scenario.
2160860	2161980	That would be awesome.
2161980	2164180	Or the extra familiars.
2164180	2172620	For America, it would be an addition, because of course we didn�t get the Saturn version,
2172620	2174820	and as for the extra familiars, they were useless.
2174820	2177260	They took them out for a reason, and I�m pretty glad that they did, because they were
2177260	2178260	stupid.
2178260	2181620	All it was was another one of the same thing that you already had.
2181620	2183940	Dude, the item crash is hot.
2183940	2188380	Ravens Dolphin says, �I thought Dark Sakura would be more excited about this.� Okay,
2188380	2192540	when she first found out, I think I had to hold the phone about 10 inches away from my
2192540	2197540	ear, because I was going deaf from the squeaking.
2197540	2204500	Seriously, when I was watching the trailer, I sat there and actually thought to myself,
2204500	2208980	�Jamie�s going to piss herself.� I mean, literally, because if you�ve listened to
2208980	2213540	this show ever since Episode One, Jamie never shuts up about Rondo of Blood, and what a
2213540	2214540	great game it is.
2214540	2215540	It�s my copy while we were doing the show, remember?
2215540	2216540	I do.
2216540	2223260	Because I had gone to Anime Expo, and to put the long story short, my friend Krista owed
2223260	2227180	us money for our hotel room, so she came back from Japan with a copy of Dracula X for me
2227180	2229300	and called it even.
2229300	2232300	She owed us about $120 and gave us the game.
2232300	2233380	There you go.
2233380	2234860	So I have a pretty copy of the game.
2234860	2236060	Oh my God, this is so hot.
2236060	2238700	All right, we've got to get to some other games real quick, though, that I got to play.
2238700	2243460	Honeycomb Beat was another game I played on the DS.
2243460	2246380	What I like about this puzzle game is it�s kind of different from anything I�ve played.
2246380	2247700	It�s not like anything on PopCap.
2247700	2249460	It uses a stylus.
2249460	2253260	Basically the grid looks like there�s a puzzle mode and a progressive, you know, lines
2253260	2254540	going up the screen mode.
2254540	2260940	And basically when you tap the DS stylus on the screen, you flip over all the honeycombs
2260940	2264540	around the one that you hit, and so that�s kind of like how the puzzle works.
2264540	2266540	You�re trying to make lines of solid colors.
2266540	2270460	So it�s one of those easy concept but repeat playability.
2270460	2274180	Unfortunately there was no sound, so it�s hard for me to judge, like, does it have good
2274180	2275180	music?
2275180	2276900	I mean, is this game called Honeycomb Beat?
2276900	2278780	But it doesn�t really look like the music plays into it at all.
2278780	2282580	I think beat is just what they call tapping the screen to flip all the things over.
2282580	2286740	But I think if the price is right on this game, it could be a really good value buy,
2286740	2287740	I think.
2287740	2291020	It�s a good solid puzzle game that�s something we haven�t played before.
2291020	2294820	What�s also going to be a good value is Konami Classics.
2294820	2299540	The full name of this game on the Nintendo DS is Konami Classics Series Arcades Hits,
2299540	2300660	but we�ll just call it Konami Classics.
2300660	2302900	It�s 15 arcade games.
2302900	2303900	Essentially it�s MAME on your DS.
2303900	2306060	I don�t know a better way to describe it.
2306060	2311740	Contra, Gradius, Circus Charlie, Puyan, like all these really, just frankly some obscure
2311740	2312740	games.
2312740	2315500	I remember Puyan because it was a game I played on the Commodore 64.
2315500	2320840	But get this, all the actions on the top screen, but when you pause the game or you tap things
2320840	2325340	on the bottom screen, not only does the bottom screen show you like the old arcade how to
2325340	2329020	play banners, which I think is great, like those old things you used to see, like when
2329020	2332500	you press the button, your thing will fly or whatever it is.
2332500	2339140	You can also flip the top screen so that you can play in like brain training style mode,
2339140	2341460	you know, where you�re holding the DS vertically.
2341460	2344940	So for a more vertically oriented game like Puyan, it works great because you don�t
2344940	2349140	really stretch the screen like you do if you�re trying to squish it into the more horizontal.
2349140	2350980	So I thought that was a really smart idea.
2350980	2355820	So that�s going to be a pretty good value, although granted if you�re an Xbox 360 owner,
2355820	2360540	a lot of these games you�ve seen on live or probably will be seen on live a little
2360540	2361540	later.
2361540	2366360	So a lot of those same games, but you get them on the go on the DS.
2366360	2376820	The next one I played is the game I can�t pronounce, Kororimpa, Marble Mania on the
2376820	2377860	Nintendo Wii.
2377860	2381540	Okay, you remember those old things they had back when we were kids, like those little
2381540	2385720	marble mazes where you would turn the knobs left and right to move the marble around,
2385720	2388260	but you didn�t want them to fall in the holes, like you tried to get it all the way
2388260	2389260	to the end?
2389260	2391560	That�s this game on the Wii.
2391560	2396740	You tilt the Wii remote to tilt the grid around, and so you could say in that sense it�s
2396740	2401220	kind of like Marble Blast Ultra because there�s, you know, like things that get in the way.
2401220	2406180	Like one round that we played had these giant scissors that closed on the course and you
2406180	2407660	didn�t want your ball to be in there.
2407660	2412060	And by the way, your ball could either be a little steel ball, you could be like a soccer
2412060	2415860	ball, a basketball, or a little penguin ball, of course that�s the one I had to play with.
2415860	2419420	Not a monkey ball, that�s a different game, I�m sorry, but this game is kind of like
2419420	2423260	monkey ball I guess, but I actually felt this game controlled a little better than monkey
2423260	2424260	ball did.
2424260	2427380	I felt the controls were a little more polished on this game.
2427380	2431940	So I think if it�s released at a lower price point than your typical Wii game, I think
2431940	2432940	it�ll be a good buy.
2432940	2436040	It has multiplayer, and what�s interesting about multiplayer is you only need one Wii
2436040	2440740	remote because one person uses the Wii, one person uses the nunchuck to control because
2440740	2444780	you don�t really use buttons or anything, you just tilt the Wiimote around, which is
2444780	2446720	kind of interesting.
2446720	2447720	That was that game.
2447720	2454980	And then Brooktown High was the last thing I played on the PSP, and Brooktown High is
2454980	2457060	kind of a dating sim game.
2457060	2462020	It�s Konami basically trying to, what�s that game they had in Japan, Tokenshi Memorial
2462020	2468300	or what the, Tokimeki Memorial that they have over in Japan, this is them trying this in
2468300	2472880	the U.S., because you know, Konami sometimes takes a while to try things out that are successful
2472880	2476620	in Japan over in the U.S., like DDR, but this is them trying that.
2476620	2482100	And I gotta be honest, I don�t know if this is something I�d buy, but I played another
2482100	2485700	dating sim called Sprung, which is one of the most god-awful games I�ve ever played
2485700	2489380	in my life on the Nintendo DS, and this game was leaps and bounds better than that.
2489380	2492860	So as far as dating sims go, it wasn�t that bad, but I just don�t know if it�s the
2492860	2494100	kind of game I�m into.
2494100	2499100	I did like it�s very customizable, you can kind of tell it, you know, what sort of girls
2499100	2503980	you like and what your personality is like, and you can do a guy dating girls or a girl
2503980	2505420	dating guys.
2505420	2510500	Of course you haven�t seen the guys dating guys, but I hear it might be an Easter egg,
2510500	2516820	but I didn�t get anything official from the developers of the game, but regardless,
2516820	2522020	you can kind of get your character�s personality built by attending class and by the dialogues
2522020	2523020	you have.
2523020	2527200	Like I know they were saying things about if you claim to be a philosopher to impress
2527200	2531780	a girl, she might call you out on it and ask you a question about philosophy, and if you
2531780	2534540	don�t know the answer, you�re kind of screwed and you lose cool points with her.
2534540	2537580	So there are little things like that that are kind of interesting.
2537580	2542180	And I also thought it was interesting that they had like booth babes there promoting
2542180	2543180	Brooktown.
2543180	2547380	It was the only thing they kind of went out and did all these little cheers.
2547380	2550700	They really went all out for promoting that particular game at the show, which I thought
2550700	2551700	was interesting.
2551700	2552700	Yes, Dark Sakura.
2552700	2555700	I�m totally cosplaying Annette�s outfit.
2555700	2557420	What, from Castlevania?
2557420	2558420	Yeah.
2558420	2560980	Thank you for having nothing to do with what I just said.
2560980	2561980	No, I�m sorry.
2561980	2565020	I was still looking at � they had some of the promo art up on GameSpy.
2565020	2566020	Oh, that�s fine.
2566020	2572700	I played the Brooktown a little bit, and you know, the only thing that�s disappointing
2572700	2578900	is having played all the hentai, you know, dating sims out there.
2578900	2579900	I did like �
2579900	2580900	What?
2580900	2581900	You wanted to see 16-year-old Titty?
2581900	2582900	That�s gross.
2582900	2583900	No, no.
2583900	2591980	I hope it had in the game � did you notice in the trailer they had kind of all the symbols
2591980	2597980	for sex in there, like the rocket taking off and like the oil well going �
2597980	2598980	Oh, yeah.
2598980	2600620	I hope the god that�s in the game �
2600620	2605420	They did this weird-ass thing in the trailer where suddenly pictures of the game were replaced
2605420	2612180	with these real-life imageries of a flower blooming and a rocket taking off and all this
2612180	2613180	crazy stuff.
2613180	2617300	I hope that like, you know, if you go in for a hot coffee or something like that, you know,
2617300	2618300	that �
2618300	2621540	This is going to be really random, but did you see the new Psycho?
2621540	2627540	Like remember when Gus Van Sant remade Psycho, like in 1998 or something, he remade Psycho?
2627540	2633820	One of the things he did in the death scenes, he added these random-ass clips that had nothing
2633820	2634820	to do with it.
2634820	2639580	Like when one person is getting stabbed, like you see a train going through a tunnel and
2639580	2642500	like the clouds moving by in the sky and it�s like all this random shit.
2642500	2647100	That�s what that reminded me of, I mean, seriously.
2647100	2653580	Anyway, that was Brooktown.
2653580	2657380	Is Chat Room giving you a hard time for being stuck on a Castlevania Dark Sakura?
2657380	2658380	I don�t care.
2658380	2666460	I did want to mention that Korinpa and Wing Island are both going to retail for $40 instead
2666460	2667460	of $50.
2667460	2668460	Oh, cool.
2668460	2670660	You picked that up through your distribution thing because they didn�t say that at the
2670660	2671660	show.
2671660	2676900	Yeah, I picked it up, you know, I think I mentioned it maybe last week, whatever, but
2676900	2678900	yeah.
2678900	2682860	Other games at the show that they had, Death Junior Science Fair of Doom on the DS.
2682860	2684460	I didn�t see it there.
2684460	2685460	It was playable.
2685460	2686740	It�s just not a lot of people were playing it.
2686740	2688300	Sorry, Death Junior fans.
2688300	2691220	Go Pets on the Nintendo DS, which is interfaces with the PC.
2691220	2694600	It�s a DS and PC game, which I thought was interesting.
2694600	2697420	It looked to me like a cross between Animal Crossing and Nintendogs.
2697420	2701460	Jamie, you�d probably love this game.
2701460	2703040	I might love this game.
2703040	2704040	It looked interesting.
2704040	2707100	The graphics looked a little rough, but it might have just been early stages.
2707100	2709380	They didn�t have it playable, just the preview.
2709380	2712420	Let�s see, you talked about Hellboy already, right?
2712420	2713420	Yeah.
2713420	2714540	Lost in Blue 2.
2714540	2715540	I didn�t like the first one.
2715540	2716540	I didn�t care about the second one.
2716540	2717540	Sorry.
2717540	2722900	I played some of the mini-games, like the goat milking and the � no.
2722900	2726660	It looks literally exactly like the first one.
2726660	2730540	Lunar Nights, which we told you about at the F1 with Konami BBQ.
2730540	2737740	It looks pretty cool still, and Winning Eleven Pro Evo Soccer 2007 looked awesome on the
2737740	2738740	360.
2738740	2741100	That game looked � even on the PS2, it looked good.
2741100	2744500	It looks awesome, but to be honest, I couldn�t get too excited about it because it�s coming
2744500	2745500	out next week.
2745500	2750300	I mean, it�s like, why even waste the space with this game?
2750300	2752740	I mean, it�s coming out next week.
2752740	2753740	I mean, who cares?
2753740	2754740	It looked good, though.
2754740	2755740	I mean, it�s really nice looking.
2755740	2757140	I don�t really play a lot of sports games.
2757140	2758540	I�m thinking about picking this one up.
2758540	2759540	It looks that good.
2759540	2760540	So, I don�t know.
2760540	2761540	We�ll see.
2761540	2766460	Anyway, but we can�t end this story without saying something about the games that weren�t
2766460	2767460	there.
2767460	2769060	Of course, Metal Gear Solid 4.
2769060	2774160	We thought maybe we�d see another trailer, a playable demo, maybe, but nothing, nothing.
2774160	2779040	No Silent Hill 5, no Silent Hill Origins, no Coded Arms on the PlayStation 3, which
2779040	2782620	means it is probably true that the game was canceled, we�re thinking, or at least heavily
2782620	2783620	delayed.
2783620	2787280	Silent Hill Origins on the PSP vanished into thin air, just like most things in Silent
2787280	2788280	Hill.
2788280	2792920	So, very interesting what they didn�t show as much as what they did show.
2792920	2796660	What do you think about the lineup of Konami Gamers� Day overall, low-key, from being
2796660	2797860	at the show?
2797860	2800240	Make more console games.
2800240	2801740	Stop with all the portable games.
2801740	2802740	It was very interesting.
2802740	2808180	Remember when the first marketing lady, or whoever was up there, and I apologize I don�t
2808180	2812560	have my notes in front of you, she said something about that that�s where all the money is
2812560	2813560	right now.
2813560	2814560	Is that DS and PSP?
2814560	2816860	No, that�s not exactly true though.
2816860	2818980	Make some more 360 games.
2818980	2823640	Granted, they had two last year.
2823640	2834680	They had Rumble Roses XX, and then the follow-up Smash Hit Bomberman, two really awesome games
2834680	2841280	for the 360, and then this year they�ve got Hellboy, which Hellboy looks good, I�ll
2841280	2843860	give them that, and DDR Universe.
2843860	2850160	But put some more games on the 360, oh and I guess Winning Eleven Soccer, that�s great.
2850160	2851160	So three games this year.
2851160	2853320	I definitely don�t think we�ve seen everything for the year though.
2853320	2856920	This is what we� I mean, if you think about last year, we�ve only seen what�s coming
2856920	2860920	out through like summer, except for some of the DDR Wii won�t be out until the end of
2860920	2863880	the year, and some of those other ones, but most of the stuff is going to be out in summer.
2863880	2867000	Most of what they showed was going to be out in March, and I think we already talked about
2867000	2872000	most of that, but I mean, oh goody, so we�re going to see Karaoke Revolution, whatever
2872000	2874920	the next one is, on the 360 come fall.
2874920	2879520	SSJ100Matt says, �Kojima probably wants to take his time with Metal Gear Solid 4 since
2879520	2882400	it�s his last one.� Yeah, he says that every time, dude.
2882400	2883960	He says that every time.
2883960	2886320	Bullseye is his last one.
2886320	2887760	There�s money to be made.
2887760	2888760	He�ll come back.
2888760	2892560	Jamie, I know unfortunately you didn�t get to go because of school, but what do you think
2892560	2895560	from the perspective of getting to read all about this?
2895560	2899480	Are you excited about all this, or beyond just Castlevania?
2899480	2901440	Dracula X.
2901440	2906000	I really don�t care about anything but Dracula X, really.
2906000	2907000	Nothing in the world.
2907000	2913680	No Super Bowl, no Koro Impa.
2913680	2922240	That one sounds interesting, but my excitement over Dracula X is phenomenal, monumental,
2922240	2927800	bigger than a mole in terms of chemistry.
2927800	2929600	The creator of Castlevania was there.
2929600	2930600	I know it.
2930600	2931600	I hugged him.
2931600	2932600	He is still a fucking rock star.
2932600	2933600	I hugged him.
2933600	2936440	He came out and said, �I got a new hat.� Put on his new hat.
2936440	2938240	I have a picture of him, remember?
2938240	2939240	Yeah, I know.
2939240	2940240	We ran into him in E3.
2940240	2941240	I remember that.
2941240	2942240	I know.
2942240	2943240	I have all the celebrity run-ins.
2943240	2947480	I want to mention some things that slipped under that most people didn�t talk about.
2947480	2952360	There were some of the new lineups that they set for their plug-and-play stuff.
2952360	2956560	One of them, which was really big and I�m surprised I didn�t pick, Music Mania, which
2956560	2960160	I don�t know if it�s Beat Mania or pop music or something, but they have a three
2960160	2964240	and five key mode, and it�s basically a music rhythm game.
2964240	2965240	Even I missed this.
2965240	2968920	It was on the CD with the press stuff.
2968920	2971240	We�ll have to do a write-up on that and look at that.
2971240	2972560	What about the track and field?
2972560	2977680	I thought they have a plug-and-go track and field guild, like a power pad, old NES type
2977680	2978680	thing.
2978680	2979680	Very interesting.
2979680	2980680	I guess you could burn a lot of calories with that.
2980680	2982680	That�s what they�re encouraging.
2982680	2989280	Speaking of burning calories and also DDR, there was a study going on by the West Virginia
2989280	2995800	Public Employees Insurance Agency where they had, it was a 24-week at-home clinical study
2995800	3001960	where they had people play DDR five days a week for at least 30 minutes and record their
3001960	3002960	activity.
3002960	3003960	They had to help monitors.
3003960	3010360	They were tracking weight, blood pressure, arterial function, fitness level, BMI, and
3010360	3014220	general attitude toward exercise.
3014220	3019440	These studies came by, and see, all their studies, by the way, were above the 85th percent
3019440	3023320	offer body mass index.
3023320	3030240	Not all of them lost weight, but almost all of them were showing improved arterial function.
3030240	3035160	They were showing general levels of well-being improved.
3035160	3041800	The biggest thing on here, I thought, was confidence and self-esteem improved.
3041800	3046860	They were more willing to participate in activity because they were so active and had more faith
3046860	3049400	in their bodies and their capabilities.
3049400	3054740	In other words, it took this big study to prove that exercise, no matter in what form
3054740	3063120	it is, DDR or weightlifting or whatever it is, exercise is healthy?
3063120	3069360	We know exercise is healthy, but I think that taking something that makes it really fun
3069360	3077760	because in the average person's mind, I think, they're not going to see, oh, I'm exercising.
3077760	3081800	I can tell you from personal experience, I get weirded out with the idea of going to
3081800	3082800	the gym.
3082800	3088680	There's something about that whole public sweating thing and the whole body builders.
3088680	3090340	There's all those muscular people and everything.
3090340	3093840	There's kind of that big fear that kind of goes with the gym and intimidation that comes
3093840	3094840	with that.
3094840	3098680	You don't have that when you're playing DDR because it's like just playing a video game.
3098680	3102240	Even though there's a whole different side of it, like if you're playing at the arcade,
3102240	3105400	people call you gay or whatever, but fuck them.
3105400	3107720	It's about the fact that you're having fun with it.
3107720	3108720	I haven't kicked out.
3108720	3109720	I know.
3109720	3110720	That was the good old days at Roseville Golf Land.
3110720	3111720	We all used to go.
3111720	3114400	But, anyway, DDR is kind of different than that.
3114400	3115680	DDR is just kind of like having fun.
3115680	3118200	It's like, hey, we're playing a video game, making asses of ourselves.
3118200	3119200	That's funny.
3119200	3120200	It's healthy.
3120200	3121200	I miss Para Para.
3121200	3122200	Oh, yeah.
3122200	3123680	That was a good one, too.
3123680	3127880	I think the Para Para was more of a good aerobic workout than just DDR is because you
3127880	3129680	move in your arms with it.
3129680	3130680	It's a lot more.
3130680	3133000	Well, maybe that's what they hope to accomplish with this Wii thing.
3133000	3137920	Well, at any rate, there's a little bit more to this that I think is cool is the Office
3137920	3140200	of West Virginia Governor.
3140200	3145800	Actually, it looks like there's an association with the Department of Education and a few
3145800	3153240	other facilities, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield, are giving some financial support
3153240	3159920	to eventually lead this into DDR games, training PE teachers, and promoting DDR clubs in West
3159920	3162440	Virginia public schools.
3162440	3166440	And Konami gets all the profits, but that's okay because it keeps new DDR games coming
3166440	3169160	out at home, and as long as they stay innovative, hey, they're fine by me.
3169160	3174000	I just laugh for all those people who say, oh, DDR won't work in America.
3174000	3177960	I bet you feel so stupid now.
3177960	3179160	Well, you know what?
3179160	3182440	This news is so huge that they even covered it on the national news.
3182440	3183440	Did you hear that?
3183440	3184440	Really?
3184440	3185440	Yes.
3185440	3186440	I have a clip.
3186440	3187440	Hold on.
3187440	3192880	Researchers in West Virginia announced Friday the results of a study that suggests playing
3192880	3198920	the video game Dance Dance Revolution improves the health of overweight kids, though not
3198920	3202720	as much as its rival game, Hamburger on a String.
3202720	3203720	Okay.
3203720	3207840	Obviously, that was from Saturday Night Live.
3207840	3211880	It's still kind of funny, nonetheless, to see a little DDR joke make its way into Weekend
3211880	3212880	Update there.
3212880	3213880	I like Hamburger on a String.
3213880	3214880	And who doesn't love?
3214880	3216680	I miss Kevin Nealon doing the Weekend Update.
3216680	3218920	Yeah, but I love Amy Poehler.
3218920	3219920	I love her.
3219920	3220920	She's fine.
3220920	3221920	Not as good as Tina Fey, but I love her.
3221920	3222920	She was with Upright Citizens Brigade.
3222920	3223920	But anyway.
3223920	3224920	Hamburger on a String.
3224920	3225920	Ha!
3225920	3226920	I miss Chevy Chase, too.
3226920	3227920	I know.
3227920	3233000	So, you know, we all know that the PlayStation 3 resembles a George Foreman grill or a grill
3233000	3234000	of some sort.
3234000	3235000	Yeah.
3235000	3237560	In fact, people have gone as far as making it into an actual grill.
3237560	3247000	Well, now there's this one retailer in Akihabara that's selling some unofficial 6-axis soy
3247000	3249760	sauce to go with the PlayStation 3 grill.
3249760	3251720	That's kind of a joke.
3251720	3259960	They've basically rebranded some of the Bulldog brand soy sauce and, yeah, it's actually quite
3259960	3260960	funny.
3260960	3266280	They feature it in the smaller 20GB size or the larger 60GB size.
3266280	3270080	Is it $599 US dollars?
3270080	3271560	Is it made from giant enemy crabs?
3271560	3272560	No.
3272560	3274280	All these jokes will never get old.
3274280	3283080	It's actually, it's being sold at Sagatsu Isagi and it's being retailed for 3.99 yen
3283080	3288760	marked down from 4.99 yen and 5.99 yen for the larger one.
3288760	3293080	And it's kind of funny, though, because it has a picture of Ken Kataragi on the front
3293080	3294080	there.
3294080	3295080	Eating crabs?
3295080	3296080	And it also has a picture of...
3296080	3300480	The PlayStation 3 with the top lifted up with the grill on it.
3300480	3304200	To be honest, I think that would be pretty cool if there was a grill on it because then
3304200	3310160	you could eat and watch a Blu-ray movie at the same time.
3310160	3318680	If anyone doesn't know, Akihabara is the technical district, I guess, where you can buy all of
3318680	3322000	your techie goods and now barbecue sauce.
3322000	3325400	I really want to buy barbecue sauce when I go buy a stereo.
3325400	3330840	DJ Jenai says, 6-axis equals most innovative controller ever.
3330840	3333240	PS3 is the best.
3333240	3337960	Glad to know we have some Sony fans in chat because sometimes it feels like there are
3337960	3343040	no Sony fans left in the world, so I'm glad to see somebody is still standing behind them.
3343040	3346520	Anyhow, certainly these guys are fans of Sony.
3346520	3352320	They just express their fanboyism in a different way because it's, let's see, who did this?
3352320	3360520	On the first day that firmware 3.10 came out, it got cracked.
3360520	3361520	That's kind of funny.
3361520	3366740	This was cracked by team C plus D and basically what happened is that of course they released
3366740	3370720	the new firmware just a few days ago and it got cracked right in the same day by this
3370720	3375240	team who works hard to crack the games, I'm sorry, to crack the firmware so that you can
3375240	3378600	still continue to play your old school Nintendo games on your PS3.
3378600	3389520	And they've already come out with custom firmware for 3.1, so great, now you can actually install
3389520	3394360	the custom firmware, play all your updated games, and still be able to play your wonderful
3394360	3397120	NES ROMs.
3397120	3402760	DJ Jenai says, continuous is Sony fanboyism, saying, come on, Sony does what Nintendon't,
3402760	3408800	the Rob D counters with, everyone stands behind Sony, to laugh at them behind their back.
3408800	3414440	Rama says, I'll wait for the PS3 to be redesigned in retail for $149, give it six more months.
3414440	3415440	Ouch.
3415440	3421360	All right, any more PlayStation stories?
3421360	3424280	I suppose I have some information.
3424280	3425280	Okay.
3425280	3426280	Some.
3426280	3433120	Well, there's a little game that spawned a very interesting little music video called
3433120	3436120	Saints Row.
3436120	3442360	It's been confirmed that it will be going on to PS3, it's saying that sometime this
3442360	3450280	spring it will have PlayStation Network support, and so that means multiplayer online.
3450280	3456800	There was a mention, however, if they're going to have any additional content.
3456800	3463240	Speaking of Saints Row, and that game had some CD parts in it, well, if you happen to
3463240	3469560	be in some of the CD parts of Japan, you too can play the PlayStation 3 in one of Japan's
3469560	3475000	love hotels, and yes, that is one of those brothel hotels.
3475000	3485880	Casa Di Du in Shibuya, Tokyo, they have, with, I guess, your stay at these love hotels, you
3485880	3490620	can be able to play PlayStation 3 for free.
3490620	3495440	So I guess that's great, but at the same time, you know, I would be thinking, if you're staying
3495440	3500480	at a love hotel, wouldn't you be going there for sex and not to play the PlayStation 3?
3500480	3504920	Or is Sony trying to tell me the PlayStation 3 is better than sex?
3504920	3508520	Or is it one of those things where it's like, okay, I'm going here, and not only will I
3508520	3512700	get a hot chick to sleep with me, or borderline hot chick to sleep with me, but she'll play
3512700	3513700	games with me?
3513700	3516240	Well, love hotels aren't really just that.
3516240	3522280	They're also where people meet for rendezvous with their significant other.
3522280	3529760	And then all she would have to do is bake me a pie, and it's like the full thing.
3529760	3531280	I just wanted to get the death glare from Jamie.
3531280	3533880	I thought that was interesting, though.
3533880	3540280	I mean, I guess that's pretty cool, because after you've done it, then you can play video
3540280	3541280	games.
3541280	3544320	And it's just like you never left home.
3544320	3548960	Going back to a previous story in chat, reading some comments here, Mike W. says, it was decrypted
3548960	3551400	day one, talking about the firmware.
3551400	3552400	Then it was cracked.
3552400	3553400	Fault story, whatever.
3553400	3558440	I don't care if OLR gets it wrong.
3558440	3563840	Regardless, having the firmware get fucked with on day one, and having some form of security,
3563840	3568600	to obsess with it, whether it be decryption or whatever it is, has got to say something.
3568600	3573120	And it didn't take much longer after that, anyway.
3573120	3577600	Ramas Bolden says, PlayStation 3 equals Sony's final console.
3577600	3581920	The Rob D says, what would you listen to in a love hotel while playing video games?
3581920	3584840	I want you to watch me play Madden Skip from Mad TV.
3584840	3590280	I don't know if you've ever seen that, but it's kind of funny.
3590280	3593960	Ravens Dolphin says, Loki is going there with Nelly to a love hotel.
3593960	3596720	No, I wouldn't be going there.
3596720	3600720	Why would I travel all the way to Japan to go to a love hotel?
3600720	3601720	That's ridiculous.
3601720	3602720	All right.
3602720	3610640	Well, speaking of good lovin', there's this interesting thing here in Utah.
3610640	3615960	They have that games as porn bill that keeps trying to pass over and over again.
3615960	3622480	Well, unfortunately, the State House Committee of Utah voted to hold the legislation for
3622480	3627840	the third time the other day, and the reason is freedom of speech.
3627840	3632400	So of course, what they were trying to do is try to change it to say that Utah was going
3632400	3636080	to be basically had to be sold as like pornography does.
3636080	3640640	Let's see, Republican Kay McCliff had this to say, I am concerned when all the legal
3640640	3645020	experts including our own Attorney General as well as the sponsor tell us that the bill
3645020	3649160	is likely to fail in a constitutional challenge, one where we cannot control the amount we
3649160	3652840	spend because we spend our side and then we are potentially obliged to spend the legal
3652840	3654760	costs of the other side.
3654760	3659360	Kay is trying to draft a substitute bill to replace the original.
3659360	3660360	Leave it to a Republican.
3660360	3664000	Well, you know, I don't want to turn this into a political war, but it's just general
3664000	3668600	ignorance, I think, about the gaming community from everyone, and I think a lot of folks
3668600	3672140	could stand to be educated no matter who you are or how you vote.
3672140	3673140	I think a lot of-
3673140	3674140	But mostly Republicans.
3674140	3675600	I think a lot of people just don't get it.
3675600	3678280	I'm just giving y'all a hard time.
3678280	3679280	All right.
3679280	3683840	Well, but there is- I have some- I do have some news about someone who has his head up
3683840	3689120	his ass that makes me happy, speaking of, you know, Republicans.
3689120	3692680	Sorry, I won't go off on Republicans anymore.
3692680	3699840	There- Okay, sorry, there was some debate going on.
3699840	3701840	Can we start over, please?
3701840	3702840	Yes.
3702840	3703840	Okay, thank you.
3703840	3711680	Um, speaking of someone who has, uh, his head up his ass, um, he who shall not be named
3711680	3717800	except right now, Jack Thompson, um, has been, um, called on yet another complaint with the
3717800	3719800	Florida Bar.
3719800	3723240	Um, it's- Oh my God.
3723240	3729400	Anyway, there's a pending judicial review, um, for five counts of professional misconduct
3729400	3732600	against, uh, dumbass.
3732600	3736920	I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be, you know, impersonal, right, um, against, uh, he who shall not be
3736920	3742320	named to be, um, actually he's supposed to be going to the, uh, State Supreme Court,
3742320	3744440	uh, for, uh, action.
3744440	3745440	That's pretty cool.
3745440	3751040	But the, uh, quote on here, um, says, uh, in the suit, uh, he who shall not be named
3751040	3755800	represented the families of two Fayette, Alabama police officers and a police dispatcher murdered
3755800	3759120	by an 18-year-old grand theft auto player in 2003.
3759120	3762300	At the time of his arrest for the killings, Devin Moore reportedly said, life is like
3762300	3764920	a video game, you have to die sometime.
3764920	3768200	More subsequently convicted of the murders now sits on Alabama's death row.
3768200	3772760	He who shall not be named was not involved in the criminal case against Moore.
3772760	3780400	Um, yeah, honestly, the other, the other, um, two complaints actually have to do with,
3780400	3788520	um, the attacks he made, um, on shock radio in South Florida and, um, you know, I'm just
3788520	3789520	so disgusted.
3789520	3793760	Really, I, I hope that, I hope that he is disbarred.
3793760	3796800	I hope this is the end of it.
3796800	3799160	And we never- That would be awesome if we never had to report
3799160	3800160	on him again.
3800160	3802080	That would be the best thing ever.
3802080	3803080	I'd hold a party.
3803080	3806000	Uh, Rama and Shay, I think, I think we would- You know what?
3806000	3808280	If this happens, we should throw a party.
3808280	3809560	We absolutely should throw a party.
3809560	3816200	We have a special party edition of Orange Lounge Radio, um, celebrating the vanquishment
3816200	3817520	of he who shall not be named.
3817520	3818520	We'll get guests and everything.
3818520	3821560	I bet you anything, because, you know, gamer Andy was a big part of that flower and he
3821560	3822560	doesn't live that far away.
3822560	3824560	I bet you we could get him here to join our party.
3824560	3829280	We'll get, we'll invite some, we'll get, we'll hold a big, massive frickin' party if this
3829280	3830280	happens.
3830280	3831280	We'll play World Combat Armageddon.
3831280	3832280	Yes.
3832280	3833280	Custom characters.
3833280	3836520	We'll play nothing but video games where we put Jack Tonsom in them, Tonsom in them.
3836520	3838880	What about the, uh, the Combine game?
3838880	3840280	Sure, we'll play that too.
3840280	3841280	Why not?
3841280	3842280	We'll play that too.
3842280	3843880	And, and, and, and, and- That'll piss him off.
3843880	3847320	And our Music of Choice's Two Life crew and Ice-T.
3847320	3848320	Bring it on!
3848320	3849320	I love this idea!
3849320	3850320	You know what?
3850320	3851320	I think we should have this party anyway!
3851320	3856120	No, but we're, okay, the party only happens if he gets disbarred.
3856120	3857120	Okay?
3857120	3858280	Is that, is that the criteria?
3858280	3859840	If he gets disbarred- If he gets disbarred-
3859840	3864740	In the state of Florida, OLR, he lost his licensed party.
3864740	3867000	He who shall not be named is vanquished.
3867000	3872880	However, if he is not disbarred, we send him a bag of poo in the mail.
3872880	3873880	No, no, no.
3873880	3874880	We're not children.
3874880	3875880	Come on.
3875880	3881960	Maybe we could call this bar is open party.
3881960	3886520	Going to the chatroom, Rama says, isn't he who shall not be named Voldemort?
3886520	3889600	So should we start- So do you, do you see the metaphor here?
3889600	3893720	Should we start calling him Jack- Should that be his new nickname, Jack Voldemort?
3893720	3896560	Jack Voldemort.
3896560	3898080	I love that idea.
3898080	3899680	He is just he who shall not be named.
3899680	3902320	From here on out, we are calling him Jack Voldemort.
3902320	3903320	I love that idea.
3903320	3906840	And by the way, the reason why I brought up Two Life Crew and Ice-T is that he was also
3906840	3913040	instrumental in the whole, you know, the cop killer scandal for Ice-T and for Two Life
3913040	3916640	Crew's as nasty as they want to be.
3916640	3917640	Wasn't that what it was called?
3917640	3921760	And we'll also listen to Howard Stern because- Yes, we should copy it and send it to Howard
3921760	3923760	Stern.
3923760	3926440	Oh, I love this idea.
3926440	3927440	Here's hoping.
3927440	3930320	Would this all happen like next week if it happens?
3930320	3931320	I missed the dates in there.
3931320	3932320	I hope it happens.
3932320	3933920	I don't think the dates were listed.
3933920	3935460	Everything in the legal thing is a slow process.
3935460	3936460	We'll see.
3936460	3937960	I'll have to check my legal sites.
3937960	3938960	All right.
3938960	3942120	Anyway, any time, you know, it's become tradition on this program.
3942120	3948440	Any time a story about Jack Voldemort comes up, you know what's going to happen next.
3948440	3952600	That's right.
3952600	3958680	It's our chance to rant about whatever we want.
3958680	3960240	It's the FUs of the week.
3960240	3961800	Get it out of your system, Darkstalker.
3961800	3963280	I have two.
3963280	3967000	The first one, FU to my uterus.
3967000	3974520	Next one is an FU to Roseville, Mitsubishi, you bastards.
3974520	3975520	Okay.
3975520	3977520	This is what happens.
3977520	3988200	My husband has a 2006 Lancer- Oh god, what Lancer does he have?
3988200	3989200	A rally art, sorry.
3989200	3992000	So it's like a model under the evolution.
3992000	3994920	It's a nice, nice car.
3994920	4000240	And he uses it to go to work, and he uses it, you know, sometimes for a couple of Bay
4000240	4001240	Area trips.
4001240	4003120	He doesn't drive it really crazily.
4003120	4009800	I drive more violently than he does, and my car is still in good shape.
4009800	4012600	Well, the transmission blew.
4012600	4017880	And he had, you know, a car with only 15,000 miles on it, he's only had it for a year.
4017880	4020720	There's no reason for a transmission to go out that quickly.
4020720	4025200	So he took it to Roseville, Mitsubishi.
4025200	4030280	And Bob Coffee, what I was saying is that it's the step under the Evo.
4030280	4032280	Listen to what I said.
4032280	4033680	Hi.
4033680	4036360	And the FU to my uterus is for PMS.
4036360	4040680	But anyway, back to the car.
4040680	4052040	When he took it in, this was, the car first of all has the 10 year warranty on it, bumper
4052040	4053920	to bumper warranty.
4053920	4059760	So he took the car in, and they said, well, you know, we have to strip it down to look
4059760	4064080	at the transmission, and if it's your fault, you pay $1100 to fix it.
4064080	4069640	Well, first of all, if you don't drive your car like shit, then there's no reason for
4069640	4071920	the transmission to go out.
4071920	4078000	So he said, to hell with that, and said, you're not going to charge me for taking it apart,
4078000	4079760	you're going to do the diagnostic on it.
4079760	4082160	Like fine, then the warranty won't cover it.
4082160	4090120	So he gets on the line with the, I guess the Mitsubishi corporate, they have a big stink
4090120	4091120	over it.
4091120	4099000	He said the customer service girl was friendly, but said that the caseworker was all like,
4099000	4104320	hey look, we're going to have them break down the car for free, it's our dime, which they
4104320	4107960	should have done in the first place, hi!
4107960	4114680	And then they said if they determine the transmission thing is his fault, then they'll put it back
4114680	4119760	together for free, and let him take it wherever he feels that he needs to to pay less for
4119760	4120760	it.
4120760	4131120	So, if I start talking about how much I love my new WRX STI, you'll find out what happened.
4131120	4135280	We had some, I'm reading comments from chat, we had someone named the uterus join chat,
4135280	4138080	that says don't let your uterus drive your car.
4138080	4141640	And Rama says fucking cunt, and I'm going to say don't talk to Jamie like that, that's
4141640	4142640	rude.
4142640	4143640	Can I talk to, no, no, no.
4143640	4146520	I know, he was saying someone else.
4146520	4150480	Let's see, and then also, but Rama did say this, which I thought was really funny.
4150480	4156000	He said, so if Jack equals Voldemort, that means that Jamie equals Hermione, Sky equals
4156000	4157720	Harry, and Loki equals Ron.
4157720	4164520	Dude, that means that I get Victor Crumb, and then the movie gets kind of hot.
4164520	4166160	What do I get, Cho Chang?
4166160	4170280	Hippity doo da, alright, anyway, was that it?
4170280	4171280	Are you and your uterus done?
4171280	4176160	Except she was really cool with this being, having that thick Scottish accent, I totally
4176160	4177160	did it, it's perfect.
4177160	4179960	Are you and your uterus finished?
4179960	4184280	I wish that men had cramps.
4184280	4186600	We do get cramps in a different story.
4186600	4191840	I wish that men had hormone related cramps.
4191840	4195240	I would love it.
4195240	4196560	Maybe someday you can have balls.
4196560	4197960	You'd all be big babies.
4197960	4199600	And so I can kick you in them.
4199600	4204840	Alright, uh, Loki, well I wish we could drive better, but we don't always get what we want,
4204840	4205840	do we now?
4205840	4206840	You know what?
4206840	4207840	Fuck you.
4207840	4212200	We did figure out why, we did figure out though why women drive bad, it's because estrogen
4212200	4217200	causes you to have, you know, I don't know, some sort of balance problems, or like, you
4217200	4221840	know, the world spins or something, I don't know, we're just going to use that as an excuse
4221840	4222840	for now.
4222840	4223840	I drive really well.
4223840	4225120	There's going to be a fight in the parking lot after the show.
4225120	4226120	I drive rough.
4226120	4227120	What?
4227120	4229440	I drive really well.
4229440	4234120	You drive like a bat out of hell, I mean, you do get us from point A to point B the
4234120	4235120	quickest way possible.
4235120	4236120	I'll give you that.
4236120	4242200	But, I don't cut people off, I don't talk on my phone while I drive, I'm like somebody
4242200	4243200	in this room.
4243200	4245560	You cast hexes on people when you drive.
4245560	4247720	And they get out of my way.
4247720	4248720	Loki, finish.
4248720	4257080	Um, I don't even remember what my FU of the week was to, uh, so yeah, I'm just going to
4257080	4261640	say bad to women drivers because there's been a lot of them, especially driving slow or
4261640	4266440	that, you know, they can't seem to, you know, navigate that minivan, you know, it's like
4266440	4269440	if you can't fucking drive a car, just stay at home.
4269440	4275280	Just fuck everybody who drives a minivan that doesn't need one of those.
4275280	4280720	And I swear to god I fucking hate people that drive, you know, SUVs, off-road vehicles,
4280720	4285800	mind you, that have to go over the fucking speed bumps like it's, like their car's made
4285800	4286800	of glass.
4286800	4290280	It's a fucking off-road car, it should be able to handle this damn little speed bump.
4290280	4292880	I know my car could go over that super fast.
4292880	4293880	Why can't yours?
4293880	4297240	Oh my god, I'm having to loop the music, we're going to six minutes here.
4297240	4299120	Actually, I have one, I have one more thing.
4299120	4300120	Oh goody.
4300120	4301120	I have one more.
4301120	4302120	Alright.
4302120	4305000	FU to people who think that just because you're married you need to start breeding.
4305000	4306000	Moooo.
4306000	4307000	Moooo.
4307000	4313840	First of all, children do not save a marriage.
4313840	4315400	It makes it worse.
4315400	4318280	Secondly, if you can't afford...
4318280	4321680	This is episode part FU, because that's all this segment's going to be.
4321680	4325720	Secondly, if you cannot afford the child, don't have one.
4325720	4333440	Thirdly, if I say I don't want children, fucking respect what I have to say.
4333440	4337920	Don't keep pushing it until I go puke in the bathroom at Cattleman's.
4337920	4340560	Thank you.
4340560	4341560	Can I do my FUs now?
4341560	4342560	No.
4342560	4343560	Do I get to do my FUs?
4343560	4344560	Okay, fine.
4344560	4345560	Alright.
4345560	4349880	So my FU of the week also goes to Jamie's uterus, and then I would like to say an FU.
4349880	4350880	Just kidding.
4350880	4351880	Heart.
4351880	4352880	I don't think she heard me.
4352880	4353880	My uterus, my choice.
4353880	4356360	I would also like to give an FU, and it's my choice to say FU.
4356360	4357360	Just kidding.
4357360	4358360	Heart.
4358360	4359360	Love you.
4359360	4365200	No, seriously though, I want to say FU to dentistry, because oh my god, my dental bills.
4365200	4366720	And it's not like my teeth are that awful.
4366720	4370360	I don't think I have, like I've not got some crazy thing going on, like a gap or anything.
4370360	4374680	It's just like, oh my god, I have so much money, and I can't afford her dental stuff,
4374680	4376400	so it sucks.
4376400	4380320	And then I got like a temporary crown way in the back where you can't even see it, and
4380320	4381840	it fell out two days after I got it.
4381840	4382840	I mean, come on.
4382840	4386760	I just feel like every time, I feel like going to the dentist is like going to used car salesmen
4386760	4387760	sometimes.
4387760	4388760	There's so much pressure.
4388760	4389760	No wonder people are afraid of the dentist.
4389760	4390760	I'm not afraid of the dentist.
4390760	4391760	I just fall asleep.
4391760	4394080	It's not just, it's not the drill work I'm afraid of.
4394080	4395560	I'm afraid of the way they treat people.
4395560	4396560	Anyway.
4396560	4397560	You should go to my dentist.
4397560	4398560	She's really cool.
4398560	4399560	I don't think my insurance will let me.
4399560	4400560	That's a whole other FU.
4400560	4402560	FU to your testicles, by the way.
4402560	4403560	Thank you.
4403560	4405560	Oh, sure, sure, anytime.
4405560	4407560	FU, Jamie.
4407560	4410640	Thank god, this is radio.
4410640	4416880	Your testicles sound like Grover.
4416880	4422280	Well they're blue.
4422280	4426080	Welcome to octaves of Jamie that you normally don't listen.
4426080	4429880	I don't know if it's picking up because she doesn't have the mic near her, but she's going
4429880	4438040	to listen about three octaves higher than we usually hear.
4438040	4452600	On this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, giggling schoolgirls, near, far, near, far.
4452600	4454240	Thank god this is radio.
4454240	4461800	Speaking of near and far, one game that's near dear to my heart, Grand Theft Auto, is
4461800	4468080	doing really well far away in Japan, where Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has taken number
4468080	4470760	one in their sales charts.
4470760	4471760	That is right.
4471760	4475280	Beating out such DS titles as those brain training things.
4475280	4476280	Fuck brain training.
4476280	4477480	It's all about killing hookers.
4477480	4482600	That's really what Japan needs, and god damn it, they just got their dose of killing hookers.
4482600	4484320	So way to go Japan.
4484320	4487680	You just need to get on the bandwagon now with Grand Theft Auto IV, then I could be
4487680	4493160	killing more hookers from Japan.
4493160	4497640	Kevin DDR says, what, GTA can't do well in Japan?
4497640	4499000	It's doing well now.
4499000	4500000	It's number one.
4500000	4501840	But I mean, should that be such a big deal?
4501840	4502840	I mean, it's number one here.
4502840	4504680	Was it not allowed to do well in there?
4504680	4507560	Usually US games don't do very well in Japan.
4507560	4514080	So I would think, you know, that, you know.
4514080	4515320	Rob says, sounds like the OLR crew just got ahold of the wacky weed.
4515320	4516320	No, we don't.
4516320	4519160	I don't know about the other two, but I don't really do that.
4519160	4523840	Drinking's fine, but we're not drunk either tonight, and only when drinking responsibly.
4523840	4524840	So.
4524840	4525840	Rob.
4525840	4526840	Winners don't use drugs.
4526840	4527840	Remember the FBI warning.
4527840	4528840	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
4528840	4529840	What?
4529840	4530840	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
4530840	4531840	What?
4531840	4532840	Never do that again.
4532840	4535740	It was funny and you know it.
4535740	4536920	Never do that.
4536920	4545520	Speaking of blue things, Sonic the Hedgehog is, had a funny little misprint on Amazon
4545520	4549480	and a little screen shot made its way to Kotaku this week and they labeled the story Sonic
4549480	4555160	the Vacuum Cleaner because they put a little picture of Sonic the Hedgehog under Dirt Devil
4555160	4556520	Upright Vacuum.
4556520	4561000	Obviously this is some type of database mistake, but it makes people LOL nonetheless because
4561000	4563480	it's kind of funny to see things wrong like that.
4563480	4571120	Like remember when they were selling the Wii for like $1,119 or whatever was the release
4571120	4572120	date?
4572120	4573120	Somebody screwed up the database?
4573120	4574120	Something similar happened here.
4574120	4576000	Maybe they just found out that Sonic the Hedgehog sucked?
4576000	4577000	Haha!
4577000	4581280	I see what you did there because I hadn't heard that joke a million times already on
4581280	4584280	Kotaku.
4584280	4588540	Speaking of games that suck, Unexpected.
4588540	4590400	This is like totally rad.
4590400	4600080	The Burger King had, they reported higher than anticipated quarterly earnings because
4600080	4604140	of the Xbox 360 promo games, at least that's what they figured.
4604140	4611600	The games actually pulled sales up to $38 million in the US alone.
4611600	4618240	And so, how can these games have gone double platinum?
4618240	4621560	I guess with the fact that they were $4 a piece.
4621560	4626080	Because there are 2 million achievement point whores in the world who just needed the extra
4626080	4629160	600 points that these games would give is actually what happened.
4629160	4630160	I guess.
4630160	4633160	They are also now $0.99 each.
4633160	4635360	I heard about that, that's crazy.
4635360	4637000	So if you haven't bought them yet.
4637000	4639680	There are two that I still need, I only have Sneak King.
4639680	4644920	Yeah, if you haven't bought it yet, might as well do it, because $0.99, that's not bad
4644920	4645920	for a game.
4645920	4646920	Even if it does suck.
4646920	4648960	You can collect collector's things before too long.
4648960	4653560	It will be as rare as Rondo of Blood, okay maybe not.
4653560	4656960	But nowhere near as awesome.
4656960	4660680	Let's hear what games are coming out very soon that could soon become collector's items.
4660680	4663720	Do you have any exclusives for us this week, Loki, on release dates?
4663720	4670520	No, because I took time off work and there wasn't really much to mention anyway.
4670520	4674520	We mentioned everything probably last week and anything exclusive would have been at
4674520	4677560	Konami's Gamer Day and all that fun stuff.
4677560	4679640	What was I going to say though?
4679640	4682240	But this week though, there's some good stuff coming out.
4682240	4686600	If you are a fan of Winning Eleven, you'll be happy to know that that is finally making
4686600	4693240	its way out now on PlayStation 2, on the 360, DS, and PSP.
4693240	4695560	So that's pretty awesome.
4695560	4701520	Also there's going to be, actually there's not a lot of PlayStation 2 games coming out
4701520	4703760	this week, I know that for a fact.
4703760	4709500	I do believe the Final Fantasy VI comes out on the Game Boy Advance this week, which is
4709500	4712060	pretty awesome.
4712060	4717160	So definitely check that out, because I know, what is it, Five did really well, everybody's
4717160	4718640	picking up Five.
4718640	4725360	There should be some more Wii's and DS Lite's coming to, I want to say to all the retailers
4725360	4729600	this week as well, because I know they've been out of stock for a long time.
4729600	4735440	They were actually sold out on Nintendo for the last two weeks.
4735440	4742460	Other than that stuff, wow, it was just a whole lot of crap coming out this week.
4742460	4746320	So I want to say that's probably what I'd really, oh, how could I forget this, Diddycom
4746320	4748320	Racing DS, that's coming out.
4748320	4749320	So if you know.
4749320	4750320	I've been seeing commercials for that.
4750320	4755400	If you want to get your fix on a Mario Kart type racing game, and this is kind of cool,
4755400	4759400	they've got a create your own track mode, you basically draw a track with the stylus,
4759400	4765520	so that's kind of neat, R. Tonleko on Playstation 2, another Atlus RPG, so definitely worth
4765520	4766520	checking out.
4766520	4772200	If you're into puzzle games, Capcom Puzzle World on the PSP, so that was pretty fun,
4772200	4774280	because it has Puzzle Fighter on it.
4774280	4779800	Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI on Playstation 2, if you're a fan of that.
4779800	4784560	And then MVP07 NCAA Baseball if you're into college baseball on Playstation 2.
4784560	4787480	I just want to say release date wise, because I don't know if you explicitly stated this
4787480	4792000	on an earlier show, but we did confirm that DDR Universe is February 27th.
4792000	4794800	So almost March, but not quite.
4794800	4798520	And I'd also like to mention Lunar Nights on the DS is coming out this week.
4798520	4799520	Oh, very cool.
4799520	4803320	Good, that was a neat title, I might have to pick that up.
4803320	4806800	Coming out in Japan, we like to cover Japanese release dates too, because sometimes it's
4806800	4810680	kind of interesting to see what they get a lot later, and also what they get over there
4810680	4814240	now we may be getting over here pretty soon, and I wonder if this might be one of them
4814240	4818960	on the Xbox 360, they're getting a badly needed role playing game this week, because
4818960	4821720	you know Xbox kind of gets a lot of slack for not having a lot of choice when it comes
4821720	4822720	to role playing games.
4822720	4826160	I mean sure you have Phantasy Star, which is kind of borderline, and then you have Enchanted
4826160	4831780	Arms, but they're getting a new game this week from Type, or I'm sorry from Idea Factory,
4831780	4837340	it's called Diario Rebirth Moon Legend, it's a new RPG coming out on the Xbox 360, coming
4837340	4840160	out in Japan on the 8th.
4840160	4844880	It's coming out in Japan this week on the 8th, Fusion Frenzy 2 on the Xbox 360, coming
4844880	4850040	out on the Playstation 3, Virtua Fighter 5 makes it's way this week on February 8th,
4850040	4853720	that should be pretty cool, it's also coming out with a little stick, a Virtua stick is
4853720	4856160	coming out just for that game.
4856160	4866620	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, guess what Jamie, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai, that's
4866620	4872360	the subtitle for Cooking Mama on the Wii, coming out this week by Taito over there in Japan,
4872360	4879040	oh she's over here to correct me, my horrible pronunciations, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai,
4879040	4883040	I'm getting better, Taikai, give me that, I'm getting better, you're getting better,
4883040	4890520	alright and coming out on the Playstation 2, Outrun 2 is coming out, Stella Deuce, and
4890520	4898640	one of my favorite title names for this week coming from Capcom, Full House Kiss 2 is coming
4898640	4905960	out on the Playstation 2, and the cover for Full House Kiss 2, it's four guys all surrounding
4905960	4915320	a chick holding a bouquet, so you know what that means, they're all going to go banger.
4915320	4921320	Coming out on other systems, the Nintendo DS has Jet Impulse and Luminous Arc and Morita
4921320	4926320	Shogi on the DS, all coming out this week, and lastly do we have anything on the PSP,
4926320	4933120	we do, New Rainbow Island, Herdy Gurdy Daibuken is coming out this week, that should be tons
4933120	4939100	of fun I'm sure, I know, but it's kind of like, Bubble Bobble in general, like I remember
4939100	4942720	like the retro Bubble Bobble stuff used to be cool, but ever since that whole no boss
4942720	4947360	on level 30 thing I just, Rainbow Island, I'm burned down on that shit, Rondo of Blood,
4947360	4948360	alright anyway.
4948360	4955320	Okay, well, for our friends in the UK, there are some games coming out, which is a good
4955320	4961840	thing because games coming out, you know, is fun, we have coming out February 6th, War
4961840	4970120	Rock on PC, on the 8th, Sam & Max Episode 3, the Mole, the Mob, and the Meatball on PC,
4970120	4977160	on the 9th though, just a crap ton of games, Avatar the Last Airbender on damn near everything,
4977160	4984320	Battle Stations Midway, Battle Zone, Blade Dancer, Lineage of Light, Bomberman, Charlotte's
4984320	4992400	Web on a few things, Deep Labyrinth, Maelstrom, Magical Starsign, Metal Slug Anthology, Naruto,
4992400	4999560	Ultimate Ninja, Okami, scrolling down because I'm running out of room, Saint Seiya the Hades,
4999560	5005080	Space Empires V, The Professor's Brain Trainer, Logic, and Memory, The Sims Life Stories,
5005080	5010240	Thrillville, Totally Spies 2, Undercover, and that's it so far.
5010240	5013000	Did you say they're getting Okami this week?
5013000	5014160	Yeah, PlayStation 2.
5014160	5018600	Now since way too many people overlooked that game over here, I'm leaving it up to you folks
5018600	5023040	over in the UK to show Okami a little love so we make sure we get a sequel out of that
5023040	5024040	game.
5024040	5025040	Sound fair?
5025040	5026040	I didn't know there was a Saint Seiya game.
5026040	5029880	I don't think you're going to get a sequel since Clover Studios is gone.
5029880	5032800	Oh fuck, that's right, huh?
5032800	5034920	Lots of Metal Slug, everybody.
5034920	5035920	Lots of Metal Slug.
5035920	5039800	Okami's sequel is now sitting with my Guardian Legends sequel somewhere.
5039800	5041000	Cry.
5041000	5042240	Sob.
5042240	5043360	Leap.
5043360	5044520	QQ.
5044520	5051360	Anyways, one movie that doesn't really need to be made is definitely going to be spawned
5051360	5054960	from a game with lots of sequels, DOA the movie.
5054960	5058160	Apparently it was going to be a theatrical movie but then apparently they realized, hey,
5058160	5059160	you know what?
5059160	5060160	The movie really sucks.
5060160	5065000	So let's just release it straight to DVD, which means that someone dumped it to the
5065000	5066000	internet.
5066000	5068520	Doesn't the movie have Ally Larter in it?
5068520	5069520	Who is...
5069520	5070520	Devin Alki in it.
5070520	5071520	Yeah.
5071520	5075680	Ally Larter is the one chick on Heroes that nobody likes her storyline and everybody who
5075680	5077320	TiVo's it fast-forward her scenes.
5077320	5080120	Is she the one who plays the split personality?
5080120	5081120	Yes.
5081120	5083520	I haven't even watched any and I know who that is.
5083520	5085440	I think she's in the movie, right?
5085440	5088920	The only thing I saw was a scene of her in that place.
5088920	5090800	I, you know, I...
5090800	5091800	Spoilers!
5091800	5092800	I told Rob.
5092800	5093800	I know.
5093800	5098160	It is available on Google Video and to be honest, if you really want to watch the whole
5098160	5102600	thing I guess it's better than spending the money to rent it or buy it.
5102600	5109580	But really, I just hear it's just yet another really bad movie.
5109580	5111080	It won't play.
5111080	5114720	Well, I think they had originally it linked on.
5114720	5116520	Don't they keep taking it down and stuff?
5116520	5119120	It keeps getting taken down, but it is.
5119120	5124080	It does come back up and if you read the Kotaku story which links to the structural story.
5124080	5127380	It's like that Natalie Portman video when she rapped on SNL.
5127380	5132000	They just kept taking it off of YouTube and it kept coming right back.
5132000	5135900	But here's what you can do if you really want to, you know, watch it and keep it or whatever.
5135900	5141060	You can always download the PSP or iPod versions and you can download those straight to your
5141060	5142060	PC.
5142060	5146520	If you don't want to stream it later on.
5146520	5150080	Brad from Pod Culture which is another indie podcast is in our chat room right now and
5150080	5153560	says, LOL we just reviewed that on our latest episode.
5153560	5159340	So if you want to hear Brad's review of Dead or Alive the movie, check out podculture.blogspot.com.
5159340	5164520	This whole movie could have been made a lot better and worth watching if it were rated
5164520	5167640	NC-17 and there was more nudity.
5167640	5173520	Because right now as it stands there is no nudity in it so that is the main problem to
5173520	5176880	why this, because it doesn't matter if the movie sucked, as long as it had nudity it
5176880	5181240	would have been great.
5181240	5184000	Whoever is playing this rondo of blood is really bad.
5184000	5186640	I mean how about the, you know, how about the...
5186640	5190240	You know one of those sites taped me playing one of the game.
5190240	5191880	I don't know who did it, but you know how like they do the...
5191880	5193760	Did you keep getting picked up by the dragon?
5193760	5194760	No.
5194760	5195760	Then this isn't you.
5195760	5196760	Oh good.
5196760	5199880	Because you know like sometimes they hook up their equipment like as you're playing
5199880	5200880	it and they're taken.
5200880	5201880	Like that happened...
5201880	5205400	I know some of the Rumble Roses XX clips out there were mean because like I was sucked
5205400	5209440	so bad I was getting owned and like so there's some Rumble Roses XX clip out there and I'm
5209440	5211360	playing the chick who's getting killed really bad.
5211360	5212360	I'm sorry.
5212360	5213600	I'm sorry if I keep going back to...
5213600	5215880	I know, total tangent stuff.
5215880	5216880	Anyway.
5216880	5221840	We will beat the Dracula out of her during the break folks, so don't worry.
5221840	5224160	Oh, oh, oh.
5224160	5229080	There is a new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan this spring.
5229080	5234360	Sega and Toei Studios are teaming up for a feature-length adaptation.
5234360	5242240	It's Ryugo Goto-ku is the Yakuza name, part two is coming out.
5242240	5248680	It's coming out from Miike and he had practiced before making cinematic versions of the game,
5248680	5250560	so should be interesting.
5250560	5257120	He's also made Audition, Chakushin Ari, and one of Loki's favorites, Ichi the Killer.
5257120	5259320	Ichi the Killer is awesome.
5259320	5263160	He should be very excited about this new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan because if they
5263160	5266260	tear some guy's face off and throw it against a wall, I mean, I don't see how that could
5266260	5268600	be bad like in Ichi the Killer.
5268600	5269600	That was gross.
5269600	5271880	I still will not watch that.
5271880	5274260	You don't think they have a special edition of that out now, I think?
5274260	5275720	It's pretty violent.
5275720	5280720	If they have a super violent version of the movie, I would totally watch that.
5280720	5283000	I remember seeing it somewhere.
5283000	5288400	Well, at any rate, you know, there's I'm sure people who are going to be a little violent
5288400	5291780	over this bit of information.
5291780	5299520	A major UK retailer, HMV, their online store, is taking pre-orders for PlayStation 3s, but
5299520	5307480	you have to also purchase a 4GB PSP pack, so you'll be paying a total of £675.
5307480	5315720	They're sending an email out that will say you become one of the lucky few who can pick
5315720	5318080	up the PlayStation 3 at launch.
5318080	5324240	The quote says, at HMV.co.uk, we've been working with Sony to offer up to 5,000 customers an
5324240	5328200	incredible deal when you buy the new Sony 4GB PSP.
5328200	5332760	Sony takes advantage of this offer, will get priority over other HMV.co.uk customers for
5332760	5334240	the PlayStation 3.
5334240	5339400	The deal also includes two PSP games, Kills and Liberation and Gangs of London, for the
5339400	5344320	price of £674.99.
5344320	5348240	Are they expecting the same mass hysteria over there in the UK that they had over here
5348240	5352240	at first, which, you know, then after Christmas just kind of dropped off like a rock?
5352240	5355640	I mean, is that, because that's the kind of shit we saw them doing over here when it came
5355640	5356640	out.
5356640	5358840	It's crazy, and then realize the Wii was better.
5358840	5363640	Well, again, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, and, you know.
5363640	5364640	So the Wii is better.
5364640	5366840	Well, yeah, and the Wii had Zelda and all that.
5366840	5370560	There's one good PlayStation 3 game out right now.
5370560	5371560	One.
5371560	5373400	I really hope more comes out.
5373400	5378040	I mean, I, it's not that I want to see Sony fail, and it's not that I want to make fun
5378040	5383440	of Sony, and I love my PlayStation 2, but, God damn, Sony.
5383440	5384560	They're making it easy for us.
5384560	5388040	I know, it's like, God, argh!
5388040	5392360	We actually have not touched our PS3 in, I want to say, about two weeks now.
5392360	5396800	And the only reason we actually put anything in it was to watch Talladega Nights, and that
5396800	5400080	was Dan, and I left the room.
5400080	5402320	I'm sorry I grew up in Alabama.
5402320	5407120	Alpha Canagram says, I hadn't played Zelda in two to three weeks due to Virtual Console.
5407120	5409520	You know, I forgot to say at the top of the show I've been playing Virtual Console, that's
5409520	5410520	the other stuff I've been playing this week.
5410520	5413280	Mario Kart 64, awesome.
5413280	5414680	Still stuck on R-Type.
5414680	5417840	I've been playing Zelda, Link to the Past, as well.
5417840	5418840	R-Type.
5418840	5422040	Zelda, Link to the Past, Super Contra 3.
5422040	5425800	I can play that on my Nintendo.
5425800	5426800	R-Type.
5426800	5430760	My name's Jamie, and I have 50,000 consoles in my house.
5430760	5431920	They're all collecting dust, too.
5431920	5433240	We actually might sell some.
5433240	5434240	Really?
5434240	5435240	Yeah.
5435240	5436240	I'll have to find money.
5436240	5438440	I want a Virtual Boy, for no good reason.
5438440	5439440	Do you have a Virtual Boy?
5439440	5440440	You want to buy mine?
5440440	5441440	Five dollars.
5441440	5442440	Seriously?
5442440	5443440	Five dollars right now.
5443440	5444440	I don't know.
5444440	5448080	I'm going to get five dollars right fucking now.
5448080	5450040	I might have some change in my room.
5450040	5451040	Alright, anyhow.
5451040	5452040	I'll take it for six.
5452040	5453040	Ten?
5453040	5454040	Do I hear ten?
5454040	5455040	Fuck you, bitch.
5455040	5456040	I'll buy ten.
5456040	5457040	I put down ten.
5457040	5458040	Fifteen.
5458040	5459040	Do we hear fifteen?
5459040	5460040	Fuck that.
5460040	5461040	It's not worth fifteen dollars.
5461040	5462040	Yay!
5462040	5463040	Ten dollars!
5463040	5464040	Guess what?
5464040	5465040	I lied.
5465040	5466040	You're a bitch.
5466040	5467040	Alright, anyway.
5467040	5468040	You still love me.
5468040	5469040	Maybe.
5469040	5471640	While we all fight out how we're going to buy the console behind the scenes and play
