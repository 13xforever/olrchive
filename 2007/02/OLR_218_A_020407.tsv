13993	26004	Tonight, February 4th, 2007, first-hand accounts of the newest Konami games from their Gamers Day event, Denver Live goes straight from theaters to video to the internet, and did Windows Vista break your favorite PC games?
32065	36430	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36490	40174	This is episode number 218 for this February the 4th of 2007.
41856	47322	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47682	48062	Yo.
48343	49344	How you doing, Jamie Summers?
50245	50725	I'm doing.
51166	51426	Yeah?
51666	53088	Been an interesting week.
53353	54254	It's been an interesting week.
54274	55215	Yeah, I could say the same.
55315	56637	It's been a very interesting week.
56657	57578	We'll get into that in a minute.
58318	60080	Say hello as well, though, to Tech Master Loki.
60521	60701	Hello.
60741	61742	How are you doing, Loki?
62143	62883	I'm doing good.
62904	64205	Did you have an interesting week as well?
65967	66247	Yes.
66648	66928	All right.
67418	70779	Well, for those of you that are new to our program, we just want to say hello and welcome.
71059	76741	We were lucky enough to have a story of ours on the front page of Dig this week, so we're thinking we might have got a couple new people thanks to that.
77081	80462	So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lawn Radio, a big howdy hello to you.
80522	83903	Thank you for choosing to support independent podcasting, first off.
84283	90544	And just so you know, we're a show made up of three friends who have kind of become friends to each other just through doing this program.
91325	96186	We sit here and we talk about games every week, and the way that you would sit down and talk about
96553	97374	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
115544	117626	But sometimes we're not always going to break the news.
117646	119768	We're just going to talk about it and give you our viewpoints on it.
119788	121810	We're dedicated to giving every gamer a voice.
122250	124372	And we do that partially through our chat room as well.
124392	125413	A big hello to the chat room.
125754	131399	Joining us at chat.orangelandradio.com when we tape live here on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
131980	134782	Also we have our Skype line which we'll open up later in the program.
134842	137925	It's also an 800 number you can give us a call at and share your thoughts.
137945	138786	We'll open that up later.
139146	140628	So that way all you guys have a voice.
141348	147492	All right, and of course tonight they're talking a little bit in chat room about the Super Bowl, which is going on right now.
148733	155098	But I guess between the three of us, we kind of don't really keep tabs on what's going on in the Super Bowl.
155118	159481	But I will say the Puppy Bowl was awesome, and I'm kind of sad I missed the kitty halftime.
159921	161563	Puppy Bowl is kind of boring.
161823	164385	But the Puppy Bowl is cute because they have the bowl cam.
164405	165165	I like the bowl cam.
165265	165605	You know what?
165645	167507	They need like a Madden for puppies.
168616	169537	Thank you for watching!
187788	190450	I was thinking the puppy bowl would be something like that, and it wasn't.
190750	193211	It was cute, but it was just three hours of cuteness.
194552	208020	I was sitting in here working on some last minute things for the show, and I just hear out in the living room, DarkSakura, my roommate going, That was your roommate, that was not me.
208300	209041	No, it was you.
209261	210061	It was both of you.
213686	220970	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
221250	227673	I was on my ass in this chair playing Tech and Dark Resurrection on PSP.
228054	230795	And I'm going to get Dancing Blade because I played the old one and that was pretty cool.
232176	234337	I actually did not play any Cooking Mama this week.
235646	238328	Are you in a 12-step recovery program?
238368	243031	No, I'm in a, oh my god, my midterms are next week type of thing, so.
243531	245092	I've been studying muscle groups.
245552	249895	Which I guess if I went back and played some, you know, Trauma Center, I'd be okay for class.
251656	252076	Or something.
252196	259721	I loaned out my copy of Trauma Center to a friend of mine who just got a Wii, so I'm sorry to say I don't have my version for you to practice on.
259781	260561	But that's a fun game.
261702	262062	So fun.
262763	264664	I like the Trauma Center version.
265322	270227	You know, I've actually gotten pretty good at some of it, but it's still frustrating.
270267	272930	I was like, can't I just rub them until they're better?
274492	274812	So, yeah.
276234	277014	That's really been it, though.
277315	278756	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
279277	284282	I played more of the Crackdown demo, like another three or four times yesterday.
285343	285984	I love that game.
286344	287986	I just can't wait for the full thing to come out.
289465	297150	You know, it's one of those games that I was like, well, you know, because everyone was saying, oh, it's kind of the demo, they didn't like the demo or anything like that originally when I was first hearing about it.
297170	299812	I was kind of like, well, you know, I don't know if I'm going to like this.
300252	304375	I actually like it better because you can actually explore a lot more of the city.
304395	315122	And there's, you know, I did climb to the top of the tower in the middle of the city, which is fun, difficult, and a little bit, you know, a little bit of,
316525	317546	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
347293	355376	Pretty cool, kind of reminds me of NBA Jam a little bit because, you know, the players are doing stuff that you would normally not see anyone doing in basketball.
355836	357456	But it's pretty fun.
358217	360737	Not a game I'd be picking up, but, you know, definitely a fun game.
360817	365199	I really wish NBA Jam would just come back, you know, because NFL Blitz is kind of lame.
365299	368920	You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but NBA Jam was definitely one I could get into.
368980	370081	That game was a lot of fun.
370381	370901	It really was.
370921	374402	I still love the old NFL Blitz, but this Blitz League shit's retarded.
375064	377787	Some comments from chat room regarding your comments on Crackdown.
377807	381771	Jeremy Todd 1 says, The grenade launcher in the Crackdown demo is so freaking awesome.
381791	385515	You can literally just keep blowing everyone up with a single button push.
385635	388678	Flying, flaming people equals automatic 10 out of 10 score.
389459	391481	Mystic Gohan wants to know, how did you get up there?
391981	392622	How did I get up there?
393402	393763	Climbing.
395204	397727	Seriously, it's just climbing.
398407	398748	There's...
399366	403050	If you keep climbing up the side of the building, you'll eventually get to this part where it's kind of flat.
403510	407454	Then on one of the ends of the three towers, they have scaffolding.
407494	410496	And if you jump on the scaffolding, you can kind of make your way up a little bit more.
411557	420245	But you really need to have at least a third level on your jumpy and stuff in order to be able to reach some of that.
420906	422127	But you can get pretty high.
424868	425428	It's pretty fun.
426129	428150	It's even more amazing, too, when you get that high.
428430	430851	You can still see all the cars and people walking down below.
430891	435933	I mean, that's pretty amazing compared to Saints Row, which you wouldn't see any of that stuff.
435953	437293	Stuff would be glitching out and stuff.
437374	439614	But I can't wait.
440075	442356	I can't wait for Saints Row 2, whenever the hell that comes out.
443396	446057	But Crackdown, that's going to hold me over for a long time.
446738	447438	Hold you over to what?
447458	448258	Oh, Grand Theft Auto?
448278	449139	Is that what you're waiting for?
449159	450059	Oh, yeah, Grand Theft Auto 4.
450779	451199	Anything else?
452380	452420	Um...
453385	455967	No, actually, oh, I played Luminous a little bit.
456347	462532	I got some more achievements playing the time attack stuff, and I think that's all I played.
462592	463733	Yeah, that's it.
464193	464413	All right.
464854	471979	Well, my gaming week wasn't too thrilling because I'm still in my world of Warcrack mode, so I'm still playing there with the guilt.
472372	472893	OrangeLandsRadio.com
495126	496266	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
519572	528575	So there was a film on there that one of my friends had seen that said I'd probably like called Hard Candy, which I decided to download in HD just because I wanted to see how was the HD delivery and everything.
529156	532837	And, well, the movie itself was kind of weird.
532877	537219	I mean, I guess it was good for like the first 40 minutes and it was just like WTF and it was kind of gross.
537679	538259	But anyway...
538632	539973	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
564032	567634	Once you download the movie to your hard drive, you have 14 days to start watching it.
567994	571915	And then once you press the play button and start watching it, you have 24 hours to finish it.
572676	576457	Which, you know, if I'm going to sit down and watch a movie, that was certainly ample time for me to finish it.
576517	579058	But just so you know before you download any of that stuff.
579658	582460	Picture quality, because I downloaded in HD, was pretty good.
583480	588322	I don't know if HD gives me anything that much more than DVD does.
588362	589662	I mean, yeah, it's a little crisper.
589723	591203	Yeah, the colors stick out a little more.
591303	593164	But is it worth...
593766	595146	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
622269	625531	It wasn't having the slowdown problems that the store did when it first launched.
625571	631414	Whatever, I guess maybe the curiosity factor settled down a lot and things, it's easier to get in there and download movies now.
631494	638498	So I would recommend if there's a movie on there that interests you, you want to see how it looks, download one, try it for yourself, why not?
639386	655688	I also downloaded for free because it was for free for a couple days the first episode of the Sarah Silverman program which was hilarious but the audio is off a little bit because we also taped my roommate taped it on the DVR and then I was like oh we can download it it'll be like perfect quality and while the video quality was great the sound was off
656448	656928	Thanks for watching!
677436	681239	Going to the chat room and seeing what the folks are saying there in the chat room.
682099	682500	Let's see.
682960	685362	Blackboy says, God, Shelly Winter is in HD.
685442	687924	No, not the old-ass Poseidon Adventure.
687944	688645	I mean the new one.
688665	690106	What did the new one have in it?
690146	692508	It had... What was that guy?
692588	695090	It's in... God, I can't even remember his name.
695130	699794	Who's the guy that's Snake in Revenge of New York or whatever?
700375	701335	Oh, that's Kurt Russell.
701375	702036	Kurt Russell's in it.
702777	703337	That's what it is.
703717	705619	Mike W. says, Rob is a movie snob.
706257	707118	Yeah, maybe a little bit.
707238	707558	I don't know.
708538	711360	Mike W says, Rob only plays Xbox Live Arcade.
711680	713421	Yeah, lately that's what I've been playing.
713441	718064	There hasn't been a whole lot released on disc that I've wanted to play, but I enjoyed Heavy Weapon.
718084	718925	I love Luminous.
719605	721406	I love the Xbox Live Arcade games.
721426	724849	I like those little, I don't want to say throwaway games, but the little like...
725829	727090	Because I have gamer ADD.
727130	734136	If you've listened to this show long enough, you know that I never stick with one game for a long time, with the exception of the few MMOs I've played.
734176	737119	And even then, I quit and go back and quit and go back all the time.
737199	739481	So, Xbox Live Arcade games are perfect for me.
739561	743964	But I do want to check out Fusion Frenzy, which is kind of the same thing.
743984	748048	It's like 40 minigames in one, but it's an actual release game as opposed to Xbox Live Arcade.
748989	752672	And I'm definitely looking forward to some of the Xbox Live Arcade news we have coming later in the show.
753786	754787	and DarkSakura.com.
777449	783913	Sunday nights at 6 o'clock or our rebroadcast on All Games, which is currently Monday at 5.30 Pacific and 9 a.m.
784013	786495	on Tuesday Pacific time at AllGames.com.
786535	788976	Although I hear those times might be changing in the near future.
789957	791298	We'll let you know the details when that happens.
791398	792598	Also, we have a MySpace.
792839	804005	So if you have a MySpace, if you want to come join us where the Internet goes to die, MySpace, the antichrist of the Internet, it's MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
804025	804226	What?
805560	807101	We have another community.
807141	808702	Yes, we have our LiveJournal community.
809202	809722	And what else?
810262	810923	What am I forgetting?
811703	812003	DeviantArt?
812043	813024	Is there a DeviantArt community?
813444	814905	We have a few communities, thankfully.
815005	815945	We don't have a DeviantArt community.
815965	816666	There's Frapper.
816806	817446	There's the Frapper.
818326	820207	We have our forums, too.
820307	822028	Oh, I already plugged the forums.
822088	822829	Okay, fine.
822869	823829	Fine, then I'll plug them again.
823949	825410	OrangeSongsRadio.com Use them!
825450	826891	My God, people, it's not hard.
828892	829332	It's fun.
829992	831393	And we read them and respond a lot.
831433	833054	I have more posts on the forums than anybody.
833334	835295	Probably Loki and DarkSakura are up there, too.
836166	836507	Not me.
836947	837287	Not you?
837787	839888	Why aren't you participating in the forums, you hypocrite?
840209	841269	I'm not a hypocrite.
841329	842070	I'm babysitting.
842190	842650	Oh, I see.
843510	845031	All right, well, let's get into some gaming news.
845171	846212	And we're going to start it off.
847233	854256	As I mentioned at the top of the show, we were very lucky to have our coverage of Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party hit dig this week.
854296	856918	So thank you guys very much for giving us a dig on there.
857318	861280	And as we reported, we were lucky enough to attend Konami Gamers Day earlier this week.
861300	862221	And we'll tell you more about it.
862601	863322	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
889884	892747	I think a lot of people expected the DDR was going to come to the Wii.
892927	893808	It was just a matter of time.
894289	894969	I don't know about you.
895170	896651	I wasn't expecting to hear it this early.
897012	902758	Like, I kind of thought we would see it maybe... Like, doesn't it seem still early in the Wii's life for us to be getting this game?
903218	903558	I don't know.
903739	904019	Maybe.
904419	904660	Maybe.
904680	904720	So...
905482	906803	I was surprised at the timing of it.
906863	912127	I thought we wouldn't hear anything about it until at least E3, if not 2008, but it looks like we are getting it this year, at least according to the press release.
912147	914789	Well, probably because there's not going to be another PlayStation 2 version this year, I would think.
915229	915589	I don't know.
915950	919692	They didn't show one off, so that would imply that, but I don't know.
920473	928358	There's a lot of stuff they didn't show off at Konami Gamers Day, so they didn't say anything about Metal Gear Solid 4, except kind of cock-tease us with a release date and then not say anything.
928759	929839	That was stupid.
930740	931060	They knew.
931100	932041	It's coming soon.
932061	933442	I was like, that's such a rough thing.
933462	934943	They knew we all wanted to know it.
935575	936495	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
963922	967709	Because that might leave it to a much bigger announcement coming up later.
968570	972016	Ah, so you think Silent Hill 5 is worthy of a press conference all on its own.
972316	972577	Why not?
972981	973782	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
997950	998651	We'll see.
998811	999772	It was interesting, the little demo.
1024809	1026711	Now, of course, it's on the Wii.
1026851	1028952	You've got to wonder, how's the Wii Remote going to be used?
1029212	1030773	And yes, you use the Wii Remote in the game.
1031233	1038658	Basically, I think this is more of a concept build, what we were looking at at the show, because it basically looked like DDR Supernova, but blue.
1039038	1045342	And then every so often, an arrow would be replaced with this little icon that kind of looked like the Wii Remote and then unchecked next to each other.
1045362	1045802	It looked like a pause.
1045922	1048183	We're still really experimenting with what the Wii thing is going to do.
1067629	1070010	By the way, I want to mention something I didn't post anywhere on the site.
1070050	1073031	Since Jason Enos was there, I took an opportunity to ask him a couple questions.
1073431	1076513	And I asked him, I said, So how about DDR in the Arcade?
1076873	1078533	Anything you want to say about DDR in the Arcade?
1078553	1080134	And he, of course, didn't really have anything to say.
1080154	1085596	I said, What about that rumor there's an expansion coming to Supernova with, you know, the 2030, 203 or more songs?
1085636	1087537	He said he didn't know anything about it.
1088017	1089798	Which could be the polite way of saying no comment.
1089898	1090278	I don't know.
1090478	1095320	But rest assured, those rumors that you've seen floating around the other DDR sites...
1096178	1098600	Jason says you don't know about it, so that's what I'm going with.
1099221	1099761	I'll trust him.
1099981	1116176	What's interesting, though, is I was reading there are some rumored release dates, and I haven't heard anything about this yet, but that stupid Codemasters Dance Factory game was going to be coming to the Wii in March before DDR.
1116436	1116937	Oh, interesting.
1117177	1122202	But, I mean, I can tell you right now the game's going to be ass, just because the last one was ass.
1123166	1124627	Looking at some comments from chatroom.
1124987	1128109	Jeremy Todd 1 says, Silent Hill Origins is now the next Duke Nukem Forever.
1128209	1128729	God, I hope not.
1129369	1131070	Jaded says, Silent Hill, there won't be a 5.
1131370	1132631	I doubt that.
1132691	1134152	Those are big words.
1134172	1135432	4 sold pretty well, didn't it?
1135452	1136973	I don't see why there wouldn't be a 5.
1138294	1141916	Alright, Rama says, DDR Supernova 2, In The Groove, Dream On.
1142616	1142896	Dream On.
1142976	1143337	I'm sorry.
1143677	1145818	I've been following the Bomani scene for a long time.
1146917	1149658	In the Groove songs are not coming to DDR.
1149998	1157620	And I don't have any insider knowledge to back that up, granted, but just having followed Konami and the Bonnie series as long as I have, it's not happening.
1157840	1160240	Stop getting your hopes up about it, because you're going to be disappointed.
1160280	1161461	It's not happening.
1162841	1165162	Once that ruling passed, In the Groove was officially dead.
1165322	1169603	So anyway, away from that, back to DDR on the Wii, because that's what we really want to talk about.
1171219	1172800	What I thought was interesting is the selection screen.
1172820	1176041	You could use the Wii remote to point and click at songs you wanted to play.
1176361	1178121	And it had a cute little DDR arrow icon.
1178161	1178441	I don't know.
1178501	1180442	It's all temporary right now.
1180622	1181102	Yeah, I'm sure.
1181342	1181602	I'm sure.
1181923	1182723	What did you think, Loki?
1182743	1183903	Because you actually got to play it.
1183963	1185964	What did you think actually playing the game?
1186424	1188105	Did it feel right?
1188405	1189025	Was it weird?
1189885	1192386	It was like DDR hands and feet mode.
1192848	1194371	Thanks for watching!
1206604	1208245	You know, you supported the eye toy.
1208445	1210827	You don't need to have a hands and feet mode in that.
1211307	1216992	Although, the thing is, though, if they do something like this, they could do some really interesting stuff with it.
1217032	1220554	Like, instead of, you know, have a whole section of the song that's all done with your hands.
1220654	1221935	I mean, that might be kind of cool.
1221995	1226338	That's what Jason was kind of implying, that they might want to do things where you do different motions.
1226358	1228900	Like, he referenced Saturday Night Fever, like the disco pose.
1229180	1231802	Like, there might be a symbol that you have to do that kind of pose.
1231822	1233764	They could do, like, what was in...
1234685	1235446	Samba de Amigo
1243573	1245354	Right now, it's still way too early.
1245374	1245955	It is.
1245995	1249617	Other than we know that there's DDR with possible stuff.
1249958	1256262	I just want to say, though, when I played it, I thought it did feel like it played a lot like hands and feet mode because none of this extra stuff was in there.
1256502	1257903	But I felt it was a lot cleaner.
1258203	1261506	Because the problem I have with the iToy is the device just sucks.
1261946	1265208	If you're not in the exact right lighting, it doesn't work.
1265228	1266709	And that's not Konami's fault.
1266990	1268511	It's just the iToy sucks.
1268671	1270052	I'm sorry, I've not played one...
1270652	1273314	Good thing with the eye toy, not one.
1273994	1278097	And you have to have the exact right lighting to make it work, and it never is right on DDR.
1278197	1284921	I don't know if you have a house where you can get it to work every time, but the nice thing about playing this on the Wii was that it worked every time.
1285181	1292125	Like, you don't have to have the perfect white background in your house to get the Wiimote shaking to pick up.
1292465	1296828	So that's what I liked about it, and it didn't matter where my hands or feet were, I could kind of do it wherever.
1297268	1298269	So that was kind of fun.
1298289	1298489	Mm-hmm.
1298889	1304954	So I had fun with it, and it certainly posed a... I mean, I was struggling on medium-level difficulty songs.
1305314	1309558	So it certainly adds a whole new challenge to it, which I'm sure the purists will not be happy about, but...
1310837	1316959	I did find it interesting, though, that all the dance pads were just the GameCube dance pads.
1317099	1328263	I think, you know, in speculating that DDR was going to come out on the Wii, I wondered how they were going to do the wireless pad without lag, and it never occurred to me, duh, just use the GameCube pads, because there's GameCube controllers on the thing, and it looks like that's what they're doing.
1328283	1334085	Because that's what, in the trailer, you could see clearly that even the non-Mario pads they used in the trailer were just plug-in
1335364	1336505	Thank you for watching!
1351974	1358055	and they're going to have a mode in this where you actually talk to each other and you have to do the same pose at a certain part in the song.
1358075	1360216	They know they want that in one type of mode.
1360236	1365777	So you have to communicate with each other and say, okay, we're going to disco, we're going to disco, we're going to sprinkler, Roger Rabbit, I don't know, whatever.
1366077	1368398	So that's going to be interesting, I think, if nothing else.
1369038	1371239	Also free play mode and workout mode.
1371519	1375560	No sign of edit mode, but I don't see how you couldn't have a DDR right now without edit mode.
1375580	1378400	So I don't see why that wouldn't be coming for those that want to edit the Wii things into it.
1378420	1379520	Yeah, it's way early.
1379581	1381461	It's probably just a technical issue for right now.
1381921	1384603	So if you want to see more on it, we even have some pictures.
1384643	1388706	We took some pictures of the trailer, which hasn't come out anywhere else yet.
1388726	1390126	And there's a picture behind the scenes there.
1390146	1394789	You can see Jason demoing it for some girl from some unknown press site who's giggling over it.
1395270	1396290	You can see all that on our site.
1396731	1400873	And we have the only picture of the interface as it is now.
1400893	1401634	But that's going to change.
1401654	1402655	The interface is going to change.
1402695	1404296	That was obviously a temporary interface.
1404656	1407858	But that's all at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to see more information on that.
1408544	1411547	So Loki, what else did you see at Konami's Gamers Day that you enjoyed?
1411987	1415170	There's actually quite a few games there and I got to try a little bit of everything.
1415650	1424777	One of the first games I tried was Time Ace, which in the preview kind of reminded me of Time Pilot because you're playing in kind of different time periods and you're flying planes and stuff.
1424838	1425218	The game...
1426178	1429680	Itself actually reminded me, the graphics remind me of Prop Cycle.
1429860	1431420	I don't know if you remember that old arcade game.
1431480	1432981	I freaking love Prop Cycle.
1433321	1435362	That's like one of the most underrated arcade games ever.
1435782	1437363	It reminded me very much of that.
1438083	1439484	Weren't you big on Prop Cycle, Jamie?
1440284	1442365	I worked at an Amcor arcade when it came out.
1443025	1444146	Prop Cycle's a bomb, man.
1444166	1445346	You fanned yourself when you played it.
1445366	1446487	I played it for free so much.
1446507	1447467	I love Prop Cycle.
1447767	1448187	Anyway, sorry.
1448447	1454550	Anyways, but the game kind of reminds me of that, at least the level that they had you try out, where you're kind of playing this biplane thing.
1455495	1456156	Time Ace, Time Pilot,
1477771	1481974	I mean, both of them are bi-playing games where you're fighting in different time periods.
1482114	1483495	It seems logical to me.
1484136	1484436	Interesting.
1484476	1487318	I just, for some stupid reason, did not make that connection.
1488659	1488959	I don't know.
1488979	1491161	I just thought that's what they were doing.
1491962	1492642	I could be wrong.
1492682	1497246	They could just be coming up with something that's almost identical and has almost the same name.
1498266	1498567	Whatever.
1499447	1503270	Another game I did play, though, was Coded Arms Contagion for the PSP.
1503750	1506933	And I can tell you, having played the first one...
1507682	1509623	It's just not good at all.
1536141	1538662	That's really, unfortunately, a problem with the system.
1538742	1540622	But the game itself looks pretty good.
1541342	1542983	I mean, it's okay.
1543063	1544703	I just didn't have very much fun with it.
1545504	1547584	But what can you say, I guess?
1547724	1550965	If you're used to playing first-person shooters on the PSP, then great.
1551005	1551885	Maybe you want to check out.
1552485	1556607	Definitely a good thing that they didn't do the random levels like they did the first one.
1556627	1560308	I don't know, but it kind of reminds me of a Metroid Prime type game.
1560328	1561968	I don't know.
1562984	1565545	Dewey's Adventure, I know we saw the video of that.
1565805	1566365	It looked okay.
1566566	1569787	Kind of reminded me of Kirby a little bit, actually.
1569807	1571608	It reminded me of one of their own titles.
1571668	1574669	It reminded me of the Kororimpa.
1574809	1575609	I can't say that.
1575629	1576209	Kororimpa?
1576430	1577250	Kororimpa.
1577530	1578350	I can't say that word.
1578670	1579931	It reminded me of Kororimpa.
1580703	1581183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1603097	1604418	But he can't really do anything else.
1604798	1608519	It's very interesting the way you change the temperature and it's supposed to change the environments completely.
1609959	1616401	You can actually shake the controller certain ways to cause earthquakes or to cause wind and stuff like that.
1616441	1618742	So that's kind of unique for a platform game.
1619262	1626950	When they were about to announce Dewey's Adventure and they were showing the trailer and everything and they didn't tell us what the name of it was yet, didn't you think we were about to see Elebits 2?
1627510	1629372	Yes, because... I totally thought that's what was coming.
1629392	1632475	The cutscene for the artwork is exactly the same.
1632775	1633816	Exactly the same.
1633836	1634677	It's the same style.
1634697	1637820	They got the same people that did all the arts in Elebits to do this game.
1638301	1640683	It feels like it's in the same universe.
1640703	1643266	It even had glowing creatures that were small.
1643286	1643486	I'm like...
1644302	1646804	All they're doing is remaking Elebits all over again.
1666480	1667661	I give Konami props for original stuff.
1679936	1681477	with that and Elebits and everything.
1681517	1686759	I mean, how easy would it have been to just ported Castlevania to the Wii where you use the Wii as the whip?
1686819	1687899	Whoop-de-doo!
1688259	1691300	They're coming up instead with original things for the Wii, which I think is kind of cute.
1691481	1693701	But I want a Castlevania game where you use the Wii as the whip.
1693781	1694682	I know we all want that.
1694722	1695782	We don't need it right now.
1695842	1697623	We have this other Castlevania thing to look forward to.
1697643	1698463	We're going to talk about it in a minute.
1698483	1699524	We don't need another 3D Castlevania.
1699544	1700124	That's true.
1700224	1702205	Castlevania 64 still burns a little bit.
1702945	1705486	Hey, now, we have 3D Castlevanias that aren't that bad.
1706385	1707426	But they're not that good either.
1707726	1709967	Castlevania 64 made my soul cry.
1710168	1713150	Compared to Symphony of the Night, everything since looks like poop.
1713270	1713770	I'm sorry.
1714010	1717612	Compared to freaking Rondo of Blood, everything is poop.
1717672	1718813	We'll get there in a minute, sweetie.
1718833	1719754	We'll get there in a minute.
1719774	1724297	Symphony of the Night was great, but it wasn't a true Castlevania in my opinion.
1725244	1732267	It was like Metroid featuring the Castlevania characters.
1733047	1739069	I'm not saying it was a bad game, it's one of my favorites ever, but it was Metroid featuring Castlevania characters.
1739729	1743911	But it was like the best thing I've ever played, one of the best games I've ever played in my life.
1744431	1752434	And granted, I think the best video game ever made, I don't know how many times I've said this on the show, but I think the greatest video game of all time is Super Metroid.
1753159	1755462	and so of course I love Symphony of the Night.
1774813	1795645	and it was kind of cool definitely a lot of detail in there and it was kind of cool you can go around ripping heads off of little demons and throw them at them and stuff like that and the entire environment was pretty destructible so I think it definitely looks like a better game definitely a lot better than their last brawler that came out so it should be good
1796648	1797988	The other one, Wing Island.
1798229	1805771	Wing Island on the Wii actually could very well be, you know, a sister game to Pilotwings.
1805811	1809132	I mean, it pretty much is Pilotwings from what I've seen.
1809812	1814233	And also, once again, kind of the same art style as, you know, Prop Cycle.
1816033	1818394	Very simple graphics, but it's fun.
1818434	1825136	You play, you know, a squadron of biplanes and you do a bunch of different missions from fighting lost cows to delivering, you know,
1828328	1835433	I'm looking at chat trying to answer some questions.
1836273	1841957	Travis Donovan for Prez in 08 asks, How did Rob get an Elebit for his 360 gamer picture?
1842458	1848202	You're seeing a lot of people on Xbox do this now and it's all thanks to the Xbox webcam and the way I got an Elebit is that
1848522	1849543	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1869398	1874799	I had a Mario Kart as my background because you can import themes from pictures on your computer.
1874859	1879180	So, you know, you can do fun little customizable things with your 360 that kind of make you go, what?
1879480	1880260	I haven't bothered.
1880300	1882821	I just have Perfect Dark.
1883921	1884381	That's fine.
1884441	1890323	And the one that the public sees, I can't... Because, you know, you only see the camera pictures if you're on the friends list.
1890383	1891743	But what do I have?
1891803	1894043	I think I just have one of the Pac-Man ghosts or something.
1894103	1895284	I change it almost all the time.
1895324	1896164	I change it like every week.
1896924	1897184	Okay.
1897526	1898507	It's like my MySpace.
1898547	1900768	You've got to change it all the time to keep it current.
1900948	1901789	Rob, look.
1903670	1905311	Oh, you have Pac-Man background on your phone.
1905351	1906271	It was a downloadable thing.
1907052	1908372	Did you pay money for that?
1908593	1909933	Yeah, I was bored.
1910093	1910434	Loser.
1910634	1911814	When I'm bored, I buy stuff.
1912095	1913676	All right, like most women.
1914016	1914496	Hey!
1915317	1916177	Hey, hey, hey.
1916217	1917738	You're mad because it's true.
1917758	1919139	You stopped that right now.
1919199	1924382	Hey, hey, hey.
1924862	1926223	I just got a bottle thrown at me.
1927416	1930199	Rob, I have a heart.
1931340	1932721	It bleeds for you.
1945639	1948880	So, you know, it's going to be our first Castlevania game that we have on the PSP.
1949360	1953661	And what's interesting is that, you know, elements of it are new, but it's still kind of an old game.
1954221	1960983	Basically what the Dracula X Chronicles are is that you're going to have this old game, Rondo of Blood, which they said has never been in the U.S.
1961043	1961523	before.
1961904	1962824	Never!
1964131	1974958	It hasn't, but I can't stop thinking about Castlevania V. You know, even though that game was ass, I mean, really, that game was like the worst Castlevania game they ever made next to 64.
1975018	1982563	Well, yeah, but in Japan... Actually, I would rather play Castlevania 64 than Castlevania V. In Japan, by the way, it was released as Dracula XX.
1983283	1983423	Right.
1983683	1991586	Well, so, so, they kind of, but I mean, after you got past the first stage, a lot of it was different, so it wasn't really the same game, but in a way it was.
1991647	1992027	But anyway.
1992047	1992847	I'm watching the trailer.
1993027	1995808	That's as much as we got of Rondo of Blood previously.
1996088	1999990	Well, now we are going to get not only the classic Rondo of Blood game on the PSP.
2000310	2001191	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2017944	2018664	Yes, I think so.
2018744	2018945	I think.
2018965	2019485	That's hot.
2019565	2019885	I think.
2020485	2021606	It was hard to hear sound in there.
2021646	2025628	Well, you remember, though, the show where I brought in my Turbo Duo.
2025648	2026648	That was before we were podcasting.
2026668	2028089	And hope you got to play it on air.
2028189	2029150	That was in like 2003 or 2004.
2029310	2030690	Yeah, that was a few years ago.
2030910	2031871	Yeah, I remember that.
2032811	2033492	I'll bring it back one day.
2034817	2036398	But yeah, it was a sexy game.
2036458	2037199	It looks great.
2037559	2041541	I love, love, love the 2D with the 3D look.
2041581	2045203	I mean, the best thing I could compare it to is like if you played Super Smash Bros.
2045263	2052527	Melee and you've played that mode where you like actually are in the Mario game, but it's like all 3D-ified even though it's 2D.
2052607	2055048	That's what they did to Rondo of Blood in this enhanced mode.
2055148	2055408	It's great.
2055448	2056169	Okay, Instant...
2057389	2058890	Impressed Points for me.
2060511	2062833	The game mechanics are the same as 2D.
2062933	2064354	Yeah, you can do the backflip.
2064414	2066736	Not just that, I was checking the timing of the moves.
2067076	2068977	They're exactly the same as the PC Engine.
2069037	2075422	It did play a little weird from the Castlevania games I'm used to, but I understand that's because the controls handled a little different back then.
2076142	2080905	Also, something you have to remember, since this was before Symphony of the Night, you cannot just go anywhere you want.
2081245	2082686	It's a little more like Castlevania 3.
2082726	2083507	It's a real Castlevania.
2083667	2084768	Castelvania 3 Castelvania 3
2104009	2113536	and a lot of people who were wondering who Maria was, who didn't know any better, she was actually playable in Rondo of Blood if you rescued her.
2114096	2117559	And all of her attacks were kind of stupid and cutesy little girly attacks.
2118279	2123543	But they were also based after the four gods of Chinese mythology, which I thought was pretty funny.
2123723	2126805	Oh, they redid the graphics for the Uber attacks in this game too.
2126845	2128406	Oh yeah, it's nice.
2128686	2132169	If you play the Saturn version though, she has those same attacks.
2132782	2133363	DRACULA X CHRONICLES
2146536	2149737	But they tease the idea that they might add new areas.
2149877	2152017	They're thinking about going back and retooling that game.
2152317	2155438	And I'm theorizing, why not give us the Saturn version?
2155598	2160760	I mean, I realize, you know, you can't really port the Saturn, but give us what the Saturn version had with Maria and that whole scenario.
2160800	2161760	That would be awesome.
2161960	2163180	Or the extra familiars.
2164160	2166341	For America, it would be...
2168685	2172247	It would be, you know, an addition because, of course, we didn't get the Saturn version.
2172587	2174568	And as for the extra familiars, they were useless.
2174788	2177549	They took them out for a reason, and I'm pretty glad that they did because they were stupid.
2178310	2181311	All it was was another one of the same thing that you already had.
2181991	2183612	Dude, the item crash is hot.
2183892	2187214	RavensDolphin says, I thought DarkSakura would be more excited about this.
2187694	2194497	Okay, when she first found out, I think I had to hold the phone about 10 inches away from my ear because I was going deaf.
2194837	2196338	I was going deaf from the squeaking.
2197320	2198901	I got my copy while we were doing the show, remember?
2198921	2201522	Because I had gone to Anime Expo and, to put a long story short
2222098	2227835	My friend Krista owed us money for our hotel room so she came back from Japan with a copy of Dracula X for me and called it even.
2229201	2230382	She owed us about $120 and gave us the game.
2259581	2262322	All the honeycombs around the one that you hit.
2262722	2264543	And so that's kind of like how the puzzle works.
2264563	2266143	You're trying to make lines of solid colors.
2266503	2270105	So it's one of those easy concept, but repeat playability.
2270465	2274626	Unfortunately, there was no sound, so it was hard for me to judge, does it have good music?
2274666	2276307	I mean, is this game called Honeycomb Beat?
2276747	2278807	But it doesn't really look like the music plays into it at all.
2278847	2282169	I think beat is just what they call tapping the screen to flip all the things over.
2282529	2286390	But I think if the price is right on this game, it could be a really good value buy.
2286830	2288291	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2317447	2327115	All the actions on the top screen, but when you pause the game or you tap things on the bottom screen, not only does the bottom screen show you the old arcade how to play banners, which I think is great.
2327495	2332319	Those old things you used to see, like when you press the button, your thing will fly or whatever it is.
2332479	2341046	You can also flip the top screen so that you can play in brain training style mode, where you're holding the DS vertically.
2341406	2348811	So for a more vertically oriented game like Puyen, it works great, because you don't really stretch the screen like you do if you're trying to squish it into the more horizontal.
2349091	2350812	So I thought that was a really smart idea.
2350912	2360859	So that's going to be a pretty good value, although granted, if you're an Xbox 360 owner, a lot of these games you've seen on live, or probably will be seeing on live a little later.
2361199	2364141	So a lot of those same games, but you get them on the go on the DS.
2366351	2368352	The next one I played is the game I can't pronounce.
2368472	2370574	Kororinpa.
2370754	2371934	Goddammit, Kororinpa.
2372234	2372895	Kororinpa.
2372995	2374316	Kororinpa.
2374376	2375757	Kororinpa.
2375837	2377618	Marble Mania on the Nintendo Wii.
2377918	2380920	Okay, you remember those old things they had back when we were kids?
2381040	2388764	Like those little marble mazes where you would turn the knobs left and right to move the marble around, but you didn't want them to fall in the holes like you tried to get it all the way to the end?
2389325	2390045	That's this game.
2391506	2394628	You tilt the Wii remote to tilt the grid around.
2395029	2401073	And so you could say in that sense, it's kind of like Marble Blast Ultra because there's, you know, like things that get in the way.
2401134	2407399	Like one round that we played had these giant scissors that closed on the course and you didn't want your ball to be in there.
2407639	2410781	And by the way, your ball could be all the, it could either be a little steel ball.
2411002	2413824	You could be like a soccer ball, a basketball or a little penguin ball.
2413864	2415085	Of course, that's the one I had to play with.
2415771	2416671	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2445760	2452614	so that was that game and then Brooktown High was the last thing I played on the PSP and uh
2454005	2456507	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2478288	2479688	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2506567	2507508	Thanks for watching!
2516758	2518059	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2540293	2542595	They had booth babes there promoting Brooktown.
2542635	2546658	It was really the only thing they kind of went out and did all these little cheers.
2547338	2551301	They really went all out for promoting that particular game at the show, which I thought was interesting.
2552282	2552943	Yes, DarkSakura?
2552983	2555405	I'm totally cosplaying Annette's outfit.
2556225	2557386	What, from Castlevania?
2557666	2558047	Yeah.
2559027	2560869	Thank you for having nothing to do with what I just said.
2560889	2561649	No, I'm sorry.
2561709	2565172	I was still looking at... They had some of the promo art up on GameSpy.
2565272	2566653	Oh, that's fine.
2566673	2569095	I played the Brooktown a little bit.
2570081	2575886	and, you know, the only thing that's disappointing is having played all the hentai, you know, dating sims out there.
2578387	2581850	It just, I did like, and I hope... What, you wanted to see 16-year-old Titty?
2581890	2582410	That's gross.
2582611	2596281	No, no, I hope, I hope it had in the game, because they, did you notice in the trailer, they had kind of, you know, all the, you know, symbols for sex, you know, in there, like the rocket taking off and like the, you know, the...
2597609	2600151	Oh yeah, the trailer!
2600191	2612980	They did this weird-ass thing in the trailer where suddenly pictures of the game were replaced with these real-life imageries of a flower blooming and a rocket taking off and all this crazy stuff.
2613000	2617383	I hope that, like, you know, if you go in for a hot coffee or something like that, you know, that...
2618117	2621158	This is gonna be really random, but did you see the new Psycho?
2621478	2623779	Like, remember when Gus Van Sant remade Psycho?
2624199	2626680	Like, in 1998 or something, he remade Psycho?
2627521	2634343	One of the things he did is he, like, in the death scenes, he added these random-ass clips that had nothing to do with it.
2634623	2642426	Like, when one person's getting stabbed, like, you see a train going through a tunnel, and, like, the clouds moving by in the sky, and it's, like, all this random shit.
2642687	2643947	That's what that reminded me of.
2644927	2645968	I mean, seriously.
2647881	2649022	Anyway, that was Brooktown.
2653584	2656925	Is chatroom giving you a hard time for being stuck on a Castlevania, DarkSakura?
2657466	2657826	I don't care.
2659266	2661568	All right.
2661808	2666550	I did want to mention, though, Korinpa and Wing Island are both going to retail for $40 instead of $50.
2667410	2668351	Oh, cool.
2668371	2669751	You picked that up through your distribution thing?
2669771	2670992	Because they didn't say that at the show.
2671152	2672113	Yeah, I picked it up.
2672693	2674714	I think I mentioned it maybe last week.
2674734	2675114	You might have.
2675134	2675694	Whatever, but...
2678817	2682621	Other games at the show that they had, Death Junior Science Fair of Doom on the DS.
2682942	2683883	I didn't see it there.
2684163	2686585	It was playable, it's just not a lot of people were playing it.
2686626	2687707	Sorry, Death Junior fans.
2688227	2691371	Go Pets on the Nintendo DS, which just interfaces with the PC.
2691451	2693913	It's a DS and PC game, which I thought was interesting.
2694554	2697017	It looked to me like a cross between Animal Crossing and Nintendogs.
2697477	2698638	Jamie, you'd probably love this game.
2699079	2700400	Maybe.
2700821	2701041	Maybe.
2701542	2702403	I might love this game.
2702983	2703924	It looked interesting.
2704004	2706967	The graphics looked a little rough, but it might have just been early stages.
2707007	2708829	They didn't have it playable, just the preview.
2710170	2710531	Let's see.
2710611	2711872	You talked about Hellboy already, right?
2712052	2712913	Yeah.
2713193	2714094	Lost in Blue 2?
2714614	2715475	I didn't like the first one.
2715515	2716456	I didn't care about the second one.
2716676	2717217	Sorry.
2717237	2721001	I played some of the minigames, like the goat milking and the... No.
2721981	2725465	It looks literally exactly like the first one.
2726641	2730444	Lunar Nights, which we told you about at F1 with Konami BBQ.
2730544	2731445	It looks pretty cool still.
2731825	2737750	And Winning 11 Pro Evo Soccer 2007 looked awesome on the 360.
2739371	2740793	Even on the PS2 it looks good.
2741093	2745316	It looks awesome, but to be honest, I couldn't get too excited about it because it's coming out next week.
2745556	2750300	I'm like, why even waste the space with this game?
2750340	2751341	I mean, it's coming out
2752213	2753453	Next week, I mean, who cares?
2773410	2774731	Make more console games!
2799946	2801587	Stop with all the portable games!
2821772	2823273	They had two last year.
2823353	2831856	I mean, they had, you know, Rumble Roses, XX, Woo Goody, and then the follow-up smash hit, Bomberman.
2832316	2834937	You know, two really awesome games for the 360.
2835977	2840739	And then, well, this year they've got Hellboy, which Hellboy looks good.
2840879	2841739	You know, I'll give them that.
2842380	2843580	And DDR Universe.
2843700	2846101	But put some more games on the 360.
2846161	2848842	Oh, and I guess, you know, winning 11 soccer, you know.
2849392	2851034	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2868152	2874835	I mean, oh goody, so we're going to see Karaoke Revolution, whatever the next one is, on 360 come fall.
2875455	2880417	SSJ100Matt says, Kojima probably wants to take his time with Metal Gear Solid 4 since it's his last one.
2880717	2882237	Yeah, he says that every time, dude.
2882377	2883538	He says that every time.
2884238	2885979	Bullshiz is his last one.
2886699	2887699	There's money to be made.
2887739	2888320	He'll come back.
2888840	2894882	Jamie, I know unfortunately you didn't get to go because of school, but what do you think from the perspective of getting to read all about this?
2895562	2897183	Are you excited about all this, or
2897918	2899098	Beyond just Castlevania?
2899518	2905700	Dracula X. I really don't care about anything but Dracula X. Really.
2905800	2906620	Nothing in the world.
2907460	2913182	No Super Bowl, no Kororimpa.
2913222	2923304	Okay, that one sounds interesting, but I really, my excitement over Dracula X is like phenomenal, monumental, bigger than a mole.
2923824	2924505	You know the creator.
2924545	2926205	In the terms of, you know.
2927807	2929933	The creator of Castlevania was there.
2930956	2933102	He is still a fucking rock star.
2933303	2934687	He came out and said, I got a new hat.
2935852	2938213	I have a picture of him, remember?
2938513	2938753	He's cool.
2938773	2939113	Yeah, I know.
2939153	2940413	We ran into him at E3, I remember that.
2940673	2942334	I know, I have all the celebrity run-ins.
2942354	2946715	I want to mention some things that kind of slipped under that most people didn't talk about.
2947415	2951676	There were some of the new lineups that they said for their plug-and-play stuff.
2952336	2960518	One of them, which was really big and I'm surprised I didn't pick, Music Mania, which I don't know if it's like Beat Mania or Poppin' Music or something, but they have a 3 and 5 key mode.
2961818	2962979	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2984768	2986629	and also, you know, DDR.
2986689	3002613	There was a study going on by the, uh, West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency where they had, um, it was a 24 week at home clinical study where they had, um, people play, uh, DDR five days a week for at least 30 minutes and, uh, record their activity.
3002953	3003873	They had to help monitors.
3003893	3013196	They were tracking weight, blood pressure, arterial function, fitness level, uh, BMI, um, and general, uh, attitude toward exercise and, um,
3014036	3020759	These studies came by, and see, all their subjects, by the way, were above the 85th percentile for body mass index.
3023220	3030202	Not all of them lost weight, but almost all of them were showing improved arterial function.
3030222	3034104	They were showing general levels of well-being improved.
3035164	3036605	The biggest thing on here, I thought, was...
3037546	3041749	Confidence and self-esteem improved.
3041789	3048793	They were more willing to participate in activity because they were so active and had more faith in their bodies and their capabilities.
3060854	3064463	Well, I think that it's... I mean, we know exercise is healthy.
3065125	3068192	But I think that taking something that makes it really...
3069136	3076179	Fun, because in the average person's mind, I think, they're not going to see, oh, I'm exercising.
3076419	3082261	Yeah, you don't have that whole, like, I can tell you from personal experience, I get weirded out with the idea of going to the gym.
3082301	3089965	There's something about that whole public sweating thing and the whole, you know, just like, and the whole, like, your bodybuilders, there's all those muscular people and everything.
3090185	3094126	There's kind of that big fear that kind of goes with the gym and intimidation that comes with that.
3094627	3098208	And you don't have that when you're playing DDR, because it's like, I'm just playing a video game.
3098567	3099187	I haven't kicked out.
3099207	3099587	I'm just Parapara.
3122091	3123372	Oh yeah, that was a good one too.
3123492	3132799	Well, I think the par par was more of a good aerobic workout than just DDRs because moving your arms with it, it's a lot more... Well, maybe that's what they hope to accomplish with this week.
3133300	3136582	At any rate, there's a little bit more to this that I think is cool.
3137363	3139845	The office of a West Virginia governor...
3141406	3160966	Actually, it looks like there's an association with the Department of Education and a few other facilities, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield, are giving financial support to eventually lead this into DDR games, training PE teachers, and promoting DDR clubs in West Virginia public schools.
3162389	3164070	and Konami gets all the profits.
3164350	3169071	But that's okay because it keeps new DDR games coming out at home and as long as they stay innovative, hey, they're fine by me.
3169251	3172873	I just laugh for all those people who say, oh, DDR won't work in America.
3174313	3177494	I bet you feel so stupid now.
3178515	3179055	Well, you know what?
3179075	3182336	This news is so huge that they even covered it on the national news.
3182376	3182896	Did you hear that?
3183936	3184357	Really?
3184437	3185217	Yes, I have a clip.
3185237	3185497	Hold on.
3187815	3197802	Researchers in West Virginia announced Friday the results of a study that suggests playing the video game Dance Dance Revolution improves the health of overweight kids.
3198483	3201985	Though not as much as its rival game, Hamburger on a String.
3205388	3207689	Okay, obviously that was from Saturday Night Live.
3207789	3212513	It's still kind of funny nonetheless to see a little DDR joke make its way into Weekend Update there.
3212793	3213573	I like Hamburger on a String.
3213593	3214194	And who doesn't love...
3214795	3216676	I miss Kevin Nealon doing the weekend update.
3216696	3218857	Yeah, but I love that Amy Pollard.
3218877	3219457	I love her.
3219517	3219937	She's fine.
3219997	3222978	Not as good as Tina Fey, but I love... She was with Upright Citizens Brigade.
3223198	3223899	Anyway.
3223939	3224799	Hamburger on a string.
3225639	3226640	And Miss Chevy Chase, too.
3227140	3233763	So, you know, we all know that the PlayStation 3 resembles a George Foreman grill or a grill of some sort.
3234103	3237264	In fact, people have gone as far as making it into an actual grill.
3237744	3243427	Well, now there's this one retailer in Akihabara that's...
3244466	3249889	Selling some unofficial 6-axis soy sauce to go with the PlayStation 3 grill.
3250189	3251030	That's kind of a joke.
3251610	3255992	They've basically rebranded some of the Bulldog brand soy sauce.
3258499	3260379	Yeah, it's actually quite funny.
3260580	3265021	They feature it in the smaller 20GB size or the larger 60GB size.
3266301	3268161	Is it 599 US dollars?
3268561	3269822	599 US dollars?
3270082	3271602	Is it made from giant enemy crabs?
3271882	3273843	No, in fact... Oh, these jokes will never get old!
3274223	3284265	It's actually, it says, it's being sold at Segatsu Isagi, and it's being retailed for 399 yen, marked down from 499 yen, and 599 yen for the larger one.
3288662	3300327	and it's kind of funny though because it has a picture of Ken Kutaragi on the front there and it also has a picture of PlayStation 3 with the top lifted up with a grill on it.
3300587	3308150	To be honest, I think that would be pretty cool if there was a grill on it because then you could eat and watch a Blu-ray movie at the same time.
3310111	3315693	If anyone doesn't know, Akihabara is the technical district, I guess.
3317931	3320752	You can buy all of your techie goods and now barbecue sauce.
3322093	3325274	I really want to buy barbecue sauce when I go buy a stereo.
3325354	3330516	DJ Janai says, Six Axis equals most innovative controller ever.
3331077	3332157	PS3 is the best.
3333078	3333518	Glad to know.
3333758	3339280	Glad to know we have some Sony fans in chat because, you know, sometimes it feels like there are no Sony fans left in the world.
3339360	3341621	So I'm glad to see somebody is still standing behind him.
3343122	3343242	So.
3343795	3346458	Anyhow, certainly these guys are fans of Sony.
3346498	3348801	They just express their fanboyism in a different way.
3349582	3351705	Because it's, let's see, who did this?
3352305	3357892	On the first day that firmware 3.10 came out, it got cracked.
3360435	3361075	That's kind of funny.
3361415	3372899	This was cracked by Team C plus D. And basically what happened is that, of course, they released the new firmware just a few days ago, and it got cracked right in the same day by this team who works hard to crack the games.
3373179	3378461	I'm sorry, to crack the firmware so that you can still continue to play your old school Nintendo games on your PSP.
3378521	3381582	And they've already come out with a custom firmware for 3.1.
3381622	3382763	What was it?
3382783	3383203	Yeah.
3383223	3383503	So...
3387624	3395387	Great, now you can actually install the custom firmware, play all your updated games, and still be able to play your wonderful NES ROMs.
3397087	3402029	DJ Janai says, continuous Sony fanboyism saying, come on, Sony does what Nintendo don't.
3402749	3407190	TheRobD counters with, everyone stands behind Sony to laugh at them behind their back.
3408891	3412212	Ranma says, I'll wait for the PS3 to be redesigned and retailed for $149.
3412512	3413352	Give it six more months.
3413992	3414172	Ouch.
3416153	3416433	All right.
3418106	3419687	Any more PlayStation stories?
3421608	3424249	I suppose I have some information.
3424389	3424649	Okay.
3425250	3425630	Some.
3426890	3433934	Well, there's a little game that spawned a very interesting little music video called Saints Row.
3436015	3439377	It's been confirmed that it will be going on to PS3.
3441098	3445240	It's staying sometime this spring and it will have a PlayStation Network support.
3446020	3448641	And so that means multiplayer online.
3450162	3454683	There was no mention, however, if they're going to have any additional content.
3456744	3461766	Speaking of Saints Row and that game had some CD parts in it.
3462126	3467248	Well, if you happen to be in some of the CD parts of Japan, you too can play the PlayStation 3.
3468075	3470756	And one of Japan's love hotels.
3471376	3474597	And yes, that is one of those brothel hotels.
3474917	3481138	Casa de Dew in Shibuya, Tokyo.
3482118	3489000	They have, with, I guess, your stay at these love hotels, you can be able to play PlayStation 3 for free.
3490566	3491486	So I guess that's great.
3491606	3499809	But at the same time, you know, I would be thinking, if you're staying at a love hotel, wouldn't you be going there for sex and not to play the PlayStation 3?
3500469	3504630	Or is Sony trying to tell me the PlayStation 3 is better than sex?
3505351	3513373	Or is it one of those things where it's like, okay, I'm going here and not only will I get a hot chick to sleep with me, or borderline hot chick to sleep with me, but she'll play games with me.
3513993	3516014	Well, love hotels aren't really just that.
3516114	3519155	They're also where people meet for rendezvous with their
3520427	3521188	Significant other.
3521828	3529453	And then all she would have to do is bake me a pie, and it's like the full thing.
3529913	3531654	I just wanted to get the death glare from Jamie.
3531894	3533215	I thought that was interesting, though.
3533935	3540620	I mean, I guess that's pretty cool, because after you've done it, then you can play video games.
3541260	3542761	It's just like you never left home.
3544140	3546962	Going back to a previous story in chat, reading some comments here.
3547022	3550483	Mike W says, it was decrypted day one, talking about the firmware.
3551284	3552084	Then it was cracked.
3552344	3553425	Fault story, whatever.
3553485	3554765	I don't care if OLR gets it wrong.
3554805	3555305	Well, you know.
3558447	3567771	Regardless, having the firmware get fucked with on day one, having some form of success with it, whether it be decryption or whatever it is, has got to say something.
3568572	3569992	It didn't take them long to make a custom.
3570012	3571533	It didn't take much longer after that anyway.
3572486	3572866	Let's see.
3573126	3576327	Ranma is bold and says, PlayStation 3 equals Sony's final console.
3577527	3581608	TheRobD says, What would you listen to in a love hotel while playing video games?
3581668	3584808	The I Want You to Watch Me Play Madden skit from MadTV.
3584828	3587589	I don't know if you've ever seen that, but it's kind of funny.
3590209	3593530	RavensDolphin says, Loki is going there with Nelly to a love hotel.
3594730	3596090	No, I wouldn't be going there.
3597690	3600171	Why would I travel all the way to Japan to go to a love hotel?
3600571	3601271	That's ridiculous.
3601892	3603673	Freedom of Speech
3627785	3634750	So, of course, what they were trying to do is, you know, try to change it to say that Utah was going to be basically had to be sold just like pornography does.
3635971	3636351	Let's see.
3636752	3638593	Republican Kay McCliff had this to say.
3639013	3647279	I am concerned when all the legal experts, including our own attorney general, as well as the sponsor, tell us that the bill is likely to fail in a constitutional challenge.
3647779	3653844	One where we cannot control the amount we spend because we spend our side and then we are potentially obliged to spend the legal costs of the other side.
3654704	3658326	Kay is trying to draft a substitute bill to replace the original.
3659266	3660187	Leave it to a Republican.
3660867	3667310	Well, you know, I don't want to turn this into a political war, but it's just general ignorance, I think, about the gaming community from everyone.
3667650	3671312	And I think a lot of folks could stand to be educated, no matter who you are or how you vote.
3672212	3673333	But mostly Republicans.
3673893	3675374	I think a lot of people just don't get it.
3675874	3677975	I'm just giving y'all a hard time.
3678215	3678595	All right.
3679355	3680596	Well, but there is... I have some...
3681778	3685939	I do have some news about someone who has his head up his ass that makes me happy.
3686499	3688399	Speaking of, you know, Republicans.
3689240	3691540	Sorry, I won't go off on Republicans anymore.
3691560	3699662	Okay, sorry, there was some debate going on.
3700122	3700862	Can we start over, please?
3701682	3701902	Yes.
3702423	3704343	Okay, thank you.
3705963	3708804	Speaking of someone who has his head up his ass...
3710108	3731236	he who shall not be named except right now Jack Thompson has been called on yet another complaint with the Florida Bar it's oh my god anyway there's a pending judicial review for five counts of professional misconduct against dumbass
3732594	3735057	I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be impersonal, right?
3735457	3743307	Against who shall not be named to be... Actually, he's supposed to be going to the State Supreme Court for action.
3743327	3744989	I think that's pretty cool.
3745089	3746350	But the quote on here...
3748390	3757855	In the suit, he who shall not be named represented the families of two Fayette, Alabama police officers and a police dispatcher murdered by an 18-year-old grand theft auto player in 2003.
3758176	3764079	At the time of his arrest for the killings, Devin Moore reportedly said, life is like a video game, you have to die sometime.
3764799	3767841	Moore subsequently convicted of the murders now sits on Alabama's death row.
3768161	3771923	He who shall not be named was not involved in the criminal case against Moore.
3772463	3772723	Yeah.
3776337	3784181	Honestly, the other two complaints actually have to do with the attacks he made on Shock Radio in South Florida.
3785081	3789183	And, you know, I'm just so disgusted.
3789964	3793726	Really, I hope that he is disbarred.
3793866	3794926	I hope this is the end of it.
3796707	3799909	That would be awesome if we never had to report on him again.
3800009	3801129	That would be the best thing ever.
3802050	3802710	I'd hold a party.
3803206	3805648	Uh, Ranma and Sha- I think- I think we would- You know what?
3805988	3807970	If this happens, we should throw a party.
3808230	3809531	We absolutely should throw a party.
3809571	3817417	We have a special party edition of Orange Lounge Radio, um, celebrating the vanquishment of he who shall not be named.
3817458	3818518	We'll get guests and everything.
3818558	3822421	I bet you anything, cause you know Gamer Andy was a big part of that flower, and he doesn't live that far away.
3822461	3824123	I bet you we could get him here to join our party.
3824143	3824323	We should
3825063	3828904	We'll hold a big, massive freaking party.
3828944	3831825	We'll play Mortal Kombat Armageddon with custom characters.
3832765	3836246	We'll play nothing but video games where we put Jack Thompson in them.
3836446	3838546	What about the Combine game?
3839026	3840086	Sure, we'll play that too.
3840227	3840667	Why not?
3840707	3841807	We'll play that too.
3842647	3843587	That'll piss them off.
3843767	3846588	And our Music of Choice is 2 Live Crew and Ice-T.
3847358	3848018	Bring it on!
3848058	3848859	I love this idea!
3848899	3849359	You know what?
3849479	3851120	I think we should have this party anyway.
3851941	3856123	No, but we're, okay, the party only happens if he gets disbarred.
3856603	3858004	Okay, is that the criteria?
3858244	3863527	If he gets disbarred in the state of Florida, OLR, he lost his license party.
3864728	3866489	He who shall not be named is vanquished.
3866889	3872252	However, if he is not disbarred, we send him a bag of poo in the mail.
3873175	3873796	Jack Voldemort
3896667	3897608	I love that idea.
3898068	3899589	He is just he who shall not be named.
3899609	3902131	From here on out, we are calling him Jack Voldemort.
3902372	3903052	I love that idea.
3903232	3916323	And by the way, the reason why I brought up Two Life Crew and Ice-T is that he was also instrumental in the whole cop killer scandal for Ice-T and for Two Life Crew's as nasty as they want to be.
3916623	3918604	And we'll also listen to Howard Stern.
3918845	3919185	Yes.
3920186	3922227	We should copy it and send it to Howard Stern.
3922247	3923108	Maybe not.
3925120	3926942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3956004	3958706	That's right, it's our chance to rant about whatever we want.
3958726	3960007	It's the FUs of the week.
3960147	3961748	Get it out of your system, DarkSakura.
3961848	3962449	I have two.
3963249	3965351	The first one, FU to my uterus.
3966772	3973136	Next one is an FU to Roseville, Mitsubishi, you bastards!
3974597	3976138	Okay, this is what happens.
3977499	3979080	My husband has a 2006...
3984767	3989208	Lancer, um, Ralliard, sorry.
3989508	3991869	So it's like a model under the evolution.
3991929	3993789	It's a nice, nice car.
3994809	4000931	And he uses it to go to work, and he uses it, you know, sometimes for a couple of Bay Area trips.
4000971	4003051	He doesn't drive it really crazily.
4003371	4007792	I drive more violently than he does, and my car's still in good shape.
4008692	4011373	Well, um, the transmission balloons.
4012422	4020745	and he hadn't been, you know, in a car with only 15,000 miles on it that he's only had for a year, there's no reason for a transmission to go out that quickly.
4021165	4024486	So he took it to Roosevelt Mitsubishi.
4025126	4030188	And Bob Coffey, what I was saying is that it's the step under the Evo.
4030268	4031348	Listen to what I said.
4031448	4031888	Hi.
4033569	4035390	And the FU to my uterus is for PMS.
4035470	4038130	But anyway, back to the car.
4040558	4052971	When he took it in, this was... The car, first of all, has the 10-year warranty on it, bumper-to-bumper warranty.
4053932	4062761	So he took the car in and they said, well, you know, we have to strip it down to look at the transmission and if it's your fault, you pay $1,100 to fix it.
4064378	4071120	Well, first of all, if you don't drive your car like shit, then there's no reason for the transmission to go out.
4071900	4079282	So, um, he said, the hell with that, um, and said, you're not gonna, you know, you're not gonna charge me for taking it apart, you're gonna do the diagnostic on it.
4079722	4081743	Like, fine, then warranty won't cover it.
4082163	4090645	So he gets on the line with the, um, uh, with the, I guess, the Mitsubishi corporate, they have a big stink over it.
4090965	4092986	He said the customer service girl was friendly, but...
4093772	4120958	said that um the uh the caseworker was all like okay look we're gonna have them break down the uh the car for free it's our dime which they should have done in the first place hi and then they said if the um if they determine uh the transmission thing is his fault then they'll put it back together for free and let him take it wherever he feels that he needs to to pay less for it but um
4122228	4131354	If I start talking about how much I love my new WRX STI, you'll find out what happened.
4131834	4132955	I'm reading comments from chat.
4132975	4134936	We had someone named TheUterus join chat.
4135236	4137257	That says, don't let your uterus drive your car.
4137998	4139759	And Ranma says, fucking cunt.
4139779	4141360	And I'm going to say, don't talk to Jamie like that.
4141400	4141960	That's rude.
4142500	4144962	I know, he was saying someone else.
4146403	4150025	Let's see, and then also, but Ranma did say this, which I thought was really funny.
4150581	4157664	So if Jack equals Voldemort, that means that Jamie equals Hermione, Skye equals Harry, and Loki equals Ron.
4158005	4161706	Dude, that means that I get Victor Crumb, and then the movie is kind of hot.
4164227	4165648	Well, what do I get, Cho Chang?
4167169	4168049	Hippity-doo-dah.
4168149	4168710	Alright, anyway.
4168930	4169370	Was that it?
4169590	4169870	Uh-huh.
4170270	4171351	Are you and your uterus done?
4171731	4175833	Except she was really cool with this being, having that thick Scottish accent.
4175873	4176853	I totally didn't expect it.
4176893	4178034	Are you and your uterus finished?
4180094	4181956	I wish that men had cramps.
4184259	4186082	We do get cramps of a different sort.
4186102	4189746	No, I wish that men had hormone-related cramps.
4191989	4193291	I would love it.
4195073	4197696	Maybe someday you can have balls.
4197896	4199118	And so I can kick you in them.
4199594	4201575	Alright, uh, Loki.
4201895	4205256	Well, I wish women could drive better, but we don't always get what we want, do we now?
4205276	4205896	You know what?
4206116	4206677	That's you.
4207297	4210938	We did figure out why, we did figure out though why women drive bad.
4210998	4218961	It's because estrogen causes you to have, you know, I don't know, some sort of balance problems or like, you know, the world spins or something.
4218981	4219481	I don't know.
4220082	4222203	We're just going to use that as an excuse for now.
4222443	4223143	I drive really well.
4223163	4225144	There's going to be a fight in the parking lot after the show.
4225164	4226284	I drive, Rob.
4226444	4226764	What?
4227124	4228705	I drive really well.
4229335	4230956	You drive like a bat out of hell.
4231016	4235200	I mean, you do get us from point A to point B the quickest way possible.
4235220	4237642	I'll give you that.
4237662	4239083	But I don't cut people off.
4239643	4241185	I don't talk on my phone while I drive.
4241205	4242886	I'm like somebody in this room.
4242906	4245708	You cast hexes on people when you drive.
4245748	4247129	And they get out of my way.
4247470	4249051	Loki, finish.
4250492	4252814	I don't even remember what my FU of the week was, too.
4256022	4266210	So yeah, I'm just going to say bad to women drivers because there's been a lot of them, especially driving slow or they can't seem to navigate that minivan.
4266270	4269032	It's like, if you can't fucking drive a car, just stay at home.
4269272	4271454	Just fuck everybody who drives a minivan.
4272975	4273956	That doesn't need one of those.
4275239	4278700	And I swear to God I fucking hate people that drive, you know, SUVs.
4279340	4286441	Off-road vehicles, mind you, that have to go over the fucking speed bumps like it's, like their car's made of glass.
4286701	4288141	It's a fucking off-road car.
4288281	4290242	It should be able to handle a damn little speed bump.
4290362	4292482	I know my car could go over that super fast.
4292842	4293582	Why can't yours?
4294102	4295642	Oh my God, I'm having to loop the music.
4295662	4297103	We're going to six minutes here.
4297523	4299003	Actually, I have one, I have one more thing.
4299023	4299423	Oh, goody.
4299683	4300183	I have one more.
4300423	4300743	Alright.
4301243	4304464	F you to people who think that just because you're married you need to start breeding.
4306641	4307642	Moo!
4307802	4308722	Moo!
4309983	4313365	First of all, children do not save a marriage.
4313785	4314786	It makes it worse.
4316447	4321510	Secondly, if you can't afford... This is episode part FU, because that's all this segment's going to be.
4321530	4324191	Secondly, if you cannot afford the child, don't have one!
4325752	4331776	Thirdly, if I say I don't want children, fucking respect what I have to say.
4333234	4337177	Don't keep pushing it until I go puke in the bathroom at Cattleman's.
4338598	4339079	Thank you.
4340240	4341481	Can I do my FUs now?
4341761	4342101	No.
4342962	4344984	Okay, fine.
4345424	4347486	My FU of the week also goes to Jamie's uterus.
4348286	4350528	And then I would like to say an FU... Just kidding, heart.
4350868	4351509	I don't think she heard me.
4351789	4353010	My uterus, my choice.
4353691	4356293	I would also like to give an F and it's my choice to say FU.
4356693	4357094	Just kidding.
4357414	4359155	Heart, love you.
4359195	4361177	No, seriously, I want to say FU to dentistry.
4362165	4363066	Thanks for watching!
4384346	4386948	I feel like going to the dentist is like going to used car salesman sometimes.
4386968	4387729	There's so much pressure.
4388029	4389511	No wonder people are afraid of the dentist.
4389811	4390552	I'm not afraid of the dentist.
4390592	4392494	I just fall asleep.
4392634	4394055	It's not the drill work I'm afraid of.
4394095	4395436	I'm afraid of the way they treat people.
4395797	4396037	Anyway.
4396157	4397098	You should go to my dentist.
4397118	4397719	He's really cool.
4397739	4400101	I don't think my insurance will let me, but that's a whole other F you.
4400401	4402703	F you to your testicles, by the way.
4402723	4403084	Thank you.
4403124	4404145	Oh, sure, sure.
4404245	4404545	Anytime.
4406767	4407468	F you, Jamie.
4409136	4410256	Thank God this is radio.
4410537	4412097	Your tattoos sound like Grover.
4416759	4417419	Well, they're blue.
4422221	4425222	Welcome to Octaves of Jamie that you normally don't listen.
4426142	4431404	I don't know if it's picking up because she doesn't have the mic near her, but she's going about three octaves higher than we usually hear.
4431424	4433485	Okay.
4437981	4438061	Far!
4438121	4438221	Far!
4438241	4438322	Far!
4438342	4438402	Far!
4452372	4453553	Thank God this was a radio.
4454874	4469766	Speaking of near and far, one game that's near dear to my heart, Grand Theft Auto, is doing really well far away in Japan, where Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has taken number one in their sales charts.
4470603	4499610	that is right beating out such DS titles as those brain training things fuck brain training it's all about killing hookers that's really what Japan needs and god damn it they just got their dose of killing hookers so way to go Japan you just need to get on the bandwagon now with Grand Theft Auto 4 then I could be killing I don't know more hookers from Japan Kevin DDR says what GTA can't do well in Japan it's doing well now it's number one
4500273	4500353	Rob...
4525401	4526782	Winners don't use drugs.
4526923	4528644	Remember the FBI warning.
4528964	4529624	What?
4529704	4531846	Rob, never do that again.
4532166	4535588	It was funny and you know it.
4535608	4536189	Never do that.
4536889	4539631	Speaking of blue things, Sonic the Hedgehog is...
4543530	4544190	Dirt Devil, Upright Vacuum
4565868	4569910	Remember when they were selling the Wii for like, what was it, $1,119?
4570290	4571570	Whatever was the release date.
4571630	4572811	Somebody screwed up the database.
4572831	4573671	Something similar happened here.
4573691	4576072	Maybe they just found out that Sonic the Hedgehog sucked.
4576212	4576712	Ha ha!
4576772	4577652	I see what you did there.
4578313	4581874	Because I hadn't heard that joke a million times already on Kotaku.
4582654	4583014	Alright.
4584315	4586215	Speaking of games that suck.
4587516	4588376	Unexpected.
4588456	4589517	This is like totally rad.
4591677	4592718	Burger King had...
4594358	4601682	They reported higher than anticipated quarterly earnings because of the Xbox 360 promo games.
4601963	4603564	At least that's what they figured.
4604144	4609607	The games actually pulled sales up to $38 million in the U.S.
4609767	4610168	alone.
4610188	4617352	How can these games have gone double-platinum?
4618345	4620467	I guess with the fact that they were four bucks a piece.
4621308	4627674	Because there are two million achievement point whores in the world who just needed the extra 600 points that these games would give.
4628375	4629175	Is actually what happened.
4629295	4629736	I guess.
4630416	4632719	They're also now 99 cents each.
4633299	4633980	I heard about that.
4634000	4634801	That's crazy.
4635301	4638144	So, if you haven't bought them yet... There are two that I still need.
4638184	4639045	I only have Sneak King.
4639945	4641567	Yeah, if you haven't bought it yet,
4642017	4642717	Might as well do it.
4642797	4645458	I mean, because 99 cents, that's not bad for a game.
4645758	4646539	Even if it does suck.
4646559	4648659	These will be collector's things before too long.
4649400	4650960	It'll be as rare as Rondo of Blood.
4651820	4652381	Okay, maybe not.
4653521	4654821	Anyway, let's go.
4654841	4656222	But Nowhere Near is awesome.
4656822	4660683	Let's hear what games are coming out very soon that could soon become collector's items.
4660984	4663504	You have any exclusives for us this week, Loki, on release dates?
4663664	4666045	No, because I took time off work.
4666085	4666385	I see.
4666625	4668026	And there wasn't really, you know.
4668812	4670193	much to mention anyway.
4670313	4677795	Well, we mentioned everything probably last week, and anything exclusive would have been at Konami's Gamer Day and all that fun stuff.
4678476	4679256	What was I going to say, though?
4679536	4681677	But this week, though, there's some good stuff coming out.
4682217	4692841	If you are a fan of Winning Eleven, you'll be happy to know that that is finally making its way out now on PlayStation 2, on the 360, DS, and PSP.
4693161	4694182	So that's pretty awesome.
4695362	4697323	Also, there's going to be...
4699231	4701912	Actually, there's not a lot of PlayStation 2 games coming out this week.
4701952	4702832	I know that for a fact.
4703812	4710294	I do believe the Final Fantasy 6 comes out on the Game Boy Advance this week, which is pretty awesome.
4712015	4715776	So definitely check that out, because I know... What was it?
4716116	4716816	5 did really well.
4716856	4717616	Everybody's picking up 5.
4718597	4726559	There should be some more Wii's and DS lights coming to... I want to say to all the retailers this week as well, because I know...
4728046	4729527	They've been out of stock for a long time.
4729547	4731968	They were actually sold out at Nintendo for like the last two weeks.
4733609	4740972	But, um, let's see, other than that stuff, well, it was just a whole lot of crap coming out this week.
4742393	4745635	So I want to say that's probably, you know, what I'd really, oh, how could I forget this?
4745915	4748216	Diddy Kong Racing DS, that's coming out.
4748256	4749757	I've been seeing commercials for that.
4749897	4752298	If you want to, you know, get your fix on like kind of, uh,
4753044	4754445	Mario Kart-type racing game.
4754665	4755326	And this is kind of cool.
4755346	4757668	You've got a create-your-own-track mode.
4757688	4759970	You basically draw a track with the stylus, so that's kind of neat.
4760690	4765995	Artolico on PlayStation 2, another Atlus RPG, so definitely worth checking out.
4766215	4773561	If you're into puzzle games, Capcom Puzzle World on the PSP, so that was pretty fun because it has Puzzle Fighter on it.
4774221	4778745	Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI on PlayStation 2, if you're a fan of that.
4779707	4783751	and then MVP07 NCAA Baseball if you're into college baseball on PlayStation 2.
4784612	4790838	I just want to say release date-wise, because I don't know if you explicitly stated this on an earlier show, but we did confirm that DDR Universe is February 27th.
4790918	4791298	Yeah.
4791939	4794241	So, almost March, but not quite.
4794462	4797945	And I'd also like to mention Lunar Nights on the DS is coming out this week.
4798245	4798806	Oh, very cool.
4799647	4801689	Good, that was a neat title, I might have to pick that up.
4802645	4808727	All right, coming out in Japan, we like to cover Japanese release dates, too, because sometimes it's kind of interesting to see what they get a lot later.
4809027	4812548	And also, what they get over there now, we may be getting over here pretty soon.
4812868	4814288	And I wonder if this might be one of them.
4814348	4818689	On the Xbox 360, they're getting a badly needed role-playing game this week.
4818709	4822530	Because, you know, Xbox kind of gets a lot of slack for not having a lot of choice when it comes to role-playing games.
4822570	4826471	I mean, sure, you have Phantasy Star, which is kind of borderline, and then you have Enchanted Arms.
4826771	4829092	But they're getting a new game this week from Type.com.
4829728	4830889	from Idea Factory.
4831710	4834672	It's called Diario Rebirth Moon Legend.
4834712	4839436	It's a new RPG coming out on the Xbox 360 coming out in Japan on the 8th.
4840057	4844040	Also coming out in Japan this week on the 8th, Fusion Frenzy 2 on the Xbox 360.
4844701	4849945	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Virtua Fighter 5 makes its way this week on February 8th.
4850485	4851206	That should be pretty cool.
4851246	4852987	It's also coming out with a little stick.
4853047	4854869	A Virtua stick is coming out just for that game.
4855970	4859352	also coming out on the Nintendo Wii guess what, Jamie?
4860933	4882022	Minato Ishii ni Oruyoi Taikai that's the subtitle for Cooking Mama on the Wii coming out this week by Taito over there in Japan oh, she's over here to correct me my horrible pronunciations Minato Ishii ni Oruyoi Taikai I'm getting better Taikai give me that, I'm getting better
4882287	4882787	You're getting better.
4882968	4887692	Alright, and coming out on the PlayStation 2, OutRun 2 is coming out.
4888653	4899582	Stella Deuce, and one of my favorite title names for this week coming from Capcom, Full House Kiss 2 is coming out on the PlayStation 2.
4901284	4907689	And the cover for Full House Kiss 2, it's four guys all surrounding a chick holding a bouquet.
4908350	4909231	So you know what that means.
4910135	4911176	Aw, Dating Sim.
4911256	4913758	They're all going to go banger.
4915060	4923627	Coming out on other systems in the Nintendo DS has Jet Impulse and Luminous Arc and Morita Shogi on the DS, all coming out this week.
4924468	4926209	And lastly, do we have anything on the PSP?
4926269	4926610	We do!
4927170	4931834	New Rainbow Island, Hurdy Gurdy Daibouken is coming out this week.
4931914	4933836	That should be tons of fun, I'm sure.
4933856	4934737	Rainbow Island!
4934957	4935958	I know, but it's kind of like...
4936618	4937238	Rainbow Island!
4937258	4937859	Rainbow Island!
4958527	4963328	We have coming out February 6th, War Rock on PC.
4964029	4968830	On the 8th, Sam & Max Episode 3, The Mole, The Mob, and The Meatball on PC.
4970110	4972651	On the 9th, though, just a crap ton of games.
4972831	4975092	Avatar, The Last Airbender on damn near everything.
4976973	4981754	Battle Stations Midway, Battlezone, Blade Dancer, Lineage of Light.
4983486	5010056	Bomberman, Charlotte's Web, Deep Labyrinth, Maelstrom, Magical Star Sign, Metal Slug Anthology, Naruto, Ultimate Ninja, Okami, Saint Seiya, The Hades, Space Vampires 5, The Professor's Brain Trainer, Logic and Memory, The Sims Life Stories, Thrillville, Totally Spies 2, Undercover, and that's it so far.
5010683	5011063	Cry Cry Cry Cry
5041542	5041862	Sob.
5042662	5045463	Weep.
5045503	5045763	QQ.
5046383	5053805	One movie that doesn't really need to be made is definitely spawned from a game with lots of sequels, DOA the movie.
5054685	5058466	Originally it was going to be a theatrical movie, but then apparently they realized, hey, you know what?
5058486	5065327	This movie really sucks, so let's just release it straight to DVD, which means that someone dumped it to the internet.
5066288	5067628	Doesn't the movie have Ali Larder in it?
5069508	5075633	Allie Larder is the one chick on Heroes that nobody likes her storyline.
5075873	5079916	Is she the one who plays the split personality?
5080977	5082898	I haven't even watched any and I know who that is.
5083999	5085200	I think she's in the movie, right?
5085420	5088543	The only thing I saw was a scene of her in that place.
5090704	5091325	Spoilers!
5091765	5092766	I told Rob.
5093226	5096689	It is available on Google Video and to be honest...
5097208	5102311	If you really want to watch the whole thing, I guess it's better than spending the money to rent it or buy it.
5102452	5108776	But really, I just hear it's just yet another really bad movie.
5109556	5110077	It won't play.
5112018	5116381	Well, I think they had originally it linked on... Don't they keep taking it down and stuff?
5116441	5118322	It keeps getting taken down, but it is...
5119077	5127299	It does come back up, and if you read the Kotaku story, which links to the Destructoid story... It's like that Natalie Portman video when she rapped on SNL.
5127339	5131820	They just kept taking it off of YouTube, and it kept coming right back.
5131900	5135801	But here's what you can do if you really want to watch it and keep it or whatever.
5135841	5145443	You can always download the PSP or iPod versions, and you can download those straight to your PC, if you don't want to stream it later on.
5146168	5153075	Uh, Brad from PodCulture, which is another indie podcast, is in our chat room right now and says, LOL, we just reviewed that on our latest episode.
5153496	5156339	So if you want to hear Brad's review of Dead or Alive the movie.
5156738	5167127	Check out podculture.blogspot.com This whole movie could have been made a lot better and worth watching if it were rated NC-17 and there was more nudity.
5167427	5170489	Because right now, as it stands, there is no nudity in it.
5170609	5175553	So that is the main problem to why this... Because it doesn't matter if the movie sucked.
5175774	5177675	As long as it had nudity, it would have been great.
5181238	5183440	Whoever's playing this Rondo of Blood is really bad.
5184121	5184361	I mean...
5184972	5190216	How about the... You know, one of those sites taped me playing one of the game.
5190236	5193179	I don't know who did it, but you know how like they do the... Did you keep getting picked up by the dragon?
5193739	5193979	No.
5194440	5195220	Then this isn't you.
5195320	5195661	Oh, good.
5197042	5197783	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5224048	5225329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5244874	5248217	and he had practiced before making cinematic versions of the game.
5248598	5250199	So it should be interesting.
5250460	5256145	He's also made Audition, Chakushin Ari and one of Loki's favorites, Ichi the Killer.
5257186	5258427	Ichi the Killer is awesome.
5258527	5262571	So he should be very excited about this new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan.
5262831	5266654	Because if they tear some guy's face off and throw it against a wall, I mean, I don't see how that could be bad.
5267295	5267875	Like in Ichi the Killer.
5267895	5268376	Ichi the Killer.
5268977	5269457	E.G.
5269477	5271118	the Killer is lost.
5291929	5305380	A major UK retailer, HMV, their online store is taking pre-orders for PlayStation 3s, but you have to also purchase a 4GB PSP pack, so you'll be paying a total of £675.
5309727	5317531	They're sending an email out that will say you become one of the lucky few who can pick up the PlayStation 3 at launch.
5318051	5327736	The quote says, at hmv.co.uk, we've been working with Sony to offer up to 5,000 customers an incredible deal when you buy the new Sony 4GB PSP.
5328056	5333359	Anyone who takes advantage of this offer will get priority over other hmv.co.uk customers for the PlayStation 3.
5334219	5341726	The deal also includes two PSP games, Kills and Liberation and Gangs of London for the price of $6.74.99.
5344288	5352335	Are they expecting the same mass hysteria over there in the UK that they had over here at first, which then after Christmas just kind of dropped off like a rock?
5352475	5355918	Because that's the kind of shit we saw them doing over here when it came out.
5356178	5358080	People went crazy and then realized the Wii was better.
5359625	5363106	Well, again, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.
5363326	5364646	So the Wii is better.
5364666	5366747	Yeah, and the Wii had Zelda and all that.
5366767	5369908	There's one good PlayStation 3 game out right now.
5370908	5371008	One.
5371949	5373309	I really hope more comes out.
5373349	5383592	I mean, it's not that I want to see Sony fail, and it's not that I want to make fun of Sony, and I love my PlayStation 2, but goddamn, Sony.
5383612	5384512	They're making it easy for us.
5384632	5385072	I know.
