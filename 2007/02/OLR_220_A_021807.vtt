Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco

00:12.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, February 18th, 2007, new arcade games are revealed, including Tekken 6 and Silent Hill.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Someone in the know violates Microsoft's partner, NetNDA, and could rare be developing something for a Nintendo platform?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
and a little bit of gaming culture, geek culture, pop culture types of fare.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm here to help you through the next few hours of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Ah!

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Whoa, the angsty, loud Dark Sakura. How are you?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Um, I hate people.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm sorry to hear it. Why do you hate people?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Because they drive slowly.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
What are you talking about?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
And cut me off in traffic.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
It's always traffic with you, girl. What is it this time?

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
No, no, I also hate Starbucks for their extra hot tea that we got for you that scalded me.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
I need tea. If you can't tell, my voice is a little bit off tonight again,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
because I was screaming at Rocky last night, and you know, now I'm paying for today.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm still on the tin can mic. Although, I listened to last week's playback,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
and what I noticed is that I was very loud, so I apologize for that,

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
so I've adjusted the audio for this week.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
That's okay, we're used to it.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
But on the playback, because it's a lowered bit rate on the podcast,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
it didn't sound as bad. It didn't sound as tin can.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
As usual?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
So I don't think it'll be so bad.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
The show sucked, but I was good.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Really?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm just kidding.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm just kidding.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
That's surprising.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
No. What? What the?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm doing it the whole time, and you're like, lalalalala.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Have you been like snorting crack today?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
No, I had a frappuccino.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Oh, goodie.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Here we go, it's another one of those shows.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
A crappuccino?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Say hello as well to Loki.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
I forgot that I turned the mic off, so I didn't catch that last comment.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
That's why I didn't call you a tech mouse to Loki tonight,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
because apparently you forgot how to work sound equipment. Good job.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
The winner is you.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Hey.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
We hope you have enjoyed.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I know how to use sound equipment.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Do you?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yes.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
All right.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Well, we have some special guests with us in the studio tonight.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
They're extra special. They have their own bus.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
It's going to be another very interesting week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
The feedback from last week is that you guys liked a little bit of the silliness we had going on last week,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
so we brought some of the silliest people we know to the program.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Say hello to one of the Orange Lounge Radio...

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Oh, god damn it.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh, I get the mailbag.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
No. No mailbag for you. Sorry.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Apparently none of us remember how to use sound tonight.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Say hello to one of the Orange Lounge Radio lesbians. Chris.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Hi, kids.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
How are you doing, Chris?

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
Well, I just had Starbucks, so I'm a little bit more awake, so I'm okay.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
It's been a long weekend.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Propagino. Propagino.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Say hello to one of the Orange Lounge Radio gays, Casper the Gay.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm yummy.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Are you trying to imitate my voice in the opening?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
No.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
And also say hello to somebody brand new.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
She's losing her Orange Lounge cherry tonight.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
She's brand new to the program.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
It's Marissa.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Hello.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
How are you, Marissa?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I love it when you talk nerdy to me.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
All right.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Marissa is the originator of Uta's brassieres.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
I would like to point out, whatever brassiere Marissa has on tonight, you know, I might be gay, but I can't help but look.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Marissa, you have to do it for the listeners so that they hear the original Uta's brassieres.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Should I do it right now or later?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Sure. Why not? Why not?

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
Well, the Uta's brassiere thing originated because I am a A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-A-B-H-H-H-H.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
No.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
For all you nerds out there, I am wearing a...

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I'm a geek too. I'm just a music geek.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
I am a double G.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
So my sisters were complaining about the types of bras that they get to wear.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
And I thought this was the most ridiculous thing ever because it is awkward changing in the locker room.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
But they have all these choices, you know, spangly this and clear straps this and that and, you know,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
zebra bras and all they get to wear are Uta's brassieres.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
You know, Nazi bras from the Third Reich.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
You won't wear them and you will like them.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
In old country, teeth did not fly free.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
They were disciplined and they stood at attention like rockets.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
So that's where it came from.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Of course, we have our chat room.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
We would never have a show complete without our chat room.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Is the chat room going insane?

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, the minute Marissa says double G.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Alpha Catagram says double G.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Shadow's Liar says this is the best show ever.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Fire Bulma says keep this girl.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Now, because the show is about video games, we need to kind of confess.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Marissa, you're not a hardcore gamer, are you?

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
No, because I've been depressed ever since they stopped making King's Quest.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Okay, but so you used to play like the old school adventure games, right?

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh, I was obsessed with it, yeah. I was obsessed with all of them.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Have you heard about the King's Quest fan project?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
The Silver Lining? We host the demo on orangeonshooter.com.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
I hadn't heard of the brand new one, although I downloaded, I guess,

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Sierra as opposed to Sierra and made remakes of the really, really old school ones.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I think I downloaded those.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I remember hearing about that. Cool.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Did you play Space Quest and some of the other stuff too?

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Space Quest, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is my personal favorite.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I love that one. Sam & Max Full Throttle.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
God, you know, I had scum VM on my computer, so I just relived all of my memories on that.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
But I didn't get into Siberia, which I was told I was supposed to like Siberia

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
because it was the new adventure game, but it did get a little boring.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Sometimes it's tough to live up to the classics, you know, when people say,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
oh, there's this new game out and it's like the classic.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
But then you play it and it's really not, you know.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
It's true, but I think a lot of the appeal of the adventure games was the humor,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
and Siberia kind of lacked that.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I've been eaten by a grue.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I've got to say, Jared J. in chat says, she loves King's Quest?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Oh, my God, marry me.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Marissa's taken, yes?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Oh, yes, but for a little self-whoring,

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
MySpace.com slash Marissa Meisel, M-A-R-I-S-S-A M-E-I-Z-E-L.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
It's like Marissa Meisel. I'm a musician.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I was going to say, you know, of course, when guests come on real radio,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
they pimp out their stuff, so you're actually a legit musician.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
What kind of music do you do?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Folk rock without it being too whiny.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Folk rock. That's a genre. That's pretty awesome.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Acoustic guitar, yes.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Is that like Enya hardcore?

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
Who can say where the dub goes, where the duh-duh, only time.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
It's like Peter, Paul, and Mary with electric guitar.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Puff the Magic Dragon, fuck you.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
That whole thing? That's cool.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
All right, I was going to say, as a legitimate musician,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
what do you think about Guitar Hero?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Is this a good ho-ho-ho or a bad ho-ho-ho?

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Okay, what? Really quickly so we can get to the crux of the show here.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
What do you think of Guitar Hero? Good thing, bad thing?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
I've already sworn on the show. Am I allowed to again?

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
It's on the Internet. Fuck, shit, cock, cunt, piss, whore, whatever you want.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
I fucking hate Guitar Hero!

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Why do you hate Guitar Hero?

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
Well, I guess it's fun, but learning to play guitar gets you laid.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
Playing video game guitar, it's not.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
Well, no, it's only good fun, and I like that it brings attention to classic music,

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
but the most interesting part is that musicians suck at Guitar Hero,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
just like real dancers suck at DDR.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
It's true. They have videos of guys on the Internet

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
playing their own songs on Guitar Heroes, and they fucking suck at them.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Like, it's sad.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
It's really, really funny.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Meg Z, when she has a Guitar Hero demo set up at her GameStop,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
and they sit there and they ask her,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
so does this teach you how to play a real guitar?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
She goes, no, it doesn't.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
No, but that's what it advertises. No, it doesn't.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
And she has to get through to people to tell them it does not teach you how to play guitar.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
I would like to say Jared Jay has changed his mind on Marissa.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Oh, shit, now I hate you. Go fuck a goat.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Go fuck a goat.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Aw.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
But classic rock is good, huh?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
You'll learn to embrace when the listeners tell you to go fuck things.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
I like go fuck a cactus. That's my favorite.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Does that give me any points?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Rice Princess is going to make a cameo real quick.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Hi, Irene.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Oh, Marissa, Rice Princess.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Sorry, I'm introducing myself. Hi, Chris.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Rice Princess, Irene.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay, what's up, Rice Princess? How you doing?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm okay. I'm sick.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
You brought a posse with you. What is this?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I brought my posse.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Introduce your posse real quick.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Okay, this is Chance.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Hey, what's up?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Real quickly, because we're not going to have time to have everybody on the show.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Chance, what type of games do you like?

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
PS2 games, like RPG games and action games.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Wow.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Wow and World of Warcraft?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Wow, yeah.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
How about board games like Cold Set? Ever play that?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
No, I play Axis and Allies and Risk.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Oh, you're like an old school gamer.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Okay, you like to do it the slow way. All right, who else is here?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
My brother, Chris.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Hi, brother Chris.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
What's up?

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
What type of games are you into, brother Chris?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I don't play video games. They're the devil.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
He doesn't play video games.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
He plays WoW.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
We're not picking him up on the mic either, but he says he doesn't play video games.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm Chris and I am a butt.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
All right, video games suck.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
And this is Heather.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Hi, Heather.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Hi, Heather. Come up real quick.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
You can't be shy.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
How are you, Heather?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Great. How are you?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Good. Do you play video games?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Kind of. I'm a button masher. Sorry to say.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Button masher? What type of games do you play? Get the mic a little closer to your mouth.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Halo, Soul Calibur, Burnout.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Are you any good at Gears of War?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Never played it.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
We're looking for some good players for Gears of War for something I can't talk about yet,

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
but we need to put together a team for Gears of War, and I'm very scared.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Interesting.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Pick that one up and check it out.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Okay.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Okay? And let me know how it goes. All right.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
So what is this now, Rice Princess? Is this, like, one of those, like, swelled ego things after the last show?

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You, you know, you got, like, a fan letter, and now you have this swelled ego.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Hey, you know what? I got two.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And she has to have an entourage everywhere she goes.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Okay, no, no. I got two fan letters now.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah, I'm taking over your show now. Sorry, Rob.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
No.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Now, did you know that I'm moving in again?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
This will be the last week of Orange Lounge Radio.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Hope you enjoyed the program while it lasted.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Shut up.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
All right.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
All right, anyway.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Okay, I'm going to let you get back.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
This is from show one.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Irene, you were here for show one, weren't you?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I totally was.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
That was three studios ago.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah, seriously, I remember.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
All right, well, just like old times, you should go clean my kitchen.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Just like old times, I should punch you in your gong.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
All right.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
All right, anyway, we got to keep the show moving.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
We got to get back to games.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Here you go.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Let's start. How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
For my gaming, I did massage.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
Actually, no, we, Dan repaired our whodunnit, so I actually played some pinball.

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
And I played, I brought my PS2 over here, and we never played it.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I heard you brought it over here for Silent Hill,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
but the meek latov was like, no, my panties are bunched too tight.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I can't play Silent Hill tonight.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Well, I also brought Crazy Taxi, and we didn't play it.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Crazy money.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
For PS2?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
You can only play that on Dreamcast.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I'm sorry.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I just grabbed a handful of stuff.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
All right.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Interesting.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
That's it?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Really?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Nothing else?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
That's all right.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
That's all right.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
You're a busy girl.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Can't play games all the time.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
My gaming week was fun.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
I played all, basically I just played only Crackdown, the full Crackdown.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah, you got the retail release, right?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Yeah.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah, so you're one of those bastards that got it early.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Because street dates don't apply to me.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Okay, well, sorry.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
So yeah, I'm about two-thirds way through the game already, and it's worth it.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
I really cannot wait until everyone else gets it so I can play some co-op.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
It's actually pretty funny, because if you watch some of the AI, especially the AI drivers,

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
they're horrible.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
In fact, I was trying to kill this one guy, and I heard all this crashing going on below

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
me, and there was a freeway below me, so I got on the edge and looked down, and there

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
was this giant pileup of cars, and you can actually see cars being ejected out of the

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
tunnel and just getting thrown into the ocean, and it was hilarious, and I had nothing to

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
do with it.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
It was just the crabby AI drivers just crashed into each other and just launched cars into

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
the air.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Some Crackdown comments from our chatroom at chat.orangehonestradio.com.

13:14.000 --> 13:22.000
Let's see, olarmyblaze says, okay, well, whoop-de-fucking-doo, Mr. I work in distribution.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
But jeremytel1 has a serious question.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Loki, is the game too easy like I think it will be?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Like, are all the bosses really easy to kill once you start leveling up?

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
It gets harder as you go on, because the first, the Los Maritos bosses are pretty easy, but

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
then when you get to the second, the Volk are a lot harder.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
They're not necessarily harder to kill, but it's more elaborate to get to them.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
You can't just climb a building and boom, there they are.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
And then everybody starts carrying rocket launchers, and it just gets a little complicated.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
So, it does get harder as you go on.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
It's just, also, I mean, there are three different difficulties, so if you're playing now the

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
standard one, it is going to be pretty easy going through the whole game, but, you know,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
if you want more of a challenge, play on a harder difficulty.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
But I think you'll be, at least, you know, play through the whole game, and then, you

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
know, if you want to go back and play it harder, definitely play the more challenging difficulties.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
I think, as it is, it gets kind of hard, especially when you get towards the last gang, the Asian

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
gang, it's just, they're crazy, the amount of people that they throw at you, so, I don't

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
know, it does get harder, though.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Alright.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Anything else at your gaming week besides Crackdown?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories still.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Still, after all this time.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh yeah, we'll be playing until the next game comes out.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Alright.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
One other question here, Jay Dorian asks, low-key, how does the full game's world compare

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
to the demo?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
How much bigger does it feel?

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
Well, the demo, it was just pretty much half of the first island, it's not even the whole

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
first island, and the game feels huge, I mean, like, you get, I can't recognize certain areas

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
of the game, I mean, you can get lost pretty easy in it, so it does feel very large, it's,

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
there's a ton of places to explore, I've been practically everywhere in these last, the

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
first two islands or whatever, and I've only found about less than a third of the secret

15:12.000 --> 15:22.000
orbs, and just over half of the agility orbs, and I'm already, I've already maxed out my

15:22.000 --> 15:31.000
strength, and I'm about to max out my explosives, so it's, I mean, it, there's just a ton of

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
stuff to explore.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
I did like the achievement, there's one achievement for killing people with this globe, it's a

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
giant globe that you find at the observatory.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Is it like the Lochmar?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
No.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
It's like a giant, like, metal globe, and you have to kill 15 people with it, and that

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
was fun.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Do you bowl them over or something?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Something like that, you basically kind of toss it onto them.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Throw it at their head.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Yeah, throw it at their head.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Interesting.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I kill people all the time by throwing things at their head.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
It's just, the fun part's gonna be coming to, I think, the co-op gameplay, because you

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
can just run around and do whatever the fuck you want in that game, that's gonna be fun,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
and what's kind of neat about it, and you don't really notice this in the demo, the

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
full game, you can actually have people jump in and out of your game while you're playing,

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
so.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
I heard about that, that sounds pretty intuitive, but is that as good as it sounds, you think?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah, it's just gonna be people jumping in and out, and you don't necessarily have to

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
play with them, they'll just, you know, they can go fuck around in your city or whatever,

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
so that's gonna be kind of cool, and then, I think, I remember hearing a long time ago

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
that one of the downloads that they were gonna have for Crackdown was a replay editor or

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
something like that, where you can record your own gameplay, so that might be pretty

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
fun to share that with people.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Anything else?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
That's it.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Alright, real quickly, I haven't done a lot this week.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
I finally have taken a WoW character, World of Warcraft, further than I ever have before.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
My character finally hit level 30, so I got, thank you, thank you.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
I got Cheetah Form finally, and I'm halfway to 60, but now that means nothing, because

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
70 is the new cap, so.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
But, as I swore to myself before, if I make it all the way to 40, I will finally buy Burning

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Crusade, because that means I must actually be into Warcraft enough.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
I don't have Burning Crusade yet, because I don't see the point of getting it, if I'm

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
not gonna.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Blood elves!

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Blood elves are awesome, but seriously, on my server, everyone is playing Blood elves.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Everyone.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah, I'll talk about that later.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Alright, and then I also played Paperboy, which is awesome.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
On the Xbox 360, the old game, it translates pretty well to the Xbox 360, I gotta say,

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
because the game itself was kinda widescreen, like a little bit, like if you remember the

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
old cabinet it was in, it was kinda widescreen, so they didn't have to smush it or anything,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
and the vertical bars aren't quite as big.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
The achievements are kinda smart, they're not like really super duper easy, but not

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
super duper hard either, like the previous games, but I think Paperboy itself was a much

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
harder game than I remember.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
Paperboy is one of those few truly original games, so definitely I recommend you guys

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
check out the demo if you're 360 owners, because if you never played Paperboy, at least play

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
the first level that the demo gives you, I think you'll find it's creative enough and

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
original enough of a game to necessitate buying the full game.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
And they have co-op modes, and I think there's a competitive mode, I can't remember, because

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
I haven't taken it online yet, because most of my week's been on Warcraft, unfortunately.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
I tried to get more achievements in Fusion Frenzy 2, but honestly, I couldn't tolerate

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
the game long enough to do it.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
Like I got so fed up, I was like, oh my god, this game sucks, I turned it off.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
I was like, it's not worth it.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
I don't care what achievement point challenges are going on right now, I will earn them somewhere

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
else.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I can't do it.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Fusion Frenzy 2 is just that bad.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Chris, how was your gaming week?

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
I have become a World of Warcraft nerd.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Congratulations!

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, clap for me, I need it.

18:51.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah, I just, I'm on only two of the servers, one is the noob one, which is where everyone

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
starts out.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Hydraxis, I think?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
I don't know, I can't pronounce names.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
And I've got like ten characters on there that haven't even reached level 15.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
That's alright, you've got to start somewhere.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Yeah, and then I've got, but I have Burning Crusades, because if I'm going to get it,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
I'm going to get all of it.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
And it's really funny, on both the elves, because you know, when you start off a new

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
character, they all start with that little cinema, and they all say it with the elves,

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
it's like, it's like the elves, like, the last of their races, everybody is a fucking

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
elf!

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
Everyone is a blood elf, everyone is a night elf, they're all over, like, they're all

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
over the frickin' place, it's like, last of my, last of the race, my ass.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
But the Draenei, oh my god, I don't care what anyone says, those things are hot.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
I love the Draenei.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
The Draenei girls are pretty hot.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Ugh, their Russian accents make me horny.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Please don't hold back.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
I love those things so much, I think they were supposed to be something else, but I

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
like them being aliens, it's amusing.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
Every time I hear the Draenei females speak, though, I can't help but think, Boris, look,

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
it's Musen's room!

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah, it was, it's like, not enough rage!

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
You know, I just love those things.

20:05.000 --> 20:12.000
So, if anyone wants to find me, I get, I mean, go to Jamie's MySpace, I'm on MySpace, so

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
You're in my top eight.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
She's in, I'm in her top eight.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
You're in the Orange Lounge top, actually.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I am?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
You are.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
I feel so special.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
You are.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Yeah, send me a note, I'll tell you who I am.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Seriously, I suck, I don't know how to type in general yet.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
You know how, like, when you, so if somebody knows, please inform me.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
I seriously don't, I know how, like, I know how to type.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
You type slash one.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Really?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Slash one, space, and then whatever you want to say.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Oh, god dammit.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
You know, it's just like, interesting things pop up, and it's really funny when the Horde

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
shows up.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
It's like, because they got, like, a 60, like, what is it, a 70 level Horde came in the other

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
day, and like, there was like a billion people on that, on the server, and they all ganged

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
up on the Horde, and the Horde's sitting there like, ah, I killed everything, we killed

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
the Horde.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
I love the Horde, I love the Horde.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I have actually a lot of Horde characters.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
That's good.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.160
It's just really funny when they show up, because I think they're all, the one, someone

21:01.160 --> 21:05.480
explained to me, the Alliance is a bunch of noobs, who don't know, like, children who

21:05.480 --> 21:09.000
don't know anything, and the Horde is a bunch of assholes.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Yeah, so I'm on the Horde side, definitely.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Yeah, of course.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I've got both, but.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Well, now that they have blood elves, you're starting to see a lot of the noob-ness on

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
the Horde side.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.840
The blood elf males are the only ones that I can stand, because they're not all butch.

21:19.840 --> 21:20.840
Well, they're very gay.

21:20.840 --> 21:21.840
I know, I love them.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.880
They're so, it's like, can I help you?

21:25.880 --> 21:30.000
I'm looking, and Uni is jumping up and down, going, ooh, it's slash one, type slash one.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Thank you.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Uni's being very helpful.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Thank you.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
She's noob-friendly.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.600
Some people come up to me, you know what, that game is the most, WoW is the most frustrating

21:40.600 --> 21:44.240
fucking game in the world, because there are people walking around you, and I'm not used

21:44.240 --> 21:45.240
to that.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.240
I'm not used to MMOs.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.240
I've never played them.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.320
And so, somebody comes up to me, do you want to duel?

21:49.320 --> 21:50.320
No, thank you, decline.

21:50.320 --> 21:55.120
Five seconds later, do you want to duel by the same frickin' person over and over and

21:55.120 --> 21:56.120
over again?

21:56.120 --> 22:01.000
I had to tell this guy, leave me the fuck alone, I'm on a quest, I have to get the candles.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.240
Or what was Irene's story from, I think she told it on the air last week, she said something

22:04.240 --> 22:10.380
about make wool, or something, and the guy traded the wool, and was like, no, I don't

22:10.380 --> 22:11.580
do cloth guarding.

22:11.580 --> 22:15.000
Back me wool, please.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.880
Which totally didn't speak English, it was great.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.120
So now her character is actually named back me wool.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.120
Back me wool.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.120
It's awesome.

22:22.120 --> 22:26.320
So when you guys all come into Ravencrest to play on the official server of Orzammar

22:26.320 --> 22:29.000
I'm going to get back and play, Aerie Peak, hi.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.160
Oh no, we all band in Aerie Peak.

22:31.160 --> 22:35.680
Aerie Peak, the problem with Aerie Peak, it's the first one on the list alphabetically.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.400
Oops, none of us ever thought of that, so Aerie Peak went downhill real quick.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
Ooh.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.400
You can pay for my account and I'll play again.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
Pay for your account, Jamie.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.400
No, set up a PayPal.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.400
I'll pay for your account.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.400
Don't give me that look!

22:45.400 --> 22:52.080
God, she gives me that look every time I offer to pay for something, shut up!

22:52.080 --> 22:53.560
We'll talk about it after the show.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.560
Okay.

22:54.560 --> 22:55.560
Oh, I got that look.

22:55.560 --> 22:56.560
I'm gonna get that look.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.560
All you need to do is some sweet lovin'.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.680
So I'm gonna go on break right now, hey guys, let's go in here, there's two of us.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.680
Yeah, we'll be right back, guys.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.680
Wow, wow.

23:04.680 --> 23:05.680
All right.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.680
They're fighting.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.520
This is the hottest episode of Orange Lounge ever.

23:09.520 --> 23:16.040
I can't believe we're offering to eat pussy over World of Warcraft.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.720
Girls are gonna eat each other out over World of Warcraft.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.520
Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.520
Name one other place on the internet you will ever find this.

23:24.520 --> 23:29.720
Hey, to quote Randall, I love the cock.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.480
I just had to defend myself here.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.480
All right.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.480
Oh, sorry.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.480
All right.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.480
Cock-loving Marissa.

23:35.480 --> 23:40.960
Wait, wait, wait, how many of us have shoes off?

23:40.960 --> 23:41.960
I have my shoes off.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.960
My half-Japanese boyfriend would kick my ass.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.040
If Marissa takes off her shoes, then it's Mississippi orgy.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.040
Mississippi orgy!

23:48.040 --> 23:49.040
All right.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.040
Woo!

23:50.040 --> 23:51.400
Explain the Mississippi orgy thing again for anybody who's new.

23:51.400 --> 23:57.200
State law in Mississippi is that if three or more people, and at least one of them is,

23:57.200 --> 24:02.720
I think, no, it's three more people with one person of an opposite gender in the room,

24:02.720 --> 24:04.440
it's an orgy.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.440
With your socks and shoes off.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.440
Or with your shoes off.

24:06.440 --> 24:07.440
I'm sorry.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.440
There you go.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.880
We are having a Mississippi orgy on Orange Lounge radio.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.600
Jeremy Todd 1 says, I disagree, Rob.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.800
The episode with the Mississippi orgy was the hottest episode ever.

24:15.800 --> 24:16.800
Well, here you go.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.440
That's why I told Marissa to take off her shoes.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.760
Return of the Mississippi orgy.

24:19.760 --> 24:23.680
Now we need some shine and we're set.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.680
Marissa, I know you're not the biggest gamer in the world, but has there been anything

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
you've been playing lately?

24:27.680 --> 24:33.000
Actually, I bought my first gaming system ever because I was just so obsessed with reliving

24:33.000 --> 24:36.880
the adventure games with ScummVM that I actually finally went out and I bought a DS.

24:36.880 --> 24:41.000
I'd like to personally thank Nintendo, I swear to God, for bringing women back into gaming

24:41.000 --> 24:44.320
because every chick I know is so excited about the Wii.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.880
So yeah, that's the first gaming system where I actually went, ooh, I want it.

24:47.880 --> 24:52.780
You know, this is a very profound thing we're talking about here because from our perspective

24:52.780 --> 24:57.780
as hardcore gamers, you're always reading on the game blogs about Nintendo's trying

24:57.780 --> 24:59.920
to get the casual gamers back into gaming.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.160
How can we get the casual gamers back into gaming?

25:02.160 --> 25:06.440
So I ask you, you're saying the DS is the first system you have ever bought with your

25:06.440 --> 25:08.480
own money.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.480
What made you do it?

25:09.480 --> 25:12.520
Well, I've always been broke so that has something to do with the fact that I didn't have one

25:12.520 --> 25:13.520
before.

25:13.520 --> 25:21.680
Quite frankly, PC gaming isn't the equivalent to a game system.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.960
She wants Link's ass.

25:22.960 --> 25:23.960
What?

25:23.960 --> 25:26.320
She wants Link's ass.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.920
The Rob D says, every chick I know is excited about the Wii.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
I know, every chick.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.360
Oh, the gaming system, never mind.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.360
Get it?

25:34.360 --> 25:40.680
Uh-huh, uh-huh, give me that.

25:40.680 --> 25:45.240
The DS just offered something completely new as far as the touchscreen interface and you

25:45.240 --> 25:50.760
could play Game Boy Advance, which was cool, you know, double deal.

25:50.760 --> 25:51.760
And it's accessible.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.920
I mean, it really is for people like me who are kind of dyslexic and all the buttons and

25:55.920 --> 25:57.720
the functions, et cetera.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.280
You know, and that's what they say.

25:59.280 --> 26:03.940
Is it the fact that you look at an Xbox 360 controller and you're like, too many buttons.

26:03.940 --> 26:04.940
What the fuck is that?

26:04.940 --> 26:06.940
That's a spaceship.

26:06.940 --> 26:12.840
Well, the original controller was a fucking spaceship for the original Xbox, that is.

26:12.840 --> 26:18.800
But yeah, I mean, I think it could potentially get people into gaming again because it seems

26:18.800 --> 26:23.400
like there isn't a single, I mean, I'm sure that there can be some recommendations, but

26:23.400 --> 26:27.760
there aren't a lot of mainstream ways to just completely reintroduce somebody into gaming

26:27.760 --> 26:33.320
who's used to the, you know, classic Nintendo, ah, God bless it, you know, two-button interface.

26:33.320 --> 26:39.120
So I think that the Wii is a great, you know, I think they ultimately could become more

26:39.120 --> 26:42.920
successful with more complicated gaming, et cetera.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.640
But Cooking Mama is fun.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.440
Oh, God, not another one.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.440
Cooking Mama.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.440
Oh, God.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.440
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.960
I actually, I'm burnt out on it though, I will admit.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.920
I went off the show.

26:52.920 --> 26:59.440
A very special listener sent me pictures of Mama cosplay, which you'll hear about later.

26:59.440 --> 27:02.560
Can I tell the Mama cosplayer, go outside, please?

27:02.560 --> 27:06.120
It's on my phone, I'll show you, the Mama cosplayer was great.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.760
You also need to go outside.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.120
You know what, you need to bite my ass, but to quote Chris in a non-literal sense.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.600
I do have to complain though, and this is really old school gaming, but my friend told

27:14.600 --> 27:19.840
me to try to get into RPGs to try Morrowind, and I bought a video game to play, not to

27:19.840 --> 27:25.080
read, not to walk every fucking where, I just had to say that.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.280
However, here's a really awesome picture of me in a hat.

27:27.280 --> 27:32.080
Have you ever, actually speaking of Morrowind, have you ever played Elder Scrolls Oblivion,

27:32.080 --> 27:33.080
ever?

27:33.080 --> 27:36.320
Like, it's kind of an adventure game, it's pretty as hell, off the show to you some day.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.320
No, I haven't.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.320
It's very pretty.

27:38.320 --> 27:39.320
It's fun.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.960
Well, I don't have an Xbox, but Chris has an Xbox, yes.

27:41.960 --> 27:42.960
It's for 360.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.200
He plays black all the time.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.720
Wow, who's doing that cosplay, do we know?

27:48.720 --> 27:49.720
That's funny.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.720
It's some convention.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.720
That's great.

27:51.720 --> 27:52.720
See someone calling Mama.

27:52.720 --> 27:58.720
Oh, is that something Mama sent you from the, oh, my bad, am I not supposed to spoil?

27:58.720 --> 27:59.720
For the record.

27:59.720 --> 28:03.480
I love that look, Jamie.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.480
Stop pouting.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.480
Bad Rob.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.480
So cute.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.480
Bad Rob.

28:07.480 --> 28:11.280
All right, then let's keep the show moving so we can get to some news and whatever it

28:11.280 --> 28:12.280
is.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.280
I'll show you movement.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.280
All right.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.280
Bowel movement.

28:15.280 --> 28:19.480
All right, anyhow, let's get to some gaming news, thankfully, oh, God, yes, we need some

28:19.480 --> 28:21.560
gaming news here on this program.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.560
So who's going to start us off tonight?

28:22.560 --> 28:25.560
Oh, I know, we actually talk about games once in a while.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.520
In fact, get this, you know what, Chris, we actually get some exclusives.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.560
Those are like things you haven't heard anywhere else yet.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.920
Oh, my God, really?

28:32.920 --> 28:33.920
Exactly.

28:33.920 --> 28:34.920
So, Loki.

28:34.920 --> 28:35.920
That's amazing.

28:35.920 --> 28:36.920
Loki's going to tell us.

28:36.920 --> 28:37.920
She sounds like she's coming.

28:37.920 --> 28:38.920
Never mind.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.360
Why don't you all go back to whatever you were doing before?

28:41.360 --> 28:43.280
Just, all right.

28:43.280 --> 28:48.840
Anyways, so like last week how we had some exclusive dates for the Microsoft games, today

28:48.840 --> 28:51.840
we come with a brand new company, Midway.

28:51.840 --> 28:56.520
We have a whole lineup for their games and the core subject of the change, you know,

28:56.520 --> 29:01.120
like a certain Halo 3 date, you know, which I still believe that that game.

29:01.120 --> 29:06.280
Oh, yes, I forgot to mention the Halo 3 official teaser came out this week and there it is

29:06.280 --> 29:08.780
right there, Fall 2007.

29:08.780 --> 29:12.560
And Loki had said on this show previously, what, April or May or something?

29:12.560 --> 29:13.560
May, but...

29:13.560 --> 29:14.560
Wrong.

29:14.560 --> 29:18.160
Well, here's why, okay, and I have a couple reasons why I think they're doing this.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.680
One, it's a big Christmas, you know, they don't have a big Christmas game coming out.

29:21.680 --> 29:25.920
Two, I think they thought that the PlayStation 3 was going to be in a better position to,

29:25.920 --> 29:27.800
you know, where there might actually be a threat.

29:27.800 --> 29:32.200
You know, right now I don't see PlayStation 3s flying off the shelves and they certainly

29:32.200 --> 29:36.520
don't have the lineup for it, so, you know, you don't need to put the game out right now.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.200
And to be honest, I think the game will probably be done by May, but they'll just hold it until

29:40.200 --> 29:43.140
Christmas, you know, so they can capitalize on that stuff.

29:43.140 --> 29:46.800
So lesson learned about the distribution dates, I mean, we've said it before, this isn't anything

29:46.800 --> 29:49.800
we didn't tell you when we said the Halo 3 date the first time, dates are subject to

29:49.800 --> 29:50.800
change.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.520
Retailers push things back all the time, you read about this on blogs, so we can tell you

29:53.520 --> 29:57.640
how things are now, but unforeseen circumstances will push games back.

29:57.640 --> 30:02.920
One perfect example of this would be Stranglehold for PlayStation 3 and the 360.

30:02.920 --> 30:06.440
Originally that was scheduled to be out, what, December of last year, and now it's pushed

30:06.440 --> 30:11.120
all the way, it's my birthday by the way, September 11th, and it'll be also available

30:11.120 --> 30:15.560
in the collector's edition, which is, it looks like a pretty cool game, you know, John Woo

30:15.560 --> 30:17.360
and stuff.

30:17.360 --> 30:23.040
Anyways, Mortal Kombat Armageddon for the Wii is scheduled to come out April 18th, and

30:23.040 --> 30:26.240
that looks actually pretty fun.

30:26.240 --> 30:32.480
Also we'll be getting Hour of Victory on the Xbox 360, yet another World War II first person

30:32.480 --> 30:34.280
shooter.

30:34.280 --> 30:40.200
Also Blacksite Area 51, also scheduled for September, September 12th on PlayStation 3

30:40.200 --> 30:41.540
and 360.

30:41.540 --> 30:47.040
Also in September, Unreal Tournament 3 on the 360, that's the 19th.

30:47.040 --> 30:55.840
And then Mortal Kombat's coming out on the DS on October 17th, why?

30:55.840 --> 31:00.920
I mean has there ever been a good handheld Mortal Kombat, ever, ever?

31:00.920 --> 31:03.080
If you have a Nomad.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.080
Okay I don't.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.480
Well, a Nomad's just a Genesis.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.480
But you said handheld.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.480
That's cheating.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.480
No it's not.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.480
You cheated.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.680
You're a cheating cheater.

31:11.680 --> 31:17.000
Also scheduled the same date, Wheelman, on PlayStation 3 and 360, that brand new Vin Diesel

31:17.000 --> 31:20.380
movie slash game, that's going to be coming out.

31:20.380 --> 31:23.120
Some other interesting stuff from Nintendo, they're going to have the official Nintendo

31:23.120 --> 31:28.560
headset for the DS coming out April 22nd, and a couple delays, well actually one delay

31:28.560 --> 31:33.720
here for you, MLB 07, the show for the PlayStation 3 has been delayed to April 24th.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.720
So yay.

31:34.720 --> 31:35.720
Lots of dates.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.720
All right, well thank you very much for those dates.

31:38.720 --> 31:43.060
Looking at the chatroom, Fireboma says Mortal Kombat better be Wi-Fi.

31:43.060 --> 31:44.060
Maybe that's the reason to have it on DS.

31:44.060 --> 31:46.060
Actually, Tekken Dark Resurrection, that's a good point.

31:46.060 --> 31:47.060
Who said that?

31:47.060 --> 31:48.060
That is a good point.

31:48.060 --> 31:49.060
There was also...

31:49.060 --> 31:50.060
Alpha Canagram.

31:50.060 --> 31:51.060
Good job.

31:51.060 --> 31:55.040
Mortal Kombat Deception's Unchained on the PSP that came out in November.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.680
All right, so I think back to those crappy Game Boy ones.

31:58.680 --> 31:59.680
Come on.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.680
Surely you played...

32:00.680 --> 32:02.960
Like they had characters cut out of them, and they were bad.

32:02.960 --> 32:03.960
Oh, Game Boy.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.640
I mean, come on, you can't really play a game with like two buttons anyway.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.640
Why bother?

32:07.640 --> 32:11.720
At least with the DS, you've got six buttons, so you can at least do kind of what you had

32:11.720 --> 32:14.360
on the Super Nintendo, at the very least.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.800
All right.

32:15.800 --> 32:20.680
Well, speaking of things that are announced, this time in the arcade, we don't talk about

32:20.680 --> 32:24.660
the arcade scene an awful lot, but obviously, if you know the history of Orange Lounge Radio,

32:24.660 --> 32:29.280
we started as a station for the first few years we were doing this, we were strictly

32:29.280 --> 32:32.520
about music games and what was going on with the music-based games.

32:32.520 --> 32:36.200
So of course, Dance Dance Revolution is a game we've loved for a long time.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.760
That's how we all met, actually, was through DDR.

32:38.760 --> 32:45.040
So with great pleasure, we can talk about DDR Supernova 2, which was officially announced

32:45.040 --> 32:47.560
at AOU 2007.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.720
Of course, DDR kind of came back after a little slumber.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.980
DDR hibernated for a little while and came back with Supernova last year.

32:53.980 --> 32:59.700
And now, that's all you have, though, is there was a little teaser poster that just said

32:59.700 --> 33:02.120
Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.120
That's really all we know.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.840
It's coming, but that's a good sign.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.880
Are you surprised?

33:08.880 --> 33:11.240
For me, yes, because it's arcade.

33:11.240 --> 33:14.880
If this was a home version, no, that's not a surprise at all.

33:14.880 --> 33:18.920
But as far as a arcade release goes, yeah, I think it is a little bit of a surprise.

33:18.920 --> 33:23.360
Because of the fact that DDR took such a long break, I think to get a new game announced

33:23.360 --> 33:27.840
so quickly, despite the rumors of the 200, 300 song expansion, whatever it is, which

33:27.840 --> 33:31.360
is probably this, I think it's great.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.320
I wonder what that says, because I can't read Japanese, obviously.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.960
So it says 2000, I wonder if it's like spring, fall, summer.

33:37.960 --> 33:43.200
Let me give it a look, but I will do that after I deliver some other news to us.

33:43.200 --> 33:50.840
Why the hell does this look like, I want to say, like some crappy Pokemon logo or something?

33:50.840 --> 33:52.840
Where's the damn poster?

33:52.840 --> 33:56.440
Because Pokemon's very lame.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.840
Chris has problems with you calling Pokemon lame.

33:58.840 --> 34:04.360
And Pokemon is the only game that I really, truly loved first.

34:04.360 --> 34:08.320
You know, DDR Supernova 2, I think it's going to be a Jewish game, if you notice there's

34:08.320 --> 34:11.000
like almost like a Star of David in the background there.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Wow.

34:12.000 --> 34:18.080
You know, our resident Jew in the room has made a face in regards to that.

34:18.080 --> 34:32.320
Actually, Loki's married to a Jew too, so he gets to make the jokes through proxy.

34:32.320 --> 34:37.840
He's into Judaism, if you know what I mean.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.160
Marissa's boyfriend is half Japanese with a very Japanese mother, so she gets to make

34:41.160 --> 34:44.080
all the Japanese jokes, so she's okay by proxy too.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.080
There you go, alright.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.080
Good.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.840
Do I get to make Jewish jokes because I know you?

34:48.840 --> 34:50.680
But I am!

34:50.680 --> 34:51.680
Dammit.

34:51.680 --> 35:02.720
Okay, I do believe that that says, looking at that, that is, I want to say winter.

35:02.720 --> 35:06.840
I'm pretty sure that that's the kanji for 2007 winter.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.800
Kyle Snyder's in chat, who's somewhat of a well-known DDR persona.

35:09.800 --> 35:10.800
Hi Kyle!

35:10.800 --> 35:13.280
And he thinks the following will show up in Supernova 2.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.320
These are the official Kyle Snyder predictions.

35:15.320 --> 35:21.400
Fly Away remix, Stargate Heaven, Future Love mix, Flow, Jem and Reggae mix, VJ Army, G2

35:21.400 --> 35:22.640
and Outer Limits.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.880
I wouldn't mind if VJ Army showed up.

35:24.880 --> 35:25.880
That would be rad.

35:25.880 --> 35:26.880
Alright.

35:26.880 --> 35:32.880
Well, you know what else is absolutely completely 100% rad and even more super cool than DDR?

35:32.880 --> 35:33.880
Me.

35:33.880 --> 35:34.880
Me!

35:34.880 --> 35:35.880
Your mom is cooler than DDR.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.640
Which is true because I like your mom.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.640
Your mom's really cool.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.640
Okay.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.360
But not in a, not in a, you know.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.360
Not in a homosexual way.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.360
Not in a MILF way.

35:44.360 --> 35:45.360
Okay.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.360
Alright.

35:46.360 --> 35:51.280
Um, but Silent Hill is coming to the arcade, and yes, I know, everybody already knows about

35:51.280 --> 35:54.040
it, so shut up.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.040
There is...

35:55.040 --> 35:59.160
Orange Lounge Radio reporting the news you already know about.

35:59.160 --> 36:06.040
There is a Silent Hill in development for the arcade, not really major too much about

36:06.040 --> 36:10.360
it out, it's just called Silent Hill the Arcade, supposed to be a gun game with a big curtain

36:10.360 --> 36:11.360
around it and...

36:11.360 --> 36:12.360
That's like a lasso.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.360
Ooh, Pyramid Head.

36:14.360 --> 36:17.960
But, um, it looks really blurry.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.600
Well, I'm thinking it's just going for the look of Silent Hill, like it's probably going

36:21.600 --> 36:23.760
to be foggy and have that whole ambience to it.

36:23.760 --> 36:27.400
I'm sorry, the PlayStation 2 looked better than that.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.140
That curtain's gotta go.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.140
That curtain isn't gonna last.

36:31.140 --> 36:32.140
That curtain that's on the thing, though, yeah.

36:32.140 --> 36:35.960
Little kids at Golf Land will rip that shit off in five seconds.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.920
My whole fear regarding this, though, is that it's gonna turn and it's gonna be like House

36:39.920 --> 36:44.360
of the Dead clone, and it better not be, or I will personally go to Konami of Japan with

36:44.360 --> 36:45.520
a tank.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.440
I will tape that.

36:47.440 --> 36:52.080
If Akira Yomoka has anything to do with this, I'm okay with it, because I know I respect

36:52.080 --> 36:53.080
that man so much.

36:53.080 --> 36:56.960
If it's really cool, I will personally, I mean, hug him.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.640
Mercy, are you a big Silent Hill fan?

36:59.640 --> 37:02.640
I'm sorry, Chris, we were not making it up to you.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.240
I don't go see a lot of movies, not because I'm a hermit, because I don't like paying

37:06.240 --> 37:08.240
eight dollars and seeing a movie that sucks.

37:08.240 --> 37:11.240
I drive my feet, stick to the floor, and the smell of vomit or whatever else goes on in

37:11.240 --> 37:13.600
the theater.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.600
So I haven't seen a lot of movies.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.040
Do you like scary games?

37:17.040 --> 37:18.800
You ever thought about playing a scary video game?

37:18.800 --> 37:22.760
I was the best girlfriend in the world when I bought my boyfriend, who couldn't afford

37:22.760 --> 37:23.760
anything.

37:23.760 --> 37:30.040
I bought him a, neither could I, technically, I bought him a GameCube, and god damn it,

37:30.040 --> 37:32.040
I'm having an eternal darkness.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.040
Resident Evil 4.

37:33.040 --> 37:39.640
I bought him Resident Evil for the GameCube, and he just had a heart attack.

37:39.640 --> 37:45.280
I like the suspenseful games, but sometimes they can just piss you off, and make you want

37:45.280 --> 37:47.320
to kill something, like in the game.

37:47.320 --> 37:48.320
Trauma Sender!

37:48.320 --> 37:50.200
Trauma Sender is amazing!

37:50.200 --> 37:53.000
Trauma Sender makes me want to kill things.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Oh!

37:54.000 --> 37:56.160
Stab your knife into the patient.

37:56.160 --> 37:59.320
I love, that's my favorite thing to do when I get frustrated in Trauma Centers, I just

37:59.320 --> 38:02.600
whip out the scalpel and go, just start stabbing the patient.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.600
Just start trying to kill the patient.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.600
Exactly.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.520
You know what I like to do in Trauma Center now that I'm in school to be a massage therapist?

38:07.520 --> 38:09.120
Let's begin the operation!

38:09.120 --> 38:12.840
I like tracing out their muscles, because I know where they are now.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.880
Blaze says Trauma Center equals love.

38:14.880 --> 38:19.400
By the way, just because I'm proud of myself, I made a 92 on my anatomy test.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.400
Yay!

38:20.400 --> 38:21.400
Back to games.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.400
Can I get a technical geek on?

38:22.400 --> 38:23.400
Can I get a technical geek on?

38:23.400 --> 38:24.400
Is that a SM58?

38:24.400 --> 38:25.400
I have no idea.

38:25.400 --> 38:32.400
So now I totally know how to relax the piriformis when you have sciatic pain.

38:32.400 --> 38:39.480
Speaking of Silent Hill, when does this come out?

38:39.480 --> 38:44.480
I did know, and then I closed the article.

38:44.480 --> 38:45.480
Let me down.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.480
No!

38:46.480 --> 38:50.000
No, they don't actually say.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.480
I just hope the curtain was just to protect the press at this arcade show, because that

38:54.480 --> 38:55.480
curtain is so old.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.280
It would only be in America that the curtain would be in any game.

38:57.280 --> 39:02.760
The curtain was basically to give it a dark, eerie feeling.

39:02.760 --> 39:06.000
The curtain gives you the feeling of playing it in a hefty bag.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
That's what the curtain gives you the feeling of.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.520
If they want to really make it a thing, they should do it like how that crap-tastic Jurassic

39:13.520 --> 39:22.280
Park game is, where you can sit down.

39:22.280 --> 39:30.240
If they come out with the typing of the Silent Hill, I will retire from video game everything,

39:30.240 --> 39:34.120
because everything I need in the world has been done.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.760
I still play Typing of the Dead.

39:36.760 --> 39:40.400
What if it were like Guitar Freaks crossed with Silent Hill?

39:40.400 --> 39:41.400
That's stupid.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.800
It would be Ki-Tar that you read.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.240
Pyramid Head rocks out.

39:46.240 --> 39:50.680
You have to fight them with the power of rock.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.400
That's Guitaro Man gone lame.

39:52.400 --> 39:58.720
No, we should have Silent Ki-Tar.

39:58.720 --> 39:59.720
Cassio the Shooting!

39:59.720 --> 40:04.560
You can kill them with Hall and Oates, okay?

40:04.560 --> 40:07.600
You can kill anyone with Hall and Oates.

40:07.600 --> 40:13.360
Speaking of slightly lame, let's talk about Tekken 6.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.880
Yes, Tekken 6 is slightly lame.

40:15.880 --> 40:16.880
Why?

40:16.880 --> 40:20.200
Because the screenshots in the trailer that they've shown of it look kind of lame.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.920
And not even really up to par to Virtua Fighter 5.

40:23.920 --> 40:27.920
But nonetheless, we'll be coming to arcades soon.

40:27.920 --> 40:32.680
And we'll be featuring also two new characters, Leo and Zafina.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.760
Both of which look very generic.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.480
So hooray.

40:37.480 --> 40:43.600
But it looks like it will have the same visual quality of Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.600
And um...

40:44.600 --> 40:48.700
Okay, wait, what were the characters' names again, Leo?

40:48.700 --> 40:49.700
Leo and Zafina.

40:49.700 --> 40:52.040
Okay, now keep in mind I've never seen pictures of these characters.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.400
I don't even know if they've leaked out.

40:53.400 --> 40:56.280
But I'm going to make some bold predictions, okay, knowing the Tekken series.

40:56.280 --> 41:00.280
I'm going to say Leo is shirtless.

41:00.280 --> 41:10.840
And Zafina has humongous breasts that will bounce.

41:10.840 --> 41:13.000
You're wrong about shirtless.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.560
Every character in Tekken is shirtless.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.280
Even one of the chicks, I think.

41:20.280 --> 41:25.400
Leo looks like a chick, who also looks like someone that was ripped from Final Fantasy

41:25.400 --> 41:26.400
X.

41:26.400 --> 41:30.080
No, Leo looks like one of the Bogards, a little bit.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.600
Okay, Leo looks like a chick, anyways.

41:32.600 --> 41:33.600
And then...

41:33.600 --> 41:35.200
That's a guy.

41:35.200 --> 41:44.680
And then Zafina, well, she's your chick that's, you know, of course she has big boobs, but...

41:44.680 --> 41:45.680
She's your...

41:45.680 --> 41:46.680
You ain't bad.

41:46.680 --> 41:47.680
Your ethnic chick.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.680
What, is she a belly dancer?

41:48.680 --> 41:49.680
What the hell is that?

41:49.680 --> 41:50.680
Probably.

41:50.680 --> 41:51.680
Your belly...

41:51.680 --> 41:52.680
That's so wrong.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.680
I don't know.

41:53.680 --> 41:54.680
Oh well, easy access, I suppose.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.800
Either way, it looks kind of neat.

41:56.800 --> 42:00.440
They're going to have, it looks like from the trailer, they're going to have different

42:00.440 --> 42:03.360
ways you can kind of build up your characters and stuff.

42:03.360 --> 42:07.780
I don't know, it looks okay, but really, do you really need to push better graphics with

42:07.780 --> 42:08.780
fighting games?

42:08.780 --> 42:09.780
Just make it fun.

42:09.780 --> 42:10.780
Yay.

42:10.780 --> 42:11.780
Yay for that, actually.

42:11.780 --> 42:13.720
Marisa says she's yay for that.

42:13.720 --> 42:14.720
Alright.

42:14.720 --> 42:20.440
So they do need to push more boob physics with Dead or Alive 3, or Dead or Alive 5,

42:20.440 --> 42:21.440
I guess that would be.

42:21.440 --> 42:25.920
Jamie, you're a Tekken fangirl, are you excited about Tekken 6, or is this a little too much

42:25.920 --> 42:27.440
of one thing, or what?

42:27.440 --> 42:31.560
I'm always excited over anything that has Jin in it.

42:31.560 --> 42:34.320
Yeah, I was going to say, as long as Jin's in it, right?

42:34.320 --> 42:35.880
And Asuka now, because Asuka's kind of...

42:35.880 --> 42:40.440
Well here, I'm going to write a letter on Jamie's behalf to Namco.

42:40.440 --> 42:43.440
Dear Namco...

42:43.440 --> 42:44.440
May I?

42:44.440 --> 42:45.440
May I?

42:45.440 --> 42:46.440
May I?

42:46.440 --> 42:47.440
May I?

42:47.440 --> 42:48.440
Sit down.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.440
Shut up.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.440
Let me speak.

42:50.440 --> 42:51.440
Okay, here we go.

42:51.440 --> 42:52.440
Rob, you talk too much.

42:52.440 --> 42:53.440
I know.

42:53.440 --> 42:54.440
Even our fans think so too.

42:54.440 --> 42:55.440
No, I know.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.440
It's funny.

42:56.440 --> 42:57.440
Okay, then here's my letter.

42:57.440 --> 42:58.440
Dear fans, suck it.

42:58.440 --> 42:59.440
Alright, here we go, back to Jamie's letter.

42:59.440 --> 43:00.440
No, no, that's G4.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.440
Dear Namco Bandai.

43:01.440 --> 43:02.440
Jin!

43:02.440 --> 43:10.440
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

43:10.440 --> 43:11.440
No, no, no, no.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.440
Love, Jamie.

43:12.440 --> 43:13.440
No, no, no.

43:13.440 --> 43:16.440
Jin has also carried over to Asuka.

43:16.440 --> 43:17.440
P.S.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.440
Asuka!

43:18.440 --> 43:19.440
P.S.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.560
Oh my god, boobs.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.440
Mike W. says, my ears bleed.

43:24.440 --> 43:26.320
Rondo of Blood, the fighting game.

43:26.320 --> 43:29.200
Fireboma says, write it in blood.

43:29.200 --> 43:32.160
Uni says, I'm going to smack Rob for not being nice to D.S.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.160
I bite back.

43:33.160 --> 43:37.560
For the record, I'm so sick of how many shadows your game could fucking render if it still

43:37.560 --> 43:38.560
sucks.

43:38.560 --> 43:40.920
For the record.

43:40.920 --> 43:45.160
That's how we feel, but we don't know how to put it so eloquently to the developers.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.400
Would you like to write a letter to the developers of games?

43:47.400 --> 43:48.400
What if it went like that?

43:48.400 --> 43:49.400
Alright.

43:49.400 --> 43:56.260
It's like, great, now you have a really shiny, highly rendered piece of shit.

43:56.260 --> 44:02.320
That dookie looks mighty fine, I mean, I can see like, it's obvious you ate corn.

44:02.320 --> 44:10.080
It's like, wow, she looks really lifelike, too bad that she clips through people and

44:10.080 --> 44:11.080
is stuck in the stage.

44:11.080 --> 44:14.760
I love the blood elves in World of Warcraft because they levitate over bridges because

44:14.760 --> 44:18.440
the clipping is so awful.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.040
In certain places they do.

44:20.040 --> 44:24.520
Anyhow, let's talk about something very sexy.

44:24.520 --> 44:28.940
Besides me, Ikaruga is a shooter game.

44:28.940 --> 44:29.940
You know Ikaruga, right?

44:29.940 --> 44:35.560
It's like the one where you press buttons to change the color of your show because there's

44:35.560 --> 44:38.520
like red bullets and I think it was purple bullets and red bullets.

44:38.520 --> 44:42.160
It's like black and white, but the black is kind of purplish.

44:42.160 --> 44:43.160
It's so awesome.

44:43.160 --> 44:47.600
You have these bullets and you need to change the color, it's such a great shooter.

44:47.600 --> 44:51.600
What's happening is that Ikaruga is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade and the way

44:51.600 --> 44:56.520
they found this out was on an Xbox 360 debug unit through the partner net.

44:56.520 --> 44:58.800
And I think somebody a little later is going to be talking a little more about this whole

44:58.800 --> 45:05.520
partner net leak thing, but certainly Ikaruga was the highlight of the games announced for

45:05.520 --> 45:06.520
that, so that's very sexy.

45:06.520 --> 45:07.520
Ikaruga is sexy.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.520
Ikaruga is a sexy ass game.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.800
We need radiant silver guns still though.

45:10.800 --> 45:14.880
So I'm very excited about that, that'll be awesome.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.560
Ikaruga, that is just like so, well I'll tell you something else though that's relatively

45:18.560 --> 45:19.780
sexy.

45:19.780 --> 45:25.800
That is if you are a big collector like me and a SKU has shown up at GameCrazy, which

45:25.800 --> 45:31.080
I cannot confirm for my husband's GameCrazy because he hasn't seen fit to tell me, sorry,

45:31.080 --> 45:37.560
for a black Xbox 360 and it has been confirmed by several GameCrazies.

45:37.560 --> 45:43.160
Isn't this like the fourth week in a row there's been some type of black Xbox 360 story on

45:43.160 --> 45:44.160
the internet?

45:44.160 --> 45:50.200
Yes, and GamersReports.com would like to let you know that they had the story first because

45:50.200 --> 45:52.360
it's posted on every single follow up story.

45:52.360 --> 45:55.340
It's on every freaking gaming site once, look I don't give a shit about that.

45:55.340 --> 46:03.180
What I want to ask about is who cares, take a Sharpie to the Xbox 360 you have now and

46:03.180 --> 46:06.160
make it black if you care that much.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.160
Dark Soccer, why?

46:08.160 --> 46:10.320
The original Xbox was black.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.800
But we had the Halo one.

46:12.800 --> 46:17.360
Yeah but here's the thing though about it, I think it's not really a fact that it's black,

46:17.360 --> 46:20.660
it's just that it's going to have a 120 gig hard drive supposedly and they think that's

46:20.660 --> 46:23.000
also going to have an HDMI out.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.240
I can tell you right now.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.240
And a bigger penis.

46:25.240 --> 46:29.800
I can tell you right now either way it's just going to be a disappointment.

46:29.800 --> 46:33.180
That's all it's going to be is a big disappointment for you.

46:33.180 --> 46:38.200
So great they're going to announce that, they're going to announce the 512 card or memory unit

46:38.200 --> 46:42.920
or whatever and everybody's like oh yay we can download more crap.

46:42.920 --> 46:49.640
I'm sorry I just had to weigh in on this subject because I think Nintendo, it's the stupidest

46:49.640 --> 46:51.640
thing in the world but I think they made a big mistake with the GameCube.

46:51.640 --> 46:55.440
Well actually I got my X for the GameCube but they made it purple.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.840
Because guys were afraid of having a purple GameCube.

46:57.840 --> 47:00.320
Hey be glad that we didn't get the orange one.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.320
Mine was silver.

47:01.320 --> 47:05.320
It was indigo okay.

47:05.320 --> 47:08.040
It was blue and by the way I had the black ones so.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.040
In Japan they had orange ones.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.040
That makes you extra hetero.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.040
Okay the black ones.

47:11.040 --> 47:15.400
Tigerclaw says Sky you know that old saying once you go black you never go back.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.560
Is that true Dark Soccer?

47:16.560 --> 47:19.000
Is that why you need the black Xbox 360 so bad?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.960
I want it to match my Saturn.

47:21.960 --> 47:22.960
Among other things.

47:22.960 --> 47:27.280
Here's the thing though about you're going to get this nice fancy black Xbox 360 and

47:27.280 --> 47:35.000
then oh wait the controllers are white, the Xbox HD DVD player is white, oh wait the remote

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
is white.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Hmm that sucks.

47:37.000 --> 47:42.920
I really don't give two shits, maybe half of one but you know it's for people who say

47:42.920 --> 47:50.440
oh wait you know fine you've got a new one but whatever and for the record the Sega Saturn

47:50.440 --> 47:53.560
did initially come out in white in Japan.

47:53.560 --> 47:54.560
Do we really need.

47:54.560 --> 47:55.560
Check your sources.

47:55.560 --> 48:00.040
James Patrick asked in chat Dark Soccer should sell the halo one they're worth a bit of money

48:00.040 --> 48:01.040
now.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.040
Um the fuck I will.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.960
Yeah I know I have a halo one as well.

48:04.960 --> 48:05.960
Why would I sell it?

48:05.960 --> 48:07.680
What would I play my Xbox games on?

48:07.680 --> 48:13.960
Keep in mind if I sell my Xbox that drops me down to 42 video game systems.

48:13.960 --> 48:15.800
I have an orange one.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.800
But 42 is the answer to everything.

48:17.800 --> 48:23.240
Gaming Nerd says I'd love a nice pink 360 to match my pink PS2.

48:23.240 --> 48:26.200
In related news Gaming Nerd is my favorite chatter ever.

48:26.200 --> 48:36.040
Actually when I replace my JPS2 I'm going to get the Sakura PS2 which is sort of a purpley

48:36.040 --> 48:37.040
color.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.040
Purpley.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.920
And it's the Sakura one so it's mine.

48:41.920 --> 48:42.920
Mine.

48:42.920 --> 48:43.920
Anyways.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.640
I do I have my own brand of condoms.

48:45.640 --> 48:47.840
Speaking of partnering that a little bit.

48:47.840 --> 48:48.840
What?

48:48.840 --> 48:51.200
Well did she say that in a mic?

48:51.200 --> 48:52.880
Yes I did.

48:52.880 --> 48:56.800
Okay you know you know that okay I gotta tell you this this is totally off the subject but

48:56.800 --> 49:01.960
I gotta say okay I think over at All Games Interactive you know our buddy show our sister

49:01.960 --> 49:06.560
I think Scott likes to tease you a little bit on that show because he'll yell out random

49:06.560 --> 49:12.480
things like I like blueberry muffins and then he'll say he's just impersonating dark sakura

49:12.480 --> 49:15.280
and now I totally see where that comes from.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.800
I have my own brand of condoms.

49:17.800 --> 49:18.800
What?

49:18.800 --> 49:23.600
No pass the mic to Chris.

49:23.600 --> 49:27.760
Jamie and I when we hang out we go down to Japan town and we go to Ichiban-Kon.

49:27.760 --> 49:28.760
Ichiban-Kon.

49:28.760 --> 49:29.760
Ichiban-Kon thank you.

49:29.760 --> 49:33.800
And they've got a bunch of imports from Japan and one time we found Sakura condoms.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.920
I'm like Jamie look your condoms.

49:35.920 --> 49:39.240
And Chris said that and I repeated what she said only I had the mic in my hand.

49:39.240 --> 49:40.240
Yeah see.

49:40.240 --> 49:41.720
So that wasn't random you just weren't paying attention.

49:41.720 --> 49:42.720
I was.

49:42.720 --> 49:43.720
Bad host.

49:43.720 --> 49:44.720
Hold on.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.720
Bad host.

49:45.720 --> 49:46.720
Whatever.

49:46.720 --> 49:47.720
Whatever.

49:47.720 --> 49:48.720
Those are Sakura brand those are not dark sakura.

49:48.720 --> 49:49.720
It's one third your show too.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.840
But they were in a dark box.

49:51.840 --> 49:52.840
That does not count.

49:52.840 --> 49:53.840
Yes it does.

49:53.840 --> 49:59.560
That's just like saying okay that would be just like saying oh the Whitman chocolates

49:59.560 --> 50:03.520
out there oh they must be my brand chocolates because it's very close to my last name white

50:03.520 --> 50:04.520
man.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.040
You can go outside and look up.

50:06.040 --> 50:09.720
It's me Skye.

50:09.720 --> 50:10.720
You could do that.

50:10.720 --> 50:11.720
Any.

50:11.720 --> 50:12.720
Anyways.

50:12.720 --> 50:16.040
I think that also put you in the category of I invented the internet.

50:16.040 --> 50:19.640
By the way I am everywhere.

50:19.640 --> 50:20.640
Sorry Loki you had something to say.

50:20.640 --> 50:21.640
Are you finished?

50:21.640 --> 50:22.640
Are you finished?

50:22.640 --> 50:23.640
Yes we're finished.

50:23.640 --> 50:24.640
Thank you.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.640
So let's talk about partner net.

50:25.640 --> 50:29.760
Partner net's been around forever and then I guess just everybody forgot their NDA's

50:29.760 --> 50:34.280
regarding partner net because you do not talk about partner net that's first rule of partner

50:34.280 --> 50:35.280
net.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.280
Yeah right.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.280
Yeah right.

50:37.280 --> 50:43.000
Everyone I know who's ever had partner net which isn't us because we're not cool enough

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
they they they blab partner net.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.480
I mean we we're we know enough that you don't post it on blogs and things but oh god.

50:49.480 --> 50:51.880
People who have partner net don't show up.

50:51.880 --> 50:52.880
Anyways so.

50:52.880 --> 50:53.880
They think they're special.

50:53.880 --> 50:58.000
So yeah it they found someone took some video of it and they found out about more pic or

50:58.000 --> 50:59.880
more games coming out.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.400
None of which I'm too surprised about.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.120
I mean some of these have already been announced.

51:03.120 --> 51:06.920
Rare's jet pack you know game that's coming out later on they've already announced that.

51:06.920 --> 51:09.200
Juice 2007 already been announced.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.360
Absolute who the hell knows what that is.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.360
Obzpinball yay.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.360
Joe Pinball.

51:14.360 --> 51:18.720
Tetris Online which I think might actually be that Tetris Evolution or whatever that's

51:18.720 --> 51:23.360
coming out in March whatever or maybe another downloadable game.

51:23.360 --> 51:27.880
Great two different Tetrises and then some Halo 2 maps that were already announced.

51:27.880 --> 51:32.960
So yeah very exciting.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.120
Great great more stuff coming out.

51:35.120 --> 51:37.100
You know like I said you can't talk about them.

51:37.100 --> 51:41.040
Although there are other websites so I've I was reading some comments that they were

51:41.040 --> 51:45.280
posting that will actually do partner net updates on their blog but I guess they're

51:45.280 --> 51:49.800
so far under the radar that no one notices that they're doing that stuff.

51:49.800 --> 51:51.280
That's great.

51:51.280 --> 51:55.440
But yeah that's a good way to get yourself in a lot of trouble with Microsoft.

51:55.440 --> 51:58.680
You know breaking NDA like that so.

51:58.680 --> 52:03.920
Yeah apparently one of the bigger sites that had a movie got asked to take it down.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.960
Ooh snap.

52:06.960 --> 52:12.320
Anyhow something else that came down just about as fast as it went up was the Xbox rewards

52:12.320 --> 52:13.320
challenge.

52:13.320 --> 52:14.320
Remember this?

52:14.320 --> 52:18.240
You can inflate your internet penis by increasing your gamer score by fifteen hundred points

52:18.240 --> 52:22.320
and you win I don't know crappy gamer pics in a crappy game fusion frenzy in the highest

52:22.320 --> 52:23.320
level.

52:23.320 --> 52:26.040
Well everybody tried to register it once and the site just blew up.

52:26.040 --> 52:28.440
I mean nobody could get on there nobody could register.

52:28.440 --> 52:32.200
Even now that you can get on there register the site is still kind of clunky when I got

52:32.200 --> 52:35.000
on there and finally registered it was clunky.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.560
Well Xbox's little concession for this whole thing is that they have extended the Xbox

52:40.560 --> 52:42.200
reward challenge by three days.

52:42.200 --> 52:46.000
So you have three whole more days to extend your gamer score by fifty hundred points and

52:46.000 --> 52:49.660
people are bitching and complaining because they were like dude I took the day off of

52:49.660 --> 52:54.440
work so I could be the first to inflate my gamer score so I could make sure that I'm

52:54.440 --> 52:59.080
one of the ones that gets this game because you only said so many copies would be out

52:59.080 --> 53:03.760
there and I'm saying if this is you my personal opinion of you is that you need to go out

53:03.760 --> 53:08.000
and get a fucking life because seriously if you took the day off of work to stay home

53:08.000 --> 53:13.720
and increase your gamer score for this competition Microsoft does not owe you anything.

53:13.720 --> 53:17.780
Microsoft made the game Microsoft made the system that is what you bought.

53:17.780 --> 53:22.560
This whole rewards thing is like somebody giving you something for free.

53:22.560 --> 53:24.300
Microsoft did not owe you this.

53:24.300 --> 53:25.940
Why are you so mad over that?

53:25.940 --> 53:28.920
That's why I refuse to get mad about this I mean yeah it was a little frustrating as

53:28.920 --> 53:31.800
I tried to go on the site but it's like you know what it's free stuff.

53:31.800 --> 53:35.640
Quit your bitching and get like one of those diamond cards for free and then go get discounts

53:35.640 --> 53:36.640
at other places.

53:36.640 --> 53:40.800
Or go get a whore and have sex and get some of that energy out of your system because

53:40.800 --> 53:46.280
seriously if you're getting that bent out of shape over the rewards program something's

53:46.280 --> 53:49.180
wrong like a free game.

53:49.180 --> 53:50.180
The grand prize is a free game.

53:50.180 --> 53:53.960
Fusion Frenzy 2 which by the way is like one of the lamest games out there right now.

53:53.960 --> 53:56.520
I know it's not even worth it I'm sorry.

53:56.520 --> 54:01.660
So I'm like I'm sure people know that Fusion Frenzy 2 is not even worth it so I can think

54:01.660 --> 54:07.100
of no other reason why people want to do this other than to say look at my giant internet

54:07.100 --> 54:08.100
cock.

54:08.100 --> 54:13.400
I got the free game in the Microsoft contest and let me be the first to tell you it's just

54:13.400 --> 54:15.920
like you got into the Halo 3 beta.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.800
Fucking everyone got into the Halo 3 beta.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.480
Who cares?

54:20.480 --> 54:24.100
My girlfriend's cock is bigger than yours.

54:24.100 --> 54:25.100
It is.

54:25.100 --> 54:30.420
You know what though if I if I went to somebody's house and they have it on display that's not

54:30.420 --> 54:34.960
unlike well I have a friend that owns a magic card shop and they show me those player cards

54:34.960 --> 54:38.740
you know with the pictures of the expert magic player it's like a guide of who not to have

54:38.740 --> 54:40.740
sex with.

54:40.740 --> 54:45.660
I'm sorry it is.

54:45.660 --> 54:53.900
I mean I think Marissa I see Marissa speaking for like the girls who are like kind of just

54:53.900 --> 54:58.100
not really associated with video games she's like from the outside oh okay well DS is cool

54:58.100 --> 55:03.360
and you know so she comes in and sees you know a bunch of people freaking out over video

55:03.360 --> 55:06.260
games and she goes wow I'm not fucking them.

55:06.260 --> 55:10.460
Well who gives a crap if they you know they don't want to have or they're not going to

55:10.460 --> 55:12.500
get you know laid by a girl.

55:12.500 --> 55:16.740
That cuts into precious time that they could be earning more gamer score points.

55:16.740 --> 55:22.540
Okay everyone I have dated has been a nerd okay this is on the record if anyone out there

55:22.540 --> 55:29.020
knows Kaylee and SS Kaylee and a big anime music video editor so I put in my time and

55:29.020 --> 55:33.020
I'm a music nerd okay that's all I have to say about that.

55:33.020 --> 55:39.420
She's showing her creds she's literally whipping out her she's whipping out her cock and putting

55:39.420 --> 55:40.840
it on the table.

55:40.840 --> 55:45.740
I spent every day at school lunch in the library okay I have I put in my nerd time.

55:45.740 --> 55:53.620
I have put in my time all right wow all right well anyway that's that's all I have to say

55:53.620 --> 55:56.420
on the Xbox rewards program sorry for the little rant.

55:56.420 --> 56:01.420
Well you know what that's pretty shitty however speaking of Microsoft and shitty but not in

56:01.420 --> 56:07.620
a shit but okay I should say Microsoft and shitty but like not shitty.

56:07.620 --> 56:13.180
We've been discussing Forza 2 lately the release date is in May in the United States.

56:13.180 --> 56:22.240
It has been confirmed that it will be released in the UK in May this year so just to give

56:22.240 --> 56:25.180
a little bit of background on that there are going to be a lot of different cars in this

56:25.180 --> 56:35.460
there are 15 Ferraris, 2 Maseratis, 5 Lamborghinis, 13 Porsches, pretty much a lot of good stuff

56:35.460 --> 56:40.000
there's actually I'm going to have the 1987 Porsche 959 in there so that's pretty cool.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.100
So it's looking like a pretty cool racing game if you're into that sort of thing and

56:44.100 --> 56:51.340
it will again have a May release in the UK as well as in the U.S. the PAL version sorry.

56:51.340 --> 56:53.860
Isn't that nice?

56:53.860 --> 56:59.740
That's pretty awesome and of course we're getting a lot more releases over here as well

56:59.740 --> 57:06.180
not just Forza 2 which is still way off but this week though we've got some good stuff

57:06.180 --> 57:10.580
including brand new Wii games Sonic and the Secret Rings is going to be finally heading

57:10.580 --> 57:15.800
over to us so hopefully that one won't suck as bad as I know I don't know much about this

57:15.800 --> 57:21.580
Sonic but will it redeem the series it looks to me honest it looks just like the older

57:21.580 --> 57:26.620
Sonic games so I think that this will actually be pretty decent.

57:26.620 --> 57:31.720
I haven't played it though so I can't say the control issues are going to still be there

57:31.720 --> 57:41.580
even with the Wii being brand new systems and stuff and new control sets but I hope

57:41.580 --> 57:45.980
it looks like it has some party games in it that are pretty fun so hopefully.

57:45.980 --> 57:50.860
Other stuff coming out though we're going to have Virtua Fighter V on the Playstation

57:50.860 --> 57:55.020
3 that's going to be coming out this week which is pretty awesome on the 360 the game

57:55.020 --> 58:01.420
I've been playing and you've got to pick it up Crackdown as well also on the 360 there's

58:01.420 --> 58:07.140
going to be NBA Street Home Court that one's going to be pretty awesome on the Playstation

58:07.140 --> 58:14.020
2 Arena Football 2 Road to Glory if you're into that alternative type of game.

58:14.020 --> 58:24.980
Then of course on the PC here we've got Supreme Commander on PC.

58:24.980 --> 58:29.620
On the Playstation 3 download service Flow is supposed to finally make its way on the

58:29.620 --> 58:37.780
22nd let's see here on the DS Ozuna Legend of the Unemployed Ninja which should be pretty

58:37.780 --> 58:48.660
interesting and then also on PC Warfront Turning Point and also that's about it as far as the

58:48.660 --> 58:50.780
good stuff.

58:50.780 --> 58:56.860
Alright well moving on over to Japan where the video games come from a lot of times but

58:56.860 --> 59:01.020
also you know especially when it comes to Xbox 360 the U.S. kind of gets them first

59:01.020 --> 59:04.940
usually but it looks like they're doing a simultaneous release with Riot Act which is

59:04.940 --> 59:08.740
what they're going to call Crackdown over in Japan Riot Act is coming out this week

59:08.740 --> 59:13.820
over in Japan Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent also gets a release on the 22nd of February

59:13.820 --> 59:19.720

TV here it's a different company Untold Legends Dark Kingdom makes its way to Japan on the

59:24.620 --> 59:30.100
Playstation 3 coming out on the Nintendo Wii Fire Emblem for the Wii that should be really

59:30.100 --> 59:37.060

out on February 22nd coming out on the Playstation 2 you get a whole lot of stuff over in Japan

59:42.760 --> 59:45.660
what I thought was interesting though is that they're getting Destroy All Humans on the

59:45.660 --> 59:52.140
Playstation 2 so a game that was popular enough over here made its way over to Japan so Lupin

59:52.140 --> 59:57.100

Okay, actually there's on the 27th, there's also Flipper Critters and Jade Empire but that's next week

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.500
Hot Pixel was that one PSP game that's kind of like WarioWare, right?

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.220
It's not coming out until August here, I think.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.220
Hey, our UK friends get games first!

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.900
Wow, it's a first! Good job, UK!

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.100
Yeah, but too bad the game didn't look that good.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.220
Too bad the guy's kind of crazy, he's like this old dude.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.180
Oh yeah, that's right, he was talking to us and he was kind of creepy.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.020
I got his card but I felt like...

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:06.380
Well, he's not going to come on the show now, sorry.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:09.700
I just called him creepy. He has his own podcast, by the way.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.020
Does he? I bet it's creepy.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.360
Anyways, um...

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:24.180
So, apparently in the UK, there's this wonderful show called Watchdog that they investigate companies and stuff like that

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:31.420
that have either defective products or, you know, it's kind of like, I want to say there was something like this on Dateline

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.700
or something where they investigate different businesses and make sure that they're up to par or whatever.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:42.660
So they're investigating Microsoft about the Xbox 360 because apparently they're saying that the...

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:50.620
You know, they have received 248 complaints about faulty Xbox 360s and, you know,

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:56.180
they're saying that the return rate was, you know, larger than Microsoft initially said

01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:01.580
and that the fact that the owners had to spend, or some of the owners had to spend around 80 pounds

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:11.700
or about $156 to fix each of the units that just so happened to break after, you know, a year of purchasing the system.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.860
You know, at the same time, I just...

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:21.140
Aren't they a little late on this? You know, I mean, wasn't this whole defective 360 story like about a year ago?

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.500
I... I don't know.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.780
It takes time to build these cases, though, don't forget.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:29.260
And it is the UK and, you know, everything's delayed, unfortunately with them, so...

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:36.580
Anyways, so Microsoft, of course, responded saying that the claims made by the show are, you know,

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:43.860
false, that the return rate of the Xbox 360 is significantly lower than the CE industry average of 3-5%.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.020
Customer satisfaction is our highest priority and we do everything that we can to take care of the gamers

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.980
who may have problems with their consoles.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:55.700
Anybody having an issue with their 360 should call customer service immediately so that we can help.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:05:02.100
And, you know, to be honest, though, they did increase their warranty period for the 360 and...

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.700
I don't know, I think they're doing their part.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.900
I mean, I would say, how are these 360s being broken?

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.020
I mean, if it's people, you know...

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:14.940
I still hear my customers talking about, oh, yeah, this game came back scratched because there's a ring in it now

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:22.940
because, you know, someone's jiggled their 360 while it's going and it carved a big ring into their disc.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:25.940
So people are dumb.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.340
I thought the X meant I shake it.

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:34.460
What? The system's not like the Wii controller? It's not motion sensitive?

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.980
Actually, to be honest, the system is motion sensitive.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:40.900
It will know if you're laying it flat or if you're laying it upright.

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.660
It's true, it's true.

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:46.900
But that's a little, yeah, that's a little tiny little bubble that does that probably.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:52.220
Anyhow, speaking of watchdog agencies, the biggest watchdog of them all is the government.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:59.460
And Sam Brownback is a senator, a Republican senator, and he's also somebody who is running

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:07.460
for president in 2008, at least in Kansas, and he's exploring the Republican nomination

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.980
for the president of the United States.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:16.980
Well, Sam Brownback is also one of the minds behind the Video Game Rating Act, and it has been reintroduced.

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:22.100
It was first introduced last September, but it is now being reintroduced for Senate.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:26.940
If this was made law, what would happen is that the ESRB, you may remember us talking about this back in September,

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:32.300
the ESRB would have to play the final build of a game from the beginning to the end

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:35.940
until they could actually give it a rating.

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:39.380
Because I believe the way the ESRB works now, they're just filling out a questionnaire.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.340
Maybe they play a little bit of the game, but that's about it, right?

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:47.020
Yeah, it's the same way the MPAA works, and I don't see anyone cracking down the MPAA.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.940
I think the movies and the games should be done the exact same way.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.460
Why not? Why not?

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:57.940
I think movies, TV, and games should all be done the exact same way. Why not?

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:03.740
Let me give a quick quote, and I think Marissa wants to chime in too.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:12.300
Video game reviewers should be required to review the entire content of a game to ensure the accuracy of the rating.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:18.140
The current video game rating system is not as accurate as it could be because reviewers do not see the full content of games

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:22.380
and do not even play the games they rate.

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.420
Boy, they're going to be screwed when they have to review Oblivion or an MMO.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:27.220
Anyway, Marissa?

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.100
This issue in particular gets me really passionate.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:33.380
I watched a great documentary called This Movie Is Not Yet Rated the other day about the MPAA.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.420
I don't know if you've seen it.

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:39.780
I've heard of it, and I really want to see it, but I've heard it's just like Super Size Me resonated with McDonald's.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.980
I heard this movie resonated with the MPAA.

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:46.540
The government should not step in, but interestingly enough, I think there's a problem when the industry regulates itself

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.300
because it creates a monopoly.

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:53.140
I don't understand, like, for movies, for example, you can go to website kidsandmine.com,

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:55.740
and it just lists specifically what is in the movie.

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.780
I don't think a rating system is a good idea because then people interject their opinion into it.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:04.420
If you want to say there is sex in this, there's et cetera, and I know this is a really old Mimi,

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:09.580
but it still amazed me that people got upset about the hot coffee mod in Grand Theft Auto,

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:13.980
but they didn't have a problem with the fact that their five-year-old kid was killing hookers, et cetera.

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:18.220
Now, I like the game myself, but why is sex the problem?

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.220
Perfect example, the hot coffee thing.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:25.260
I mean, granted, it was an interactive little mini-game, whose graphics were really bad, by the way,

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:29.540
but yet I don't hear anyone complaining that there's a fucking sex mini-game in the original God of War

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:33.780
and in God of War II, which there's full fucking titties in the goddamn game.

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:34.740
Because it wasn't hidden.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.660
This wasn't...

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:36.700
Oh, it's not hidden.

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:37.260
Big deal.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.460
It's an M-rated game.

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:42.540
The difference between a 17- and 18-year-old, can you really say mindset-wise?

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.300
I mean, granted, okay, one's a legal adult,

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:49.100
but mindset-wise, one's gonna know about boobies as much as the other one.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.900
That's because they need to pull the corncob out of their ass

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:54.700
and stop fucking promoting a double fucking standard.

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:58.660
How would you feel if the video game was the exact same thing as the movie?

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.740
You pick up the box and on the back it says,

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.580
this game is rated R for sexuality and language.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.740
And it still says sexual content.

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.740
Isn't that how they do it in Europe?

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.140
Yeah, the UK, it's the same system.

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:11.900
Okay, it said it was rated M for sexual content.

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.300
It was on there.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.940
It didn't specify saying, oh, it's rated because of this minigame.

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.500
It said sexual content.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.020
So this is really getting...

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.220
Now you're starting to get into semantics here about,

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:26.100
oh, well, is this sexual content that made it M-rated and not this sexual content?

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:26.980
Who gives a shit?

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:30.420
It's M, it says sexual content.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.860
Do we need to do anything else?

01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:32.460
No.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:32.900
You know what?

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.140
People are stupid and there's a lot of...

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.380
I mean, no, I'm not saying this about everybody

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:38.940
because we have parents that listen to this program

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.660
and you're probably smart because you know how to download a podcast.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.340
But there's a lot of stupid parents out there.

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:47.140
And for their benefit, you know, I'm going to give a little here.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.660
It's about the world works with compromise, right?

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:53.220
My compromise is, okay, we will make one rating system.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.780
So you don't have to think like, okay, I'm not that smart, so I have to translate.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.220
And M means like an NC-17, okay?

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.540
Let's use one rating system across the board.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.860
That's my compromise.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.860
That way you stupid people don't have to memorize more than one system.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:09.020
I'm pretty sure that's how we do it in Europe, isn't it?

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.260
And that makes perfect sense.

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:16.620
You know, as actually, it's funny, sort of related to that,

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:20.900
our good friend Rob with two Bs, I wasn't going to cover this in the mailbag,

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:26.900
but he sent me an article about parents were suing MySpace

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.420
for their daughter lying about being 18.

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:34.300
My sister says she's 19.

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.940
I'm not finished.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.780
And their daughter going to meet up with this guy and then getting the hot nookie on.

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:41.820
And the parent was sued.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:45.740
Well, as the article states, the judge was like, fuck you.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.340
It was your job to police her.

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.740
That is the wrong person to be suing.

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:50.860
They need to sue the internet.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.580
Internet is the blame.

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.900
Sue Al Gore for an event again.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.740
Just to go ahead just a little bit into it.

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:59.180
It was a 12-year-old Texas girl lied about being 18,

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:02.940
met a 19-year-old man for dinner and a movie, and had some hot nookie.

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:06.620
And then the parents tried to sue MySpace for $30 million,

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:08.100
accusing the site of negligence.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:12.140
But the judge in the case, Judge Sam Sparks, turned around.

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.940
And I quote, if anyone had a duty to protect Julie Doe,

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.780
it was her parents, not MySpace.

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:21.020
All right, and what's in Judge Sam Sparks?

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.340
Judge Sam Sparks is our American Citizen of the Week.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:24.840
Yay.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.260
Our hats off to you for telling this parent to go fuck herself.

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.980
The reason why I think it was worth noting

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:42.220
is that, and actually, our RobOTV's also mentioned it,

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:45.820
that this might actually set a precedence now

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:49.140
for future cases involving parental negligence.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:49.740
I'm sorry.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.500
I just get really passionate on this issue

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:52.900
for being exceptionally yappy.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.980
But I mean, I agree with the idea of a rating system

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:58.020
because it is unfair that children feel a lot of pressure

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.100
nowadays to be hip and cool, et cetera,

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.820
and they want the same things we do,

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.220
which is a completely different rant of mine.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.060
Sex?

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.140
Sex is cool, too.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.020
But it's a completely different rant of mine

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.540
that we need to allow children to still be children and not

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.300
little adults.

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:13.900
But anyway, the only beef with the rating system

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.900
is, though, is that the GPG, et cetera, that, again,

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.020
is a personal opinion.

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.420
And actually, though, I think it makes it easier for parents,

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:25.060
for those who approve of more sexual content

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.660
because their own opinion or approve of less violence

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:29.340
or more violence, et cetera, you just

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.460
say explicitly what is in the game that

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.220
is different than saying, well, I believe

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.760
that this is because there's 12 different kinds of rated R

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.260
movies.

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.940
So there could be 12 different kinds of rated R games.

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.620
I know you look at a movie like Romeo and Michelle's

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.580
High School Reunion, that movie is rated R,

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.340
yet it's probably one of the most harmless movies

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:44.980
I've ever seen.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:48.100
Like, it gets rated R because Janine Garofalo says fuck

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.180
like three times.

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.980
And then you look at a movie like Sin City

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.620
that's rated R, where like, you know,

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:55.060
fucking bullets through heads, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:57.140
every other minute, titties everywhere.

01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.380
You know, there's a big, big difference.

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:00.860
Well, here's the other thing, too.

01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:02.580
And I hate how they always say, oh, we

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.860
need to put more responsibility on the ESRB

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:06.860
and rating these games.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.460
No, you have to put more responsibility

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.740
on these parents who just ignore the ratings.

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.020
And they say, oh, I didn't know this content was in here.

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.460
Yeah, you didn't know because you didn't read.

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.380
And then you bought it for your five-year-old

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.700
because you'll do anything for your five-year-old

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.620
and you won't even question it.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:23.940
You'll just like, OK, I'm going to buy him a fucking porno

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.440
then.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.540
I mean, seriously, if that's going

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:31.220
to be such an issue with you, it's just I don't understand.

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.700
And I don't understand how, OK, granted the content

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.620
was hidden in the game.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:36.580
OK, yippee, it's hidden in the game.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:40.420
So if I created, say, a series of GameShark codes

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:44.780
or something like that and made a topless mod for Tomb Raider,

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.980
a very elaborate process I might add that would probably be,

01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:51.820
then we get to sue IOS over that.

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.620
I mean, this is stuff that was created by someone else.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:56.660
It wasn't even in the final version of the game.

01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:00.020
And basically, you've pointed out

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.460
that this content is in there for parents that didn't know.

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.620
And even the parents that are suing about this

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:06.740
didn't know how to access the content in the game

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.820
or wasn't even aware.

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.940
Can I say this real quick?

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:10.980
I want to keep it moving.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.560
But I got to say, I blame the media to some extent, too.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:17.020
Because I bet if half the parents saw what the Tomb Raider

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.980
mod looks like or actually saw the mini game, they would go,

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.300
that's so stupid.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.540
But parents listen to what the media says.

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.660
And the media says, did you know your child can do real fucking

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:32.260
in Grand Theft Auto, like power-fucking

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.900
with the X button, coming to Grand Theft Auto tonight

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.020
on Xdrop?

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.800
You know, and I think parents go off of what they hear

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.940
and not what they're actually seeing.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.300
There's so much of that sensationalism that I think

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.900
takes everything to the nth degree.

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.260
I don't actually agree with that.

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.920
I'm just going to say this really quick.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.500
Because do you remember how big that Super Bowl thing

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.500
with Janet Jackson was?

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:58.660
Her titty was on television for a half a second.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.420
But it was covered.

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.300
It was covered.

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.740
It went and fucking freaked out, though.

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:08.180
It was covered with a stupid nipple shield.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.700
I saw the exact same thing on Fucking Girls

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.860
Next Door, where she had a stupid sticker over her nipple.

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.340
And then that was acceptable.

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.260
It wasn't a sticker.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.380
It was actually a piercing.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:19.500
Dude, my grandma came out once and didn't

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.740
realize I was in the room.

01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:21.860
And I didn't sue her.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.260
Movies kill.

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.660
Movies kill.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.060
It might have made me gay, but I didn't sue her.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.180
I'm just kidding.

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.180
That's not what made me gay.

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:34.300
I firmly believe it's a biological thing.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:38.620
Anyway, yeah, cock made me gay.

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.740
All right, anyhow.

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.700
Rheoma in chat says, Sky, never talk about that again.

01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:45.740
But I'm serious.

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.920
I mean, what kid didn't accidentally

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:53.660
see a titty at some point, or a dick?

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.180
Duke Nukem had boobies in it, too.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.220
Yeah, pixelated 8-bit boobies.

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.660
I mean, that's what they look like.

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.900
That's hot.

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:05.140
All right.

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:08.500
Anyhow, moving on.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.460
Every week, we invite you to give your feedback here

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.980
on our program through our mailbag, among other things.

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:15.700
We like to be an interactive program.

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.300
Because it's not just about us.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:20.260
It's not just about the three of us that run this program.

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.020
It's not just about Marissa or Chris or any of the other folks

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:23.620
you've heard.

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.200
Chris thinks it's all about her, but it's actually not.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.140
We invite you guys to interact with us by the chat room,

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:32.740
by the voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.660
or through the email bag, which you can email us every week

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.460
at mailbag at orangeontraday.com.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.060
We love getting your emails.

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:41.860
And DarkSakura, she's the queen of the mailbag.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.180
She likes to jump in there and pull out

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.380
some of her favorite emails.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.140
She's going to do that right now.

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.220
I'm going to pull it out.

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:56.060
I'm going to pull it out.

01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.580
You should have said that on mic.

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:02.540
And GS68 says, and you penetrate her weak point

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.620
for massive damage.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.020
Mailbag, please.

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.620
General alien crab bag.

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:08.580
I mean, wait.

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:09.820
Sorry.

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:10.780
Only.

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.660
WTB, mail.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.460
Rob.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.100
What?

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.620
Whatever.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:20.260
Four emails.

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:25.900
The first one from, I'm not sure exactly what to say,

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.700
the nickname ask.

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.300
Can we try something new tonight?

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.420
When you say that we're going to do the first email,

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:33.140
what I'd like Chris to do is to say very sexily,

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.900
letter number one.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.940
All right, so here we go.

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.460
So can we start from the top, please?

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:40.420
All right, here we go.

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.940
Say the first email.

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:44.340
OK, Chris.

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.020
Letter number one.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.420
All right, very good.

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:49.740
Dear Rob, DarkSakura, and Loki, I just

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.540
wanted to say hello to you all and tell you

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.780
how much I enjoy your program.

01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:54.940
I've been listening for a little over a year now.

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.740
I actually first found out about you guys

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:59.740
when looking for websites that were optimized to view on my PSP.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.260
Hint, hint, hint, hint.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:03.940
OLRPSP.com.

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:05.540
Anyway, what's the deal with Rice Princess?

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:08.060
She has a filthy, filthy mouth and is incredibly offensive.

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.820
You should have her on the show more often.

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.900
Keep up the good work.

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.060
Is Rice Princess still here?

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.980
Let me go find Rice Princess.

01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:17.020
Talk smack about Rice Princess quick before I get her in here.

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.740
Oh my god, Irene is so, no.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:24.500
I'm going to skip the, I'm going to go on to the next email.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:28.100
Email number two.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.780
You sounded like you had to go to the bathroom.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.140
Oh, wait a minute.

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.500
We just read one of your fan letters on the program.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.180
Oh, god, who won?

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.340
Is it true that you have an offensive, filthy mouth?

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.060
Fuck yeah.

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.820
Do you know any dirty jokes you can tell our listeners this week

01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:44.500
because our emailer said they liked having you on the show

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.060
because you had a very offensive mouth.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.180
So we just wanted you to say something offensive.

01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:50.700
OK, poop.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.700
That's pretty offensive.

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.020
That was on an offensive scale of 1 to 10.

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:54.940
That was like a 3.

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:58.820
OK, how about you lick the crusty poop out of my butt

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:00.900
and then you lick the crusty poop off my finger.

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.340
OK, I'm going to go.

01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:03.180
OK, that was a 9.

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:03.700
That was a 9.

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:04.380
That was much better.

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:05.620
All right, thank you, Rice Princess.

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:06.940
Thank you for your contributions.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.660
Do you want me to read it?

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.780
It's a good thing we haven't done any more your mama jokes.

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:10.300
All right.

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:10.820
Me too.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.060
Do you want me to do it again?

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:12.940
Yeah, you already did.

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.740
OK.

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.100
OK, I already did the email.

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:23.020
This one is email number 2 from SpeedyF40.

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:25.700
A year and a half ago, I tuned into OLR for the first time

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.380
after finding it on Podcast Alley.

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:31.340
I was not hooked, but like a festering rash, the good kind.

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.740
Your show grew on me, and a year and a half later,

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.340
I am still here.

01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:37.380
I have tuned into every show since that.

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.020
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:41.700
We're like the good kind of festering rash.

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.980
That's a really good compliment.

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.740
Rob, you guys are like the festering rash.

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:51.260
We're the festering rash of my love.

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:55.380
Could somebody who has not written a review on iTunes yet,

01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.380
somebody in chat volunteered to do this?

01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.220
OK, I want somebody in chat to yell out, claim this.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.100
Go to iTunes and give us a five star review, which actually

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:04.700
everyone should do, hint, hint.

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.720
But I don't want everybody saying

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.080
the show is a festering rash.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.300
So I want one person from chat to nominate themselves

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:12.460
to go write a five star review on iTunes and put,

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:16.140
this show is the festering rash of gaming podcasts.

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:16.860
The good kind.

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:17.580
The good kind.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:21.740
Genital herpes is forever, and so is my love for Orange Lounge.

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:23.900
And that, OK, somebody can lay claim to that one too.

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:24.620
I like that one.

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.020
Can I finish reading this now?

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.260
Yes, you may.

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:27.780
OK.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.100
Fester, Jamie, fester.

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.300
Bite my butt, but not really.

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.860
And you have even used one of my calls on air.

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:35.420
I love independent radio, and I feel

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:38.060
that your show is doing a service to the gamer community.

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:41.100
OLR has even inspired me to do my own show.

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:45.540
Loki, you suck because you don't like Max.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.940
No, that's really not what he said.

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:51.660
OK.

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.380
He didn't say that.

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:55.460
I know some people may see you as an ass.

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.940
You are, just not all the time.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.460
Most of the time I see you as an honest down to earth realist.

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:02.980
Loki, you set this story straight,

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.980
and your ties with the inside of the gaming world

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:08.260
give the show a sense of added credibility.

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:12.860
By the way, Apples do suck for gaming by a PC.

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.260
I would say in two to four years,

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:16.300
Apple computers will be a formidable gaming

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.020
computer for the average person.

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.540
Real gamers will stick with the PC,

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.380
but that is a whole other thing.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.820
Jamie, your alternative views on gaming and the gaming culture

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.580
broaden my mind and keep ideas flowing through my head.

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.460
I love how you speak your mind, even though I

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:30.420
know we will have some political differences.

01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:31.940
I hold your opinions on issues that

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:33.700
affect gamers in extremely high regards.

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.700
Well, thank you.

01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.660
That makes me feel warm in a special place.

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.700
My ex-boyfriend actually had a good quote on that.

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:43.420
He said, Macintosh makes the best computer out there.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:45.580
You know what the problem is?

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:48.660
Nobody cares.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.620
Do you have another email, actually?

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.420
There's more.

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.060
OK, I want to do the sexy announcement,

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.900
because on the internet, I'm kind

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:58.140
of geek famous for being the voice of a character on LJ

01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:59.020
Drama.

01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.020
OK.

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.900
All right, well, the third one is to Rob.

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:02.500
Oh, yay.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.500
You got a lot of balls being a gay gamer on the internet.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.260
Pun intended.

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:11.300
When I jumped on air for my own show,

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:17.220
I would have to say that I model some of my on-air presence

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.180
from yours.

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:21.500
With me being straight guy, I come off

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.820
as being very enthusiastic.

01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:27.460
I just don't get messages telling me I talk too much yet.

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:30.140
I love O-L-R. It is polished, and it is brilliant.

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:32.500
From your unconventional views on gaming and gaming culture

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:35.020
to the straight up format of the show, I love it.

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.660
I would not be who I am today on the internet and in real life

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:38.780
if it was not for you guys.

01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.040
Independent radio for the win.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:40.780
Speedy F40.

01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:42.780
P.S. Tell Rice Princess I have a crush on her

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:44.680
because she sounds like a freak.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.180
Wow.

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.100
Hey, Irene.

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:48.580
You have a fan.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.300
That's very, oh, wait.

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:52.340
Didn't he say he ran his own podcast?

01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:53.220
What is it?

01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:53.940
Didn't say.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:55.300
Is this his Speedy F40?

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.980
Is there like a signature or something?

01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.780
He has a crush on you because you're a freak.

01:22:58.780 --> 01:22:59.380
That's what he said.

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:00.260
Is you're a freak.

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.500
Speedy F40.

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:02.000
Oh, hi.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.500
Dude, if you're listening, and we're

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.620
pretty sure that you are because you're amazing,

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.380
send us a link to your podcast, and we'll plug you.

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.100
Totally.

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.340
We want to pimp that podcast.

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:12.900
We will totally plug you in the most awesome way.

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:16.100
Seriously, not to spend too much time talking about ourselves.

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:18.180
Because I don't want to be like that.

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:21.460
But that's truly one of the best compliments we could ever get.

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.460
Oh, wait, it's on here.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.140
Oh, wait, is it?

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:23.980
Oh, great.

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:28.420
WCradio.com, 5 PM Eastern time on Saturday.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.300
Oh, it's part of the WC Radio, Warcraft Radio,

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.540
like a huge radio thing.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:33.420
Really, it's Warcraft?

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.180
Yeah, isn't it?

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:34.820
Warcraft Radio.

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:39.540
Or maybe this is just a, I'm not sure if this is his or not,

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.740
but it's in the signature.

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:43.580
So check it out, maybe?

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:47.220
Well, hey, if you were going to spend all day playing

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:49.180
World of Warcraft, I know the soundtrack gets old,

01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:51.380
so you might as well listen to Warcraft Radio, right?

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.340
So go for it.

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.940
That's very cool.

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:55.980
And that's truly one of the best compliments.

01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:58.180
But can I say something about the gay issue

01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.620
without turning the show too gay as it is already?

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:02.060
It's already gay.

01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:04.820
It's actually not really been a big deal

01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:06.180
for me to be gay on this program.

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:09.060
Because I give a lot of props to the gaming community.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:12.540
And I think the youth in general is that I really

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.100
don't think people seem to care.

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:16.180
And I think if they do care, they're not listening.

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:17.940
So hey, all for the best.

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.940
This probably isn't their type of show anyway.

01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:21.540
If it was something they care about,

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.780
they'd probably want to listen to bigot Radio.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:26.620
But most people that have listened to this program

01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.420
really don't care.

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:29.660
I think that speaks volumes about the gaming community

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:32.740
is that, hey, there's nothing wrong with being gay.

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.740
But I don't want this to be the gay show either,

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.260
because that's not all I am.

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.580
And I think people get that wrong impression about me

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.100
sometimes is that I'm the gay gamer,

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:45.540
and that's all I can think about is how much cock is in my games.

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:48.580
At least you're not the titty queen.

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:51.140
Yeah, we plug the lesbian thing on me just because it's funny.

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:54.340
It's for the straight men.

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.900
This segment is getting entirely too gay.

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:57.580
All right, sorry.

01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:58.260
I just want to sit.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.820
Talk about your joystick some more.

01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:00.940
Wait, wait, sexy, please.

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:02.460
Except that boobs are hot.

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.660
Oh, I was just going to say, it's not all gay radio

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.500
unless you talk about your joystick too much.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.100
Rawr.

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.860
Oh, oh.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.740
Hi, it's me, Victoria.

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.860
Email number three.

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:16.700
Dude, that was hot.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:17.660
That was hot.

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.540
I got a semi.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:23.660
Hey, OLR, I started World of Warcraft for the New Year.

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.780
I fell in love with WoW until I installed the Burning Crusade

01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:27.780
expansion pack.

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.900
Oh my god, oh my god.

01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:31.940
No, I would not interrupt you if this is not the best thing ever.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:32.980
You interrupt me all the time.

01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:34.860
No, I would not do this if this is not the best thing ever,

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.360
DarkSaga.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:35.860
Trust me.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:38.580
DJ Jenai says, maybe we should rename the show

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:40.660
to the games and you show.

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.220
G-A-Y, games and you.

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.460
I don't understand, but it went and started up.

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.420
So I reinstalled it like two times,

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:52.740
and eventually I just called Blizzard.

01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.360
They told me that my graphics card just

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.980
happened to not be compatible with World of Warcraft.

01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.140
He told me, luckily, I was able to play for a while,

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.820
but once I installed the expansion pack,

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.980
it stopped working.

01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:06.500
I have a VIA S3G Unicrome Pro ITG graphics card.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.620
So just don't want anyone who plays World of Warcraft

01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:09.380
or is starting.

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:13.140
Just make sure that you should upgrade to a new graphics card

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:18.140
if you have the VIA S3G Unicrome Pro ITG graphics card.

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.820
So he has, like, an in the groove graphics card.

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:21.320
What?

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.020
Look.

01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:24.820
He's got an in the groove graphics card.

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:26.220
Oh, IGT?

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:28.460
No, that shoots a hole in my joke.

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.860
PS, my cousin bought Burning Crusade for my birthday,

01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.780
and now I can't play World of Warcraft at all.

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.300
Nice birthday present, isn't it?

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:35.420
Aw, don't cry, emo kid.

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:39.660
Tough advice from Chris.

01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:42.780
I reinstalled it, and it was a pain in the ass.

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.820
But I've got a Mac, so I don't need to upgrade anything.

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:47.580
Next.

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.900
Wait, what number?

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.380
Shut up, Rosa.

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.620
This is from Let's Have Tea.

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.940
Email what?

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.020
Number four.

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:57.900
Email number four.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.700
Hey there.

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:00.260
I don't know.

01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.420
I think my semi went away, because she sounded 17.

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:05.260
Fuck you.

01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:08.380
Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.

01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.860
Hey there, OLR, Let's Have Tea here.

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:13.060
I have been a longtime listener, even though I have only

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:15.100
actually tuned into the live show a few times,

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.020
podcast for the win.

01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:17.760
That's not what this email is about, though.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.180
A few weeks back, you were talking

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.640
about the Wii being used as a fitness weight loss tool.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.900
I was digging through Dig, ha, and came across a few

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.860
interesting articles.

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:27.900
One article was showing how somebody lost nine pounds

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.620
playing Wii Sports for 30 minutes a day for six weeks.

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:32.460
He didn't change his normal eating habits at all.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:33.940
He just played the game more.

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:36.220
And that's because it's exercise.

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:39.980
Also, it's activity for 30 minutes.

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.660
It will raise the heart rate.

01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:45.460
I burn weight doing massage three days a week for 30

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.460
minutes, so yeah.

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:50.020
You do any kind of exercise for 30 minutes a day, it's

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:50.620
going to do something.

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:53.100
If you don't eat McDonald's during that same length of

01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:54.820
time, you'll lose twice as much.

01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:56.780
Yeah, exactly.

01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.260
Also, I saw another article about wrist weight with the

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.740
Wii logo on them.

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:04.460
Sure, they were fan-created concept products, but there

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:06.140
are similar products out there for similar workout

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.260
activities.

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:09.300
Would any of you consider using one of these wrist

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:10.980
weights while playing an actual workout tool?

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:13.220
I considered getting a pair of generic ones to make it

01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:16.900
harder to play Wii tennis and actually give my friends a

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:18.060
chance at beating me.

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.580
What do you think of the whole Wii fitness idea?

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:24.980
Just to let you know, and this is just because of my recent

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:28.380
involvement in the health industry, I am not prescribing

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.420
nor recommending anything.

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:33.580
This is not a prescription, just to protect my ass.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:38.460
You do run a risk of damaging your wrists using a wrist

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.580
weight with anything that you have to flick or

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:43.060
move your wrist with.

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:45.940
Wrist weights are actually not all that safe to use.

01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:46.420
Exactly.

01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:51.260
No one wants to break their masturbating wrist.

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:59.460
My problem is I would not want to put more effort into it.

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:04.380
I say stand up and do it, because you burn more

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.620
calories standing up.

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:13.020
My problem is that I would not want to wear the wrist

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.220
weights, because I would be afraid that my wrist would

01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:17.940
hang down more than it already does.

01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:20.020
Then you'd look uber gay.

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:21.500
There's a visual there.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:26.660
You know, uh, radio visual joke.

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.060
Here, I got some advice.

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:32.500
Get up and go to the fucking gym.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.900
I have no patience for people who sit there and say, you get

01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:37.660
a great workout playing the video game.

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.620
No, you don't.

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:40.700
Actually, yeah, you do if you play DDR.

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:43.220
That's not the same thing, though.

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:44.140
Actually, not.

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:44.700
OK.

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:46.540
I can give you DDR.

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:48.820
I did get up and play.

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:51.540
It's a difference if you actually get up and move your

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.940
arm as opposed to sitting on the couch

01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.220
and flicking your wrist.

01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:58.180
If you get up and get into the game, you actually are

01:29:58.180 --> 01:29:59.340
elevating your heart rate.

01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:01.620
You are actually burning more than you are sitting down and

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:03.140
flicking your wrist.

01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.260
Yeah, but you need to also stop eating junk food.

01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:07.260
And you need to go outside in the sunshine.

01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.180
And you need to check yourself into a gym so

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.300
you don't turn fat.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.180
I see it as like steps.

01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:16.100
Like if you want to do a little bit that's better than

01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:17.340
nothing, you do the Wii.

01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:19.900
If you want to go all the way in, you do the gym.

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.460
It's kind of like different levels.

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:25.860
I think that Wii Sports is a great springboard into

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.900
building up activity levels, especially if you've been

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:29.980
living a sedentary lifestyle.

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:33.660
If you're going from Uber, couch, internet, potato, to

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:37.220
moving, playing the game, first of all, that's actually

01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.220
building up your energy, building up your endurance,

01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:40.660
even if it's minute.

01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:44.140
That is a good step into the next level of exercise.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:48.060
See, unlike a lot of my friends since I live in LA, I

01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:50.500
like to indulge in this activity on occasion.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.820
It's called eating.

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:57.660
And actually, I'm actually completely pro on the idea of

01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:58.340
working out with this.

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.420
Because quite frankly, it's not.

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.460
I mean, I completely agree with Chris.

01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:03.660
It's good to get out of the house, et cetera.

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:05.660
No, I'm in complete agreement on that.

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:06.340
I agree with that, too.

01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:08.940
But sometimes going to the gym sucks.

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.620
Let's face it, people go there to meet other people.

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:13.260
People are checking each other out.

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:16.100
And when I go in there and my fat ass, I am not interested

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:17.340
in that, I do want to get a workout.

01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:19.660
And if I can do it at home and not be bored out of my brain

01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.740
because the StairMaster goes nowhere, I feel like a

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:23.540
hamster wheel.

01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:25.660
I feel like I'm on the hamster wheel of life.

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.140
That if you get to do a lot of playing games, great.

01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:30.060
You pay $50 and you go up.

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.380
Dennis Leary for the win.

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:32.900
Yes, Dennis Leary.

01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:33.740
Life sucks.

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:35.300
Get a helmet.

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:37.740
Yay, I'm sorry.

01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:42.140
Another thing, though, is you know, and this is what I'm

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:44.140
going to do for my, because I used to be an utter gym

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:47.220
junkie before I developed chronic fatigue syndrome

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:49.500
because I was going to the gym five days a week.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.540
I dropped something like 85 pounds in two and a half

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.460
years, which I hate you for.

01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:59.820
Jamie used to have a few extra pounds, but she's lost it all.

01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:01.020
She's hot.

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:05.460
I don't care saying I went from a size 22 to a size 12 in

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.060
two and a half years.

01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:15.140
So I think, you know, going to the gym was good for me

01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:17.300
because I actually like to lift weights because I like

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:18.700
being stronger.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.260
But cardio is fucking boring.

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:23.900
So I'm actually, now that I have the OK to go back to the

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.860
gym, I'm actually going to be taking, OK, I've been slightly

01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:29.260
obsessed with Dancing with the Stars lately after watching

01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.900
Stacey Keebler's Legs.

01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:32.540
So I'm going to actually take ballroom dancing.

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:33.900
You know what they should have?

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:35.580
They should have wee yoga.

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:37.620
Wee yoga would be amazing.

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:41.100
They kind of have something like that on Xbox.

01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.100
And I think there was a version on GameCube.

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.060
I know there was on PS2.

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:46.300
It was that Think Fitness game or whatever.

01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:49.540
I think it had yoga in it.

01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:53.700
So that, you know, and I want the entire tardy listeners to

01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:57.620
know that when I say, yeah, you can fucking go to the gym,

01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:00.020
this is from experience, OK?

01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.740
You can get off your ass and do it.

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.900
You just have to want it bad enough.

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.020
Nothing changes until you want it bad

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:07.580
enough to make it change.

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:08.220
Thank you, Jamie.

01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:11.420
But would it be fair to say there's also alternatives?

01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:13.340
Because we have a lot of folks in the chat saying gyms are

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.980
expensive or folks don't like the gym environment.

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:18.540
Like JB Monn says, gyms in the village in NYC are just big

01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.260
bath houses with exercise equipment.

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.020
It's called going outside and walking.

01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.060
There's alternatives.

01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:26.940
And maybe go outside, run, go outside, walk, find a walking

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:29.740
buddy, do something to make yourself more fit.

01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:32.660
But wouldn't this be at least a little baby step in the

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:33.540
right direction?

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:34.900
Yeah, I granted that.

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:35.940
I granted that.

01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:38.220
I just, it's just people annoy me.

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.540
And for Ryoma, a special message for you.

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:41.780
Fuck your Yankee blue jeans.

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.140
Yay.

01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.500
Anyway, there's more to that email.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:48.980
There's more to that email.

01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:49.460
Oh, more?

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:50.460
OK, wow.

01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:51.380
A little bit.

01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:53.340
We were at the end.

01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:54.500
Again, I love the show.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.580
And thank you so much for the many hours of entertainment

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.380
and news you have provided everyone.

01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:01.140
I'm a quote, truck driver, pickup truck, ha ha.

01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:03.500
And have to drive a little over an hour straight every

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:04.460
Saturday and Sunday.

01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:06.700
So your podcast really helps pass the time.

01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.620
Thanks again, and best wishes.

01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:12.140
And it also says, let's have T rates as low as 4.65%.

01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:17.140
Refinance $150,000 loan for $579 a month.

01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:18.500
Amazing.

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.660
And you want to know what's funny?

01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:25.380
Since I work in the mortgage industry, that actually isn't

01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:27.740
really all that great in you unless you have an

01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:29.020
interest-only loan.

01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:30.940
Isn't that some ad that goes on the bottom of the email

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.300
automatically?

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:33.420
I think it's hilarious.

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:35.580
I work in the mortgage industry, so whenever I see

01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.700
those things, I go, oh, that's shitty.

01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:40.060
Because I know how to read loan documents.

01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:41.300
It actually is another language.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.740
Too bad this isn't a banking show.

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:47.460
Yeah, but I have tomorrow off, so suck it.

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:48.540
No, you suck it.

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.140
I have to work tomorrow.

01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:51.620
Suck it twice, ha.

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.100
Suck it infinity.

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:54.660
Oh, yeah?

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:55.340
Oh, yes.

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:59.780
Well, you can eat a hairy clam.

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:02.420
Did she tell me to eat a hairy clit on?

01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:04.020
Is that what?

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.340
She said a hairy clam.

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.580
Polish my pearl, Rob.

01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:09.580
Fucking gross.

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:16.260
This show just got rated AO.

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:17.980
I can't believe.

01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:20.180
I think in like, what is this?

01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:20.860
Episode 220?

01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:23.140
In 220 episodes of Orange House Radio, that was a

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:26.820
phallus thing that bitch has ever said to me.

01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:29.580
I had the top Irene's crusty shit.

01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:30.180
Oh, OK.

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:31.220
No, no, Rob.

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:33.620
Remember, you are a douchebag.

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:36.940
Yes, Rob, is the official douchebag of Orange House.

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:40.900
Why are you bringing up like five-year-old drama of a guy

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:42.580
that drives me nuts?

01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:44.340
There's this guy who drives me.

01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.060
Oh, it's like Neil's on a chalkboard.

01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:47.820
No, no, no, I'm not going to say it, because I know I'm not

01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:48.900
going to give attention.

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.220
I will say it.

01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:53.860
He works for a major gaming blog now, and I'm just like,

01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:56.620
oh, this guy's annoying.

01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:59.060
Yeah, he called me a douchebag once at a DDR tournament, and

01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:01.260
in my response, I was like, because Irene was with me, I

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:03.900
was like, oh my god, Irene, I'm vinegar and water.

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:06.820
Did you hear that?

01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:07.940
You're clean.

01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.620
Yes, at least I'm clean.

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.940
Cut your hair.

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.220
All right, anyway, that's it.

01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:14.620
I don't want to get into drama, because I

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:16.540
really don't care.

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:17.740
I'm at least years old.

01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:19.180
I don't even know why this person didn't

01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:20.980
like me, to be honest.

01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:22.260
Because he's fabulous.

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:24.140
I mean, I know why I don't like him, because

01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:24.900
he didn't like me.

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.420
It's like, you started it.

01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:28.940
He has an electrocuted corncob, but yes, it has this.

01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:32.260
But just so tight that any time they pull it out, it bleeds.

01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:34.220
All right, anyhow, can we please change the subject?

01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:35.140
I don't want to talk about it.

01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:36.460
I was just trying to talk about it.

01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:37.780
The years old drama.

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:41.220
All right, somebody, please, anybody.

01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:42.380
Oh, was that the end of the mailbag?

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:43.820
Yes, I told you.

01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:47.020
Let's close the mailbag and get back into the news, please.

01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:48.420
I blame Chris and Marissa for making me

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.540
a Tiger Clawed

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:50.780
That's all right.

01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:54.140
Anyways, Tiger Clawed is not Gaming Steve.

01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.980
That's Scott's issue.

01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:57.900
I don't even know Gaming Steve.

01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.300
Anyways, so speaking of idiotic, there's

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.820
a brand new channel added to the Wii this week called

01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:07.940
Everybody Votes, which is not true, because not everybody

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:08.860
does vote.

01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:09.660
They should.

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.620
You should be locked out for, yeah, anyways.

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.100
So yeah, the Everybody Votes channel,

01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:17.660
and you get to vote on such wonderful topics like,

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:19.780
what's better, dogs or cats?

01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:21.620
Woo-hoo.

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:22.940
Yay, that's fun.

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:27.140
Worth my Wii to be flashing, by the way,

01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:30.060
and it's still flashing, because I have not turned it on

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:31.860
since the stupid channel came out.

01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:35.660
But apparently, you can vote on these,

01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:37.700
you find out the results, and then it

01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:41.660
gets logged into your profile to how many you got right

01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:42.940
versus how many you got wrong.

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:46.220
And I guess you can show people your Wii penis.

01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:48.500
To be honest, I wish this channel was Everybody Poops,

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.260
because that would be a lot better.

01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:52.180
That would be true, but should that

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:55.340
be a question, which do you prefer more in the bathroom,

01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:58.140
one or two?

01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.920
Well, with two, you can read.

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.460
I mean, one, you're, anyway, this is disgusting.

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:05.700
I actually think the channel is really cute.

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.060
I didn't have a problem with it.

01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.940
I think it's, you know, it's not,

01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:13.100
like, it's the perfect kind of, Nintendo did not

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:14.500
make any fanfare out of it.

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:17.340
This is probably just something that used to be a tech demo.

01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:19.740
I mean, we're going to be seeing a lot of crap like this,

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:21.860
but Nintendo did not try to sell this to anyone.

01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:23.620
They did not try to put it out, like, by the Wii,

01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:24.500
because we had the Everyone Votes channel.

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.420
No, it's just like, hey, we're just

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.100
going to put this up because we're bored.

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:29.620
We're going to put up this Everyone Votes channel

01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:31.420
just because we have it, and here it is.

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:33.660
And it reminds me of this old-ass game,

01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:35.120
and I can't even remember what the name of the game is.

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.900
I hope somebody in chat remembers.

01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.020
But it was by the people that did Acrophobia,

01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:39.780
if you remember that game.

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.980
It was, like, a game show type thing

01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:42.280
you could play on the computer.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.940
And there was one that, like, had a game where

01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.700
you were playing with, like, 50 other people,

01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:47.660
and there were polls.

01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:49.580
And you tried to guess how everybody else would answer,

01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.180
and you moved up this little pyramid,

01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.060
depending on how accurate you were.

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.340
This really reminds me of that.

01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:58.900
It's not a game, per se, but it has tracked your predictions.

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:01.900
And when I did the Dogs and Cats,

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:04.500
I actually thought worldwide, because it's a worldwide catch

01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:06.340
on, I thought cats would be more popular.

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:07.100
And I was wrong.

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.260
And when the results came in, I was like, oh, I

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:10.060
can't believe it.

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:11.600
And I was like, oh, I kind of just

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:14.380
got emotional over a video game, a stupid little thing.

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:16.920
So I mean, it was a little thrill, and it's free.

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.380
So I don't think it's a bad thing.

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.740
I think it's cute.

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:22.180
There are any kittens left because

01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.300
of all the masturbating.

01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.260
That's why.

01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:27.780
I see.

01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:29.060
All right, well, there you go.

01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:31.580
Did anybody else try the voting channel?

01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.540
I watched Extra for Do It last night.

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:34.040
Was it?

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:35.540
It was hot.

01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:36.500
Was it cute, though?

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:37.980
I thought the channel was cute.

01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:42.020
I hate the entire world because cats are more awesome.

01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:44.780
Actually, I believe it was Switzerland

01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:46.700
where cats outrank dogs.

01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.500
So let's all move to Switzerland.

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:50.260
We have a Norway listener in chat tonight.

01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.300
I love our Norwegian listener.

01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:57.060
So Olaf, we need to get Olaf a cat, Olaf the Viking a cat.

01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:00.740
I want pictures of, never mind, that's a Dr. Who reference.

01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:02.180
Anyhow, sorry.

01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:06.860
All right, so go vote if you want on your Wii right now.

01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:09.220
Another thing you can do on your Wii right now is download

01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:12.580
Kid Icarus, but you should know that some of the codes

01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:15.260
that you may remember from your childhood, they don't work.

01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:19.020
If you want to put in Icarus Fights Medusa Angels,

01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:20.700
that code is not going to work.

01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:22.500
There is a warning before you download it.

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.980
It says the original Kid Icarus allows players

01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:26.140
to use secret passwords.

01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:28.300
However, Virtual Console does not support these passwords.

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.300
And at first, I thought that meant passwords

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:31.500
weren't going to work at all.

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.740
And that's not true.

01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:37.940
You still can use the old little jumble 0080C whatever type

01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:39.120
passwords.

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:41.980
It's just the secret ones won't work because apparently

01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:45.380
the original cartridge had an included module in it

01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:46.820
to process the special codes.

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.820
I never realized that.

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:52.740
But don't the emulators emulate those codes?

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:54.700
So that seems so weird to me.

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.780
Like if you play this on Nesticle or whatever

01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:03.580
those NES emulators are you use, can't you use those codes?

01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:04.180
Yeah.

01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:07.620
So I don't get it.

01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:08.820
Because they're lazy?

01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:10.900
Well, I don't know enough about hardware, I guess.

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:13.340
Because they're too busy working on everybody votes to,

01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.060
I don't know, fix their Virtual Console stuff?

01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:19.300
I don't think everybody votes was already done

01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:23.020
in some capacity, I think, as some type of demonstration.

01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:23.780
It's not that.

01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:28.580
I'm talking about this thing here.

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.180
But really, maybe it was just done

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:32.500
so that people would have to see how fucking hard Kid

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.980
Icarus really was.

01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:35.580
Because I think a lot of y'all forgot.

01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:37.740
Because you used to use those passwords to just beat

01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:38.260
the game.

01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:40.100
But Kid Icarus is fucking hard.

01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.540
It is, but it's awesome.

01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:42.060
It is.

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.540
It's definitely worth your time.

01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:44.060
I love that game.

01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:44.940
It's worth $5.

01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:46.300
She's going to be in the middle.

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.020
You'll never get a sequel.

01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:49.780
Never.

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:52.540
Fuck you, I hate you.

01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:55.620
Well, speaking of the Virtual Console,

01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.380
we do actually have some other news.

01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:00.020
There's a few of the Japan only games

01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:03.220
that are going to be coming onto the US Virtual Console.

01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:06.420
It's pretty cool.

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.380
It's actually with a conversation

01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:12.420
with Nintendo of America senior VP, George Harrison.

01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:15.380
They are looking into bringing some of the more successful

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:19.740
Japanese franchises that have that cult following in the US

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:21.180
on the Virtual Console.

01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:24.900
Basically, those of us who are the niche gamers, they love us.

01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:27.060
Nintendo loves us.

01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:28.220
That's proof.

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.380
So they're talking about bringing over

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:33.180
some of the games if they can have them translated properly.

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.980
I'm sorry, but if they really loved us,

01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:37.180
they would have made the fucking thing region free.

01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:38.340
True.

01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:41.980
However, they still haven't given me Guardian Legend.

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.660
Bastards.

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:45.420
Guardian Legend is that game we will always

01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:47.700
bitch about that we will never get on Virtual Console.

01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:49.980
Guardian Legend is the actually.

01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:51.260
Greatest 8-bit game ever made.

01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:52.460
That's all that needs to be said.

01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:52.940
Indeed.

01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:56.420
And then it's followed by the greatest 16-bit game ever made.

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.220
Rondo of Blood.

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:00.660
Now, I think about wasn't the MSX announced

01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:02.940
as one of the systems they were going to emulate in Japan

01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:03.740
on Virtual Console?

01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:04.460
I do believe so.

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:07.220
Because if we get an MSX emulator on here,

01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:08.700
do you know what that means we get?

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:10.540
Metal fucking gear.

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:12.980
The real sequel to Metal Gear 2?

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:15.980
Dude, that's it right there.

01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:16.940
That's what I want.

01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:19.820
You write that right under Guardian Legend on the wishlist.

01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:22.180
On MSX, there were two Guardian Legend games.

01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:24.700
That would be on the same list of, yeah, sure.

01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:28.780
We'll implement online before we implement this shit.

01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:29.740
Fuck you, I hate you.

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:32.340
But on the MSX, there actually were two Guardian Legend games.

01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:34.380
It's called Guardia.

01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:35.380
I've heard of Guardia.

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:38.100
I've never played it, but that would be hot.

01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:39.300
I would settle for Guardia.

01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:43.940
I had a photograph of it once that my MSX emulator

01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:45.420
wouldn't run, so I was so upset.

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:51.340
And I'm sure that everyone's going to be, well,

01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:53.940
I don't know if anyone's really going to be interested in this,

01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:56.100
but apparently they're putting out Brunswick Pro

01:43:56.100 --> 01:44:01.300
Bowling for Nintendo Wii, the PlayStation 2, and PSP.

01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:08.180
Honestly, ask yourself, when ever, ever,

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:10.100
other than Wii Bowling, has there ever

01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:13.260
been a good bowling game on any console?

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.300
You just said it, Wii Bowling.

01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:16.580
Other than Wii Bowling.

01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:18.500
The Tekken bowling game on Tekken.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.540
Oh, shush.

01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.060
It was fun.

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:23.220
For three seconds.

01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:26.900
Can I be really lame and not console oriented

01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:30.020
and say that elf bowling was awesome?

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.300
Whee!

01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:35.700
How about, what's the one they had at the Metreon years ago,

01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.780
Mega Bowling, or whatever that thing was for you?

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:40.020
Touch Bowling, the one with the, no, that wasn't at the Metreon.

01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:41.140
This was the giant ball.

01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:42.260
Dave & Busters has it, too.

01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:43.980
Dave & Busters, with the giant screen.

01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:44.860
Ahead of the Metron, too.

01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:46.700
I remember this, because we played it there.

01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:50.500
And Neo Geo Bowling, Ryoma says, and Clubhouse Games.

01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.900
But because everybody loves Wii Bowling,

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:55.140
somebody said, let's turn this into an actual full-fledged

01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:55.540
game.

01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:56.340
Yeah, that's great.

01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:58.460
Let's charge something that you can get, I don't know,

01:44:58.460 --> 01:44:58.960
for free.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:00.940
There's a pinball game called 9 Pin.

01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:02.620
Well, let's just make another game that's

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:06.060
exactly the same as the last one and charge you money for it.

01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:08.300
That's OK, because it's Brunswick Pro Bowling.

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:11.060
And I'm sure, to be honest, though, when it does come out,

01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:15.500
it'd be like $20, so who gives a shit?

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.180
I mean, it's going to be cheap.

01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:20.260
I mean, God crave.

01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:22.820
I mean, I don't know.

01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:27.820
The last, what was it, the last, they had some, I want to say,

01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:31.180
Extreme Bowling 2006 that came out last year.

01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:33.460
It was uber lame, by the way.

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:40.300
So hopefully, they will go with the same kind of gameplay

01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.660
as Wii Bowling, but somehow, I think

01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:46.780
they're going to fuck it up, because they always fuck it up.

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:47.620
Comments from chat.

01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:50.460
James Patrick says, Elf Bowling, shooter.

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:56.260
DJ Jenai says, Elf Bowling, it's more fun if you're drunk.

01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:58.700
DJ Dark Knight says, Simpson Bowling.

01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:01.660
Alpha Canagram agrees, Tekken Bowling.

01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:03.700
Gaming Nerd says, let's throw our Wiimotes directly

01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:04.900
into our TVs and break them.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:08.020
Oops, I thought I was holding a bowling ball.

01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:11.780
At Def says, what I do want is a new baseball game for the Wii.

01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:15.740
And Tiger Claw remembers, guys, what about Hyper Bowling?

01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:17.860
It came with Microsoft Plus for the XP.

01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:18.660
That's what it was.

01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.100
It was called Hyper Bowling, but you actually

01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:21.940
had a bowling ball, because that was the version of it

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.100
that they had in the arcades.

01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:25.060
It was Hyper Bowling, but with an actual ball that you roll.

01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:26.140
Anyway, forget it.

01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:30.140
But I was excited that Tiger Claw reminded me

01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:32.940
of the name of that.

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:34.380
Is that it, or any more stories?

01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:35.420
Oh, next story is mine.

01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:37.140
Whoops, my bad.

01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:38.620
Ha ha, fail.

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:41.220
And it has to do with one of my very favorite countries,

01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:43.300
the only other country I've really been to.

01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:43.980
I can remember.

01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:45.260
I went to the Caribbean when I was seven,

01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:46.180
but that doesn't count.

01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:48.420
So the only other country I've really been to is Canada.

01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:53.780
And Canada, even though we have a lot of Canadian listeners,

01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:56.300
things are kind of quiet gaming-wise in Canada.

01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.860
I mean, sure, you got some of the game studios in Toronto,

01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:00.940
Vancouver, but for the most part,

01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:03.240
you don't hear a whole lot of big gaming news coming out

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:03.740
of Canada.

01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:04.620
Well, now guess what?

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:07.860
ESA has their sights set on Canada,

01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:11.340
because apparently Canada has pirates galore.

01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:16.780
I think they're confusing pirates

01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:18.660
with maple syrup or hockey.

01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:22.540
A coalition of American media industry trade groups

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.860
is asking the US government to say

01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:28.180
that Canada is on the list of the world's worst countries

01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:30.220
when it comes to enforcing intellectual property

01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:32.460
rights and fighting piracy.

01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:35.060
This was from the seven-member IIPA,

01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:37.480
International Intellectual Property Alliance.

01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.940
And they're saying that Canada has

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:41.880
failed to deliver on promises of more stringent copyright laws

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.940
and stepped up enforcements for laws already on the books.

01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:48.380
Quote, Canada remains far behind virtually all of its peers

01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:50.680
in the industrialized world with respect to its efforts

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.480
to bring its copyright laws up to date

01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.500
with the realities of the global digital networked environment.

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.560
Indeed, even the major developing countries

01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.740
have progressed further and faster than Canada

01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:01.180
in meeting the challenge.

01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:04.900
Insert mandatory playing Canada joke here.

01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:07.880
Hey, I just have a personal experience.

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:09.820
All my Canadian friends love Warcraft,

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.700
but then again, who doesn't, and pot,

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:17.660
and preferably at the same time, which really confused me.

01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:22.020
So what does a Canadian pirate look like?

01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:24.540
I don't know.

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.460
Jack Sparrow that kind of smells like maple?

01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:27.300
I don't know.

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:30.420
No, I have this image of like a bobsled that looks like a ship

01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.140
with a sail on it and dogs.

01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:34.940
Are mush.

01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:35.980
No.

01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:38.660
I'm going to Canada later this year.

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:39.220
That's good.

01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:40.140
Canada is a fun place.

01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:43.980
And I'm going to find me a Canadian pirate.

01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:45.740
Maybe he'll find your booty.

01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:54.340
What the fuck is a ferret?

01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:55.340
It's a ferret joke.

01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:56.820
Look, a ferret's been absorbed.

01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:57.980
I'll hit myself with Kirby.

01:48:57.980 --> 01:48:58.660
There you have me.

01:48:58.660 --> 01:48:59.780
Isn't that DNL's Kirby?

01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:00.740
It's DNL's Kirby.

01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:01.740
She needs to come get it.

01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:02.740
DNL, you need to come get your Kirby.

01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:04.900
Because I'm getting my cooby cootie coobies.

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:08.180
I'm getting my cooties all over this Kirby that DMN brought.

01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:08.740
On my nipple.

01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:09.340
Look at that.

01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.900
There you go.

01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:12.380
Just for you, Renee.

01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:14.260
He's sexing it up for you.

01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:17.460
Well, I have some uses better than blaming Canada for shit.

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:18.060
What's that?

01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:20.180
Well, actually, it's not really all that exciting.

01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:23.180
But DirecTV has something called Game Lounge now.

01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:26.340
And it's this interactive channel for family stuff

01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:28.380
that you'd get played through your satellite box.

01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:31.460
So it's like Xbox Live suck edition.

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:36.260
It has games that are based on kid shows like SpongeBob.

01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:40.140
And it has competitive games where you can compete

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.380
for prizes and money.

01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:44.700
And you should check it out, I guess,

01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:48.340
if you are into family games.

01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:50.220
I like for my games to have blood and sex.

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:51.700
Gaming Lounge?

01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:52.820
It's called Game Lounge.

01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:53.340
Game Lounge.

01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:55.620
Was Orange Lounge taken?

01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:56.860
Oh, I guess it was.

01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:58.900
Didn't we contemplate changing the name of the show

01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:00.100
to Game Lounge at one point?

01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:00.620
No.

01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:04.300
Because I thought we did.

01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:05.820
Then maybe I'd put that, because we

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:07.260
were having those problems with nobody

01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.220
understands that Orange Lounge Radio is a gaming

01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:11.640
show, because people don't get the Orange Lounge reference

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:12.980
with DDR and Bimani.

01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:15.700
But that's why this year was me.

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:16.540
You know what, Rob?

01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:17.940
We did have a conversation on that one.

01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:20.020
You said, hey, what if we change our name to Game Lounge?

01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:20.780
And we both went, no.

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:21.460
Yeah, exactly.

01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:22.260
Just like that.

01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:23.620
Yeah, it was just like that.

01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:28.380
This was a dramatic recreation.

01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:30.340
Hey, guys, I have this really great idea.

01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:32.100
No.

01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:32.660
That was it.

01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:34.020
That was it right there.

01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:37.540
That was the recreation.

01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:41.380
Just shot down again by Jamie.

01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:42.100
Rob?

01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:42.580
What?

01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:44.300
Heart.

01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:47.260
All right.

01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:51.260
Anyhow, we've gone very long, this statement,

01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:52.540
almost two hours.

01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:54.700
Marissa, can you believe this show is only half over?

01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:00.860
If this is torture, then chain me to the wall.

01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:02.940
But the listeners like it when it's long.

01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:06.660
I bet you guys like it long, don't you?

01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.060
You like it long.

01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:10.020
All right, well, we're going to take a quick break,

01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:12.100
and we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge

01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:15.900
Radio with part B of our show.

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:18.860
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:21.380
and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:24.020
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion

01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:51.420
of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
