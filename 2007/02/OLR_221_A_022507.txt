Tonight, February 25th, 2007, plenty of new games for the Virtual Console are discovered, some Xbox 360 games are getting a price cut, and one TV station warns us about sexual predators on online games.
Orange Lounge Radio
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
If you play games online, you might see me post on forums.
Not joining us tonight, sadly, is DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.
She had some prior family engagements to attend to.
We will be hearing from her in a special pre-tape segment later in the show.
But we've secretly replaced DarkSakura with a furry gay man tonight.
Say hello to Eddie.
I'm yummy.
Oh, Casper the Gay.
Am I supposed to refer to you as Casper the Gay?
Yeah, pretty much.
No, it's all right.
I don't care.
How are you doing, Casper?
I'm great.
I came down here having a good time.
You remember those old commercials?
It's like, we secretly replaced so-and-so's folgers with the new decap.
I don't know what the hell it is.
I feel like we secretly replaced Jamie with a furry gay man.
And they'll never know.
All right.
Well, also joining us tonight, the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
Hello.
And we did not replace him with a furry gay man.
Thank God.
Did we?
Did we?
No, we didn't.
Alright, how you doing, Loki?
I'm doing fine.
Good, good to hear.
I'm glad to see you're eating healthy tonight with the old Mickey D's.
You know, their sweet and sour sauce tastes like it's been sitting out for a long time.
It tastes a little off.
But that does not mean that I'm not gonna, you know, and I'm also disappointed they only got two packets of sweet and sour sauce versus three, because three's a lot better.
Doesn't McDonald's have some stupid policy, like if you order Yates or any nuggets?
Yeah, but ten pieces, I'm supposed to get three.
They fucking jipped me.
Why don't you go in and ask to speak with the manager?
Because I don't care.
You can be one of those people.
I'm sure anybody in our chat room who's worked for fast food in the past has some story about some fucking bitch who came in there because they wanted extra sauce or, you know, oh, you got to let the people at the drive-thru who order, like, I want a super-sized burger, chicken McNuggets, super-sized fries, oh, and a Diet Coke.
Or even better, I want a six-piece McNugget with 12 sides of sweet and sour sauce.
That's right, it makes me angsty.
Makes me angsty.
Goddammit, that's the second week in a row that's happened with him.
That's more than a second week in a row.
That's been like four weeks in a row.
I've been doing it on purpose.
Alright, say hello as well tonight to... Murder!
Say hello to Rice Princess.
How you doing, Rice Princess?
Now's when you're supposed to cue One Wing Angel.
That's all right.
How you doing, Rice Princess?
I'm doing pretty good.
I'm eating McDonald's, too.
I'm eating McDonald's, too.
Is this loud enough?
Yeah, see?
Now, tonight I'm letting you see the monitor so you can see what you're allowed to do.
Can I have a not-crappy mic to talk into?
Because I hate yelling and making it sound like I'm falling off a cliff.
All right.
How you doing, though, otherwise?
Pretty good.
All right.
Yep.
All right, well, also say hello to our chat room.
Always another guest here on the program.
It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Hello, I'm in the chat room.
I noticed Tiger Claw in the chat room says, Sky, you do know the Oscars are on.
Yep.
Well, last week it was the Grammys, or two weeks ago it was the Grammys.
This week it's the Oscars.
We just can't win.
We're always up against something.
I mean, but come on.
Who cares?
You're going to be able to read it tomorrow morning who won the Oscars.
And let's be honest, you and I both know most people listen to this show in the audio archive or podcast form.
And they can listen to that in the convenience of whenever they want.
So it won't be up against the Oscars in that regard.
So we have to just keep doing the show like always.
Because if you want, I mean if you don't want us to talk about video games, we could just kind of like turn on the Oscars and just give live commentary.
God, Kate Winslet looks fat.
Wouldn't that be fun?
I did see two.
I will say Oscar chat real fast, even though we're supposed to be keeping the random down tonight.
I will say I saw that Notes on a Scandal, which is the one that Judi Dench is nominated for.
I went out and saw that last night.
It's pretty good.
Judi Dench plays a good, crazy old woman.
She really does.
I hope she wins, but I didn't see The Queen.
I hear that was really good, too.
But Judi Dench, has she ever been bad in any movie?
Nope.
I don't think she has.
All right.
Joshi16 in the chatroom has some harsh words for the podcast listeners.
He said, podcast equals lazy fans.
Ouch.
Burn.
Alright, well let's get right into how we always start off the show A little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week Where we talk about what we've been playing And usually our chatroom gets into it too Oh, first off, speaking of chatroom, I want to say hi to the new listeners I always make a chance to try to say hi to noobs that are in chat Little thing noob Misty's not a noob, she's a long time listener She's in chat tonight, she hasn't been there for a long time So hi Misty Frisbee, I don't recognize that name And if I'm mistakenly pegging you as the new listener, I miss you, I apologize My brain can only hold so much
I don't recognize HeOn64, that must be new, so welcome.
Proper T, RoboBoy, actually maybe there's been a RoboBoy before, I don't know.
RoboBoy, I don't recognize you.
So hi noobs, or people I'm calling noobs because I didn't recognize your name.
Welcome to chat.
We have a lot of folks in chat tonight, a lot of regulars in there.
We appreciate your support as always.
But again, if you can't listen to us live because some of you guys have other things to do on Sunday nights like Oscar parties or whatever stupid stuff you're doing, you can always download our podcast.
Send us emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
Leave us voicemails, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Okay, I'll shut up.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was good.
It was all crackdown.
Lots and lots of crackdown.
And the game is awesome.
Except some co-op, depending on who you're playing with, I guess, can be very buggy or very laggy.
Like, I played a co-op game with Jeremy Todd 1 today, and yeah, it was pretty bad.
Like, I couldn't even...
and DarkSakura.com.
So that's pretty fun.
But the game itself is just really keeping my attention.
I'm hoping for some good download content later on because I think once I do finish the game and finally do get the rest of the achievements, it might just kind of crash for me because you need to have some really co-op stuff to be able to get a lot out of the game.
But it's fun so far, though.
I love it.
Then, of course, the typical Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories.
and my second PSP that I'm fixing.
It's all fixed now, but I have to order a new faceplate button for it because I bought the third party faceplate for it and it sucks balls.
So, always stick with first party stuff because the third party clear ones, they suck.
I think that's all I've really played other than, you know, just Crackdown.
So, yeah, kind of
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You can open your game up and then they can join it, but the inviting is broken.
So that's supposed to be fixed in a later patch.
So when are you going to let me play Crackdown so I can decide if it's worth the $60 or not?
Well, I still want to play it.
All right.
Well, you're going to come over at some point and show it to me, right?
I had it here today.
Because I didn't get the demo, quote-unquote.
I didn't get it.
I suck at those type of games.
Maybe you can see my save game where you can fire homing missiles at people.
All right.
Let's see, what else?
That's it for your gaming week?
That's it.
My gaming week was mostly World of Warcraft, as I said.
Kid Icarus.
A lot on Nintendo.
Dude, it's awesome.
It's hard as hell, but it's fun.
That's the hardest game ever.
Dude, when I beat the first dungeon this week, I thought I was the shit because I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm over 21 and I can still beat the first dungeon.
I still have some skill at this game.
Yes.
It was like getting to hear the theme.
How many people have actually heard other music in the game besides the very first stage?
Not a lot.
Exactly.
Most people have only heard the first stage music, so it's kind of neat to hear the second stage theme.
Anyway, I'm sure there's a lot of listeners that are like, I already beat the game, Rob.
What's taking you so long?
Yeah, I'm nine years old, and I beat the game like 500 times.
I'm doing it.
I was nine years old.
I beat the game 500 times, too.
But also, I used Icarus Fights Medusa Angels.
Anyway, also, I went to the arcade this week, which was kind of cool because I had a date Friday, and he actually wanted to go to the arcade because we didn't really have a set plan.
YoungSung is awesome
Uh-huh.
No, to answer chat, I do not have a boyfriend.
I think he listens to this once in a while.
I went on a date.
There's a big difference.
God, anyway.
I shouldn't talk about my personal life on this program.
Yeah, you shouldn't.
What else?
I really shouldn't.
Oh, I played Mario Kart Arcade, which was fun.
Because they fixed their machine at Golf Land, and now the picture camera thing works again.
It's a lot of fun.
I actually won the race.
I'm getting good at Mario Kart Arcade.
That must be on easy, too.
No, we played a normal track.
We didn't play the easiest one.
We played on normal.
No, I swear.
Yeah, but that game's a waste of money, man.
It's kind of hokey.
Mario Kart in the arcade does not nearly have the same magic as it does at home.
Why don't you just take a picture of yourself and, like, tape it to the screen if you really want your face on the thing?
It would be better if you had, like, eight of those machines.
Then it would be better with the pictures.
Like, I could see, like, a Dave & Buster's having all these machines next to each other.
In fact, I bet there's a Dave & Buster's somewhere that has it.
But when you only have two, it is kind of hokey.
and the game itself is not the same magic as the home.
It's really not.
It's like a whole different engine or something.
If you want to see the Mario Kart arcade, by the way, search for Orange Lounge on YouTube and there's a video of Loki playing Mario Kart drunk.
It's hilarious.
At his bachelor party.
Awesome.
Yeah.
We need to put more crap on YouTube.
Eddie, you're a camera person, right?
Yeah, I have a digital camera where we can download stuff.
Yeah.
Just took it up to the USB.
You need to do video.
You need to be like our official Orange Lounge videographer.
Seriously, yeah.
That's what I'll do.
That would be rad.
Let's do that.
It's on.
All right.
It's on.
All right.
Anyhow, let's go around and figure out some other gaming weeks.
Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
Oh, more wow.
Yep.
Good times on there.
Oh, I'm so happy because, like, my 29 Rogue on Elder Thales, I got some poor sap to give me a plus 15 agi on my dagger.
And that's kind of expensive.
Did you just call it agi?
Agility.
It's Agility.
Agility.
I call it Agi.
Agi is how you abbreviate it.
Agi is going to be a punch in your face.
Oh, Rice Princess, you make me lull.
Oh, Rob, DF, please.
Please.
Roltfulamow.
Roltfulamow.
Roltfulamow.
JK.
Anyway.
Oh, my gosh.
Now I'm going to leave.
No, but yeah, it's pretty much been wow, whoop-dee-doo, good wow times.
I played for about, I don't know, like an hour, hour and a half on Back Me Wool, and I did two quests.
I don't even know why I went on.
I'm like, man, and they were in the Barrens, so you know how you could do like ten quests at the same time in the Barrens?
I'm like, I'll just not do anything.
Because you got tied up in Barrens chat?
No, I got tied up in Gchat, yo.
Oh, I'm sorry, Guild Chat, let's not abbreviate that.
Yes, please, thank you.
Yeah, Guild Chat, sorry.
So, yeah.
Do you actually sign on to the Guild and go, what up, G?
No.
Oh, just curious.
Eddie, how was your gaming week?
It was awesome.
I've been doing the virtual console thing, too, so I got Donkey Kong Country.
Oh my god, that game still kicks ass.
I love that game.
Yeah, but it's not as good because I have GameCube controllers for my Wii instead of the classic controllers, and that doesn't work.
But it's still fun.
and DarkSakura.
Game Genie Code or something.
If you have a normal NES... Wasn't Rygar so hard because you couldn't save it?
Or you couldn't... Like, you had to do it in one sitting?
I don't think there was a... Yeah, you had to do it in... You had to do it in one sitting.
And you could only continue, I think, so many times, too.
Yeah.
So, it was pretty hard.
Yeah, that's how all games were back in the day, though.
Yeah, I guess.
Alright.
I'm looking at what's going on in chatroom.
Jvmon says, Sky, are you fucking with Rice Princess's volume?
Yes.
Sorry if you are noticing audio problems.
I'm fucking with her volume as she's talking because...
RicePrincess has a naturally quiet voice.
I'm trying to be loud.
Oh, man, am I, like, super loud now?
Like, can two people in China hear me now?
I think we're good.
But make sure if Loki talks, he uses this mic and not the one you're on.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right.
Because I guess the guys in studio have louder voices.
Anyway, not that you guys want to know that.
Eddie, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
Nope.
All right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Beat the Host Beat the Host
because it's going to be killer.
It's way harder than any of the others we've done, I think.
There's some that are easy, but some are hard.
But we'll get into that in part three.
I was like five years old when the arcade games were popular.
I know, so don't pick me.
You better pick Loki, I guess.
He might be the only challenge in here.
We'll see.
Or you can pick Rice Princess just to embarrass her with her lack of classic arcade knowledge.
So this will be fun.
All right, we'll see what happens.
That would suck.
All right.
Thank you for watching!
It's not a very well hidden secret.
It looks like a little text drawn smiley.
And what happens when you go into it, it's the Warp Zone.
And it's this new area on the Wii called the Nintendo Warp Zone.
And what the Warp Zone has is just like some trivia and cool stuff.
And right now what they have on there is some little Kirby trivia.
They have Kirby history and Kirby trivia, which would make sense because obviously the Kirby game... Did they get the Kirby game in Europe?
Released on their console yet?
I know we got it here.
But I'm assuming Kirby Europe, if they don't already have it, isn't far behind.
And that...
is kind of opening the potential to having this cool little, you know, Nintendo fan niche center that is possible to show up on the Wii.
And I'm betting if the UK has it, we're going to get it any day now here in the US.
Well, they also did a new channel.
They did the Everybody Votes channel.
That's last week's news, buddy.
Yeah, but whatever.
But they could have that on that, too.
Like, you could vote on, like, you know, different Nintendo trivia.
Well, that's what a lot of people are saying they should have done with the Everybody Votes channels.
They should have had Nintendo trivia and stuff.
Or, like, who do you like better?
Mario, Luigi, that type of thing.
and DarkSakura.com.
Right.
The music in the forecast channel is off.
Okay, obviously I'm reaching, I'm sorry.
JV Mon says, I use the weather channel.
GS68 is calling Loki the resident Wii hater.
I think that's not true.
Loki loves his Wii.
Right, yeah, I totally hate my Wii that I bought with, you know, tons of games and stuff.
Oh no, you didn't have to camp out because of distribution, but whatever.
That you got on launch day or before.
No, you had your Wii like three days before launch.
I remember going over there.
Mm-hmm.
playing that horrible, horrible Red Steel.
We didn't play Red Steel the first day, but you played it at the party, and that was awful.
It doesn't matter.
Nobody cares.
No, it's not okay with me.
It's a horrible game.
Horrible game.
No, just Red Steel, because Red Steel sucks balls.
Anyways, one thing that will not suck balls, hopefully, is going to be some Neo Geo and MSX games coming to
The Virtual Console, and, um, the first couple titles, at least the MSX titles, um, and this is gonna be on the Japanese service, of course, for right now.
Uh, Egi and Aleste are gonna be the first, um, MSX titles, and they're gonna be 800 Wii points each.
Then, both are due out in spring.
Um, hopefully we'll see some more, um, SNK stuff come over.
You know, personally, I'd hope that for, like, Magical Lord, and, um,
No Metal Slug, because my god, how many times have I read it?
Oh, I don't know.
How about Fatal Fury Special?
One of my favorite fighting games ever, next to Street Fighter.
Are you being sarcastic?
No, I fucking love Fatal Fury Special.
I like Fatal Fury.
I like King of Fighters.
Samurai Shodown.
They need Samurai Shodown, because that was great, too.
Yeah, or the best fucking game on Neo Geo ever, Magical Drop.
Or King of Monsters, I think.
Yeah, good times.
That's very interesting, because did they say that at launch, that they were going to partner with Neo Geo?
I don't think they did.
I remember hearing about MSX.
I remember MSX, which was very exciting, because a lot of people were going, ooh, now we can get the true sequel to Metal Gear and all that stuff that was only on the MSX, like the Metal Gear 2, not that Snake's Revenge stuff we had here in the US.
Or just being able to play the original Metal Gear in the MSX format might be kind of interesting.
They could retranslate it so that you don't have, you know, the truck have started to move.
No, they should keep that in there.
Yeah, probably, I don't know I'm not really familiar with the MSX too much, so I don't know
What was the name of that game?
Blue's Journey or Blue's Adventure or something like that?
Blue's Clues?
No!
We just figured out Blue's Clues.
You can get off the show now.
No, it was the one where he had... Never mind.
Nobody knows what I'm talking about.
Forget it.
Jerks.
What was I going to say?
What else on Neo Geo?
As long as we don't get 50,000 clones of Puzzle Bobble like there were in the arcade.
Every year there's a new Puzzle Bobble and it's always the same damn game.
It's the same thing.
Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of that.
Even though I love, like, puzzle games and stuff.
ShadowCharlie wants to see Super Baseball 2020.
Okay.
RobD wants to see King of Fighters 98.
Hell yeah.
Lots of King of Fighters games, too.
All the King of Fighters games.
But I don't mind seeing new ones of those every year.
Yeah, seriously.
That's awesome.
Yeah, they need to, like, keep making them.
Thank you.
HitStun remembers the translation.
I feel asleep.
It was I feel asleep.
That's awesome.
Thank you, HitStun.
Gold star for you.
Yep.
Alright, let's see.
Moving on with some other gaming news.
This, oh my gosh, this makes me so excited.
Square Enix is moving to put their first virtual console title on the Wii in Japan.
And if I tell you Square Enix is putting, unless you've already heard this, don't guess you've already heard, but if I told you Square Enix was putting a game on virtual console, what would you think it is?
Square Enix.
Like the original Final Fantasy, right?
That's what Eddie said in Final Fantasy?
Yeah.
Oh my god, what is it, Rob?
Oh my god!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And for those of you guys that are listening live tonight, you're actually going to get a treat during our break.
We can't play it on the podcast because of copyright, but you're going to get Actraiser music during the break tonight because I love it that much.
So, Sky, when's that coming out on Virtual Console?
Well, we don't know yet.
Exactly.
We know it's going to be March in Japan.
But that's a good sign that it'll probably make its way over here, like end of March, April.
That's awesome.
I'm so downloading this.
Actraiser...
Actraiser 2 wasn't even that bad.
It's just that they took out the simulation element of the game.
The simulation was fun.
I mean, it was like a Greek, you know, you were developing a Greek civilization or whatever.
But Actraiser, seriously, the only problem with Actraiser is that you can blast through the game in about four hours.
Well, maybe longer.
Maybe just about four hours.
I remember beating it when I rented it in one night.
That's pretty similar to a lot of old games.
I mean, especially NES games.
Like, you could get through them in a couple hours.
Yeah, so that's okay.
I'm so freaking excited.
That's awesome.
Actraiser 2 Actraiser 1
You had those, you know, side-scrolling action stages like the Ghosts and Goblins type theme with just this most beautiful music you've ever heard in a Super Nintendo game mixed with simulation scenes that are so different but they blend in the game so well because you get things in the simulation scene that you use in the action scene.
I mean, one of the all-time greatest games.
Seriously.
Okay, am I thinking of the right game where you're like an angel and you go and you like... Yes, you can see its little butt.
When you fly, yes, you can see its little angel butt.
Pervert, only you would know that.
I know.
You're like, oh, hot angel butt.
Yeah, that's, or like, I don't know, you're an angel and you're like planting crops or something like that, and you're like... Oh, really?
In the side scrollers, you're a god?
Is that what you said, Eddie?
Yes.
Okay.
That's great.
I guess I didn't play enough of it.
No, yeah, that was the whole theme of the game.
You were a god.
Oh.
And you had to go down to Earth to fix the suffering, and it's actually, actually, like, the music fits the emotion of the game, like, so well.
I'm sorry, I sound like such a ham, but it's true.
Like, it's one of the early, great
Did you cry?
No, not at that.
I did cry at a Super Nintendo game, though.
Which one?
Tell me.
I'm not telling you.
Tell me, damn it.
Tell me right now.
No.
I'm going to punch you in your face.
Final Fantasy 3.
Final Fantasy 2.
Oh, my God.
Was it because it was so bad?
No, because I beat it, and the ending was so great, and then I was sad because it was over.
You're like, finally, I beat a game in my life.
I was freaking like 12 years old, okay?
I wasn't like bawling.
I was like... It wasn't like when I saw Dancer in the Dark the first time, okay?
It was just like a little bit...
I'm sad it's over.
Tear, tear.
Alright, anyway.
Sorry.
Anyways, well, if ActRaiser isn't your cup of tea, there's going to be some more stuff coming from Sega.
Seriously, I want you to unsubscribe from this show.
If ActRaiser is not your cup of tea, you do not deserve to listen to... No, I'm kidding.
Obviously, I'm kidding.
There goes all of our listeners.
Bye, guys.
It's nice knowing you.
Anyways, some new titles from Sega.
We're going to see Sword of a Million, Vector Man, Sonic Spinball, and Beyond Oasis.
So those should be coming within the next couple weeks.
And there was also some other stuff I was just reading here last minute from Hudson that was coming out on the Virtual Console, and these are also kind of exciting.
You're going to be getting Double Dungeons and Splatterhouse in March.
Oh, God, Splatterhouse.
Dude, Phantasy Star, for real?
Yeah.
Yeah, Phantasy Star's coming out, too, for Virtual Console.
That's awesome.
Where'd you hear that?
From the Internet.
Sonic Spinball
because he mentioned it, is one of those games, like, complete opposite end from Actraiser, okay?
It's one of those games that, like, you remember as being really cool.
Like, you know, oh, it's Sonic, it's a pinball game, and oh, I remember this game was just so awesome.
And then you play it for five minutes and you go, God, this shit's boring.
Isn't it?
Is it just me?
No, it's kind of like you, like, when I go around you and then you start talking to me for about five minutes, I'm like, I want to go home.
Except not really, because I love you, Rob Hearts, to you.
This will be the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio you ever hear.
Bye.
Speaking of people that shouldn't be talking more than five minutes at a time, Perrin Kaplan.
Open her mouth about some new things going on the Wii.
By the way, I believe Perrin Kaplan also said that the GameCube had been ceased production, that there's no more GameCubes, right?
And then it came out later in the week that, oh, just kidding, we really haven't stopped making the GameCubes.
I think Perrin Kaplan is kind of like, I kind of treat her like opposite woman.
Like when she says something, the opposite is actually true.
It's this clever marketing ploy.
Yeah, anytime she talks, it's like, oh, introduction to the opposites.
DVD playback enabled on it.
Oh my god.
Who cares?
What do you mean, oh my god?
How many DVD players do you have in your house?
Three or four.
So do you need another one on the Wii?
I don't think so.
Who cares?
Bring the pink Wii out already.
I don't think anyone's not buying the Wii because it doesn't have DVD playback.
I know that's just a stupid feature anyways.
I mean, it's kind of thrown in because they're DVD-ROM drives.
Might as well just put the codecs in there.
Yeah, that was popular like five years ago when nobody had a DVD, and now it's like, eh.
Exactly.
So, I mean, the GameCube didn't really play DVDs, so...
Who gives a shit?
Looking at our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, SpeedyF40 says, the GameCube will live on forever.
Well, yeah, because the Wii will play all your GameCube games.
So, I mean, seriously, when I heard that the GameCube was going away, I was like, well, that makes sense.
But the best part about the Wii playing the GameCube games, and I always have to explain this to my customers that are renting out GameCube games for the Wii and stuff, if you don't have GameCube controllers, you're fucked.
I, third-party controllers.
I'm just saying.
Uh, let's see, Actdeft says, who the hell listens to Perrin Kaplan?
Okay, look, show me five gaming blogs that did not run the story this week, okay?
That run stories on Nintendo, usually.
The thing is, is that whatever she says makes it onto every major gaming blog out there, so.
And for some reason we posted that as well.
Uh, Joshi16 says, she is a classic Contrary Mary.
I've never heard that term before.
Wow.
Contrary Mary.
Contrary, Contrary Mary, I guess I'm putting it.
Contrary Mary?
The emphasis on the wrong syllable.
Did somebody say Contra?
What, did somebody say Contra?
No, Contrary.
Let's see, what else is there?
Let's see, FootyMonster... No, I'm sorry, who said it was a selling point?
Damn it, somebody in chat room, I'm sorry, whoever said it.
Oh, FootyMonster did say it.
It doesn't matter, Sky, it's a selling point, talking about the DVD playback.
Yeah, just like... I don't know, who cares, really?
Well, they, I don't know...
Fix their online!
That'd be great, let's fix the online, something that we're actually going to use instead of... Let's make DVD playback.
All in time.
Yeah, okay, we've established that you're the only one that the messages don't download when it's off.
No, it doesn't work for me either.
It works for me, because I'm cooler than you.
Maybe because you have that USB, you have a dongle.
You use your dongle, and the dongle makes it all work.
It does look like a penis for... It does quite look like a penis for the computer.
Anyway, moving right along.
Anyways, so...
If you're looking forward to more independent games on the Wii, they have this big program that they were touting originally, saying that they were going to fund a bunch of independent games.
This whole independent developer program in which they would give them free development kits and that kind of stuff.
Well, the only problem is they don't have enough development kits to go around.
Apparently, they're also in short supply just like the actual Wii's are.
So, a lot of these independent developers aren't going to get to make their crappy ports of games that they probably already released.
Well, the sad part of that is, though, for those that were wondering, where are the downloadable indie games on the virtual console?
They haven't even... They're just a... They're a twinkle in mommy's eye right now because there's no dev kits.
That's it.
What?
What?
Nevermind.
on the Wii.
Yes, it's a game where you shoot chickens.
Dude, if it's like Duck Hunt with chickens, sold.
Oh my god, chicken shit.
They can instantly sell that title if they just change it to Cock Shoot.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Who are you?
Oh, by the way, this is LankyStyle.
Long time no hearer.
Long time listener.
Long time listener, first time caller.
Now, you've been on the show before, but not in its podcast form, so nobody knows who you are, in other words.
Okay, well, I'm just the nameless voice.
Well, wait, really quickly.
Your three favorite games of all time and why?
Really quickly.
So we know what type of gamer you are.
Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger, and... Chicken Shoot.
No, Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
All right, there you have it.
I do cosplay.
No, I'm kidding.
You know, he's a big fan of ActRaiser.
He played Act... You just missed it.
ActRacer's coming to Virtual Console in Japan.
Oh, I know.
I got a boat or two.
All right.
Ew.
So, yeah.
That's it.
No development kits for the poor independent folks, you know.
Poor them.
They can't get free development kits.
Aww.
QQ.
GS68 says, crack shoot.
How about instead of chicken shoot?
If they bring out chicken shoot, I think there should be another mode in it.
Like, you remember how a duck hunt had the duck shoot and then they had the skeet shooting?
Clay shooting, yeah.
They should have chicken shoot and waffle shoot.
SpeedyF40 wants to see Cockblock for the Wii.
Interesting tie.
Isn't that, what was that PSP game that we played?
Cockblock for the Wii.
What was that PSP game we played at the Konami?
Brooktown.
Isn't that kind of what?
What?
Forget it.
No.
That's just one of those games that's like, I'm so popular in the fictional high school.
If only it were true in real life.
Stick it in the game.
Stick it in the game.
No, stick it in, comma, the game.
Get it?
Nevermind, like Oonga Boonga That doesn't even make sense, you wouldn't even put a comma there Stick it in!
That's on WarioWare, Smooth Moves Is there a minigame on WarioWare, Smooth Moves, that's Stick It In?
No, you stick in the game Remember that one where you pushed it on the Super Nintendo game?
Nevermind Alright, moving on, anyway, um
Speaking of the Wii, since we have a lot of Wii news tonight, this is also noteworthy, because Wiis are still very hard to find, yet they have outsold the 360 and the PlayStation 3 in January, and this is some preliminary data that made its way onto the internet.
The Wii sold 436,000 units, 360, 294,000 units, PlayStation 3, 244,000 units.
So it's only 50,000 units separating 360 and PlayStation 3.
Then again, 360's been on the market for a year, so it doesn't look too good for Sony.
Sony might need some games to come out pretty soon to rescue them, but who knows what's going to happen.
Motorstorm's coming out in a couple weeks, and I cannot wait to play that average racing game.
But it's still fun.
It looks awesome.
Is it on the show world tonight?
I don't think we put Qbert or Flo or that stuff.
So I guess we could take a moment to mention that Qbert and Flo made its way to the... Yeah, I heard Qbert sucks and Flo is short.
I heard they redid Qbert.
And I heard it sucks.
Really?
I like Qbert.
I want to play it.
Will you download it?
Can I come over and play it?
I don't know if I want to waste that kind of money.
Oh, come on.
You bought a PlayStation 3.
Oh, wait, you didn't buy the PlayStation 3.
You bought games for the PlayStation 3.
I know.
You bought Ridge Racer 7 when you already had it when it was called Ridge Racer 6.
I know, and it still sucks!
And I bought Full Auto 2, and it's still Full Auto 1.
They just put it in new packaging and added a crappy deathmatch mode, and I was a sucker.
And I bought that crap.
You're getting some compliments tonight.
Sasha says Loki is great this evening.
And FootyMonster says Loki is picking up the slack for DarkSakura tonight.
He's like double pissed off.
I'm not pissed off, it's just...
I hate these games that they put out at launch, and they call it a sequel, and it's really not a sequel.
It's just, it's like fucking, it's like, a perfect example is, for the Wii, coming out next month, Prince of Persia Rival Swords.
It's fucking Two Thrones, all over again.
All you need to do is tack on some stupid controls to it, and added chariot racing.
Ooh, woohoo!
Chariot racing?
That was the only thing that was missing from the first one.
Oh god, I really wish there was chariot racing in this.
They got my letters.
Yes.
Raven's Dolphin in the chat room says, Flo is a beautiful screensaver.
Yeah, that's what I hear.
It's a screensaver that moves.
That's all the reviews I've heard.
Like, it's After Dark, the game.
Listen.
Okay.
Listen, Sony.
Stop making games that utilize this stupid tilt functionality crap.
Because, to be honest, they're not that great.
I mean...
Flow, okay, that's kind of cool, you know, because it was a cool web game when it was free and stuff.
But this, like, Super Rub-a-Dub or whatever it's coming out with the ducks, it's the same damn game again.
It's just like that other game that was out there right now that's kind of a clone of Geometry Wars.
That one sucks, too.
Stop releasing games.
It's just a stupid gimmick.
JeremyTodd1 in chat has some advice for Sony.
This is sure to make the Sony fanboys very pleased.
JeremyTodd1 says, I got an idea for what Sony should do.
I think Sony should go ride the rollercoaster of death right into the lake of fire, doom and torture, where its eyes will get ripped, and then they're forced to eat the eyes with a broken fork where they will continually watch bad TV shows over and over.
You can address those cards and letters to JeremyTodd1, care of Orange Lounge Radio.
Anyways, so more happy stuff, though.
Elite Beat Agents is getting a sequel, which isn't too surprising because the game is pretty awesome.
Um, so, definitely... Actually, it is surprising, because the game didn't sell as well as they thought it would, especially not in Japan.
Yeah, but it's Nintendo, they're not going to come up with anything original.
I mean, come on, they still got... What?
Are you smoking crack?
What is the Wii?
What is the Wii?
What do you mean Nintendo's not going to come up with something original?
Okay, let me see here.
Another Super Mario sequel, another Metroid sequel, another Donkey Kong sequel.
Woo!
That's brand new shit!
I think we got a Wii latest here.
Anyways, so Elite Beat Agents with yet more, you know, some different music because this is the natural progression of your, you know, music games is let's get some different music.
They're not really specifying a release date yet, but they're saying that the new game is going to have four-player action and it's going to have a new snappy title.
All right.
So I cannot wait for this game.
But they're saying that the Japanese version is getting a sequel.
We don't know about American yet, right?
No word on the U.S.
yet.
But, you know, if it's coming out in Japan, they're going to translate it, so... Well, I mean, they didn't really translate Owen Don.
They kind of gave us a whole new version that was, I think, better.
But, you know, depends what kind of music you're into.
Anyway, Eddie is dying over here.
He wants to share some Wii news that wasn't on our show roll.
Yeah, there's an unconfirmed rumor on the internet, which is always reliable...
The Nintendo's going to come out with sensor ankle straps so you can kick and dance and kick.
That's a bunch of bullshit.
I think that'd be awesome.
Even if it's not true, if it was true, that'd be awesome.
That'd be so cool.
Can anybody say Sega Activator?
Sega Activator.
That's pretty easy.
I think that'd be cool.
I don't know.
You could run and jump and do it.
And do it.
SSJ100 Matt in chat says that's fake.
Ooh, shot down.
Ouch.
They do have the penis sensor light.
Sweet.
Dead air.
I just wanted to point out, though, Loki, the Nintendo fanboy train is going by, and, you know, you're not on it.
Oh, sick burn, Rob.
Come on.
Come on, Loki, get on the Wii fanboy train.
Why don't we give him, like, a fucking, you know, soundboard, because we'd have stuff like this.
No, yeah, because, no, Loki actually is a Nintendo... He likes Nintendo.
I went over to his video game party.
It was, like, all Nintendo, pretty much.
I mean, so he's not against Nintendo.
Come on, now.
I'm picking up, you know, SSX Blur next week.
That's going to be awesome.
I'm really looking forward to that.
But, to be honest, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Stop releasing old ass games under a new title because they're on the portable systems now and on the Wii.
It's just a port of some old game that was out before.
Listen, it didn't sell well the first time.
Stop trying to port it over to get some more sales out of it.
Especially, do we really need another port of Driver Parallel Lines?
I mean, wasn't it bad enough the first time and now you have to...
Enhance it with some better controls
It's so cool.
Why the fuck, okay, why the fuck is he posting that in his blog and the other thing is, why the fuck are people posting it in their blogs?
Like saying, dude, did you hear the guy from IGN?
He heard that there's news coming that's cool.
What the fuck is that?
Oh my god, you guys, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is coming to PartnerNet, but you didn't hear it from me.
That missed our show role too, you know?
Owl thing.
Even though we're not supposed to talk about it, dude, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is totally on PartnerNet.
Rob, is this like the same guy that was the t-shirt dude from two weeks ago?
Yeah, I think maybe.
Wow, that's pretty crazy because you do the voice exactly the same.
That's my uniformed straight male voice, actually.
Oh, wow, you do it really well.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Dude, Rice Princess, give me a beer and make me a pie, bitch.
I'm going to say, you know, a lot of the stuff that's on PartnerNet that people go and report about, it's not really...
I saw that that Jetpack game that they've already announced is on PartnerNet.
Wow, you didn't announce the game.
You didn't give me any details about the game.
All you said is you're confirming something that they've already announced.
Wow, that's awesome.
Guess what?
WarioWare Smooth Moves, it's in stores now.
I just confirmed something that they've already announced.
Give me my own blog.
Joshi16 says, Attention, Loki.
It's all about attention.
Let's see, what else is there here?
NintendoManiac64 says, Breaking news.
There's news coming.
GS68 says, Loki, free speech, anyone?
Fine, but I don't have to listen to them.
Alright, well, anyhow, we should move on to another story here, and this is like this ongoing saga.
Like, I thought we would have talked about this once on the show, laughed, and it would be done with, and I'm talking about level 30.
And you know when I say level 30, I'm talking about Bubble Bobble DS.
Oh god.
BUBBLE BOBBLE REVOLUTION
You get a free copy of Rainbow Islands Revolution.
Because I didn't even know there was a Rainbow Islands Revolution.
I did in no way.
And I actually played the old school Rainbow Islands.
I still play it today on GameTap.
And I could care less that there's this DF version out.
And if I'm a Rainbow Islands fanboy and don't give a shit about this DS release, I can't imagine there's five people who bought this game.
Therefore, you're getting this free game because nobody else wanted it.
They have extra copies sitting in the warehouse.
So...
Does this atone for their sins?
It's all well with Codemasters now because they give you a free game.
I mean, you gotta say, they didn't have to do that.
Let me just put it this way.
They should really fire their marketing people because that cover for Bubble Revolution or whatever looks like crap.
I mean, those dinosaurs look really fucked up.
Jesus, did they gain like a thousand pounds or something?
Like Jenny Craig, anyone?
There's a nice little letter that came with it.
Thank you for watching!
Also for the Nintendo DS, so there's only one.
So, oh, great.
Oh, great.
So I got, you know, my Bubble Bobble wouldn't go to level 30, and now there's only one goddamn island in Rainbow Island.
Okay, wait.
We've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island.
You know why they included Rainbow Islands, right?
Why?
Because Bubble Bobble really only goes up to 31.
So they're like, oh, you're going to be done after 31.
People are going to believe you, Rice Princess.
Yeah, because I work for them.
Anyway, we've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island as consideration for the length of time that you had to wait for the new cartridges to be manufactured.
Please dispose of your faulty cartridge by simply putting it in the trash or local recycling facility where one exists.
You know why it's called Rainbow Island?
Because they didn't finish the rest of the levels and you're going to have to send it in to get the rest of them.
You know what you need to fucking do with that replacement cartridge?
Return it to your local GameStop and get some money back because they're not going to know the difference.
They got it.
Come on.
They're not dumb enough to buy it.
Yeah, they are.
There's got to be some way they can tell.
No, they're not.
Okay, fine, take it back to your local, whatever, used game store.
Alright, well, stories about Bubble Bobble Revolution going on four weeks in a row make me very angsty, and I don't know about you, but that makes me want to bring on the pain with the FUs of the week.
Loki, since DarkSakura is not here tonight, I will put in a preemptive DarkSakura FU to traffic and people and how she's busy with massage school and all that crap.
Alright, Loki, what's your FU tonight?
I don't really have an FU, but I'm going to take this moment to let everyone in on a huge secret.
There is some uber huge exciting news coming soon.
And I tell you, once you hear what this news is, it's going to fucking blow your mind.
It's so amazing.
I really wish I could tell you, but I can't.
You know, NDAs and all.
I like how they follow the NDAs when it comes to that news, but when it comes to everything else, you just kind of go, what NDA?
You know why?
Because there's no news.
This is the same guy that said there's fucking Halo on the Game Boy Advance.
I mean, come on.
Oh my god, there is?
Oh my god, burn your Gameboy or Ice Princess.
Oh, unsubscribe, unsubscribe.
I would like to give an F you to Whoppers, the original malted milk balls, because they are so addicting.
And I think my roommate did a bunch of them when I wasn't here, so F you to that.
Don't steal my Whoppers when I'm not here.
Give me my malted milk balls.
How dare you take my malted milk balls.
Eddie.
Eddie.
I'd like to say an F you to all the garbage that I've been keeping in my closet because I'm moving and I have to throw it away now and I'm like, ah!
Because it's taking forever and it's horribly bad.
F you, garbage in my closet!
What else do you have in your closet?
Nothing!
Rice Princess.
You already came out.
F you to the auction house on Elder Palace because you're stupid and you'd never have good leather headgear.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
But I call it, let's QQ more poo-poo, because it's funner to say, I don't know.
What does even pew-pew mean?
Like shooting?
Like pew-pew!
But what if you're a warrior, you don't really shoot?
Then punch yourself in the face, why the fuck are you playing a warrior?
Warriors are lame.
You should be playing a rogue or a hunter.
Anything else?
No, that's it.
Lanky style, do you have anything you wish to contribute?
F you the Taco Bell, because it makes more poo-poo.
Yeah, more poo-poo, less QQ.
In that case... Ew.
Ew, ew.
Speaking of things that are pretty poo-poo, in my opinion, Alien Hamed is coming to Xbox 360.
Sorry, I did not like Alien Hominid.
XBOX Live Talk to 1UP Wing Commander Arena
and nobody cares because it looks like shit.
I don't know if anyone's seen the videos out there, but the Wing Commander that you've known and loved or maybe didn't like, this is certainly not the same game.
In fact, this is as much Wing Commander as Novodrome was Twisted Metal.
So, I don't know.
But anyways, if you're interested, it's 16 players online and you can battle each other.
That might be cool.
No.
Well, come on.
I mean, even though the game did not look like Wing Commander, like if you've seen the little game preview, somebody took the Wing Commander license and put it on some, like, random space shooter game.
But 16 people, come on.
That's gotta be fun.
Was Novodrome fun with 16 people?
Novodrome, no, you're right.
Novodrome was just not a fun game at all.
Anyway, so, it is coming out.
It's gonna have, you know, up to 16 players.
They're gonna have free-for-all maps, duly maps, team maps, blah, blah, blah.
And...
Yeah, it's great.
There's videos online, YouTube, GameTrailers.com, so check it out and be disappointed.
Apparently Boom Boom Rocket is really anticipated by a lot of folks in chat room.
That looks fun.
It does look fun.
See, I like DDR, and I did like Fantavision, so... Our old buddy Mel B's in chat and says it's like Dance Mania Speed meets Fireworks.
That's what Boom Boom Rocket is.
I want to see a...
Video of that in motion.
We see screenshots, but screenshots only tell you so much.
You know, that would be kind of fun to play Def Jam Icon with Dance Mania Speed as the custom soundtrack in that.
Any game with Dance Mania Speed as the custom soundtrack is sure to be hilarity.
Something that's not funny is my Xbox 360.
It makes too damn much noise whenever I'm playing it.
And apparently, though, there is a rumor going around because, you know, when websites that are foreign...
Release News, which is the case of this German website.
It's only a rumor.
The US websites won't believe it until Microsoft announces it.
Because they can't read it.
Well, whatever.
But anyway, it certainly sounds like it could be a possibility.
A German gaming website, what was it called?
Cinemite.de or Cinemite, I don't know.
They announced that Microsoft has done a software update for debug Xbox 360s that reduces the speed of the DVD drive, causing the noise to go down.
But the drive is slower then.
Yeah, but did it need all the high speeds?
Yes.
Well, don't you think the update is smart enough to know, hey, when you need the high speed, use high speed.
When you don't need it, shut up.
Does anyone really care how loud the DVD drive is?
Because, to be honest, I don't really notice mine when I'm playing games.
And if you're sitting there going, damn, my drive is loud, then you're going to die.
I'm going to be honest.
I do notice it.
Especially when you boot the system.
Like, when you boot and you're starting a game, that's when I really notice it.
I'm like, god damn, is my Xbox 360 going to launch into space?
Because it makes so much noise.
It's like...
Don't you think they make up... Maybe it's just because mine's vertical standing?
I don't know.
I think because yours is on a hard surface, and so it transfers the sound.
But, I mean, if you put it on carpet, like I have mine right now, I was playing on my monitor on my computer, and so I have it sitting on next to my normal PC, and I don't really hear it.
I mean, I don't know.
But then again, I have headphones on, and I'm listening to the music and stuff, so... But...
Whatever, I don't know.
It's not a big deal for me.
I mean, if it was like, like the whole time when you're playing it, then that would be a little different, but... That would just be really weird if they did that.
It's not the millions of unsubscribed clicks you were getting throughout the world.
I mean, so it's not a huge deal, though.
It's not like a chainsaw sound or something like that.
I don't know.
People just need to quit bitching.
SpeedyF40, OuchEars, GS68, LokiWTF, AlphaCanogram, DamnLoki...
Loki needs a sedative.
I was going to say, Eddie was making fun of me calling my wireless headset a wireless communicator at one point, but I wanted to say during my gaming week, I bought one of those $20 things that you can put in your computer, what's it called, the gaming receiver or something like that, so you can use your wireless headset.
It's awesome, because I can use my wireless headset on Ventrilo, and I didn't have to do any configuration on my computer.
Ventrilo just automatically knew, and the voices come through on the ear, and you can talk.
with the headset.
It's great.
We should just buy a bunch of those and all do the show with that.
Yeah, just do the show with that.
You know, it's too bad, Rob, because the Ventrilo server doesn't work anymore, so you never go on.
And Rob puts on a red mini Uhura skirt and goes, all hailing frequencies open, Captain, for lovin'.
Nobody even understands that.
It's from Star Trek.
Thousands of listeners of Warren's, I'm sorry, hundreds of listeners after tonight, actually maybe 20 listeners of Warren's on radio after tonight, and not a one of them is going to understand that at all.
Very well.
Anywho, one thing that's never quieting down is these stupid rumors about Metal Gear Solid 4 on the 360.
And yet another one fanning the flames of this rumor.
There's apparently a...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and also on this survey, do you like candy?
Do you like money?
Because as Captain Obvious' survey, of course people want to see Metal Gear Solid on the 360, right?
I mean, the more games, the better?
Lanky Star, you're shaking your head.
Why not?
Because I hate the Xbox 360.
That's a great reason.
Why do you hate the 360?
I don't hate it.
I don't hate it, but it's not as good as like a DS or a Wii.
Why?
Reasons?
Titles.
That's what matters.
360 has got a lot of shit coming out.
I mean, I don't know.
A lot of it's good, you know, exclusive titles.
Boom Boom Rocket.
Is it like Boom Boom Fire?
Boom Boom Dollar?
No, I'm going to get one only for the Mistwalker titles because I'm a big OG Final Fantasy fanboy.
Blue Dragon.
Yes.
Blue fucking Dragon.
Blue Dragon looks awesome and so does Lost Odyssey.
Lost Odyssey's a ways off.
It's not... Hopefully it won't be a lost cause.
No, but anyways, this comes from apparently an Evil Avatar forum post, so... Take that as rumor, I guess.
To be honest, I don't believe that such survey exists, but, you know... Evil Avatar's another all-game show, so we gotta show a little love.
I'm just saying, but this is like a listener.
This isn't exactly, you know... But, whatever, I mean... It's possible that they're...
Do they really need to ask people what their interest is in Metal Gear Solid 4?
I mean, that's like, would you like to see Halo 3?
I mean, it's dumb.
Shadowslayer says, my god, a survey, amazing, it's confirmed.
I think that was a little bit of sarcasm there.
Speaking of obvious, it sounds like Crackdown 2 has already been greenlit, and that gets a big fat duh as well.
Um...
I mean, maybe it'll contain the Halo 4 beta.
That was the joke.
Yeah, I read that joke.
Yeah, I stole a joke from whatever the site, QJ or whatever.
But I mean, come on, it doesn't take a lot of brains to come up with that joke.
Isn't that the only reason why Crackdown's really selling the Halo 3 beta?
I think a lot of people are actually buying it for the game because it's a fun game.
It's a lot of fun.
And I mean, if it were just for the Halo 3 beta, then you wouldn't see a lot of people playing the game right now because...
Halo 3 Beta isn't out.
A more believable functioning city.
The city makes the fun.
I think it comes to how you choose and approach your missions and so on and so on.
Well, the thing is about Crackdown and they even were talking about when they were designing the game originally, they've made it to where they can add islands and add whole extra parts of the city that aren't in the full game right now later on.
So this game can expand almost as much as like Oblivion can.
So...
I hope they go that route.
That'd be really cool.
Chatroom is shooting down the whole Halo.
I stand corrected, apparently.
DDRDollarBill says, I liked Crackdown.
Fuck Halo 3 Beta.
JeremyTodd1 says, I could care less about the Halo 3 Beta.
Crackdown is amazing as a game.
And DDRDollarBill confirms again, Crackdown is more fun than fucking Halo.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm going to play the Halo 3 Beta because I'm going to be able to play the Halo 3 Beta, but...
I don't know.
I'm not too excited about it.
I think it's just going to be... Everyone's going to be, I think, disappointed because there's been a lot of people who have done it really good so far and there's not really much you can innovate on.
And this, you know, big secret X button crap or whatever that is, I don't think it's going to be that big deal.
So, whatever.
We shall see.
Anyways.
So another thing that's going to be shown pretty soon is going to be Xbox 360's IPTV service, and they're actually showing it at the Connected Home show at, well, in Europe, of course, a brand new show down there.
And it looks interesting, not really too much, you know, they don't really go into any details on it, but I guess it's going to have DVR stuff in there as well.
Anything that can give me more TV channels, I'm all for.
So, you know,
I can't wait to check this out.
All right.
I'm curious about it, but I don't like the fact that you have to switch everything to do it.
I'm not going to switch everything just to have TV on my 360, you know what I mean?
Apparently it's going to be taking place, though, the Connected Home Show, and that's March 5th through 7th in Olympia, London.
I'd like to see some YouTubage of it in motion.
I don't know.
Anyhow, something else very cool announced to the Xbox 360, price cuts for the games!
Yay!
Actually, not all the games.
It's the Platinum Hit series, but you know.
We all like news on a price cut.
And actually, a lot of those are already price cut.
Have already been price cut, huh?
Yeah, they just don't have the new packaging.
Well, supposedly March 16th is the day that the new packaging will come out, but it sounds like a lot of retailers have been proactive about the price.
Yeah, they've already dropped the pricing.
Well, for the low, low price of $30, you can get Battlefield 2, Burnout Revenge, Call of Duty 2, Dead or Alive 4, Fight Night Round 3, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, Top Spin 2, or Rockstar Games Table Tennis, which I seem to recall only cost $39 in the first place.
Yeah.
So it's not much of a price cut.
And Top Spin 2 sucks balls.
Don't buy it.
Call of Duty 2, Battlefield, etc.
Burnout, but Chromehounds as well and Perfect Dark Zero.
And other regions in Asia also get 99 nights, which should be interesting.
Chromehounds, I do believe, has already dropped down in price in the United States as well.
So, I mean...
You can probably find that if you really... But keep in mind, if you want to have the best tanks in the game or whatever, the best mechs, whatever you call them, you have to buy extra stuff online.
Just wait for Armored Core 4 because this is the game that you should have bought in the first place anyways.
I was a sucker, also bought Chromehounds thinking, oh, it's going to be just like Armored Core.
It's like Armored Core with anchors being dragged behind you.
It's so slow and boring.
Armored Core 4 is the way to go.
Anyways...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's like a big duh.
So that game is going to be coming out.
Mercenaries, if you don't remember, originally I believe was put out by LucasArts.
And it was one of those games that you can... I remember the commercial actually for it.
They're all, you know, shoot people, blow stuff up again, you know.
It's kind of one of those sandbox type of games where you can just cause a lot of mayhem.
So I will definitely be checking it out.
And it's set for fall, by the way.
A game that I will definitely check out is Elder Scrolls V, because you know there's going to be one on the way.
And Elder Scrolls IV was obviously an amazing game.
Bethesda has confirmed Elder Scrolls V will happen.
It's definitely going to happen.
There's no immediate plans right now, according to the studio's vice president of PR and marketing, Pete Hines.
But what else is interesting is that he says the possibility of an MMO is kind of a natural step for the series.
Um, very interesting.
Uh, but what's interesting about that, uh, it's been bounced around, according to Heinz, but, uh, they will not move forward with it unless there's a fresh idea for the MMO genre.
But, dude, I think opening up Oblivion as an MMO would, you know, or that type of game as an MMO is good enough, don't you think?
I mean, God, when that multiplayer patch hit, most people were like, this should have just been in the game to begin with.
It's gonna be crazy, though.
It'll be interesting.
I don't know, I can't wait.
But you know you're not going to see this game until 2009 at the earliest.
I mean, it's going to be when people are talking about PlayStation 4 and Xbox 720, whenever that happens.
Or whatever the fuck else they're going to call it.
Yeah, we'll see.
Anyways...
So, with Clover being dissolved, some of the members, of course, went on to create the brand new company, Seed.
The other members stuck around and are now working for Capcom.
Well, what are they working on?
You're going to be seeing them working on Resident Evil 5, for one, and, of course, a brand new Wii game, as well.
So, it's kind of nice to see Clover, because I know they were doing a lot of original IPs and stuff, and kind of
Throwing that kind of creative side to Resident Evil 5.
Hopefully this Wii game, that's pretty awesome.
It's pretty sweet.
Interesting.
So I guess Clover, not as far gone as some people think.
Well, they're gone, but it's like if you buy a company or something like that, a lot of times you'll dissolve the company and just say, okay, whoever wants to move over, we'll pay you to move over.
Otherwise...
Find a new job.
It's kind of like that.
You pretty much keep the same people, but... Yeah, you get the talent, but you don't have to pay for the spot, the lease or whatever.
You're just cutting costs that way.
Well, that was the last story we had paid for Part A, but we're actually running a little early tonight, so I think we'll actually go to the Skype line and take some calls.
I covertly opened up the Skype line there and saw if we'd get any calls.
So we'll get some calls out of the way early a little bit tonight, because we're running early tonight.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
How you doing, Sky?
I'm SpeedyF40.
Hi, SpeedyF40.
I don't recognize the name.
You must be a new listener.
I'm not a new listener because I've been listening to the podcast forever.
Awesome.
Brand new on the stream, though.
Well, welcome.
Welcome to the first show.
I guess live show.
Is this the first live show you're doing, then?
Yeah, first live show I'm doing.
I've popped my Orange Lounge cherry tonight.
Sweet.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Was it hot?
Was it as good for you as it was for me?
I'm sure it was probably better for you because I tried harder, but I'm sure it worked out for everybody.
Speedy, what kind of games are you into?
Well, right now I'm playing Star Wars Deadly Alliance or something for the PSP because I got it through Gamefly and it's mildly entertaining.
But I'm playing some WoW and some Wii games, even though I got a topic for you.
Alright, what's up?
I think the Wii is overrated.
Oh, Gasp, you're on Loki's side tonight.
So you are not on the train tonight with everybody else.
You're not on the Wii fanboy train.
Yeah, I... Oh, God.
Just kidding.
Yeah, I'm not on the fanboy train.
I think that the Wii is completely overrated because...
Okay, I think it's just more of a party system, a fad system, if you will.
I have a Wii, I bought it the day it came out, and I'm missing my gaming experience.
I've been going to the PC more and more often.
But, Ian, what's interesting, do you think the Wii is going the way of the GameCube?
Because I even, I love Nintendo, I would have paid the GameCube very similarly.
Although you had some phenomenal games on GameCube, you know, Resident Evil 4, it was mostly a party system.
Your Mario Parties, your Smash Bros.
Melees, you know, it was a party system.
I don't think it'll go the way of the GameCube because it has that quirkiness and it has games like, oh gosh, Warriorware, which is a really fun game.
Definitely kudos to them for doing that one.
But I think that a serious gamer would be better off with the Xbox 360.
So you don't think the uber-cool Metroid or, no, no, the uber-cool super-secret thing the IGN guy won't shut up about, you don't think that's going to change your mind?
No, I don't think a DVD drive or anything like that is going to change my mind at all.
See, I totally disagree, because on the Twilight Princess, I think that was a perfect marriage of classic, sort of old-school styling with combining some of the wee elements to make it more immersive.
Oh, give me a break.
Twilight Princess sucked.
It was not as good as it could have been.
It was developed for the GameCube, and it showed.
Definitely showed.
Yeah, but I think it showed that it can do a classic-style game and still be awesome.
It could do a classic style game when it's a freaking port.
I think that Twilight Princess was entertaining because it was Zelda, but I don't think it was any better than any other platformer could have been.
There was no huge breakthrough.
You know, our chat room, very polarized on the same topic.
Jvmon says Twilight Princess was overrated.
ShadowNextGen says, I love Twilight Princess.
Jvmon also says, Twilight Princess showed fanboys will love anything.
You know what?
I like Wind Waker a lot better.
What?
You're smoking crack!
I was like, well, why the fuck did they just not make it like a remake of, you know, Link to the Past or something like that with that kind of style of graphics?
This coming from the person who was criticizing Nintendo early in the show for doing too damn many remakes.
Huh?
Okay.
Pwned!
No, here's what I'm saying, though.
I don't necessarily want them to do an actual remake, but I just wanted it to actually be in Hyrule instead of in the ocean.
I mean, because I would have rather had, you know, more land and stuff like that and run around like that.
I don't mind the art style.
I thought it was kind of different.
You know, you got used to it, and it kind of worked.
It's just... And then, now I'm playing, you know, Twilight Princess, and I lost interest in like an hour, so...
Same here, Loki.
Same here.
I don't get it.
I don't get why everyone brings us a 10.
It wasn't that great.
Did you play through the whole game, though?
Twilight Princess?
Yeah.
No, I... Well, if the game sucks, Eddie, you're not going to play through it.
No, yeah, no, the first... I mean, the story doesn't really start developing right away, though.
I mean, once you get into it, I mean, it's like... It's the first... To me, it's the only true sequel to Ocarina of Time.
I mean, once you get into it, like, it's really cool.
They start touching base with all the old Ocarina of Time stuff.
I didn't even care about Ocarina of Time, though.
See, that's a thing.
Oh, wow.
See, you're not even a Zelda fan, then.
All right, well, the beautiful part of Orange Lounge Radio is that everybody is entitled to their own opinion, even when they're wrong.
Exactly.
All right, well, Speedy, anything else you want to share with us tonight?
DarkSakura had family obligations tonight, so you get the fuzzy gay man instead.
and Rice Princess.
Whatever, I'll deal.
Alright, yeah, you'll deal.
No, actually, but DarkSakura is going to be in a tape segment next, so you will get some DarkSakura love in this show.
Oh, good.
I'd love to meet some DarkSakura.
Wait, at WC Radio, aren't all your shows, like, dominating Dig right now?
Yeah, we started a few.
You suck.
You're outranking us right now.
Oh, God.
You know what?
Go dig Orange Launch Radio.
They got everybody started with podcasts.
It's all good.
WC Radio's an independent thing, right?
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
I'm all for it.
I'm all for it.
Indie radio all the way.
Awesome.
Well, you're over there, you know, go check out WC Radio stuff.
But really, big Orange Lounge Radio, because give them justice, guys, seriously.
This is a fan saying this, a hardcore OLI fan.
Oh, I should just let this guy talk forever.
He's like inflating my ego.
I'm not even going to be able to get out the door.
Oh, yeah, no, but really, I do love the show, and I don't want to get all mushy on air.
But keep up the good work.
I'll be listening.
No, it's okay.
You can get a little mushy.
It's fine.
All right, no.
We appreciate the call, of course, Speedy.
Have a great day, even if you do hate the Wii, okay?
Okay, I don't hate the Wii.
Alright, I know, I know.
It's like the DS was when it first came out.
There's a lot of games that was like, eh, who gives a shit, you know?
Nintendo got them right.
It was like a fad.
Yeah, I know, but you know, it's a third party.
I'll agree, the third party games on the Wii do kind of suck, but... Just give it time, it'll be good.
EA, I think EA's got their game right now, so... He doesn't like the Wii?
Dude!
Welcome to five minutes ago.
Don't walk out of the room, ever.
Alright.
Anyway, Speedy, we gotta go take other calls, but thanks so much for your call and best of luck with WC Radio.
Okay, thank you very much.
I tell everybody at WC Radio we said hey.
Okay, hey.
Hey.
Alright.
Bye-bye.
Or like on Facebook, you poke them.
We're sending WC Radio a poke right now.
We'll send them a poke.
Goddammit, Eddie, give it to me.
Okay, or don't.
Ew, that sounded terrible.
Okay, not like that.
Ew.
Ew, fish.
Yeah, Facebook is weird because weird random people are adding me now.
I'm like, I don't go to Skolody or anything.
Who the fuck are you?
Well, WC, not WC Radio, maybe they're on Facebook, but Orange Launch Radio is also on Facebook.
I should give that a plug.
Search for OL Army.
We have another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Alex Kidd from a former Sega fame.
How you doing?
Hi, Alex Kidd.
Wow, I'm really sorry to hear about your career.
Whatever happened to you?
Well, I retired in 1990, and rather, I didn't retire.
I got fired by Sega.
They wanted to bring in that stupid fucking rodent, Sonic.
I think you're all familiar with him.
Yeah?
Are you bitter at all about that?
No, because here's what I think.
I think he's only had one good game in the past five years, so I think it's high time that Sega brings me back.
They're bringing back all the classic stuff with Nintendo.
Why don't they bring me back?
Have you written Sega?
Have you talked to your people to talk to Sega's people about making a classic come back?
I've been writing them for years, and I had a restraining order like six years ago, but that's expired now.
What the hell did you do?
Did you send Shinobi World after them?
I mean, what the hell happened?
I don't know, like, Shinobi World was like the last thing I ever did, and then they just threw this hedgehog at me, and I couldn't compete.
Well, DM it, or, I mean, Alex Kidd, you certainly don't know how to play this game, do you?
I'm really bad at this game.
Alex Kidd, you didn't have blast processing.
No, but I mean, look, I could go on the 360 and sell 10 times more copies, which would be 10 copies of the Sonic the Hedgehog game.
Alright, well, Alex Kidd, is there a way we would see you on a virtual console at some point?
I don't know.
I'd like to.
I started writing to Nintendo and I started telling them, you know, bring back those Master System games because nobody played them because your system kicked our system's ass.
What happened there?
Why didn't you go to Nintendo?
If that's where you're feeling the love, Alex, why didn't you go over to Nintendo?
You know, at the time, it was Hiroshi Yamauchi, and he gave me the finger.
Don't you mean he gave you rock, and you had scissors?
Shut up.
I mean, seriously, Alex, that was the worst part of your fucking game.
Who thought of putting rock, paper, scissors in a video game?
Hey, I'm going to spend money on a video game so I can play rock, paper, scissors.
Did you ever fucking play Tecmo Bowl?
It's the same fucking thing.
It's fucking rock, paper, scissors.
Alex, kid, you got a dirty mouth.
I'm going to wash your mouth.
You know what?
Fuck this.
I'm giving it back to my buddy, DMN.
Hold on.
Hey, big jerk.
I have a multiple personality disorder live on the air.
Sorry about that, guys.
Hey, you kind of look like Alex Kidd without glasses.
It's amazing.
What's on your mind, DMN?
Nothing.
Alex Kidd came over and wanted a call.
It was frightening.
Oh, so I can hang up on you then?
No, because I actually have a guest announcement for STFU next week.
Alright, who's on STFU Thursday nights here on OLR?
Your buddy Loki, actually.
Really?
Yeah.
What?
What?
Who said that?
Wait, wait, wait.
Who said that?
Funny Dale.
Okay, hold on a second here.
No kicking Funny Dale because you disagree with him.
Huh?
No kicking Funny Dale because you disagree with him.
Oh, okay.
TheRobD says, I believe Derek H. said he's too straight to listen to OLR.
Whatever.
If you don't know what we're talking about, it's a reference to one of our sister programs, All Games Interactive.
Brother, Sister, Inbred Cousin, whatever you want to say.
I'm too straight to listen to that one line.
DMN, any quick thoughts?
We're going to take one more call before we take a break here.
You should play Luminous Live because it's pretty fun and it's $20.
But I have Luminous... Not Luminous Live, sorry, Luminous Plus.
I have Luminous on Xbox 360.
I don't need it.
Luminous Plus, $20.
That's $20 you ever spend.
You're wrong, but have a nice day anyway.
You're wrong, shut up.
I love hanging up on him.
One more call.
We'll go over here.
Whoa, hello to you too.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Seisho.
Hi, Seisho.
What's on your mind, buddy?
I finally got Final Fantasy XII.
Rice Princess is cheering over here.
Yay, nice British guy.
That's right, Final Fantasy XII finally made its way to the UK shores this week.
And thank you for not spoiling it because it's fucking epic.
It is fucking epic in every sense of the word.
You've probably actually played more of it than I have because my friend stole it.
One of my friends will only play Final Fantasy games.
It's the only games he'll play.
And he took my PlayStation 2 when Final Fantasy XII came out.
I should beat him up for that.
All right.
Well, you've got to take a moment to sell the listeners who feel that Orange Lounge Radio is too gay for their tastes.
Then Final Fantasy XII probably is too.
So sell our listeners on Final Fantasy XII if you would.
um get it because it's like epic and if you play Final Fantasy XI you'll love it because it's just fucking it's Final Fantasy XI but with an actual story I guess RisePrincess made a face because she hates Final Fantasy XI I hate XI but I love XII and there's a bunny lady named Fran and she's hot and she's wearing a thong and you can look at her butt so that's why you should play the game
Mori in our chatroom says, fucking epic is now my new phrase of the week.
Like everybody, that's today's secret word.
Every time you hear the secret word, scream it out loud.
Alright, so that's all you've been playing is Final Fantasy XII non-stop?
Pretty much.
How was the cosplay over there when the game came out?
Did you go to one of those midnight parties with the cosplay and all that stuff?
I went to my local Azdra at midnight and there was like two people queuing up for it and that was it.
I was quite shocked.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Supernova?
Dancing Stage Supernova, because heaven forbid I say revolution in a British territory.
Oh, that's... I don't know.
Well, why else don't they call it Dance Dance Revolution over there?
I don't know.
Anyhow.
They have a completely different song list, right?
Did they call it Dance Dance Revolution on PlayStation 1?
Yeah, I got first mix.
Well, don't you get it in two weeks?
It's really close to coming out, isn't it?
I think so, but I don't know if that's a real release date.
We're getting DDR Universe next week, and I'm pretty excited about that.
Yeah, I'm very excited about DDR Universe.
Dancing Stage Universe should be making its way over there soon enough, I imagine.
All right, well, Stacia, we've got to end our Part A here and get into Part B, but thanks so much for your call.
All right, buddy?
All right.
See you next week.
Take care, my friends.
Bye, sexy face.
You make your flirting so obvious, Rice Princess.
Did you add Rice Princess on MySpace yet?
Yes, I did.
Are you guys corresponding at all?
Maybe.
It's in your business.
Okay.
All right.
I'll back up.
More to come next week's episode.
All right.
Take care, Sesha.
See you.
Bye.
All right.
If you didn't get through right now, don't worry.
The phone lines will be open again in Part B, so please don't get your panties in a bunch that you did not make it onto the show.
because the phone lines will be open again in Part B. We just had a little extra time.
We want to make this part an hour and a half, so there you have it.
Some phone calls.
But we are going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to be back with Part B. DarkSakura is going to be here in pre-taped form.
Also, Beat the Host, one of our favorite OLR games.
We're going to be beating Rob in the ass.
And actually, I'm glad LankyStyle is here because he'd probably be better at it.
He would be good.
How do you feel about classic arcade games?
That's this week's topic.
I feel good.
Yeah, so I think, honestly, if you guys want a challenge tonight, Lanky Styles works out.
I knew that he would.
If you want to make fun of one of the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, Rice Princess would be a good one to pick on, because she'll bomb it.
She'll get one.
She eats rice.
All right, and I will tell you how you can be the listener that battles them very soon, a little bit later on.
But for now, we're going to take a break.
We'll be back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B.
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
