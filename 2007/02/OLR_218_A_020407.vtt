Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
This is episode number 218 for this, February the 4th of 2007.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Yo.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
How you doing, Jamie Summers?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm doing.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Been an interesting week.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Been an interesting week? Yeah, I could say the same.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
It's been a very interesting week. We'll get into that in a minute.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Say hello as well though to Tech Master Loki.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Hello.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm doing good.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Did you have an interesting week as well?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yes.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Alright.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Well, for those of you that are new to our program, we just want to say hello and welcome.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
We were lucky enough to have a story of ours on the front page of DIG this week.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
So we're thinking we might have got a couple new people thanks to that.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a big howdy hello to you.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Thank you for choosing to support independent podcasting, first off.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
And just so you know, we're a show made up of three friends who have kind of become friends to each other just through doing this program.

01:31.000 --> 01:44.000
We sit here and we talk about games every week and the way that you would sit down and talk at a dinner after you've gone to an arcade from a long night of playing DDR or Tekken or Derby Owners Crack, whatever it is that you play at the arcade.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Just kind of sitting around and chatting like old friends.

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
And sometimes we're lucky enough to break news here first because we have some inside contacts thanks to Loki being in the distribution world, among other things.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
But sometimes we're not always going to break the news.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
We're just going to talk about it and give you our viewpoints on it.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
We're dedicated to giving every gamer a voice and we do that partially through our chat room as well.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
A big hello to the chat room.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Joining us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com when we tape live here on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
Also we have our Skype line which we'll open up later in the program. It's also an 800 number you can give us a call at and share your thoughts.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
We'll open that up later.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
So that way all you guys have a voice.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
All right.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
And of course tonight they're talking a little bit in chat room about the Super Bowl which is going on right now.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
But I guess between the three of us we kind of don't really keep tabs on what's going on in the Super Bowl.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
But I will say the Puppy Bowl was awesome and I'm kind of sad I missed the kitty half time.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
But the Puppy Bowl is kind of boring.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
But the Puppy Bowl is cute because they have the bowl.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I like the bowl cam.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
You know what? They need like a Madden for puppies.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Would you buy Puppy Bowl the game?

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
There was a Japanese TV show that I used to have a few copies of on tape.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
It was called Uri Nari Land and they had dog soccer and baby soccer and cow soccer.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
The closest I've come is Mega Man soccer I'm sorry to say.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I was thinking the Puppy Bowl would be something like that and it wasn't.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
It was cute but it was just three hours of cuteness.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Puppies playing.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I was sitting in here working on some last minute things for the show

03:17.000 --> 03:29.000
and I just hear out in the living room dark soccer and my roommate going.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
That was your roommate that was not me.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
No it was you.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Puppies.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
It was both of you.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
All right, well let's get into the game stuff.

03:36.000 --> 03:48.360
I was on my ass in this chair, playing Tech in Dark Resurrection on PSP, and I'm gonna

03:48.360 --> 03:52.040
get Dancing Blade, because I played the old one, and that was pretty cool.

03:52.040 --> 03:56.240
I actually did not play any Cooking Mama this week.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.520
Are you in a 12-step recovery program?

03:58.520 --> 04:04.360
No, I'm in a, oh my god, my midterms are next week type of thing, so I've been studying

04:04.360 --> 04:05.360
muscle groups.

04:05.360 --> 04:12.120
Well, I guess if I went back and played some Trauma Center, I'd be okay for class or something.

04:12.120 --> 04:16.600
I loaned out my copy of Trauma Center to a friend of mine who just got a Wii, so I'm

04:16.600 --> 04:21.720
sorry to say I don't have my version for you to practice on, but that's a fun game.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.720
So fun.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.880
I like the Trauma Center.

04:25.880 --> 04:31.400
I've actually gotten pretty good at some of it, but it's still frustrating.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.520
Can't I just rub them until they're better?

04:34.520 --> 04:36.400
So yeah.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
That's really doing it though.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
Alright.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.400
Loki, how was your gaming week?

04:39.400 --> 04:45.320
I played more of the Crackdown demo, like, another three or four times yesterday.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.320
I love that game.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.320
I just can't wait for the full thing to come out.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.920
You know, it's one of those games that I was like, well, you know, because everyone was

04:51.920 --> 04:56.240
saying, oh, it's kind of the demo, they didn't like the demo or anything like that originally

04:56.240 --> 04:57.240
when I was first hearing about it.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.160
I was kind of like, well, you know, I don't know if I'm gonna like this.

05:00.160 --> 05:05.400
I actually like it better because you can actually explore a lot more of the city.

05:05.400 --> 05:11.840
I did climb to the top of the tower in the middle of the city, which is fun, difficult,

05:11.840 --> 05:18.440
and a little bit, you know, a little bit frustrating at times because, you know, if you fall off

05:18.440 --> 05:24.120
that thing, you're pretty dead because you're falling like 50 stories, but it's cool because

05:24.120 --> 05:28.640
once I climbed to the top and I had like 10 seconds left, I jumped to my death trying

05:28.640 --> 05:33.100
to land on another cop because that was funny, but yeah, it was great.

05:33.100 --> 05:37.760
And then I tried out another demo, actually NBA Street Home Court, a little bit different

05:37.760 --> 05:40.400
of a type of game that I'd normally play, but it's pretty cool.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.960
It actually looks really good.

05:41.960 --> 05:45.920
All the screenshots are definitely pretty accurate of how the game is.

05:45.920 --> 05:51.720
It's pretty cool, kind of reminds me of NBA Jam a little bit because, you know, the players

05:51.720 --> 05:57.080
are doing stuff that you would normally not see anyone doing in basketball, but it's pretty

05:57.080 --> 05:58.080
fun.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.760
It's not a game I'd be picking up, but, you know, definitely a fun game.

06:00.760 --> 06:05.360
I really wish NBA Jam would just come back, you know, because NFL Blitz is kind of lame.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.760
You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but NBA Jam was definitely one I could get

06:08.760 --> 06:09.760
into.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.760
That game was a lot of fun.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.760
It really was.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.160
I just love the old NFL Blitz, but this Blitz League shit's retarded.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.800
Some comments from chat room regarding your comments on Crackdown.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.760
Jeremy Todd 1 says, the grenade launcher in the Crackdown demo is so freaking awesome,

06:21.760 --> 06:25.720
you can literally just keep blowing everyone up with a single button push.

06:25.720 --> 06:29.520
Flying flaming people equals automatic 10 out of 10 score.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.600
Mr. Gohan wants to know, how did you get up there?

06:31.600 --> 06:33.680
Jeremy How'd I get up there?

06:33.680 --> 06:34.680
Climbing.

06:34.680 --> 06:39.400
Seriously, it's just climbing, you know.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.400
If you keep climbing up the side of the building, you'll eventually get to this part where it's

06:42.400 --> 06:47.680
kind of flat, then on one of the ends of the three towers, they have, like, scaffolding.

06:47.680 --> 06:52.200
If you jump on the scaffolding, you can kind of make your way up a little bit more, but

06:52.200 --> 06:58.480
you really need to have, like, you know, at least a third level on your, you know, jumping

06:58.480 --> 07:04.920
and stuff in order to be able to reach some of that, but you can get pretty high.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.780
It's pretty fun, and it's even more amazing, too, when you get that high, you can still

07:08.780 --> 07:10.760
see all the cars and people walking down below.

07:10.760 --> 07:15.000
I mean, that's pretty amazing, you know, compared to, like, Saints Row, which, you know, you

07:15.000 --> 07:19.960
wouldn't see any of that stuff, stuff would be glitching out and stuff, but I can't wait.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.680
I can't wait for Saints Row 2 whenever the hell that comes out.

07:22.680 --> 07:23.680
Crackdown!

07:23.680 --> 07:26.800
That's going to hold me over for a long time.

07:26.800 --> 07:27.800
Hold you over until what?

07:27.800 --> 07:28.800
Oh, Grand Theft Auto?

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
Is that what you're waiting for?

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
Oh, yeah, Grand Theft Auto IV.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.800
Anything else?

07:31.800 --> 07:37.120
No, actually, oh, I played Luminous a little bit, I beat some, I got some more achievements

07:37.120 --> 07:44.320
playing the time attack stuff, and I think that's all I played, yeah, that's it.

07:44.320 --> 07:49.440
Alright, well, my gaming week wasn't too thrilling because I'm still in my World of War Crack

07:49.440 --> 07:53.280
mode, so I'm still playing there with the guild, which, by the way, if you're interested

07:53.280 --> 07:57.860
in joining our guild, we have a few OLR listeners in there that I've been playing with and chatting

07:57.860 --> 07:58.860
with, it's fun.

07:58.860 --> 08:02.400
I was just on there about an hour before we went live tonight, and if you want to join,

08:02.400 --> 08:06.860
there's more information on our forums, it's orangeonsready.com, click on forums, right

08:06.860 --> 08:12.260
now we play on the Ravencrest server on the Horde side, for the Horde, anyway, it's fun.

08:12.260 --> 08:15.200
So a lot of people are making their Blood Elves over there because it's a newer server.

08:15.200 --> 08:21.680
But anyway, outside of War Crack, not a whole lot of other games per se, but I did finally

08:21.680 --> 08:26.640
check out Xbox 360's movie marketplace, because when it first launched, there was really nothing

08:26.640 --> 08:30.440
I wanted to see, but then they added a bunch of Lionsgate movies just like a week and a

08:30.440 --> 08:34.660
half ago, it's kind of like the artsy, well, sometimes, sometimes they have big budget

08:34.660 --> 08:38.480
films like Saw, and I guess The Descent was kind of up there, but usually it's like kind

08:38.480 --> 08:39.620
of artsy films.

08:39.620 --> 08:43.200
So there was a film on there that one of my friends had seen that said I'd probably like

08:43.200 --> 08:47.240
called Hard Candy, which I decided to download in HD, just because I wanted to see how was

08:47.240 --> 08:53.080
the HD delivery and everything, and well, the movie itself was kind of weird, I mean,

08:53.080 --> 08:56.600
I guess it was good for like the first 40 minutes, then it was just like WTF, it was

08:56.600 --> 09:01.320
kind of gross, but anyway, outside the movie, I mean, I realized that Microsoft can't do

09:01.320 --> 09:05.400
anything about that, the quality wasn't too bad, I thought it was kind of weird, because

09:05.400 --> 09:10.760
when you first start watching the movie, it actually continues to download the last portion

09:10.760 --> 09:14.920
of the movie, so you can't really rewind or fast forward or any of that stuff for the

09:14.920 --> 09:19.360
first little bit of the movie until I was about an hour in, then it finally finished

09:19.360 --> 09:23.120
downloading the rest of the movie, so I could rewind, fast forward, whatever, and basically,

09:23.120 --> 09:28.120
once you download the movie to your hard drive, you have 14 days to start watching it, and

09:28.120 --> 09:32.720
then, once you press the play button and start watching it, you have 24 hours to finish it,

09:32.720 --> 09:35.620
which you know, if I'm going to sit down and watch a movie, that was certainly ample time

09:35.620 --> 09:39.860
for me to finish it, but just so you know before you download any of that stuff, picture

09:39.860 --> 09:45.580
quality because I downloaded an HD was pretty good I don't know if HD gives me

09:45.580 --> 09:49.980
anything that much more than DVD does I mean yeah it's a little crisper yeah the

09:49.980 --> 09:55.940
colors stick out a little more but is it worth essentially six dollars that I'm

09:55.940 --> 10:01.660
paying to download the HD movie to watch one time I don't know I don't know I

10:01.660 --> 10:05.840
might be better off just getting the HD DVD player and getting a Netflix I don't

10:05.840 --> 10:09.640
know yet so it's hard to tell too because hard candy wasn't exactly a movie

10:09.640 --> 10:13.500
with lots of bang up special effects and things it would be easier maybe if I

10:13.500 --> 10:16.480
downloaded something like Poseidon that might have more of that I don't know but

10:16.480 --> 10:22.820
it wasn't bad I would use the service again because at least it wasn't having

10:22.820 --> 10:26.820
the slowdown problems that the store did when it first launched whatever I guess

10:26.820 --> 10:30.180
maybe the curiosity factor is settled down a lot and things it's easier to get

10:30.180 --> 10:34.420
in there and download movies now so I I would recommend if there's a movie on

10:34.420 --> 10:37.780
there that interests you you want to see how it looks download one try it for

10:37.780 --> 10:41.860
yourself why not I also downloaded for free because it was for free for a

10:41.860 --> 10:44.820
couple days the first episode of the Sarah Silverman program which is

10:44.820 --> 10:49.260
hilarious but the audio is off a little bit as it because we also take my

10:49.260 --> 10:52.460
roommate taped it on the DVR and then I was like oh we can download it'll be

10:52.460 --> 10:56.500
like perfect quality and while the video quality was great the sound was off I

10:56.500 --> 10:59.220
don't know if that was me or what the hell was going I don't mean the sound

10:59.220 --> 11:03.100
was muted but the sound was like you know when the sound is like just a hair

11:03.100 --> 11:06.820
off of the lips it just bugs the hell out of you because it looks like you're

11:06.820 --> 11:12.940
watching an old karate movie or something yeah yeah it's bad so maybe

11:12.940 --> 11:19.020
it's just my copy of it I don't know whatever going to the chat room and

11:19.020 --> 11:23.300
seeing what the folks are saying there in the chat room let's see black boy

11:23.300 --> 11:27.900
says God Shelley winters in HD no not that not the old ass Poseidon adventure

11:27.900 --> 11:32.660
I mean the new one who then what the new one have in it it had was that guy it's

11:32.660 --> 11:38.460
in them got it can you remember his name who's the guy that's a snake in revenge

11:38.460 --> 11:43.180
of New York or whatever oh that's carousel carousals in it that's what it

11:43.180 --> 11:47.660
is Mike W says that Rob is a movie snob yeah maybe a little bit I don't know

11:47.660 --> 11:52.860
Mike W says Rob like only plays Xbox Live Arcade yeah lately that's what I've

11:52.860 --> 11:56.060
been playing there hasn't been a whole lot released on discs that I've wanted

11:56.060 --> 12:00.940
to play but I enjoyed heavy weapon I love luminous I love the Xbox Live

12:00.940 --> 12:04.860
Arcade it's like those little little throwaway games with a little like

12:04.860 --> 12:08.940
because I have gamer a DD if you've lived in the show long enough you know

12:08.940 --> 12:13.140
that I never stick with one game for a long time with the exception of the few

12:13.140 --> 12:16.900
MMOs I've played and even then I quit and go back and quit and go back all the

12:16.900 --> 12:21.220
time so Xbox Live Arcade games are perfect for me but I do want to check

12:21.220 --> 12:25.300
out fusion frenzy which is kind of the same thing it's like 40 minigames in one

12:25.300 --> 12:29.140

12:29.140 --> 12:31.980

14:03.580 --> 14:07.420
right well let's get into some gaming news and we're gonna start it off as I

14:07.420 --> 14:10.900
mentioned at the top of the show we were very lucky to have our coverage of dance

14:10.900 --> 14:15.060
dance revolution hottest party hit dig this week so thank you guys very much

14:15.060 --> 14:19.580
for giving us a dig on there and as we reported we were lucky enough to attend

14:19.580 --> 14:23.060
Konami gamers day earlier this week and we'll tell you more about it throughout

14:23.060 --> 14:26.900
the rest of the show here but of course you know since our show started many

14:26.900 --> 14:32.300
years ago as a Bamani DDR music game type station we know a lot of our

14:32.300 --> 14:35.080
longtime fans are very interested in this title and heck even some of you

14:35.080 --> 14:38.300
guys who've come to listen to Orange Lounge Radio when we just tapped into

14:38.300 --> 14:42.160
gaming in general you still can understand the dance dance revolution is

14:42.160 --> 14:46.240
really up there it's the top if not one of the top maybe next to guitar here I

14:46.240 --> 14:50.340
don't know music game franchises that people really follow so I think a lot of

14:50.340 --> 14:53.460
people expected the DDR was going to come to the Wii it was just a matter of

14:53.460 --> 14:57.220
time I don't know about you I wasn't expecting to hear it this early like I

14:57.220 --> 15:01.100
kind of thought we would see it maybe like doesn't seem still early in the

15:01.100 --> 15:05.620
Wii's life for us to be getting this game I don't know maybe maybe so I was

15:05.620 --> 15:08.100
surprised at the timing of it I thought we wouldn't hear anything about it till

15:08.100 --> 15:11.140
at least e3 if not 2008 but it looks like we are getting it this year at

15:11.140 --> 15:13.860
least a cool point because it's not gonna be another PlayStation 2 version

15:13.860 --> 15:17.860
this year I would think I don't know they didn't show one off so that would

15:17.860 --> 15:21.580
that would imply that but I don't know there's a lot of stuff they didn't show

15:21.580 --> 15:25.420
off economy gamers day so they didn't say anything about Metal Gear Solid 4

15:25.420 --> 15:28.180
except kind of cock tease us with a release date and then not say anything

15:28.180 --> 15:33.740
that was stupid they knew they knew me soon I was like that's such a they knew

15:33.740 --> 15:37.740
we all wanted to know it they didn't say anything about Silent Hill origins I'm

15:37.740 --> 15:41.100
wondering if that game got cancelled cuz coding on it's still it's still like

15:41.100 --> 15:45.820
it's pushed back that's for sure Silent Hill now Silent Hill 5 was the game I

15:45.820 --> 15:49.380
was thinking we were gonna see I cuz you know though we're gonna get a Silent

15:49.380 --> 15:52.140
Hill 5 at some point the first four games are phenomenal there's the movie

15:52.140 --> 15:54.860
and everything duh we have to get a Silent Hill 5 at some what nothing I

15:54.860 --> 15:58.060
think economy gamers dating up about Silent Hill 5 doesn't that make you sad

15:58.060 --> 16:03.180
dark soccer because I was looking forward to Silent Hill 5 not really why

16:03.180 --> 16:07.620
because that sort might leave it to a much bigger announcement coming up later

16:07.620 --> 16:12.380
ah so you think Silent Hill 5 is worthy of a press conference all on its own why

16:12.380 --> 16:16.100
not okay fair enough maybe when they announce the sequel to the movie I don't

16:16.100 --> 16:20.980
know well anyway a three new songs in DDR hottest party lips of an angel gonna

16:20.980 --> 16:24.420
make you sweat and will buy a Naoki what's interesting with that is that the

16:24.420 --> 16:28.220
teaser trailer teased that it was a brand new soundtrack from the ground up

16:28.220 --> 16:31.060
and so it's kind of interesting because you have this lips of names are gonna

16:31.060 --> 16:34.220
be sweat and then there was a weird cover of breakdown in there yes I

16:34.220 --> 16:40.740
remember both of myself and Mel B we right when the trailer annual that was a

16:40.740 --> 16:45.700
really weird version of that song it's like what the fuck was that and they

16:45.700 --> 16:49.820
talk about a soundtrack spanning four decades worth of music so I'm wondering

16:49.820 --> 16:53.220
if this isn't kind of like the direction we're gonna see for the soundtrack an

16:53.220 --> 16:58.260
all-new soundtrack of like remade songs of the last four decades along with a

16:58.260 --> 17:00.620
few economy originals like this will bow Naoki

17:00.620 --> 17:06.380
uh-huh we'll see it was interesting a little demo now of course it's on the

17:06.380 --> 17:09.920
ween you gotta wonder how's the Wii remote gonna be used and yes you use the

17:09.920 --> 17:13.220
Wii remote in the game they add a little basically I think this is more of a

17:13.220 --> 17:16.740
concept build what we were looking at at this at the show because it basically

17:16.740 --> 17:21.060
looked like DDR supernova but blue and then like every so often an arrow would

17:21.060 --> 17:24.620
be replaced with this little icon that kind of looked like the Wiimote and then

17:24.620 --> 17:28.760
uncheck the other cause symbol kinda it looked kind of weird and you that was

17:28.760 --> 17:32.020
just your indication of shake you could do anything you want but they were very

17:32.020 --> 17:35.360
I mean Jason Enos who's like the producer for this that was there demo in

17:35.360 --> 17:38.540
the game and he said this is he emphasized over and over again this is a

17:38.540 --> 17:42.380
very early concept thing we just want people to know it's coming we're still

17:42.380 --> 17:48.220
really experimenting with what the we thing is going to do by the way I want

17:48.220 --> 17:50.740
to mention something I didn't post anywhere on the site since Jason Enos

17:50.740 --> 17:54.100
was there I took an opportunity to ask him a couple questions and I asked him I

17:54.100 --> 17:58.020
said so how about DDR in the arcade and anything you want to say about DDR in

17:58.020 --> 18:00.740
the arcade and he of course didn't really have anything to say I said what

18:00.740 --> 18:03.980
about that rumor there's an expansion coming to supernova with you know the

18:03.980 --> 18:08.100
20 30 20 30 or more songs he said he didn't know anything about it which

18:08.100 --> 18:11.700
could be the polite way of saying no comment I don't know but rest assured

18:11.700 --> 18:16.580
those rumors that you've seen floating around the other DDR sites Jason says

18:16.580 --> 18:20.140
you don't know about it so that's what I'm going with I'll trust him that's

18:20.140 --> 18:25.100
interesting that is I was reading there's some rumored release dates and I

18:25.100 --> 18:30.420
haven't heard anything about this yet but that was it that stupid Codemasters

18:30.420 --> 18:36.300
dance factory game was gonna be coming to the Wii in March before DDR oh

18:36.300 --> 18:41.340
interesting but I mean I can tell you right now the games could be ass just

18:41.340 --> 18:45.180
because the last one is ass I'm looking at some comments from chat room Jeremy

18:45.180 --> 18:48.340
Todd once says Silent Hill origins is now the next Duke Nukem forever god I

18:48.340 --> 18:53.140
hope not jaded says Silent Hill there won't be a five I doubt that those those

18:53.140 --> 18:56.620
are big where there's got four sold pretty well didn't it I'll see why there

18:56.620 --> 19:01.820
wouldn't be a five all right Rama says DDR supernova 2 in the groove dream on

19:01.820 --> 19:07.060
dream I'm sorry I've been following the Bahmani scene for a long time in the

19:07.060 --> 19:11.500
groove songs are not is not coming to DDR and I I don't I don't have any

19:11.500 --> 19:14.860
insider knowledge to back that up granted but just having followed Konami

19:14.860 --> 19:18.740
in the biases as long as I have it's not happening stop getting your hopes up

19:18.740 --> 19:21.860
about it because you're gonna be disappointed I'm sorry not happening

19:21.860 --> 19:26.700
once that ruling passed in the groove was officially dead so anyway that away

19:26.700 --> 19:31.100
from that back to DDR on the week that's what we really want to talk about yeah

19:31.100 --> 19:33.500
what I thought was interesting is the selection screen you could use the Wii

19:33.500 --> 19:36.860
remote to like point-and-click at songs you wanted to play and it had a cute

19:36.860 --> 19:40.860
little DDR arrow icon I don't know just it's a long memory right now yeah I'm

19:40.860 --> 19:44.060
sure I'm sure what did you think look because you actually got to play it what

19:44.060 --> 19:50.100
did you think actually playing the game did it feel right was it weird it was

19:50.100 --> 19:55.940
like DDR hands and feet mode but it's just it's it let me put it this way the

19:55.940 --> 20:00.020
hands and feet mode was awkward this is just as equally as awkward at least as

20:00.020 --> 20:04.780
it is right now and it's not it's just it doesn't it's almost like it doesn't

20:04.780 --> 20:08.980
need to be there just because you know you supported the iToy you don't need to

20:08.980 --> 20:13.300
have a hands and feet mode in that although the thing is though if they do

20:13.300 --> 20:17.180
something like this they could do some really interesting stuff with it like

20:17.180 --> 20:20.220
instead of you know have a whole section of the song that's all done with your

20:20.220 --> 20:23.300
hands I mean that might be kind of cool that's what Jason was kind of implying

20:23.300 --> 20:26.620
that they might want to do things where you do different motions like he

20:26.620 --> 20:30.340
referenced Saturday Night Fever like the disco pose like there might be a symbol

20:30.340 --> 20:33.820
that you have to do that kind of pose and that they could do like what was in

20:33.820 --> 20:37.240
a samba de amigo that and that's what a lot of people are coming away from the

20:37.240 --> 20:40.540
saying is that it sounds like it could be DDR mixed with samba de amigo and I

20:40.540 --> 20:44.220
don't see any reason why that's not a possibility so I mean it right now it's

20:44.220 --> 20:48.780
just it's still way too early it is and you know that there's DDR with possible

20:48.780 --> 20:53.140
stuff I was able when I played it I thought it was it did feel like it

20:53.140 --> 20:56.220
played a lot like hands and feet mode because none of this extra stuff was in

20:56.220 --> 20:59.420
there but I felt it was a lot cleaner because the problem I have with the

20:59.420 --> 21:04.660
itoy is the device just sucks yeah if you're not in the exact right lighting

21:04.660 --> 21:09.300
it doesn't win that's not Konami's fault it's just the itoy sucks I'm sorry I've

21:09.300 --> 21:15.100
not played one good thing with the itoy not one and you have to have the exact

21:15.100 --> 21:18.660
right lighting to make it work and it never is right on DDR I don't know if

21:18.660 --> 21:21.540
you have a house where you can get it to work every time but the nice thing about

21:21.540 --> 21:26.100
playing this on the Wii was that it worked every time like it you you know

21:26.100 --> 21:30.500
it you don't have to have the perfect white background in your house to get

21:30.500 --> 21:34.140
the wiimote shaking to pick up so that's what I liked about it is that and it

21:34.140 --> 21:37.380
didn't matter where my hands or feet where I could kind of do it wherever so

21:37.380 --> 21:41.700
that was kind of fun so I I had fun with it and it certainly posed to I mean I

21:41.700 --> 21:45.860
was struggling on medium level difficulty songs you know so it

21:45.860 --> 21:48.780
certainly adds a whole new challenge to it which I'm sure the purists will not be

21:48.780 --> 21:53.220
happy about but DDR needs to evolve I did find it interesting though that all

21:53.220 --> 21:58.260
the dance pads were just the GameCube dance pads I think you know in speculating

21:58.260 --> 22:00.700
that DDR was going to come out on the Wii I wondered how they were gonna do

22:00.700 --> 22:04.340
the wireless pad without lag and it never occurred to me duh just use the

22:04.340 --> 22:07.660
GameCube pads because there's GameCube controllers on the thing and looks like

22:07.660 --> 22:10.100
that's what they're doing because that's what in the trailer you could see

22:10.100 --> 22:13.900
clearly that even the non Mario pads they use in the trailer were just plug

22:13.900 --> 22:18.060
in yeah the GameCube slots anyway just really quite wanted to quickly say about

22:18.060 --> 22:23.020
DDR Wii before we move on also it's going to feature an updated battle mode

22:23.020 --> 22:27.100
a support mode where I know they talked about they really want this to be the

22:27.100 --> 22:31.220
family DDR they want this to be the game that mom dad kid brother sister all play

22:31.220 --> 22:34.660
together and they they're gonna have a mode in this where you actually talk to

22:34.660 --> 22:38.140
each other and you have to do the same pose at a certain part in the song they

22:38.140 --> 22:41.220
know they want that in one type of mode so you have to communicate with each

22:41.220 --> 22:44.180
other say okay we're gonna disco we're gonna disco whoa we're gonna sprinkler

22:44.180 --> 22:47.900
Roger Rabbit I don't know whatever so that's gonna be interesting I think if

22:47.900 --> 22:52.580
nothing else now also free play mode and work workout mode no sign of edit mode

22:52.580 --> 22:55.660
but I don't see how you couldn't have a DDR right now without edit mode so I

22:55.660 --> 22:57.800
don't see why that wouldn't be coming for those that want to edit the Wii

22:57.800 --> 23:01.180
things into it yeah it's way early it's probably just a technical issue for

23:01.180 --> 23:04.860
right now so if you want to see more on it we even have some pictures we took

23:04.860 --> 23:08.820
some pictures of the trailer which hasn't come out anywhere else yet and

23:08.820 --> 23:11.540
there's a picture behind the scenes there you can see Jason a demoing it

23:11.540 --> 23:15.700
for some girl from some unknown press site who's giggling over it you see all

23:15.700 --> 23:20.820
that on our site and we have the only picture of the interface as it is now

23:20.820 --> 23:23.380
but that's going to change the interface is going to change that was obviously a

23:23.380 --> 23:26.820
temporary interface but that's all at orange lounge radio.com if you want to

23:26.820 --> 23:30.700
see more information on that so Loki what what else did you see economies

23:30.700 --> 23:33.620
gamers say that you enjoyed there's actually quite a few games there and I

23:33.620 --> 23:37.260
got to try a little bit of everything one of the first games I tried was time

23:37.260 --> 23:41.380
ace which in the preview kind of reminded me of time pilot because you're

23:41.380 --> 23:44.540
playing in kind of different time periods and you're flying planes and

23:44.540 --> 23:49.700
stuff the game itself actually reminded me the graphics remind me of prop cycle

23:49.700 --> 23:53.020
I don't know if you remember that old arcade game I freaking love prop cycle

23:53.020 --> 23:56.540
that's like one of the most underrated arcade games ever it reminded me very

23:56.540 --> 24:01.220
much of that it weren't you big on prop cycle Jamie I remember you looked at an

24:01.220 --> 24:05.020
M car K when it came out yeah the prop cycle is a bomb and you fan yourself I

24:05.020 --> 24:09.780
played it for free I love so much anyway sorry anyways but on the game kind of

24:09.780 --> 24:13.380
reminds me of at least the level that they had you try out where you kind of

24:13.380 --> 24:18.380
playing this biplane thing to be honest the game itself could very much be wing

24:18.380 --> 24:22.020
island on the DS I mean you're just you know doing different missions you're

24:22.020 --> 24:26.300
fighting you know planes in the air I mean it seemed pretty solid you know

24:26.300 --> 24:29.540
graphics are a bit rough but I guess that's you know that's just a DS for you

24:29.540 --> 24:32.220
what is it you were saying something about you thought this was a sequel to

24:32.220 --> 24:35.620
time pilot I thought it was a sequel to time pilot that's I mean it makes it

24:35.620 --> 24:40.140
time ace time pilot meaning both of them are biplane games where you're fighting

24:40.140 --> 24:44.500
in different you know time periods it seems logical to me and interesting I

24:44.500 --> 24:48.940
just know I for some stupid reason to not make that connection I don't know I

24:48.940 --> 24:52.900
just thought that's you know what they were doing I could be wrong they could

24:52.900 --> 24:56.900
just be kind of a something that's almost identical and has almost the same

24:56.900 --> 25:02.520
name whatever another game I did play though was coded arms contagion for the

25:02.520 --> 25:09.580
PSP and I can tell you having played the first one it still sucks and you know

25:09.580 --> 25:12.940
it's very unfortunate because it looks like they really tried to make the game

25:12.940 --> 25:17.980
load better it's just unfortunately for the PSP first-person shooters just suck

25:17.980 --> 25:22.060
on the PSP and that's just because they don't have two analog sticks it's really

25:22.060 --> 25:26.860
hard it's real sluggish to move around if maybe if they increase how fast you

25:26.860 --> 25:30.740
turn and stuff in it might be a little bit better but it's just those four face

25:30.740 --> 25:36.260
buttons using as like a second analog stick it's just not good at all that's

25:36.260 --> 25:39.940
really unfortunately a problem with the system but you know the game itself

25:39.940 --> 25:44.740
looks pretty good I mean it's okay I just I didn't have very much fun with it

25:44.740 --> 25:48.620
but you know what can you what can you say yes if you're used to playing you

25:48.620 --> 25:51.820
know first-person shooters on the PSP then great maybe one to check out

25:51.820 --> 25:56.060
definitely a good thing that they didn't do the random levels like they did the

25:56.060 --> 26:03.260
first one but it kind of reminds me like a Metroid Prime type game Dewey's

26:03.260 --> 26:08.020
adventure I know we saw the video of that looked okay kind of reminded me of

26:08.020 --> 26:12.140
Kirby a little bit actually reminded me of one of their own titles it reminded

26:12.140 --> 26:18.340
me of the Koron Koron I can't say that Korin pa Korin pa I can't say that word

26:18.340 --> 26:22.340
it reminded me of Korin pa kind of like in the way that you tilted the

26:22.340 --> 26:25.860
environment around but yet with this additional angle of changing the

26:25.860 --> 26:29.580
temperatures to change Dewey from a liquid to a solid and from a solid to a

26:29.580 --> 26:33.420
gas and what were they saying something about like when he's in solid form he

26:33.420 --> 26:36.580
damages enemies more but he's more difficult to control when he's in liquid

26:36.580 --> 26:39.900
form he can't really damage enemies but he's easier to control and then when

26:39.900 --> 26:43.780
he's in gas form he just kind of goes wherever he just but he can't really do

26:43.780 --> 26:46.960
anything else it's very interesting the way you change temperature and it's

26:46.960 --> 26:50.020
supposed to change the environments completely so it's a nice thing you can

26:50.020 --> 26:54.740
actually shake the controller certain ways to you know cause earthquakes or to

26:54.740 --> 26:58.380
like cause wind and stuff like that so that's kind of unique for a platform

26:58.380 --> 26:59.380
game.

26:59.380 --> 27:02.980
When they were about to announce Dewey�s Adventure and they were showing the trailer

27:02.980 --> 27:05.740
and everything and they didn�t tell us what the name of it was yet, didn�t you think

27:05.740 --> 27:08.020
we were about to see Elibits 2?

27:08.020 --> 27:09.180
I totally thought that�s what was coming.

27:09.180 --> 27:13.500
The cut scene for the artwork is exactly the same.

27:13.500 --> 27:17.280
It�s the same style, they got the same people that did all the arts in Elibits to do this

27:17.280 --> 27:18.280
game.

27:18.280 --> 27:24.340
It even had glowing creatures that were small.

27:24.340 --> 27:27.300
All they�re doing is remaking Elibits all over again.

27:27.300 --> 27:30.420
But then when we actually heard about the concept, it was nothing like Elibits at all.

27:30.420 --> 27:31.420
No, it�s not.

27:31.420 --> 27:35.900
But I kind of thought it would be interesting to keep it in the same universe but just have

27:35.900 --> 27:40.980
it be a different thing, because it�s almost like the same art style.

27:40.980 --> 27:46.660
I could see it later on, they�re having a box set from this guy, it�s like a bunch

27:46.660 --> 27:50.140
of different stories that are kind of in the same universe because they all seem to be

27:50.140 --> 27:54.100
told the same way with really bad dialogue over the entire cut scene.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.100
It was cute.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.100
It was cute.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.100
But yeah, it was okay.

27:57.100 --> 28:01.820
There are tsunami props for original stuff with that in Elibits and everything.

28:01.820 --> 28:06.180
How easy would it have been to have just ported Castlevania to the Wii where you use the Wii

28:06.180 --> 28:07.180
as the whip?

28:07.180 --> 28:08.180
Whoopee-doo!

28:08.180 --> 28:11.060
But they�re coming up instead with original things for the Wii, which I think is kind

28:11.060 --> 28:12.060
of cute.

28:12.060 --> 28:13.220
But I want a Castlevania game where you use the Wii as the whip.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.800
I know we all want that.

28:14.800 --> 28:15.800
We don�t need it right now.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.420
We have this other Castlevania thing to look forward to we�re going to talk about in

28:18.420 --> 28:19.420
a minute.

28:19.420 --> 28:20.420
We don�t need another 3D Castlevania though.

28:20.420 --> 28:21.420
That�s true.

28:21.420 --> 28:22.420
Castlevania 64 still burns a little bit.

28:22.420 --> 28:26.480
Hey now, we have 3D Castlevanias that aren�t that bad.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.480
But they�re not that good either.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.540
Castlevania 64 made my soul cry.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.260
Compared to Symphony of the Night, everything since looks like poop.

28:33.260 --> 28:34.260
I�m sorry.

28:34.260 --> 28:35.260
No, no, no.

28:35.260 --> 28:37.740
Compared to freaking Rondo of Blood, everything is poop.

28:37.740 --> 28:38.740
We�ll get there in a minute, sweetie.

28:38.740 --> 28:39.740
We�ll get there in a minute.

28:39.740 --> 28:40.740
I know.

28:40.740 --> 28:45.260
Well, Symphony of the Night was great, but it wasn�t a true Castlevania in my opinion.

28:45.260 --> 28:46.260
It was like Metroid featuring�

28:46.260 --> 28:47.260
Then fart in words.

28:47.260 --> 28:48.260
Then fart in words.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.260
Then fart in words.

28:49.260 --> 28:52.260
It was Metroid featuring the Castlevania characters.

28:52.260 --> 28:54.660
I�m not saying it was a bad game.

28:54.660 --> 28:59.820
It�s one of my favorites ever, but it was Metroid featuring Castlevania characters.

28:59.820 --> 29:03.140
But it was the best thing I�ve ever played, one of the best games I�ve ever played in

29:03.140 --> 29:04.140
my life.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.900
And granted, I think the best video game ever made.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.860
I don�t know how many times I�ve said this on the show, but I think the greatest

29:09.860 --> 29:12.620
video game of all time is Super Metroid.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.620
Dude, Metroidvania.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.260
And so of course I love Symphony of the Night.

29:15.260 --> 29:17.060
Junami said it best, though.

29:17.060 --> 29:18.060
Metroidvania.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.060
Whatever.

29:19.060 --> 29:20.060
Anyway.

29:20.060 --> 29:23.740
Anyway, so another game that wasn�t like Metroid, Hellboy, was actually pretty cool.

29:23.740 --> 29:27.500
It�s kind of a beat-em-up type of game, of course, based on the Hellboy comic.

29:27.500 --> 29:32.660
It looks really good from what I�ve seen so far, and they had one level that they were

29:32.660 --> 29:34.940
demoing there at the moment.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.700
And it was kind of cool.

29:36.700 --> 29:40.580
Definitely a lot of detail in there, and it�s kind of cool you can go around ripping heads

29:40.580 --> 29:45.420
off of little demons and throw them at them and stuff like that, and the entire environment

29:45.420 --> 29:46.820
was pretty destructible.

29:46.820 --> 29:52.240
So I think it definitely looks like a better game, definitely a lot better than their last

29:52.240 --> 29:56.700
brawler that came out, so it should be good.

29:56.700 --> 29:58.340
The other one, Wing Island.

29:58.340 --> 30:06.380
Wing Island on the Wii actually could very well be a sister game to Pilotwings.

30:06.380 --> 30:11.660
It pretty much is Pilotwings from what I�ve seen, and also once again kind of the same

30:11.660 --> 30:16.200
art style as Prop Cycle.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.540
Very simple graphics, but it�s fun.

30:18.540 --> 30:22.820
You play a squadron of biplanes and you get a bunch of different missions from finding

30:22.820 --> 30:29.460
lost cows to delivering goods to putting out fires and stuff like that.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.420
So definitely kind of the same feel as a Pilotwings game.

30:32.420 --> 30:36.340
I�m looking at chat trying to answer some questions.

30:36.340 --> 30:42.060
Travis Donovan for Prez in �08 asks, �How did Rob get an Elibit for his 360 Gamer picture?�

30:42.060 --> 30:46.060
You�re seeing a lot of people on Xbox do this now, and it�s all thanks to the Xbox

30:46.060 --> 30:50.260
Webcam, and the way I got an Elibit is that I got one of the little stuffed Elibits from

30:50.260 --> 30:54.240
GameStop even though I didn�t pre-order the game, but I got that and I just put it

30:54.240 --> 30:57.300
up against a white background and took a picture with the Xbox Cam, because you can do custom

30:57.300 --> 30:59.780
gamer pics with the Xbox Live Webcam.

30:59.780 --> 31:02.620
I saw somebody else on my friend�s list, I want to say Rob Way or one of our listeners

31:02.620 --> 31:06.260
has like a glowing Wii logo as his gamer picture.

31:06.260 --> 31:08.620
A lot of people are doing cute things like that.

31:08.620 --> 31:14.100
For a while I had a Mario Kart as my background because you can import themes from pictures

31:14.100 --> 31:18.380
on your computer, so you can do fun little customizable things with your 360 that kind

31:18.380 --> 31:19.380
of make you go, �What?�

31:19.380 --> 31:20.380
I haven�t bothered.

31:20.380 --> 31:23.180
I just have a perfect dark.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.180
That�s fine.

31:25.180 --> 31:29.620
And the one that the public sees, because you only see the camera pictures if you�re

31:29.620 --> 31:31.740
on the friend�s list, but what do I have?

31:31.740 --> 31:34.060
I think I just have one of the Pac-Man ghosts or something.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.300
I change it almost all the time.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.780
I change it like every week.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.620
It�s like my MySpace.

31:38.620 --> 31:40.900
You got to change it all the time to keep it current.

31:40.900 --> 31:41.900
Rob, look.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.900
What?

31:42.900 --> 31:45.380
Oh, you have Pac-Man background on your phone.

31:45.380 --> 31:46.380
That�s cute.

31:46.380 --> 31:47.380
It was a downloadable thing.

31:47.380 --> 31:48.660
Did you pay money for that?

31:48.660 --> 31:49.660
Yeah.

31:49.660 --> 31:50.660
I was bored.

31:50.660 --> 31:51.660
Loser.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.660
When I�m bored, I buy stuff.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.660
All right.

31:53.660 --> 31:54.660
Like most women.

31:54.660 --> 31:55.660
Hey!

31:55.660 --> 31:56.660
Hey, hey, hey.

31:56.660 --> 31:57.660
You�re mad because it�s true.

31:57.660 --> 31:58.660
Can you stop that right now?

31:58.660 --> 31:59.660
Hey, hey, hey.

31:59.660 --> 32:00.660
Yikes.

32:00.660 --> 32:07.020
I just got a bottle thrown at me.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.020
You bitch.

32:08.020 --> 32:09.020
All right.

32:09.020 --> 32:10.020
Rob.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.020
Rob Hart.

32:11.020 --> 32:12.020
Bleeding.

32:12.020 --> 32:13.020
It bleeds for you.

32:13.020 --> 32:15.380
Bleeding black deafness from your heart.

32:15.380 --> 32:16.380
All right.

32:16.380 --> 32:17.500
Anyway, let�s talk about Castlevania.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.580
This is something Jamie and I can agree on.

32:19.580 --> 32:26.300
They showed Castlevania the Dracula X Chronicles for the PSP.

32:26.300 --> 32:29.580
It�s going to be our first Castlevania game that we have on the PSP.

32:29.580 --> 32:33.700
What�s interesting is that elements of it are new, but it�s still kind of an old game.

32:33.700 --> 32:37.260
Basically, what the Dracula X Chronicles are is that you�re going to have this old game,

32:37.260 --> 32:42.340
Rondo of Blood, which they said has never been in the U.S. before.

32:42.340 --> 32:44.140
Never.

32:44.140 --> 32:50.020
It hasn�t, but I can�t stop thinking about Castlevania V. Even though that game was ass,

32:50.020 --> 32:55.060
I mean, really, that game was like the worst Castlevania game they ever made next to 64.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.540
Well, yeah, but in Japan�

32:56.540 --> 33:00.220
Actually, I would rather play Castlevania 64 than Castlevania V.

33:00.220 --> 33:03.140
In Japan, by the way, it was released as Dracula XX.

33:03.140 --> 33:04.140
Right.

33:04.140 --> 33:05.140
Well, so they kind of�

33:05.140 --> 33:06.140
Or death�

33:06.140 --> 33:09.660
Or death, but I mean, after you got past the first stage, a lot of it was different, so

33:09.660 --> 33:11.700
it wasn�t really the same game, but in a way, it was.

33:11.700 --> 33:12.700
But anyway�

33:12.700 --> 33:13.700
I�m watching the trailer.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.780
That�s as much as we got of Rondo of Blood previously.

33:15.780 --> 33:20.540
Well, now we are going to get not only the classic Rondo of Blood game on the PSP, but

33:20.540 --> 33:22.820
they�re redoing it with Upped Graphics, and that�s what they showed�

33:22.820 --> 33:23.820
Oh, this is sexy.

33:23.820 --> 33:24.820
I know.

33:24.820 --> 33:25.820
That�s what they showed at the show.

33:25.820 --> 33:27.220
I�m watching IGNs.

33:27.220 --> 33:30.940
The whole first stage was playable, so we got to play that, and it was awesome.

33:30.940 --> 33:34.060
Now, the thing you have to remember about Rondo of Blood is since�

33:34.060 --> 33:35.060
Did we redo the intro?

33:35.060 --> 33:36.060
Yes.

33:36.060 --> 33:37.060
It�s all CG.

33:37.060 --> 33:38.060
But is it still in Gothic German?

33:38.060 --> 33:39.060
Yes.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.060
I think so.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.060
That thought.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.060
I think.

33:42.060 --> 33:43.060
It was hard to hear sound in there, but I think.

33:43.060 --> 33:47.060
Well, you remember, though, the show where I brought in my turbo duo and hooked it up

33:47.060 --> 33:48.060
and played it on air.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.060
That was in like 2003 or 2004.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.060
It was a long time ago.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.060
Yeah, that was a few years ago.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.060
Yeah, I remember that.

33:52.060 --> 33:54.060
I�ll bring it back one day.

33:54.060 --> 33:56.460
But yeah, it was a sexy game.

33:56.460 --> 33:57.460
It looks great.

33:57.460 --> 34:01.420
I love, love, love the 2D with the 3D look.

34:01.420 --> 34:04.860
I mean, the best thing I could compare it to is like if you�ve played Super Smash

34:04.860 --> 34:09.540
Brothers Melee and you�ve played that mode where you like actually are in the Mario game,

34:09.540 --> 34:13.940
but it�s like all 3D-ified even though it�s 2D, that�s what they did to Rondo of Blood

34:13.940 --> 34:14.940
in this enhanced mode.

34:14.940 --> 34:15.940
It�s great.

34:15.940 --> 34:20.360
Okay, instant impressed points for me.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.780
The game mechanics are the same as 2D.

34:22.780 --> 34:24.540
Yeah, you can do the back flip.

34:24.540 --> 34:25.540
Not just that.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.940
I was checking the timing of the moves.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.060
They�re exactly the same as the PC engine.

34:29.060 --> 34:32.660
It did play a little weird from the Castlevania games I�m used to, but I understand that�s

34:32.660 --> 34:36.300
because the controls handled a little different back then.

34:36.300 --> 34:39.260
Also something you have to remember, since this was before Castlevania the Night, you

34:39.260 --> 34:41.300
cannot just go anywhere you want.

34:41.300 --> 34:46.480
It�s a little more like Castlevania 3 kind of with the branching.

34:46.480 --> 34:49.420
You can kind of branch off in different directions, but that�s about it.

34:49.420 --> 34:53.900
Well, the whole point of the different directions, and I think that for people who aren�t familiar

34:53.900 --> 35:00.220
with Rondo of Blood, is that your ending is affected by how you play the game.

35:00.220 --> 35:02.740
You�ve got secret hidden parts.

35:02.740 --> 35:09.860
For example, a lot of people were wondering who Maria was, who didn�t know any better.

35:09.860 --> 35:14.980
She was actually playable in Rondo of Blood if you rescued her, and all of her attacks

35:14.980 --> 35:21.180
were kind of stupid and cutesy little girly attacks, but they were also based after the

35:21.180 --> 35:23.700
four gods of Chinese mythology, which I thought was pretty funny.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.940
Oh, they redid the graphics for the Uber attacks in this game, too.

35:26.940 --> 35:27.940
Oh, yeah.

35:27.940 --> 35:28.940
It�s nice.

35:28.940 --> 35:33.780
When you play the Saturn version, though, she has the same attacks, only just on a grander

35:33.780 --> 35:34.780
scale.

35:34.780 --> 35:37.180
Symphony of the Night will also be included.

35:37.180 --> 35:40.300
That�s why this is the Dracula X Chronicles, so you get two versions of Rondo of Blood

35:40.300 --> 35:43.420
and Symphony of the Night for one game, and that�s pretty awesome.

35:43.420 --> 35:47.660
Now, they�re not redoing the graphics for Symphony of the Night, but they tease the

35:47.660 --> 35:49.620
idea that they might add new areas.

35:49.620 --> 35:54.380
They�re thinking about going back and retooling that game, and I�m theorizing, why not give

35:54.380 --> 35:55.380
us the Saturn version?

35:55.380 --> 35:59.140
I mean, I realize you can�t really port the Saturn, but give us what the Saturn version

35:59.140 --> 36:00.860
had with Maria and that whole scenario.

36:00.860 --> 36:01.980
That would be awesome.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.180
Or the extra familiars.

36:04.180 --> 36:12.620
For America, it would be an addition, because of course we didn�t get the Saturn version,

36:12.620 --> 36:14.820
and as for the extra familiars, they were useless.

36:14.820 --> 36:17.260
They took them out for a reason, and I�m pretty glad that they did, because they were

36:17.260 --> 36:18.260
stupid.

36:18.260 --> 36:21.620
All it was was another one of the same thing that you already had.

36:21.620 --> 36:23.940
Dude, the item crash is hot.

36:23.940 --> 36:28.380
Ravens Dolphin says, �I thought Dark Sakura would be more excited about this.� Okay,

36:28.380 --> 36:32.540
when she first found out, I think I had to hold the phone about 10 inches away from my

36:32.540 --> 36:37.540
ear, because I was going deaf from the squeaking.

36:37.540 --> 36:44.500
Seriously, when I was watching the trailer, I sat there and actually thought to myself,

36:44.500 --> 36:48.980
�Jamie�s going to piss herself.� I mean, literally, because if you�ve listened to

36:48.980 --> 36:53.540
this show ever since Episode One, Jamie never shuts up about Rondo of Blood, and what a

36:53.540 --> 36:54.540
great game it is.

36:54.540 --> 36:55.540
It�s my copy while we were doing the show, remember?

36:55.540 --> 36:56.540
I do.

36:56.540 --> 37:03.260
Because I had gone to Anime Expo, and to put the long story short, my friend Krista owed

37:03.260 --> 37:07.180
us money for our hotel room, so she came back from Japan with a copy of Dracula X for me

37:07.180 --> 37:09.300
and called it even.

37:09.300 --> 37:12.300
She owed us about $120 and gave us the game.

37:12.300 --> 37:13.380
There you go.

37:13.380 --> 37:14.860
So I have a pretty copy of the game.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.060
Oh my God, this is so hot.

37:16.060 --> 37:18.700
All right, we've got to get to some other games real quick, though, that I got to play.

37:18.700 --> 37:23.460
Honeycomb Beat was another game I played on the DS.

37:23.460 --> 37:26.380
What I like about this puzzle game is it�s kind of different from anything I�ve played.

37:26.380 --> 37:27.700
It�s not like anything on PopCap.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.460
It uses a stylus.

37:29.460 --> 37:33.260
Basically the grid looks like there�s a puzzle mode and a progressive, you know, lines

37:33.260 --> 37:34.540
going up the screen mode.

37:34.540 --> 37:40.940
And basically when you tap the DS stylus on the screen, you flip over all the honeycombs

37:40.940 --> 37:44.540
around the one that you hit, and so that�s kind of like how the puzzle works.

37:44.540 --> 37:46.540
You�re trying to make lines of solid colors.

37:46.540 --> 37:50.460
So it�s one of those easy concept but repeat playability.

37:50.460 --> 37:54.180
Unfortunately there was no sound, so it�s hard for me to judge, like, does it have good

37:54.180 --> 37:55.180
music?

37:55.180 --> 37:56.900
I mean, is this game called Honeycomb Beat?

37:56.900 --> 37:58.780
But it doesn�t really look like the music plays into it at all.

37:58.780 --> 38:02.580
I think beat is just what they call tapping the screen to flip all the things over.

38:02.580 --> 38:06.740
But I think if the price is right on this game, it could be a really good value buy,

38:06.740 --> 38:07.740
I think.

38:07.740 --> 38:11.020
It�s a good solid puzzle game that�s something we haven�t played before.

38:11.020 --> 38:14.820
What�s also going to be a good value is Konami Classics.

38:14.820 --> 38:19.540
The full name of this game on the Nintendo DS is Konami Classics Series Arcades Hits,

38:19.540 --> 38:20.660
but we�ll just call it Konami Classics.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.900
It�s 15 arcade games.

38:22.900 --> 38:23.900
Essentially it�s MAME on your DS.

38:23.900 --> 38:26.060
I don�t know a better way to describe it.

38:26.060 --> 38:31.740
Contra, Gradius, Circus Charlie, Puyan, like all these really, just frankly some obscure

38:31.740 --> 38:32.740
games.

38:32.740 --> 38:35.500
I remember Puyan because it was a game I played on the Commodore 64.

38:35.500 --> 38:40.840
But get this, all the actions on the top screen, but when you pause the game or you tap things

38:40.840 --> 38:45.340
on the bottom screen, not only does the bottom screen show you like the old arcade how to

38:45.340 --> 38:49.020
play banners, which I think is great, like those old things you used to see, like when

38:49.020 --> 38:52.500
you press the button, your thing will fly or whatever it is.

38:52.500 --> 38:59.140
You can also flip the top screen so that you can play in like brain training style mode,

38:59.140 --> 39:01.460
you know, where you�re holding the DS vertically.

39:01.460 --> 39:04.940
So for a more vertically oriented game like Puyan, it works great because you don�t

39:04.940 --> 39:09.140
really stretch the screen like you do if you�re trying to squish it into the more horizontal.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.980
So I thought that was a really smart idea.

39:10.980 --> 39:15.820
So that�s going to be a pretty good value, although granted if you�re an Xbox 360 owner,

39:15.820 --> 39:20.540
a lot of these games you�ve seen on live or probably will be seen on live a little

39:20.540 --> 39:21.540
later.

39:21.540 --> 39:26.360
So a lot of those same games, but you get them on the go on the DS.

39:26.360 --> 39:36.820
The next one I played is the game I can�t pronounce, Kororimpa, Marble Mania on the

39:36.820 --> 39:37.860
Nintendo Wii.

39:37.860 --> 39:41.540
Okay, you remember those old things they had back when we were kids, like those little

39:41.540 --> 39:45.720
marble mazes where you would turn the knobs left and right to move the marble around,

39:45.720 --> 39:48.260
but you didn�t want them to fall in the holes, like you tried to get it all the way

39:48.260 --> 39:49.260
to the end?

39:49.260 --> 39:51.560
That�s this game on the Wii.

39:51.560 --> 39:56.740
You tilt the Wii remote to tilt the grid around, and so you could say in that sense it�s

39:56.740 --> 40:01.220
kind of like Marble Blast Ultra because there�s, you know, like things that get in the way.

40:01.220 --> 40:06.180
Like one round that we played had these giant scissors that closed on the course and you

40:06.180 --> 40:07.660
didn�t want your ball to be in there.

40:07.660 --> 40:12.060
And by the way, your ball could either be a little steel ball, you could be like a soccer

40:12.060 --> 40:15.860
ball, a basketball, or a little penguin ball, of course that�s the one I had to play with.

40:15.860 --> 40:19.420
Not a monkey ball, that�s a different game, I�m sorry, but this game is kind of like

40:19.420 --> 40:23.260
monkey ball I guess, but I actually felt this game controlled a little better than monkey

40:23.260 --> 40:24.260
ball did.

40:24.260 --> 40:27.380
I felt the controls were a little more polished on this game.

40:27.380 --> 40:31.940
So I think if it�s released at a lower price point than your typical Wii game, I think

40:31.940 --> 40:32.940
it�ll be a good buy.

40:32.940 --> 40:36.040
It has multiplayer, and what�s interesting about multiplayer is you only need one Wii

40:36.040 --> 40:40.740
remote because one person uses the Wii, one person uses the nunchuck to control because

40:40.740 --> 40:44.780
you don�t really use buttons or anything, you just tilt the Wiimote around, which is

40:44.780 --> 40:46.720
kind of interesting.

40:46.720 --> 40:47.720
That was that game.

40:47.720 --> 40:54.980
And then Brooktown High was the last thing I played on the PSP, and Brooktown High is

40:54.980 --> 40:57.060
kind of a dating sim game.

40:57.060 --> 41:02.020
It�s Konami basically trying to, what�s that game they had in Japan, Tokenshi Memorial

41:02.020 --> 41:08.300
or what the, Tokimeki Memorial that they have over in Japan, this is them trying this in

41:08.300 --> 41:12.880
the U.S., because you know, Konami sometimes takes a while to try things out that are successful

41:12.880 --> 41:16.620
in Japan over in the U.S., like DDR, but this is them trying that.

41:16.620 --> 41:22.100
And I gotta be honest, I don�t know if this is something I�d buy, but I played another

41:22.100 --> 41:25.700
dating sim called Sprung, which is one of the most god-awful games I�ve ever played

41:25.700 --> 41:29.380
in my life on the Nintendo DS, and this game was leaps and bounds better than that.

41:29.380 --> 41:32.860
So as far as dating sims go, it wasn�t that bad, but I just don�t know if it�s the

41:32.860 --> 41:34.100
kind of game I�m into.

41:34.100 --> 41:39.100
I did like it�s very customizable, you can kind of tell it, you know, what sort of girls

41:39.100 --> 41:43.980
you like and what your personality is like, and you can do a guy dating girls or a girl

41:43.980 --> 41:45.420
dating guys.

41:45.420 --> 41:50.500
Of course you haven�t seen the guys dating guys, but I hear it might be an Easter egg,

41:50.500 --> 41:56.820
but I didn�t get anything official from the developers of the game, but regardless,

41:56.820 --> 42:02.020
you can kind of get your character�s personality built by attending class and by the dialogues

42:02.020 --> 42:03.020
you have.

42:03.020 --> 42:07.200
Like I know they were saying things about if you claim to be a philosopher to impress

42:07.200 --> 42:11.780
a girl, she might call you out on it and ask you a question about philosophy, and if you

42:11.780 --> 42:14.540
don�t know the answer, you�re kind of screwed and you lose cool points with her.

42:14.540 --> 42:17.580
So there are little things like that that are kind of interesting.

42:17.580 --> 42:22.180
And I also thought it was interesting that they had like booth babes there promoting

42:22.180 --> 42:23.180
Brooktown.

42:23.180 --> 42:27.380
It was the only thing they kind of went out and did all these little cheers.

42:27.380 --> 42:30.700
They really went all out for promoting that particular game at the show, which I thought

42:30.700 --> 42:31.700
was interesting.

42:31.700 --> 42:32.700
Yes, Dark Sakura.

42:32.700 --> 42:35.700
I�m totally cosplaying Annette�s outfit.

42:35.700 --> 42:37.420
What, from Castlevania?

42:37.420 --> 42:38.420
Yeah.

42:38.420 --> 42:40.980
Thank you for having nothing to do with what I just said.

42:40.980 --> 42:41.980
No, I�m sorry.

42:41.980 --> 42:45.020
I was still looking at � they had some of the promo art up on GameSpy.

42:45.020 --> 42:46.020
Oh, that�s fine.

42:46.020 --> 42:52.700
I played the Brooktown a little bit, and you know, the only thing that�s disappointing

42:52.700 --> 42:58.900
is having played all the hentai, you know, dating sims out there.

42:58.900 --> 42:59.900
I did like �

42:59.900 --> 43:00.900
What?

43:00.900 --> 43:01.900
You wanted to see 16-year-old Titty?

43:01.900 --> 43:02.900
That�s gross.

43:02.900 --> 43:03.900
No, no.

43:03.900 --> 43:11.980
I hope it had in the game � did you notice in the trailer they had kind of all the symbols

43:11.980 --> 43:17.980
for sex in there, like the rocket taking off and like the oil well going �

43:17.980 --> 43:18.980
Oh, yeah.

43:18.980 --> 43:20.620
I hope the god that�s in the game �

43:20.620 --> 43:25.420
They did this weird-ass thing in the trailer where suddenly pictures of the game were replaced

43:25.420 --> 43:32.180
with these real-life imageries of a flower blooming and a rocket taking off and all this

43:32.180 --> 43:33.180
crazy stuff.

43:33.180 --> 43:37.300
I hope that like, you know, if you go in for a hot coffee or something like that, you know,

43:37.300 --> 43:38.300
that �

43:38.300 --> 43:41.540
This is going to be really random, but did you see the new Psycho?

43:41.540 --> 43:47.540
Like remember when Gus Van Sant remade Psycho, like in 1998 or something, he remade Psycho?

43:47.540 --> 43:53.820
One of the things he did in the death scenes, he added these random-ass clips that had nothing

43:53.820 --> 43:54.820
to do with it.

43:54.820 --> 43:59.580
Like when one person is getting stabbed, like you see a train going through a tunnel and

43:59.580 --> 44:02.500
like the clouds moving by in the sky and it�s like all this random shit.

44:02.500 --> 44:07.100
That�s what that reminded me of, I mean, seriously.

44:07.100 --> 44:13.580
Anyway, that was Brooktown.

44:13.580 --> 44:17.380
Is Chat Room giving you a hard time for being stuck on a Castlevania Dark Sakura?

44:17.380 --> 44:18.380
I don�t care.

44:18.380 --> 44:26.460
I did want to mention that Korinpa and Wing Island are both going to retail for $40 instead

44:26.460 --> 44:27.460
of $50.

44:27.460 --> 44:28.460
Oh, cool.

44:28.460 --> 44:30.660
You picked that up through your distribution thing because they didn�t say that at the

44:30.660 --> 44:31.660
show.

44:31.660 --> 44:36.900
Yeah, I picked it up, you know, I think I mentioned it maybe last week, whatever, but

44:36.900 --> 44:38.900
yeah.

44:38.900 --> 44:42.860
Other games at the show that they had, Death Junior Science Fair of Doom on the DS.

44:42.860 --> 44:44.460
I didn�t see it there.

44:44.460 --> 44:45.460
It was playable.

44:45.460 --> 44:46.740
It�s just not a lot of people were playing it.

44:46.740 --> 44:48.300
Sorry, Death Junior fans.

44:48.300 --> 44:51.220
Go Pets on the Nintendo DS, which is interfaces with the PC.

44:51.220 --> 44:54.600
It�s a DS and PC game, which I thought was interesting.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.420
It looked to me like a cross between Animal Crossing and Nintendogs.

44:57.420 --> 45:01.460
Jamie, you�d probably love this game.

45:01.460 --> 45:03.040
I might love this game.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.040
It looked interesting.

45:04.040 --> 45:07.100
The graphics looked a little rough, but it might have just been early stages.

45:07.100 --> 45:09.380
They didn�t have it playable, just the preview.

45:09.380 --> 45:12.420
Let�s see, you talked about Hellboy already, right?

45:12.420 --> 45:13.420
Yeah.

45:13.420 --> 45:14.540
Lost in Blue 2.

45:14.540 --> 45:15.540
I didn�t like the first one.

45:15.540 --> 45:16.540
I didn�t care about the second one.

45:16.540 --> 45:17.540
Sorry.

45:17.540 --> 45:22.900
I played some of the mini-games, like the goat milking and the � no.

45:22.900 --> 45:26.660
It looks literally exactly like the first one.

45:26.660 --> 45:30.540
Lunar Nights, which we told you about at the F1 with Konami BBQ.

45:30.540 --> 45:37.740
It looks pretty cool still, and Winning Eleven Pro Evo Soccer 2007 looked awesome on the

45:37.740 --> 45:38.740
360.

45:38.740 --> 45:41.100
That game looked � even on the PS2, it looked good.

45:41.100 --> 45:44.500
It looks awesome, but to be honest, I couldn�t get too excited about it because it�s coming

45:44.500 --> 45:45.500
out next week.

45:45.500 --> 45:50.300
I mean, it�s like, why even waste the space with this game?

45:50.300 --> 45:52.740
I mean, it�s coming out next week.

45:52.740 --> 45:53.740
I mean, who cares?

45:53.740 --> 45:54.740
It looked good, though.

45:54.740 --> 45:55.740
I mean, it�s really nice looking.

45:55.740 --> 45:57.140
I don�t really play a lot of sports games.

45:57.140 --> 45:58.540
I�m thinking about picking this one up.

45:58.540 --> 45:59.540
It looks that good.

45:59.540 --> 46:00.540
So, I don�t know.

46:00.540 --> 46:01.540
We�ll see.

46:01.540 --> 46:06.460
Anyway, but we can�t end this story without saying something about the games that weren�t

46:06.460 --> 46:07.460
there.

46:07.460 --> 46:09.060
Of course, Metal Gear Solid 4.

46:09.060 --> 46:14.160
We thought maybe we�d see another trailer, a playable demo, maybe, but nothing, nothing.

46:14.160 --> 46:19.040
No Silent Hill 5, no Silent Hill Origins, no Coded Arms on the PlayStation 3, which

46:19.040 --> 46:22.620
means it is probably true that the game was canceled, we�re thinking, or at least heavily

46:22.620 --> 46:23.620
delayed.

46:23.620 --> 46:27.280
Silent Hill Origins on the PSP vanished into thin air, just like most things in Silent

46:27.280 --> 46:28.280
Hill.

46:28.280 --> 46:32.920
So, very interesting what they didn�t show as much as what they did show.

46:32.920 --> 46:36.660
What do you think about the lineup of Konami Gamers� Day overall, low-key, from being

46:36.660 --> 46:37.860
at the show?

46:37.860 --> 46:40.240
Make more console games.

46:40.240 --> 46:41.740
Stop with all the portable games.

46:41.740 --> 46:42.740
It was very interesting.

46:42.740 --> 46:48.180
Remember when the first marketing lady, or whoever was up there, and I apologize I don�t

46:48.180 --> 46:52.560
have my notes in front of you, she said something about that that�s where all the money is

46:52.560 --> 46:53.560
right now.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.560
Is that DS and PSP?

46:54.560 --> 46:56.860
No, that�s not exactly true though.

46:56.860 --> 46:58.980
Make some more 360 games.

46:58.980 --> 47:03.640
Granted, they had two last year.

47:03.640 --> 47:14.680
They had Rumble Roses XX, and then the follow-up Smash Hit Bomberman, two really awesome games

47:14.680 --> 47:21.280
for the 360, and then this year they�ve got Hellboy, which Hellboy looks good, I�ll

47:21.280 --> 47:23.860
give them that, and DDR Universe.

47:23.860 --> 47:30.160
But put some more games on the 360, oh and I guess Winning Eleven Soccer, that�s great.

47:30.160 --> 47:31.160
So three games this year.

47:31.160 --> 47:33.320
I definitely don�t think we�ve seen everything for the year though.

47:33.320 --> 47:36.920
This is what we� I mean, if you think about last year, we�ve only seen what�s coming

47:36.920 --> 47:40.920
out through like summer, except for some of the DDR Wii won�t be out until the end of

47:40.920 --> 47:43.880
the year, and some of those other ones, but most of the stuff is going to be out in summer.

47:43.880 --> 47:47.000
Most of what they showed was going to be out in March, and I think we already talked about

47:47.000 --> 47:52.000
most of that, but I mean, oh goody, so we�re going to see Karaoke Revolution, whatever

47:52.000 --> 47:54.920
the next one is, on the 360 come fall.

47:54.920 --> 47:59.520
SSJ100Matt says, �Kojima probably wants to take his time with Metal Gear Solid 4 since

47:59.520 --> 48:02.400
it�s his last one.� Yeah, he says that every time, dude.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.960
He says that every time.

48:03.960 --> 48:06.320
Bullseye is his last one.

48:06.320 --> 48:07.760
There�s money to be made.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.760
He�ll come back.

48:08.760 --> 48:12.560
Jamie, I know unfortunately you didn�t get to go because of school, but what do you think

48:12.560 --> 48:15.560
from the perspective of getting to read all about this?

48:15.560 --> 48:19.480
Are you excited about all this, or beyond just Castlevania?

48:19.480 --> 48:21.440
Dracula X.

48:21.440 --> 48:26.000
I really don�t care about anything but Dracula X, really.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Nothing in the world.

48:27.000 --> 48:33.680
No Super Bowl, no Koro Impa.

48:33.680 --> 48:42.240
That one sounds interesting, but my excitement over Dracula X is phenomenal, monumental,

48:42.240 --> 48:47.800
bigger than a mole in terms of chemistry.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.600
The creator of Castlevania was there.

48:49.600 --> 48:50.600
I know it.

48:50.600 --> 48:51.600
I hugged him.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.600
He is still a fucking rock star.

48:52.600 --> 48:53.600
I hugged him.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.440
He came out and said, �I got a new hat.� Put on his new hat.

48:56.440 --> 48:58.240
I have a picture of him, remember?

48:58.240 --> 48:59.240
Yeah, I know.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.240
We ran into him in E3.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.240
I remember that.

49:01.240 --> 49:02.240
I know.

49:02.240 --> 49:03.240
I have all the celebrity run-ins.

49:03.240 --> 49:07.480
I want to mention some things that slipped under that most people didn�t talk about.

49:07.480 --> 49:12.360
There were some of the new lineups that they set for their plug-and-play stuff.

49:12.360 --> 49:16.560
One of them, which was really big and I�m surprised I didn�t pick, Music Mania, which

49:16.560 --> 49:20.160
I don�t know if it�s Beat Mania or pop music or something, but they have a three

49:20.160 --> 49:24.240
and five key mode, and it�s basically a music rhythm game.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.240
Even I missed this.

49:25.240 --> 49:28.920
It was on the CD with the press stuff.

49:28.920 --> 49:31.240
We�ll have to do a write-up on that and look at that.

49:31.240 --> 49:32.560
What about the track and field?

49:32.560 --> 49:37.680
I thought they have a plug-and-go track and field guild, like a power pad, old NES type

49:37.680 --> 49:38.680
thing.

49:38.680 --> 49:39.680
Very interesting.

49:39.680 --> 49:40.680
I guess you could burn a lot of calories with that.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.680
That�s what they�re encouraging.

49:42.680 --> 49:49.280
Speaking of burning calories and also DDR, there was a study going on by the West Virginia

49:49.280 --> 49:55.800
Public Employees Insurance Agency where they had, it was a 24-week at-home clinical study

49:55.800 --> 50:01.960
where they had people play DDR five days a week for at least 30 minutes and record their

50:01.960 --> 50:02.960
activity.

50:02.960 --> 50:03.960
They had to help monitors.

50:03.960 --> 50:10.360
They were tracking weight, blood pressure, arterial function, fitness level, BMI, and

50:10.360 --> 50:14.220
general attitude toward exercise.

50:14.220 --> 50:19.440
These studies came by, and see, all their studies, by the way, were above the 85th percent

50:19.440 --> 50:23.320
offer body mass index.

50:23.320 --> 50:30.240
Not all of them lost weight, but almost all of them were showing improved arterial function.

50:30.240 --> 50:35.160
They were showing general levels of well-being improved.

50:35.160 --> 50:41.800
The biggest thing on here, I thought, was confidence and self-esteem improved.

50:41.800 --> 50:46.860
They were more willing to participate in activity because they were so active and had more faith

50:46.860 --> 50:49.400
in their bodies and their capabilities.

50:49.400 --> 50:54.740
In other words, it took this big study to prove that exercise, no matter in what form

50:54.740 --> 51:03.120
it is, DDR or weightlifting or whatever it is, exercise is healthy?

51:03.120 --> 51:09.360
We know exercise is healthy, but I think that taking something that makes it really fun

51:09.360 --> 51:17.760
because in the average person's mind, I think, they're not going to see, oh, I'm exercising.

51:17.760 --> 51:21.800
I can tell you from personal experience, I get weirded out with the idea of going to

51:21.800 --> 51:22.800
the gym.

51:22.800 --> 51:28.680
There's something about that whole public sweating thing and the whole body builders.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.340
There's all those muscular people and everything.

51:30.340 --> 51:33.840
There's kind of that big fear that kind of goes with the gym and intimidation that comes

51:33.840 --> 51:34.840
with that.

51:34.840 --> 51:38.680
You don't have that when you're playing DDR because it's like just playing a video game.

51:38.680 --> 51:42.240
Even though there's a whole different side of it, like if you're playing at the arcade,

51:42.240 --> 51:45.400
people call you gay or whatever, but fuck them.

51:45.400 --> 51:47.720
It's about the fact that you're having fun with it.

51:47.720 --> 51:48.720
I haven't kicked out.

51:48.720 --> 51:49.720
I know.

51:49.720 --> 51:50.720
That was the good old days at Roseville Golf Land.

51:50.720 --> 51:51.720
We all used to go.

51:51.720 --> 51:54.400
But, anyway, DDR is kind of different than that.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.680
DDR is just kind of like having fun.

51:55.680 --> 51:58.200
It's like, hey, we're playing a video game, making asses of ourselves.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.200
That's funny.

51:59.200 --> 52:00.200
It's healthy.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.200
I miss Para Para.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.200
Oh, yeah.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.680
That was a good one, too.

52:03.680 --> 52:07.880
I think the Para Para was more of a good aerobic workout than just DDR is because you

52:07.880 --> 52:09.680
move in your arms with it.

52:09.680 --> 52:10.680
It's a lot more.

52:10.680 --> 52:13.000
Well, maybe that's what they hope to accomplish with this Wii thing.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.920
Well, at any rate, there's a little bit more to this that I think is cool is the Office

52:17.920 --> 52:20.200
of West Virginia Governor.

52:20.200 --> 52:25.800
Actually, it looks like there's an association with the Department of Education and a few

52:25.800 --> 52:33.240
other facilities, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield, are giving some financial support

52:33.240 --> 52:39.920
to eventually lead this into DDR games, training PE teachers, and promoting DDR clubs in West

52:39.920 --> 52:42.440
Virginia public schools.

52:42.440 --> 52:46.440
And Konami gets all the profits, but that's okay because it keeps new DDR games coming

52:46.440 --> 52:49.160
out at home, and as long as they stay innovative, hey, they're fine by me.

52:49.160 --> 52:54.000
I just laugh for all those people who say, oh, DDR won't work in America.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.960
I bet you feel so stupid now.

52:57.960 --> 52:59.160
Well, you know what?

52:59.160 --> 53:02.440
This news is so huge that they even covered it on the national news.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.440
Did you hear that?

53:03.440 --> 53:04.440
Really?

53:04.440 --> 53:05.440
Yes.

53:05.440 --> 53:06.440
I have a clip.

53:06.440 --> 53:07.440
Hold on.

53:07.440 --> 53:12.880
Researchers in West Virginia announced Friday the results of a study that suggests playing

53:12.880 --> 53:18.920
the video game Dance Dance Revolution improves the health of overweight kids, though not

53:18.920 --> 53:22.720
as much as its rival game, Hamburger on a String.

53:22.720 --> 53:23.720
Okay.

53:23.720 --> 53:27.840
Obviously, that was from Saturday Night Live.

53:27.840 --> 53:31.880
It's still kind of funny, nonetheless, to see a little DDR joke make its way into Weekend

53:31.880 --> 53:32.880
Update there.

53:32.880 --> 53:33.880
I like Hamburger on a String.

53:33.880 --> 53:34.880
And who doesn't love?

53:34.880 --> 53:36.680
I miss Kevin Nealon doing the Weekend Update.

53:36.680 --> 53:38.920
Yeah, but I love Amy Poehler.

53:38.920 --> 53:39.920
I love her.

53:39.920 --> 53:40.920
She's fine.

53:40.920 --> 53:41.920
Not as good as Tina Fey, but I love her.

53:41.920 --> 53:42.920
She was with Upright Citizens Brigade.

53:42.920 --> 53:43.920
But anyway.

53:43.920 --> 53:44.920
Hamburger on a String.

53:44.920 --> 53:45.920
Ha!

53:45.920 --> 53:46.920
I miss Chevy Chase, too.

53:46.920 --> 53:47.920
I know.

53:47.920 --> 53:53.000
So, you know, we all know that the PlayStation 3 resembles a George Foreman grill or a grill

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
of some sort.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Yeah.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.560
In fact, people have gone as far as making it into an actual grill.

53:57.560 --> 54:07.000
Well, now there's this one retailer in Akihabara that's selling some unofficial 6-axis soy

54:07.000 --> 54:09.760
sauce to go with the PlayStation 3 grill.

54:09.760 --> 54:11.720
That's kind of a joke.

54:11.720 --> 54:19.960
They've basically rebranded some of the Bulldog brand soy sauce and, yeah, it's actually quite

54:19.960 --> 54:20.960
funny.

54:20.960 --> 54:26.280
They feature it in the smaller 20GB size or the larger 60GB size.

54:26.280 --> 54:30.080
Is it $599 US dollars?

54:30.080 --> 54:31.560
Is it made from giant enemy crabs?

54:31.560 --> 54:32.560
No.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.280
All these jokes will never get old.

54:34.280 --> 54:43.080
It's actually, it's being sold at Sagatsu Isagi and it's being retailed for 3.99 yen

54:43.080 --> 54:48.760
marked down from 4.99 yen and 5.99 yen for the larger one.

54:48.760 --> 54:53.080
And it's kind of funny, though, because it has a picture of Ken Kataragi on the front

54:53.080 --> 54:54.080
there.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.080
Eating crabs?

54:55.080 --> 54:56.080
And it also has a picture of...

54:56.080 --> 55:00.480
The PlayStation 3 with the top lifted up with the grill on it.

55:00.480 --> 55:04.200
To be honest, I think that would be pretty cool if there was a grill on it because then

55:04.200 --> 55:10.160
you could eat and watch a Blu-ray movie at the same time.

55:10.160 --> 55:18.680
If anyone doesn't know, Akihabara is the technical district, I guess, where you can buy all of

55:18.680 --> 55:22.000
your techie goods and now barbecue sauce.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.400
I really want to buy barbecue sauce when I go buy a stereo.

55:25.400 --> 55:30.840
DJ Jenai says, 6-axis equals most innovative controller ever.

55:30.840 --> 55:33.240
PS3 is the best.

55:33.240 --> 55:37.960
Glad to know we have some Sony fans in chat because sometimes it feels like there are

55:37.960 --> 55:43.040
no Sony fans left in the world, so I'm glad to see somebody is still standing behind them.

55:43.040 --> 55:46.520
Anyhow, certainly these guys are fans of Sony.

55:46.520 --> 55:52.320
They just express their fanboyism in a different way because it's, let's see, who did this?

55:52.320 --> 56:00.520
On the first day that firmware 3.10 came out, it got cracked.

56:00.520 --> 56:01.520
That's kind of funny.

56:01.520 --> 56:06.740
This was cracked by team C plus D and basically what happened is that of course they released

56:06.740 --> 56:10.720
the new firmware just a few days ago and it got cracked right in the same day by this

56:10.720 --> 56:15.240
team who works hard to crack the games, I'm sorry, to crack the firmware so that you can

56:15.240 --> 56:18.600
still continue to play your old school Nintendo games on your PS3.

56:18.600 --> 56:29.520
And they've already come out with custom firmware for 3.1, so great, now you can actually install

56:29.520 --> 56:34.360
the custom firmware, play all your updated games, and still be able to play your wonderful

56:34.360 --> 56:37.120
NES ROMs.

56:37.120 --> 56:42.760
DJ Jenai says, continuous is Sony fanboyism, saying, come on, Sony does what Nintendon't,

56:42.760 --> 56:48.800
the Rob D counters with, everyone stands behind Sony, to laugh at them behind their back.

56:48.800 --> 56:54.440
Rama says, I'll wait for the PS3 to be redesigned in retail for $149, give it six more months.

56:54.440 --> 56:55.440
Ouch.

56:55.440 --> 57:01.360
All right, any more PlayStation stories?

57:01.360 --> 57:04.280
I suppose I have some information.

57:04.280 --> 57:05.280
Okay.

57:05.280 --> 57:06.280
Some.

57:06.280 --> 57:13.120
Well, there's a little game that spawned a very interesting little music video called

57:13.120 --> 57:16.120
Saints Row.

57:16.120 --> 57:22.360
It's been confirmed that it will be going on to PS3, it's saying that sometime this

57:22.360 --> 57:30.280
spring it will have PlayStation Network support, and so that means multiplayer online.

57:30.280 --> 57:36.800
There was a mention, however, if they're going to have any additional content.

57:36.800 --> 57:43.240
Speaking of Saints Row, and that game had some CD parts in it, well, if you happen to

57:43.240 --> 57:49.560
be in some of the CD parts of Japan, you too can play the PlayStation 3 in one of Japan's

57:49.560 --> 57:55.000
love hotels, and yes, that is one of those brothel hotels.

57:55.000 --> 58:05.880
Casa Di Du in Shibuya, Tokyo, they have, with, I guess, your stay at these love hotels, you

58:05.880 --> 58:10.620
can be able to play PlayStation 3 for free.

58:10.620 --> 58:15.440
So I guess that's great, but at the same time, you know, I would be thinking, if you're staying

58:15.440 --> 58:20.480
at a love hotel, wouldn't you be going there for sex and not to play the PlayStation 3?

58:20.480 --> 58:24.920
Or is Sony trying to tell me the PlayStation 3 is better than sex?

58:24.920 --> 58:28.520
Or is it one of those things where it's like, okay, I'm going here, and not only will I

58:28.520 --> 58:32.700
get a hot chick to sleep with me, or borderline hot chick to sleep with me, but she'll play

58:32.700 --> 58:33.700
games with me?

58:33.700 --> 58:36.240
Well, love hotels aren't really just that.

58:36.240 --> 58:42.280
They're also where people meet for rendezvous with their significant other.

58:42.280 --> 58:49.760
And then all she would have to do is bake me a pie, and it's like the full thing.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.280
I just wanted to get the death glare from Jamie.

58:51.280 --> 58:53.880
I thought that was interesting, though.

58:53.880 --> 59:00.280
I mean, I guess that's pretty cool, because after you've done it, then you can play video

59:00.280 --> 59:01.280
games.

59:01.280 --> 59:04.320
And it's just like you never left home.

59:04.320 --> 59:08.960
Going back to a previous story in chat, reading some comments here, Mike W. says, it was decrypted

59:08.960 --> 59:11.400
day one, talking about the firmware.

59:11.400 --> 59:12.400
Then it was cracked.

59:12.400 --> 59:13.400
Fault story, whatever.

59:13.400 --> 59:18.440
I don't care if OLR gets it wrong.

59:18.440 --> 59:23.840
Regardless, having the firmware get fucked with on day one, and having some form of security,

59:23.840 --> 59:28.600
to obsess with it, whether it be decryption or whatever it is, has got to say something.

59:28.600 --> 59:33.120
And it didn't take much longer after that, anyway.

59:33.120 --> 59:37.600
Ramas Bolden says, PlayStation 3 equals Sony's final console.

59:37.600 --> 59:41.920
The Rob D says, what would you listen to in a love hotel while playing video games?

59:41.920 --> 59:44.840
I want you to watch me play Madden Skip from Mad TV.

59:44.840 --> 59:50.280
I don't know if you've ever seen that, but it's kind of funny.

59:50.280 --> 59:53.960
Ravens Dolphin says, Loki is going there with Nelly to a love hotel.

59:53.960 --> 59:56.720
No, I wouldn't be going there.

59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.720
Why would I travel all the way to Japan to go to a love hotel?

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.720
That's ridiculous.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.720
All right.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:10.640
Well, speaking of good lovin', there's this interesting thing here in Utah.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:15.960
They have that games as porn bill that keeps trying to pass over and over again.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:22.480
Well, unfortunately, the State House Committee of Utah voted to hold the legislation for

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:27.840
the third time the other day, and the reason is freedom of speech.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.400
So of course, what they were trying to do is try to change it to say that Utah was going

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.080
to be basically had to be sold as like pornography does.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.640
Let's see, Republican Kay McCliff had this to say, I am concerned when all the legal

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.020
experts including our own Attorney General as well as the sponsor tell us that the bill

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:49.160
is likely to fail in a constitutional challenge, one where we cannot control the amount we

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.840
spend because we spend our side and then we are potentially obliged to spend the legal

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.760
costs of the other side.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.360
Kay is trying to draft a substitute bill to replace the original.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.360
Leave it to a Republican.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.000
Well, you know, I don't want to turn this into a political war, but it's just general

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.600
ignorance, I think, about the gaming community from everyone, and I think a lot of folks

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.140
could stand to be educated no matter who you are or how you vote.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.140
I think a lot of-

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.140
But mostly Republicans.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.600
I think a lot of people just don't get it.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.280
I'm just giving y'all a hard time.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.280
All right.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.840
Well, but there is- I have some- I do have some news about someone who has his head up

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.120
his ass that makes me happy, speaking of, you know, Republicans.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.680
Sorry, I won't go off on Republicans anymore.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:39.840
There- Okay, sorry, there was some debate going on.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840
Can we start over, please?

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.840
Yes.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.840
Okay, thank you.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:51.680
Um, speaking of someone who has, uh, his head up his ass, um, he who shall not be named

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:57.800
except right now, Jack Thompson, um, has been, um, called on yet another complaint with the

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.800
Florida Bar.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.240
Um, it's- Oh my God.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:09.400
Anyway, there's a pending judicial review, um, for five counts of professional misconduct

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.600
against, uh, dumbass.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.920
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be, you know, impersonal, right, um, against, uh, he who shall not be

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:22.320
named to be, um, actually he's supposed to be going to the, uh, State Supreme Court,

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.440
uh, for, uh, action.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.440
That's pretty cool.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:31.040
But the, uh, quote on here, um, says, uh, in the suit, uh, he who shall not be named

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:35.800
represented the families of two Fayette, Alabama police officers and a police dispatcher murdered

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.120
by an 18-year-old grand theft auto player in 2003.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.300
At the time of his arrest for the killings, Devin Moore reportedly said, life is like

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.920
a video game, you have to die sometime.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.200
More subsequently convicted of the murders now sits on Alabama's death row.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.760
He who shall not be named was not involved in the criminal case against Moore.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:03:00.400
Um, yeah, honestly, the other, the other, um, two complaints actually have to do with,

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:08.520
um, the attacks he made, um, on shock radio in South Florida and, um, you know, I'm just

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.520
so disgusted.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.760
Really, I, I hope that, I hope that he is disbarred.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.800
I hope this is the end of it.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.160
And we never- That would be awesome if we never had to report

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.160
on him again.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.080
That would be the best thing ever.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.080
I'd hold a party.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.000
Uh, Rama and Shay, I think, I think we would- You know what?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.280
If this happens, we should throw a party.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.560
We absolutely should throw a party.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:36.200
We have a special party edition of Orange Lounge Radio, um, celebrating the vanquishment

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.520
of he who shall not be named.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.520
We'll get guests and everything.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.560
I bet you anything, because, you know, gamer Andy was a big part of that flower and he

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.560
doesn't live that far away.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.560
I bet you we could get him here to join our party.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.280
We'll get, we'll invite some, we'll get, we'll hold a big, massive frickin' party if this

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280
happens.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.280
We'll play World Combat Armageddon.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.280
Yes.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280
Custom characters.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.520
We'll play nothing but video games where we put Jack Tonsom in them, Tonsom in them.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.880
What about the, uh, the Combine game?

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.280
Sure, we'll play that too.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.280
Why not?

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280
We'll play that too.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.880
And, and, and, and, and- That'll piss him off.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.320
And our Music of Choice's Two Life crew and Ice-T.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.320
Bring it on!

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.320
I love this idea!

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.320
You know what?

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.320
I think we should have this party anyway!

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:16.120
No, but we're, okay, the party only happens if he gets disbarred.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.120
Okay?

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.280
Is that, is that the criteria?

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.840
If he gets disbarred- If he gets disbarred-

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.740
In the state of Florida, OLR, he lost his licensed party.

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.000
He who shall not be named is vanquished.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.880
However, if he is not disbarred, we send him a bag of poo in the mail.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.880
No, no, no.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.880
We're not children.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.880
Come on.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:41.960
Maybe we could call this bar is open party.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.520
Going to the chatroom, Rama says, isn't he who shall not be named Voldemort?

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.600
So should we start- So do you, do you see the metaphor here?

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.720
Should we start calling him Jack- Should that be his new nickname, Jack Voldemort?

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.560
Jack Voldemort.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.080
I love that idea.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.680
He is just he who shall not be named.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.320
From here on out, we are calling him Jack Voldemort.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.320
I love that idea.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.840
And by the way, the reason why I brought up Two Life Crew and Ice-T is that he was also

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:13.040
instrumental in the whole, you know, the cop killer scandal for Ice-T and for Two Life

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.640
Crew's as nasty as they want to be.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.640
Wasn't that what it was called?

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.760
And we'll also listen to Howard Stern because- Yes, we should copy it and send it to Howard

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.760
Stern.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.440
Oh, I love this idea.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.440
Here's hoping.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.320
Would this all happen like next week if it happens?

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320
I missed the dates in there.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.320
I hope it happens.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.920
I don't think the dates were listed.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.460
Everything in the legal thing is a slow process.

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.460
We'll see.

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.960
I'll have to check my legal sites.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.960
All right.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.120
Anyway, any time, you know, it's become tradition on this program.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:48.440
Any time a story about Jack Voldemort comes up, you know what's going to happen next.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.600
That's right.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:58.680
It's our chance to rant about whatever we want.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.240
It's the FUs of the week.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.800
Get it out of your system, Darkstalker.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.280
I have two.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.000
The first one, FU to my uterus.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.520
Next one is an FU to Roseville, Mitsubishi, you bastards.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.520
Okay.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.520
This is what happens.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:28.200
My husband has a 2006 Lancer- Oh god, what Lancer does he have?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.200
A rally art, sorry.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.000
So it's like a model under the evolution.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.920
It's a nice, nice car.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:40.240
And he uses it to go to work, and he uses it, you know, sometimes for a couple of Bay

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.240
Area trips.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.120
He doesn't drive it really crazily.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:49.800
I drive more violently than he does, and my car is still in good shape.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.600
Well, the transmission blew.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:57.880
And he had, you know, a car with only 15,000 miles on it, he's only had it for a year.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.720
There's no reason for a transmission to go out that quickly.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.200
So he took it to Roseville, Mitsubishi.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.280
And Bob Coffee, what I was saying is that it's the step under the Evo.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.280
Listen to what I said.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.680
Hi.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.360
And the FU to my uterus is for PMS.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.680
But anyway, back to the car.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:32.040
When he took it in, this was, the car first of all has the 10 year warranty on it, bumper

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.920
to bumper warranty.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:39.760
So he took the car in, and they said, well, you know, we have to strip it down to look

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:44.080
at the transmission, and if it's your fault, you pay $1100 to fix it.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.640
Well, first of all, if you don't drive your car like shit, then there's no reason for

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.920
the transmission to go out.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:58.000
So he said, to hell with that, and said, you're not going to charge me for taking it apart,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.760
you're going to do the diagnostic on it.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.160
Like fine, then the warranty won't cover it.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:10.120
So he gets on the line with the, I guess the Mitsubishi corporate, they have a big stink

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120
over it.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:19.000
He said the customer service girl was friendly, but said that the caseworker was all like,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.320
hey look, we're going to have them break down the car for free, it's our dime, which they

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:27.960
should have done in the first place, hi!

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:34.680
And then they said if they determine the transmission thing is his fault, then they'll put it back

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.760
together for free, and let him take it wherever he feels that he needs to to pay less for

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.760
it.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:51.120
So, if I start talking about how much I love my new WRX STI, you'll find out what happened.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.280
We had some, I'm reading comments from chat, we had someone named the uterus join chat,

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.080
that says don't let your uterus drive your car.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.640
And Rama says fucking cunt, and I'm going to say don't talk to Jamie like that, that's

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.640
rude.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.640
Can I talk to, no, no, no.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.520
I know, he was saying someone else.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.480
Let's see, and then also, but Rama did say this, which I thought was really funny.

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:16.000
He said, so if Jack equals Voldemort, that means that Jamie equals Hermione, Sky equals

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.720
Harry, and Loki equals Ron.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:24.520
Dude, that means that I get Victor Crumb, and then the movie gets kind of hot.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.160
What do I get, Cho Chang?

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.280
Hippity doo da, alright, anyway, was that it?

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.280
Are you and your uterus done?

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:36.160
Except she was really cool with this being, having that thick Scottish accent, I totally

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.160
did it, it's perfect.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.960
Are you and your uterus finished?

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.280
I wish that men had cramps.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.600
We do get cramps in a different story.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.840
I wish that men had hormone related cramps.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.240
I would love it.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.560
Maybe someday you can have balls.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.960
You'd all be big babies.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.600
And so I can kick you in them.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.840
Alright, uh, Loki, well I wish we could drive better, but we don't always get what we want,

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840
do we now?

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.840
You know what?

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.840
Fuck you.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.200
We did figure out why, we did figure out though why women drive bad, it's because estrogen

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.200
causes you to have, you know, I don't know, some sort of balance problems, or like, you

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.840
know, the world spins or something, I don't know, we're just going to use that as an excuse

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.840
for now.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.840
I drive really well.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.120
There's going to be a fight in the parking lot after the show.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120
I drive rough.

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120
What?

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.440
I drive really well.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.120
You drive like a bat out of hell, I mean, you do get us from point A to point B the

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.120
quickest way possible.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.120
I'll give you that.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:42.200
But, I don't cut people off, I don't talk on my phone while I drive, I'm like somebody

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.200
in this room.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.560
You cast hexes on people when you drive.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.720
And they get out of my way.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.720
Loki, finish.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:57.080
Um, I don't even remember what my FU of the week was to, uh, so yeah, I'm just going to

01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:01.640
say bad to women drivers because there's been a lot of them, especially driving slow or

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.440
that, you know, they can't seem to, you know, navigate that minivan, you know, it's like

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.440
if you can't fucking drive a car, just stay at home.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:15.280
Just fuck everybody who drives a minivan that doesn't need one of those.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.720
And I swear to god I fucking hate people that drive, you know, SUVs, off-road vehicles,

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.800
mind you, that have to go over the fucking speed bumps like it's, like their car's made

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.800
of glass.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:30.280
It's a fucking off-road car, it should be able to handle this damn little speed bump.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.880
I know my car could go over that super fast.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.880
Why can't yours?

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.240
Oh my god, I'm having to loop the music, we're going to six minutes here.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.120
Actually, I have one, I have one more thing.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.120
Oh goody.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120
I have one more.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120
Alright.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.000
FU to people who think that just because you're married you need to start breeding.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Moooo.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Moooo.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.840
First of all, children do not save a marriage.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.400
It makes it worse.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.280
Secondly, if you can't afford...

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.680
This is episode part FU, because that's all this segment's going to be.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.720
Secondly, if you cannot afford the child, don't have one.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:13.440
Thirdly, if I say I don't want children, fucking respect what I have to say.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.920
Don't keep pushing it until I go puke in the bathroom at Cattleman's.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.560
Thank you.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.560
Can I do my FUs now?

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.560
No.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.560
Do I get to do my FUs?

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560
Okay, fine.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560
Alright.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.880
So my FU of the week also goes to Jamie's uterus, and then I would like to say an FU.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.880
Just kidding.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.880
Heart.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880
I don't think she heard me.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.880
My uterus, my choice.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.360
I would also like to give an FU, and it's my choice to say FU.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360
Just kidding.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.360
Heart.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.360
Love you.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.200
No, seriously though, I want to say FU to dentistry, because oh my god, my dental bills.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.720
And it's not like my teeth are that awful.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.360
I don't think I have, like I've not got some crazy thing going on, like a gap or anything.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.680
It's just like, oh my god, I have so much money, and I can't afford her dental stuff,

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.400
so it sucks.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.320
And then I got like a temporary crown way in the back where you can't even see it, and

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.840
it fell out two days after I got it.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.840
I mean, come on.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.760
I just feel like every time, I feel like going to the dentist is like going to used car salesmen

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:07.760
sometimes.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.760
There's so much pressure.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.760
No wonder people are afraid of the dentist.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.760
I'm not afraid of the dentist.

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.760
I just fall asleep.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.080
It's not just, it's not the drill work I'm afraid of.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.560
I'm afraid of the way they treat people.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.560
Anyway.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560
You should go to my dentist.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.560
She's really cool.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.560
I don't think my insurance will let me.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.560
That's a whole other FU.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.560
FU to your testicles, by the way.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560
Thank you.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.560
Oh, sure, sure, anytime.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.560
FU, Jamie.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.640
Thank god, this is radio.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.880
Your testicles sound like Grover.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.280
Well they're blue.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.080
Welcome to octaves of Jamie that you normally don't listen.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.880
I don't know if it's picking up because she doesn't have the mic near her, but she's going

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:58.040
to listen about three octaves higher than we usually hear.

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:12.600
On this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, giggling schoolgirls, near, far, near, far.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.240
Thank god this is radio.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:21.800
Speaking of near and far, one game that's near dear to my heart, Grand Theft Auto, is

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:28.080
doing really well far away in Japan, where Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has taken number

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.760
one in their sales charts.

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.760
That is right.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.280
Beating out such DS titles as those brain training things.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.280
Fuck brain training.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.480
It's all about killing hookers.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:42.600
That's really what Japan needs, and god damn it, they just got their dose of killing hookers.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.320
So way to go Japan.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.680
You just need to get on the bandwagon now with Grand Theft Auto IV, then I could be

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:53.160
killing more hookers from Japan.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:57.640
Kevin DDR says, what, GTA can't do well in Japan?

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.000
It's doing well now.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
It's number one.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.840
But I mean, should that be such a big deal?

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.840
I mean, it's number one here.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.680
Was it not allowed to do well in there?

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.560
Usually US games don't do very well in Japan.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:14.080
So I would think, you know, that, you know.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.320
Rob says, sounds like the OLR crew just got ahold of the wacky weed.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.320
No, we don't.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.160
I don't know about the other two, but I don't really do that.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:23.840
Drinking's fine, but we're not drunk either tonight, and only when drinking responsibly.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.840
So.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.840
Rob.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.840
Winners don't use drugs.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:27.840
Remember the FBI warning.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.840
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:29.840
What?

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:30.840
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:31.840
What?

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:32.840
Never do that again.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.740
It was funny and you know it.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:36.920
Never do that.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:45.520
Speaking of blue things, Sonic the Hedgehog is, had a funny little misprint on Amazon

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.480
and a little screen shot made its way to Kotaku this week and they labeled the story Sonic

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:55.160
the Vacuum Cleaner because they put a little picture of Sonic the Hedgehog under Dirt Devil

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.520
Upright Vacuum.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:01.000
Obviously this is some type of database mistake, but it makes people LOL nonetheless because

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.480
it's kind of funny to see things wrong like that.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:11.120
Like remember when they were selling the Wii for like $1,119 or whatever was the release

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.120
date?

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120
Somebody screwed up the database?

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.120
Something similar happened here.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.000
Maybe they just found out that Sonic the Hedgehog sucked?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Haha!

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.280
I see what you did there because I hadn't heard that joke a million times already on

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.280
Kotaku.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.540
Speaking of games that suck, Unexpected.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.400
This is like totally rad.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:40.080
The Burger King had, they reported higher than anticipated quarterly earnings because

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.140
of the Xbox 360 promo games, at least that's what they figured.

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:51.600
The games actually pulled sales up to $38 million in the US alone.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:58.240
And so, how can these games have gone double platinum?

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.560
I guess with the fact that they were $4 a piece.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:06.080
Because there are 2 million achievement point whores in the world who just needed the extra

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.160
600 points that these games would give is actually what happened.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160
I guess.

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.160
They are also now $0.99 each.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.360
I heard about that, that's crazy.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.000
So if you haven't bought them yet.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.680
There are two that I still need, I only have Sneak King.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:24.920
Yeah, if you haven't bought it yet, might as well do it, because $0.99, that's not bad

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:25.920
for a game.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:26.920
Even if it does suck.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.960
You can collect collector's things before too long.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.560
It will be as rare as Rondo of Blood, okay maybe not.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.960
But nowhere near as awesome.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.680
Let's hear what games are coming out very soon that could soon become collector's items.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.720
Do you have any exclusives for us this week, Loki, on release dates?

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:50.520
No, because I took time off work and there wasn't really much to mention anyway.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.520
We mentioned everything probably last week and anything exclusive would have been at

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.560
Konami's Gamer Day and all that fun stuff.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.640
What was I going to say though?

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.240
But this week though, there's some good stuff coming out.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:06.600
If you are a fan of Winning Eleven, you'll be happy to know that that is finally making

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:13.240
its way out now on PlayStation 2, on the 360, DS, and PSP.

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.560
So that's pretty awesome.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.520
Also there's going to be, actually there's not a lot of PlayStation 2 games coming out

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.760
this week, I know that for a fact.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.500
I do believe the Final Fantasy VI comes out on the Game Boy Advance this week, which is

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.060
pretty awesome.

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:37.160
So definitely check that out, because I know, what is it, Five did really well, everybody's

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.640
picking up Five.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:45.360
There should be some more Wii's and DS Lite's coming to, I want to say to all the retailers

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.600
this week as well, because I know they've been out of stock for a long time.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:55.440
They were actually sold out on Nintendo for the last two weeks.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:02.460
Other than that stuff, wow, it was just a whole lot of crap coming out this week.

01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:06.320
So I want to say that's probably what I'd really, oh, how could I forget this, Diddycom

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.320
Racing DS, that's coming out.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320
So if you know.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320
I've been seeing commercials for that.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.400
If you want to get your fix on a Mario Kart type racing game, and this is kind of cool,

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.400
they've got a create your own track mode, you basically draw a track with the stylus,

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:25.520
so that's kind of neat, R. Tonleko on Playstation 2, another Atlus RPG, so definitely worth

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.520
checking out.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:32.200
If you're into puzzle games, Capcom Puzzle World on the PSP, so that was pretty fun,

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.280
because it has Puzzle Fighter on it.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:39.800
Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI on Playstation 2, if you're a fan of that.

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.560
And then MVP07 NCAA Baseball if you're into college baseball on Playstation 2.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.480
I just want to say release date wise, because I don't know if you explicitly stated this

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.000
on an earlier show, but we did confirm that DDR Universe is February 27th.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.800
So almost March, but not quite.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:58.520
And I'd also like to mention Lunar Nights on the DS is coming out this week.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.520
Oh, very cool.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:03.320
Good, that was a neat title, I might have to pick that up.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.800
Coming out in Japan, we like to cover Japanese release dates too, because sometimes it's

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.680
kind of interesting to see what they get a lot later, and also what they get over there

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.240
now we may be getting over here pretty soon, and I wonder if this might be one of them

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.960
on the Xbox 360, they're getting a badly needed role playing game this week, because

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.720
you know Xbox kind of gets a lot of slack for not having a lot of choice when it comes

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.720
to role playing games.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:26.160
I mean sure you have Phantasy Star, which is kind of borderline, and then you have Enchanted

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:31.780
Arms, but they're getting a new game this week from Type, or I'm sorry from Idea Factory,

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:37.340
it's called Diario Rebirth Moon Legend, it's a new RPG coming out on the Xbox 360, coming

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:40.160
out in Japan on the 8th.

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.880
It's coming out in Japan this week on the 8th, Fusion Frenzy 2 on the Xbox 360, coming

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:50.040
out on the Playstation 3, Virtua Fighter 5 makes it's way this week on February 8th,

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:53.720
that should be pretty cool, it's also coming out with a little stick, a Virtua stick is

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.160
coming out just for that game.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:06.620
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, guess what Jamie, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai, that's

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:12.360
the subtitle for Cooking Mama on the Wii, coming out this week by Taito over there in Japan,

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:19.040
oh she's over here to correct me, my horrible pronunciations, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai,

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.040
I'm getting better, Taikai, give me that, I'm getting better, you're getting better,

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:30.520
alright and coming out on the Playstation 2, Outrun 2 is coming out, Stella Deuce, and

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:38.640
one of my favorite title names for this week coming from Capcom, Full House Kiss 2 is coming

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:45.960
out on the Playstation 2, and the cover for Full House Kiss 2, it's four guys all surrounding

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:55.320
a chick holding a bouquet, so you know what that means, they're all going to go banger.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:01.320
Coming out on other systems, the Nintendo DS has Jet Impulse and Luminous Arc and Morita

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:06.320
Shogi on the DS, all coming out this week, and lastly do we have anything on the PSP,

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:13.120
we do, New Rainbow Island, Herdy Gurdy Daibuken is coming out this week, that should be tons

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:19.100
of fun I'm sure, I know, but it's kind of like, Bubble Bobble in general, like I remember

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.720
like the retro Bubble Bobble stuff used to be cool, but ever since that whole no boss

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:27.360
on level 30 thing I just, Rainbow Island, I'm burned down on that shit, Rondo of Blood,

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.360
alright anyway.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:35.320
Okay, well, for our friends in the UK, there are some games coming out, which is a good

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:41.840
thing because games coming out, you know, is fun, we have coming out February 6th, War

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:50.120
Rock on PC, on the 8th, Sam & Max Episode 3, the Mole, the Mob, and the Meatball on PC,

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:57.160
on the 9th though, just a crap ton of games, Avatar the Last Airbender on damn near everything,

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:04.320
Battle Stations Midway, Battle Zone, Blade Dancer, Lineage of Light, Bomberman, Charlotte's

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:12.400
Web on a few things, Deep Labyrinth, Maelstrom, Magical Starsign, Metal Slug Anthology, Naruto,

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:19.560
Ultimate Ninja, Okami, scrolling down because I'm running out of room, Saint Seiya the Hades,

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:25.080
Space Empires V, The Professor's Brain Trainer, Logic, and Memory, The Sims Life Stories,

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:30.240
Thrillville, Totally Spies 2, Undercover, and that's it so far.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.000
Did you say they're getting Okami this week?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.160
Yeah, PlayStation 2.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:38.600
Now since way too many people overlooked that game over here, I'm leaving it up to you folks

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.040
over in the UK to show Okami a little love so we make sure we get a sequel out of that

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.040
game.

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.040
Sound fair?

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.040
I didn't know there was a Saint Seiya game.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.880
I don't think you're going to get a sequel since Clover Studios is gone.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.800
Oh fuck, that's right, huh?

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.920
Lots of Metal Slug, everybody.

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:55.920
Lots of Metal Slug.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.800
Okami's sequel is now sitting with my Guardian Legends sequel somewhere.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.000
Cry.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.240
Sob.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.360
Leap.

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.520
QQ.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:11.360
Anyways, one movie that doesn't really need to be made is definitely going to be spawned

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.960
from a game with lots of sequels, DOA the movie.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.160
Apparently it was going to be a theatrical movie but then apparently they realized, hey,

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.160
you know what?

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.160
The movie really sucks.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:25.000
So let's just release it straight to DVD, which means that someone dumped it to the

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
internet.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.520
Doesn't the movie have Ally Larter in it?

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.520
Who is...

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.520
Devin Alki in it.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520
Yeah.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.680
Ally Larter is the one chick on Heroes that nobody likes her storyline and everybody who

01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:37.320
TiVo's it fast-forward her scenes.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:40.120
Is she the one who plays the split personality?

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.120
Yes.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.520
I haven't even watched any and I know who that is.

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.440
I think she's in the movie, right?

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.920
The only thing I saw was a scene of her in that place.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.800
I, you know, I...

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.800
Spoilers!

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.800
I told Rob.

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.800
I know.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:58.160
It is available on Google Video and to be honest, if you really want to watch the whole

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:02.600
thing I guess it's better than spending the money to rent it or buy it.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:09.580
But really, I just hear it's just yet another really bad movie.

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.080
It won't play.

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.720
Well, I think they had originally it linked on.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.520
Don't they keep taking it down and stuff?

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.120
It keeps getting taken down, but it is.

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:24.080
It does come back up and if you read the Kotaku story which links to the structural story.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.380
It's like that Natalie Portman video when she rapped on SNL.

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:32.000
They just kept taking it off of YouTube and it kept coming right back.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.900
But here's what you can do if you really want to, you know, watch it and keep it or whatever.

01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:41.060
You can always download the PSP or iPod versions and you can download those straight to your

01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:42.060
PC.

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:46.520
If you don't want to stream it later on.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.080
Brad from Pod Culture which is another indie podcast is in our chat room right now and

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:53.560
says, LOL we just reviewed that on our latest episode.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:59.340
So if you want to hear Brad's review of Dead or Alive the movie, check out podculture.blogspot.com.

01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:04.520
This whole movie could have been made a lot better and worth watching if it were rated

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.640
NC-17 and there was more nudity.

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:13.520
Because right now as it stands there is no nudity in it so that is the main problem to

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.880
why this, because it doesn't matter if the movie sucked, as long as it had nudity it

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.240
would have been great.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.000
Whoever is playing this rondo of blood is really bad.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.640
I mean how about the, you know, how about the...

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.240
You know one of those sites taped me playing one of the game.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.880
I don't know who did it, but you know how like they do the...

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.760
Did you keep getting picked up by the dragon?

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.760
No.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760
Then this isn't you.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.760
Oh good.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.880
Because you know like sometimes they hook up their equipment like as you're playing

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:40.880
it and they're taken.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:41.880
Like that happened...

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:45.400
I know some of the Rumble Roses XX clips out there were mean because like I was sucked

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:49.440
so bad I was getting owned and like so there's some Rumble Roses XX clip out there and I'm

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.360
playing the chick who's getting killed really bad.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.360
I'm sorry.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.600
I'm sorry if I keep going back to...

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.880
I know, total tangent stuff.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.880
Anyway.

01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.840
We will beat the Dracula out of her during the break folks, so don't worry.

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.160
Oh, oh, oh.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:09.080
There is a new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan this spring.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:14.360
Sega and Toei Studios are teaming up for a feature-length adaptation.

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:22.240
It's Ryugo Goto-ku is the Yakuza name, part two is coming out.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:28.680
It's coming out from Miike and he had practiced before making cinematic versions of the game,

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.560
so should be interesting.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:37.120
He's also made Audition, Chakushin Ari, and one of Loki's favorites, Ichi the Killer.

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.320
Ichi the Killer is awesome.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:43.160
He should be very excited about this new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan because if they

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.260
tear some guy's face off and throw it against a wall, I mean, I don't see how that could

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.600
be bad like in Ichi the Killer.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.600
That was gross.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.880
I still will not watch that.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.260
You don't think they have a special edition of that out now, I think?

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:55.720
It's pretty violent.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:00.720
If they have a super violent version of the movie, I would totally watch that.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.000
I remember seeing it somewhere.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.400
Well, at any rate, you know, there's I'm sure people who are going to be a little violent

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.780
over this bit of information.

01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:19.520
A major UK retailer, HMV, their online store, is taking pre-orders for PlayStation 3s, but

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:27.480
you have to also purchase a 4GB PSP pack, so you'll be paying a total of £675.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:35.720
They're sending an email out that will say you become one of the lucky few who can pick

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:38.080
up the PlayStation 3 at launch.

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:44.240
The quote says, at HMV.co.uk, we've been working with Sony to offer up to 5,000 customers an

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.200
incredible deal when you buy the new Sony 4GB PSP.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.760
Sony takes advantage of this offer, will get priority over other HMV.co.uk customers for

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.240
the PlayStation 3.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:59.400
The deal also includes two PSP games, Kills and Liberation and Gangs of London, for the

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:04.320
price of £674.99.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.240
Are they expecting the same mass hysteria over there in the UK that they had over here

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.240
at first, which, you know, then after Christmas just kind of dropped off like a rock?

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.640
I mean, is that, because that's the kind of shit we saw them doing over here when it came

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:16.640
out.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.840
It's crazy, and then realize the Wii was better.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:23.640
Well, again, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, and, you know.

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.640
So the Wii is better.

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.840
Well, yeah, and the Wii had Zelda and all that.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.560
There's one good PlayStation 3 game out right now.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.560
One.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.400
I really hope more comes out.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:38.040
I mean, I, it's not that I want to see Sony fail, and it's not that I want to make fun

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:43.440
of Sony, and I love my PlayStation 2, but, God damn, Sony.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.560
They're making it easy for us.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:48.040
I know, it's like, God, argh!

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:52.360
We actually have not touched our PS3 in, I want to say, about two weeks now.

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:56.800
And the only reason we actually put anything in it was to watch Talladega Nights, and that

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:00.080
was Dan, and I left the room.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.320
I'm sorry I grew up in Alabama.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:07.120
Alpha Canagram says, I hadn't played Zelda in two to three weeks due to Virtual Console.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.520
You know, I forgot to say at the top of the show I've been playing Virtual Console, that's

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.520
the other stuff I've been playing this week.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:13.280
Mario Kart 64, awesome.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.680
Still stuck on R-Type.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:17.840
I've been playing Zelda, Link to the Past, as well.

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:18.840
R-Type.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:22.040
Zelda, Link to the Past, Super Contra 3.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.800
I can play that on my Nintendo.

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.800
R-Type.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.760
My name's Jamie, and I have 50,000 consoles in my house.

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.920
They're all collecting dust, too.

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.240
We actually might sell some.

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:34.240
Really?

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.240
Yeah.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.240
I'll have to find money.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.440
I want a Virtual Boy, for no good reason.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.440
Do you have a Virtual Boy?

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.440
You want to buy mine?

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.440
Five dollars.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.440
Seriously?

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.440
Five dollars right now.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.440
I don't know.

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:48.080
I'm going to get five dollars right fucking now.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.040
I might have some change in my room.

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.040
Alright, anyhow.

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.040
I'll take it for six.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.040
Ten?

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.040
Do I hear ten?

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.040
Fuck you, bitch.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.040
I'll buy ten.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.040
I put down ten.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.040
Fifteen.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.040
Do we hear fifteen?

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.040
Fuck that.

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.040
It's not worth fifteen dollars.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.040
Yay!

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.040
Ten dollars!

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.040
Guess what?

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.040
I lied.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.040
You're a bitch.

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.040
Alright, anyway.

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.040
You still love me.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.040
Maybe.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:11.640
While we all fight out how we're going to buy the console behind the scenes and play

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:16.880
OLR Bay, while we do that, we're going to take a quick break.
