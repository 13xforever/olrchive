00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:01,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:19,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:26,182
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 221 for this February the 25th of 2007.

4
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:28,983
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're here with part B of our podcast.

5
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:32,845
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you should dip back into our archives.

6
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Visit www.orangeloungeradio.com.

7
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:42,930
[SPEAKER_14]: You can hear the first half of this show where we talked about the virtual console and how Perrin Kaplan is always the introduction to the opposite sketch and much more.

8
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,971
[SPEAKER_14]: We even took some calls, which is a rarity for part A.

9
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,432
[SPEAKER_14]: So now we're going to get into part B, some more news.

10
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:55,316
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura is not here this week, but she'll be joining us for a tape segment in part B to do the mailbag, because we always welcome your emails at mailbag.orangelaunch.radio.com.

11
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:56,356
[SPEAKER_14]: It is an interactive show.

12
00:00:56,636 --> 00:00:57,617
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just about us.

13
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,578
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we're just some schmoes on the internet like you.

14
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:02,339
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to always welcome you guys to interact with the program.

15
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,381
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have our chat room, hi chat room, waiting to interact with us.

16
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:07,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Also in part B tonight, beat the host.

17
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,703
[SPEAKER_14]: So Loki's looking forward to getting beat up a little bit.

18
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:12,944
[SPEAKER_14]: If they choose me.

19
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:13,565
[SPEAKER_14]: If they choose you.

20
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:14,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways.

21
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:22,473
[SPEAKER_16]: So, apparently the rumor that Warhawk was going to be a download title is going to be true, I guess.

22
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:35,260
[SPEAKER_16]: According to 1UP's Sam Kennedy, he apparently just recently was shown by Incognito the brand new Warhawk game, and it is going to be a download title.

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:44,405
[SPEAKER_16]: And a quote from him, What Warhawk is apparently evolved into is a multiplayer-only title featuring ground-and-air combat that will be downloadable from the PlayStation Network.

24
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:45,267
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

25
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:15,961
[SPEAKER_16]: on the PlayStation Network.

26
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:19,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it, you know, is it really this title's that weak that it can't be released retail?

27
00:02:20,363 --> 00:02:23,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is it just that, you know, the PlayStation Network doesn't have anything on it?

28
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:25,585
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, or a combination of the two.

29
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Blaze doubts the truth behind this.

30
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Blaze in the chatroom says 1UP is a tool of Satan, therefore they lie.

31
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:36,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Very true, but, you know, I would take it if they're going and actually visiting the studio that...

32
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,441
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, maybe this is the case.

33
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:42,363
[SPEAKER_16]: But then again, you know, they haven't officially announced it yet, so I guess we could still call it rumor.

34
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:43,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you buy this?

35
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:44,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

36
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Downloadable?

37
00:02:45,203 --> 00:02:46,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Not at all.

38
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:46,704
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, though?

39
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:49,025
[SPEAKER_14]: I go, how much is it possibly going to be downloadable?

40
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:49,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe $25?

41
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:52,346
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it would have been $60 as a retail title.

42
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:57,927
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll have to see what the price is going to be on this, because I know one of the things that they're pushing is full downloadable games.

43
00:02:58,427 --> 00:03:03,749
[SPEAKER_16]: So if they're just going to test the waters with, you know, Warhawk, it better be good.

44
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,290
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'll wait and hear the reviews on it, you know,

45
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:10,049
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll determine whether I purchase it or not, because it's just like, you know, Q-Bert.

46
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:14,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Q-Bert's a downloadable title, and just because it's downloadable doesn't mean I'm going to buy it.

47
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:17,373
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's crap, so I'll wait.

48
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:21,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Misty in our chatroom says, aren't most game sites tools of Satan?

49
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:21,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's true.

50
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:34,481
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, that gives me a chance to work in a plug for allgames.com, where our show is rebroadcast every week, Monday nights at 5.30, and, well, unless they run long, which they usually do, and Pacific Time and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

51
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Allgames.com actually endorsed by Satan himself, actually.

52
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:39,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So check it out.

53
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:40,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Hot.

54
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's hot, really.

55
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:42,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally, whoa, yeah.

56
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:43,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

57
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you care about Warhawk and All Rise Princess?

58
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:48,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what the hell that is.

59
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:50,217
[SPEAKER_14]: They had it on PlayStation 1.

60
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:53,420
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a biplane, like old shooting type game.

61
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you're into bi.

62
00:03:56,842 --> 00:03:59,404
[SPEAKER_16]: It was done by the same people that did Twisted Metal.

63
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:03,427
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was one of those kind of air combat games, but

64
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:22,324
[SPEAKER_16]: It was one of the big things that they were showing off the 6-axis controller at E3, and I remember laughing my ass off when I saw the guy demoing it, and he barely landed this thing on the little landing pad, because the thing was practically falling off of the landing pad, because he just sucked balls at actually using this.

65
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,125
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was kind of funny.

66
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:29,709
[SPEAKER_16]: I would have loved to see him land it and the whole thing tip over and fall into the water, but alas...

67
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Some other PlayStation 3 news for you guys.

68
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:42,730
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys have been kind of QQing over the fact that there's not a lot of, and I don't mean lining up, a lot of PlayStation 3 exclusives coming out.

69
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:51,580
[SPEAKER_14]: What's interesting is that they are going to be getting some exclusives for Spider-Man 3, which I believe is a Sony picture movie, if I'm not mistaken.

70
00:04:51,981 --> 00:05:01,768
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's interesting about it is that Activision will be putting out a PlayStation 3 exclusive version of Spider-Man 3, but it's just the collector's edition that's exclusive.

71
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:09,314
[SPEAKER_14]: The game itself will still be out on other platforms, but with the collector's edition exclusive to the PlayStation 3, you get some webisodes...

72
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:11,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Special Spider-Man 3 trailers as well.

73
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,561
[SPEAKER_16]: As well as you get to play as the second Green Goblin in the game.

74
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:35,561
[SPEAKER_16]: There's going to be some missions.

75
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for ruining the next part of the story.

76
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:38,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I thought you were done.

77
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:39,243
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I was not done.

78
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:39,623
[SPEAKER_14]: You paused.

79
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:40,803
[SPEAKER_16]: You were a long pauser.

80
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:41,243
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fine.

81
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:42,964
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will say this.

82
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:45,485
[SPEAKER_14]: It also interfaces with the 6-axis controller.

83
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,466
[SPEAKER_14]: What, you don't care about Spider-Man 3, Eddie?

84
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:53,628
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but does the PlayStation 3 version exclusively suck?

85
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:55,728
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

86
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,229
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little early to judge, but...

87
00:05:58,402 --> 00:05:58,862
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not.

88
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:34,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of fucking over things, PlayStation 3 is going to be $1,000 in Australia.

89
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,542
[SPEAKER_16]: That's Australian dollars, of course.

90
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,464
[SPEAKER_16]: But that still equals up to $788 US or â‚¬599.

91
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:41,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that kind of sucks.

92
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:41,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Holy crap, mate.

93
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:43,145
[SPEAKER_16]: It's expensive.

94
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:43,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't it?

95
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:58,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently they say that it's the same price as the European PS3.

96
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:05,328
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just because the current exchange rate and the small population size of Australia, they're just going to get fucked over.

97
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Put another PlayStation 3 on the barbie.

98
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,110
[SPEAKER_14]: You hear those clicks?

99
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are all of our Australian listeners unsubscribing right there.

100
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:13,493
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what, though?

101
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:18,235
[SPEAKER_16]: The thing is, it may be more expensive, but you know what?

102
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:19,396
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to be including...

103
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:21,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Casino Royale

104
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Mel B says, PS3, Australian for Ripped Off.

105
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Like the commercials for the beer, get it?

106
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:01,114
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Ranma says, Crikes, Australia taking one up the arse.

107
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:04,577
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the worst Australian accent.

108
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:06,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I have the worst accent, period.

109
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,300
[SPEAKER_14]: You do.

110
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,324
[SPEAKER_14]: My Australia sounds like a Scottish guy and my British sounds like an Australian guy.

111
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It all just kind of sounds the same.

112
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:16,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like your t-shirt dude slash straight guy, whatever.

113
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,551
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't try very hard, do you, Rob?

114
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:20,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, I'm not on this show because I'm funny, okay?

115
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:21,652
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that.

116
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:22,812
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why I'm on this program.

117
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:23,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we don't know either.

118
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:24,852
[SPEAKER_14]: I really don't know.

119
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:29,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm on this program to give release dates to you every week from Japan.

120
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:35,255
[SPEAKER_14]: And, well, where there's being made fun of of the Australians, heck, why don't we just travel on over to Japan?

121
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:36,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's make fun of them, too.

122
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:38,856
[SPEAKER_14]: And their release dates for the upcoming week.

123
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:45,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Coming out, let's see, on March 1st for the PlayStation 3, Gundam Musou.

124
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,300
[SPEAKER_14]: God, is this the Gundam game we got here?

125
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
[SPEAKER_16]: No, Gundam Musou is even better.

126
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,721
[SPEAKER_16]: That's Mobile Suit Gundam, isn't it?

127
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:54,961
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Mobile Suit Gundam mixed with Dynasty Warriors.

128
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,622
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's a moose in it, too.

129
00:08:56,682 --> 00:09:05,143
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Dynasty Gundam, where you're fighting hundreds and hundreds of AI retarded... That's a pass, thank you.

130
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:05,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Robots.

131
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:08,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, what's coming out over on the Nintendo Wii?

132
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Densha Dego Shinkansen EX Aku Daikan 3

133
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:41,290
[SPEAKER_14]: I like this because this is the best cover I think I've ever seen.

134
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:47,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it like you have these real people and there's this guy on the cover that's making this face like, Huh?

135
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:48,752
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you want?

136
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:50,232
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, I farted.

137
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,272
[SPEAKER_14]: You looking at me, bitch?

138
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,173
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the hell type of game this is.

139
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,613
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a strategy game.

140
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:57,574
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to post the link there in chatroom for those who want to see the cover of that game.

141
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,474
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one of my favorite covers I've seen in a long time.

142
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:02,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

143
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:05,796
[SPEAKER_14]: What else do we have coming out over in Japan?

144
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:07,438
[SPEAKER_14]: on the Nintendo DS.

145
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:08,999
[SPEAKER_14]: A handful of games coming out.

146
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Robot Taisen W is coming out.

147
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:14,001
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see.

148
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, Disney Meteos is almost out.

149
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:17,442
[SPEAKER_14]: That's March 5th.

150
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:18,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Disney Meteos?

151
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:18,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's the U.S.

152
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:19,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Meteos?

153
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:20,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Never mind.

154
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,104
[SPEAKER_14]: March 5th in the U.S., sorry.

155
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:23,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Coming soon.

156
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:24,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if there's any other release dates.

157
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,245
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I got.

158
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:26,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a big week for releases in Japan.

159
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:27,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Darn.

160
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,987
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also doing Euro release dates tonight, though, because DarkSakura's not here.

161
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:32,188
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me quickly get...

162
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:37,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me geek them out getting out some release dates.

163
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:40,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

164
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:44,990
[SPEAKER_14]: The Elder Scrolls on the PSP is slated for March 1st.

165
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:48,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Also slated for March 1st, Legend of Zelda The Phantom Hourglass.

166
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:49,132
[SPEAKER_14]: That doesn't sound right.

167
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,353
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that game got hella delayed.

168
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:52,514
[SPEAKER_03]: You got hella delayed.

169
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:54,015
[SPEAKER_14]: That's interesting.

170
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:55,196
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell?

171
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:57,057
[SPEAKER_14]: These don't even sound like legitimate release dates.

172
00:10:57,077 --> 00:10:59,378
[SPEAKER_14]: They're talking about Resident Evil 5 on the Xbox 360?

173
00:10:59,438 --> 00:10:59,758
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

174
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:00,619
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

175
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,920
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's just some placeholders on this calendar here.

176
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:05,725
[SPEAKER_14]: I would believe this though, Yu-Gi-Oh!

177
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:07,986
[SPEAKER_14]: GX coming out on the second for the PSP.

178
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:08,987
[SPEAKER_14]: That certainly seems legit.

179
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:10,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Still no one cares.

180
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:12,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Sonic and the Secret Rings for the Wii also on the second.

181
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:13,831
[SPEAKER_14]: There you have it.

182
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:14,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

183
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:19,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, speaking of Resident Evil, is that on your agenda tonight?

184
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:20,977
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

185
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:23,860
[SPEAKER_03]: The Resident Evil 3 trailer came out for the movie?

186
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,121
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it definitely was not on the agenda tonight.

187
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:28,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, the trailer's out.

188
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:28,503
[SPEAKER_14]: And?

189
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:29,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So go watch it.

190
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:30,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Resident Evil Extinction.

191
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:32,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually doesn't show a lot.

192
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:35,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says Resident Evil 3 was filmed in my city.

193
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you live in Raccoon City?

194
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:08,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there a lot of raccoons?

195
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:09,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, so that's it.

196
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:11,738
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I wanted to say.

197
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:15,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get some definite for sure release dates, Loki.

198
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:18,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing's ever definite for sure.

199
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,622
[SPEAKER_14]: I shouldn't try and fill in for Jamie.

200
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:20,162
[SPEAKER_14]: I just shouldn't.

201
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:24,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, some exclusive stuff real quick, and this isn't all that great.

202
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:27,272
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's already been announced, Command & Conquer 3 for the 360.

203
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:31,794
[SPEAKER_16]: It is coming out now, though, May 9th, so that's kind of cool.

204
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:33,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely need some more real-time strategy stuff.

205
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,757
[SPEAKER_16]: This one's kind of interesting, but not too exciting.

206
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:47,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Backyard Football 08, and this is one of those franchises, it's the only kid franchise for sports games, and it is coming to the Wii and PlayStation 2.

207
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:51,270
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but that's all the way in September 27th.

208
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,813
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, definitely a budget Atari title that they keep putting out each year.

209
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:59,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryoma says Backyard Football is the best ever.

210
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:01,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, well, there you go.

211
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,575
[SPEAKER_16]: The best ever.

212
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:04,016
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll stick with that.

213
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:07,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, this week, though, we've got some good stuff coming out.

214
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:12,000
[SPEAKER_16]: On the 360, we have Bullet Witch, which is going to be pretty awesome.

215
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,002
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, if you're definitely looking for some scantily clad witches fighting demons...

216
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:18,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, perfect.

217
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:23,691
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do believe that there is a download where you can get a schoolgirl outfit for her, so that's awesome.

218
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:29,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Also on the 360, Dance Dance Revolution Universe finally making its way out, and I'm picking this up.

219
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:30,954
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't wait to try it out.

220
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:37,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, I'm not going to be able to use a dance pad, but, you know, upstairs apartment and all.

221
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Samurai Warriors 2 Empires.

222
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:41,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm buying it anyway.

223
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:42,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Listeners can deal.

224
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:46,520
[SPEAKER_14]: If I have to hear them practicing guitar or piano or whatever the hell they have down there, they're going to hear me playing DDR.

225
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:47,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Samurai Warriors 2 Empires

226
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:15,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, 07, the show's also coming out on PlayStation 2.

227
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:22,480
[SPEAKER_16]: On the Wii, we've got SSX Blur, which, you know, SSX is an awesome snowboarding game, so definitely check that out.

228
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,561
[SPEAKER_16]: PlayStation 3, you've got Formula 1 Championship Edition.

229
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:28,242
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're a racing fan, you might like that.

230
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:34,603
[SPEAKER_16]: On the PSP, Chili Con Carnage, uh, which is, I believe, Total Overdose on the PSP now.

231
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:41,665
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, 300 March to Glory, uh, PSP game based on the upcoming Frank Miller movie and comic.

232
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:42,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Um,

233
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:48,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Finally, also on the PC, we've got Jade Empire Special Edition, which looks pretty cool.

234
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:53,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, Sims 2 Seasons, expansion pack for Sims 2.

235
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:58,151
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do believe that is it.

236
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:03,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I think Luminous Plus might be coming.

237
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,476
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think that already came out.

238
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:05,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Can't remember.

239
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:06,598
[SPEAKER_16]: That's moved around so many times.

240
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,557
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it did, because DMM mentioned it when he called in earlier.

241
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:13,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but I think stores got it early, so they might have broken street on it.

242
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:14,859
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm almost positive.

243
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw it at a GameStop like two months ago.

244
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,021
[SPEAKER_14]: But as much as I love Luminous, I'm not buying it again.

245
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:20,502
[SPEAKER_14]: I have it on PSP twice.

246
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:21,042
[SPEAKER_14]: I have it on 360.

247
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:22,683
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need it again.

248
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:25,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Really, I don't.

249
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:26,064
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good game.

250
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,545
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good, but it's not, you know, freaking buy it four times good.

251
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:33,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Then, of course, you know, on Virtual Console, though, you've got, you know, what is it, Ocarina of Time coming out?

252
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:36,709
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, if you want to purchase a game...

253
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Virtually, you can go ahead and do that.

254
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because I don't already have the GameCube disc and the version.

255
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:46,163
[SPEAKER_14]: How many times have they released that game?

256
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:47,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Too many.

257
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:50,427
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

258
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:57,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, speaking of buying things, one of the places very popular for folks to buy games at is Circuit City.

259
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:03,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what's interesting about this is that Circuit City is testing a new program online and at select stores today.

260
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:07,107
[SPEAKER_14]: They are now dabbling in used game sales.

261
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:10,409
[SPEAKER_14]: So it looks like they want to start competing with places like GameStop.

262
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, this means games are usually selling about $5 cheaper than they usually do.

263
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:19,795
[SPEAKER_14]: The prices, it appears, according to reports, are about the same that you would see at a GameStop.

264
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,417
[SPEAKER_14]: But of course, Circuit City wants a piece of that.

265
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:25,799
[SPEAKER_14]: A billion dollar market, apparently, that GameStop EB Games has.

266
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,761
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a little competition for GameStop would be a healthy thing.

267
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,422
[SPEAKER_14]: So I totally support this.

268
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I have to admit, I don't usually shop at Circuit City.

269
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:35,232
[SPEAKER_14]: But maybe that's part of it.

270
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Another reason they want to do this is maybe they'd like to get their foot in the door a little more with games.

271
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So I welcome the price competition.

272
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:46,981
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think GameStop could buy Circuit City very easily like they did EB Games and whatever else they've been buying lately.

273
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:48,882
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this will be a good thing.

274
00:16:50,043 --> 00:17:00,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it is a good thing as long as they don't kind of go along the same lines of their ads and coupons policy, which means that, well, for example, there was a situation that happened.

275
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:08,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Last month, Circuit City had a flyer that ran an ad which promised to save you up to $40 when you buy your Wii with them.

276
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:13,584
[SPEAKER_16]: It says, as long as you visited the website, printed the flyer, went to the shop, they give you the discount.

277
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Later on, though, they said they'd take it all back.

278
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:24,168
[SPEAKER_16]: They said the discount actually comes with a statement, qualifying purchases excluding gaming hardware, and took the coupon off the site completely.

279
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,209
[SPEAKER_16]: But apparently people went to the store and...

280
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:30,821
[SPEAKER_16]: wanted the discount and they couldn't get it.

281
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:35,444
[SPEAKER_16]: And then of course they complained to the Better Business Bureau and so on and so forth.

282
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:43,509
[SPEAKER_16]: And the response was apparently the Better Business Bureau received a ton of responses for it.

283
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:55,136
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things they basically got from Circuit City was that they reserved the right to make changes to advertisements and coupons, etc.

284
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:55,256
[SPEAKER_16]: at

285
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever they want.

286
00:17:57,514 --> 00:18:02,817
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, where they can print out, you can have a coupon for, you know, $40 off of a system or something.

287
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:05,619
[SPEAKER_16]: They can go ahead and bait and switch.

288
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Huge comments from chat room on these two topics.

289
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Joshi16 says, Circuit City will give up, me thinks.

290
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,685
[SPEAKER_14]: ShadowCharlie says, Circuit City, they can go fuck themselves.

291
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,607
[SPEAKER_14]: DDRDollarBill says, Circuit City will fall soon.

292
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:21,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Blaze says, competition for GameStop is important because there's little competition out there.

293
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:24,506
[SPEAKER_14]: James Patrick says, GameStop killed EB Games.

294
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:25,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate them for that.

295
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:28,828
[SPEAKER_14]: HitStun says, I'm starting to really miss Funkoland.

296
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:30,649
[SPEAKER_14]: And that made a lot of people go, Funkoland!

297
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:31,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Funkoland was awesome.

298
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,330
[SPEAKER_03]: The way you say it's funny, like Funkoland.

299
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Funkland.

300
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:37,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, like it's so funky.

301
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:38,772
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot of funk to it.

302
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:39,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Funkoland.

303
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:40,393
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

304
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:40,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

305
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:45,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we have some other stuff coming up in this segment, including Beat the Host.

306
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:46,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Beat the Host.

307
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:50,253
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course we need to find a worthy competitor to play Beat the Host tonight.

308
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:57,876
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you want to guess some arcade retro classics here with us, we're going to be asking a question here very soon.

309
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:00,658
[SPEAKER_14]: But we have a couple more stories for you first.

310
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:04,900
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is this one, which I think is very interesting.

311
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently Digg is trying to trademark its name.

312
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:11,523
[SPEAKER_14]: You know Digg.com, D-I-G-G.com, they're trying to trademark their name.

313
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:16,345
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me work in a cheap plug, if you would, Orange Lingerieo is on Digg.

314
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:21,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And we used to be on the first page, but WC Radio really kicked our butt.

315
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:21,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

316
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for that, Speedy.

317
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:24,334
[SPEAKER_14]: No, just kidding.

318
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:27,534
[SPEAKER_14]: But a lot of shows are kicking our butt there on Digg, including the CorpCasts.

319
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:29,395
[SPEAKER_14]: So we need help.

320
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,136
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you would like to dig our show, head on over to Digg.com, click on Podcasts, search Warren's Lounge, you'll find us.

321
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:34,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Give us a dig.

322
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:36,416
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure somebody will post a link in chat.

323
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,337
[SPEAKER_14]: We could also use reviews on iTunes.

324
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:41,797
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll tell you what, we actually had two people post reviews last week.

325
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,858
[SPEAKER_14]: So OLR is the Festering Rash of Internet Radio.

326
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:44,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

327
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:45,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome work.

328
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,338
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Uni made a more serious review.

329
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:48,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome work, people.

330
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:49,779
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so proud of the OL Army.

331
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,559
[SPEAKER_14]: So we definitely need more DIGs and more reviews.

332
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, so you know DIG, the social networking site.

333
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:55,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, get this.

334
00:19:56,241 --> 00:20:00,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, LucasArts is trying to interfere with this trademark.

335
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:11,267
[SPEAKER_14]: They have actually put in an injunction or whatever, filed an opposition, shall we say, because they had a game in 1995 called The DIG.

336
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,368
[SPEAKER_14]: And because DIG has a gaming page...

337
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:18,293
[SPEAKER_14]: and you have this game called The Dig LucasArts says is too confusing.

338
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,314
[SPEAKER_03]: But, what?

339
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,755
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even spelled the same way or anything.

340
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:24,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.

341
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:25,698
[SPEAKER_03]: That is terrible.

342
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:26,398
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty bad.

343
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:27,659
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently it is spelled the same way.

344
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:28,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it The Dig?

345
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:28,960
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

346
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is D-I-G-G and The Dig is just like a dig.

347
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:34,584
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I forgot that The Dig even existed.

348
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:35,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Me too.

349
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:36,985
[SPEAKER_03]: How could you forget?

350
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:38,346
[SPEAKER_03]: It was such a good game.

351
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:40,227
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

352
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,128
[SPEAKER_16]: That's stupid.

353
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:42,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Stupid LucasArts.

354
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,470
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all George Lucas' fault.

355
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:50,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Because he makes crappy fixes to his Star Wars movies.

356
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:56,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, so speaking of putting the blame on others.

357
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, I have to say this.

358
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Speedy in chat says, Dig Dug should sue.

359
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:03,525
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

360
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,607
[SPEAKER_14]: If the Dig can sue, why can't Dig Dug?

361
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Why doesn't Dig Dug sue the Dig?

362
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:11,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Because when you dig stories, don't you say, dug it?

363
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it says, hey, you dug it.

364
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:13,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey man, I dug it.

365
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:15,293
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, Namco, get on that.

366
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:24,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, um, like, grave robbers and those guys should sue people too.

367
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:26,878
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

368
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:28,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that was stupid.

369
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:30,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I'm really sorry I interrupted Loki.

370
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:31,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

371
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:40,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, a Seattle, Washington, um, news station and, unfortunately, you know, they're retarded, but, um,

372
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:49,607
[SPEAKER_16]: KOMO TV, they reported on the sexual predators that are on Xbox Live.

373
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:54,391
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're blaming Xbox Live for, you know, apparently people.

374
00:21:54,751 --> 00:22:01,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember this whole story with, you know, the kid getting kidnapped and, you know, they apparently had some pictures on live or something like that.

375
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:08,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, they're documenting this 13-year-old boy playing Gears of War, which, okay, that right there is a mature-rated game.

376
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:11,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Parents obviously not paying attention to what this kid is doing.

377
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:14,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, by the way, case in point.

378
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:18,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this makes the whole story a piece of shit, right there.

379
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:23,925
[SPEAKER_14]: That they taped a 13-year-old playing Gears of War when it says clearly right there on the label, it's a mature game.

380
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:31,131
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, though, but it says, a parent is helpless to do anything, and a grown man playing the Lolia character...

381
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:33,735
[SPEAKER_16]: for Game Points.

382
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:39,256
[SPEAKER_16]: And then that basically went on to talk a little bit about... It's all sensationalism, basically.

383
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:53,399
[SPEAKER_16]: But they were also talking about how there's no way that the parents have to be online or with their kids, I guess, or something, in order for the parental blocking to work or something.

384
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:01,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Either way, it was one of those stories done by a local station for ratings that obviously had no facts whatsoever.

385
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:02,713
[SPEAKER_16]: regarding the subject.

386
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:05,776
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, everybody jumps on it like, you know, creepy.

387
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:06,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, baby.

388
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:11,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you come over here and I'll show you the size of my Xbox Live points card.

389
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:12,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

390
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:15,004
[SPEAKER_03]: That was terrible, Rob.

391
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:16,886
[SPEAKER_14]: And so is this story.

392
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:17,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

393
00:23:17,926 --> 00:23:19,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, don't yell at me.

394
00:23:19,728 --> 00:23:20,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I concur with you.

395
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:22,390
[SPEAKER_16]: This has to be... I have to laugh at this.

396
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:24,512
[SPEAKER_16]: This is also... They have a picture from...

397
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:33,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Fancy Star Universe, which it says right here, it says 500 for pics, 1,000 for nude cam show.

398
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:36,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

399
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Tattooian chat says, want to see my gamer score?

400
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, gosh.

401
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:46,604
[SPEAKER_16]: It says people are from Ohio, Kansas, and I'm from Washington.

402
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:49,525
[SPEAKER_16]: You can just talk to each other really clear.

403
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:51,606
[SPEAKER_16]: I've met other people as far away as Russia.

404
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:54,208
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it says the parents are talking about it.

405
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:55,329
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're really concerned.

406
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:58,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Our problem is parents don't see this as a threat yet.

407
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:01,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, they're not paying attention to what their kid's doing.

408
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:04,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, you've got to check out the article.

409
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:05,474
[SPEAKER_16]: It's hilarious.

410
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:13,459
[SPEAKER_16]: ComoTV.com slash news slash 5983826.html Or just probably just search on the website and you'll find it.

411
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Online Gaming World is a Forum for Sex Predators.

412
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,001
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the story article.

413
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:19,262
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's funny.

414
00:24:19,864 --> 00:24:24,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Rob, you want to come over and see my huge stiff boner?

415
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:33,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, coming from a woman, I kind of would like to see how you're going to pull that off.

416
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:39,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, $500 for pics, $1,000 for live webcam action, whatever the fuck it's in.

417
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:41,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, here's another one right here.

418
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:46,562
[SPEAKER_16]: They're talking about, apparently this kid Adam, I think this is the 13 year old that they're talking about.

419
00:24:46,582 --> 00:24:48,884
[SPEAKER_16]: His mother, Karen Epstein...

420
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:56,258
[SPEAKER_16]: She does not know about the blocking features on Xbox Live.

421
00:24:56,738 --> 00:25:04,600
[SPEAKER_16]: When she opened Adam's online account, she handed him over the setup so that he can do all the setup stuff for the account.

422
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:15,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, well apparently this parent is just stupid because she's handing over this stuff to her kid and letting him get in basically all this trouble and stuff.

423
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:19,325
[SPEAKER_16]: And to be honest, I mean, if you're really that concerned about your kid...

424
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:27,792
[SPEAKER_16]: And to be honest, I don't think she even knows that there's a threat out there with this stuff until the news person says, Did you know your kid could get raped from Xbox Live?

425
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:30,895
[SPEAKER_14]: And then she's like, Whoa, what the fuck?

426
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:38,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And related news, according to that one news story we talked about a couple months ago, PictoChat is raping children everywhere.

427
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:39,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear about this?

428
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:40,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

429
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:40,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible.

430
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:43,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start using PictoChat now.

431
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Ross Princess is horny.

432
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:48,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

433
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,631
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't rape the willing rice princess.

434
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:51,452
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true.

435
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:53,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey little boys.

436
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,635
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just kidding.

437
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:56,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Wash my brain.

438
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:57,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Never be clean.

439
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is, kids.

440
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight's question.

441
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:07,624
[SPEAKER_14]: And the first one to send this in a private message to me in the chat room gets to play Beat the Host tonight.

442
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:11,527
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to be willing to use Skype or call our 800 number to be a part of the game.

443
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:15,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, tonight's topic is classic gaming, right?

444
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:17,152
[SPEAKER_14]: So the question is,

445
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,977
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're a classic gaming expert, this should be no problem for you.

446
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:23,079
[SPEAKER_14]: On what board number does Pac-Man crash?

447
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,481
[SPEAKER_14]: That is, on what board number does Pac-Man crash?

448
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:25,961
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

449
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:30,224
[SPEAKER_14]: I posted it on the chat room, so if you know your classic games, you know what I'm talking about.

450
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:31,225
[SPEAKER_14]: So there it is.

451
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:41,413
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, meanwhile, controversial stories like our last one always generate a lot of emails, and we always get a lot of good emails to our mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

452
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,619
[SPEAKER_14]: and through the magic of the space-time continuum, DarkSakura is here tonight to read us our emails.

453
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:48,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jamie.

454
00:26:54,728 --> 00:27:00,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, this is the voice from beyond who isn't here because of family business.

455
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:08,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, here is the, uh, mailbag, and the first email comes from some guy- And thank God I'm here, too, to interrupt you.

456
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it just wouldn't be a mailbag segment if I couldn't talk too damn much.

457
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:13,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I hate your Mac.

458
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:16,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, bring your own laptop next time.

459
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:17,689
[SPEAKER_14]: B-Y-O-L.

460
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:20,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I was gonna give you a free massage, so, fight me.

461
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Massage my butt.

462
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,910
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not into the glute massage, sorry.

463
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Massage my middle finger.

464
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:26,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Right there.

465
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:27,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I massaged Christopher's.

466
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:28,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you?

467
00:27:28,851 --> 00:27:29,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

468
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:29,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

469
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:30,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to be here.

470
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:01,676
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's Obsession with Collection

471
00:28:23,698 --> 00:28:28,820
[SPEAKER_02]: and Loki's tech news, even when he gets so angry he fumbles his words, lol.

472
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,702
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't have the time and patience to sift through the nonsense to get the info I need.

473
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:34,142
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't say he unsubscribed.

474
00:28:35,043 --> 00:28:36,163
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought I said he unsubscribed.

475
00:28:36,203 --> 00:28:37,544
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but patience.

476
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:39,019
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

477
00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:57,290
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

478
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:32,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm a firm believer in family values, as in I believe in the value of... Never mind.

479
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:33,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, you're getting off topic.

480
00:29:33,782 --> 00:29:34,983
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to talk more about games.

481
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:36,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this about a video game?

482
00:29:36,744 --> 00:29:37,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Is your grandpa a video game?

483
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:38,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think he is.

484
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:39,245
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not migrant.

485
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:41,646
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, you say your piece, I'll say mine.

486
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:42,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyway.

487
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:45,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, to a degree it's gotten a little bit crazy.

488
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:49,030
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, those are like how the shows used to be back in the day.

489
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's kind of fun to let loose and be kind of silly once in a while.

490
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:53,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really...

491
00:29:55,342 --> 00:30:18,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Ratings state other than what you just said However, I like to keep it a bit more in line Finding the balance is kind of hard Sometimes you do have to let loose and be a little bit silly Everybody needs a change A little break Change is good for you Maybe you need to be silly more often

492
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:24,560
[SPEAKER_02]: You're one of those people who, it seems to me, that your energy is rooted in your root chakra, which is the first one.

493
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Jesus Christ.

494
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,381
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, look, look.

495
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,461
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say my piece.

496
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,002
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I agree with what you're saying.

497
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:37,788
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about balance, and the trick is that we have to find the right balance on this program between, you know, too crazy and too, you know, too much hardcore games.

498
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:41,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Because honestly, you know, there's like 300 video game podcasts out there.

499
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:48,515
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, granted, just because we were one of the first ones out there doesn't mean that, you know, people will automatically, you know, tune into us because we were one of the first.

500
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,782
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to compete with 300 podcasts, everything from other independent podcasts to corporate podcasts.

501
00:30:54,842 --> 00:30:57,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I don't see the other independent podcasts really as competitions.

502
00:30:57,663 --> 00:31:06,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually want to say thank you to the emailer in a strange way because the other podcast he says he's going to go listen to instead are at least both independent podcasts that are just fine shows.

503
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,047
[SPEAKER_02]: But there wasn't an instead there.

504
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:09,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, whatever.

505
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:09,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

506
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:12,769
[SPEAKER_14]: So regardless, but it's interesting because â€“

507
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:18,289
[SPEAKER_14]: For me, I know I've listened to one of those shows before, and they kind of have an off-topic-ness of their own.

508
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:19,150
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not a bad thing.

509
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,650
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you have to have a personal touch.

510
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,671
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what makes all these shows unique.

511
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:25,692
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, we're still trying to find the balance in a way.

512
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:28,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I was a little crazy the past couple weeks, but, you know, it was fun.

513
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:31,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what makes me happy about this one, though, is that he cared enough to tell us.

514
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:32,994
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

515
00:31:33,454 --> 00:31:37,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I mean, that to me just seems like is, you know, hey, I want you guys to do better, you know.

516
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:41,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, if that's the case, that's sort of the vibe I was getting.

517
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:43,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I hope that's the case.

518
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I hope you're still listening.

519
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:45,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry for picking on you.

520
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I pick on everybody out of love.

521
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,249
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, honestly, that helps us do better.

522
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:57,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you stick with us, keep giving us that chance, you know, you'll...

523
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:02,936
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

524
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:31,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be eating cake.

525
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, have fun.

526
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring me back some cake.

527
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:34,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it ice cream cake?

528
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:35,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

529
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,044
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for Grandfather.

530
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:36,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Cake the video game?

531
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:38,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Cake the band?

532
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:39,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So, next email.

533
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:40,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, next email.

534
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,551
[SPEAKER_02]: From AZHP.

535
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:42,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.

536
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:44,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

537
00:32:44,314 --> 00:32:44,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a dude.

538
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:46,387
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3 Price Drop

539
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:09,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, do you guys think this is a wise decision?

540
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Would they make more money by keeping the same price but having a cheaper cost of production?

541
00:33:13,811 --> 00:33:18,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would they benefit from having a larger install base with a price cut to get more software sales?

542
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:23,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It just feels like Sony of America doesn't even know what Sony Japan is doing or thinking.

543
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:24,755
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all just winging it.

544
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:28,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the PS2, even though I'm on my third one because they keep breaking.

545
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:33,159
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just keep doing the wrong thing at the wrong time with the PS3 and PSP.

546
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:33,959
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?

547
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,720
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

548
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:40,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather pay more for a quality product.

549
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:42,206
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my thought.

550
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:45,787
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually sort of why I like my first generation Japanese PS2.

551
00:33:46,227 --> 00:33:53,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even though they had parts that wore out a little bit faster, they were a little bit better made in terms of their sturdiness.

552
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,110
[SPEAKER_02]: It's business.

553
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,811
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always wanting to make things cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and not change the price.

554
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:04,731
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to make it transparent to the buyer.

555
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:06,672
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to know the difference.

556
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:08,114
[SPEAKER_02]: www.DarkSakura.com

557
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:36,046
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

558
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:55,060
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, granted, Sony doesn't want to keep taking such a big hit, so they do want to cut corners.

559
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:56,382
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, it's about a balance.

560
00:34:56,442 --> 00:35:06,990
[SPEAKER_14]: If they can maybe save $100 on a system, pass along $50 of that savings to me, at least it'll be the illusion of, hey, the price is falling, even though they're going to actually gain a little more money, if that makes sense.

561
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:23,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I hate to keep comparing things to my massage therapy, but it's actually a lot of what they talk about in the business aspect of that is that when you're trying to get clients in, and in this case comparing it would be new buyers, you make like an introductory price.

562
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:30,810
[SPEAKER_02]: You make like a special, you know, get your PS3 at the sale date, you know, maybe like a corporate sponsored sale.

563
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,612
[SPEAKER_02]: They get a bajillion buyers, you know what I mean.

564
00:35:33,692 --> 00:35:35,414
[SPEAKER_02]: They get more people purchasing it.

565
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:37,395
[SPEAKER_02]: and then have it be at the regular price.

566
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:39,136
[SPEAKER_02]: They can say, oh, well, this is a good product.

567
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:40,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really worthwhile for you to buy it.

568
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other people will come back.

569
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:44,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, I think, how you do it.

570
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:45,159
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

571
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,000
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you're listening, Sony.

572
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony never listens to us.

573
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:50,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Kasarai just needs a massage.

574
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:53,523
[SPEAKER_14]: He needs Jamie to touch his chakra.

575
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:54,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Not by me.

576
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:56,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

577
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:57,745
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people I... Give him a happy ending.

578
00:35:58,946 --> 00:35:59,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

579
00:35:59,486 --> 00:35:59,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart.

580
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:03,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this one comes from Twist.

581
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:03,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Twist.

582
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Twist is a new writer, too.

583
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:07,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Twist.

584
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:09,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you're awesome.

585
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:11,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, hey, OLR.

586
00:36:11,214 --> 00:36:12,575
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things I want to write about today.

587
00:36:12,675 --> 00:36:14,115
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I was at GameStop today.

588
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:14,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

589
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:17,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were two Sony men there.

590
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:18,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony, big capital letters.

591
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they were just checking on their PS3 demo setup or something.

592
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:28,460
[SPEAKER_02]: The assistant manager there, a friend of mine, was talking to one of them and asked when the US will see any white PSPs.

593
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,561
[SPEAKER_02]: The man explained it probably wouldn't happen.

594
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,862
[SPEAKER_02]: They watched Nintendo sell their multicolored systems and learned a little from it.

595
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Owning every colored system seems to be a trend in Japan and not America.

596
00:36:38,992 --> 00:36:47,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if a white PSP were to be released and someone who wanted a white PSP went to a store to buy one and they only had black ones available, they would leave the store and not buy any PSP.

597
00:36:47,558 --> 00:36:50,420
[SPEAKER_02]: They would therefore be losing out on a PSP sale.

598
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:52,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the excuses he gave.

599
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:54,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And instantly the sex stopped.

600
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:55,064
[SPEAKER_02]: She later explained...

601
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:24,328
[SPEAKER_02]: She used to hate video games.

602
00:37:24,648 --> 00:37:32,695
[SPEAKER_02]: She would get mad at her little brother all the time when they were younger and her father would chase him off the TV when he would be playing.

603
00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:34,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So why the sudden interest, I asked.

604
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:39,921
[SPEAKER_02]: She figured out that she hated them maybe because her brother never let her play and no one ever taught her.

605
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:46,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought maybe every girl is a potential gamer but can't express it because of game-hugging brothers.

606
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:49,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I used to just kick my brothers off and play myself.

607
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:53,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Last thing, Evolution Fighting Game Tournament, evo2k.com.

608
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:54,633
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys should check it out.

609
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:55,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great experience.

610
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:58,493
[SPEAKER_02]: People here take fighting games to a whole other level.

611
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:00,674
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have the Bimani community.

612
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:02,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the fighting game community, lol.

613
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:03,954
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

614
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:04,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the show.

615
00:38:04,494 --> 00:38:04,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it up.

616
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:06,855
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter how off-topic the show goes, it's always great.

617
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:12,336
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the fighting game community, they're some pretty hardcore people.

618
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:15,416
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't follow that scene a whole lot because I suck at fighting games.

619
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:18,197
[SPEAKER_14]: But, yeah, it's pretty hardcore there.

620
00:38:18,237 --> 00:38:19,837
[SPEAKER_14]: I like Smash Brothers, though, but I suck at it.

621
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:22,538
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a funny story.

622
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:28,103
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy who's well known in the cosplay community now named Chris, Chris Tang.

623
00:38:29,964 --> 00:38:41,074
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time ago when we first met him, he worked for Capcom and brought his own joystick over to our house and proceeded to be on like a level five difficulty while Dan was at like a one difficulty.

624
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:46,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan actually beat him around and he said that that was the most fun he's ever had playing because someone actually managed to beat him.

625
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:50,503
[SPEAKER_14]: So losing once in a while isn't so bad.

626
00:38:51,764 --> 00:39:02,806
[SPEAKER_02]: If you beat everybody that's around you, then... That's why I kind of... You know, I love fighting games, but there are people who get way too into it, who get too good for the game to be enjoyable, I think.

627
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Have I told my Street Fighter II chick story on this air once?

628
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:13,588
[SPEAKER_14]: One time I was in L.A., and I was on, like, a trip, and it was when I was younger, probably about 17, and we were at a comic book shop late one night.

629
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:15,968
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, like, after closing, but for some reason a bunch of people were still there.

630
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,689
[SPEAKER_14]: There were all these hardcore Street Fighter II people playing,

631
00:39:19,048 --> 00:39:23,270
[SPEAKER_14]: And I walked in, I didn't know much about the game, and I was playing Chun-Li, and I kicked all their asses.

632
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:23,790
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

633
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:29,233
[SPEAKER_14]: But the thing is, is that I probably beat like eight of them in a row, and they were getting pissed, like, who is this guy, what the hell is he doing?

634
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:35,295
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it was probably because I was doing some new, I was some new blood, and they all knew each other's techniques, probably.

635
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:36,396
[SPEAKER_14]: So they kicked my ass.

636
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, finally, you know when I went down?

637
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:43,039
[SPEAKER_14]: When some girl walked in, and she also picked Chun-Li, she schooled me.

638
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:43,879
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

639
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:46,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Julia, who on Tekken... Julia and Jin both have...

640
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:16,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Moves that block throws.

641
00:40:17,405 --> 00:40:27,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was just using them over and over again and managed to piss them off so badly that they left all of their credits in the machine and left.

642
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:29,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, of course, took advantage of it.

643
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:32,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to let any credits go to waste.

644
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:33,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

645
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:34,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I love being a girl gamer.

646
00:40:34,755 --> 00:40:36,916
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we completely got off topic of that email, but oh well.

647
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:38,097
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what happens when you email us.

648
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:41,298
[SPEAKER_02]: This one comes from Radink.

649
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:42,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's how it's pronounced.

650
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:44,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey OLR, love the show.

651
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I was curious as to what the closing song of the show was.

652
00:40:47,914 --> 00:40:50,035
[SPEAKER_14]: It is iFuturelist by Kiri Yamaoka.

653
00:40:51,136 --> 00:40:51,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

654
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Fame producer of the Silent Hill series.

655
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:55,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Uber email.

656
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:57,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is from McFloyd.

657
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,360
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great email.

658
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear OLR Crew, I haven't emailed in a while, so I thought it was about time I did.

659
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of emailing, whatever happened to the letter of the week?

660
00:41:07,944 --> 00:41:10,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it just phase out because I haven't heard one being announced for a while?

661
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:15,867
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason I think about it is because my first email was the letter of the week, and I was ecstatic about it, and I haven't heard much since then.

662
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:17,508
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

663
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:23,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been... Okay, I know this is hardly an excuse, but I have been horrendously busy.

664
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, also, just we haven't gotten a lot of Uber emails lately.

665
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours is it.

666
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:27,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

667
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:28,813
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a second-time winner.

668
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,224
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't get a lot of Uber emails.

669
00:41:31,244 --> 00:41:39,371
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the idea behind the Letter of the Week was for the Uber emails that were just too long to read on air, we would have them just be the Letter of the Week and everybody could go read them on their own time.

670
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:42,574
[SPEAKER_14]: But we haven't gotten a lot of those lately.

671
00:41:43,075 --> 00:41:43,695
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

672
00:41:44,176 --> 00:41:44,776
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's it.

673
00:41:45,897 --> 00:41:48,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the longest email we've received by default you win.

674
00:41:49,421 --> 00:41:50,462
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, it's a really good email.

675
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:51,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to finish reading it.

676
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:51,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

677
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:55,356
[SPEAKER_02]: and finding more and more that graphics really do affect what I think of a system.

678
00:41:55,797 --> 00:42:02,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my Xbox 360 because it has games like Gears of War and I'm very excited about the effects in Halo 3 from what I've been reading on the Benji website.

679
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:08,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I don't know if I'll be buying a PS3, it still really impresses me as everything looks so realistic.

680
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:27,664
[SPEAKER_02]: If Sony made some better decisions and the price went down a bit, I might even consider getting the PS3, mainly because it has the processing power to make major games perform well and possibly to make the dashboard, or whatever it's called on the PS3, very sleek, easy to navigate, and a simple place to put music, pictures, movies, etc.

681
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:33,369
[SPEAKER_02]: In a few years, I would see the PS3 and Xbox 360 as good game consoles, but I'm worried about the Wii.

682
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:41,331
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have the power to play games that will make people gasp in admiration, or the space right off the bat to store large amounts of information.

683
00:42:41,651 --> 00:42:48,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the graphics of a game generation that was supposed to last five years, and it's supposed to last for a generation that could be even longer.

684
00:42:49,078 --> 00:42:57,384
[SPEAKER_02]: The controller is innovative, there's no doubt, but games like Katamari Damacy pulled off innovation with regular PS2 controller and peripherals can always be made.

685
00:42:57,805 --> 00:43:02,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Software like the Wii channels can very easily be copied by Sony or Microsoft.

686
00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:08,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So why haven't they done it?

687
00:43:10,813 --> 00:43:13,934
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, again, it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.

688
00:43:14,314 --> 00:43:16,255
[SPEAKER_14]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

689
00:43:16,956 --> 00:43:26,840
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the Wii, you have Wii Sports, Zelda Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, and on the PlayStation 3, you have Mobile Suit Gundam, Sonic the Hedgehog.

690
00:43:27,461 --> 00:43:30,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Granted, you have Resistance, but Resistance...

691
00:43:30,643 --> 00:43:33,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Is Resistance $600 plus $60?

692
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,468
[SPEAKER_14]: No, okay, let me give PS3 benefits out.

693
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:41,932
[SPEAKER_14]: $500 plus $60 plus, you know, whatever the component cable costs to make the game look good.

694
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:42,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it worth that?

695
00:43:43,073 --> 00:43:43,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it that good?

696
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:45,114
[SPEAKER_14]: I say no.

697
00:43:46,035 --> 00:43:47,056
[SPEAKER_14]: For the average gamer, no.

698
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:54,775
[SPEAKER_14]: But whereas the Wii, you know, again, the Wii is going towards a different audience than you, the hardcore gamer.

699
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:57,856
[SPEAKER_02]: They're accomplishing their goal very beautifully, I think.

700
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I know a lot of people.

701
00:43:59,857 --> 00:44:01,898
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, look, we have Marissa in here last week.

702
00:44:02,238 --> 00:44:07,439
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had, you know, I've had other people I know that don't really play a lot of games or haven't played a lot since 8-Bit Nintendo.

703
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:08,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Grandparents are playing the Wii.

704
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you know, just even outside the grandparents, because I think a lot of the, like, you know, anti-Nintendo crowd says, like, oh,

705
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:19,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, a grandma may play Wii bowling, but does that mean she goes out and buys a Wii?

706
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:23,765
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, but that means that grandma's going to think about that for her kids.

707
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:35,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I was at Target a couple of days ago and saw this lady probably in her early 60s buying a Wii, and we were in line together.

708
00:44:36,236 --> 00:44:38,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked her, I was like, so this is for your grandkids?

709
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:39,158
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, no, it's for me.

710
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:43,201
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't want to come off sounding like a Nintendo fanboy.

711
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:43,762
[SPEAKER_14]: To be fair...

712
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:46,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Sony, you know, has the potential.

713
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:46,611
[SPEAKER_14]: You're right.

714
00:44:46,631 --> 00:44:47,151
[SPEAKER_14]: This guy's right.

715
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:49,453
[SPEAKER_14]: The system's got a lot of processing power.

716
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,154
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got a lot of potential.

717
00:44:52,034 --> 00:44:53,735
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, so does the Wii.

718
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:56,156
[SPEAKER_14]: We know Nintendo always keeps secrets about systems.

719
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,396
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't show off till later.

720
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:00,697
[SPEAKER_14]: The Wii really, truly has not gone online yet.

721
00:45:01,077 --> 00:45:03,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they will, despite the whole friend code thing.

722
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:11,241
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have this feeling that, you know, once you really sit down and play Animal Crossing with Wii Connect 24, it's going to be a different type of experience all its own.

723
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:16,623
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the meantime, I still think Microsoft will always be the king of gaming, online gaming in this case.

724
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:17,323
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't know.

725
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:17,743
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

726
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:18,024
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

727
00:45:18,064 --> 00:45:18,724
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just too early.

728
00:45:18,864 --> 00:45:19,084
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean...

729
00:45:19,577 --> 00:45:22,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Wake me up when Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII are out.

730
00:45:22,798 --> 00:45:24,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I can really assess the PlayStation 3.

731
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:29,079
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, it's a pretty box with nothing inside it.

732
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:31,520
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I feel.

733
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, mine's dusty now.

734
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if I were to show... It's a shiny, dusty collector.

735
00:45:38,181 --> 00:45:44,382
[SPEAKER_14]: If I were to show my mom Resistance, she might go, well, it's nice looking.

736
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,163
[SPEAKER_14]: But if I were to show my mom Wii Sports, she'd go...

737
00:45:47,856 --> 00:45:48,076
[SPEAKER_14]: and so on.

738
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,280
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one other issue that's been bothering me.

739
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,581
[SPEAKER_02]: The way people rate games.

740
00:46:05,621 --> 00:46:14,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it disturbing, and this doesn't just relate to video games, that sex is as much a bigger deal than violence for the ratings as it's a much worse thing.

741
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:30,793
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who really understand what violence does, I suppose it's okay that violence is so prominent in video games, but when little kids grew up seeing in movies and games that violence is not such a big deal and sex is awkward or wrong, or when people do it, they're somehow breaking the rules, it definitely sets them on the wrong path for looking at life.

742
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:35,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that as long as games and shows are separated from reality, it's okay.

743
00:46:35,952 --> 00:46:43,319
[SPEAKER_02]: But when kids are becoming saturated with these ideas coming from them from all directions, it's hard for parents to give them the right information when the media controls their kids' minds.

744
00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:53,328
[SPEAKER_02]: My point with all this is that you have to give the parents a break because entertainment, video games included, is affecting children, and there will always be friends with systems to play or TVs to watch.

745
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Even parents try their hardest to stop it.

746
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,732
[SPEAKER_02]: That would require an impossible amount of patience and strength.

747
00:46:57,992 --> 00:46:59,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can see it from that angle.

748
00:46:59,433 --> 00:46:59,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I do understand that.

749
00:46:59,993 --> 00:47:02,214
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that it's just a matter of... Actually, you phrased it beautifully.

750
00:47:02,714 --> 00:47:05,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents don't often have the courage to teach their children about life early on.

751
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:36,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that if they started off educating their children, that would avoid a lot of the problems.

752
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:41,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that if their child's going to see something that

753
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:43,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a big deal to her.

754
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:43,610
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like

755
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:10,407
[SPEAKER_02]: www.DarkSakura.com

756
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:38,974
[SPEAKER_02]: because their logic â€“ they're not fully developed.

757
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:40,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Their logic is not all there.

758
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:48,603
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say, hey, this happens, this is what goes on, they're going to be in a better position to assimilate what they're seeing.

759
00:48:49,064 --> 00:48:52,027
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very interesting you bring up that point because I kind of â€“ one other little thing.

760
00:48:52,187 --> 00:48:55,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I was maybe mishearing or misreading into this letter, but I'm also hearing that this is â€“

761
00:48:57,608 --> 00:49:03,252
[SPEAKER_14]: The society and the parents have a way bigger problem with sex and games than they do with violence and games.

762
00:49:03,512 --> 00:49:05,414
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's just American culture in general.

763
00:49:05,714 --> 00:49:07,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you're not just talking about video games there.

764
00:49:07,995 --> 00:49:09,096
[SPEAKER_14]: It is movies.

765
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,057
[SPEAKER_14]: It is TV.

766
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:13,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Sex is always looked at way harsher than violence.

767
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:23,166
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously, a movie says the F word twice and it gets rated R. But, you know, you can blow up limbs and heads and, you know, sometimes you can still get away with a PG-13.

768
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:27,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet we have this real problem with underage sex in this country.

769
00:49:27,836 --> 00:49:28,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting, hmm?

770
00:49:28,777 --> 00:49:33,401
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, you kind of apply what you're saying there, and when it's taboo, people want to do it.

771
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:41,409
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet if mom and dad talked more about them having sex in front of the kids, kids would never want to have sex, ever.

772
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:43,451
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm joking, I'm not a parent, I don't know.

773
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:50,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Just something that, more information that I've taken from my classes, one of my teachers said that, um,

774
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:53,357
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

775
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Adrenaline into your liver, which is shortening your lifespan in general.

776
00:50:20,663 --> 00:50:21,683
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not breathing properly.

777
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:27,308
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, you know, there's this whole attitude that sex is something that you don't discuss.

778
00:50:27,408 --> 00:50:30,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that you keep hidden, where it's offensive.

779
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:33,093
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm willing to discuss sex on this program anytime.

780
00:50:33,893 --> 00:50:39,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and you know, and there's some people who are, who don't need it so much.

781
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:41,940
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not gonna.

782
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:45,463
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some people I know that do need it, because, you know, oh boy.

783
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:53,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, but it is, I think, you know, it is, I think, an important part of your overall well-being.

784
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:54,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a balance that it creates.

785
00:50:54,998 --> 00:51:12,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we treat it like it's a disease, when we treat it like it's something that's disgusting, that's foul and immoral, you really take something that's very healthy for you and treat it, it's like having the cure for cancer.

786
00:51:14,028 --> 00:51:16,669
[SPEAKER_02]: and thinking that it's, and treating it illegal.

787
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:19,610
[SPEAKER_14]: All the emails have this balance theme going on tonight.

788
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I fully believe in balance.

789
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:21,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good thing.

790
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:29,653
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's just that whole, that's, you know, I hate to go off on the tangent like that, but that's my view toward how America views sex.

791
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:40,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you go to a lot of other countries where people just, you know, go around topless or, you know, where nudity is on TV and no one treats it like a big deal, look at their rate of sex crimes, you know.

792
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:42,550
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to start a trend right here.

793
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,451
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go around topless in studio right now.

794
00:51:44,492 --> 00:51:45,232
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rob?

795
00:51:46,953 --> 00:51:47,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

796
00:51:47,734 --> 00:52:00,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, you know, if you take a look at it, we have such a high rate of sex crime because I think it's because we do treat it like it's a disease.

797
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:02,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, your thoughts are always welcomed out there.

798
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:04,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry for going off on it.

799
00:52:04,827 --> 00:52:06,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's...

800
00:52:07,531 --> 00:52:16,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually something that's been sort of sitting on my head for a while because I really noticed it, you know, and video games are just another symptom of it, you know, the whole hot coffee thing is like, dude, why?

801
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,502
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got an M rating anyway, didn't it?

802
00:52:20,157 --> 00:52:20,677
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe so.

803
00:52:20,998 --> 00:52:21,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so.

804
00:52:21,718 --> 00:52:24,400
[SPEAKER_14]: But they said it should have been AO, but that's R versus NC-17.

805
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:24,840
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway.

806
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

807
00:52:25,401 --> 00:52:26,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last phrase here.

808
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:28,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, Loki got pwned.

809
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:33,966
[SPEAKER_02]: He was so confident about the Halo 3 release in spring, yet on the Bungie website, a picture had the ad campaign came out.

810
00:52:34,407 --> 00:52:36,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the bottom, Fall 2007 was written boldly and clearly.

811
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:39,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess no one's perfect, but he was still wrong.

812
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:39,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's all.

813
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:40,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

814
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:42,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen to last week, part A. I called him on it.

815
00:52:43,097 --> 00:52:43,478
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

816
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:45,799
[SPEAKER_14]: He has some good reasoning, though, so take a listen.

817
00:52:45,979 --> 00:52:46,299
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

818
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:53,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Since the Wii is 7th generation and the Xbox 360 is 2nd generation for Microsoft, the term for Wii and 360 owner should actually be Wii 69.

819
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure how that math came about, but all right.

820
00:52:58,588 --> 00:52:58,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

821
00:52:58,968 --> 00:52:59,368
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll take it.

822
00:52:59,689 --> 00:53:01,129
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one from Lee.

823
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Lee.

824
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is apparently writing us from London.

825
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:05,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, hello.

826
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:08,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Hiya, guys.

827
00:53:08,575 --> 00:53:10,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you like to sit down and have some tea and crumpets?

828
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:17,255
[SPEAKER_14]: I got an email complimenting me on the British accent, by the way, to my personal email box.

829
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:17,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

830
00:53:18,235 --> 00:53:18,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

831
00:53:18,676 --> 00:53:19,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done mine on here, have I?

832
00:53:20,336 --> 00:53:21,557
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

833
00:53:21,637 --> 00:53:24,238
[SPEAKER_14]: We're running long.

834
00:53:24,578 --> 00:53:32,802
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I really like about being from Alabama, if you look up, the southern accent is actually derived from... Balance, Jamie, balance.

835
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:33,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm going to talk about it.

836
00:53:34,102 --> 00:53:40,925
[SPEAKER_02]: The southern accent is actually derived from the West England type region of accent.

837
00:53:41,306 --> 00:53:42,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you read that on Wikipedia?

838
00:53:42,246 --> 00:53:42,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

839
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:43,944
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.

840
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:46,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually took a linguistics class.

841
00:53:46,526 --> 00:53:48,908
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can find it on Wikipedia, though.

842
00:53:49,889 --> 00:53:50,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, back to the email.

843
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:52,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Hiya, guys.

844
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to comment on your marketing strategy.

845
00:53:54,634 --> 00:53:59,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob suggested at the end of your last show that all listeners go out and let one person know about OLR.

846
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:04,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this may be an unnecessarily slow process and hamper your efforts at world media domination.

847
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:08,187
[SPEAKER_02]: If my math is correct, and it most likely isn't,

848
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:09,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Lee, Lee, Lee

849
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:38,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Lee is the new marketing manager of Orange Lounge Radio.

850
00:54:38,638 --> 00:54:39,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the way you think, Lee.

851
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:40,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome aboard, Lee.

852
00:54:40,439 --> 00:54:41,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome aboard.

853
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:43,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me a plane ticket, please.

854
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,944
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the way this man thinks.

855
00:54:46,024 --> 00:54:51,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, at the end of the show, from now on, I will be encouraging everyone to tell two people.

856
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:55,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they have to tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio, and you can all thank Lee for that.

857
00:54:57,954 --> 00:54:58,775
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the way he thinks.

858
00:54:58,835 --> 00:54:59,495
[SPEAKER_14]: That was brilliant.

859
00:55:00,696 --> 00:55:03,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Last email, which is going to segment...

860
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:05,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Play my music, Rob!

861
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:05,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning!

862
00:55:23,607 --> 00:55:27,448
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends, another listener, linked me to this site a few days ago, and I thought it was cute.

863
00:55:27,488 --> 00:55:30,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps it could be a website of the week or something of the sort.

864
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,730
[SPEAKER_02]: It at least deserves an honorable mention.

865
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:33,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Objection!

866
00:55:34,091 --> 00:55:35,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Which we have discussed on the site before.

867
00:55:35,731 --> 00:55:39,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I have seen previous user-made objections, so this is good.

868
00:55:39,873 --> 00:55:41,373
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about time we named this the site of the week.

869
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:44,494
[SPEAKER_02]: However, yeah, you're right, it's about time.

870
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:47,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's objection.mrdictionary.net.php

871
00:55:51,728 --> 00:55:55,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually have one submitted in this email.

872
00:55:56,691 --> 00:55:58,673
[SPEAKER_14]: So you actually had an objection put in the email?

873
00:55:59,133 --> 00:56:03,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and it's loading the text right now.

874
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:09,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly, DarkSakura should choose objection as the website of the week.

875
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Evidence shows that it is 99% amazing.

876
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:18,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to know what type of evidence that is, but all right.

877
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:20,099
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll take it.

878
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like one of my live demo entries too.

879
00:56:24,003 --> 00:56:27,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that'll do it for both the website of the week and for emails.

880
00:56:27,986 --> 00:56:28,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them coming, y'all.

881
00:56:29,027 --> 00:56:29,347
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

882
00:56:29,508 --> 00:56:36,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Any closing words you want to say to the listeners at home, DarkSakura, before we vanish you into what's current and live on the show right now?

883
00:56:36,874 --> 00:56:38,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say what I was playing this week.

884
00:56:39,356 --> 00:56:39,596
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

885
00:56:39,616 --> 00:56:41,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, quickly tell us about your gaming week.

886
00:56:41,118 --> 00:56:41,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I played World of Warcraft.

887
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:42,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah?

888
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:42,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

889
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:45,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to my dear best friend, Chris.

890
00:56:46,554 --> 00:56:47,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I am playing again.

891
00:56:47,734 --> 00:56:54,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have Burning Crusade yet because, well, I have to pay $300 at the end of March and $500 to buy a massage table in April, so I'm kind of broke.

892
00:56:56,378 --> 00:56:59,399
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I played my first human.

893
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a warlock, and I hate kobolds.

894
00:57:02,401 --> 00:57:03,241
[SPEAKER_14]: What server are you on?

895
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:05,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Raven... Ravencrest?

896
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, the server we all play.

897
00:57:07,163 --> 00:57:07,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait a minute.

898
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:08,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to say Ravenloft.

899
00:57:08,984 --> 00:57:10,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, Ravencrest, but you're a human.

900
00:57:10,905 --> 00:57:11,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

901
00:57:11,225 --> 00:57:11,945
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your character's name?

902
00:57:12,864 --> 00:57:13,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

903
00:57:35,256 --> 00:57:36,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

904
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:09,011
[SPEAKER_02]: and Misty has sent us 20,000 emails from her phone.

905
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:14,673
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can email like Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio on your phone?

906
00:58:14,753 --> 00:58:15,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do that too.

907
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:16,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

908
00:58:16,434 --> 00:58:17,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like this one.

909
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I miss you guys a lot.

910
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:22,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to go ahead and get a brand new computer once my tax money gets here.

911
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:23,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Misty's funny.

912
00:58:23,097 --> 00:58:25,578
[SPEAKER_14]: She sends me a lot of random AOL messages too, but it's cool.

913
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:27,999
[SPEAKER_14]: They make me chuckle.

914
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:28,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's the doctor!

915
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:33,313
[SPEAKER_14]: On that note, we better go back to the present time.

916
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:34,273
[SPEAKER_14]: So quickly, your final thought.

917
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:49,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody in the Sacramento, Roseville, Citrus Heights area, in April I will be a licensed massage therapist and my rates are $75 an hour for me to come to your house and give you the best massage ever.

918
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:54,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this the Orange San Diego video game show or the massage show?

919
00:58:54,479 --> 00:58:55,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm starting to wonder.

920
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:57,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Will you massage people while they play video games?

921
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

922
00:58:59,260 --> 00:58:59,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

923
00:59:00,024 --> 00:59:00,444
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

924
00:59:28,556 --> 00:59:29,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear about this, Eddie?

925
00:59:29,517 --> 00:59:29,837
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

926
00:59:29,877 --> 00:59:35,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you see the list that GamesRadar posted of the five game characters with one foot in the closet?

927
00:59:36,522 --> 00:59:37,843
[SPEAKER_14]: I did not, but I'd love to hear it.

928
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:38,803
[SPEAKER_14]: You might want to turn on that mic.

929
00:59:40,464 --> 00:59:41,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not, but I'd love to hear it.

930
00:59:41,805 --> 00:59:46,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't know if I want to really read the whole list, but basically it was a bit of a controversial article.

931
00:59:46,609 --> 00:59:54,994
[SPEAKER_14]: They said Kratos from God of War, Marcus Fenix from Gears of War, Frank West from Dead Rising, and Vaan from Final Fantasy XII.

932
00:59:55,255 --> 00:59:55,715
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

933
00:59:56,195 --> 00:59:57,176
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what's interesting?

934
00:59:57,518 --> 01:00:02,162
[SPEAKER_14]: What's interesting is kind of the way they went about saying it is they used a lot of gay stereotypes.

935
01:00:02,702 --> 01:00:09,607
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like, so-and-so is, you know, cross-dresses, so he must be gay, because he looks like a chick, so he must be gay.

936
01:00:10,768 --> 01:00:11,629
[SPEAKER_14]: That's stupid.

937
01:00:11,729 --> 01:00:12,249
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty dumb.

938
01:00:12,469 --> 01:00:17,193
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's interesting is it caught the radar of Gay.com, which is not a gaming site, it's a gay site.

939
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:21,496
[SPEAKER_14]: It caught the radar of Gay.com's UK edition, as well as another site, PinkNews.com.

940
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:25,903
[SPEAKER_14]: and they publicly yelled at these GamesRadar article.

941
01:00:26,383 --> 01:00:29,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Pink News said, quote, What is the point of outing characters?

942
01:00:29,766 --> 01:00:32,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this yet another bunch of childish straight boys laughing at gay people?

943
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:43,856
[SPEAKER_14]: And the author of the gay.com article was elaborating that the article had a very facetious tone to it and basically was making jokes about the LGBT community.

944
01:00:44,736 --> 01:00:51,021
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess because they pegged Frank West as being gay because he dresses up in women's clothes and children's clothes.

945
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:58,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, gamer guys are... Not the ones that listen to this show!

946
01:00:58,371 --> 01:00:59,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can see that, where they'd be kind of homophobic.

947
01:01:16,781 --> 01:01:18,142
[SPEAKER_03]: They make hot guys, too.

948
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:20,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you never played any of the Castlevania games?

949
01:01:20,883 --> 01:01:22,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell have you been?

950
01:01:22,524 --> 01:01:23,464
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that one game that came out?

951
01:01:23,524 --> 01:01:25,125
[SPEAKER_09]: God Hand?

952
01:01:25,565 --> 01:01:28,066
[SPEAKER_09]: That game is pretty ripping on gay people.

953
01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:30,047
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen this game.

954
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:31,788
[SPEAKER_09]: God Hand is for PS2.

955
01:01:32,348 --> 01:01:37,670
[SPEAKER_09]: The game looks pretty good, but it's pretty over-the-top porn for 14-year-old straight guys.

956
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:41,012
[SPEAKER_09]: You can spank, but only the female characters.

957
01:01:41,032 --> 01:01:43,333
[SPEAKER_09]: There's these really flaming gay villains.

958
01:01:44,926 --> 01:01:49,428
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole game is supposed to be a parody on Kung Fu games or whatever.

959
01:01:49,568 --> 01:01:51,689
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like Kung Fu Hustle the game.

960
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:53,010
[SPEAKER_16]: That's basically what it's supposed to be.

961
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but in every trailer they show the spank attack.

962
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,172
[SPEAKER_09]: But you could only spank the female villains.

963
01:01:59,192 --> 01:02:01,093
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't program it, so you could just spank anyone.

964
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:03,374
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know, that's pretty one-sided to me.

965
01:02:04,515 --> 01:02:04,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

966
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:08,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I read the original list that GamesRadar posted.

967
01:02:08,816 --> 01:02:09,777
[SPEAKER_14]: I just thought it was stupid.

968
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:10,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, dude.

969
01:02:10,613 --> 01:02:10,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

970
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:39,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, dude.

971
01:02:40,497 --> 01:02:41,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude.

972
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:42,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sure, dude.

973
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,561
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy from Gears of War is totally gay.

974
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:45,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you got it.

975
01:02:45,702 --> 01:02:45,963
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

976
01:02:46,003 --> 01:02:49,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because he's thinking about his buddies too much and all that.

977
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:56,593
[SPEAKER_16]: And Kratos is totally gay because he doesn't bang two chicks at the same time in two different games.

978
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:57,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

979
01:02:57,594 --> 01:02:59,335
[SPEAKER_09]: And he doesn't wipe his ass with tree bark.

980
01:02:59,455 --> 01:02:59,676
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean...

981
01:03:01,129 --> 01:03:02,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Where was Makoto on the list?

982
01:03:03,372 --> 01:03:04,493
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the reason I didn't take the list.

983
01:03:05,134 --> 01:03:11,823
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess maybe because it was about closeted game characters, whereas Makoto in Enchanted Arms was a... Where is the king of the cosmos?

984
01:03:14,474 --> 01:03:15,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Or Seymour.

985
01:03:15,714 --> 01:03:19,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Or where is King, the biggest lesbian in all of video games?

986
01:03:19,955 --> 01:03:21,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, she's totally a lesbian.

987
01:03:22,196 --> 01:03:24,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm kind of with you though, Skye.

988
01:03:24,697 --> 01:03:25,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really care.

989
01:03:25,537 --> 01:03:26,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't really care.

990
01:03:26,717 --> 01:03:32,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, whoa, you know, it's like, I just, you know, I want there to be a game where you spank guys.

991
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:35,059
[SPEAKER_14]: You like Sims-type games where you can just do whatever you want.

992
01:03:35,959 --> 01:03:36,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much.

993
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:39,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, as long as they let me do stuff to guys in the games.

994
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:41,720
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gay.

995
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Only willing ones, of course.

996
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, yeah, no, yeah, of course.

997
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:44,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, geez.

998
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:47,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on now.

999
01:03:47,307 --> 01:03:47,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

1000
01:03:47,808 --> 01:03:48,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

1001
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:49,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Gays are gay.

1002
01:03:51,773 --> 01:03:52,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, let's see.

1003
01:03:52,274 --> 01:03:55,297
[SPEAKER_14]: James Patrick says, God Hand, the main character is gay, right?

1004
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:56,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Or becomes gay.

1005
01:03:56,058 --> 01:03:57,660
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what the X-Play video seemed to suggest.

1006
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:57,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1007
01:03:58,461 --> 01:03:58,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, that's

1008
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:06,630
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of things, a lot of X-Play videos suggest gay themes for games and... Yeah, that's, that's kind of what this article struck me as.

1009
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,031
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like an X-Play review.

1010
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:11,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it's trying, like, way too hard to be funny, but I just don't laugh.

1011
01:04:13,073 --> 01:04:13,594
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it is.

1012
01:04:14,254 --> 01:04:14,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1013
01:04:15,395 --> 01:04:15,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1014
01:04:16,355 --> 01:04:16,795
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's it.

1015
01:04:16,836 --> 01:04:18,456
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have my feathers ruffled over it.

1016
01:04:18,476 --> 01:04:21,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I just kind of go, GamesRadar's wearing enough egg on their face over it.

1017
01:04:21,698 --> 01:04:22,999
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need to be all senior.

1018
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's homophobic and blah blah blah.

1019
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,460
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it wasn't.

1020
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:26,301
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just stupid.

1021
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:27,161
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a difference.

1022
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:28,862
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a difference between homophobia and stupidity.

1023
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:30,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody really cares about you guys.

1024
01:04:31,852 --> 01:04:40,375
[SPEAKER_16]: So every month it seems to be that there's a story out there about somebody killing somebody and somehow they're tying it into violent video games.

1025
01:04:40,415 --> 01:04:43,956
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was the case also with a Milwaukee murder.

1026
01:04:43,976 --> 01:04:50,058
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-year-old Nathan Moore was a murderer of Rex Baum, an alcoholic transient.

1027
01:04:50,718 --> 01:04:57,360
[SPEAKER_16]: And apparently Nathan Moore was quoted saying it was just like a violent video game.

1028
01:04:58,124 --> 01:05:00,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Killing the guy reminded him of a violent video game.

1029
01:05:00,946 --> 01:05:04,909
[SPEAKER_16]: So of course everyone went, ah, it's games to blame and stuff like that.

1030
01:05:05,249 --> 01:05:17,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the stepmom of Nathan actually was a dedicated Penny Arcade reader, and she actually wrote him a letter regarding the whole thing.

1031
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:27,144
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's actually quite interesting because they talk about how the kid is just kind of just crazy, getting in trouble in every which way, and

1032
01:05:27,771 --> 01:05:34,615
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it doesn't... She basically points out it's not the game... Not video game's fault, and it did not make him who he was.

1033
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:44,201
[SPEAKER_16]: He was already fucked up to begin with, so... I do think it's kind of interesting that at least there's someone out there that's willing to say, Hey, this is not the case.

1034
01:05:45,882 --> 01:05:51,145
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe someone pointed out... I can't remember where it was, but they pointed out that, you know...

1035
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:54,052
[SPEAKER_16]: He may be crazy, but he's not stupid.

1036
01:05:54,132 --> 01:06:02,839
[SPEAKER_16]: He knows that he can get some sort of crazy insanity plea with saying that, oh, video games made me do it type of thing.

1037
01:06:02,939 --> 01:06:07,623
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think he's just trying to use that to get off a little bit.

1038
01:06:08,824 --> 01:06:09,564
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1039
01:06:09,584 --> 01:06:10,004
[SPEAKER_16]: To get off?

1040
01:06:10,085 --> 01:06:10,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Ew.

1041
01:06:10,965 --> 01:06:12,687
[SPEAKER_16]: To get off from being you.

1042
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:15,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I love we can always count on the serious perspective from Rice Princess.

1043
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:16,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have any serious thoughts on this?

1044
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:17,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1045
01:06:20,433 --> 01:06:20,813
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.

1046
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:23,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I farted.

1047
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:26,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody say goodbye to Rice Princess, folks.

1048
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:27,954
[SPEAKER_14]: She won't be back last week.

1049
01:06:27,974 --> 01:06:29,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut your face.

1050
01:06:29,835 --> 01:06:30,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody have any comments on that?

1051
01:06:32,037 --> 01:06:32,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1052
01:06:34,919 --> 01:06:36,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving right along then.

1053
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,521
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are assholes.

1054
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:45,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft has been caught in a lawsuit and a federal jury ordered Microsoft to pay $1.5 billion dollars

1055
01:06:46,105 --> 01:06:55,954
[SPEAKER_14]: to the telecom group Alcatel Lucent for violating two patents related to digital music.

1056
01:06:55,994 --> 01:07:00,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, it all has to do with MP3 encoding and decoding, and that has to do with Windows Media Player.

1057
01:07:00,758 --> 01:07:02,899
[SPEAKER_14]: You might be going, what the hell does this have to do with gaming?

1058
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:14,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's because a part of this suit has to do with speech coding and video coding used in the Xbox 360, which makes you go, hmm, will future Microsoft's products be hampered by this?

1059
01:07:14,693 --> 01:07:19,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is this just a case of a jury wanting to get back at Microsoft because they're evil or whatever it is?

1060
01:07:19,654 --> 01:07:21,075
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that they're just going to pay this.

1061
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:30,117
[SPEAKER_16]: And unlike Sony, they're actually going to pay for the rights or whatever that they may have infringed on and just license them.

1062
01:07:31,198 --> 01:07:33,458
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they do that actually for the Rumble technology.

1063
01:07:33,498 --> 01:07:35,979
[SPEAKER_16]: They license the Rumbling patents or whatever.

1064
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Although some companies decide to remove them altogether because they don't want to shell out money.

1065
01:07:43,061 --> 01:07:43,501
[SPEAKER_16]: But whatever.

1066
01:07:44,682 --> 01:08:03,490
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, you know, on a completely different topic though, um, you gotta love the Russians, and they came up with this wonderful, you know, and this is like such a horrible stereotype, but, um, they've come up with a Russian, a massively multiplayer online drinking game.

1067
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that's awesome!

1068
01:08:06,151 --> 01:08:07,852
[SPEAKER_16]: And apparently it's, um,

1069
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:14,116
[SPEAKER_16]: You would take this special shot glass that would plug into your computer via USB.

1070
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:21,002
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you logged into a special chat room, the glass keeps track of how much alcohol you have left, just to make sure that you're keeping up.

1071
01:08:25,085 --> 01:08:28,648
[SPEAKER_14]: What if I put water in it?

1072
01:08:28,848 --> 01:08:29,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Ha!

1073
01:08:29,369 --> 01:08:30,389
[SPEAKER_16]: I fooled the computer!

1074
01:08:31,711 --> 01:08:33,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, aren't you Elite Hacker?

1075
01:08:34,933 --> 01:08:36,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I hacksword your shot glass.

1076
01:08:37,295 --> 01:08:37,996
[SPEAKER_03]: With water...

1077
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:41,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Or can't you just, like, pour it out into another cup?

1078
01:08:41,536 --> 01:08:45,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, like, there's tons of different ways you could hack into it.

1079
01:08:45,137 --> 01:08:46,977
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll give it all to Irene, because she's poor and can't afford it.

1080
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:47,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll take it.

1081
01:08:47,358 --> 01:08:50,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, couldn't you just go on one of those adult sites and put up a picture of somebody else?

1082
01:08:50,999 --> 01:08:59,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's about the same thing as... Or can't you just, like, drink at home, like, with your friends, and not have to do it on the computer with a bunch of people you don't know?

1083
01:08:59,621 --> 01:09:01,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, that's pretty sad.

1084
01:09:01,602 --> 01:09:06,163
[SPEAKER_16]: This sounds, to be honest, this sounds like something that they would have in, like, Second Life.

1085
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:11,853
[SPEAKER_14]: KaneVM says, in our chatroom again, chat.orangealternative.com, KaneVM says, MMO drinking?

1086
01:09:11,893 --> 01:09:12,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell yeah!

1087
01:09:12,914 --> 01:09:14,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Blackboy says, that game sounds awesome.

1088
01:09:15,436 --> 01:09:17,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Blaze says, innocent people will die over this game.

1089
01:09:17,758 --> 01:09:20,660
[SPEAKER_14]: And GS68 says, you'll die of water intoxication.

1090
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,261
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true, I do live in Sacramento.

1091
01:09:23,142 --> 01:09:25,203
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently people like to do that here.

1092
01:09:25,644 --> 01:09:26,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh god.

1093
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:27,877
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1094
01:09:27,937 --> 01:09:28,578
[SPEAKER_13]: It's true!

1095
01:09:28,678 --> 01:09:29,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give me the too soon.

1096
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:29,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Too soon, too soon.

1097
01:09:29,919 --> 01:09:30,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give me that.

1098
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:38,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, you know all those people that made those comments were like, under 21, and like, oh my god, it's so cool, a drinking game.

1099
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:48,839
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think Black Boy, when Black Boy participates in, I know they call it Free Play Friday, but I call it Drunken Orgy over at All Games on Fridays, so I think he's over 21.

1100
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:50,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, they have Drunken Orgies?

1101
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,581
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to pick up the slack here.

1102
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:54,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Mississippi Orgies.

1103
01:09:54,701 --> 01:09:55,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1104
01:09:55,882 --> 01:09:58,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it is the end of February sweeps.

1105
01:09:58,224 --> 01:10:00,406
[SPEAKER_14]: How are we going to top that on the All Games Network?

1106
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,888
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to murder someone live on air.

1107
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:03,688
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

1108
01:10:03,728 --> 01:10:04,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye, Rob.

1109
01:10:04,509 --> 01:10:06,290
[SPEAKER_14]: And you wondered why LankyStyle came back.

1110
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:10,514
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, LankyStyle, just put this plastic bag on your head, and I've got a rubber band.

1111
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:12,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Too soon, too soon.

1112
01:10:12,215 --> 01:10:12,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

1113
01:10:13,136 --> 01:10:14,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearts to you.

1114
01:10:14,317 --> 01:10:16,798
[SPEAKER_14]: He's really acknowledging me.

1115
01:10:17,139 --> 01:10:18,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how we can pull through the sweeps.

1116
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, our ratings are number one.

1117
01:10:25,685 --> 01:10:27,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, let's go back.

1118
01:10:27,906 --> 01:10:31,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well no, I know exactly how we can pull through for sweeps.

1119
01:10:32,489 --> 01:10:33,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you okay, LankyStyle?

1120
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,210
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't mean it.

1121
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,472
[SPEAKER_03]: What, an apology to LankyStyle?

1122
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:36,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1123
01:10:36,992 --> 01:10:38,693
[SPEAKER_14]: He's giving me pouting face.

1124
01:10:38,753 --> 01:10:40,894
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like unsubscribe, unsubscribe right there.

1125
01:10:41,035 --> 01:10:41,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1126
01:10:42,435 --> 01:10:42,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

1127
01:10:42,796 --> 01:10:43,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't misrepresent me.

1128
01:10:44,137 --> 01:10:44,417
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1129
01:10:45,057 --> 01:10:45,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I said don't misrepresent me.

1130
01:10:45,978 --> 01:10:47,319
[SPEAKER_14]: At least I finally got you to talk.

1131
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:47,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck.

1132
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:48,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1133
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:49,820
[SPEAKER_14]: You're mean now, Rob.

1134
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:50,841
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I'm a jerk.

1135
01:10:50,881 --> 01:10:51,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1136
01:10:52,262 --> 01:10:52,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1137
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:55,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, I'm looking at chat room.

1138
01:10:55,941 --> 01:10:59,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Blackboy says, did anyone see the photo of me teabagging stalker Oscar?

1139
01:10:59,664 --> 01:11:01,285
[SPEAKER_14]: See, look, we're going to lose sweeps, you guys.

1140
01:11:01,305 --> 01:11:02,206
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to fucking lose.

1141
01:11:02,746 --> 01:11:03,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, man.

1142
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:03,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Against this.

1143
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:05,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on, teabagging?

1144
01:11:05,308 --> 01:11:08,690
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it, I'm going to have to go and teabag Rice Princess right now.

1145
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:10,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the hell away from me.

1146
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:11,332
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really walking towards me.

1147
01:11:11,352 --> 01:11:14,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Bend over.

1148
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:14,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah!

1149
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:15,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah!

1150
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:15,556
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1151
01:11:15,616 --> 01:11:16,536
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do I owe you?

1152
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:19,959
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, anyway, we've got to go to our next segment, which is a great sweeps trick.

1153
01:11:19,999 --> 01:11:22,881
[SPEAKER_14]: It's playing a good old-fashioned game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1154
01:11:23,206 --> 01:11:31,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have a game called Beat the Host And we asked a qualifier question earlier in chat And that was, which board does Pac-Man crash on?

1155
01:11:31,728 --> 01:11:34,989
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have our winner on the line Hi, you're on Orange House Radio, you there?

1156
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:36,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, how's it going?

1157
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, who is this?

1158
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:40,551
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the Rob D Rob D, what board does Pac-Man crash on?

1159
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:50,614
[SPEAKER_14]: 256 That's right, the 256 board is when half of it glitches But apparently, you can actually still get past it But you have to be superhuman

1160
01:11:51,394 --> 01:12:00,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, if you memorize everything, it supposedly is possible, and there is a way to hack the ROM and get around that and make it normal, I think, but I don't know.

1161
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:02,843
[SPEAKER_08]: That's according to Wikipedia, so I don't know too much about it.

1162
01:12:02,923 --> 01:12:03,503
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, good job.

1163
01:12:03,523 --> 01:12:04,905
[SPEAKER_14]: You and I got the answer from the same place.

1164
01:12:04,965 --> 01:12:05,285
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1165
01:12:06,105 --> 01:12:07,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have a question to ask you before we get into this.

1166
01:12:08,027 --> 01:12:08,567
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, why not?

1167
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:10,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you dodging us and hold them?

1168
01:12:12,056 --> 01:12:14,358
[SPEAKER_14]: I was out Saturday night.

1169
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:14,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1170
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:15,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to dodge you guys.

1171
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:19,583
[SPEAKER_14]: But Saturday night is a busy night, especially when I work during the week.

1172
01:12:19,663 --> 01:12:21,124
[SPEAKER_14]: I will definitely join you guys, though.

1173
01:12:21,445 --> 01:12:24,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear that All Games is expanding to do tournaments throughout the week.

1174
01:12:24,627 --> 01:12:26,329
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will definitely join.

1175
01:12:26,369 --> 01:12:27,910
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will join on a Saturday.

1176
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:28,431
[SPEAKER_14]: I promise.

1177
01:12:28,491 --> 01:12:31,813
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do Rocky every other Saturday, and that keeps me kind of busy.

1178
01:12:32,054 --> 01:12:33,215
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1179
01:12:33,235 --> 01:12:33,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

1180
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I just forgot to give you a little grief for that.

1181
01:12:35,036 --> 01:12:35,376
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1182
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:38,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the public humiliation in front of thousands.

1183
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:38,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean 20.

1184
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:39,160
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem.

1185
01:12:40,217 --> 01:12:41,698
[SPEAKER_14]: The Humiliation in front of 20 listeners.

1186
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:42,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1187
01:12:43,078 --> 01:12:44,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Rob D, you ready to play Beat the Host?

1188
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:45,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.

1189
01:12:45,759 --> 01:12:47,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, then we need some cheesy theme music.

1190
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:52,761
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fuck is this?

1191
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:57,602
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, it's time to play Beat the Host!

1192
01:12:57,682 --> 01:12:58,603
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding, I'm not gonna do that.

1193
01:12:58,883 --> 01:13:03,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, the way Beat the Host works is you're gonna choose somebody here in studio to challenge.

1194
01:13:03,944 --> 01:13:07,125
[SPEAKER_14]: You can challenge Casper the Gay, also known as Big Gay Eddie.

1195
01:13:07,525 --> 01:13:08,426
[SPEAKER_14]: You can challenge Big Gay Eddie.

1196
01:13:08,626 --> 01:13:09,686
[SPEAKER_14]: You can challenge Loki...

1197
01:13:10,509 --> 01:13:14,030
[SPEAKER_14]: You can challenge Rice Princess or Lanky Style.

1198
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:17,131
[SPEAKER_14]: And tonight's topic is classic video games.

1199
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:19,832
[SPEAKER_14]: We have changed up the rules a little bit, but I'll explain that as we move on.

1200
01:13:20,072 --> 01:13:21,932
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, Rob D., who are you going to challenge?

1201
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:23,033
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1202
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:23,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll press my luck a little bit.

1203
01:13:23,993 --> 01:13:24,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go with Loki.

1204
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:26,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki!

1205
01:13:26,253 --> 01:13:27,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki's being challenging.

1206
01:13:27,514 --> 01:13:27,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Surprise.

1207
01:13:28,394 --> 01:13:29,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone picks Loki.

1208
01:13:29,234 --> 01:13:29,694
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1209
01:13:30,755 --> 01:13:31,975
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like the center square.

1210
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:34,216
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the Whoopi Goldberg of our program.

1211
01:13:34,716 --> 01:13:35,016
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1212
01:13:35,546 --> 01:13:36,367
[SPEAKER_14]: 10 Classic Arcade Games

1213
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:59,781
[SPEAKER_14]: What we're going to do is you're going to have two minutes to guess the ten games.

1214
01:14:00,181 --> 01:14:04,924
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will continue to play the music until you correctly guess the song.

1215
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:06,245
[SPEAKER_14]: This goes for you as well, Loki.

1216
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:11,148
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll continue to play the music until you correctly guess the song, at which point I'll go to the next song.

1217
01:14:11,428 --> 01:14:15,091
[SPEAKER_14]: However, you can always skip ahead to the next song by just saying, pass.

1218
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:16,311
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to go to the next song.

1219
01:14:16,572 --> 01:14:19,694
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have two minutes to knock all ten of them out.

1220
01:14:19,714 --> 01:14:20,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds good.

1221
01:14:20,974 --> 01:14:23,636
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you beat Loki, you win a fabulous prize.

1222
01:14:23,656 --> 01:14:24,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you on MySpace, Rob D.?

1223
01:14:25,886 --> 01:14:26,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I am.

1224
01:14:26,507 --> 01:14:30,871
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, then, Rob D., by winning tonight, you'll earn a space in our MySpace Top Friends.

1225
01:14:30,891 --> 01:14:35,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, are we supposed to do this like the old one where we just shout out the answers, or do we want to write them down?

1226
01:14:35,535 --> 01:14:38,437
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this time it's not like the way we used to do it where we have to say it all at the end.

1227
01:14:38,457 --> 01:14:39,778
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to say it while it's going on.

1228
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:41,240
[SPEAKER_14]: And tonight is a killer.

1229
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,642
[SPEAKER_14]: You're probably going to run through a bunch of games until you get it right.

1230
01:14:43,962 --> 01:14:47,425
[SPEAKER_14]: But if I don't say anything, then you haven't guessed it right yet.

1231
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:47,986
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1232
01:14:48,326 --> 01:14:51,789
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Loki is now going to leave the studio and head to our isolation booth.

1233
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody keep an eye on him and make sure he's not cheating.

1234
01:14:54,776 --> 01:14:55,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Isolation booth.

1235
01:14:55,816 --> 01:14:56,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an isolation booth.

1236
01:14:56,856 --> 01:14:57,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Like the old game shows.

1237
01:14:59,517 --> 01:15:07,139
[SPEAKER_08]: So out of curiosity, is the Orange Lounge Radio MySpace friend list easier or harder to get onto than Scott Rubin's friends list on Xbox Live?

1238
01:15:07,559 --> 01:15:12,181
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually a little harder because I finally got onto Scott Rubin's friends list on Xbox Live.

1239
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:15,542
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm almost kicked out of Orange Lounge's top 20.

1240
01:15:18,082 --> 01:15:19,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody want to talk shit about Loki while he's not here?

1241
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Rob D, you ready to start?

1242
01:15:25,485 --> 01:15:25,905
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it.

1243
01:15:26,185 --> 01:15:27,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, then here we go.

1244
01:15:27,145 --> 01:15:29,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Your two minutes begins now.

1245
01:15:33,427 --> 01:15:34,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Pass.

1246
01:15:34,827 --> 01:15:35,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Pass.

1247
01:15:38,088 --> 01:15:48,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say Missile Commander, Defender.

1248
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:49,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Defender.

1249
01:15:49,171 --> 01:15:49,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Defender.

1250
01:15:49,651 --> 01:15:49,951
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

1251
01:15:49,971 --> 01:15:50,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Defender.

1252
01:15:51,471 --> 01:15:52,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Defender.

1253
01:15:52,352 --> 01:16:01,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say R-Type.

1254
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:01,639
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1255
01:16:01,799 --> 01:16:03,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to skip this one.

1256
01:16:04,181 --> 01:16:04,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Pass.

1257
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:05,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, BurgerTime?

1258
01:16:05,362 --> 01:16:06,222
Yes, correct.

1259
01:16:06,242 --> 01:16:06,903
One.

1260
01:16:28,129 --> 01:16:28,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Tapper?

1261
01:16:29,009 --> 01:16:29,250
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1262
01:16:31,992 --> 01:16:32,572
[SPEAKER_14]: One minute left.

1263
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:33,273
[SPEAKER_08]: No idea.

1264
01:16:33,293 --> 01:16:34,454
[SPEAKER_14]: You gonna pass?

1265
01:16:34,754 --> 01:16:35,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1266
01:16:36,736 --> 01:16:41,139
[SPEAKER_17]: That's Frogger.

1267
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:41,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, correct.

1268
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:57,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Pass.

1269
01:16:57,433 --> 01:16:57,553
[SPEAKER_17]: Pass.

1270
01:16:57,573 --> 01:16:58,294
[SPEAKER_17]: 30 seconds left.

1271
01:16:58,314 --> 01:16:59,415
[SPEAKER_17]: 20 seconds.

1272
01:16:59,475 --> 01:17:02,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know this one, but I forget what it is, so I'm going to pass on that.

1273
01:17:02,257 --> 01:17:02,517
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1274
01:17:02,537 --> 01:17:02,877
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 seconds.

1275
01:17:26,577 --> 01:17:26,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Astro's?

1276
01:17:27,257 --> 01:17:31,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Five, no, four, three, two, one.

1277
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Time's up!

1278
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, I suck.

1279
01:17:34,661 --> 01:17:36,721
[SPEAKER_14]: That was hard, you didn't even get to the last one.

1280
01:17:36,781 --> 01:17:38,042
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a tough category tonight.

1281
01:17:38,462 --> 01:17:42,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Our chat room's even struggling tonight, but you did get two right, and that may be enough to beat Loki.

1282
01:17:42,404 --> 01:17:42,864
[SPEAKER_14]: So we shall see.

1283
01:17:42,944 --> 01:17:47,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, my classic arcade game knowledge is a little bit limited on that one, fortunately.

1284
01:17:49,007 --> 01:17:49,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck, Loki.

1285
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:50,640
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, here we go.

1286
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:51,961
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to bring Loki back in studio.

1287
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,462
[SPEAKER_14]: If LankyStyle would please go grab Loki.

1288
01:17:53,642 --> 01:17:54,603
[SPEAKER_14]: How is LankyStyle doing?

1289
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,024
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually got a few of them, yeah.

1290
01:17:57,304 --> 01:17:59,026
[SPEAKER_03]: He would have been a very formidable opponent.

1291
01:17:59,106 --> 01:18:00,647
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, it's a good thing Rob D didn't pick him.

1292
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:02,688
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad he picked a total loser like Loki.

1293
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Loki, how you doing?

1294
01:18:04,489 --> 01:18:04,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome back.

1295
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:09,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki's wearing the wedding shirt that Jamie and I got him, the one that says Game Over.

1296
01:18:09,572 --> 01:18:09,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1297
01:18:10,012 --> 01:18:10,292
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1298
01:18:10,312 --> 01:18:13,715
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, I can't tell you what Rob D got just yet, but we'll see.

1299
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:14,415
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a tough category.

1300
01:18:14,635 --> 01:18:15,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, I need you to look that way.

1301
01:18:16,216 --> 01:18:17,577
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, and you're going to name off.

1302
01:18:18,164 --> 01:18:19,584
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want them to see what songs are on screen.

1303
01:18:19,604 --> 01:18:20,104
[SPEAKER_14]: So here we go.

1304
01:18:20,444 --> 01:18:22,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, just say pass if you want to pass.

1305
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:25,545
[SPEAKER_14]: You have two minutes, and your two minutes starts right now.

1306
01:18:26,546 --> 01:18:26,726
Yes.

1307
01:18:26,746 --> 01:18:27,106
Pass.

1308
01:18:27,126 --> 01:18:27,306
Pass.

1309
01:18:49,148 --> 01:18:49,869
[SPEAKER_16]: DigDug?

1310
01:18:49,909 --> 01:18:50,029
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1311
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:50,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Dew?

1312
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:50,850
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1313
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:51,410
[SPEAKER_16]: BurgerTime?

1314
01:18:51,451 --> 01:18:51,611
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1315
01:18:51,631 --> 01:18:51,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Pass.

1316
01:18:52,231 --> 01:18:52,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Pass.

1317
01:19:19,529 --> 01:19:20,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Contra?

1318
01:19:20,309 --> 01:19:20,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Nope.

1319
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:21,550
[SPEAKER_16]: One minute.

1320
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:21,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Pass.

1321
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:22,550
[SPEAKER_16]: TikTok.

1322
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:22,691
Yes.

1323
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:22,931
Pass.

1324
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:44,730
[SPEAKER_14]: 45 seconds.

1325
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:45,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Pass.

1326
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:50,492
[SPEAKER_12]: 30 seconds.

1327
01:19:51,893 --> 01:19:52,373
Pass.

1328
01:19:53,113 --> 01:19:55,474
We're back to when you passed the first time.

1329
01:19:55,514 --> 01:19:55,474
1942.

1330
01:19:55,574 --> 01:19:55,914
No.

1331
01:19:55,934 --> 01:19:56,314
Minecraft.

1332
01:19:56,455 --> 01:19:56,595
No.

1333
01:20:14,532 --> 01:20:29,492
[SPEAKER_14]: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, all done.

1334
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:30,573
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's add it up.

1335
01:20:30,614 --> 01:20:31,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see how you guys did.

1336
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:37,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, actually I should say Rob D got two right, but Loki got three right.

1337
01:20:37,107 --> 01:20:37,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you win.

1338
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:41,549
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, in a lot of them I recognized, I was like, I couldn't place them.

1339
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:42,730
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really hard tonight.

1340
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Charm was doing very well, though.

1341
01:20:44,031 --> 01:20:45,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob D, I'm so sorry you didn't win.

1342
01:20:46,312 --> 01:20:46,932
[SPEAKER_08]: That happens.

1343
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:47,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, Loki.

1344
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:48,072
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1345
01:20:48,112 --> 01:20:49,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Better luck next time, though.

1346
01:20:49,133 --> 01:20:50,353
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to hear the right answers, though?

1347
01:20:50,373 --> 01:20:51,014
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet you want to know them.

1348
01:20:51,034 --> 01:20:52,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.

1349
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:53,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, damn it.

1350
01:20:53,235 --> 01:20:54,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we allowed to guess them?

1351
01:20:54,315 --> 01:20:55,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Tempest and Bubble Bobble in there?

1352
01:20:56,562 --> 01:20:57,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, they both were.

1353
01:20:57,543 --> 01:20:59,224
[SPEAKER_14]: What were you thinking, Rice Princess?

1354
01:20:59,584 --> 01:21:01,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we allowed to guess them as you go on?

1355
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:01,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, why not?

1356
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:02,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so just play them.

1357
01:21:02,685 --> 01:21:04,166
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't cheat, though, because the names are up on the screen.

1358
01:21:04,186 --> 01:21:05,007
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can't even see from here.

1359
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:05,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, good.

1360
01:21:05,367 --> 01:21:05,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

1361
01:21:06,447 --> 01:21:07,628
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think, Rice Princess?

1362
01:21:07,648 --> 01:21:08,288
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Bubble Bobble.

1363
01:21:08,308 --> 01:21:09,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki guessed that one.

1364
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:10,229
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think this one is?

1365
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:12,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Robotron?

1366
01:21:12,991 --> 01:21:13,271
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1367
01:21:14,011 --> 01:21:14,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

1368
01:21:15,352 --> 01:21:16,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no fucking clue.

1369
01:21:16,532 --> 01:21:16,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Tempest.

1370
01:21:17,013 --> 01:21:18,413
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one.

1371
01:21:18,493 --> 01:21:18,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

1372
01:21:18,853 --> 01:21:19,134
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1373
01:21:19,154 --> 01:21:20,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody got this.

1374
01:21:20,114 --> 01:21:20,995
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Burger Time.

1375
01:21:21,355 --> 01:21:23,256
[SPEAKER_14]: We both got that, actually.

1376
01:21:26,578 --> 01:21:29,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've got no clue.

1377
01:21:30,301 --> 01:21:30,701
[SPEAKER_14]: No idea?

1378
01:21:31,121 --> 01:21:31,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1379
01:21:31,882 --> 01:21:35,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Even, I think if I let it go in here a little bit more, it's the... Hold on.

1380
01:21:36,105 --> 01:21:39,067
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's right here.

1381
01:21:39,567 --> 01:21:40,267
[SPEAKER_14]: You might recognize this.

1382
01:21:43,349 --> 01:21:43,750
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that?

1383
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:44,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Crystal Castles!

1384
01:21:45,511 --> 01:21:47,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Crystal Castles.

1385
01:21:47,912 --> 01:21:48,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

1386
01:21:48,193 --> 01:21:49,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, this looks stronger.

1387
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:50,074
[SPEAKER_14]: That's stronger.

1388
01:21:51,935 --> 01:21:53,116
[SPEAKER_14]: This one's a real toughie.

1389
01:21:53,156 --> 01:21:54,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anyone got this right.

1390
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:56,779
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a tough one.

1391
01:21:56,799 --> 01:21:57,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I think somebody in studio said it though.

1392
01:21:57,939 --> 01:21:58,560
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be Zaxxon.

1393
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Zaxxon.

1394
01:21:59,280 --> 01:21:59,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, damn it!

1395
01:21:59,841 --> 01:21:59,981
Zaxxon.

1396
01:22:00,001 --> 01:22:00,321
Good job.

1397
01:22:00,341 --> 01:22:01,602
This one's one of my favorites.

1398
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,691
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give you a hint because it involves penguins.

1399
01:22:28,631 --> 01:22:29,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Sega made.

1400
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:33,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Push cubes around and swoosh little blobs.

1401
01:22:35,072 --> 01:22:35,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Pango.

1402
01:22:36,013 --> 01:22:36,893
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Pango.

1403
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:38,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, this one is the killer.

1404
01:22:39,193 --> 01:22:40,374
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anyone got this one.

1405
01:22:40,394 --> 01:22:46,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't watching chat.

1406
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:47,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Namco made.

1407
01:22:49,156 --> 01:22:50,836
[SPEAKER_14]: In most of their collections of games.

1408
01:22:51,876 --> 01:22:53,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Knights of the Round?

1409
01:22:54,077 --> 01:22:54,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

1410
01:22:54,821 --> 01:23:02,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Sword Game, incredibly slow-moving character, The Tower of Druaga.

1411
01:23:02,206 --> 01:23:04,267
[SPEAKER_14]: The Tower of Druaga was the last one.

1412
01:23:04,287 --> 01:23:04,988
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I'm like, what?

1413
01:23:05,028 --> 01:23:05,969
[SPEAKER_14]: I said it was a killer.

1414
01:23:06,489 --> 01:23:14,174
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, there it was, your ten songs, Bubble Bobble, Tempest, Burger Time, Crystal Castles, Frogger, 1943, Dig Dug, Zaxxon, Pengo, Tower of Druaga.

1415
01:23:14,194 --> 01:23:18,057
[SPEAKER_14]: That was killer, but Rob D., you made a good showing, and we appreciate your participation.

1416
01:23:18,557 --> 01:23:20,918
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thanks for taking my call, and thanks for letting me participate.

1417
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:24,601
[SPEAKER_14]: And as a consolation prize, a lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni.

1418
01:23:25,325 --> 01:23:26,125
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, sounds great.

1419
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:26,886
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, have a good one.

1420
01:23:26,906 --> 01:23:27,766
[SPEAKER_08]: San Francisco treat.

1421
01:23:27,986 --> 01:23:28,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll see you guys later.

1422
01:23:28,986 --> 01:23:29,627
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, later, buddy.

1423
01:23:30,567 --> 01:23:31,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess-a-roni.

1424
01:23:32,328 --> 01:23:33,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Rice Princess-a-roni?

1425
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:34,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

1426
01:23:35,089 --> 01:23:35,849
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, there you go.

1427
01:23:37,149 --> 01:23:37,510
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1428
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:41,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Tetsuya said he would have gotten five, and he knew the Tower of Druaga.

1429
01:23:41,971 --> 01:23:43,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks like some folks knew Pingo.

1430
01:23:43,212 --> 01:23:44,052
[SPEAKER_14]: That was very good.

1431
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:48,414
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, Zaxxon sounded so familiar, and then I just had to think about it for a little bit.

1432
01:23:48,454 --> 01:23:50,595
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, ah, crap.

1433
01:23:50,715 --> 01:23:51,655
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a tough one.

1434
01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:56,385
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the way, I pulled all those games off GameTap earlier today because I have a bunch of those games.

1435
01:23:56,745 --> 01:24:00,007
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really easy for me to dump when the game is on a computer, the audio.

1436
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:05,050
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I picked Zaxxon at first, I was like, oh, it'll be easy to recognize.

1437
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:06,791
[SPEAKER_14]: And like I was playing, I was like, this is really hard.

1438
01:24:06,831 --> 01:24:08,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe I should switch it out.

1439
01:24:08,071 --> 01:24:10,012
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, I kept it in there.

1440
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:12,413
[SPEAKER_14]: But the Tower of Draugr, man, that's killer.

1441
01:24:12,774 --> 01:24:13,374
[SPEAKER_14]: That is freaking killer.

1442
01:24:13,394 --> 01:24:13,954
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what would be cool?

1443
01:24:13,974 --> 01:24:17,596
[SPEAKER_16]: You should do old PC games or something like that because no one would get that stuff.

1444
01:24:17,676 --> 01:24:17,976
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1445
01:24:18,396 --> 01:24:21,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob D in chat, he's back in chat and yelling...

1446
01:24:21,843 --> 01:24:22,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Coji Kondo

1447
01:24:50,403 --> 01:24:51,384
[SPEAKER_14]: If you know who he is, anyway.

1448
01:24:51,984 --> 01:24:52,864
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the author.

1449
01:24:52,884 --> 01:24:56,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he made Legend of Zelda music, Star Fox, Mario.

1450
01:24:57,066 --> 01:24:58,406
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the guy's a legend, right?

1451
01:24:58,786 --> 01:25:04,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he is going to be performing at Video Games Live this year in San Francisco.

1452
01:25:05,088 --> 01:25:07,249
[SPEAKER_14]: That's March 9th at 8 p.m.

1453
01:25:07,289 --> 01:25:11,791
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the show during the Game Developers Conference, which I may or may not be going to.

1454
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:13,771
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still trying to work out some last-minute details.

1455
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:14,812
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping to go to...

1456
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:18,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I really wanna go just to see this.

1457
01:25:18,191 --> 01:25:19,051
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it'll be great.

1458
01:25:19,171 --> 01:25:20,091
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the songs they play...

1459
01:25:38,439 --> 01:25:39,560
[SPEAKER_14]: at a Video Games Live.

1460
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I get, but I think it would be really cool.

1461
01:25:42,261 --> 01:25:45,703
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like, I did not get into some of the LucasArts games like a lot of people did.

1462
01:25:45,743 --> 01:25:53,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I do love Loom and Monkey Island, some of that stuff, but apparently they're going to have some LucasArts stuff, and apparently there's going to be a Contra presentation, which should be interesting.

1463
01:25:53,966 --> 01:25:55,667
[SPEAKER_14]: But when I think about Contra, I don't think about the music.

1464
01:25:55,887 --> 01:25:56,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it just me?

1465
01:25:56,888 --> 01:25:57,228
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1466
01:25:57,368 --> 01:26:02,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the last, you know, games were pretty, you know, heavy metal, which would be kind of cool to see perform live.

1467
01:26:03,431 --> 01:26:04,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, Kira.

1468
01:26:04,391 --> 01:26:05,052
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be awesome.

1469
01:26:05,172 --> 01:26:05,432
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1470
01:26:06,058 --> 01:26:10,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess we've got one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR.

1471
01:26:11,102 --> 01:26:19,688
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, the big story is Itagaki is working on something new, and something that doesn't have to do with boobies, apparently.

1472
01:26:19,768 --> 01:26:20,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it day rape?

1473
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:23,691
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not day rape.

1474
01:26:23,771 --> 01:26:24,612
[SPEAKER_16]: But here's the thing, though.

1475
01:26:25,012 --> 01:26:25,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone's like...

1476
01:26:26,918 --> 01:26:27,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1477
01:26:54,403 --> 01:26:54,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

1478
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:56,044
[SPEAKER_14]: We're back to that again, huh?

1479
01:26:56,064 --> 01:26:57,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you say me and Almond Joy here?

1480
01:26:57,725 --> 01:26:58,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yay.

1481
01:26:59,106 --> 01:26:59,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry.

1482
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:00,027
[SPEAKER_14]: We're on the air.

1483
01:27:01,288 --> 01:27:02,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Almond Joy.

1484
01:27:02,069 --> 01:27:02,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Coconut.

1485
01:27:02,589 --> 01:27:03,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, almonds.

1486
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:06,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Or as my dad would say, Ammon Joy.

1487
01:27:06,432 --> 01:27:07,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's shaped like an egg.

1488
01:27:07,172 --> 01:27:08,093
[SPEAKER_14]: I can shove it up your ass.

1489
01:27:08,133 --> 01:27:08,814
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd probably like that.

1490
01:27:09,214 --> 01:27:09,974
[SPEAKER_10]: You have some almonds?

1491
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:10,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Some almonds?

1492
01:27:11,035 --> 01:27:11,656
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what my dad says.

1493
01:27:11,676 --> 01:27:12,516
[SPEAKER_14]: You like almonds?

1494
01:27:13,557 --> 01:27:14,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Almonds are crunchy.

1495
01:27:14,778 --> 01:27:17,420
[SPEAKER_14]: You know they have a big almond factory in downtown Sacramento.

1496
01:27:18,381 --> 01:27:18,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah?

1497
01:27:19,021 --> 01:27:19,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Diamond.

1498
01:27:19,421 --> 01:27:20,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you ever driven by it?

1499
01:27:21,423 --> 01:27:22,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

1500
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:22,884
[SPEAKER_14]: We're on a video game show.

1501
01:27:23,168 --> 01:27:27,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess we should let some callers call in and direct the show otherwise.

1502
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:30,291
[SPEAKER_14]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, there's always our Skype line, username OrangeLoungeRadio.

1503
01:27:30,551 --> 01:27:36,014
[SPEAKER_14]: There's more information on our website, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, by clicking on Interact With Us.

1504
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to the phones.

1505
01:27:37,534 --> 01:27:38,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1506
01:27:38,515 --> 01:27:38,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1507
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:40,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven's Dolphin.

1508
01:27:40,716 --> 01:27:41,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Raven's Dolphin.

1509
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:43,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I got time to eat my egg here.

1510
01:27:43,617 --> 01:27:44,417
[SPEAKER_14]: You like Almond Joys?

1511
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:46,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Almond Joys.

1512
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:47,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, it's good stuff.

1513
01:27:47,419 --> 01:27:48,279
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, what's on your mind, buddy?

1514
01:27:49,187 --> 01:27:50,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I like GameTap, especially Abe Lincoln Must Die.

1515
01:28:16,621 --> 01:28:17,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't even played that.

1516
01:28:17,361 --> 01:28:18,202
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell is that?

1517
01:28:18,362 --> 01:28:18,962
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds awesome.

1518
01:28:18,982 --> 01:28:20,222
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a new Sam & Max episode.

1519
01:28:21,282 --> 01:28:21,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

1520
01:28:21,803 --> 01:28:23,603
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I need to play the Sam & Max games.

1521
01:28:23,783 --> 01:28:27,905
[SPEAKER_05]: If you played Sam & Max, you would know, does the carpet match the drapes?

1522
01:28:29,385 --> 01:28:30,365
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to know the answer to that.

1523
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:34,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I seriously need to ban myself from World of Warcraft for a week so I can play some of these computer games I've been missing.

1524
01:28:35,347 --> 01:28:36,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you checked out Myst Online?

1525
01:28:38,088 --> 01:28:40,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't gotten into it, but I heard it's great.

1526
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:42,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to.

1527
01:28:43,049 --> 01:28:44,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a fan of Myst, Eddie?

1528
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:45,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I

1529
01:28:46,277 --> 01:28:47,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a huge fan of Myst.

1530
01:28:47,297 --> 01:28:47,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Myst.

1531
01:28:47,917 --> 01:28:48,497
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

1532
01:28:48,997 --> 01:28:50,278
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, it's cool.

1533
01:28:51,598 --> 01:28:53,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised you don't know about Myst online, then.

1534
01:28:53,178 --> 01:28:54,458
[SPEAKER_14]: It just opened up on Valentine's Day.

1535
01:28:54,839 --> 01:28:58,079
[SPEAKER_14]: And he has this, like, Christmas little boy face on right now.

1536
01:28:58,539 --> 01:29:03,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, because I'm, like, probably the only person who still likes point-and-click games, so I'm like, oh, Myst!

1537
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Point-and-click.

1538
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Ravenstaff and Will, what else do you have in mind tonight?

1539
01:29:09,441 --> 01:29:12,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I... Oh, I got a point to pick with Loki.

1540
01:29:13,182 --> 01:29:14,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Loki.

1541
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:16,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Raven's Dolphin is going to pick your bones.

1542
01:29:18,011 --> 01:29:18,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

1543
01:29:18,892 --> 01:29:19,932
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, what's on your mind?

1544
01:29:20,812 --> 01:29:23,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you said about 15-inch television.

1545
01:29:23,894 --> 01:29:29,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I own a 15-inch television, and I'm not gay, and you said go buy a PC monitor.

1546
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:29,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have money.

1547
01:29:29,976 --> 01:29:34,719
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom said, here, have this 15-inch HDTV monitor.

1548
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:36,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you like it for games?

1549
01:29:36,379 --> 01:29:37,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, yes.

1550
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,361
[SPEAKER_14]: When in the hell did he say that 15-inch monitors made you gay?

1551
01:29:41,842 --> 01:29:43,122
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even remember saying that.

1552
01:29:43,522 --> 01:29:44,023
[SPEAKER_15]: I never said that.

1553
01:29:44,043 --> 01:29:44,783
[SPEAKER_14]: It's interactive.

1554
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, when you are on all games on Monday, you must have said it.

1555
01:29:48,163 --> 01:29:50,425
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even remember saying that.

1556
01:29:50,566 --> 01:29:51,006
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

1557
01:29:51,026 --> 01:29:54,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Scott totally sets us up to say mean things so we get angry listeners.

1558
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:58,756
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think what I was saying... I think what I was saying... I can't remember...

1559
01:30:00,069 --> 01:30:02,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I remember now.

1560
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:08,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Because someone had a 15-inch LCD TV or whatever, and they spent, I forget how much money on it.

1561
01:30:09,134 --> 01:30:13,396
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, well, you should just go buy a fucking monitor because they're a lot cheaper.

1562
01:30:14,036 --> 01:30:21,340
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get a 19-inch or even a 21-inch or whatever, and you can do HD on a PC monitor.

1563
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:24,182
[SPEAKER_16]: So just spend the money on that instead.

1564
01:30:26,063 --> 01:30:26,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1565
01:30:27,398 --> 01:30:28,159
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, there.

1566
01:30:28,179 --> 01:30:32,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I never said gay, though, ever in that, you know, argument.

1567
01:30:33,163 --> 01:30:34,984
[SPEAKER_16]: I said retarded, but not gay.

1568
01:30:35,284 --> 01:30:36,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I was improv-ing.

1569
01:30:36,605 --> 01:30:36,905
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1570
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:37,706
[SPEAKER_14]: What else?

1571
01:30:38,106 --> 01:30:39,107
[SPEAKER_14]: One more thing.

1572
01:30:39,187 --> 01:30:40,168
[SPEAKER_14]: It's always one more thing.

1573
01:30:40,888 --> 01:30:41,149
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1574
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:43,030
[SPEAKER_14]: It's your trademark, though, you know?

1575
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:43,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1576
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:46,793
[SPEAKER_14]: You should have... Do you have a MySpace Raven's Dolphin?

1577
01:30:47,293 --> 01:30:47,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.

1578
01:30:47,874 --> 01:30:48,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yeah.

1579
01:30:48,774 --> 01:30:56,560
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to get one and put a little picture of yourself on there with little text on it that says, one more thing, and, like, you should have, like, a little picture of you going, like, with a hand.

1580
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:56,901
[SPEAKER_14]: One.

1581
01:30:57,101 --> 01:30:57,181
[SPEAKER_14]: One.

1582
01:30:58,763 --> 01:30:59,523
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your one more thing?

1583
01:31:02,106 --> 01:31:17,958
[SPEAKER_14]: My headset is orange for Orange Lounge Radio Aww I just threw up in my mouth Alright, thanks Raven Stolfen, you're cool You too, bye Alright, take care, bye Let's go to another phone call What was that?

1584
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:19,580
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell did I do there?

1585
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea I'm eagerly anticipating chicken shoot Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1586
01:31:26,175 --> 01:31:27,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.

1587
01:31:27,756 --> 01:31:29,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Paradox Vincent!

1588
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:31,259
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind?

1589
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:34,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Not much.

1590
01:31:35,722 --> 01:31:36,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Not much?

1591
01:31:36,343 --> 01:31:38,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what the hell are you calling us for tonight?

1592
01:31:38,184 --> 01:31:39,545
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you want to talk to us about?

1593
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:51,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that on the Best Buy story, did that cover their internal...

1594
01:31:54,116 --> 01:31:59,742
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole scandal on their big internal internet is their external internet website.

1595
01:32:01,203 --> 01:32:02,584
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we did not cover that story.

1596
01:32:02,644 --> 01:32:03,685
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell is this about?

1597
01:32:03,725 --> 01:32:07,049
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Best Buy, their internal is the external site?

1598
01:32:07,069 --> 01:32:07,569
[SPEAKER_14]: What's this about?

1599
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:17,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, basically, I've heard that they'll offer sales on their external website, which you can access from home.

1600
01:32:19,096 --> 01:32:26,758
[SPEAKER_11]: and they'll say, oh, well, there's a sale on this, so I want to go pick it up, you know, pick up this camera that's been discounted down to $130.

1601
01:32:28,618 --> 01:32:30,339
[SPEAKER_14]: But then you go and they won't let you have it.

1602
01:32:32,559 --> 01:32:48,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then they say, oh, that sale ended at 7 plus time and you said, well, I checked the website and they say, oh, the website must have been responding slowly, let's go check this one in store and then they'll go check it and show you, see where it ended at this date

1603
01:32:49,185 --> 01:32:52,347
[SPEAKER_11]: and, um, I just think that's true.

1604
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:20,452
[SPEAKER_16]: and then you have Walmart and Target both sell things on their website that they don't even sell in the stores the reason why they don't show you that price on there is because sometimes they will have an agreement with the publisher or whoever

1605
01:33:20,796 --> 01:33:21,096
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

1606
01:33:45,461 --> 01:33:59,452
[SPEAKER_16]: And a lot of times Best Buy is retarded, though, because I went in for a camera that was marked down and priced like a couple hundred dollars, and they said they didn't have it, but they were retarded because it was actually last year's model that, you know, it was marked down.

1607
01:33:59,492 --> 01:34:01,333
[SPEAKER_16]: They had it in, like, a shelf.

1608
01:34:01,373 --> 01:34:03,755
[SPEAKER_16]: They had to actually open up, like, a cabinet to get this thing out.

1609
01:34:04,376 --> 01:34:07,198
[SPEAKER_16]: So it might be just retarded for an employee.

1610
01:34:08,304 --> 01:34:11,946
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even think that they say that it's online only sale.

1611
01:34:12,467 --> 01:34:15,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I really don't think that it is an online only sale.

1612
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:20,511
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it's really too shady for anything.

1613
01:34:20,632 --> 01:34:21,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it shady?

1614
01:34:22,132 --> 01:34:22,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1615
01:34:22,893 --> 01:34:23,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it illegal?

1616
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:24,274
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1617
01:34:24,974 --> 01:34:28,056
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's really not a lot we can do about it but take our dollars elsewhere.

1618
01:34:29,797 --> 01:34:36,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I'm also really excited about the gold testing in Naperville because I'm really hoping that

1619
01:34:37,085 --> 01:34:44,971
[SPEAKER_11]: means they'll bring it out here and that the arcade in Arizona will get gold because it seriously needs an upgrade from that.

1620
01:34:45,272 --> 01:34:49,675
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, again, I think, again, he's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold.

1621
01:34:49,715 --> 01:34:53,918
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't know, if you're a new listener to Orange Lounge, you don't know the Bomani music game scene.

1622
01:34:54,359 --> 01:35:03,846
[SPEAKER_14]: He's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold, which is basically the 14th release for Japan, the first one they're testing in the arcades here, although they did put the game out as Beatmania on U.S.

1623
01:35:03,866 --> 01:35:04,567
[SPEAKER_14]: consoles a while ago.

1624
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:13,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you know, I think if the machine does insanely well, which it has the potential to do, I think you're going to have a lot of people driving in to play the machine from nearby areas.

1625
01:35:13,783 --> 01:35:15,684
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're going to start seeing this.

1626
01:35:15,984 --> 01:35:20,225
[SPEAKER_14]: The only blockade is going to be the machine is still going to be one of the more expensive ones to purchase.

1627
01:35:20,545 --> 01:35:23,026
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think you're going to see arcades around the areas take the plunge.

1628
01:35:23,346 --> 01:35:29,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure the Golf Land chain, which is big on the West Coast, especially California, Arizona, I'm sure they'll take the plunge.

1629
01:35:29,389 --> 01:35:30,429
[SPEAKER_14]: They usually do at Bomani Games.

1630
01:35:31,835 --> 01:35:32,795
[SPEAKER_11]: I really wish they do.

1631
01:35:33,335 --> 01:35:39,437
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's what they might have been working on while they wanted to work on Beat Mini US 2.

1632
01:35:40,537 --> 01:35:42,098
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they might have... Maybe?

1633
01:35:42,578 --> 01:35:45,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they said, what the hell are we doing two separate games for?

1634
01:35:45,599 --> 01:35:47,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just make it the same.

1635
01:35:47,379 --> 01:35:48,979
[SPEAKER_14]: And I say, it's about time.

1636
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:51,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1637
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think it's about time.

1638
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:53,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1639
01:35:53,821 --> 01:35:55,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for the call.

1640
01:35:55,761 --> 01:35:56,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, buddy.

1641
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:57,642
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll see you next time, alright?

1642
01:35:57,842 --> 01:35:58,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1643
01:35:58,682 --> 01:35:58,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Later.

1644
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:03,902
[SPEAKER_14]: and we'll keep our fingers and toes crossed that they will bring the game to you very soon.

1645
01:36:04,722 --> 01:36:06,483
[SPEAKER_14]: To all of us, because I would like to play 2DX Gold.

1646
01:36:06,523 --> 01:36:06,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know about you.

1647
01:36:07,243 --> 01:36:10,284
[SPEAKER_14]: LankyStyle, you're a big fan of Beatmania 2DX, aren't you?

1648
01:36:11,485 --> 01:36:11,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to be.

1649
01:36:12,085 --> 01:36:14,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear about Beatmania 2DX Gold testing over here in the US?

1650
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:15,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

1651
01:36:16,247 --> 01:36:16,667
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

1652
01:36:18,308 --> 01:36:19,428
[SPEAKER_14]: The 14th version.

1653
01:36:19,488 --> 01:36:21,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did you stop playing Beatmania 2DX?

1654
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:23,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been doing other things.

1655
01:36:24,591 --> 01:36:25,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Like masturbating?

1656
01:36:27,092 --> 01:36:27,232
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1657
01:36:27,792 --> 01:36:27,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1658
01:36:29,775 --> 01:36:30,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Like writing a book?

1659
01:36:31,496 --> 01:36:31,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1660
01:36:33,156 --> 01:36:34,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1661
01:36:34,337 --> 01:36:36,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1662
01:36:36,477 --> 01:36:39,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to call in again, but I do have a couple of comments to make about games.

1663
01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:39,959
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1664
01:36:39,999 --> 01:36:42,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Rob D., I suppose, as long as you're going to keep it on topic.

1665
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,821
[SPEAKER_14]: But no talking about Ammonjoys, or I'll have to hang up.

1666
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:48,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you have to worry about that from me.

1667
01:36:48,682 --> 01:36:49,022
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1668
01:36:50,403 --> 01:36:52,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, I don't know.

1669
01:36:52,863 --> 01:36:56,685
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys were talking about the Wii earlier and how it does have problems with...

1670
01:36:57,591 --> 01:37:00,995
[SPEAKER_08]: with games and games coming out, and the lack of games for it, for that matter.

1671
01:37:01,896 --> 01:37:04,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I think that all three consoles have trouble with games at this point.

1672
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:08,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, yeah, they do all have trouble with games in some way, shape, or form.

1673
01:37:08,383 --> 01:37:11,426
[SPEAKER_08]: The 360 has a lack of variety with its games.

1674
01:37:11,486 --> 01:37:17,653
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're an RPG fan, if you're a fighting game fan, if you're a platformer fan, I can't imagine you're too thrilled with the 360's game lineup.

1675
01:37:17,918 --> 01:37:21,900
[SPEAKER_14]: True, and you just said Rice Princess right there, right?

1676
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, you're my hero, Kirsten.

1677
01:37:23,801 --> 01:37:26,262
[SPEAKER_14]: This is why you have never been a big Microsoft fan, correct?

1678
01:37:26,342 --> 01:37:26,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much, yeah.

1679
01:37:27,063 --> 01:37:29,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to change your mind on 360 anytime soon?

1680
01:37:29,204 --> 01:37:29,324
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1681
01:37:29,544 --> 01:37:30,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even Blue Dragon?

1682
01:37:30,505 --> 01:37:31,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

1683
01:37:31,085 --> 01:37:31,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Rob D, keep going.

1684
01:37:33,026 --> 01:37:34,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the Wii, obviously.

1685
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:37,288
[SPEAKER_08]: It just came out, but it does have some trouble with games right now.

1686
01:37:37,408 --> 01:37:46,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of third-party developers are unwilling to hop on the bandwagon, or were unwilling to hop on the bandwagon because of the odd nature of the controller.

1687
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:51,302
[SPEAKER_08]: and now I think by Christmas you'll see a lot more developers willing to give it a shot.

1688
01:37:51,923 --> 01:37:53,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think maybe it's just the time of year?

1689
01:37:53,964 --> 01:37:56,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know, because this is usually kind of a slow period for games.

1690
01:37:56,326 --> 01:37:59,708
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't see a lot of big games start really hitting until summer.

1691
01:37:59,988 --> 01:38:02,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know, come May, June, we'll start seeing more games in November.

1692
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:04,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa, big flood of games.

1693
01:38:04,751 --> 01:38:08,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think maybe that's just part of it, why we feel a little bit robbed right now?

1694
01:38:08,613 --> 01:38:09,434
[SPEAKER_14]: No pun intended.

1695
01:38:09,574 --> 01:38:10,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably, but I think that's...

1696
01:38:11,759 --> 01:38:14,420
[SPEAKER_08]: The E3 PowerPoint Expo in May will be very telling.

1697
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:16,080
[SPEAKER_14]: The PowerPoint Expo?

1698
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:20,382
[SPEAKER_08]: To see what people announce and see what people have for the Wii, the PS3, and the 360.

1699
01:38:21,102 --> 01:38:29,024
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hearing that the E3 Elitism Expo is actually supposed to be now possibly all the way to October.

1700
01:38:30,475 --> 01:38:32,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because distribution is in a whole different category, so... Oh yeah, that.

1701
01:38:59,884 --> 01:39:02,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't it funny how no one's excited about E3 now?

1702
01:39:02,325 --> 01:39:03,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, fuck E3.

1703
01:39:03,166 --> 01:39:03,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Who gives a shit?

1704
01:39:03,946 --> 01:39:05,367
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be... Well, there went our invite.

1705
01:39:05,847 --> 01:39:08,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's no longer a rock star show like it used to be.

1706
01:39:08,529 --> 01:39:09,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.

1707
01:39:09,389 --> 01:39:11,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, actually, yeah.

1708
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:15,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's no longer a big show, and rock star is never there anyways, so we went and see Grand Theft Auto.

1709
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:15,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude.

1710
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:19,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I meant rock stars and, like, giant sound systems and that sort of thing.

1711
01:39:19,755 --> 01:39:25,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, last year when I got diverted walking around the booth because of Paris Hilton, I was pissed.

1712
01:39:25,658 --> 01:39:26,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I was so pissed.

1713
01:39:26,299 --> 01:39:28,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, this show just makes me mad.

1714
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:30,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1715
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:32,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I did have a great time.

1716
01:39:33,212 --> 01:39:34,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have a great time.

1717
01:39:34,173 --> 01:39:37,655
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really fun to play all the new games and talk about them, but damn, Paris Hilton.

1718
01:39:37,755 --> 01:39:39,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, man, fuck her.

1719
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:40,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else, Rob?

1720
01:39:41,637 --> 01:39:41,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1721
01:39:41,918 --> 01:39:43,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this Christmas is going to be very interesting.

1722
01:39:43,819 --> 01:39:48,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the coming years are going to be very interesting because the console race is really wide open this year.

1723
01:39:48,862 --> 01:39:51,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this generation.

1724
01:39:51,264 --> 01:39:54,446
[SPEAKER_08]: The established leaders problems are well documented.

1725
01:39:54,526 --> 01:39:58,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony's got a lot of problems because they're trying to make a they're trying to release a system that's

1726
01:40:00,107 --> 01:40:04,130
[SPEAKER_08]: All-in-One Media Center for $600 when all we want is a game machine.

1727
01:40:04,971 --> 01:40:16,158
[SPEAKER_14]: We ask a lot of people on the program what the PS3 can do to get a bigger foot in the marketplace here and get some of their love back from all us PS2 loyalists, because I'll tell you, I love my PlayStation 2, but I'm not so hot on the PlayStation 3.

1728
01:40:16,218 --> 01:40:20,641
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to ask you, what will Sony do, you think?

1729
01:40:22,022 --> 01:40:24,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we might see a price drop by this Christmas, honestly.

1730
01:40:24,664 --> 01:40:26,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how they're going to survive otherwise.

1731
01:40:27,086 --> 01:40:27,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't.

1732
01:40:27,666 --> 01:40:27,646
$600?

1733
01:40:27,686 --> 01:40:27,646
$500? $500?

1734
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:41,224
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot easier to convince kids' parents or even to convince 20 to 30-year-olds or teenagers with jobs to get the 360, which is going to have a price drop.

1735
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:42,544
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that by this Christmas.

1736
01:40:43,444 --> 01:40:44,385
[SPEAKER_08]: No question about that.

1737
01:40:44,585 --> 01:40:45,745
[SPEAKER_08]: They're well overdue for one.

1738
01:40:46,065 --> 01:40:47,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the Wii, which is $250.

1739
01:40:47,406 --> 01:40:48,906
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

1740
01:40:48,926 --> 01:40:52,927
[SPEAKER_14]: If worse comes to worse, though, you'll get your lame movie tie-in games that'll sell like crazy.

1741
01:40:52,967 --> 01:40:55,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Wasn't Cars the biggest selling game last year?

1742
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:56,818
[SPEAKER_14]: or something?

1743
01:40:56,838 --> 01:40:57,578
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1744
01:40:57,939 --> 01:40:59,199
[SPEAKER_14]: It was some lame movie tie-in game.

1745
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:00,580
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like the highest selling game last year.

1746
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:03,563
[SPEAKER_16]: There was, well, Madden.

1747
01:41:03,763 --> 01:41:04,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Madden's always the big one.

1748
01:41:05,804 --> 01:41:11,088
[SPEAKER_16]: And movie tie-in stuff, I don't know.

1749
01:41:11,188 --> 01:41:19,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Cars did okay, but it came out back in June and then the sales had already died by the time it came into Christmas, so.

1750
01:41:21,045 --> 01:41:23,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Zappy says Cars was number three, Madden was number one.

1751
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:37,948
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm just saying, although there may not be a lot for us hardcore gamers, the casual gamers and the kiddies, they do have a really big pull in this market we often neglect when we're coming up with all these consensuses.

1752
01:41:39,429 --> 01:41:43,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but yeah, it is Sony, so who knows if they'll actually have that price drop.

1753
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:45,450
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

1754
01:41:45,650 --> 01:41:46,570
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope so, for their sake.

1755
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:52,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Because otherwise I don't know how they're going to... Well, actually, again, the thing is, we'll see where the Japanese developers go, too.

1756
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:57,082
[SPEAKER_08]: The ones that make the platformers, the RPGs, the fighting games, because they're not too high on Microsoft.

1757
01:41:57,283 --> 01:41:59,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, at least they always have Ridge Racer.

1758
01:41:59,925 --> 01:42:00,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1759
01:42:00,885 --> 01:42:01,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Eye of Judgment.

1760
01:42:02,647 --> 01:42:04,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what they're going to do, Rob, to save themselves.

1761
01:42:05,008 --> 01:42:09,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's going to include a copy of Rainbow Island with the system.

1762
01:42:10,513 --> 01:42:11,473
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a brilliant idea.

1763
01:42:11,633 --> 01:42:11,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1764
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:13,355
[SPEAKER_14]: God, you should go work for Sony.

1765
01:42:13,635 --> 01:42:14,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't.

1766
01:42:15,096 --> 01:42:16,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Rob, for the call.

1767
01:42:17,116 --> 01:42:18,437
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thanks for taking me again.

1768
01:42:18,537 --> 01:42:19,098
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

1769
01:42:19,118 --> 01:42:20,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't play your show anymore.

1770
01:42:20,439 --> 01:42:21,360
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, no problem.

1771
01:42:21,661 --> 01:42:21,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Later.

1772
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:22,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

1773
01:42:22,922 --> 01:42:28,007
[SPEAKER_14]: We just kind of hit the answer button on whoever's on deck, but unfortunately we got to call it a night.

1774
01:42:28,227 --> 01:42:30,029
[SPEAKER_14]: We're running kind of long.

1775
01:42:30,049 --> 01:42:32,311
[SPEAKER_14]: We took a bunch of calls in Part A. We've had a lot of people on the show tonight.

1776
01:42:32,631 --> 01:42:34,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Although we do appreciate all you guys calling in.

1777
01:42:34,413 --> 01:42:35,314
[SPEAKER_14]: We're sorry to those digging through.

1778
01:42:35,334 --> 01:42:38,637
[SPEAKER_14]: There were seriously like five people still hammering the line, so I'm so sorry to those of you guys.

1779
01:42:38,677 --> 01:42:40,399
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll try to get you guys next week.

1780
01:42:40,499 --> 01:42:41,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1781
01:42:42,142 --> 01:42:43,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, you make me feel bad.

1782
01:42:43,383 --> 01:42:44,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to do one real quick?

1783
01:42:44,644 --> 01:42:46,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure, even though you just hung up on something.

1784
01:42:46,605 --> 01:42:48,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Real, real, real freaking quick.

1785
01:42:48,426 --> 01:42:49,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, 60 seconds.

1786
01:42:49,587 --> 01:42:50,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange House Radio, who's this?

1787
01:42:51,188 --> 01:42:51,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Legend of Zaku.

1788
01:42:51,889 --> 01:42:52,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Zaku, get it out.

1789
01:42:54,110 --> 01:43:01,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, just the fact that it's my understanding that the PS3 is just going to become that sinking ship, the Titanic.

1790
01:43:02,535 --> 01:43:03,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

1791
01:43:04,236 --> 01:43:05,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll never let go, Zaku.

1792
01:43:05,977 --> 01:43:06,718
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll never let go.

1793
01:43:07,438 --> 01:43:08,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, please, yes.

1794
01:43:11,636 --> 01:43:21,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just worried about, you know, honestly, you know, what I'm worried about right now is other games, you know, such as Crackdown, selling other things like, you know, for example, the Halo 3 beta.

1795
01:43:22,522 --> 01:43:33,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seeing that Crackdown is a really good game, I don't know if, you know, the Halo 3, all that hype might actually, you know, help the series in the long term.

1796
01:43:34,905 --> 01:43:39,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Zaku, with the remaining 15 seconds, how can Sony get out of this mess?

1797
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:42,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Minus the Final Fantasy XIII and Metal Gear Solid 4.

1798
01:43:44,273 --> 01:43:45,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Minus the two big ones.

1799
01:43:45,614 --> 01:43:46,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody knows about those.

1800
01:43:46,635 --> 01:43:47,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Minus those two.

1801
01:43:48,757 --> 01:43:51,579
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to get more downloadable content, more downloadable games.

1802
01:43:52,259 --> 01:43:54,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Flow and Qbert, I think, are not cutting it right now.

1803
01:43:55,362 --> 01:43:59,525
[SPEAKER_06]: So they need that and just, you know... But what about Warlock?

1804
01:44:00,366 --> 01:44:01,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that too, but...

1805
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:08,058
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have to also consider that it needs to compete with the likes of the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console.

1806
01:44:08,098 --> 01:44:11,159
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to get all their cards out just to be in the same footing.

1807
01:44:11,399 --> 01:44:11,939
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what they need?

1808
01:44:11,959 --> 01:44:12,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Achievement points.

1809
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:13,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously.

1810
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:13,760
[SPEAKER_06]: That too.

1811
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:14,500
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1812
01:44:15,021 --> 01:44:17,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Zaku, gotta let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

1813
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:18,282
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1814
01:44:18,382 --> 01:44:18,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Later, buddy.

1815
01:44:19,422 --> 01:44:19,663
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1816
01:44:19,703 --> 01:44:20,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

1817
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:20,903
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1818
01:44:21,043 --> 01:44:21,363
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1819
01:44:22,404 --> 01:44:23,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I just feel bad for this one.

1820
01:44:24,405 --> 01:44:24,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, who's this?

1821
01:44:26,425 --> 01:44:27,105
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Ranma.

1822
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:32,227
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm still pissed that I was on a pod coming up from a con while I missed an awesome show last week.

1823
01:44:32,647 --> 01:44:33,388
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry to hear that.

1824
01:44:33,708 --> 01:44:34,168
[SPEAKER_14]: 30 seconds.

1825
01:44:34,308 --> 01:44:35,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Quick, con review.

1826
01:44:36,349 --> 01:44:36,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1827
01:44:36,969 --> 01:44:37,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Con was great.

1828
01:44:37,989 --> 01:44:42,871
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the guys in the chat, Mr. Wonderful, will be doing a complete con report for you guys and you should have it by next week.

1829
01:44:43,171 --> 01:44:48,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to reiterate for Best Buy, yes, they do price max, but the trick is there's got to be a local store in the area.

1830
01:44:48,894 --> 01:44:49,254
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?

1831
01:44:49,854 --> 01:44:50,454
[SPEAKER_14]: That's beautiful.

1832
01:44:50,494 --> 01:44:51,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ranma.

1833
01:44:52,215 --> 01:44:52,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Later.

1834
01:44:52,575 --> 01:44:52,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

1835
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:54,369
[SPEAKER_14]: All our calls should be like that.

1836
01:44:54,549 --> 01:44:56,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, he's like fucking in and out.

1837
01:44:56,190 --> 01:44:57,090
[SPEAKER_13]: He knows the sound of it.

1838
01:44:57,110 --> 01:44:57,350
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

1839
01:44:57,410 --> 01:44:59,451
[SPEAKER_03]: You just do that every time.

1840
01:44:59,571 --> 01:45:00,032
[SPEAKER_03]: In and out.

1841
01:45:00,092 --> 01:45:00,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, get it out.

1842
01:45:01,072 --> 01:45:01,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.

1843
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:02,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Whip it out now.

1844
01:45:02,613 --> 01:45:06,035
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 seconds or die.

1845
01:45:06,055 --> 01:45:09,237
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be beautiful.

1846
01:45:09,377 --> 01:45:10,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1847
01:45:10,877 --> 01:45:11,618
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1848
01:45:11,818 --> 01:45:16,020
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what just happened there, but I do know it's time to ask if there's any last-minute stories.

1849
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:16,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki?

1850
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:19,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki has his hand out for a microphone.

1851
01:45:19,022 --> 01:45:19,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me...

1852
01:45:20,333 --> 01:45:20,633
[SPEAKER_16]: LaserCats

1853
01:45:43,126 --> 01:45:48,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of which, God damn it, right there, that's what the PlayStation 3 needs.

1854
01:45:49,331 --> 01:45:50,532
[SPEAKER_14]: LaserCats the game.

1855
01:45:51,433 --> 01:45:55,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Show of hands, if they put out LaserCats the game on the PlayStation 3, who would buy?

1856
01:45:55,576 --> 01:45:56,997
[SPEAKER_14]: All the hands in the room are up.

1857
01:45:57,077 --> 01:45:58,118
[SPEAKER_14]: My feet are up too.

1858
01:45:58,258 --> 01:45:59,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, there it is.

1859
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, somebody put a phone call into Sony right now.

1860
01:46:03,262 --> 01:46:05,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, look up Sony's number.

1861
01:46:05,304 --> 01:46:06,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we call them right now?

1862
01:46:09,327 --> 01:46:10,868
[SPEAKER_16]: And speaking of which, we need to go play LaserCats.

1863
01:46:12,065 --> 01:46:12,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Yo, soon.

1864
01:46:12,685 --> 01:46:13,186
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, fine.

1865
01:46:13,446 --> 01:46:13,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Keys are true.

1866
01:46:14,486 --> 01:46:16,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, LaserCats, the game could save the PlayStation 3.

1867
01:46:17,108 --> 01:46:17,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

1868
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:19,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a LaserCat.

1869
01:46:20,529 --> 01:46:21,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

1870
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:22,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knows what we're talking about, do they?

1871
01:46:24,331 --> 01:46:25,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, they totally should.

1872
01:46:25,932 --> 01:46:30,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Paradox, Vincent, Chat, Hands, Feet, SSJ100, Matt, LaserCats over Thundercats.

1873
01:46:32,555 --> 01:46:33,496
[SPEAKER_14]: ActDeft says nope.

1874
01:46:34,456 --> 01:46:37,898
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they should just have a LaserCats cover for the Wiimote.

1875
01:46:37,918 --> 01:46:38,658
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1876
01:46:39,098 --> 01:46:39,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, sorry to interrupt.

1877
01:46:39,999 --> 01:46:40,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

1878
01:46:41,055 --> 01:46:41,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's make one.

1879
01:46:42,175 --> 01:46:43,436
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll sell it on eBay.

1880
01:46:43,516 --> 01:46:46,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like cut out a stuffed animal cat.

1881
01:46:46,677 --> 01:46:48,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like take the stuffing out of a stuffed animal cat.

1882
01:46:48,737 --> 01:46:49,237
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

1883
01:46:49,317 --> 01:46:50,298
[SPEAKER_09]: And like slide it over the window.

1884
01:46:50,318 --> 01:46:51,198
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we're going to go further.

1885
01:46:51,278 --> 01:46:56,379
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to get an actual cat, you know, get a taxidermist to make one.

1886
01:46:56,399 --> 01:46:57,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Meow, meow, meow.

1887
01:46:58,060 --> 01:46:59,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Eddie, you forgot one thing.

1888
01:47:00,561 --> 01:47:01,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I just started using laser cat skin.

1889
01:47:05,822 --> 01:47:07,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I love laser cats.

1890
01:47:07,483 --> 01:47:08,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

1891
01:47:09,045 --> 01:47:10,366
[SPEAKER_14]: We should be designing games.

1892
01:47:10,926 --> 01:47:11,807
[SPEAKER_14]: And cats.

1893
01:47:12,407 --> 01:47:16,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's quit the show and start Orange Lounge Games, even though that Konami might sue us over that.

1894
01:47:17,211 --> 01:47:20,574
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just start, you know, Orange Tabby Cat.

1895
01:47:20,774 --> 01:47:24,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Or, I don't know, we'll start, you know, Peach Lounge Games or something.

1896
01:47:24,757 --> 01:47:25,698
[SPEAKER_03]: That's terrible.

1897
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:27,440
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Sunrise?

1898
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:29,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there you go, Sunrise.

1899
01:47:29,081 --> 01:47:30,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Tangerine.

1900
01:47:30,582 --> 01:47:31,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Or Irene Mooning Me.

1901
01:47:32,143 --> 01:47:32,524
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1902
01:47:32,584 --> 01:47:32,844
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1903
01:47:33,044 --> 01:47:33,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1904
01:47:34,425 --> 01:47:35,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else, Loki?

1905
01:47:37,139 --> 01:47:37,659
[SPEAKER_16]: That's about it.

1906
01:47:38,259 --> 01:47:38,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1907
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:40,880
[SPEAKER_14]: We're dorks.

1908
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Gaming Nerd says Samurai Laser Cats.

1909
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Samurai Laser Cats.

1910
01:47:47,341 --> 01:47:48,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to watch that cartoon.

1911
01:47:49,641 --> 01:47:51,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Joshi says Orange Soda Lounge Games.

1912
01:47:51,902 --> 01:47:52,302
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1913
01:47:52,802 --> 01:47:54,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Crush Lounge Games.

1914
01:47:54,082 --> 01:47:56,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that would be another copyright infringement.

1915
01:47:57,262 --> 01:47:58,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Like two at once.

1916
01:47:58,103 --> 01:47:58,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyway.

1917
01:47:58,723 --> 01:47:59,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1918
01:47:59,743 --> 01:48:02,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1919
01:48:02,323 --> 01:48:05,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Rice Princess, thanks for being here and ruining the show with your dry wit as always.

1920
01:48:06,514 --> 01:48:07,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Your final thought.

1921
01:48:07,215 --> 01:48:08,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry wit, what?

1922
01:48:09,036 --> 01:48:14,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was thinking of this very serious, poignant matter.

1923
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:15,620
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about time.

1924
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:16,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1925
01:48:21,144 --> 01:48:22,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Eddie, your final thought.

1926
01:48:24,426 --> 01:48:25,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Hot tubs are cool.

1927
01:48:27,068 --> 01:48:27,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Pervert.

1928
01:48:28,709 --> 01:48:30,270
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1929
01:48:30,651 --> 01:48:31,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate people!

1930
01:48:32,712 --> 01:48:34,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, your final thought.

1931
01:48:34,673 --> 01:48:35,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue mittens!

1932
01:48:36,477 --> 01:48:37,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, your final thought.

1933
01:48:38,598 --> 01:48:42,160
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess reject false... Fuck the reject false icons.

1934
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:45,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Worship those false icons like never before.

1935
01:48:45,881 --> 01:48:47,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Bow down to the golden cow.

1936
01:48:51,544 --> 01:48:52,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't listen to Moses.

1937
01:48:52,825 --> 01:48:54,025
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a golden cow.

1938
01:48:56,586 --> 01:48:57,747
[SPEAKER_14]: My final thought is

1939
01:48:58,462 --> 01:48:59,183
[SPEAKER_14]: and Ammon Joy.

1940
01:49:00,645 --> 01:49:03,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.

1941
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:06,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Please leave us a five-star retune on iTunes.

1942
01:49:06,534 --> 01:49:07,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Please leave us a dig.

1943
01:49:07,896 --> 01:49:08,617
[SPEAKER_14]: What do we have to do?

1944
01:49:08,777 --> 01:49:11,441
[SPEAKER_14]: I will send Rice Princess over there to make love to you if that's what it takes.

1945
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:13,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting hot.

1946
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:16,632
[SPEAKER_14]: You should declare your love for Rice Princess in a five-star iTunes review.

1947
01:49:16,812 --> 01:49:17,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, you truly should.

1948
01:49:17,912 --> 01:49:19,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I got a message from SpeedyF40.

1949
01:49:20,133 --> 01:49:23,855
[SPEAKER_14]: It says, tell Rice Princess that I still have a crush on her because she sounds like a freak.

1950
01:49:25,075 --> 01:49:25,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, that's kind of scary.

1951
01:49:25,816 --> 01:49:28,317
[SPEAKER_14]: There's going to be a love triangle going on here.

1952
01:49:28,357 --> 01:49:28,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

1953
01:49:28,877 --> 01:49:29,337
[SPEAKER_03]: With who?

1954
01:49:29,717 --> 01:49:29,957
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1955
01:49:30,498 --> 01:49:31,078
[SPEAKER_14]: With Stacia.

1956
01:49:31,098 --> 01:49:33,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you like farting, Speedy?

1957
01:49:33,659 --> 01:49:34,439
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1958
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:38,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you need to like that to be with Rice Princess.

1959
01:49:39,167 --> 01:49:46,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Rice Princess will choose who her heart belongs to based on who leaves the most five-star iTunes reviews.

1960
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:46,890
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1961
01:49:47,411 --> 01:49:48,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And who sends me golden wow.

1962
01:49:48,931 --> 01:49:53,633
[SPEAKER_14]: No, in all seriousness, actually, remember what our new marketing director said.

1963
01:49:53,914 --> 01:49:55,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio.

1964
01:49:56,014 --> 01:49:56,735
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all we ask.

1965
01:49:57,075 --> 01:49:59,736
[SPEAKER_14]: And then if those two people tell two more people... Oh, my God.

1966
01:49:59,796 --> 01:50:01,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you Ron Poupeel?

1967
01:50:01,297 --> 01:50:04,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you tell someone, we'll give you a free food diet drink.

1968
01:50:04,278 --> 01:50:05,979
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll throw in a free Am and Joy egg.

1969
01:50:06,919 --> 01:50:07,980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's already been eaten.

1970
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send you the wrapper.

1971
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll autograph it and put it on eBay.

1972
01:50:11,201 --> 01:50:12,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll sell for billions.

1973
01:50:12,802 --> 01:50:13,462
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll sell for nothing.

1974
01:50:13,542 --> 01:50:13,842
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1975
01:50:13,902 --> 01:50:17,284
[SPEAKER_14]: We really need to end the show now, so cue the outgoing music, please.

1976
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:20,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Cue, cue.

1977
01:50:20,325 --> 01:50:22,806
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1978
01:50:23,086 --> 01:50:25,908
