00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,440
And we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 221 for this February the 25th

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,720
of 2007 and we are here with part B of our podcast.

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,160
If it's your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you should dip back into our

4
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,160
archives.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
Visit www.orangeloungeradio.com.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,100
You can hear the first half of the show where we talked about the virtual console and how

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,000
Perrin Kaplan is always the introduction to the opposite sketch and much more.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,400
We even took some calls, which is a rarity for part A.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,920
So now we're going to get into part B, some more news.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,080
Dark Soccer is not here this week, but she'll be joining us for a tape segment in part B

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,360
to do the mailbag because we always welcome your emails at mailbag.orangeloungeradio.com.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,680
It is an interactive show.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
It's not just about us.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,280
I mean, we're just some schmoes on the internet like you.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,380
We want to always welcome you guys to interact with the program.

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,800
We also have our chat room, hi chat room, waiting to interact with us.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,360
Also in part B tonight, Beat the Host.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,920
So Loki's looking forward to getting beat up a little bit.

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
A little later on in the show.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
If they choose me.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
If they choose you.

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
All right.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,400
Anyways, so apparently the rumor that Warhawk was going to be a download title is going

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,760
to be true, I guess.

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:31,720
According to 1UP's Sam Kennedy, he apparently just recently was shown by Incognito, the

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,560
brand new Warhawk game, and it is going to be a download title.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,800
And a quote from him, what Warhawk is apparently evolved into is a multiplayer only title featuring

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,920
ground and air combat that will be downloadable from the PlayStation Network.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,340
That's definitely not the Warhawk experience I'd imagined when I first saw the trailer

30
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,720
two years ago, but that's not to say that I've lost excitement over it either.

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,760
But for all I know, it could still be pretty freaking cool.

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,640
It's just not what I expected.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,640
It's very interesting to see one of these titles that was supposed to be one of the

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,680
flagship titles for Sony is now a kind of a tech demo that they're releasing now as

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,880
a multiplayer game on the PlayStation Network.

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,440
Is it really this title is that weak that it can't be released retail?

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,240
Or is it just that the PlayStation Network doesn't have anything on it, or a combination

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,520
of the two?

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Blaze doubts the truth behind this.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,120
Blaze in Chatham says 1UP is a tool of Satan, therefore they lie.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,440
Very true, but I would take it if they're going and actually visiting the studio that

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,720
maybe this is the case.

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,440
But then again, they haven't officially announced it yet, so I guess we can still call it rumor.

44
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
Would you buy this?

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Nope.

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Downloadable?

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
At all.

48
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
You know what though?

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I go, how much is it possibly going to be downloadable?

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,320
It would have been 25 bucks, and then it would have been 60 bucks as a retail title.

51
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,800
I'll have to see what the price is going to be on this, because I know one of the things

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,480
that they're pushing is full downloadable games.

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,080
So if they're just going to test the waters with Warhawk, it better be good.

54
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,560
I'll wait and hear the reviews on it, and that will determine whether I purchase it

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
or not.

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Because it's just like Qbert.

57
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,640
Qbert's a downloadable title, and just because it's downloadable doesn't mean I'm going to

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
buy it.

59
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,040
It's crap, so I'll wait.

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,160
Misty in our chat room says, aren't most game sites tools of Satan?

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Yeah, that's true.

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,680
And actually, that gives me a chance to work in a plug for AllGames.com, where our show

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,520
is rebroadcast every week, Monday nights at 5.30, unless they run long, which they usually

64
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,600
do, and Pacific time, and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

65
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,900
AllGames.com actually endorsed by Satan himself, actually.

66
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,900
So check it out.

67
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,900
Hot.

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,900
Hot, yeah, that's hot.

69
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,900
Really.

70
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Literally.

71
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Whoa, yeah.

72
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
All right.

73
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Do you care about Warhawk at All Rights Princess?

74
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,100
I don't even know what the hell that is.

75
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,800
They had it on PlayStation 1.

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,480
It's like a biplane, like old shooting type game.

77
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
I mean, you're into bi.

78
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,940
It was done by the same people that did Twisted Metal, and it was one of those kind of air

79
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,400
combat games.

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,920
But it was one of the big things that they were showing off the six axis controller at

81
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,760
E3, and I remember laughing my ass off when I saw the guy demoing it, and he barely landed

82
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,960
this thing on the little landing pad, because the thing was like practically falling off

83
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,320
of the landing pad, because he just sucked balls at actually using this.

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
So that was kind of funny.

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,320
I would have loved to see him like land it and the whole thing tip over and fall into

86
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,480
the water, but alas, we can't always get what we want.

87
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
All right.

88
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,820
Well, some other PlayStation 3 news for you guys.

89
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,000
If you guys have been kind of QQing over the fact that there's not a lot of, and I don't

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,500
mean lining up, a lot of PlayStation 3 exclusives coming out, what's interesting is that they

91
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,760
are going to be getting some exclusives for Spider-Man 3, which I believe is a Sony picture

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
movie.

93
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
Of course.

94
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
I'm not mistaken.

95
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,600
What's interesting about it is that Activision will be putting out a PlayStation 3 exclusive

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,080
version of Spider-Man 3, but it's just the collector's edition that's exclusive.

97
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,000
The game itself will still be out on other platforms, but with the collector's edition

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,400
exclusive to the PlayStation 3, you get some webisodes for the Spider-Man 3 movie, an exclusive

99
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,360
interview with the producer, behind the scenes talk with the dreamy Tobey Maguire and Topher

100
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:26,200
Grace and James Franco, but oddly enough, Kirsten Dunst is not listed here, so she must

101
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,400
have been a bitch and not done it, especially Spider-Man 3 trailers as well.

102
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,800
As well as you get to play as the second Green Goblin in the game, there's going to be submissions.

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,680
Thank you for ruining the next part of the story.

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Well, I thought you were done.

105
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
No, I was not done.

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
You paused.

107
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
You were a long pauser.

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,960
But I will say this, it also interfaces with the 6-axis controller.

109
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,000
What, you don't care about Spider-Man 3, Eddie?

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,880
No, but does the PlayStation 3 version exclusively suck?

111
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
I don't know.

112
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
It's a little early to judge.

113
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,600
It's going to be Spider-Man 3.

114
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
Most of the Spider-Man games actually have done pretty well.

115
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Yeah, they're pretty good.

116
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,800
Except for me, the last one, the Ultimate Spider-Man is kind of lame, but there's no

117
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,720
movie coming out at the time.

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
Alpha Canagram says, duh, the Spider-Man font is on the PlayStation 3.

119
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,920
Well, that's just because they're just unoriginal, so they're going to use that.

120
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,000
We can't think of a font for the PlayStation 3.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,480
Ah, fuck it, let's just steal it.

122
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,520
It's our property anyways.

123
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
So fuck them.

124
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:35,800
Anyways, speaking of fucking over things, PlayStation 3 is going to be $1,000 in Australia.

125
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,120
That's Australian dollars, of course.

126
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,200
But that still equals up to $788 U.S. or 599 Euros.

127
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,960
So yeah, that kind of sucks.

128
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,160
Holy crap, mate.

129
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:58,880
And apparently they say that it's the same price as the European PS3.

130
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,080
It's just because the current exchange rate and the small population size of Australia,

131
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,860
they're just going to get fucked over.

132
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,040
Put another PlayStation 3 on the barbie.

133
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,160
You hear those clicks?

134
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,880
Those are all of our Australian listeners unsubscribing right there.

135
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,320
You know what, though?

136
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,320
The thing is, it may be more expensive, but you know what?

137
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,200
They're going to be including Casino Royale with it, so I'm sure that will make up for

138
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,960
the extra hundreds of dollars that you're going to have to pay for it.

139
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,720
The other thing also, which is kind of good, there was a rumor going around that there

140
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,740
was only going to be 11,000 units in Australia, which at that price point, I wouldn't be surprised.

141
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,720
But apparently it is going to be more than that, so if you are waiting to get your hands

142
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,280
on a PlayStation 3, just do what most of us are doing, just wait.

143
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,720
Leave it to the chat room to be making the Australia comments.

144
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,400
Mel B says, PS3, Australian for ripped off.

145
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,360
Like the commercials for the beer, get it?

146
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,120
And then Rama says, crikes, Australia's taking one up the arse.

147
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,080
You have the worst Australian accent, period.

148
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,000
My Australia sounds like a Scottish guy and my British sounds like an Australian guy.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,640
It all just kind of sounds the same.

150
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,480
It's like your t-shirt dude slash straight guy, whatever.

151
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,600
You just don't try very hard, do you, Rama?

152
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,120
Look, I'm not on this show because I'm funny, okay?

153
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
We know that.

154
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
I don't know why I'm on this program.

155
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Yeah, we don't know either.

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
I really don't know.

157
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,640
Oh, I'm on this program to give release dates to you every week from Japan, where there's

158
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,120
being made fun of of the Australians.

159
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
Heck, why don't we just travel on over to Japan?

160
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,960
Let's make fun of them, too, and their release dates for the upcoming week.

161
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,080
Coming out, let's see, on March 1st for the PlayStation 3, Gundam Musou, God, is this

162
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
the Gundam game we got here?

163
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
No, Gundam Musou is even better.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Gundam Musou is...

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,020
That's Mobile Suit Gundam, isn't it?

166
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,440
It's Mobile Suit Gundam mixed with Dynasty Warriors.

167
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,920
And there's a moose in it, too.

168
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:04,280
Dynasty Gundam, where you're fighting hundreds and hundreds of AI retarded...

169
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
That's a pass.

170
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Thank you.

171
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Robots.

172
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,800
Let's see, what's coming out over on the Nintendo Wii?

173
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,920
We have Densha de Go!

174
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,800
Shinkansen EX.

175
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,400
That's why you're on the show, Rob, to pronounce Japanese wrong.

176
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Thank you very much.

177
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
It's great.

178
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,840
This is a game where it looks like you simulate a train.

179
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
It's a train sim.

180
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Yay.

181
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
That should be fun.

182
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,520
It's like a train on the Nintendo Wii.

183
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,280
That'll be fun.

184
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,800
Coming out on the PlayStation 2.

185
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
You ready?

186
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Sure.

187
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Interlude.

188
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,280
But that's moving into the best version, so that doesn't really count.

189
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Aku Daikan 3 is coming out.

190
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Sumimasen.

191
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,680
I like this, because this is the best cover I think I've ever seen.

192
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,880
Is that you have these real people, and there's this guy on the cover that's making this face

193
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
like, huh?

194
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
What do you want?

195
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
He's like, I farted.

196
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
You looking at me, bitch?

197
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,780
I don't know what the hell type of game this is.

198
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
It's a strategy game.

199
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,800
I'm going to post the link there and chat room for those that want to see the cover

200
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
of that game.

201
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,520
That's one of my favorite covers I've seen in a long time.

202
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,640
Let's see.

203
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,240
What else do we have coming out over in Japan?

204
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,720
On the Nintendo DS, a handful of games coming out, Super Robot Taisen W is coming out.

205
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Let's see.

206
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,020
Oh, Disney Meteos is almost out.

207
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
That's March.

208
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
Disney Meteos?

209
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Oh, that's the US.

210
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
Like Meteos?

211
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,020
Never mind.

212
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,020
That's March 5th in the US.

213
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
Sorry.

214
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
I'm not going to release any other release dates.

215
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
That's all I got.

216
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Not a big week for releases in Japan.

217
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,020
Darn.

218
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,480
I'm also doing Euro release dates tonight, though, because Dark Soccer is not here, so

219
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:40,200
let me quickly get them out getting out some release dates.

220
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,520
Let's see.

221
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,920
The Elder Scrolls on the PSP is slated for March 1st.

222
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,280
Also slated for March 1st, Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass.

223
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
That doesn't sound right.

224
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,480
I thought that game got hella delayed.

225
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,280
You got hella delayed.

226
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,800
That's interesting.

227
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
What the hell?

228
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,040
These don't even sound like legitimate release dates.

229
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,400
They're talking about Resident Evil 5 on the Xbox 360?

230
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
What?

231
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
No.

232
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
No.

233
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I think there's just some placeholders on this calendar here.

234
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Wrong.

235
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I would believe this, though.

236
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Yu-Gi-Oh!

237
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
GX coming out on the 2nd for the PSP.

238
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
That certainly seems legit.

239
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Still no one cares.

240
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,440
Sonic and the Secret Rings for the Wii also on the 2nd.

241
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
There you have it.

242
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Uh-huh.

243
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Awesome.

244
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Wait.

245
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,360
Speaking of Resident Evil, is that on your agenda tonight?

246
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
I don't think so.

247
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,720
The Resident Evil 3 trailer came out for the movie?

248
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,320
No, it definitely was not on the agenda tonight.

249
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Oh.

250
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Well, the trailer's out.

251
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
And?

252
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
So go watch it.

253
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
It's called Resident Evil Extinction.

254
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,400
It actually doesn't show a lot.

255
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
It just kind of...

256
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,660
You know how on one of the first two movies, they show the fake umbrella commercial where

257
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:44,600
it's the face stuff or whatever, and if you've seen the cosmetic thing, whatever, it was

258
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
kind of like that.

259
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,080
They're like, we just don't even want to try anymore.

260
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Yeah, kind of.

261
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,040
But I'm still going to see it because I like Resident Evil.

262
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,880
Rob D.'s making fun of me in chat saying, March 2007, Duke Nukem Forever coming to the

263
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Wii.

264
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Screw you.

265
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,880
ActDeaf says, Resident Evil 3 was filmed in my city.

266
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,920
So you live in Raccoon City?

267
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,440
Are there a lot of raccoons?

268
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,480
Okay, yeah, so that's it.

269
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,600
That's all I wanted to say.

270
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,760
Let's get some definite for sure release dates, Loki.

271
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Wait.

272
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,280
Well, nothing's ever definite for sure.

273
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,680
I shouldn't try and fill in for Jamie.

274
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,240
I just shouldn't.

275
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,160
Let's see, some exclusive stuff real quick, and this isn't all that great.

276
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,360
It's already been announced, Command & Conquer 3 for the 360.

277
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,120
It is coming out now, though, May 9th, so that's kind of cool.

278
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,480
Definitely needs some more real-time strategy stuff.

279
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,320
This one's kind of interesting, but not too exciting.

280
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,400
Backyard Football 08, and this is one of those franchises.

281
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,620
It's the only kid franchise for sports games, and it is coming to the Wii and PlayStation

282
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:54,280
2, but that's all the way in September 27th.

283
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Definitely a budget Atari title that they keep putting out each year.

284
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,120
Arioma says Backyard Football is the best ever.

285
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,920
Okay, well, there you go.

286
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
The best ever.

287
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,680
I'll stick with that.

288
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,120
Anyways, this week, though, we've got some good stuff coming out.

289
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,520
On the 360, we have Bullet Witch, which is going to be pretty awesome, and if you're

290
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,080
definitely looking for some scantily clad witches fighting demons.

291
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,680
Oh, that's perfect.

292
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,520
And I do believe that there is a download where you can get a schoolgirl outfit for

293
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,840
her, so that's awesome.

294
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,520
Also on the 360, Dance Dance Revolution Universe, finally making its way out, and I'm picking

295
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
this up.

296
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
I can't wait to try it out.

297
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,120
Of course, I'm not going to be able to use a dance pad, but, you know, upstairs apartment

298
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,320
and all.

299
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,800
Samurai Warriors 2 Empires.

300
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,760
Okay, shit, I'm buying it anyway.

301
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Listeners can deal.

302
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,680
If I have to hear them practicing guitar or piano or whatever they have down there, they're

303
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,560
going to hear me playing DDR.

304
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Like it!

305
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,680
Samurai Warriors 2 Empires, coming out on the 360 and Playstation 2.

306
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,480
If you're even remotely interested in this, it's basically the same damn game that came

307
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,360
out in September.

308
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,960
On the Playstation 2 as well, MLB 2K7, that is also coming out on the Xbox, the 360, Playstation

309
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,440
3, and I believe the PSP, so if you need some baseball, you can get there.

310
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,560
Otherwise MLB 07, the show, is also coming out on Playstation 2.

311
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,400
On the Wii, we've got SSX Blur, which, you know, SSX is an awesome snowboarding game,

312
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,360
so definitely check that out.

313
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,780
Playstation 3, you've got Formula 1 Championship Edition, if you're a racing fan, you might

314
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
like that.

315
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:35,480
On the PSP, Chilli Con Carnage, which is, I believe, Total Overdose on the PSP now,

316
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,640
and 300 March to Glory, a PSP game based on the upcoming Frank Miller movie and comic.

317
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,800
Finally, also on the PC, we've got Jade Empire Special Edition, which looks pretty cool.

318
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:59,040
Also Sims 2 Seasons, you know, expansion pack for Sims 2, and I do believe that is it.

319
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,640
Oh, I think Luminous Plus might be coming, no I think it already came out, I can't remember.

320
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,160
That's moved around so many times.

321
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,000
I think it did, because DMM mentioned it when he called in earlier.

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,160
Yeah, but I think Source got it early, so they might have broken street on it.

323
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,640
I'm almost positive I saw it at a game stop like two months ago, but as much as I love

324
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,180
Luminous, I'm not buying it again.

325
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,720
I have it on PSP twice, I have it on 360, I don't need it again.

326
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Really I don't.

327
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
It's a good game.

328
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,960
It's good, but it's not, you know, freaking buy it four times good.

329
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,560
And of course, you know, on Virtual Console, though, you've got, what is it, Ocarina of

330
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,880
Time coming out, so if you want to purchase a game virtually, you can go ahead and do

331
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
that.

332
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Yeah, because I don't already have the GameCube disc and the version.

333
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,400
How many times have they released that game?

334
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Too many.

335
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Yeah.

336
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
All right.

337
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,320
Anyhow, speaking of buying things, one of the places very popular for folks to buy games

338
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
at is Circuit City.

339
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,280
Well, what's interesting about this is that Circuit City is testing a new program online

340
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,440
and at select stores.

341
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,000
They are now dabbling in used game sales, so it looks like they want to start competing

342
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,280
with places like GameStop.

343
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,240
Of course, this means, you know, games are usually selling about five dollars cheaper

344
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,640
than they usually do.

345
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,160
The prices, it appears, according to reports, are about the same that you would see at a

346
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,960
GameStop.

347
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,400
But of course, Circuit City wants a piece of that billion dollar market, apparently,

348
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,160
that GameStop EB Games has.

349
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,360
I think a little competition for GameStop would be a healthy thing, so I totally support

350
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
this.

351
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,080
Although, I have to admit, I don't usually shop at Circuit City, but maybe that's part

352
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,880
of another reason they want to do this.

353
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,760
Maybe they'd like to get their foot in the door a little more with games, so I welcome

354
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,200
the price competition.

355
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,120
I don't think GameStop could buy Circuit City very easily like they did EB Games and whatever

356
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,360
else they've been buying lately, so I think this will be a good thing.

357
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,680
Yeah, it is a good thing as long as they don't kind of go along the same lines of their ads

358
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,880
and coupon policy, which means that, well, for example, there was a situation that happened

359
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
last month.

360
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,560
Circuit City had a flyer that ran an ad which promised to save you up to forty dollars when

361
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,840
you buy your Wii with them.

362
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,800
It says as long as you visited the website, printed the flyer, went to the shop, they

363
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,480
give you the discount.

364
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Later on, though, they said they'd take it all back.

365
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,280
They said the discount actually comes with a statement qualifying purchases excluding

366
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,880
gaming hardware and took the coupon off the site completely.

367
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,800
But apparently people went to the store and wanted the discount and they couldn't get

368
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
it.

369
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,920
Then, of course, they complained to the Better Business Bureau and so on and so forth.

370
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:44,320
The response was apparently the Better Business Bureau received a ton of responses for it.

371
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:52,040
One of the things they basically got from Circuit City was that they reserve the right

372
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:58,680
to make changes to advertisements and coupons, et cetera, whenever they want.

373
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,800
Where they can print out, you can have a coupon for forty dollars off of a system or something.

374
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,600
They can go ahead and bait and switch.

375
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,080
Huge comments from Chat Room on these two topics.

376
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,360
Joshi16 says, Circuit City will give up, me thinks.

377
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,840
Shadow Charlie says, Circuit City, they can go fuck themselves.

378
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,320
DDR Dollar Bill says, Circuit City will fall soon.

379
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,280
Blaze says, Competition for GameStop is important because there is little competition out there.

380
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,560
James Patrick says, GameStop killed EB Games.

381
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,200
I hate them for that.

382
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,040
Hitstun says, I'm starting to really miss Funkoland.

383
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,680
That made a lot of people go, Funkoland!

384
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Funkoland was awesome!

385
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,280
The way you say it's funny, like Funkoland.

386
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,160
Hey, it's exactly like it's so funky.

387
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,080
It's got a lot of funk to it.

388
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Funkoland.

389
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
All right.

390
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Yeah.

391
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,200
So we have some other stuff coming up in this segment, including Beat the Host.

392
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,660
And of course, we need to find a worthy competitor to play Beat the Host tonight.

393
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:56,460
So if you want to guess some arcade retro classics here with us, we're going to be asking

394
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,040
a question here very soon.

395
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,440
But we have a couple more stories for you first.

396
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,360
And that is this one, which I think is very interesting.

397
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,120
Apparently, Dig is trying to trademark its name.

398
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
You know Dig.com?

399
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
D-I-G-G.com.

400
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,080
They're trying to trademark their name.

401
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
And let me work in a cheap plug.

402
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,140
If you would, Orange Lounge Radio is on Dig.

403
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,920
And we used to be on the first page, but WC Radio really kicked our butt.

404
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Thanks.

405
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Thanks for that, Speedy.

406
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
No, just kidding.

407
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,800
But a lot of shows are kicking our butt there on Dig, including the Corpcast.

408
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,260
So we need help.

409
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,240
So if you would like to Dig our show, head on over to Dig.com, click on Podcast, search

410
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Orange Lounge.

411
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
You'll find us.

412
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Give us a Dig.

413
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
I'm sure somebody will post a link in chat.

414
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,740
We could also use reviews on iTunes.

415
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,740
And I'll tell you what.

416
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,280
We actually had two people post reviews last week, so the OLR is the festering rash of

417
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
internet radio.

418
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Awesome.

419
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Awesome work.

420
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,640
And then UNI made a more serious review.

421
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Awesome work, people.

422
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,960
I'm so proud of the OLR me.

423
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,280
So we definitely need more Digs and more reviews.

424
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,840
Anyhow, so you know Dig, the social networking site.

425
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,640
Well get this, apparently LucasArts is trying to interfere with this trademark.

426
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,000
They have actually put in an injunction or whatever, filed an opposition, shall we say,

427
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,120
because they had a game in 1995 called The Dig.

428
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,560
And because Dig has a gaming page and you have this game called The Dig, LucasArts says

429
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
it's too confusing.

430
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
But what?

431
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,960
It's not even spelled the same way or anything.

432
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,000
Like that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.

433
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That is terrible.

434
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's pretty bad.

435
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Apparently it is spelled the same way.

436
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Is it The Dig?

437
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No.

438
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Because this is D-A-G-G and The Dig is just like a Dig.

439
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, the game was The Dig.

440
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,720
Well I forgot that The Dig even existed.

441
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,180
Me too.

442
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,880
How could you forget it was such a good game?

443
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,580
I don't know.

444
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,080
That's stupid.

445
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Stupid LucasArts.

446
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:52,600
It's all George Lucas' fault because he makes crappy fixes to his Star Wars movies.

447
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,720
So speaking of putting the blame on others.

448
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,360
Wait, I have to say this.

449
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,320
Speedy in chat says Dig Dug should sue.

450
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
That's true.

451
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,600
If The Dig can sue, why can't Dig Dug?

452
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,440
Why doesn't Dig Dug sue The Dig?

453
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,400
When you dig stories, don't you say Dug It?

454
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,600
Like it says, hey, you dug it.

455
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Hey man, I dug it.

456
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Yay.

457
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
You know what?

458
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Namco, get on that.

459
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:24,760
I think like grave robbers and those guys should sue people too.

460
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,840
That's it.

461
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Sorry.

462
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,840
That was stupid.

463
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
No, I'm really sorry.

464
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
I interrupted Loki.

465
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
I know.

466
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:41,760
They were at a Seattle, Washington news station and unfortunately, they're retarded but KOMO

467
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:50,880
TV, they reported on the sexual predators that are on Xbox Live and they're blaming

468
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,160
Xbox Live for apparently people.

469
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,600
Remember this whole story with the kid getting kidnapped and they apparently had some pictures

470
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,160
on live or something like that?

471
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,280
Anyways, they're documenting this 13-year-old boy playing Gears of War which that right

472
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,400
there is a mature rated game.

473
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,320
Parents obviously not paying attention to what this kid is doing.

474
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,200
Thank you by the way, case in point, I think this makes the whole story a piece of shit

475
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,040
right there that they taped a 13-year-old playing Gears of War when it says clearly

476
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,000
right there on the label, it's a mature game.

477
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,060
Anyways though, it says a parent is helpless to do anything and a grown man playing the

478
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:37,600
Lolita character for game points and that basically went on to talk a little bit about

479
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
it.

480
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,200
It's all sensationalism basically but they were also talking about how there's no way

481
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,160
that the parents have to be online or with their kids I guess or something in order for

482
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,280
the parental blocking to work or something.

483
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,220
Either way, it was one of those stories done by a local station for ratings that obviously

484
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,400
had no facts whatsoever regarding the subject and of course everybody jumps on it like you

485
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
know crazy.

486
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,760
Hey baby, why don't you come over here and I'll show you the size of my Xbox Live points

487
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
card.

488
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,640
Oh yeah.

489
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,920
That was terrible, Rom.

490
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,280
And so is the story.

491
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I know.

492
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
Whoa, don't yell at me.

493
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,760
Oh, I concur with you.

494
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,560
This has to be, I have to laugh at this.

495
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:30,360
This is also, they have a picture from Fancy Star Universe which it says right here, 500

496
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,080
for pics, 1,000 for nude cam show.

497
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,560
Oh my God.

498
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,360
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, want to see my gamer score?

499
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,880
Oh gosh.

500
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,680
It says people are from Ohio, Kansas and I'm from Washington.

501
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,560
You can just talk to each other really clear.

502
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,280
I've met other people as far away as Russia and then it says the parents are talking about

503
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
it.

504
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
We're really concerned.

505
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,000
Our problem is parents don't see this as a threat yet.

506
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,440
Of course they're not paying attention to what their kid's doing.

507
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,240
Anyways, you've got to check out the article, it's hilarious, comotv.com slash news slash

508
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,400
5983826.html or just probably just search on the website and you'll find online gaming

509
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,520
world as a forum for sex predators.

510
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,920
That's the story article but it's funny.

511
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Hey Rob.

512
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
What?

513
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,560
You want to come over and see my huge stiff boner?

514
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,520
Actually, coming from a woman, I kind of would like to see how you're going to pull that

515
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
off.

516
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Okay, 500 for pics, 1,000 for live webcam action, whatever the fuck it's in.

517
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,880
Okay, here's another one right here.

518
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,920
They're talking about apparently this kid Adam.

519
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:51,320
I think this is a 13 year old they're talking about, his mother Karen Epstein.

520
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,840
She does not know about the feature, the blocking features on Xbox Live.

521
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,320
When she opened Adam's online account, she handed him over the setup so that he can do

522
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,400
all the setup stuff for the account.

523
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,720
Okay, well apparently this parent is just stupid because she's handing over this stuff

524
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,400
to her kid and letting him get in basically all this trouble and stuff and to be honest,

525
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,400
if you're really that concerned about your kid, and to be honest, I don't think she even

526
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,880
knows that there's a threat out there with this stuff until the news person says, did

527
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,600
you know your kid can get raped from Xbox Live?

528
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,960
Then she's like, whoa, what the fuck?

529
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,240
In related news, according to that one news story we talked about a couple months ago,

530
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,600
PictoChat is raping children everywhere.

531
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Did you hear about this?

532
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,760
I'm going to start using PictoChat now.

533
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,560
Rice Princess is horny.

534
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Whatever.

535
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,960
You can't rape the willing Rice Princess.

536
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
This is true.

537
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
All right.

538
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Hey little boys.

539
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
No, I'm just kidding.

540
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
All right.

541
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Oh God.

542
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Wash my brain.

543
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Never be clean.

544
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Never be clean.

545
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
All right.

546
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Anyhow.

547
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
I don't feel yourself.

548
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Here it is kids, tonight's question.

549
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,960
The first one to send this in a private message to me in the chat room gets to play beat the

550
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,120
host tonight and you have to be willing to use Skype or call our 800 number to be a part

551
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
of the game.

552
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,480
Now, tonight's topic is classic gaming, right?

553
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,520
The question is, if you're a classic gaming expert, this should be no problem for you.

554
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,600
On what board number does Pac-Man crash?

555
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,640
That is on what board number does Pac-Man crash?

556
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
There you go.

557
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,040
I posted it on the chat room, so if you know your classic games, you know what I'm talking

558
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
about.

559
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
There it is.

560
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
All right.

561
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,400
Now, controversial stories like our last one always generate a lot of emails and we always

562
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,760
get a lot of good emails to our mailbag at orangelanatradia.com and through the magic

563
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,440
of the space-time continuum, Dark Sacra is here tonight to read us our emails.

564
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,120
Hi Jamie.

565
00:26:51,120 --> 00:27:02,040
Yo, this is the voice from beyond who isn't here because of family business.

566
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,760
Here is the mailbag and the first email comes from some guy...

567
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,000
Thank God I'm here too to interrupt you because it just wouldn't be a mailbag segment if I

568
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,560
couldn't talk too damn much.

569
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,880
Rob, I hate your Mac.

570
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,000
Hey, bring your own laptop next time.

571
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
B-Y-O-L 24 for you.

572
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,120
Hey, I was going to give you a free massage, so bite me.

573
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Massage my butt.

574
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,160
No, I'm not into the glute massage, sorry.

575
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,840
Massage my middle finger right there.

576
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
I massaged Christopher's.

577
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Did you?

578
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Yes.

579
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
All right.

580
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Good to hear.

581
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
This email comes from some dude named Mark.

582
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,080
God, why can't people just be patient?

583
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,320
Anyway, I'm sorry to say, but the standard of your show the last couple episodes has

584
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
seriously gone downhill.

585
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,280
It's becoming less of a show about video games and more about your social lives.

586
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,600
There seems to be a lot of hideous screaming and yelling.

587
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,160
It's really crossed the line of unprofessional.

588
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,360
Hey, Jamie.

589
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
I got to fart.

590
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,800
I think if Sky kept on topic and I know he tries, the show would go for half the time.

591
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,520
That's kind of funny because usually people are like, do more.

592
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
Okay.

593
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,880
Well, it's been a polarizing thing.

594
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,760
Some people with the last couple episodes have been like, oh my God, this has been like

595
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,480
the funniest things you guys have ever taped, and some people-

596
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Let me finish the email.

597
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
All right, fine.

598
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,160
I also listen to the video game show and gamer cast network, which both have the right balance

599
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,800
of humor and information.

600
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,760
It's a shame because I love hearing about Dark Sakura's obsession with collection.

601
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
You do.

602
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,800
In Loki's tech news, even when he gets so angry, he fumbles his words, LOL, but I don't

603
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,920
have the time and patience to sift through the nonsense to get the info I need.

604
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
He didn't say he unsubscribed.

605
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,400
I thought I said he unsubscribed.

606
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
No.

607
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Whatever.

608
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,960
The patience isn't spelled like... You spelled patience like-

609
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,760
See, now you're just being a bitch to him because he had something negative to say about

610
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
the show.

611
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
No, no, no, no.

612
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,080
I'm just pointing out for future reference that the type of patience that you spelled

613
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
belong in a hospital.

614
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Oh my God.

615
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Okay.

616
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
So to get back-

617
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,480
You too can send us an email and get your spelling and grammar berated by Jamie live

618
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,320
on the air and you wonder why people unsubscribe from the show.

619
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
He didn't unsubscribe.

620
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
He didn't say he unsubscribed.

621
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Sorry.

622
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Well, he didn't say he stopped listening, though.

623
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
No.

624
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
He didn't say he stopped listening.

625
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Well, hopefully-

626
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
This is a shame.

627
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,840
Well, he's going to really unsubscribe now.

628
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
No.

629
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm saying that out of the kindness of my heart.

630
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
You know what?

631
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
Yeah.

632
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
We kind of agree.

633
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Really?

634
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Are you unsubscribing from the show too?

635
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Fuck you.

636
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
No.

637
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,880
Is that why you're not here tonight?

638
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
No.

639
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,080
I'm going to my grandfather-in-law's birthday party.

640
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,080
Yeah.

641
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,200
I'm a firm believer in family values as in I believe in the value of... Never mind.

642
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Sorry.

643
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
You're getting off topic.

644
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
We need to talk more about games.

645
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,640
Is this about a video game?

646
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Is your grandpa a video game?

647
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
I don't think he is.

648
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
He's not my grandpa.

649
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Well-

650
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
All right.

651
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
You say your piece also.

652
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Okay.

653
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,400
Anyway, I think, yeah, to a degree, it's gotten a little bit crazy, but you know, those like

654
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,200
how the shows used to be back in the day and I think it's kind of fun to let loose and

655
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:59,800
be kind of silly once in a while because really ratings state other than what you just said.

656
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,480
However, you know, I like to keep it a bit more in line and finding the balance is kind

657
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,920
of hard, but sometimes you do have to let loose and be a little bit silly sometimes.

658
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,680
You know, everybody needs a change, a little break.

659
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,400
Change is good for you.

660
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,200
Maybe you know, maybe you need to be silly more often.

661
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,800
You're one of those people who seems to me that your energy is rooted in your root chakra,

662
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
which is the first one.

663
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
Oh, Jesus Christ.

664
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
All right.

665
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Look, look.

666
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I want to say my piece.

667
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
You know, I agree with what you're saying.

668
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,240
It's about balance and the trick is that we have to find the right balance on this program

669
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,480
between, you know, too crazy and too, you know, too much hardcore games because honestly,

670
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,140
you know, there's like 300 video game podcasts out there.

671
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,120
You know, granted, just because we were one of the first ones out there doesn't mean that,

672
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,840
you know, people will automatically, you know, tune into us because we were one of the first.

673
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,920
We have to compete with, you know, 300 podcasts, everything from other independent podcasts

674
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,280
to corporate podcasts, although I don't see the other independent podcasts really as competition.

675
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,280
So I actually want to say thank you to the emailer in a strange way because the other

676
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,960
podcast he says he's going to go listen to instead are at least both independent podcasts

677
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,840
that are, you know, just fine shows.

678
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,520
There wasn't an instead there.

679
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,880
Well, whatever.

680
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,280
Anyway, so regardless, you know, but it's interesting because for me, I know I've listened

681
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,440
to one of those shows before and they kind of have an off-topicness of their own.

682
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
That's not a bad thing.

683
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,820
I think you have to have a personal touch.

684
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,800
That's what makes all these shows unique.

685
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,720
So you know, we're still trying to find the balance in a way.

686
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,200
Yeah, I was a little crazy the past couple of weeks, but you know, it was fun.

687
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,800
I think what makes me happy about this one though is that he cared enough to tell us.

688
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
That's true.

689
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,680
And I mean, that to me just seems like is, you know, hey, I want you guys to do better,

690
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
you know.

691
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,640
So I mean, if that's the case, that's sort of the vibe I was getting.

692
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,160
So I hope that's the case.

693
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Dude, I hope you're still listening.

694
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,680
I'm sorry for picking on you.

695
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:52,480
I pick on everybody out of love, but you know, honestly, that helps us do better.

696
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:00,880
So if you give us, if you stick with us, keep giving us that chance, you know, we'll cry.

697
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,320
I think you'll find again, the goal of the show is to be like friends sitting around

698
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,560
the dinner table talking smack about games and sometimes it's going to be on topic and

699
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,000
sometimes it's going to get a little crazy, but you know, keep in mind we do it for free.

700
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,840
Sometimes the craziness is what keeps us going.

701
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,240
I know I had a lot of fun the past two shows, so we'll see what happens.

702
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,880
I hear now I realize this portion is pre-taped, but I hear Rice Princess is going to be back

703
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
tonight.

704
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
So we're going to have to really rein her in.

705
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
Stay somewhat on topic.

706
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
Yeah, I'm not going to be here.

707
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
I'll be eating cake.

708
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Well, have fun.

709
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,480
Bring me back some cake.

710
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Is it ice cream cake?

711
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
I don't know.

712
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
It's for grandpa.

713
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,960
Cake the video game?

714
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Cake the band?

715
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
So next email.

716
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Yes.

717
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Next email.

718
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
From AZHP.

719
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Hey guys.

720
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Hey.

721
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,320
I just wanted to comment on your story last week about PS3's price drop.

722
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,380
David Cracker actually came out and said that the Japanese financial division was talking

723
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,720
about price reduction, not price cut.

724
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Okay.

725
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,900
He claimed in an interview with IGN or OneUp or someone that they were looking at ways

726
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,680
to make the PS3 cheaper to produce, but would not pass the savings on to the consumers.

727
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,060
Now do you guys think this is a wise decision?

728
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,040
Would they make more money by keeping the same price, but having a cheaper cost of production?

729
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,840
Would they benefit from having a larger install base with a price cut to get more software

730
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
sales?

731
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,880
It just feels like Sony of America doesn't even know what Sony Japan is doing or thinking.

732
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,240
They're all just winging it.

733
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,560
I love the PS2 even though I'm on my third one because they keep breaking, but they just

734
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,320
keep doing the wrong thing at the wrong time with the PS3 and PSP.

735
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,120
What's going on?

736
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,180
Oh, you know, I would rather pay more for a quality product.

737
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,360
That's my thought.

738
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,000
That's actually sort of why I like my first generation Japanese PS2 because even though

739
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,920
they had parts that were a little bit faster, they were a little bit better made in terms

740
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:58,560
of their sturdiness, so it's business.

741
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,400
They're always wanting to make things cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and not change the

742
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
price.

743
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,240
They want to make it transparent to the buyer.

744
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,080
You're not going to know the difference unless you take it apart and look at what they did

745
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,640
and compare it side by side.

746
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,240
Well, it's funny we talk about balance because I think that's what Sony is having to find

747
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,440
is a balance here between their cost and the cost to produce the system and how much they're

748
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
going to charge people.

749
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,040
That's a very fine line and obviously they took a big gamble when they charged a lot

750
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,800
for their system and some say that gamble may not be paying off.

751
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,520
Is it in their best interest to pass along this savings cost to the consumer?

752
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
I think so.

753
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,200
I think that if they are going to save money on the systems, they need to pass along that

754
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,200
savings to the consumer in some way, but in the end, keep in mind Sony is losing a lot

755
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,000
of money on the consoles still.

756
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,360
The average Blu-ray player is still $1,000 standalone, not in PS3.

757
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,920
You know they're taking a pretty big hit on these systems.

758
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,400
Granted, Sony doesn't want to keep taking such a big hit so they do want to cut corners,

759
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
but again, it's about a balance.

760
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,680
If they can maybe save $100 on a system, pass along $50 of that savings to me, at least

761
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,280
it will be the illusion of, hey, the price is falling even though they're going to actually

762
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,680
gain a little more money if that makes sense.

763
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:16,240
I hate to keep comparing things to my massage therapy, but actually a lot of what they talk

764
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,080
about in the business aspect of that is that when you're trying to get clients in, in this

765
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,000
case comparing it with new buyers, you make an introductory price.

766
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,760
You make a special, you know, get your PS3 at the sale date, maybe like a corporate sponsored

767
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,180
sale, they get a bajillion buyers, you know what I mean, they get more people purchasing

768
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,240
it and then have it be at the regular price, they can say, oh, well, this is a good product,

769
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,600
it's really worthwhile for you to buy it, and then other people will come back, and

770
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,480
that's, you know, I think how you do it.

771
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
All right.

772
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
I hope you're listening, Sony.

773
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,680
Sony never listens to us.

774
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,980
Kasarai just needs a massage.

775
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,120
He needs Jamie to touch his chakra.

776
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Not by me.

777
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,880
I'm sorry, there's people I...

778
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Give him a happy ending.

779
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,080
Rob Hart.

780
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,840
Okay, this one comes from Twist.

781
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,040
I think Twist is a new writer, too.

782
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Hi, Twist.

783
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Hi, Twist.

784
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
I think that you're awesome.

785
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Anyway, hey, OLR.

786
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,840
A few things I want to write about today.

787
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,640
First off, I was at GameStop today, I'm so sorry, and there were two Sony men there.

788
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,600
Sony, big capital letters.

789
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,520
I guess they were just checking on their PS3 demo setup or something.

790
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,760
The assistant manager there, a friend of mine, was talking to one of them and asked when

791
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,840
the U.S. will see any white PSPs.

792
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,020
The man explained it probably wouldn't happen.

793
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,160
They watched Nintendo sell their multicolored systems and learned a little from it.

794
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,440
Owning every colored system seems to be a trend in Japan and not America.

795
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,180
Also, if a white PSP were to be released and someone who wanted a white PSP went to a store

796
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,720
to buy one and they only had black ones available, they would leave the store and not buy any

797
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
PSP.

798
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,840
They would therefore be losing out on a PSP sale.

799
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,760
Those were the excuses he gave.

800
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,080
Second thing I saw interesting was the sudden interest my girlfriend has in video games.

801
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,120
A few of my friends and I went to a local Super Smash Bros. tournament and my girlfriend

802
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
tagged along.

803
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,680
Afterwards, my friend apologized for exposing her to the nerds and the boringness and said

804
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,000
she had a blast just watching and couldn't wait to go to the next tourney.

805
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,240
She then grew a sudden interest in Smash Bros. and other fighting games I play.

806
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,160
We've been dating for only two months so I didn't think she liked video games much.

807
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,680
And instantly the sex stopped.

808
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,680
She later explained she used to hate video games.

809
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,380
She would get mad at her little brother all the time when they were younger and her father

810
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,260
would chase him off the TV when he would be playing.

811
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,440
So why the sudden interest I asked?

812
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,120
She figured out that she hated them maybe because her brother never let her play and

813
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
no one ever taught her.

814
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:46,720
So I thought maybe every girl is a potential gamer but can't express it because of game-hogging

815
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
brothers.

816
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,960
I don't know, I used to just kick my brothers off and play myself.

817
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,860
Last thing, Evolution Fighting Game Tournament, evo2k.com.

818
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,860
You guys should check it out.

819
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,180
It's a great experience.

820
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,960
People here take fighting games to a whole other level.

821
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,680
You guys have the Bimani community.

822
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,720
I have the fighting game community, lol.

823
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
That's all.

824
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Love the show.

825
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Keep it up.

826
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,420
No matter how off topic the show goes, it's always great.

827
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,560
You know, the fighting game community, they're some pretty hardcore people.

828
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,480
You know, I don't follow that scene a whole lot because I suck at fighting games but yeah,

829
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
it's pretty hardcore there.

830
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,500
I like Smash Bros. though but I suck at it.

831
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,800
There's just a funny story.

832
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,880
There's a guy who's well known in the cosplay community now named Chris, Chris Tang.

833
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,440
A long time ago when we first met him, he worked for Capcom and brought his own joystick

834
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,000
over to our house and proceeded to be on like a level 5 difficulty while Dan was at like

835
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
a 1 difficulty and Dan actually beat him around and he said that that was the most fun he's

836
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,900
ever had playing because someone actually managed to beat him.

837
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,800
So losing once in a while isn't so bad?

838
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,520
If you beat everybody that's around you, then...

839
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,360
That's why I kind of, you know, I love fighting games but there are people who get way too

840
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,080
into it who get too good for the game to be enjoyable I think.

841
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,600
Have I told my Street Fighter 2 chick story on this air once?

842
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,520
One time I was in L.A. and I was on like a trip and it was when I was younger, probably

843
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,640
about 17 and we were at a comic book shop late one night.

844
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,340
It was like after closing but for some reason a bunch of people were still there.

845
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,040
There are all these hardcore Street Fighter 2 people playing and I walked in, I didn't

846
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,360
know much about the game and I was playing Chun-Li and I kicked all their asses.

847
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,400
I did.

848
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,740
But the thing is that I probably beat like 8 of them in a row and they were getting pissed

849
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
like who is this guy?

850
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,740
What the hell is he doing?

851
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,840
You know it's probably because I was doing some new, I was some new blood and they all

852
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,800
knew each other's techniques probably so they kicked my ass.

853
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,900
Well finally, you know when I went down?

854
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,760
When some girl walked in and she also picked Chun-Li, she schooled me.

855
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,640
So if you ever have some chick that's trying to play that innocent thing like, oh what's

856
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,120
that controller?

857
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Let me try.

858
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,360
I want to play this game.

859
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,240
You're in for an ass kicking because she's probably just doing that.

860
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,000
I loved doing that when I lived in Alabama.

861
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Did I ever tell you the Tekken story?

862
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm sure you have but if you want to say it again real quick.

863
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,280
Well there were these guys who had been in there all morning playing with King, nobody

864
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,640
but King, learning all the throws and everything, playing each other.

865
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,240
So I went in there and picked Julia who on Tekken, Julia and Jin both have moves that

866
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,300
block throws and so I was just using them over and over again and managed to piss them

867
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:28,880
off so badly that they left all of their credits in the machine and left and I of course took

868
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,880
advantage of it.

869
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm not going to let any credits go to waste.

870
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Very nice.

871
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I love being a girl gamer.

872
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,200
I think we completely got off topic of that email but oh well.

873
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,000
That's what happens when you email us.

874
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,640
This one comes from Radink.

875
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
I guess it's also pronounced.

876
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
Hey, OLR.

877
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Love the show.

878
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm curious as to what the closing song of the show was.

879
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,880
Is I, Future List by Kiryamoka, fame producer of the Silent Hill series.

880
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,160
Uber email.

881
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,720
Okay, this is from McFloyd.

882
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
This is a great email.

883
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Dear OLR crew, I haven't emailed in a while so I thought it was about time I did speaking

884
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,080
of emailing whatever happened to the letter of the week.

885
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,000
Did it just phase out because I haven't heard one being announced for a while?

886
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,880
The only reason I think about it is because my first email was the letter of the week

887
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,160
and I was ecstatic about it and I haven't heard much since then.

888
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
You know what?

889
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,160
It's been, okay, I know this is hardly an excuse but I have been horrendously busy.

890
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,320
Well, also just we haven't gotten a lot of Uber emails lately.

891
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Yours is it.

892
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
Congratulations.

893
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
You're a second time winner.

894
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,240
Well, we don't get a lot of Uber emails.

895
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,280
I think the idea behind the letter of the week was for the Uber emails that were just

896
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,160
like too long to read on air, we would have them just be the letter of the week and everybody

897
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,160
could go read them on their own time but we haven't gotten a lot of those lately.

898
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
You know what?

899
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
This one's it.

900
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,920
It's the longest email we've received by default you in.

901
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,480
No, but actually it's a really good email.

902
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,640
I'm going to finish reading it.

903
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
Okay.

904
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,760
I'm finding more and more that graphics really do affect what I think of a system.

905
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,360
I love my Xbox 360 because it has games like Gears of War and I'm very excited about the

906
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,800
effects in Halo 3 from what I've been reading on the Bungie website.

907
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,320
Although I don't know if I'll be buying a PS3, it still really impresses me as everything

908
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,960
looks so realistic.

909
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,600
If Sony made some better decisions and the price went down a bit, I might even consider

910
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,520
getting the PS3 mainly because it has the processing power to make major games perform

911
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,240
well and possibly to make the dashboard or whatever it's called on the PS3 very sleek,

912
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:27,800
easy to navigate, and a simple place to put music, pictures, movies, et cetera.

913
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,760
In a few years, I would see the PS3 and Xbox 360 as good game consoles but I'm worried

914
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,080
about the Wii.

915
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,480
It doesn't have the power to play games that will make people gasp in admiration or the

916
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,240
space right off the bat to store large amounts of information.

917
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,080
It has the graphics of the game generation that was supposed to last five years and it's

918
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,120
supposed to last for a generation that could be even longer.

919
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,160
The controller is innovative, there's no doubt, but games like Katamari Damacy pulled

920
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,120
off innovation with regular PS2 controller and peripherals can always be made.

921
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,320
Software like the Wii channels could very easily be copied by Sony or Microsoft and

922
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,320
maybe even improved.

923
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,640
So why haven't they done it?

924
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,800
What are your opinions?

925
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,440
How do you think the Wii will last this generation?

926
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,240
I think, again, it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.

927
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,240
A system is only as good as the games that are on it and on the Wii, you have Wii Sports,

928
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,680
Zelda Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, and on the PlayStation 3, you have Mobile Suit

929
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,120
Gundam, Sonic the Hedgehog.

930
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:34,680
Granted, you have Resistance but Resistance is Resistance $600 plus $60.

931
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,720
Let me give the PS3 benefit of the doubt, $500 plus $60 plus whatever the component

932
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,200
cable costs to make the game look good.

933
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
Is it worth that?

934
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,520
Is it that good?

935
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,060
I say no.

936
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,320
For the average gamer, no.

937
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,720
Whereas the Wii, again, the Wii is going towards a different audience than you, the hardcore

938
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
gamer.

939
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,080
They're accomplishing their goal very beautifully, I think.

940
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,360
Honestly, I know a lot of people.

941
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,880
We had Marissa in here last week.

942
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,760
I've had other people I know that don't really play a lot of games or haven't played a lot

943
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
since Cape It Nintendo.

944
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,240
Grandparents are playing the Wii.

945
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,320
Even outside the grandparents, because I think a lot of the anti-Nintendo crowd says, oh,

946
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,080
well, a grandma may play Wii bowling, but does that mean she goes out and buys a Wii?

947
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,640
I don't know, but that means that grandma's going to think about that for her kids.

948
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:31,560
Actually, I was at Target a couple of days ago and saw this lady, probably in her early

949
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,720
60s, buying a Wii.

950
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,720
We were in line together.

951
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,560
I asked her, I was like, so this is for your grandkids?

952
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,800
She's like, no, it's for me.

953
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,280
You know, I don't want to come off sounding like a Nintendo fanboy.

954
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,400
To be fair, Sony has the potential.

955
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
You're right.

956
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
This guy's right.

957
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,820
The system's got a lot of processing power.

958
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,820
It's got a lot of potential, but at the same time, so does the Wii.

959
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,240
We know Nintendo always keeps secrets about systems.

960
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,960
They don't show off until later.

961
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,000
The Wii really, truly has not gone online yet.

962
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,440
I think they will, despite the whole friend code thing.

963
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,260
I just have this feeling that once you really sit down and play Animal Crossing with Wii

964
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,800
Connect 24, it's going to be a different type of experience all its own.

965
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,000
In the meantime, I still think Microsoft will always be the king of gaming, online gaming

966
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
in this case.

967
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I don't know.

968
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We'll see.

969
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
We'll see.

970
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's just too early.

971
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,900
I mean, wake me up when Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy 13 are out.

972
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,480
Then I can really assess the PlayStation 3, but right now, it's a pretty box with nothing

973
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,120
inside it.

974
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,120
That's how I feel.

975
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,480
Actually, mine's dusty now.

976
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,480
If I were to show-

977
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,240
It's a shiny, dusty collector.

978
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:45,160
If I were to show my mom resistance, she might go, well, it's nice looking, but if I were

979
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,080
to show my mom Wii Sports, she'd go, whoa, you're like up and you're moving.

980
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,120
It's just that you just swing it.

981
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,240
You don't have to hit a button.

982
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,040
That's all you do?

983
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,360
That's the difference between Nintendo and this generation and everything, despite what's

984
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
in the box.

985
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,740
Anyway, that's my ramblin' thought.

986
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,400
There's one other issue that's been bothering me.

987
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,960
The way people rate games, I find it disturbing, and this doesn't just relate to video games,

988
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,160
that sex is as much a bigger deal than violence for the ratings as it's a much worse thing.

989
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,740
For those who really understand what violence does, I suppose it's okay that violence is

990
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,420
so prominent in video games, but when little kids grow up seeing in movies and games that

991
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,640
violence is not such a big deal and sex is awkward or wrong, or when people do it they're

992
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,480
somehow breaking the rules, it definitely sets them on the wrong path for looking at

993
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,480
life.

994
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,140
I think that as long as games and shows are separated from reality, it's okay, but when

995
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,200
kids are becoming saturated with these ideas coming from them from all directions, it's

996
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,800
hard for parents to give them the right information when the media controls their kids' minds.

997
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,840
My point with all this is that you have to give the parents a break because entertainment,

998
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,160
video games included, is affecting children, and there will always be friends with systems

999
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,520
to play your TVs to watch, even parents try their hardest to stop it.

1000
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,980
That would require an impossible amount of patience and strength to first extract what

1001
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,920
a child has seen on TV and then put everything in context for them.

1002
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,400
Parents don't often have the courage to teach children so much about life early on, so I

1003
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,780
don't believe it's necessarily their fault if kids grow up desensitized and messed up.

1004
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,040
The media has become crueler and more vicious.

1005
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,360
Yeah, I can see it from that angle, I do understand that, but I think that it's just a matter

1006
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:25,600
of actually, you know, you phrased it beautifully, parents don't often have the courage to teach

1007
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,080
their children about life early on.

1008
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:35,280
You know, I think that if they started off educating their children, you know, that would

1009
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,720
avoid a lot of the problems, say, you know, make sure that if their child's going to see

1010
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:46,160
something that they understand, and actually I have a very good relation to this, I was

1011
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,640
actually just watching the second, an evening with Kevin Smith last night, he was talking

1012
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,640
about his daughter.

1013
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,360
He says he doesn't, they don't hide language around around their daughter, that they curse

1014
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:03,720
all they want to, and, you know, and she basically has gotten to where she doesn't want to do

1015
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,720
it just because she hears it, you know, it's not a big deal to her.

1016
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,980
You know, it's just like, well, you know, when you're dieting, if you can have all the

1017
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,360
chocolate cake you want, chocolate cake doesn't become special anymore, you won't want it

1018
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,580
as much.

1019
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:24,000
You know, I think that if you, not necessarily a blatant exposure of a violent element to

1020
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,920
a child, but if you explain it how it is and say, you know, this is what goes on, this

1021
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,720
is, you know, why people do this, this is what happens, if a child doesn't have to figure

1022
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,600
it out for themselves, because their logic, they're not fully developed, their logic is

1023
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,840
not all there.

1024
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:45,680
If you say, hey, you know, this happens, this is what goes on, they're going to be in a

1025
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,120
better position to assimilate what they're seeing.

1026
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,000
It's very interesting you bring up that point, because I kind of, one other little thing,

1027
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,720
I don't know if I was maybe mishearing or misreading into this letter, but I'm also

1028
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,320
hearing that, you know, the society and the parents have a way bigger problem with sex

1029
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,560
and games than they do with violence and games, and that's just American culture in general.

1030
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,660
I mean, you're not just talking about video games there, it is movies, it is TV, sex is

1031
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,880
always looked at way harsher than violence.

1032
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,640
I mean, seriously, a movie says the F word twice and it gets rated R, but, you know,

1033
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,720
you can blow up limbs and heads and, you know, sometimes you can still get away with a PG-13,

1034
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,480
yet we have this real problem with underage sex in this country.

1035
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,480
Interesting, hmm?

1036
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,060
I don't know, you kind of apply what you're saying there and when it's taboo, people want

1037
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,060
to do it.

1038
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:38,680
I bet if mom and dad talked more about them having sex in front of the kids, the kids

1039
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,760
would never want to have sex ever.

1040
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,760
I'm joking.

1041
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,280
I'm not a parent, I don't know.

1042
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,680
Just something that I have more information that I've taken from my classes.

1043
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:56,020
One of my teachers said that the reason why there's also a lot of unhealthiness in people

1044
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,600
is because they have an unhealthy attitude toward their bodies.

1045
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:06,860
You know, with us having this, you know, anorexic, waif-looking image on TV when all it is is

1046
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:12,580
freakin' photoshopping and unhealthiness, when you're driven to be productive, when

1047
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,920
all that's doing is raising your adrenaline, making your liver, you're dumping adrenaline

1048
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,520
into your liver, which is shortening your lifespan in general.

1049
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,820
You're not breathing properly, but also, you know, there's this whole attitude that sex

1050
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,480
is something that you don't discuss.

1051
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,880
It's something that you keep hidden, where it's offended.

1052
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,560
I'm willing to discuss sex on this program any time.

1053
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:40,680
Well, and you know, there's some people who don't need it so much.

1054
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,920
You know, I'm not going to...

1055
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,680
There's some people I know that do need it, because, you know, oh boy.

1056
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:53,160
It really, but it is, I think, you know, it is, I think, an important part of your overall

1057
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,160
well-being.

1058
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,020
It's a balance that it creates, and when we treat it like it's a disease, when we treat

1059
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:05,000
it like it's something that's disgusting, that's foul and immoral, you really take something

1060
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,160
that's very healthy for you and treat it.

1061
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:17,400
It's like having the cure for cancer and thinking that it's, and treating it illegal.

1062
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,920
All the emails have this balance theme going on tonight.

1063
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,000
I fully believe in balance.

1064
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,960
I think it's a good thing, but you know, it's just that whole, that's, you know, I hate

1065
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,800
to go off on the tangent like that, but that's my view toward how America views sex, because

1066
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,820
if you go to a lot of other countries where people just can you go around topless or,

1067
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:39,340
you know, where nudity is on TV and no one treats it like a big deal, look at their rate

1068
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,760
of sex crimes, you know.

1069
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,560
I'm going to start a trend right here.

1070
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,520
I'm going to go around topless in studio right now.

1071
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,520
You know what, Rob?

1072
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:53,520
I can't, but it's, you know, if you take a look at it, we have such a high rate of sex

1073
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:01,160
crime because I think it's because we do treat it like it's, like it's a disease.

1074
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,720
Your thoughts are always welcomed out there.

1075
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Mail back to orangeslauncheted.com.

1076
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,440
I'm sorry for going off on it, but you know, it's, it's, it's actually something that's

1077
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,200
been sort of sitting on my head for a while because I really noticed it, you know, and

1078
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,840
the video can be another symptom of it.

1079
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,020
You know, the whole hot coffee thing is like, dude, why?

1080
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,040
It's got an M rating anyway, didn't it?

1081
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
I believe so.

1082
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,040
Yeah.

1083
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,440
I should have said it should have been AO, but that's R versus NC 17, but anyway, whatever.

1084
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,280
So the last, the last phrase here, and by the way, Loki got pwned.

1085
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,580
He was so confident about the Halo 3 release in spring, yet on the Bungie website, a picture

1086
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:37,240
had the ad campaign came out and the bottom fall, 2007 was written boldly and clearly.

1087
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,240
I guess no one's perfect, but he was still wrong.

1088
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,440
Okay, that's all bye.

1089
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,520
Listen to last week, part A, I called him on it.

1090
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,620
He has, he has some good reasoning though.

1091
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,240
So listen, take a, take a listen.

1092
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,240
P.S.

1093
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,520
Since the Wii is seventh generation and the Xbox 360 is second generation for Microsoft,

1094
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:55,920
the term for Wii and 360 owners should actually be Wii 69.

1095
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,320
I'm not sure how that math came about, but all right.

1096
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,320
Okay.

1097
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,320
We'll take it.

1098
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,320
We have one from Lee.

1099
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,320
Hi, Lee.

1100
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,440
Who was apparently writing us from London.

1101
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,080
Well, hello.

1102
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,760
Hi, you guys.

1103
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,760
Cheerio.

1104
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,000
Would you like to sit down and have some tea and crumpets?

1105
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,640
Hey, I got an email complimenting me on the British accent, by the way, to my personal

1106
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,640
email box.

1107
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,640
Really?

1108
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,640
Yes.

1109
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,640
Have I?

1110
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,640
I don't know.

1111
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,640
Let's not.

1112
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,640
We're running long.

1113
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,640
Let's get.

1114
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,920
One thing I really like about being from Alabama, if you, if you look up, the Southern accent

1115
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,920
is actually derived.

1116
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,920
Balance, Jamie.

1117
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,920
Balance.

1118
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,920
I am going to talk about it.

1119
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,560
The Southern accent is actually derived from the West England type, you know, region of

1120
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,560
accent.

1121
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Did you read that on Wikipedia?

1122
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,160
No, I didn't.

1123
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,600
I actually took a linguistics class.

1124
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,600
All right.

1125
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,600
All right.

1126
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,600
I'll talk to you though.

1127
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,600
Anyway.

1128
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,600
Back to the email.

1129
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,600
Hi, you guys.

1130
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,560
Just wanted to comment on your marketing strategy.

1131
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,160
Rob suggested at the end of your last show that all listeners go out and let one person

1132
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,160
know about OLR.

1133
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,040
I think this may be an unnecessarily slow process and hamper your efforts at world media

1134
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,040
domination.

1135
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,040
If my maths is correct, and it most likely isn't, if all your listeners were to head

1136
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,000
out and let two people know about OLR every week, and then the following week they all

1137
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,280
in turn let two more people know, in about 30 weeks the entire population of the planet

1138
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,240
would be listening to your show.

1139
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,660
In your new position as world famous personalities, you could use the power of gaming to eradicate

1140
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,400
world poverty, cure the common cold, and create a new utopian society.

1141
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Dude, utopian.

1142
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,960
I love that word.

1143
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,320
Just a suggestion though.

1144
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,320
Cheers, Lee.

1145
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,720
Lee, Lee, Lee.

1146
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,560
Lee is the new marketing manager of Orange Lounge Radio.

1147
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
I like the way you think, Lee.

1148
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,560
Welcome aboard, Lee.

1149
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,560
Welcome aboard.

1150
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,400
Send me a plane ticket, please.

1151
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,120
I like the way this man thinks.

1152
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,920
Therefore, at the end of the show, I will from now, I will be encouraging everyone to

1153
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,280
tell two people that now they have to tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio.

1154
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,880
And you can all thank Lee for that.

1155
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,880
I like the way he thinks.

1156
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,000
That was brilliant.

1157
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Last email.

1158
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yay.

1159
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,320
Which is going to segment, or segue I should say, into another segment.

1160
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,320
All right.

1161
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,320
Oh.

1162
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,320
Play my music, Rob.

1163
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,320
Sure thing.

1164
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:23,680
The website of the week, combined with this email from our friend, ApolloChon, good morning.

1165
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,880
One of my friends, another listener, linked me to this site a few days ago, and I thought

1166
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,880
it was cute.

1167
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,640
Perhaps it could be a website of the week, or something of the sort.

1168
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,080
It at least deserves an honorable mention.

1169
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,080
Objection.

1170
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,120
Which we have discussed on the site before.

1171
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,960
I have seen previous user-made objections, so this is good.

1172
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,600
It's about time we named this the site of the week.

1173
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
However, it's about time.

1174
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:56,720
So it's objection.mrdictionary.net.php, and we actually have one submitted in this email.

1175
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,160
So you actually had an objection put in the email.

1176
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,320
Yep, and it's loading the text right now.

1177
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,320
Okay.

1178
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,320
Okay.

1179
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:10,520
Clearly, Dark Sakura should choose objection as the website of the week.

1180
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:16,320
Evidence shows that it is 99% amazing.

1181
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,680
I'd like to know what type of evidence that is, but all right.

1182
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,680
We'll take it.

1183
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,080
That sounds like one of my live channel entries to you.

1184
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,080
Anyway, that'll do it for both the website of the week and for emails.

1185
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,080
Keep them coming, y'all.

1186
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,080
All right.

1187
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,460
Any closing words you want to say to the listeners at home, Dark Sakura, before we vanish you

1188
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,720
into what's current and live on the show right now?

1189
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,160
I didn't say what I was playing this week.

1190
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,160
All right.

1191
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Well, quickly tell us about your gaming week.

1192
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,160
I played World of Warcraft.

1193
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,160
Yeah?

1194
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,400
Thanks to my dear best friend, Chris.

1195
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,720
I am playing again.

1196
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,760
I don't have Burning Crusade yet because, well, I have to pay $300 at the end of March

1197
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,360
and $500 to buy a massage table in April, so I'm kind of broke.

1198
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,360
However, I played my first human.

1199
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,500
I played a warlock, and I hate kobolds.

1200
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,040
What server are you on?

1201
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,040
Ravencrest.

1202
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
Ravencrest?

1203
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,040
Oh, the server.

1204
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,040
We all play it.

1205
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,040
Wait a minute.

1206
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,040
I was trying to say Ravenloft.

1207
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,040
Wait, Ravencrest, but you're a human.

1208
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,040
Yes.

1209
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,040
What's your character's name?

1210
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,040
I'm not telling you.

1211
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,040
Oh, you can't say it on air.

1212
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,040
Can you whisper it to me?

1213
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,040
Can you mouth it?

1214
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,040
Why?

1215
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,040
Because you're going to hunt me down.

1216
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,040
Yes, I'm a horde, so I'm going to hunt you down.

1217
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,000
I'm going to kill you for making a character on the wrong side for the Horde.

1218
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,200
I'm going to make a horde too, but my character's name is Lorcan, which if anybody ever reads

1219
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:35,280
Anne Rice novels before she went stupid, it was a character in one of her last books,

1220
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,060
one of her pre-stupidity books.

1221
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,880
My character's name is posted, but if you want to know it, you have to go check the

1222
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,880
forums.

1223
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,880
Orangenotrader.com.

1224
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Forums.

1225
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,000
My other characters are on Suramar.

1226
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I have a night elf on Suramar.

1227
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,760
And then on Airy Peak, I have an undead.

1228
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,600
Airy Peak is so 2006.

1229
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,840
Well, my characters, I'm just glad they weren't deleted, because I didn't play for seven months.

1230
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,880
And then they're still there.

1231
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:12,280
And by the way, just an honorable mention, Misty has sent us 20,000 emails from her phone.

1232
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,680
You can email, like mailbag getorangenotrader on your phone?

1233
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,680
I can do that too.

1234
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,680
Interesting.

1235
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,680
But I like this one.

1236
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,480
Hey, I miss you guys a lot.

1237
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,600
I'm just going to go ahead and get a brand new computer once my tax money gets here.

1238
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,600
Misty's funny.

1239
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,440
She sends me a lot of random AOL messages too, but it's cool.

1240
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,440
They make me chuckle.

1241
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,580
Dude, it's the doctor.

1242
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,380
On that note, we better go back to the present time.

1243
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,580
So quickly, your final thought.

1244
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:44,200
Anybody in the Sacramento, Roseville, Citrus Heights area, in April I will be a licensed

1245
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:48,160
massage therapist and my rates are $75 an hour for me to come to your house and give

1246
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,820
you the best massage ever.

1247
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:55,040
Is this the Orange Ontario video game show or the massage show, because I'm starting

1248
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,040
to wonder.

1249
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,800
Will you massage people while they play video games, maybe?

1250
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:06,000
I will do a special video game massage where I play the Final Fantasy Celtic Moon soundtrack

1251
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
while rubbing your feet.

1252
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
All right.

1253
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
We got to go back.

1254
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,640
So, Dark Sakura, have a lovely week off and take care.

1255
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,640
Okay.

1256
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,640
All right.

1257
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,840
Through the magic of the space time continuum, that was Dark Sakura.

1258
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,400
Thank you very much, Dark Sakura.

1259
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,960
We miss you here live in the studio tonight, but our aim is improving.

1260
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,960
I will have you know.

1261
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,960
So it's very nice.

1262
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,960
All right.

1263
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,960
Well, let's get back into some news.

1264
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,640
We got some news for you guys and this is kind of interesting.

1265
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,640
Did you hear about this, Eddie?

1266
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,640
I don't know.

1267
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,120
Did you see the list that GamesRadar posted of the five game characters with one foot

1268
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,120
in the closet?

1269
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,880
I did not, but I'd love to hear it.

1270
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,360
You might want to turn on that mic.

1271
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,880
I did not, but I'd love to hear it.

1272
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,220
Well, I don't know if I want to really read the whole list, but basically it was a bit

1273
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,640
of a controversial article.

1274
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:52,800
They said Kratos from God of War, Marcus Fenix from Gears of War, Frank West from Dead Rising

1275
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,400
and Vaan from Final Fantasy XII.

1276
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,400
That's true.

1277
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,980
But what's interesting is kind of the way they went about saying it is they used a lot

1278
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:08,160
of gay stereotypes, like so and so is cross dresses, so he must be gay because he looks

1279
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,920
like a chick, so he must be gay.

1280
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
That's stupid.

1281
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,920
That's pretty dumb.

1282
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,680
And what's interesting is it caught the radar of Gay.com, which is not a gaming site.

1283
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,680
It's a gay site.

1284
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,060
It caught the radar of Gay.com's UK edition as well as another site, Pink News.

1285
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:26,400
And they publicly yelled at these games' radar articles.

1286
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,800
Pink News said, quote, what is the point of outing characters?

1287
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,920
Is this yet another bunch of childish straight boys laughing at gay people?

1288
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,460
And the author of the Gay.com article was elaborating that the article had a very facetious

1289
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:44,800
tone to it and basically was making jokes about the LGBT community.

1290
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,320
And I guess because they pegged Frank West as being gay because he dresses up in women's

1291
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:53,080
clothes and children's clothes for a bit of carnal experimentation.

1292
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:58,760
Yeah, I mean, gamer guys are, the subculture.

1293
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,280
Not the ones that listen to this show.

1294
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,660
I mean, we're all cool, but the subculture, like in general, does seem to be kind of homophobic.

1295
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,920
That's the tone.

1296
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,820
I think anyway, I mean, like you said, like the guys that make the games with like boobs

1297
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:14,440
and stuff, you know, which is like every game, you know, yeah, I can see that where they'd

1298
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,800
be like kind of homophobic.

1299
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,560
They make hot guys too.

1300
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:22,080
Have you never played any of the Castlevania games, where the hell have you been?

1301
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,520
I mean, it's like, what is that one game that came out, God Hand?

1302
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,200
I mean, it's like, that game is like pretty ripping on gay people and like, like I haven't

1303
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,200
seen this game.

1304
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,960
Yeah, the God Hand, it's for PS2.

1305
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,600
I mean, the game looks pretty good, but it's like, it's pretty over the top, like just

1306
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,600
porn for like 14 year old straight guys.

1307
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,820
Like you can like spank, but only the female characters and like there's these like really

1308
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,940
flaming like gay villains.

1309
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:49,640
The whole game is supposed to be, it's a parody on like Kung Fu games or whatever.

1310
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:53,680
It's, it's like a Kung Fu hustle, the game is basically what it's supposed to be.

1311
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,680
Yeah.

1312
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,400
But like in every trailer they show like the spank attack, you know, and the, but you could

1313
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,120
only spank the female villains.

1314
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,120
Like they didn't program it.

1315
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,120
You could just spank anyone.

1316
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,080
So the, I don't know, that's pretty like one sided to me.

1317
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,080
Interesting.

1318
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,080
I don't know.

1319
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,400
I read the original list, the games radar posted, I just thought it was stupid.

1320
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,800
Like it was like, it's like when someone tells a joke and no one laughs and believe me, I

1321
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,240
know that feeling very well here on this program.

1322
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,840
You know, that's kind of like what I felt this guy's article was, is that like, like

1323
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,440
some genius on one of these board meetings was said, Hey, let's do an article on like

1324
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,960
gay guys in video games.

1325
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,520
And I don't think it was meant maliciously.

1326
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,640
So I don't get my feathers ruffled about it.

1327
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,840
Like I just look at it and go, wow, that's just stupid.

1328
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
Yeah.

1329
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,000
I don't get offended about it.

1330
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,320
I just go, okay dude.

1331
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,320
Right.

1332
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,320
Sure dude.

1333
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,320
Dude.

1334
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,320
Yeah.

1335
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,320
Sure dude.

1336
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,880
I think Gears of War is totally gay.

1337
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,880
Yeah.

1338
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:46,880
You got it.

1339
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,880
Yeah.

1340
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,240
Cause he, you know, thinking about his buddies too much and all that.

1341
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,600
And Kratos is totally gay because he doesn't like bang two chicks at the same time in two

1342
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,600
different games.

1343
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,600
Uh huh.

1344
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,600
Uh huh.

1345
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,600
And he doesn't wipe his ass with tree bark.

1346
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,280
I mean, where was Makoto on the list?

1347
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,720
Like that's the reason I didn't take the list.

1348
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,720
Well, I guess maybe because it was about closeted game characters, whereas Makoto in enchanted

1349
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,280
arms was a, you know, he was a, he was a very, if I ever saw one in the cosmos.

1350
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,280
Yeah.

1351
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,160
Or with his ginormous package.

1352
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,920
Or where is King, the biggest lesbian in all of video games?

1353
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,920
Oh my God.

1354
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,920
She's totally a lesbian.

1355
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,920
Yeah.

1356
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,920
I'm kind of with you guys.

1357
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,920
She's like one of my favorite characters.

1358
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,920
I don't really care.

1359
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,920
Yeah.

1360
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,920
I don't really care.

1361
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,920
I mean, whoa.

1362
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,200
You know, it's like, I just, you know, I want there to be a game where you spank guys.

1363
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,360
You like, you like Sims type games where you can just do whatever you want.

1364
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,360
Yeah.

1365
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,360
Pretty much.

1366
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,360
Yeah.

1367
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,720
As long as they let me do stuff to guys in the games.

1368
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,720
Only willy ones, of course.

1369
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,720
Yeah.

1370
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,720
Well, yeah, no.

1371
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,720
Yeah.

1372
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,720
Of course.

1373
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,720
I mean, geez.

1374
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,720
Come on now.

1375
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,720
Uh-huh.

1376
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,720
Come on.

1377
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,720
You guys are gay.

1378
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,720
Uh, let's see.

1379
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,240
James Patrick says, uh, God ham, the main character is gay, right?

1380
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,240
Or becomes gay.

1381
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,760
That's what the X-Play video seemed to suggest.

1382
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,760
Yeah.

1383
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,760
Of course.

1384
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,760
That's a lot of things.

1385
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,280
A lot of X-Play videos suggest gay themes for games and that's, that's kind of what

1386
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,640
this article struck me as.

1387
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,200
It was like an X-Play review.

1388
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,760
Like it's trying like way too hard to be funny, but I just don't laugh.

1389
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,040
That's what it is.

1390
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,040
Yep.

1391
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,040
All right.

1392
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,040
So, that's it.

1393
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,480
I don't have my feathers ruffled over it.

1394
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,640
I just kind of go, game's radar is wearing enough egg on their face over it.

1395
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,680
I don't need to be able to sit here, oh, it's homophobic and blah, blah, blah.

1396
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,680
No, it wasn't.

1397
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,680
It was just stupid.

1398
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,680
There's a difference.

1399
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,200
There's a difference between homophobia and stupid.

1400
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,560
Nobody really cares about you guys, so.

1401
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,560
Yeah.

1402
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:36,440
So, every month it seems to be that there is a story out there about somebody killing

1403
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,200
somebody and somehow they're tying it into violent video games and that was the case

1404
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,120
also with a Milwaukee murder.

1405
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:52,680
Fifteen-year-old Nathan Moore was a murderer of Rex Bomb, an alcoholic transient, and apparently

1406
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,400
this Nathan Moore was quoted saying it was just like a violent video game.

1407
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,640
You know, killing the guy reminded him of a violent video game.

1408
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:06,160
So, of course everyone went, ah, it's games to blame and stuff like that.

1409
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:15,440
Um, the one, the stepmom of Nathan actually was a dedicated Penny Arcade reader and she

1410
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,560
actually wrote him a letter regarding the whole thing and it's actually quite interesting

1411
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:25,040
because they talk about how, you know, the kid is just kind of just crazy, doesn't, you

1412
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,800
know, getting in trouble in every which way and, you know, doesn't, she basically points

1413
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:35,000
out it's not the game, not video games fault and it did not make him who he was.

1414
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,800
He was already fucked up to begin with, so, um, I do think it's kind of interesting though

1415
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:45,040
at least there's someone out there that's willing to say, hey, this is not the case.

1416
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,920
Um, and I believe someone pointed out, I can't remember where it was, but they pointed out

1417
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,160
that, you know, he may be crazy, but he's not stupid.

1418
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:59,360
He knows that he can get like some sort of like crazy, um, insanity plea with, you know,

1419
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:03,000
saying that, oh, video games made me do it type of thing.

1420
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,880
So I think he's just trying to use that, you know, kind of to get off a little bit.

1421
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:13,680
I don't know, but get off, get off from being, you know, I love, we can always count on the

1422
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,360
serious perspective from rice princess.

1423
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,360
Do you have any serious thoughts on this?

1424
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,360
Yeah.

1425
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,360
That was it.

1426
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,360
I farted.

1427
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,360
Yeah.

1428
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:28,360
Everybody's saying goodbye to rice princess folks, she won't be back last week.

1429
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,960
Um, anybody have any comments on that?

1430
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,160
I do.

1431
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:41,140
Moving right along then, you guys are assholes, um, Microsoft has been caught in a lawsuit

1432
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:48,680
and a federal jury ordered Microsoft to pay $1.5 billion, uh, to the, uh, telecom group

1433
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:55,240
Actel Lucent, no Alcatel, Alcatel, like Alcatel Lucent, uh, for violating two patents related

1434
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,240
to digital music.

1435
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,080
Basically it all has to do with MP3 encoding and decoding, uh, and that has to do with

1436
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,080
Windows media player.

1437
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,560
They're going, what the hell does this have to do with gaming?

1438
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:08,320
Well, uh, it's because a part of this suit has to do with speech coding and video coding

1439
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:13,600
used in the Xbox 360, which makes you go, Hmm, will future Microsoft's products be hampered

1440
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,720
by this?

1441
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,040
Or is this just a case of a jury wanting to get back at Microsoft because you know, they're

1442
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,560
evil or whatever it is.

1443
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,360
I think that they're just going to pay this and unlike, you know, Sony, they're actually

1444
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:28,480
going to, you know, pay for the rights or whatever that they may have infringed on and

1445
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,120
just license them.

1446
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,520
I think they do that actually for the rumble technology.

1447
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,600
They license the rumbling patents or whatever, although some companies decide to remove them

1448
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,180
altogether because they don't want to shell out money.

1449
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,180
But whatever.

1450
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:50,280
So, um, you know, on a completely different topic though, um, you got to love the Russians

1451
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:55,800
and they came up with this wonder, you know, and this is like a, such a horrible stereotype,

1452
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:03,600
but um, they've come up with a Russian, a massively multiplayer online drinking game.

1453
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,280
Oh my God, that's awesome.

1454
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:12,720
And apparently it's, um, you would take this special shot glass that will plug into your

1455
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,840
computer via USB.

1456
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,400
And when you logged into a special chat room, the glass keeps track of how much alcohol

1457
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,680
you have left just to make sure that you're keeping up.

1458
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:25,240
Um, so that, I don't know.

1459
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,280
If I put water in it.

1460
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,160
Well, I suppose you could.

1461
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,160
Ha!

1462
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,160
I fooled the computer.

1463
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,800
Well, aren't you elite hacker?

1464
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,360
I hack sword your shot glass.

1465
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,800
With water.

1466
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:44,200
Or can't you just like pour it out into another cup or, you know, like there's tons of different

1467
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,200
ways you could hack into it.

1468
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,040
Or how does it all, give it all to Irene because she's poor and can't afford it.

1469
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,960
Well, could you just go on one of those adult sites and put up a picture of somebody else?

1470
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,320
I mean, that's about the same.

1471
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:57,320
Or can't you just like drink at home, like with your friends and not have to do it on

1472
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,440
the computer with a bunch of people you don't know?

1473
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,720
Like, that's pretty sad.

1474
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,440
This sounds to be, to be honest, this sounds like something that they would have in like

1475
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,440
Second Life.

1476
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:12,000
Uh, Cane VM says, uh, in our chat room again, chat.orangehelter.com, Cane VM says, MMO drinking?

1477
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Hell yeah.

1478
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,640
Black Boy says, that game sounds awesome.

1479
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,800
Uh, Blaze says, innocent people will die over this game.

1480
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,840
And GS68 says, you'll die of water intoxication.

1481
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,840
That's true.

1482
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,840
That's Sacramento.

1483
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,640
And, uh, apparently people like to do that here.

1484
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,640
Oh God.

1485
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,640
Um.

1486
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,640
What?

1487
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,640
It's true.

1488
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,640
Too soon.

1489
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,640
Too soon.

1490
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,640
Don't give me that.

1491
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,640
Okay.

1492
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,640
Yeah.

1493
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,360
You know, all those people that made those comments were like under 21 and like, oh my

1494
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,360
God, he's so cool.

1495
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,360
He's drinking game.

1496
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,840
I don't think Black Boy, what Black Boy participates in, uh, uh, I know they call it Free Play

1497
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:48,040
Friday, but I call it Drunken Orgy over at All Games on Fridays.

1498
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,040
So I think he's over 21.

1499
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,040
Oh man.

1500
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,040
They have Drunken Orgies?

1501
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,680
Uh, we got to pick up the slack here.

1502
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,680
This is Zippy Orgies.

1503
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

1504
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,360
Oh, it is, it is, uh, the end of February sweeps.

1505
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,480
How are we going to top that on the All Games Network?

1506
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,480
We need to be pulling some ice cream.

1507
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,000
We're going to murder someone live on here.

1508
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I know.

1509
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
All right.

1510
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Bye Rob.

1511
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And you wondered why Lanky Style came back.

1512
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
All right.

1513
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Lanky Style, just put this plastic bag on your head and I got a rubber band.

1514
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I'm, I can't.

1515
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Too soon.

1516
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Too soon.

1517
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I love you.

1518
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Hearts to you.

1519
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
He's really acknowledging me.

1520
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I know how we can, I know how we can pull through the sweeps.

1521
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,040
Oh man, our ratings are number one.

1522
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:31,080
Um, so anyway, let's go back to, all right, well, no, I know exactly how we can pull through

1523
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,080
for sweeps.

1524
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,080
Are you okay?

1525
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,080
Lanky Style?

1526
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,080
I didn't, I didn't mean it.

1527
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,520
An apology to Lanky Style?

1528
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,520
I think he's giving me poundy face.

1529
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,040
It's like unsubscribe, unsubscribe right there.

1530
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,040
All right.

1531
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,040
Anyway.

1532
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,040
Don't misrepresent me.

1533
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,040
What?

1534
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,040
I said, don't misrepresent me.

1535
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,040
At least I probably got you to talk.

1536
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,040
Fuck.

1537
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,040
All right.

1538
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,040
You're mean now, Rob.

1539
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,040
I know.

1540
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,040
I'm, I'm a jerk.

1541
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,040
All right.

1542
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,040
Let's see.

1543
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,080
I'm looking at chat room.

1544
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,720
Black Boy says, did anyone see the photo of me teabagging stalker Oscar?

1545
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,520
See look, we're going to lose sweeps, you guys, we're going to fucking lose.

1546
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,520
Oh man.

1547
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,520
Against this.

1548
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,520
Come on.

1549
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,520
Teabagging?

1550
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,520
That's it.

1551
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,520
I got to, that's it.

1552
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,520
I'm going to have to go and teabag rice princess right now.

1553
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,520
Get the hell away from me.

1554
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,520
He's really walking towards me.

1555
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,520
Bend over.

1556
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,520
Ah.

1557
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,520
Ah.

1558
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,520
No.

1559
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,520
All right.

1560
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,520
Got a face full of crotch.

1561
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,520
How much do I owe you?

1562
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,080
Well, it's a nice segment, which is a great sweeps trick.

1563
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,840
It's playing a good old fashioned game here on Orange Lounge Radio and we have a game

1564
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,840
called Beat the Host.

1565
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,600
And we asked to qualify our question earlier in chat and that was which board does Pac-Man

1566
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,840
crash on?

1567
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,360
And we have our winner on the line.

1568
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,720
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1569
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,720
You there?

1570
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,720
Hey, how's it going?

1571
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,800
Hey, who is this?

1572
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,900
It's the Rob D. Rob D, what board does Pac-Man crash on?

1573
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:41,900
256.

1574
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,900
Right.

1575
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:47,360
The 256th board is when half of it glitches, but apparently you can actually still get

1576
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:52,720
past it but you have to you have to be super human basically a few memorizer

1577
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,400
thing it supposedly is possible and there is a way to have the ramen get

1578
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,560
around that make it normal I think but I know that's that's going to Wikipedia so

1579
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,440
I don't know too much about it alright good job you and I got the answer the

1580
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,440

I do know this one, but I forget what it is, so I'm going to pass on that.

1634
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:27,920
All right.

1635
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,920
Fifteen.

1636
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:29,920
Master us.

1637
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,920
Five, no.

1638
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:31,920
Four.

1639
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,920
Three.

1640
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:33,920
Pass.

1641
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,920
Two.

1642
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,920
One.

1643
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,920
Make the point.

1644
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,480
This is a tough category tonight.

1645
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,760
Our chat room is even struggling at times.

1646
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,400
But you did get two right and that may be enough to beat Loki.

1647
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:48,320
I don't know, my classic arcade game knowledge is a little limited on that one, fortunately,

1648
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,480
but good luck, Loki.

1649
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,480
All right.

1650
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,480
Well, here we go.

1651
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,480
We're going to bring Loki back in studio.

1652
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,720
If Lanky style would please go grab Loki.

1653
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,720
How was Lanky style doing?

1654
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,200
He actually got a few of them, yeah.

1655
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,800
He would have been a very formidable opponent.

1656
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,800
All right.

1657
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,200
Well, it's a good thing Rob D didn't pick him.

1658
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,200
Yeah.

1659
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,200
I'm glad he picked a total loser like Loki.

1660
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,200
Hi, Lanky.

1661
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,200
How you doing?

1662
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:09,200
Loki's wearing the wedding shirt that Jamie and I got him, the one that says Game Over.

1663
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:13,400
Yes. Alright, well I can't tell you what Rob D got just yet, but

1664
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,600
we'll see, it's a tough category. Anyway, I need you to look that way. Alright,

1665
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,240
and you're going to name off, because I don't want him to see what songs are on screen. So here we go.

1666
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,800
Again, just say pass. If you want to pass, you have two minutes, and your two minutes

1667
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,800
starts right now.

1668
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:35,800
Bubble Wobble. Yes.

1669
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:44,800
Pass.

1670
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:58,800
Dig Dug. No. Mr. Do. No. Burger Time. Yes.

1671
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,800
Pass.

1672
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:15,800
Pass.

1673
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:29,800
Contra. No. Pass. Pass.

1674
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,800
Dig Dug. Yes.

1675
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,800
Pass.

1676
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,800
45 seconds.

1677
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,800
Pass.

1678
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:02,800
30 seconds. Pass. In fact, the one you passed the first time.

1679
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:11,800
1942. No. Time travel. No.

1680
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,800
19 seconds.

1681
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:28,800
8, 7, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. All done.

1682
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,800
Alright, let's add it up. Let's see how you guys did.

1683
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,800
Rob D got two right, but Loki got three right. Loki, you win.

1684
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,800
You know, a lot of them I recognized, and I was like, I couldn't play them.

1685
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,800
It was really hard tonight. Chadron was doing very well, though. Rob D, I'm so sorry you didn't win.

1686
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,800
That happens. Good job, Loki. Alright, better luck next time, though. You want to hear the right answers, though?

1687
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,800
I bet you want to know them, because this is the party. Ah, yes I do. Ah, dammit.

1688
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,800
Are we allowed to guess them? Were Tempest and Bubble Wobble in there?

1689
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,800
Ah, yes, they both were. What were you thinking, Rice Princess?

1690
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
Are we allowed to guess them as you go on? Sure, why not?

1691
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,800
Okay, so just play them. We didn't cheat, though, because the names are up on the screen.

1692
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,800
No, I can't even see from there. Okay, good. Here we go.

1693
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,800
What do you think, Rice Princess? Well, this is Bubble Wobble. Loki guessed that one.

1694
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,800
What do you think this one is?

1695
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,800
Robotron? No. Oh.

1696
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,800
I have no fucking clue. Tempest, that's one.

1697
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,800
Alright, somebody got this. This is for her time.

1698
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,800
We both got that, actually.

1699
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,800
Yeah, I've got no clue. No idea?

1700
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,800
Nope. Even, I think if I let it go in here a little bit more, it'll be here.

1701
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
Hold on.

1702
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,800
I think it's right here. You might recognize this.

1703
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,800
You remember that? Crystal Castles! Crystal Castles.

1704
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,800
Oh, yeah. Alright, this is Frogger.

1705
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,800
And that's Frogger.

1706
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,800
This one's a real toughie. I don't know if anyone got this right.

1707
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,800
This song's so familiar.

1708
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,800
1943. 1943. Oh, God.

1709
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,800
Dig Dug. This one's Dig Dug. Somebody got that one right? Dig Dug?

1710
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,800
This is a tough one. I think somebody in the studio said it, though.

1711
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,800
This could be Zaxxon. It is a Zaxxon. Damn it!

1712
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,800
Zaxxon. Good job. This one's one of my favorites.

1713
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,800
I'll give you a hint, because in the balls of penguins, Sega made.

1714
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,800
Push cubes around and squish little blobs.

1715
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,800
Tango! Tango!

1716
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:46,800
Okay, this one is a killer. I don't know if anyone got this one. I wasn't watching chat.

1717
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,800
Namco made.

1718
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,800
In most of their selections of games.

1719
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,800
Knights of the Round? Nope.

1720
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
Sword game.

1721
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,800
Incredibly slow-moving character.

1722
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,800
The Tower of Druaga. The Tower of Druaga was the last one.

1723
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,800
I know. I'm like, what? I said it was a killer.

1724
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,800
There it was. Your ten songs. Bubble Bobble. Tempest. Burger Time. Crystal Castles. Frogger.

1725
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,800
1943. Dig Dug. Zaxxon. Pengo. Tower of Druaga.

1726
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,800
That was a killer, but Rob D., you made a good showing, and we appreciate your participation.

1727
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,800
All right. Thanks for taking my call, and thanks for letting me participate.

1728
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,800
As a consolation prize, a lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni.

1729
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,800
All right. Sounds great.

1730
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,800
All right. Have a good one.

1731
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,800
San Francisco treat. I know. I'll see you guys later.

1732
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,800
All right. Later, buddy.

1733
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,800
Rice Princess-A-Roni.

1734
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,800
Rice Princess-A-Roni?

1735
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,800
Yeah, sure.

1736
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,800
All right. There you go.

1737
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,800
All right.

1738
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:41,800
Dark Tetsuya said he would have gotten five, and he knew the Tower of Druaga.

1739
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,800
Looks like some folks knew Pengo. That was very good.

1740
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,800
You know, Zaxxon sounded so familiar, and then I just had to think about it for a little bit.

1741
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,800
I'm like, aw, crap.

1742
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,800
That was a tough one, because I knew...

1743
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,800
And by the way, I pulled all those games off GameTap earlier today,

1744
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,800
because they have a bunch of those games,

1745
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,800
and it's really easy for me to dump when the game is on the computer, the audio.

1746
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:04,800
And when I picked Zaxxon at first, I was like, oh, it'll be easy to recognize.

1747
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,800
And like I was playing, I was like, this is really hard.

1748
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,800
Maybe I should switch it out, but no, I kept it in there.

1749
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,800
But the Tower of Druaga, man, that's killer.

1750
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,800
That was freaking killer.

1751
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,800
Really cool. You should do old PC games or something like that,

1752
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,800
because no one would get that stuff.

1753
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,800
All right. Rob D. and Chad, he's back in Chad and yelling,

1754
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,800
I'm pissed at myself for not knowing Tempest and Dig Dug.

1755
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,800
I purposely put in some Xbox ones there, like Frogger and Dig Dug.

1756
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,800
So there you have it.

1757
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,800
We hope you enjoy Beat the Host.

1758
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,800
How did you guys do? Would you have gotten all ten?

1759
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,800
Would you have beat Loki? Only you know.

1760
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,800
Be honest, no cheating on your honor.

1761
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,800
All right, we've got a couple more gaming news stories for you guys,

1762
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,800
and then we're going to get back into the phones,

1763
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,800
take a couple more phone calls before we say good night.

1764
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,800
And speaking of music, because we just played a game about video game music,

1765
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,800
who doesn't love Koji Kondo, if you know who he is anyway?

1766
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,800
He's the author.

1767
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,800
Zelda.

1768
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,800
Yeah, he made Legend of Zelda music, Star Fox, Mario.

1769
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,800
I mean, the guy's a legend, right?

1770
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,800
Well, he is going to be performing at Video Games Live

1771
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,800
this year in San Francisco.

1772
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,800
That's March 9th at 8 p.m.

1773
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,800
That's the show during the Game Developers Conference,

1774
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,800
which I may or may not be going to.

1775
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,800
I'm still trying to work out some last-minute details.

1776
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,800
I'm hoping to go to the Game Developers Conference

1777
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,800
with the All Games crew, but we'll see.

1778
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,800
Yeah, they did something like that in Japan,

1779
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,800
where they actually had an orchestral concert of all the Nintendo music.

1780
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,800
I guess there's words to the Epona song from Ocarina of Time

1781
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,800
that this woman was opera singing.

1782
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,800
It was pretty crazy.

1783
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,800
There you go.

1784
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,800
I really want to go just to see this.

1785
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,800
I think it would be great.

1786
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,800
A lot of the songs they play at a Video Games Live,

1787
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,800
I don't know if I get, but I think it would be really cool.

1788
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,800
I did not get into some of the LucasArts games like a lot of people did.

1789
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,800
I do love Loom and Monkey Island, some of that stuff,

1790
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,800
but apparently they're going to have some LucasArts stuff,

1791
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,800
and apparently there's going to be a Contra presentation,

1792
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,800
which should be interesting.

1793
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,800
But when I think about Contra, I don't think about the music.

1794
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,800
Does it just mean?

1795
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,800
I don't know.

1796
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,800
Some of the last games were pretty heavy metal,

1797
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,800
which would be kind of cool to see for formula.

1798
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,800
Oh yeah, Kira. That would be awesome.

1799
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,800
All right.

1800
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,800
Well, I guess we've got one more story for you guys tonight,

1801
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,800
and then we're going to open up the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR.

1802
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:16,800
So the big story is Itagaki is working on something new

1803
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,800
and something that doesn't have to do with boobies apparently.

1804
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,800
Is it Day Rape?

1805
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,800
No, it's not Day Rape.

1806
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,800
He got it.

1807
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
But here's the thing, though.

1808
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,800
Everyone's thinking this is going to be a big thing,

1809
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,800
but he did everybody party or every party or whatever,

1810
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,800
so he has done different things.

1811
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,800
So he's working on a new project that's not going to be DOA related.

1812
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,800
He says, I'll be announcing such a game in the new future,

1813
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,800
the title of the game aside.

1814
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,800
It's like no other type of game I've ever made.

1815
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,800
Hooray.

1816
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:53,800
So I will have news about an amazing game soon.

1817
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,800
Why?

1818
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,800
We're back to that again.

1819
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,800
Did you see me in Almond Joy here?

1820
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,800
Oh, yay.

1821
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,800
Oh, sorry.

1822
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:00,800
We're on the air.

1823
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,800
I love Almond Joy.

1824
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,800
Coconut.

1825
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,800
Dude, almonds.

1826
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,800
Or as my dad would say, Ammon Joy.

1827
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:06,800
Oh, it's shaped like an egg.

1828
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:07,800
I can shove it up your ass.

1829
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,800
You'd probably like that.

1830
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,800
You have some ammons?

1831
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,800
Some ammons?

1832
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,800
That's what my dad's going to say.

1833
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,800
You like ammons?

1834
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,800
Ammons are crunchy?

1835
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,800
You know they have a big ammon factory in downtown Sacramento.

1836
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,800
Oh, yeah?

1837
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,800
Diamond.

1838
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,800
Have you ever driven by it?

1839
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,800
Video game.

1840
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,800
Oh, yeah.

1841
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,800
Oh, yeah.

1842
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,800
We're on a video game show.

1843
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,800
Well, I guess we should let some callers call in and direct the show otherwise.

1844
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:27,800
1877 Game OLR.

1845
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,800
There's always our Skype line username, OrangeLawnTradio.

1846
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:35,800
There's more information on our website, www.orangelawntradio.com, by clicking on interact with us.

1847
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:36,800
Let's go to the phones.

1848
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,800
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnTradio.

1849
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:38,800
Who's this?

1850
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,800
Raven's Dolphin.

1851
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:40,800
Hi, Raven's Dolphin.

1852
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
Oh, I got time to eat my egg here.

1853
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,800
You like Almond Joys?

1854
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,800
I love Almond Joys.

1855
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,800
I know.

1856
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,800
It's good stuff.

1857
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:47,800
All right.

1858
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,800
What's on your mind, buddy?

1859
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
I was waiting for you to get to my call all night.

1860
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,800
I was so excited to tell you that I knew that you pulled it off GameTab.

1861
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,800
Nine out of the ten games are on GameTab.

1862
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,800
Ten out of the ten games are on GameTab.

1863
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:00,800
Really?

1864
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,800
I just didn't want it to sound like, you know, I don't know, that they were like, they paid

1865
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,800
us off to be.

1866
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,800
No, I did it from GameTab because it's easy that way, to be honest.

1867
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,800
And they do have a lot of classic games on there.

1868
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,800
I like GameTab, especially Abe Lincoln Must Die.

1869
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,800
I haven't even played that.

1870
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,800
What the hell is that?

1871
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:18,800
That sounds awesome.

1872
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,800
That's the new Sam and Max episode.

1873
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,800
Oh, no, I need to play the Sam and Max games.

1874
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,800
If you played Sam and Max, you would know, does the carpet match the drapes?

1875
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,800
I don't want to know the answer to that.

1876
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,800
I seriously need to ban myself from World of Warcraft for a week so I can play some

1877
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,800
of these computer games I've been missing.

1878
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,800
Have you checked out Missed Online?

1879
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,800
I haven't gotten missed through, but I heard it's great.

1880
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,800
I want to.

1881
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,800
Are you a fan of Missed?

1882
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:44,800
Eddie?

1883
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,800
I'm a huge fan of Missed.

1884
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,800
I love Missed.

1885
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:48,800
It's awesome.

1886
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,800
And, yeah, it's cool.

1887
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,800
I'm surprised you don't know about Missed Online then.

1888
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,800
It just opened up on Valentine's Day.

1889
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,800
I know.

1890
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,800
Eddie has this, like, Christmas little boy face on right now.

1891
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:01,800
Well, yeah, because I'm like probably the only person who still likes point-and-click

1892
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,800
games where I'm like, oh, I missed.

1893
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,800
Click games?

1894
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,800
Point-and-click.

1895
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,800
All right.

1896
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,800
Ravenstaufen, one more question.

1897
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,800
What else are on your mind tonight?

1898
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,800
I got a phone to pick with Loki.

1899
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,800
All right.

1900
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,800
Loki, Ravenstaufen's going to pick your bones.

1901
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,800
Ew.

1902
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:18,800
All right.

1903
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,800
What's on your mind?

1904
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,800
Loki, you said about 15-inch television.

1905
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:28,800
I own a 50-inch television and I'm not gay, and you said go buy a PC monitor.

1906
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,800
I don't have money.

1907
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,800
My mom said, here, have this 15-inch HDTV monitor.

1908
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,800
Wouldn't you like it for games?

1909
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,800
And I said, yes.

1910
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,800
When in the hell did he say that 15-inch monitors made you gay?

1911
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,800
I don't even remember saying that.

1912
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,800
I never said that.

1913
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:49,800
Oh, when you were on all games on Monday, you must have said it.

1914
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:50,800
I don't even remember saying that.

1915
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:51,800
You know what?

1916
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,800
Scott totally sets us up to say mean things so we get angry listeners.

1917
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,800
No, I think what I was saying, I think what I was saying, I can't remember.

1918
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,800
I swear to God, every time I've been on that program, he tries to get me to talk about

1919
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,800
another podcast.

1920
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:08,800
Someone had a 15-inch LCD TV or whatever and they spent, I forget how much money on it,

1921
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,800
and I said, well, you should just go buy a fucking monitor because they're a lot cheaper

1922
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:20,800
and you can get a 19-inch or even a 21-inch or whatever and you can do HD on a PC monitor,

1923
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:25,800
so just spend the money on that instead.

1924
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:26,800
Yeah.

1925
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,800
All right, well, there.

1926
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,800
I never said gay, though, ever in that argument.

1927
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,800
I said retarded but not gay.

1928
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,800
I was improv-ing.

1929
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,800
All right.

1930
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:37,800
What else?

1931
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,800
One more thing.

1932
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,800
It's always one more thing.

1933
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,800
All right.

1934
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,800
It's your trademark, though.

1935
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,800
You know?

1936
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:44,800
Yeah.

1937
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,800
You should have.

1938
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,800
Do you have a Myspace Ravenstaufen?

1939
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,800
Yes, I do.

1940
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,800
Okay, yeah.

1941
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,800
I was going to say, you need to get one and put a little picture of yourself on there

1942
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,800
with little text underneath it that says, one more thing, and you should have a little

1943
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,800
picture of you going with the hand.

1944
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,800
One.

1945
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:58,800
Of course.

1946
01:30:58,800 --> 01:30:59,800
All right.

1947
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:00,800
Forget it.

1948
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,800
What's your one more thing?

1949
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,800
My headset is orange for Orange Lounge Radio.

1950
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,800
Aww.

1951
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,800
I just threw up in my mouth.

1952
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,800
All right.

1953
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:10,800
Thanks, Ravenstaufen.

1954
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:11,800
You're cool.

1955
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,800
You too.

1956
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,800
Bye.

1957
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,800
All right.

1958
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,800
Take care.

1959
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,800
Bye.

1960
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,800
Let's go to another phone call.

1961
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,800
What was that?

1962
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,800
What the hell did I do there?

1963
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,800
I have no idea.

1964
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,800
I'm eagerly anticipating chicken shoot.

1965
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,800
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1966
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,800
Who's this?

1967
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,800
Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.

1968
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,800
Hi, Paradox Vincent.

1969
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:29,800
What's on your mind?

1970
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,800
Not much.

1971
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,800
Not much?

1972
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,800
Well, what the hell are you calling us for tonight?

1973
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,800
What do you want to talk to us about?

1974
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:54,800
I just think that on the Best Buy story, did that cover the internal, the whole scandal

1975
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,800
on their big internal internet, the external internet website?

1976
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,800
No, we did not cover that story.

1977
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:03,800
What the hell is this about?

1978
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:06,800
So the Best Buy, their internal is the external site?

1979
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,800
What's this about?

1980
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:14,800
Well, basically, I've heard that they'll offer sales on their external website, which

1981
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:21,800
you can access from their home, and they'll say, oh, well, there's a sale on this, so

1982
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:28,800
I want to go pick it up, this camera that's been discounted down to 130.

1983
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,800
But then you go into the store and they won't let you have it.

1984
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,800
Yeah, and then they say, oh, that sale ended at seven plus time, and you said, well, I

1985
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:38,800
checked the website.

1986
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,800
And they say, oh, the website must have been responding slowly.

1987
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:46,800
Let's go check this one in store, and then they'll go check it and show you, see where

1988
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,800
it ended at this date.

1989
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,800
And I just think that too.

1990
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:57,800
Well, to be fair paradox, Vincent, there's a lot of stores that do the online only deals,

1991
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:01,800
like I've shopped at circuitcity.com, and I believe that's the site.

1992
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,800
Please don't quote me on this, but I believe that's the site that won't show you what the

1993
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,800
sale price is until you put it in your cart.

1994
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,800
And then you have Walmart and Target both sell things on their website that they don't

1995
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,800
even sell in the store.

1996
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,800
The reason why they don't show you that price on there is because sometimes they will have

1997
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,800
an agreement with the publisher or whoever that they have a minimum advertised price,

1998
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:26,800
which they cannot advertise a price lower than that, or in other words, they won't get

1999
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,800
their co-op dollars to advertise.

2000
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,800
They get paid by these companies to advertise their products.

2001
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:35,800
I am surprised, though, that Best Buy does not do price matching, because a lot of companies

2002
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:40,800
will do price matching, where if you can bring in an ad from a competitor, they'll match

2003
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,800
the price.

2004
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,800
And I would think the Best Buy ought to be able to match itself.

2005
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,800
And a lot of times Best Buy does retarded, though, because I went in for a camera that

2006
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:54,800
was marked down and priced a couple hundred dollars, and they said they didn't have it,

2007
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,800
but they were retarded because it was actually last year's model that it was marked down.

2008
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,800
They had it in a shelf.

2009
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,800
They had to actually open up a cabinet to get this thing out.

2010
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,800
So, it might be just retarded for an employee.

2011
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,800
I don't even think that they say that it's an online-only sale.

2012
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:19,800
I really don't think that it is an online-only sale, and I just think that's really too shady

2013
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:20,800
for anything.

2014
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:21,800
Is it shady?

2015
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:22,800
Yes.

2016
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,800
Is it illegal?

2017
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:24,800
No.

2018
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,800
So, there's really not a lot we can do about it but take our dollars elsewhere.

2019
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:35,800
Yeah, and I'm also really excited about the gold testing in Naperville, because I'm really

2020
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:41,800
hoping that means they'll bring it out here and that the arcade in Arizona will get gold,

2021
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,800
because it seriously needs an upgrade from that.

2022
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,800
You know, again, he's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold.

2023
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:53,800
If you're a new listener to Orange Lounge, you don't know the Bimani music game scene.

2024
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:59,800
He's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold, which is basically the 14th release for Japan, the

2025
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,800
first one they're testing in the arcades here, although they did put the game out as Beatmania

2026
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,800
on U.S. consoles a while ago.

2027
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,800
Yeah, you know, I think the machine does insanely well, which it has the potential to do.

2028
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,800
I think you're going to have a lot of people driving in to play the machine from nearby

2029
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:13,800
areas.

2030
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,800
I think you're going to start seeing this.

2031
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,800
The only blockade is going to be the machine.

2032
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,800
It's still going to be one of the more expensive ones to purchase, but I think you're going

2033
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,800
to see arcades around the areas take the plunge.

2034
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,800
I'm sure the golf land chain, which is big on the West Coast, especially California,

2035
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,800
Arizona, I'm sure they'll take the plunge.

2036
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,800
They usually do with Bimani games.

2037
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,800
I really wish they do.

2038
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:38,800
I think that's what they might have been working on while they wanted to work on Beatmania

2039
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:39,800
U.S. 2.

2040
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,800
I think they might have, maybe?

2041
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,800
Maybe they said, what the hell are we doing two separate games for?

2042
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,800
Let's just make it the same.

2043
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,800
I say, it's about time.

2044
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,800
Yeah, I do think it's about time.

2045
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,800
All right.

2046
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,800
Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for the call.

2047
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:56,800
Take care, buddy.

2048
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,800
We'll see you next time, all right?

2049
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,800
All right.

2050
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:00,800
Later.

2051
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,800
Bye.

2052
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,800
That was the NOS Cross, so they will bring the game to you very soon.

2053
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,800
To all of us, because I would like to play 2DX Gold.

2054
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,800
I don't know about you.

2055
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,800
Lankystyle, you're a big fan of Beatmania 2DX, aren't you?

2056
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,800
I used to be.

2057
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:14,800
Did you hear about Beatmania 2DX Gold, testing over here in the U.S.?

2058
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:15,800
Nope.

2059
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:16,800
Oh.

2060
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,800
What's that?

2061
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:18,800
The 14th version.

2062
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,800
Why did you stop playing Beatmania 2DX?

2063
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,800
I've been doing other things.

2064
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,800
Like, masturbating?

2065
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,800
No.

2066
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,800
Okay.

2067
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:30,800
Like, writing a book?

2068
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,800
Yes.

2069
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,800
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2070
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:35,800
Whoa.

2071
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,800
Hey, sorry to call in again, but I do have a couple of comments to make about games.

2072
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,800
All right, well, Rob D., I suppose. As long as you're going to keep it on topic.

2073
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,800
But no talking about amanjoys or I'll have to hang up.

2074
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,800
I don't think you have to worry about that from me, but...

2075
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:49,800
All right.

2076
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:58,800
Okay, so, I don't know. You guys were talking about the Wii earlier and how it does have problems with games coming out

2077
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,800
and the lack of games for it, for that matter.

2078
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:04,800
I don't know. I think that all three consoles have trouble with games at this point.

2079
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,800
Actually, yeah, they do all have trouble with games in some way, shape, or form.

2080
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:10,800
The 360 has a lack of variety with its games.

2081
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,800
If you're an RPG fan, if you're a fighting game fan, if you're a platformer fan,

2082
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,800
I can't imagine you're too thrilled with the 360's game lineup.

2083
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,800
True, and you just said Rice Princess right there, right?

2084
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,800
Oh, my God, you're my hero.

2085
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,800
This is why you have never been a big Microsoft fan, correct?

2086
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,800
Pretty much, yeah.

2087
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,800
Are you going to change your mind on 360 anytime soon?

2088
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,800
No.

2089
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:30,800
Not even Blue Dragon?

2090
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,800
Nope.

2091
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,800
All right. Sorry, Rob, did you keep going?

2092
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,800
And then the Wii, obviously.

2093
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,800
It just came out, but it does have some trouble with games right now.

2094
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:40,800
I think a lot of third-party developers are unwilling to hop on the bandwagon

2095
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:46,800
or were unwilling to hop on the bandwagon because of the odd nature of the controller,

2096
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,800
and now I think by Christmas you'll see a lot more developers willing to give it a shot.

2097
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,800
Do you think maybe it's just the time of year?

2098
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,800
Because this is usually kind of a slow period for games.

2099
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:59,800
We don't see a lot of big games start really hitting until summer.

2100
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,800
Like come May, June, we'll start seeing more games in November.

2101
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,800
Whoa, big flood of games.

2102
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,800
Do you think maybe that's just part of it, why we feel a little bit robbed right now?

2103
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,800
No pun intended.

2104
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,800
Probably, but I think the E3 PowerPoint Expo in May will be very telling.

2105
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,800
The PowerPoint Expo.

2106
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:20,800
To see what people announce and see what people have for the Wii, the PS3, and the 360.

2107
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:29,800
I'm hearing that the E3 Elitism Expo is actually supposed to be now possibly all the way to October.

2108
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:32,800
Yeah, we'll see what happens with it. I honestly don't know that much about it yet.

2109
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,800
And I call it the Elitism Expo because only the most elite of the gaming media

2110
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,800
who has their mouths firmly on the cock of the various gaming companies out there

2111
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,800
will get an invite to this.

2112
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:45,800
And why didn't I get an invite?

2113
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,800
I actually might be going to the Elitism Expo because...

2114
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:53,800
Oh, really? Something you need to share with us here on the program.

2115
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,800
Well, because distribution is in a whole different category.

2116
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:01,800
Isn't it funny how no one's excited about E3 now?

2117
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,800
Oh, fuck E3. Who gives a shit?

2118
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,800
Well, there went our invite.

2119
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:08,800
Well, it's no longer a rock star show like it used to be.

2120
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:13,800
Actually, yeah, it's no longer a big show and rock star is never there anyway,

2121
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,800
so we wouldn't see Grand Theft Auto.

2122
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,800
Well, I meant rock stars and giant sound systems and that sort of thing.

2123
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,800
Look, last year when I got diverted walking around the booth because of Paris Hilton,

2124
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:30,800
I was pissed. I was so pissed. I was like, this show just makes me mad.

2125
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,800
Although I did have a great time.

2126
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,800
I did have a great time.

2127
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,800
I did have a great time. It was really fun to play all the new games and talk about them,

2128
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,800
but damn, Paris Hilton. I mean, man, fuck her.

2129
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:39,800
She's everywhere.

2130
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,800
Anything else, Rob?

2131
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,800
I don't know. I think this Christmas is going to be very interesting.

2132
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,800
I think the coming years are going to be very interesting

2133
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:49,800
because the console race is really wide open this year, well, this generation.

2134
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:50,800
What do you think?

2135
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,800
The established leaders' problems are well documented.

2136
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,800
Sony's got a lot of problems because they're trying to release a system

2137
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:04,800
that's an all-in-one media center for $600 when all they want is a game machine.

2138
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:09,800
We asked a lot of people in the program what the PS3 can do to get a bigger foot in the marketplace here

2139
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:13,800
and get some of their love back from all these PS2 loyalists because they'll tell you,

2140
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:16,800
I love my PlayStation 2, but I'm not so hot on the PlayStation 3.

2141
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,800
I'm going to ask you, what will Sony do, you think?

2142
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:24,800
I think we might see a price drop by this Christmas, honestly.

2143
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,800
I don't know how they're going to survive otherwise.

2144
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,800
I really don't. $600, $500.

2145
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:35,800
It's a lot easier to convince kids' parents or even to convince 20- to 30-year-olds

2146
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:40,800
or teenagers with jobs to get the 360, which is going to have a price drop.

2147
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,800
You know that by this Christmas.

2148
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:43,800
No question about that.

2149
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,800
They're well overdue for one.

2150
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,800
Or the Wii, which is $250.

2151
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:48,800
You know what, though?

2152
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:52,800
If worst comes to worst, though, you'll get your lame movie tie-in games that will sell like crazy.

2153
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,800
Wasn't Cars the biggest selling game last year?

2154
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,800
No.

2155
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:56,800
Or something?

2156
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:57,800
I don't know.

2157
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:58,800
It was some lame movie tie-in game.

2158
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,800
It was the highest selling game last year.

2159
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:05,800
There was Madden. Madden's always the big one.

2160
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,800
Movie tie-in stuff, I don't know.

2161
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:15,800
Cars did okay, but it came out back in June.

2162
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:20,800
Then the sales had already died by the time it came into Christmas.

2163
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,800
Zappi says Cars was number three, Madden was number one.

2164
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:29,800
I'm just saying, although there may not be a lot for us hardcore gamers,

2165
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:35,800
the casual gamers and the kiddies, they do have a really big pull in this market we often neglect

2166
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,800
when we're coming up with all these consensuses.

2167
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:44,800
Yeah, but yeah, it is Sony, so who knows if they'll actually have that price drop.

2168
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,800
We'll see. I hope so for their sake.

2169
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,800
Because otherwise I don't know how they're going to...

2170
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,800
Well, actually, again, the thing is we'll see where the Japanese developers go, too.

2171
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,800
The ones that make the platformers, the RPGs, the fighting games, because they're not too high on Microsoft.

2172
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,800
Well, at least they always have Ridge Racer.

2173
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,800
Exactly. And the eye of judgment.

2174
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,800
I know what they're going to do, Rob, to save themselves.

2175
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:09,800
Sony's going to include a copy of Rainbow Island with the system.

2176
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:10,800
That's a brilliant idea.

2177
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,800
I know.

2178
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:12,800
God, you should go work for Sony.

2179
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:13,800
I shouldn't.

2180
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,800
All right. Thank you, Rob, for the call.

2181
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,800
All right, thanks for taking me again.

2182
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:18,800
No problem. Have a good one.

2183
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,800
I don't think you're showing anymore.

2184
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,800
All right, no problem.

2185
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,800
See you guys later.

2186
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:22,800
Bye.

2187
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,800
We just kind of hit the answer button on whoever's on deck, but unfortunately we got to call it a night.

2188
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:28,800
We're running kind of long.

2189
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,800
We took a bunch of calls in part A. We've had a lot of people on the show tonight.

2190
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:33,800
Although we do appreciate all you guys calling in.

2191
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:34,800
We're sorry to those digging through.

2192
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,800
There were seriously like five people still hammering the line, so I'm so sorry to those of you guys.

2193
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,800
We'll try to get you guys next week.

2194
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:40,800
I'm sorry.

2195
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,800
Do you want to do one real quick?

2196
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,800
Yeah, sure, even though you just hung up on something.

2197
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,800
Real, real, real freaking quick.

2198
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:48,800
Okay, 60 seconds.

2199
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,800
Orange House Radio, who's this?

2200
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,800
Legend of Zaku.

2201
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:52,800
All right, Zaku, get it out.

2202
01:42:52,800 --> 01:43:01,800
Just the fact that it's my understanding that the PS3 is just going to become that sinking ship, the Titanic.

2203
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:02,800
Yes, it is.

2204
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,800
As some would call it.

2205
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:05,800
I'll never let go, Zaku.

2206
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:06,800
I'll never let go.

2207
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,800
Oh, please, yes.

2208
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,800
All right, this will go on.

2209
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:21,800
I'm just worried about, you know, honestly, you know, what I'm worried about right now is other games, you know, such as Crackdown, selling other things like, you know, for example, the Halo 3 Beta.

2210
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:33,800
I mean, seeing that Crackdown is a really good game, I don't know if, you know, the Halo 3, all that hype might actually, you know, help the series in the long term.

2211
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:41,800
Zaku, with the remaining 15 seconds, how can, I'll say, how can Sony get out of this mess minus the Final Fantasy 13?

2212
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,800
Metal Gear Solid 4, does that depend?

2213
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,800
Minus the two big ones.

2214
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:46,800
Everybody knows about those.

2215
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,800
Minus those two.

2216
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:51,800
They need to get more downloadable content, more downloadable games.

2217
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,800
Flow and Qbert, I think, are not cutting it right now.

2218
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,800
So they need that and just, you know.

2219
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,800
But what about Warlock?

2220
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:07,800
Oh, yeah, that too, but you have to also consider that it needs to compete with the likes of the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console.

2221
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:10,800
They need to get all their cards out just to be in the same footing.

2222
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,800
You know what, they need achievement points.

2223
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,800
That too.

2224
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:16,800
All right, Zaku, got to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

2225
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,800
All right.

2226
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:18,800
Later, buddy.

2227
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:19,800
All right.

2228
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:20,800
Bye.

2229
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,800
That's it.

2230
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:22,800
All right.

2231
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:23,800
I just feel bad for this one.

2232
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:25,800
Hi, who's this?

2233
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:26,800
It's Ron Rowe.

2234
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,800
You know, I'm still pissed that I was on a call coming up from a con while I missed an awesome show last week.

2235
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:32,800
I'm sorry to hear that.

2236
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:33,800
30 seconds.

2237
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,800
Quick, con review.

2238
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:36,800
Okay.

2239
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,800
Con was great.

2240
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:42,800
One of the guys in the chat, Mr. Wonderful, will be doing a complete con report for you guys in the chat by next week.

2241
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:48,800
Also, to reiterate for Best Buy, yes, they do price next, but the trick is there's got to be a local store in the area.

2242
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:49,800
How's that?

2243
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:50,800
That's beautiful.

2244
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:51,800
Thank you, Rama.

2245
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:52,800
Later.

2246
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,800
All our calls should be like that, seriously.

2247
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:55,800
Wow, he's like-

2248
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,800
Fucking in and out.

2249
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,800
He knows the sound of it.

2250
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:58,800
I know.

2251
01:44:58,800 --> 01:44:59,800
You just do that every time.

2252
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:00,800
Like, get it out.

2253
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:01,800
Beautiful.

2254
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:02,800
Whip it out now.

2255
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:03,800
30 seconds or die.

2256
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:04,800
That'd be beautiful.

2257
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:05,800
Okay.

2258
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:06,800
All right.

2259
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:07,800
I don't know what just happened there.

2260
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:13,800
But I do know it's time to ask if there's any last minute stories.

2261
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:14,800
Loki?

2262
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,800
Loki has his hand out for a microphone.

2263
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,800
Give me-

2264
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:18,800
Anyways.

2265
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,800
Yeah, there's going to be- I have some really small stuff.

2266
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,800
Real quick.

2267
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:27,800
Jasmine Toys announced Halo themed laser tag rifles.

2268
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:36,800
So yeah, this Jasmine laser command line apparently is this brand that competes with the other laser tag rifles.

2269
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:37,800
The other laser tag line out there.

2270
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:40,800
You know, the cheap ass ones that you buy at KV Toys and stuff.

2271
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,800
Laser cats.

2272
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,800
Speaking of which, their minds-

2273
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,800
Now that's what- God damn it, right there.

2274
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,800
That's what the PlayStation 3 needs.

2275
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,800
Laser cats.

2276
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:50,800
Laser cats the game.

2277
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:51,800
Show of hands.

2278
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:54,800
If they put out laser cats the game on the PlayStation 3, who would buy?

2279
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,800
All the hands in the room are up.

2280
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:57,800
My feet are up too.

2281
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:58,800
Oh my God.

2282
01:45:58,800 --> 01:45:59,800
There it is.

2283
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,800
Dude, somebody put a phone call into Sony right now.

2284
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,800
Dude, look up Sony's number.

2285
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:05,800
Can we call them right now?

2286
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,800
No.

2287
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,800
And speaking of which, we need to go play laser- or play QZR soon.

2288
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:12,800
Alright, fine.

2289
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,800
QZR trip.

2290
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,800
Dude, laser cats the game could save the PlayStation 3.

2291
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:17,800
Oh my God.

2292
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,800
I want a laser cat.

2293
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:20,800
I really do.

2294
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,800
Nobody knows what we're talking about, do they?

2295
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,800
Oh my God, they totally should.

2296
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,800
Paradox bits in chat.

2297
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:27,800
Hands, feet.

2298
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,800
SSJ 100 mat.

2299
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,800
Laser cats over Thunder cats.

2300
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,800
Act deaf says nope.

2301
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:34,800
No.

2302
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,800
No, they should just have a laser cat's cover for the Wiimote.

2303
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:38,800
There you go.

2304
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,800
Alright, sorry to interrupt.

2305
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,800
Anyway, let's make one.

2306
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,800
What's up on eBay?

2307
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,800
Just like cut out a stuffed animal cat.

2308
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,800
Just like take the stuffing out of a stuffed animal cat and like slide it over the Wiimote.

2309
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:50,800
No, we're going to go further.

2310
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:55,800
We're going to get an actual cat, you know, a taxidermist to make one.

2311
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,800
Meow, meow, meow.

2312
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,800
Hey Eddie, you forgot one thing.

2313
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:05,800
I just started using laser cats again.

2314
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,800
I love laser cats.

2315
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:08,800
Oh, God.

2316
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,800
We should be designing games.

2317
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,800
And cats.

2318
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:16,800
Let's quit the show and start orange lounge games, even though that Konami might sue us

2319
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,800
over that.

2320
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,800
We'll just start, you know, orange.

2321
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:20,800
Tabby cat.

2322
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,800
Or, I don't know, we'll start, you know, peach lounge games or something.

2323
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,800
That's terrible.

2324
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:26,800
How about sunrise?

2325
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,800
Yeah, there you go, sunrise.

2326
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,800
I don't know.

2327
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:30,800
Tangerine.

2328
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:31,800
Or Irene Mooney Me.

2329
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:32,800
I don't know.

2330
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:33,800
All right.

2331
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:34,800
Okay.

2332
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:35,800
Anything else, Loki?

2333
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,800
That's about it.

2334
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,800
All right.

2335
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,800
We're dorks.

2336
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,800
Gaming nerd says a samurai laser cats.

2337
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,800
Samurai laser cats.

2338
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:49,800
I used to watch that cartoon.

2339
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,800
Joshi says orange soda lounge games.

2340
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:52,800
There you go.

2341
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:53,800
Orange crush lounge games.

2342
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:54,800
Oh, my God.

2343
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,800
That would be another copyright infringement.

2344
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,800
I do it once.

2345
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:58,800
All right.

2346
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,800
Anyway.

2347
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:00,800
I know.

2348
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,800
Moving on, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2349
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,800
Rice Princess, thanks for being here and ruining the show with your dry wit.

2350
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:07,800
As always, your final thought.

2351
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:08,800
Dry wit, what?

2352
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:13,800
Well, I was thinking of this very serious, poignant matter.

2353
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,800
It's about time.

2354
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,800
Yeah.

2355
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,800
Eddie, your final thought.

2356
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,800
Hot tubs are cool.

2357
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,800
Pervert.

2358
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,800
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

2359
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,800
I hate people.

2360
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:33,800
Loki, your final thought.

2361
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:34,800
Oh, sorry.

2362
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:35,800
Blue mittens.

2363
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:38,800
Loki, your final thought.

2364
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,800
Guess reject false icons.

2365
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,800
Fuck the reject false icons.

2366
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,800
Worship those false icons like never before.

2367
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:50,800
Bow down to the golden cow.

2368
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,800
Oh, my God.

2369
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:52,800
Don't listen to the Moses scene, yeah.

2370
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,800
I've got a golden calf, yeah.

2371
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:00,800
My final thought is, am in joy.

2372
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,800
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.

2373
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,800
Please leave us a five-star retune on iTunes.

2374
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,800
Please leave us a dig.

2375
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:08,800
What do we have to do?

2376
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,800
I will send Rice Princess over there to make love to you, if that's what it takes.

2377
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,800
It's getting hot.

2378
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,800
You should declare your love for Rice Princess in a five-star iTunes review.

2379
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,800
Actually, I got a message from Speedy F40.

2380
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:23,800
It says, tell Rice Princess that I still have a crush on her because she sounds like a freak.

2381
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,800
Oh, that's kind of scary.

2382
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,800
There's going to be a love triangle going on here.

2383
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,800
Oh, my God.

2384
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:29,800
With who?

2385
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:30,800
All right.

2386
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,800
With Stacia.

2387
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,800
Do you like farting?

2388
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,800
What?

2389
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:38,800
Because you need to like that to be with Rice Princess.

2390
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:45,800
Well, Rice Princess will choose who her heart belongs to based on who leaves the most five-star

2391
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:46,800
iTunes reviews.

2392
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:47,800
There you go.

2393
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:48,800
Who sends me golden wow?

2394
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:49,800
No.

2395
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:53,800
In all seriousness, actually, remember what our new marketing director said.

2396
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,800
Tell two people about Orange Lawns Radio.

2397
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:56,800
That's all we ask.

2398
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,800
Then, if those two people tell two more people.

2399
01:49:58,800 --> 01:49:59,800
Oh, my God.

2400
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:00,800
Are you Ron Pupil?

2401
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,800
Like, if you tell someone, we'll give you a free food night.

2402
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,800
We'll throw in a free and enjoy A.

2403
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,800
That's already been eaten because we eat them.

2404
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,800
I'll autograph it and put it on eBay.

2405
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:12,800
It'll sell for millions.

2406
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:13,800
It'll sell for nothing.

2407
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:14,800
All right.

2408
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,800
We really need to end the show now, so cue the outgoing music, please.

2409
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:17,800
Cue cue.

2410
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:22,800
You've been listening to Orange Lawns Radio.
