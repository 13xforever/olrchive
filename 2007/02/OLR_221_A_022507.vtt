00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, February 25th, 2007, plenty of new games from Virtual Console are discovered,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
some Xbox 360 games are getting a price cut,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
and one TV station warns us about sexual predators on online games.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange, Lounge, Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
Today is February 25th, 2007. We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, the gaming lifestyle.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
If you play games online, you might see me post on forums.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Not joining us tonight, sadly, is Dark Sakura, also known as Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
She had some prior family engagements to attend to.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
We will be hearing from her in a special pre-taped segment later in the show,

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
but we've secretly replaced Dark Sakura with a furry gay man tonight.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Say hello to Eddie.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm Yummy.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, Casper the Gay. Am I supposed to refer to you as Casper the Gay?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, pretty much. No, it's alright. I don't care.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, how are you doing, Casper?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm great. I came down here having a good time.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
You remember those old commercials that's like, we secretly replaced so-and-so's Folgers with the new DeCap.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I don't know what the hell it is.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
I feel like we secretly replaced Jamie with a furry gay man.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
And they'll never know.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Alright, well, also joining us tonight, the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Hello.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
And we did not replace him with a furry gay man.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Thank God.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Or did we?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
No, we didn't.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Alright, how are you doing, Loki?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I'm doing fine.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Good, good to hear. I'm glad to see you're eating healthy tonight with the old Mickey D's.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
You know, their sweet and sour sauce tastes like it's been sitting out for a long time.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
It tastes a little off.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
But that does not mean that I'm not gonna, you know, and I'm also disappointed that I only got two packets of sweet and sour sauce versus three, because three's a lot better.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Doesn't McDonald's have some stupid policy, like if you order yay so many nuggets?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Yeah, but ten pieces, I'm supposed to get three.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
They fucking jit me.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Why don't you go in and ask to speak with the manager?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Because I don't care.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
You should be one of those people.

02:15.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm sure anybody in our chat room who's worked for fast food in the past has some story about some fucking bitch who came in there because they wanted extra sauce or, you know, oh, you gotta let the people to drive through who order like,

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
I want a super-sized burger, chicken McNuggets, super-sized fries, oh, and a Diet Coke.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Or even better, I want a six-piece McNugget with 12 sides of sweet and sour sauce.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
That's right, it makes me angsty.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Makes me angsty.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
God damn it, that's the second week in a row that's happened.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
That's more than a second week in a row.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
That's been like four weeks in a row.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I've been doing it on purpose.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
All right.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Say hello as well tonight to, uh...

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Murder!

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Say hello to Rice Princess.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
How you doing, Rice Princess?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Now's when you're supposed to cue one wing angel when I come...

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
That's all right.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
How you doing, Rice Princess?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm doing pretty good.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I'm eating McDonald's, too.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Very healthy.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I'm eating McDonald's, too.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Is this loud enough?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah, see?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Now, tonight I'm letting you see the monitor so you can see when you're loud enough.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Can I have a not-crappy mic to talk into?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
No.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Because I hate yelling and making it sound like I'm falling off a cliff.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
All right.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
How you doing, though, otherwise?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Pretty good.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
All right.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yep.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
All right.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Well, also say hello to our chat room.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Always another guest here on the program.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Hello, I am the chat room.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I noticed Tiger Claw in chat room says,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Sky, you do know the Oscars are on?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yep.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Well, last week it was the Grammys, or two weeks ago it was the Grammys.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
This week it's the Oscars.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
We just can't win.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
We're always up against something.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I mean, but come on.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Who cares?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
You're going to be able to read it tomorrow morning who won the Oscars.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
And let's be honest.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
You and I both know most people listen to this show in the audio archive or podcast form.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
And they can listen to that in the convenience of whenever they want.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
So it won't be up against the Oscars in that regard.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So we have to just keep doing a show like always.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Because if you want, I mean, if you don't want us to talk about video games,

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
we could just kind of like turn on the Oscars and just give live commentary.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
God Kate Winslet looks fat.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Wouldn't that be fun?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I did see a deal.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I will say Oscar chat real fast even though, you know,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
we're supposed to be keeping the random down tonight.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I will say I saw that in Notes on a Scandal,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
which is the one that Judi Dench is nominated for.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I went out and saw that last night.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
It's pretty good.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Pretty good.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Judi Dench plays a good, crazy old woman.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
She really does.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I hope she wins.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
But I hear that I didn't see the queen.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I hear that was really good too.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
But Judi Dench, has she ever been bad in any movie?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I don't think she has.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Nope.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I don't think she has.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
All right.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Joshi16 in the chat room has some harsh words for the podcast listeners.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
He said podcast equals lazy fans.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Ouch.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Ouch.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Burn.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
All right.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Well, let's get right into how we always start off the show,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
a little bit of how is your gaming week,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
where we talk about what we've been playing.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
And usually our chat room gets into it too.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Oh, first off, speaking of chat room, I want to say hi to the new listeners.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
I always make a chance to try to say hi to noobs that are in chat.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Level 10 noob.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Misty's not a noob.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
She's a long-time listener.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
She's in chat tonight.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
She hasn't been there for a long time.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
So hi, Misty.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Frisbee.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I don't recognize that name.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
And if I'm mistakenly pegging you as the new listener, I miss you.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I apologize.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
My brain can only hold so much.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
I don't recognize Heon64.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
That must be new.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
So welcome.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Proper T. Roboboy.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Actually, maybe there's been a Roboboy before.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I don't know.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Roboboy, I don't recognize you.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Noobs or people I'm calling noobs because I didn't recognize your name.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Welcome to chat.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
We have a lot of folks in chat tonight, a lot of regulars in there.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
We appreciate your support as always.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
But again, if you can't listen to us live because some of you guys have other things

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
to do on Sunday nights like Oscar parties or whatever stupid stuff you're doing,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
you can always download our podcast.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Send us e-mails.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Mailbag and orangeontrader.com.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Leave us voicemails.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Okay, I'll shut up.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
My gaming week was good.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It was all crackdown.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.500
It's lots of crackdown and the game is awesome except some co-op, depending on who you're

06:04.500 --> 06:08.000
playing with, I guess, can be very buggy or very laggy.

06:08.000 --> 06:16.000
Like, I played a co-op game with Jeremy Todd 1 today and yeah, it was pretty bad.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Like, I couldn't even move around and stuff.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
It was that laggy.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
But, and then again, I played another co-op game earlier in the week with Da Money.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
I don't remember the rest of the name on there, but that was pretty cool.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
And that was pretty fun because we were car surfing in that.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
I stood on top of his car and he was driving really fast and I was firing rockets at other

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
cars coming by and it was hilarious.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Couldn't stop laughing.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So, that's pretty fun.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
But the game itself is just really keeping my attention.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
I'm hoping for some good download content later on because I think once I do finish

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
the game and finally do get the rest of the achievements, it might just kind of crash

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
for me because you need to have some really good co-op stuff to be able to get a lot out

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
of the game.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
But, it's fun so far though.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
I love it.

07:03.000 --> 07:11.000
Then, of course, you know, the typical Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and I got a second

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
PSP that I'm fixing.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
It's all fixed now, but I have to order a new faceplate button for it because I bought

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
this third-party faceplate for it and it sucks balls.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
So, I always stick with first-party stuff because the third-party clear ones, they suck.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
I think that's all I've really played other than, you know, just Crackdown.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
So, yeah, kind of slow.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, Crackdown is what a lot of people have been playing.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
I haven't signed on to the Xbox a lot this week because I've been playing a lot of World

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
of Warcraft, but I have noticed a lot of people on my friends list have been playing Crackdown

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
because I actually do sign on the web to check my messages.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Like, you know, if I'm, you know, just because I get messages from listeners once in a while

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
like, hey, how come you're only playing shitty games or hey, how come I haven't seen you

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
in a while?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
So, I'll write.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
As long as it's text messages.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
If I get voice messages, it's harder to check those online.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
But, I do respond to all of them as I get them.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
I think from what I've been reading and what I've experienced so far, the co-op is broken

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
a little bit on Crackdown.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
You can't invite people.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
You can open your game up and then they can join it, but the inviting is broken.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
So that's supposed to be fixed in a later patch.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
So, when are you going to let me play Crackdown so I can decide if it's worth the 60 bucks

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
or not?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Well, I still want to play it.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
All right.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Well, you're going to come over at some point and show it to me, right?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I had it here today.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I didn't get the demo, quote unquote.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I didn't get it.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Like, I suck at those types of games.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
Oh, maybe you can see my save game where you can fire homing missiles at people.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
All right.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Let's see, what else?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
That's if you're a GamingWig?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
That's it.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
GamingWig was mostly World of War crack, as I said, Kid Icarus a lot on Nintendo.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Dude, that game, it's awesome.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It's hard as hell, but it's fun.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
That's the hardest game ever.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Dude, when I beat the first dungeon this week, I thought I was the shit because I'm like,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
oh my gosh, I'm over 21 and I can still beat the first dungeon.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I still have some skill at this game.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Yes.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
It was like getting to hear the theme.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
How many people have actually heard other music in the game besides the very first stage?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Not a lot.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Exactly.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
Most people have only heard the first stage music, so it's kind of neat to hear the second

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
stage theme.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Anyway, I'm sure there's a lot of listeners, though, that are like, I already beat the

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
game, Rob.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
What's taking you so long?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah, I'm nine years old and I beat the game like 500 times.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Dude, when I was nine years old, I beat the game 500 times, too.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Shut up.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
But also, I used Icarus Fights Medusa Angels.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
Anyway, also, I went to the arcade this week, which was kind of cool because I had a date

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Friday, and he actually wanted to go to the arcade because we didn't really have a set

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
plan, but he's kind of got a dorky side to him, so he had suggested we go to the arcade.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Dude, he made me play seven games of DDR.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It was awesome.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
We played seven games of DDR.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
I'm having a whole new respect for DDR Supernova, which I have yet to really have played a whole

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
lot of, which is cool.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Then I played DDR Disney Mix, a lot of dumb stuff.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
But then we played some old school games I haven't played forever, like Soul Calibur 2.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
I played Soul Calibur 2, and first off, Young Sung is awesome.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Usually, I play female characters in games because they're better in fighting games.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
They're more agile, usually.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
But Young Sung is the best character in Soul Calibur, hands down.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
I made it all the way to the boss, so I know that machine was set on easy because I suck

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
at Soul Calibur.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
You're like, what's going on?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
That's exactly what I said.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I kept winning, and I looked at my date and I said, I don't know why I keep winning.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I'm sorry.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You're just standing there the whole time.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
You're not even pushing any buttons.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm really sorry that I'm winning.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Hey, what's going on?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
No, to answer chat, I do not have a boyfriend.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I think he listens to this once in a while.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I went on a date.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
There's a big difference.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Oh, God.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Anyway, I shouldn't talk about my personal life on this program.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah, you should.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
I really shouldn't.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh, I played Mario Kart Arcade, which was fun, because they fixed their machine at Golf

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Land, and now the picture camera thing works again.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
It's a lot of fun.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I actually won the race.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
I'm getting good at Mario Kart Arcade.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
That must be on easy, too.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
No, we played a normal track.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
We didn't play the easiest one.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
We played on normal.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
True.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
No, I swear.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
That game's a waste of money, man.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
It's kind of hokey.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Mario Kart in the arcade does not nearly have the same magic as it does at home.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
Why don't you just take a picture of yourself and tape it to the screen if you really want

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
your face on the thing?

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
It would be better if you had eight of those machines.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Then it would be better with the pictures.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
I could see Dave and Busters having all these machines next to each other.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
In fact, I bet there's a Dave and Buster somewhere that has it.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
But when you only have two, it is kind of hokey.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And the game itself is not the same magic as the home.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
It's really not.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
It's like a whole different engine or something.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
If you want to see the Mario Kart Arcade, by the way, search for Orange Lounge on YouTube,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
and there's a video of Loki playing Mario Kart drunk.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
It's hilarious.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
At his bachelor party.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Awesome.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
We need to put more crap on YouTube.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Eddie, you're a camera person, right?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah, I have a digital camera where we can download stuff.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Yeah.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Just took it up to the USB.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
You need to do video.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
You need to be like our official Orange Lounge videographer.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Seriously, yeah.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
That's what I'll do.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
That'll be rad.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Let's do that.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
It's on.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
All right.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
It's on.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
All right.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Anyhow, let's go around and figure out some other gaming weeks.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Oh, more wow.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Yep.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Good times on there.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
Oh, I'm so happy because like my 29 Rogue on Elder Thallus, I got some poor sap to give

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
me a plus 15 agi on my dagger.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
That's kind of expensive.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Did you just call it agi?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Agility.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
It's agility.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Agility.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I call it agi.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Agi is how you abbreviate it.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
That's like me saying-

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Agi is going to be a punch in your face.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh, Rice Princess, you make me lull.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Oh, Rob.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Deaf, please.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Please.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Rob, I've got to heal it in.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Rolled full of mao.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Rolled full of mao.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
JK.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Anyway.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Oh my gosh.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Now I'm going to leave.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
No, but yeah, it's pretty much been wow.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Whoop dee doo.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Good wow times.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
I played for about, I don't know, like an hour, hour and a half on Back Me Wool, and

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
I did two quests.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I don't even know why I went on.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I'm like, man.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
And they were in the Barrens, so you know how you could do like 10 quests at the same

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
time in the Barrens?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm like, I'll just not do anything.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Because you got tied up in Barrens Chat?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
No, I got tied up in G Chat, yo.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Guild Chat.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Let's not abbreviate that.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yes, please.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Thank you.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Guild Chat.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Sorry.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
So, yeah.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Did you actually sign on to the Guild and go, what up, G?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
No.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
No, just curious.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Eddie, how was your gaming week?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
It was awesome.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I've been doing the virtual console thing too, so I got Donkey Kong Country.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh my god, that game still kicks ass.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
I love that game.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah, but it's not as good because I have GameCube controllers for my Wii instead of

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
the classic controllers, and that doesn't work.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
But it's still fun.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Like, because you can't run and jump at the same time because of the way that the X and

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
the B buttons are positioned on the GameCube controller.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
So, it's still awesome, though.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Like, nobody else cares, though.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah, we don't.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
But yeah, I also got Kid Icarus, and that game is the hardest game I've ever played

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
in like 27 years of video gaming.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It's ridiculous.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I'm trying to think of games that are harder than Kid Icarus.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Battletoads, if they ever put Battletoads.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Battletoads, oh my god, I love that game.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
That is great.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Virtual console, you are fucked.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
No, I love, because you can attack your partner.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Because you know that's one of those like two players at the same time, like Contra?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
You could like double dragon.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
You could attack your friend.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
It's awesome.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Totally.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Rygar is pretty hard.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I love Rygar.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
So do I.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
But it's hard.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
Like, try getting to the last boss without a fucking game genie code or something.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
If you have a normal NES.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
Wasn't Rygar so hard because you couldn't save it, or you couldn't, like you had to

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
beat it one city?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I don't think there was a, yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
You had to do it.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
You had to beat it one city.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
And you could only continue I think so many times too.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
So, it was pretty hard.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah, that's how all games were back in the day though.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah, I guess.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Alright.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Uh huh.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I'm looking at what's going on in chat room.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
JV Mon says, Sky, are you fucking with Rice Princess's volume?

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Yes, sorry, if you are noticing audio problems, I'm fucking with her volume as she's talking

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
because Rice Princess has a naturally quiet voice.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm trying to be loud.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
See, oh man, am I like super loud now?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Like, can two people in China hear me now?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I think we're good.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh, okay.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
But make sure if Loki talks, he uses this mic and not the one you're on.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Okay.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Okay.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Thank you.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Alright.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Because I guess the guys in studio have louder voices anyway, not that you guys want to know

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
that.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Eddie, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Nope.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Alright.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Let's get into some gaming news then.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, first actually, some housekeeping.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
First off, obviously Dark Sakura's not here tonight.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
You will be hearing her in a tape segment in part B though.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
She still is joining us for the mailbag, so Dark Sakura fans have that to look forward

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
to in our B segment.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
And also in our B segment tonight, which I'm making the first half of the show sound really

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
boring, but an old favorite from OLR comes back tonight.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
You asked for it.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Tonight we're going to play some Beat the Host.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Tonight is Beat the Host.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Literally, we're going to be beating Robin Elle.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Oh, can I like punch you in the face?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
No, you don't actually Beat the Host.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Oh, man, dammit.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I know you guys are kind of new to Beat the Host.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Beat the Host is we're changing the format a little bit for Beat the Host tonight, but

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
it's basically how well do you know your video game music.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
And a listener gets to take on a host of their choosing.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
I'm going to tell you what, if you don't have a knowledge of classic arcade games tonight,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
don't even bother.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Okay, then don't pick me.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Don't even try tonight because it's going to be killer.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's way harder than any of the others we've done, I think.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
There are some that are easy, but some are hard.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
We'll get into that in part B.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I was like five years old when the arcade games were popular.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
I know, so don't pick me.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Well, then you better pick Loki, I guess.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
He might be the only challenge in here.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
We'll see.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Or you can pick Rice Princess just to embarrass her with her lack of classic arcade knowledge,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
so this will be fun.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
All right, we'll see what happens.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
That would suck.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
All right, let's move on and go into some gaming news this week, starting off with some

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
virtual console news.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
We're going to talk about a new feature that has shown up on the virtual console, but not

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
in this country.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
It's over in the UK.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
What's interesting is that a new bonus is now waiting for them on the front page when

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
they log in.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It's not a very well-hidden secret.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It looks a little text-drawn smiley.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
What happens when you go into it, it's the Warp Zone.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
It's this new area on the Wii called the Nintendo Warp Zone.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
What the Warp Zone has is just some trivia and cool stuff.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Right now, what they have on there is some little Kirby trivia.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
They have Kirby history and Kirby trivia, which would make sense because obviously the

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Kirby game.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Did they get the Kirby game in Europe released on their console yet?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
I know we got it here.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
I'm assuming Kirby Europe, if they don't already have it, isn't far behind.

17:37.000 --> 17:44.000
That is kind of opening the potential to having this cool little Nintendo fan niche center

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
that is possible to show up on the Wii.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I'm betting if the UK has it, we're going to get it any day now here in the US.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
They also did a new channel.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
They did the Everybody Votes channel.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
That's last week's news.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Yeah, but they could have that on that too.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
You could vote on different Nintendo trivia.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
That's what a lot of people are saying they should have done with the Everybody Votes

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
channels.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
They should have had Nintendo trivia and stuff.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Who do you like better?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Mario, Luigi, that type of thing.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Instead, they decided to waste the whole space of my channel block here.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Granted, I know it's an optional download, but you know what though?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
It's still retarded.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
It's just like the news channel.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
That's retarded too.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
And the weather channel.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
The weather channel, great.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
I get to find out what the weather was at midnight.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Like hours ago.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
The forecast works fine.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
It's lame.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
It's better than nothing.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It's better than nothing.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Right?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
The music in the forecast channel is off.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Okay.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Obviously, I'm reaching.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I'm sorry.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
JV Mon says, I use the weather channel.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
GS68 is calling Loki the resident Wii hater.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I think that's not true.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Loki loves his Wii.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Right.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
I totally hate my Wii that I bought with tons of games and stuff.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
You didn't have to camp out because of distribution, but whatever.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
You got on launch day or before.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
No, you had your Wii like three days before launch.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
I remember going over there playing that horrible, horrible Red Steel.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
We didn't play Red Steel the first day, but you played at the party and that was awful.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
It doesn't matter.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Nobody cares.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
No, it's not okay with players.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
No, Red Steel.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
It's a horrible game.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Alright.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Horrible game.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Most person shooters and shooters are though.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
No, just Red Steel because Red Steel sucks balls.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Anyways, one thing that will not suck balls, hopefully,

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
is going to be some Neo Geo and MSX games coming to the Virtual Console.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
And the first couple titles, at least the MSX titles,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
and this is going to be on the Japanese service, of course, for right now,

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
Eggie and Alest are going to be the first MSX titles

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
and they're going to be 800 Wii points each.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Then both are due out in spring.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Hopefully we'll see some more SNK stuff come over.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
Personally, I would hope for Magical Lord and No Metal Slug

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
because, my God, how many times do they even read?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Oh, I don't know.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
How about Fatal Fury Special,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
one of my favorite fighting games ever next to Street Fighter.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Are you being sarcastic?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
No, I fucking love Fatal Fury Special.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I like Fatal Fury.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I like King of Fighters.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Samurai Showdown.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
They need Samurai Showdown because that was great too.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Or the best fucking game on Neo Geo ever,

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
Magical Drop.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Or King of Monsters, I think.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Yeah, good times.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
That's very interesting because did they say that at launch

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
that they were going to partner with Neo Geo?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
I don't think they did.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
I remember hearing about MSX.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I remember MSX, which was very exciting

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
because a lot of people were going,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
ooh, now we can get the true sequel to Metal Gear

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
and all that stuff that was only on the MSX,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
like the Metal Gear 2,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
not that SNK's Revenge stuff we had here in the US.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
Or just being able to play the original Metal Gear in the MSX format

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
might be kind of interesting.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
They could like retranslate it so that you don't have,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
you know, the truck have started to move.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
No, they should keep that in there.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
You like that?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Yeah.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
All right.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
What were the other translations in that?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I'm getting sleepy.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
I fall asleep or something like that.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah, probably.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
I don't know.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Forget it.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
So I'm excited.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Any other MSX or Neo Geo games you'd want to see?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm not really familiar with the MSX too much,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
so I don't know.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
What was the name of that game,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Blue's Journey or Blue's Adventure or something like that?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Blue's Clues?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
No.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
We just figured out Blue's Clues.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
We just figured out Blue's Clues.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
You can get off the show now.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
No, it was the one where he like had,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
never mind, nobody knows what I'm talking about.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Forget it.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Jerks.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
What was I going to say?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
What else on Neo Geo?

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Oh, as long as we don't get 50,000 clones of Puzzle Bobble,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
like there were in the arcade.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Like every year there's a new Puzzle Bobble,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
and it's always the same damn game.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It's the same game every year.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of that,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
even though I love like puzzle games and stuff.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Shadow Charlie wants to see Super Baseball 2020.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Okay.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Rob D wants to see King of Fighters 98.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Hell yeah.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Lots of King of Fighters games too.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
All the King of Fighters games.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
But I don't mind seeing new ones of those every year.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Yeah, seriously.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
That's awesome.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Yeah, they need to like keep making them.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Thank you.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Hitstun remembers the translation,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
I feel asleep.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
It was I feel asleep.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
That's awesome.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Thank you, Hitstun.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Gold star for you.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yep.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
All right, let's see.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Moving on with some other gaming news.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
This, oh my gosh, this makes me so excited.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
Square Enix is moving to put their first virtual console title on the Wii in Japan.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Yes.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
And if I tell you Square Enix is putting,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
unless you've already heard this,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
don't guess you've already heard,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
but if I told you Square Enix was putting a game on virtual console,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
what would you think it is?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Square Enix.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Like the original Final Fantasy, right?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
That's what Eddie's saying, Final Fantasy?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah, I would agree.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
No, it's even better.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
It's like one of my favorite Super Nintendo games ever,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
next to Final Fantasy III, VI, whatever you want to say.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh my God, what is it, Rom?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Actraiser.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Oh my God.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
That game's so awesome.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
I played that on a ROM, which I don't do because that's illegal,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
but I did play that and that's like a,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
it's like a cross between SimCity and like a side-scroller adventure game.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
And sex.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
And awesomeness.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Because it's like, no, you know what really makes Actraiser is Yuzo Koshiro.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
And music, right?

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
The music in Actraiser is one of the most phenomenal soundtracks ever, ever.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
And for those of you guys that are listening live tonight,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
you're actually going to get a treat during our break.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
We can't play it on the podcast because it's copyright,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
but you're going to get Actraiser music during the break tonight

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
because I love it that much.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
So, Sky, when's that coming out on virtual console?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Well, we don't know yet.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Exactly.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
We know it's going to be March in Japan.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
So, you know, but that's a good sign that it'll probably make its way over here

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
like end of March, April.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
That's awesome.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I can't, I'm so downloading this.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Actraiser 2 wasn't even that bad.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
It's just that they took out the simulation element of the game.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
The simulation was fun.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I mean, it was like a Greek, you know,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
you were developing a Greek civilization or whatever.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
But Actraiser, seriously,

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
the only problem with Actraiser is that you can blast through the game

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
in about four hours.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Well, maybe long.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Maybe just about four hours.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I remember beating it when I rented it in one night.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
That's pretty similar to a lot of old games.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I mean, especially NES games.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Like, you could get through them in a couple hours.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah, so that's okay.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Yeah, I'm so freaking excited.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
That's awesome.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
A lot of folks in chat don't seem to know what Actraiser is in chat.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Highon64, I'm sorry if I mispronounced that,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
says, don't be ashamed, GS68.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I don't know what Actraiser is either.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Seriously, go online.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Go to Wikipedia and look it up or download the ROM,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
although I didn't tell you to do that.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
It's awesome.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
What's funny is it was in that,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
because in Super Nintendo when they first came out,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
they had like a strategy guide.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
It was basically showcasing all the Super Nintendo games

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
were going to come out.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
And it was in that.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
But I don't think it got a lot of coverage and like advertising

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
and I don't think anybody knew about it.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
It was definitely more of a cult game, I think.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
I think so, too, because I never played it when I was younger.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Don't see a lot of those games that cross genres.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
And that's why Actraiser 2 was kind of forgettable,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
whereas Actraiser 1, you had those, you know,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
side-scrolling action stages like the ghosts and goblins type theme

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
with just this most beautiful music you've ever heard in a Super Nintendo game

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
mixed with simulation scenes that are so different,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
but they blend in the game so well,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
because you get things in the simulation scene,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
you use in the action scene.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
I mean, one of the all-time greatest games.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Seriously.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Okay, am I thinking of the right game

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
where you're like an angel and you go and you like...

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yes, so you can see its little butt.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Yeah, pervert, you only you would know that.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
You're like, ugh, hot angel butt.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
For the rest of the time you're like a god.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah, that's, or like, I don't know.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
You're an angel and you're like planning crops or something like that

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
and you like...

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
In the side-scroll, you're a god.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Oh really?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
In the side-scroll is you're a god?

25:31.000 --> 25:31.000
Is that what you said, Eddie?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.440
Is that what you said Eddie? Yes, okay

25:34.400 --> 25:39.000
That's great. I guess I didn't play enough of it. No. Yeah, that was that was a whole theme of the game

25:39.000 --> 25:40.640
You were God. Oh

25:40.640 --> 25:45.340
Yeah, and you had to go down to earth to fix the suffering and it's actually actually like the music

25:46.280 --> 25:49.120
Fits the emotion of the game like so well, I'm sorry

25:49.120 --> 25:54.640
I sound like such a ham, but it's true. Like it's one of the early great like it's so great. Did you cry?

25:55.220 --> 25:59.560
No, not at that. I did cry at a Super Nintendo game though, which one tell me

25:59.560 --> 26:06.280
Tell me damn it. Tell me right now. No gonna punch you in your face three Final Fantasy 2. Oh my god

26:06.280 --> 26:10.320
Was it because it was so bad? No, because I beat it and the ending was so great

26:12.120 --> 26:18.160
Like finally I need a game in my life. We're getting like 12 years old. Okay. I wasn't like falling I was like

26:18.680 --> 26:21.400
It wasn't like when I saw dancer in the dark the first time

26:21.800 --> 26:23.800
It was just like a little bit

26:23.800 --> 26:29.360
I'm so sad it's over. Tear tear. All right. Anyway, sorry

26:29.800 --> 26:35.020
Anyways, well if Actraiser isn't your cup of tea, there's gonna be some more stuff coming from Sega

26:35.400 --> 26:39.680
Seriously, I want you to unsubscribe from this show. If Actraiser is not your cup of tea

26:39.680 --> 26:45.500
You do not deserve to listen. No, I'm kidding. Obviously. There goes all of our listeners. Bye guys. It's nice knowing you

26:45.840 --> 26:49.640
Anyways, some new titles from Sega. We're gonna see Sword of a Million

26:49.640 --> 26:53.640
Vectorman, Sonic Spinball, and Beyond Oasis

26:54.440 --> 26:57.680
so those should be coming within the next couple weeks and

26:58.440 --> 27:01.560
There was also some other stuff. I was just reading here last minute from

27:02.080 --> 27:05.480
Hudson that was coming out on the virtual console and these are also kind of exciting

27:06.320 --> 27:08.600
you're gonna be getting double dungeons and

27:09.440 --> 27:14.560
Splatterhouse in March Oh God splatter house do a fancy star for real. Yeah

27:15.200 --> 27:18.000
Yeah, I saw a fantasy stars coming out too for a virtual console

27:18.000 --> 27:20.280
That's awesome. Where'd you hear that?

27:21.280 --> 27:23.280
from the internet

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Most reliable source ever

27:27.240 --> 27:35.200
Yeah, so I know those two looks like they're gonna be both 600 points and according to Hudson's site both do out

27:36.040 --> 27:38.040
on March

27:38.520 --> 27:39.900
Sonic Spinball

27:39.900 --> 27:44.240
Cuz he mentioned it is one of those games like complete opposite end for Mac Tracer. Okay?

27:44.240 --> 27:49.000
It's one of those games that like you remember as being really cool like, you know

27:49.000 --> 27:53.400
Oh, it's Sonic is a pinball game. And oh, I remember this game was just so awesome

27:53.400 --> 27:56.620
And then you play it for five minutes and you go god this shit's boring

27:57.640 --> 27:59.160
Isn't it is it just me?

27:59.160 --> 28:04.280
No, it's kind of like you like when I go around you and then you start talking to me for about five minutes

28:04.280 --> 28:06.280
I'm like, I want to go home

28:06.880 --> 28:12.300
Except not really because I love you Rob hearts to you. Let's be the last episode orange launch radio. You ever hear

28:12.300 --> 28:17.220
Mm-hmm. Bye speaking of people that shouldn't be talking more than five minutes at a time

28:18.180 --> 28:20.180
Perrin Kaplan

28:20.300 --> 28:23.620
Opened her mouth about some new things going on the week, by the way

28:23.620 --> 28:29.480
I believe Perrin Kaplan also said that the gamecube had been ceased production that there's no more game cubes

28:29.480 --> 28:34.420
Right, and then it came out later in the week that oh just kidding. We really haven't stopped making the game cubes

28:34.420 --> 28:37.460
I think Perrin Kaplan is kind of like I kind of treat her like

28:37.460 --> 28:44.460
Opposite woman like when she says something the opposite is actually true. It's this clever marketing play

28:44.460 --> 28:47.980
Yeah, anytime she talks it's like Oh introduction to the opposites

28:49.980 --> 28:51.980
Gets that

28:52.500 --> 28:58.900
This must be the introduction to the opposite sketch. I totally got it. Okay, but you get it too. Oh wow

28:59.740 --> 29:03.540
Just like the other things that she said. Oh the weeds gonna be region-free

29:03.540 --> 29:09.020
That was turned out to be true. It's not one of the other gems. Yeah, that was the other gem that she said

29:10.020 --> 29:14.580
Some other things she talked about is that there could already be a Wii revision on the Wii

29:15.100 --> 29:17.100
DVD playback enabled on it

29:18.180 --> 29:23.780
Okay, okay. What do you mean? Oh my god? There's already a how many DVD players do you have in your house?

29:24.860 --> 29:28.340
Three or four so do you need another one on the Wii? I don't think so

29:28.340 --> 29:34.300
I don't cares. Yeah, I don't bring the pink we out already. I don't think anyone's not buying the Wii because

29:35.020 --> 29:39.260
It doesn't have DVD playback. I know that's just a stupid feature anyways

29:39.260 --> 29:43.800
I mean, it's kind of thrown in because you know their DVD ROM drives might as well

29:43.800 --> 29:49.320
Just put the codex in there. Yeah, that was like popular like five years ago when nobody had a DVD and now it's like hey

29:50.740 --> 29:54.820
Exactly so I mean the game cube didn't really play DVDs, so

29:54.820 --> 30:02.140
Who gives a shit looking at our chat chat dot orange launch radio comm speedy f40 says the game cube will live on forever

30:02.620 --> 30:06.780
Well, yeah, cuz the Wii will play all your GameCube games, so I mean I mean seriously

30:06.780 --> 30:08.740
I when I heard that it was going away

30:08.740 --> 30:12.180
I was like well that makes sense but the best part about the Wii playing the GameCube games

30:12.180 --> 30:14.020
And I always have to explain this to my customers

30:14.020 --> 30:18.140
They're running out GameCube games for the Wii and stuff if you don't have GameCube controllers

30:18.140 --> 30:21.840
You're fucked you can't play your GameCube games without GameCube controllers

30:21.840 --> 30:27.020
Which to be honest is the dumbest thing in the world anyways they should totally support the you know classic controller

30:27.020 --> 30:29.020
I third-party controllers

30:29.020 --> 30:33.420
Okay, or I'm just saying well. What about you know the classic controller

30:33.420 --> 30:39.120
They should you know support that so you don't have to buy yet another fucking controller to plug in to play the GameCube games

30:40.380 --> 30:43.700
Let's see act def says who the hell listens to parent Kaplan

30:43.700 --> 30:47.540
Okay, look show me five gaming blogs that did not run the story this week

30:47.540 --> 30:53.600
Okay, that run stories on Nintendo usually the thing is is that whatever she says makes it on every major gaming blog out there

30:53.600 --> 30:55.780
So and for some reason we posted that as well

30:56.700 --> 31:00.620
Joe she 16 says she is a classic contrary Mary

31:01.580 --> 31:03.580
I've never heard that term Wow

31:04.180 --> 31:07.620
contrary Mary contrary contrary Mary I guess

31:08.460 --> 31:11.060
Very emphasis on the wrong syllable

31:11.060 --> 31:15.500
I said it's a contra no contrary

31:16.900 --> 31:23.100
Let's see what else is there uh let's see footy monster. No. I'm sorry who said it was a selling point

31:24.140 --> 31:28.960
Damn it somebody in chat room. I'm sorry whoever said it. Oh footy. Oh footy monster did say it doesn't matter sky

31:28.960 --> 31:36.480
It's a selling point talking about the DVD playback. Yeah, it's like well. I don't know who cares really well. I don't know what

31:37.220 --> 31:38.820
Fix their online

31:38.820 --> 31:42.700
That'd be great. Let's fix the online something that we're actually going to use instead of

31:43.180 --> 31:46.660
Let's make DVD playback all in time. Yeah, okay

31:46.660 --> 31:49.780
We've established that you're the only one that the messages don't download when it's off

31:49.780 --> 31:51.140
No, it doesn't work for me either

31:51.140 --> 31:55.200
It works for me because I'm the cooler than you because you have that USB you have a dongle

31:55.540 --> 31:58.620
You use your dongle and the dongle makes it all work

32:00.140 --> 32:04.420
It does quite look like a penis for the computer anyway moving right along anyway

32:04.420 --> 32:10.500
So you know if you're looking forward to more independent games on the Wii and they have this big program that they were touting

32:10.940 --> 32:13.900
Originally saying that they were going to fund you know a bunch of independent games

32:14.740 --> 32:21.100
This whole independent development developer program in which they would give them free development kits and that kind of stuff

32:21.180 --> 32:25.240
Well the only problem is they don't have enough development kits to go around apparently

32:25.240 --> 32:28.220
They're also in short supply just like the actual Wiis are

32:28.220 --> 32:34.260
So a lot of these independent developers aren't going to get to make their crappy ports of games that they probably already released

32:34.260 --> 32:41.620
Well the sad part of that is though for those that were wondering where are the downloadable indie games on the virtual console?

32:41.900 --> 32:48.080
They haven't even there. They're just a they're a twinkle in mommy's eye right now because there's no dev kits. That's it

32:49.340 --> 32:50.420
What?

32:50.420 --> 32:55.020
Never mind, but you know to be honest, so there's gonna be some there's just starting

32:55.020 --> 33:01.180
You know to get those really crappy games out there. I mean was I was gonna say there's one game coming out in

33:01.820 --> 33:05.500
April which I know everybody's gonna run out and pick up chicken shoot

33:07.500 --> 33:12.260
On the Wii yes, it's a game where you shoot chickens

33:12.260 --> 33:17.020
Do it if it's if it's like duck hunt with chickens sold oh my god chicken

33:17.020 --> 33:21.780
She didn't instantly sell that title if they just change it to cock shoot. Hey wait a minute wait a minute

33:21.780 --> 33:26.140
Who are you? Oh by the way? This is like you style highlight. You know I'm showing a long time

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
longtime listener

33:30.900 --> 33:36.420
Now you've been on the show before but not not in its podcast form so nobody knows who you are in other words, okay?

33:36.420 --> 33:41.500
Well, I'm just the nameless voice well really well wait really quickly your three favorite games of all time

33:41.500 --> 33:47.020
and why really quickly so we know what type of gamer you are Final Fantasy 6 chrono trigger and

33:47.020 --> 33:50.180
Chicken shoot

33:54.060 --> 33:56.060
All right

33:57.180 --> 33:59.500
Mm-hmm he's a big do cosplay

34:00.940 --> 34:03.580
No, I'm kidding. You know he's a big fan of Actraiser

34:03.900 --> 34:09.020
He played act you just missed the Actraisers come in a virtual console in Japan. I know I got a boat or two

34:09.580 --> 34:16.620
Alright, you know so yeah that that's it. No no development kit for me the poor independent folks

34:16.620 --> 34:17.980
You know

34:17.980 --> 34:21.060
Poor them they can't get free development kids. Oh

34:22.140 --> 34:23.420
You cute

34:23.420 --> 34:28.100
GS 68 says crack shoot how about instead of chickens you if they bring out chicken shoot

34:28.100 --> 34:31.980
I think there should be another mode in it like you remember how a duck hunt had the duck shoot

34:31.980 --> 34:36.140
And then they had the sleigh shooting. Yeah, they should have chicken shoot and waffle shoot

34:40.780 --> 34:43.380
Speedy f-40 wants to see cock block for the Wii

34:43.380 --> 34:49.460
I mean interesting tie isn't that isn't that what was that PSP cock block for the Wii was that PSP game

34:49.460 --> 34:52.060
We played at the Konami Brooktown isn't that kind of what?

34:53.100 --> 34:54.660
Forget it no

34:54.660 --> 34:59.140
That's just one of those games is like I'm so popular in the fictional high school

34:59.340 --> 35:02.460
If only it were true in real life stick it in the game

35:03.740 --> 35:09.540
Stick it in the game. No stick it in comma the game get it never mind like

35:09.540 --> 35:15.660
Bunga that doesn't even make sense you wouldn't even put a comma there, so that's all I know Wario where smooth moves

35:16.020 --> 35:20.620
Is there is there a minigame in where we're smooth moves that stick it in no you stick in the game

35:20.980 --> 35:25.640
Remember that one where you push down the Super Nintendo game in there man all right moving on anyway um

35:26.380 --> 35:28.540
Speaking of the Wii since we have a lot of Wii news tonight

35:28.540 --> 35:31.960
This is also noteworthy because weezer still very hard to find yet

35:32.040 --> 35:36.340
They have outsold the 360 and the PlayStation 3 in January

35:36.340 --> 35:41.820
And this is some preliminary data that made its way onto the internet the Wii sold

35:42.340 --> 35:46.420
436 hundred I'm sorry four hundred thirty six thousand units 360

35:47.140 --> 35:49.140
294,000 units PlayStation 3

35:50.260 --> 35:57.140
244,000 units so it is it's only 50,000 units separating 360 and PlayStation 3 then again 360 has been on the market for a year

35:57.140 --> 36:00.820
So it doesn't look too good for Sony Sony might need some games to come out pretty soon

36:00.820 --> 36:06.900
To rescue them, but who knows what's gonna happen motor storms coming out in fucking a couple weeks

36:06.900 --> 36:09.900
And I cannot wait to play that average racing game

36:11.140 --> 36:16.160
But it's still fun. It looks awesome. Well. I'm sure there's some is it on the show world tonight some of the play

36:16.160 --> 36:18.300
I don't think we put Q Burt or flow or that stuff

36:18.300 --> 36:21.700
So I guess we could take a moment to mention that Q Burt and flow made its way to the yeah

36:21.700 --> 36:25.260
I heard Q Burt together. I heard Q Burt sucks and flow is short

36:25.260 --> 36:31.420
I heard they redid Q Burt, and I heard it sucks really. I like Q Burt. I want to play it

36:31.420 --> 36:33.420
Can I will you download it can I come over and play it? I?

36:33.860 --> 36:37.860
Don't know if I want to waste that kind of money. Oh come on. I'll don't you bought a PlayStation

36:37.860 --> 36:40.820
Oh, well you didn't buy the PlayStation you bought games for the PlayStation 3

36:42.340 --> 36:45.580
You bought Ridge Racer 7 when you already had it when it was called Ridge Racer

36:45.580 --> 36:51.380
I know it still sucks, and I bought full auto 2 and it's still full auto 1

36:51.380 --> 36:56.660
They just put it in new packaging at a crappy deathmatch mode, and I was a sucker

36:57.100 --> 36:59.500
And I bought that crap so you can say yeah

36:59.500 --> 37:01.100
You're getting some compliments tonight

37:01.100 --> 37:06.780
Seisha says Loki is great this evening and a footy monster says Loki is picking up the slack for dark soccer tonight

37:06.780 --> 37:08.780
He's like double pissed off

37:08.980 --> 37:13.660
It's just I mean I hate these games that they put out at launch and they call this sequel

37:13.660 --> 37:14.940
And it's really not a sequel

37:14.940 --> 37:21.180
It's just like fucking it's like a perfect example is for the Wii coming out next month Prince of Persia rival sword

37:21.180 --> 37:28.460
It's fucking two thrones all over again. All you do is tack on some stupid controls to it and added chariot racing

37:30.020 --> 37:36.220
Chariot race that was the only thing that was missing from the first one. Oh god. I really wish there was chariot racing in this

37:37.740 --> 37:39.740
They got my letters yes

37:40.660 --> 37:45.100
Ravens dolphin in the chat room says a flow is a beautiful screensaver. Yes

37:45.100 --> 37:52.460
I hear it's a screen saver the reviews. I've heard like it's after dark at the game listen. Okay listen Sony

37:53.180 --> 38:00.660
Stop making games that utilize this stupid tilt functionality crap because to be honest. They're not that great

38:00.660 --> 38:06.420
I mean flow okay. That's kind of cool. You know because it was a cool web game when it was free and stuff

38:07.460 --> 38:14.220
But this like super rubber dub or whatever it's coming out with the Ducks. It's the same damn game again

38:14.220 --> 38:16.220
It's just like that other

38:17.060 --> 38:22.180
Game that was out there right now. That's kind of a clone of geometry wars that one sucks to

38:22.660 --> 38:25.580
Stop releasing games. It's just a stupid gimmick

38:26.780 --> 38:29.220
Jeremy Todd one in chat have some advice for Sony

38:29.220 --> 38:34.420
This is sure to make the Sony fanboys very pleased Jeremy Todd one says I got an idea for what Sony should do I think

38:34.420 --> 38:39.460
Sony should go ride the roller coaster at death right into the lake of fire doom and torture where its eyes will get ripped and

38:39.460 --> 38:44.260
Then they're forced to eat the eyes with a broken fork where they will continually watch bad TV shows over and over

38:45.100 --> 38:50.420
You can address those cards and letters to Jeremy Todd one care of orange lounge anyways so more happy stuff though

38:51.220 --> 38:55.220
Elite beat agents is getting a sequel which isn't too surprising because the game is pretty awesome

38:56.140 --> 39:01.060
So definitely actually it is surprising is the game didn't sell as well as they thought it would especially not in Japan

39:01.060 --> 39:05.980
Yeah, but it's Nintendo. They're not gonna come up with anything original gaming come on. He's so are you smoking crack?

39:06.140 --> 39:08.340
What is the we what is the we?

39:08.340 --> 39:11.980
Oh, okay, I'm not gonna come up with something original, okay?

39:11.980 --> 39:19.300
Let me see here um another Super Mario sequel another Metroid sequel another Donkey Kong sequel whoo. That's brand new shit

39:19.300 --> 39:21.380
I think we got a wee leadest here

39:22.900 --> 39:30.580
Anyways, so a leap e agents with yet more you know some different music because this is what this is the natural progression of your

39:30.580 --> 39:33.460
You know music games is let's get some different music

39:33.460 --> 39:41.020
Um they're not really specifying a release date yet, but they're seeing that the new game is gonna have four player action and

39:41.980 --> 39:43.980
It's gonna have a new snappy title

39:45.980 --> 39:47.220
All right

39:47.220 --> 39:51.980
So I I cannot wait for this game, but they're saying that the Japanese version is getting a sequel

39:51.980 --> 39:53.980
We don't know about American yet, right?

39:54.220 --> 39:58.500
No word on the u.s.. Yeah, but you know if it's coming on Japan. They're gonna translate it so

39:58.500 --> 40:03.860
Well, I mean they didn't really translate oh and on they kind of gave us a whole new version

40:03.860 --> 40:09.020
That was I think better, but you know depends. What kind of music you're into anyway Eddie is dying over here

40:09.020 --> 40:11.580
He wants to share some wee news that wasn't on our show roll

40:12.700 --> 40:15.660
Yeah, there's there's an unconfirmed rumor on the internet

40:15.660 --> 40:22.860
Which is always reliable that Nintendo is gonna come out with sensor ankle straps so like you can kick and dance and kick

40:23.860 --> 40:25.780
That's that's a bunch of bullshit

40:25.780 --> 40:30.220
I think that'd be odd like it even if it's not sure like if it was true. That'd be awesome. That'd be so cool

40:31.380 --> 40:33.380
Can anybody say Sega activator?

40:34.580 --> 40:37.060
Sega activator that's pretty easy I

40:37.980 --> 40:43.900
Think that'd be cool. I don't know like you could like run and jump and do it and do it

40:45.860 --> 40:48.100
SSJ 100 man chat says that's fake

40:48.100 --> 40:53.340
Oh shot down ouch

40:56.500 --> 40:58.500
Sweet

40:58.740 --> 41:00.740
Dead air I

41:01.900 --> 41:08.780
Just wanted to point out though a Loki the Nintendo fanboy train is going by and you know you're not on it oh

41:08.780 --> 41:24.380
Oh sick burn Rob. Come on Loki get on the wee fanboy train. That's why we don't give him like a fucking soundboard because we'd have stuff like this.

41:25.660 --> 41:30.740
No, yes, because no Loki actually is a Nintendo. He likes Nintendo. I went over to his video game party

41:30.740 --> 41:34.700
It was like all Nintendo pretty much. I mean so he's not against Nintendo come on now

41:34.700 --> 41:40.380
I'm picking up and you know SSX blur next week, and that's gonna be awesome. I'm really looking forward to that

41:40.980 --> 41:42.980
But to be honest you know

41:43.380 --> 41:45.500
There's a lot of games that are coming out

41:45.940 --> 41:49.420
And mostly by Ubisoft so fuck you Ubisoft because I hate you

41:49.980 --> 41:53.460
That are just fucking ports of shit. I mean

41:54.260 --> 42:00.620
Stop releasing like old-ass games under a new title because they're on the portable systems now and on the Wii

42:00.620 --> 42:04.980
You know it's just a port of some old game that was out before listen

42:04.980 --> 42:09.260
It didn't sell well the first time stop trying to port it over to get some more sales out of it

42:09.420 --> 42:13.780
Especially do we do we really need another port of driver parallel lines?

42:13.780 --> 42:19.900
I mean wasn't it bad enough the first time and now you have to enhance it with some better control

42:19.900 --> 42:25.260
What about the dude that was with what IGN or something that got quoted in some blogs as we saying guys?

42:25.260 --> 42:31.580
Oh my god something really cool. He needs a diet of fire. Okay. That's stupid Matt Casamani or whatever

42:31.740 --> 42:35.860
I've got secret news. I can't tell you about it, but it's so over cool

42:35.900 --> 42:39.620
You're just gonna be so amazed when you hear about it, okay?

42:39.620 --> 42:44.460
Well that could be anything that could be anything and the fact that you come out and say I got a secret

42:44.460 --> 42:48.980
I'm not telling you though. I got a secret. You're gonna. Love it. It's so cool

42:48.980 --> 42:55.500
Mm-hmm uh-huh why the fuck okay? Why the fuck is he posting that in his blog in the earth?

42:55.500 --> 43:00.820
You know the other thing is why the fuck are people posting it in their blogs like say dude

43:00.820 --> 43:05.660
Did you hear the guy from IGN he heard that there's news coming? That's cool

43:06.460 --> 43:09.180
And did you fuck is that oh my god?

43:09.180 --> 43:12.980
You guys Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is coming to partner net but you didn't hear it from me

43:12.980 --> 43:15.100
That's that missed our show world to you know

43:15.100 --> 43:21.300
I'll think yeah that even though we're not supposed to talk about it. Do Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is totally a partner net Rob

43:21.300 --> 43:25.700
What is this like the same guy that was the t-shirt dude from two weeks ago?

43:25.700 --> 43:30.940
I like your t-shirt thing maybe wow that's pretty crazy because you do the voice exactly the same

43:30.940 --> 43:36.820
That's my that's my uniform straight male voice actually oh wow you do really well. Thank you. You're welcome. You know rice princess

43:36.820 --> 43:41.980
I'm just give me a beer and maybe a pie bitch. You know I'm gonna say you know other stuff a lot of stuff

43:41.980 --> 43:45.180
That's on partner net that people go and report about it's not really

43:46.220 --> 43:52.220
Surprises, it's like stuff. That's been in development stuff that a lot of people already knew about so and the fact

43:52.220 --> 43:56.260
I don't I don't know if you guys read the fine print on your NDA's

43:56.260 --> 44:03.500
But uh you're not supposed to talk about partner net and I hope that God that whoever keeps leaking this shit because it's not

44:03.500 --> 44:11.040
Really, even a story. It's just like guess what I saw that that jetpack game that they've already announced is on partner net

44:11.040 --> 44:18.360
Wow, you didn't announce the game. You didn't give me any details about the game all you said that is you're confirming something that they've already announced

44:19.360 --> 44:26.720
Wow, that's awesome. Guess what Wario aware smooth moves. It's in stores now. I just confirm something that they've already announced

44:28.240 --> 44:30.240
Give me my own blog

44:30.720 --> 44:34.240
Joshi 16 says attention Loki. It's all about attention

44:35.280 --> 44:39.920
Let's see what else is there here and Nintendo maniac 64 says breaking news

44:39.920 --> 44:41.920
There's news coming

44:43.040 --> 44:45.760
GS68 says Loki a free speech anyone

44:47.040 --> 44:49.240
Fine, but I don't have to listen to them

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
All right. Well anyhow

44:52.720 --> 44:54.680
We should move on to another story here

44:54.680 --> 45:00.600
And this is like this ongoing saga like I thought we would have talked about this once on the show

45:00.960 --> 45:03.160
laughed and it would be done with and I'm talking about

45:03.800 --> 45:07.040
Level 30 and you know when I say level 30, I'm talking about

45:07.040 --> 45:08.800
Yes

45:08.800 --> 45:14.120
It's like do you want to know how far down the rabbit hole goes? Well, it's actually level 30 and that's about it

45:14.120 --> 45:17.140
Well, here's the thoughts there. What's very interesting?

45:17.140 --> 45:23.280
Is that not only when you get your replacement bubble bobble revolution that will let you go all the way to level 31

45:23.720 --> 45:26.480
You get a free copy of Rainbow Islands

45:27.040 --> 45:31.760
Revolution because I didn't even know there was a Rainbow Islands revolution

45:31.760 --> 45:37.600
I did and I actually played the old-school Rainbow Islands. I still play it today on game tap

45:37.600 --> 45:42.640
And I could care less that there's this DF version out and if I'm a Rainbow Islands fanboy

45:42.640 --> 45:46.960
And don't give a shit about this DS release. I can't imagine there's five people who bought this game

45:47.440 --> 45:52.400
Therefore you're getting this free game because nobody else wanted it. They have extra copies sitting in a warehouse

45:52.400 --> 45:58.720
So does this atone for their sins is all well with Codemasters now because they gave you a free game

45:58.720 --> 46:02.360
I mean you gotta say they didn't have to do that. Let me just put it this way they should really fire

46:02.360 --> 46:05.720
They're marketing people because that cover for bubble bobble

46:06.280 --> 46:09.880
Revolution or whatever looks like crap. I mean those dinosaurs look

46:10.480 --> 46:15.360
They gain like a thousand pounds or something like Jenny Craig anyone

46:15.520 --> 46:17.720
There's a nice little letter that came with it

46:17.880 --> 46:22.660
Please find and closed a replacement for your defective bubble bobble Nintendo DS cartridge

46:22.660 --> 46:25.720
You should find that you encounter no problems when playing this new version

46:25.720 --> 46:31.400
We would like to apologize for the problems you've had with this game and hope that the need to swap the cartridges did not

46:31.600 --> 46:35.880
Inconvenience you too much. We have enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island

46:36.700 --> 46:40.640
Also for the Nintendo TS, so there's only one so oh great. Oh great

46:40.640 --> 46:47.360
So I got you know I my bubble bobble wouldn't go to level 30, and now there's only one goddamn island in Rainbow Islands

46:47.360 --> 46:55.160
Hahaha, okay wait. You know we've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island. You know why they included Rainbow Islands, right?

46:55.800 --> 46:58.400
Because bubble bubble really only goes up to 31

46:59.040 --> 47:01.560
So they're like oh you're gonna be done after 31

47:02.280 --> 47:05.680
Yeah, because I work for them anyway

47:05.680 --> 47:08.960
I know this we've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island as

47:09.320 --> 47:12.960
Consideration for the length of time that you had to wait for the new cartridges to be manufactured

47:12.960 --> 47:18.680
Please dispose of your faulty cartridge by simply putting it in the trash or local

47:19.040 --> 47:23.000
Recycling facility where one exists you know why it's called Rainbow Island

47:23.320 --> 47:26.760
Because they didn't finish the rest of the levels and you're gonna have to send it in

47:26.760 --> 47:30.020
No, you know what you need to fucking do with that replacement cartridge

47:30.680 --> 47:32.680
Return it to your local GameStop

47:32.880 --> 47:37.440
And get some money back because they're not gonna know the difference they got it come on

47:37.600 --> 47:41.760
They're not dumb enough to buy it. Yeah, they are way. They can tell no they're not

47:41.760 --> 47:46.820
Okay, fine. Take it back to your local whatever used game store all right well

47:46.820 --> 47:51.680
Uh stories about bubble bubble revolution going on four weeks in a row make me very angsty

47:51.680 --> 47:55.640
And I don't know about you, but that makes me want to bring on the pain with the FUs of the week

47:55.640 --> 48:16.560
A dark soccer is not here tonight. I will put in a preemptive dark soccer FU to traffic and people with how she's busy with massage school and all that crap all right Loki what's your FU tonight?

48:16.560 --> 48:19.640
I don't really have an FU, but I'm gonna take this moment to

48:20.360 --> 48:22.920
Let everyone in on a huge secret

48:22.920 --> 48:28.040
There is some uber huge exciting news

48:29.520 --> 48:36.360
Coming soon, and I tell you once you hear what this news is it's gonna fucking blow your mind

48:37.080 --> 48:41.060
It's so amazing. I really wish I could tell you, but I can't

48:41.720 --> 48:43.720
You know NDA's and all

48:44.880 --> 48:49.980
I like how they follow the NDA's when it comes to that news, but when it comes to everything else it is kind of wet NDA

48:49.980 --> 48:52.940
You know why cuz there's no news

48:54.300 --> 49:00.060
This is the same guy said there's fucking halo on the Gameboy Advance. I mean come on. Oh my god. There is oh

49:00.980 --> 49:03.240
My god burn your Gameboy eyes princess

49:06.300 --> 49:08.300
Unsubscribe all right uh I

49:08.860 --> 49:15.820
Would like to give an FU to whoppers the original malted milk balls because they are so addicting and I think bro

49:15.820 --> 49:20.780
I remain in a bunch of them when I wasn't here so FU to that don't steal my whoppers when I'm not here

49:21.260 --> 49:23.260
Give me my malted milk balls

49:23.700 --> 49:25.700
How dare it bitch?

49:25.900 --> 49:28.500
How dare you take my malted milk balls Eddie?

49:29.380 --> 49:34.580
I'd like to say an FU to all the garbage that I've been keeping in my closet because I'm moving and I have to throw

49:34.580 --> 49:38.840
It away now, and I'm like ah it's taking forever, and it's horribly bad

49:39.740 --> 49:41.740
FU garbage in my closet

49:41.740 --> 49:46.460
What else do you have in your closet nothing rice princess

49:49.100 --> 49:52.060
FU to the auction house on Elder Thallus because

49:52.660 --> 49:59.180
You're stupid, and you'd never have good leather head here that I need for my Twink

50:00.380 --> 50:02.380
Yeah, let's do few more poo-poo

50:03.380 --> 50:05.380
Yeah, what the hell does that even mean?

50:05.940 --> 50:08.700
Let's do more poo-poo. What does that even mean?

50:08.700 --> 50:12.860
It's supposed to be like get off the game and go shut up for a second. I'm kidding

50:13.060 --> 50:15.280
It's supposed to be less pew pew more pew pew

50:16.060 --> 50:20.000
But I call it less pew pew more poo poo because it's funner to say

50:20.780 --> 50:24.940
What does even pew pew mean like shooting like pew pew?

50:25.180 --> 50:29.620
But what if you're a warrior you don't really shoot then punch yourself in the face. Why the fuck are you playing a warrior?

50:30.340 --> 50:32.340
Warriors in lane

50:32.540 --> 50:34.700
Playing a rogue or a hunter anything else

50:34.700 --> 50:41.460
And that's it like you style. Do you have anything you wish to I contribute a few the Taco Bell because it makes more poo-poo

50:42.620 --> 50:44.620
Yeah, more poo-poo less pew pew

50:45.140 --> 50:47.140
in that case

50:47.980 --> 50:49.980
You know you

50:52.460 --> 50:54.300
Speaking of

50:54.300 --> 51:01.040
Things that are pretty poo-poo in my opinion alien Hamed is coming to Xbox 360. Sorry. I did not like alien Hamed

51:01.040 --> 51:05.020
I are hominid or whatever the hell it is. What's alien Hamed alien Hamed? It was a game

51:05.020 --> 51:10.460
That was out on the PlayStation 2 no. I know what alien hominid is it's a flash game. It's not that great

51:10.460 --> 51:13.900
I don't know why people are like so freakin excited and ecstatic

51:13.900 --> 51:17.740
I mean I suppose yay indie development and all that stuff, but I'm not gonna buy it

51:18.380 --> 51:23.980
But whatever alien hominid HD is confirmed to be the game coming to Xbox Live Arcade this Wednesday

51:24.540 --> 51:30.380
Because Xbox live talked to one up and somebody spilled the guts because everybody always talks to one up because I don't know I think

51:30.380 --> 51:35.020
They pay people to talk probably yeah, so they get that

51:35.540 --> 51:41.700
So there you go and also hopefully boom boom rocket and wing commander are in the near future

51:41.700 --> 51:46.300
Oh boy. I'm sure we have a story on that later. Don't we Loki?

51:46.900 --> 51:54.860
Yes, wing commanders coming to Xbox live arcade wing commander arena and nobody cares because it looks like shit

51:55.500 --> 51:57.860
I don't know if anyone's seen the videos out there

51:57.860 --> 52:02.780
But the wing commander that you've known and loved or maybe didn't like

52:03.500 --> 52:07.980
This is certainly not the same game in fact. This is as much wing commander as

52:08.500 --> 52:10.900
Nova drone was Twisted Metal, so I

52:11.780 --> 52:18.820
Don't know, but anyways if you're interested. It's 16 players online and you can battle each other might be cool

52:19.780 --> 52:21.300
No, well come on

52:21.300 --> 52:26.380
I mean even though the game did not look like wing commander like if you've seen the little game preview somebody took the wing commander

52:26.380 --> 52:32.500
License and put it on some like random space shooter game, but 16 people come on. That's got to be fun

52:32.500 --> 52:38.280
What's novadrome fun with 16 people novadrome? No, you're right novadrome was just like a fun game at all anyway

52:38.280 --> 52:42.180
So it is coming out. It's going to have you know up to 16 players

52:42.180 --> 52:45.180
They're going to have free-for-all maps dueling maps team maps

52:45.740 --> 52:47.660
blah blah blah

52:47.660 --> 52:49.340
and

52:49.340 --> 52:51.140
Yeah, it's great

52:51.140 --> 52:53.140
There's videos online YouTube

52:53.140 --> 52:56.860
I'm game trailers comms check it out and be disappointed

52:58.220 --> 53:04.340
Apparently boom boom rocket is really anticipated by a lot of folks in chat room that looks fun. It doesn't fun

53:04.340 --> 53:09.420
I love see I like DDR, and I did like fan of vision so our old buddy

53:09.420 --> 53:14.140
Mel B's in chat and says it's like dance mania speed meets fireworks. That's a boom boom rocket is

53:14.980 --> 53:16.980
Well, that's all I want to say I want to see a

53:17.700 --> 53:21.060
Video of that emotion we see screenshots, but screenshots only tell you so much

53:21.060 --> 53:27.180
You know that would be kind of fun to play Def Jam icon of dance mania speed as the custom soundtrack in that

53:28.260 --> 53:32.380
Any game with a dance mania speed is the custom soundtrack is sure to be hilarity

53:34.020 --> 53:39.460
Something that's not funny is my Xbox 360 it makes too damn much noise whenever I'm playing it and

53:39.740 --> 53:42.900
apparently though there is a rumor going around because you know when when

53:43.660 --> 53:47.700
Websites that are foreign release news. It's just the case this German website

53:47.700 --> 53:52.900
It's only a rumor the the u.s.. Websites won't believe it until Microsoft

53:52.900 --> 53:58.740
I can't read it well, whatever, but anyway um it certainly sounds like it could be a possibility a German gaming website

53:59.140 --> 54:03.100
When it was it called things in a might not dear Sinemite

54:03.100 --> 54:05.380
I don't know they they announced that

54:06.020 --> 54:12.740
Microsoft has done a software update for debug Xbox 360s that reduces the speed of the DVD drive

54:12.740 --> 54:19.820
Causing the noise to go down, but the drive is slower than yeah, but did it need all the high speeds

54:19.820 --> 54:21.320
I mean, I would ask well

54:21.320 --> 54:26.400
Don't you think the update is smart enough to know hey when you need the high speed use high speed when you don't need it

54:26.500 --> 54:30.940
Shut up. They don't really care. How loud the DVD drive is cuz me be honest

54:30.940 --> 54:35.120
I don't really notice mine when I'm playing games, and if you're gonna be wrong sitting there going damn

54:35.120 --> 54:38.500
My drive is loud, then you're gonna die. I'm gonna be honest

54:38.500 --> 54:42.460
I do notice it especially when you boot the system like when you boot and you're starting a game

54:42.460 --> 54:47.940
That's when I really noticed that I'm like goddamn is my Xbox 360 gonna launch into space cuz it makes so much noise

54:49.820 --> 54:51.820
It's gonna just blast off through the roof

54:52.700 --> 54:55.540
Don't you think they make up? Maybe it's just cuz mines vertical standing

54:55.540 --> 54:59.900
I don't know I think because yours on is on a hard surface and so it transfers the sound

55:00.180 --> 55:04.100
But I mean if you put it on carpet like I have mine right now

55:04.100 --> 55:08.260
I was playing on my monitor on my computer and so I have it sitting on next to my

55:08.260 --> 55:12.100
You know normal PC, and I don't really hear it. I mean I

55:12.500 --> 55:16.780
Don't know, but then again. I have headphones on and I'm listening to the music and stuff so

55:17.380 --> 55:19.100
but

55:19.100 --> 55:22.300
Whatever. I don't know. It's not a big deal for me. I mean if it was like

55:23.260 --> 55:26.340
Like the whole time when you're playing it then that'd be a little different, but

55:27.300 --> 55:30.580
It would just be really weird if it was that. Unsubscribe clicks you were getting.

55:31.180 --> 55:36.620
Throughout the world. So it's not a huge deal though. It's not like like a chainsaw sound or something like that

55:36.620 --> 55:40.220
I don't know it people just need to quit bitching

55:40.900 --> 55:46.580
Speedy F40 ouch ears GS 68 Loki WTF alpha canagram damn Loki

55:48.300 --> 55:50.500
It's better etc. Loki needs a sedative

55:50.500 --> 55:55.900
I was gonna say Eddie was making fun of me calling my wireless headset a wireless communicator at one point

55:55.900 --> 56:00.740
But I wanted to say during my gaming week. I bought one of those $20 things you can put in your computer

56:00.740 --> 56:04.420
What's about the gaming receiver or something like that so you can use your wireless headset?

56:04.420 --> 56:10.860
It's awesome because I can use my wireless headset on ventrilo and it what I didn't have to do any configuration my computer

56:11.140 --> 56:16.180
Ventrilo just automatically new and like the voices come through on the ear and you can talk with the heads

56:16.180 --> 56:18.940
It's great. It's just buy a bunch of this and I'll do the show

56:19.980 --> 56:23.200
It's too bad Rob cuz the ventrilo server doesn't work anymore

56:23.260 --> 56:30.420
So you've never gone and Rob puts on a red mini Ohura skirt and goes all hailing frequencies open captain for lovin

56:30.420 --> 56:36.020
You know even understands that nobody from Star Trek thousands of listeners of orange

56:36.020 --> 56:41.300
I'm sorry hundreds of listeners after tonight of action. Actually, maybe 20 listeners more time after tonight and

56:42.260 --> 56:44.260
Not a one of them is gonna understand that

56:45.580 --> 56:47.580
All right

56:47.620 --> 56:54.780
Anywho, well one thing that's never quieting down is these stupid rumors about mill yourself for on the 360 and

56:54.780 --> 57:01.420
And yet another one kind of flaming or fanning the flames of this rumor. There's apparently a

57:02.300 --> 57:09.100
kind of a survey going around asking people of their interests and mill yourself for on the Xbox 360 and

57:09.460 --> 57:13.380
Questions like would you like to see mill yourself for on the Xbox 360?

57:13.380 --> 57:16.500
Would you buy an Xbox 360 just to play mill yourself for?

57:17.060 --> 57:24.220
On a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 being not at all satisfied and 100 being very satisfied

57:24.220 --> 57:28.540
How would you rate Konami's output on Xbox 360 to date?

57:28.540 --> 57:35.180
Well, that would be a big fat crap because and also on this survey. Do you like candy?

57:35.580 --> 57:42.780
Do you like money because it's Captain Obvious's survey, of course people want to see Metal Gear Solid on 360, right?

57:42.780 --> 57:46.320
I mean more games the better like you saw you're shaking your head. Why not?

57:47.980 --> 57:50.500
Because I hate the Xbox 360

57:50.500 --> 57:54.020
Basically, thank you. Why do you hate the 360? I don't hate it

57:54.020 --> 58:00.620
I don't hate it, but it's not as good as is like a DS or we sign reasons titles

58:01.100 --> 58:03.100
That's what matters. Yeah

58:03.300 --> 58:08.220
360 he's got a lot of shit coming out. I mean, I don't know a lot of it's good, you know

58:08.620 --> 58:10.620
exclusive titles boom boom rocket

58:11.060 --> 58:14.220
Well, I'm like boom boom fire booboo dollar

58:14.220 --> 58:21.420
No, I'm gonna get one only for the mist Walker titles cuz I'm a big og Final Fantasy fanboy dragon

58:21.420 --> 58:25.500
Yes, blue fucking dragon dragon looks awesome. And so does lost Odyssey. So

58:27.540 --> 58:33.940
Lost Odyssey's a ways off. It's not hopefully it won't be a lost cause

58:36.140 --> 58:40.860
No, but anyways this comes from apparently an evil avatar forum post so

58:40.860 --> 58:46.740
I take that as rumor, I guess to be honest. I don't believe that this such survey exists, but you know

58:47.180 --> 58:52.100
Evil avatars another all-game show so we got a I'm just saying but this is like a listener

58:52.100 --> 58:55.060
This isn't exactly you know, but whatever I mean

58:56.060 --> 59:02.460
It's possible that they're do they really need to ask people what their interest is in mill yourself for I mean, that's like

59:02.460 --> 59:05.380
Yeah, I'm like, would you like to see halo 3? I

59:06.420 --> 59:08.060
mean

59:08.060 --> 59:09.900
It's dumb

59:09.900 --> 59:14.100
Shadows lair says my god a survey amazing. It's confirmed. I

59:14.860 --> 59:18.460
Think it was a little bit of sarcasm sarcasm there speaking of obvious

59:18.820 --> 59:24.580
It sounds like crackdown 2 is already being greenlit and that gets a big fat duh as well

59:25.100 --> 59:26.260
I

59:26.260 --> 59:31.620
Mean, maybe maybe it'll contain the halo 4 beta in the that was the joke that yeah, I read that

59:31.620 --> 59:34.820
Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah, I stole a joke from whatever the site of QJ or whatever

59:34.820 --> 59:37.620
But I mean come on didn't take a lot of brains come up with that joke

59:37.620 --> 59:40.740
Cuz isn't that the only reason why crackdowns really selling a halo 3 beta?

59:40.740 --> 59:44.220
I think a lot of people are actually buying for the game because it's a fun game

59:45.140 --> 59:46.500
It's a lot of fun

59:46.500 --> 59:51.320
And I mean if it were just for the halo 3 beta then you wouldn't see a lot of people

59:51.320 --> 59:56.200
you know playing the game right now because a halo 3 beta isn't out this by the way comes from a

59:57.420 --> 01:00:03.880
Interviewer with senior designer Steven in Netta when he gave a review to computer video games simply this magazine

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:11.120
He mentioned you know was what he would put in a crackdown to which you know obviously a more believable

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.240
Functioning city the city makes the fun

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.660
I think it comes to how you can choose how you choose and approach your missions and so on and so on well the thing

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:24.020
Is about crackdown and the even and we're talking about when they were designing the game originally

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:30.560
They've made it to where they can add islands and add whole extra parts of the city that aren't in the full game right now

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:37.040
Later on so this game can expand almost as much as like oblivion can so

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.680
You know I hope they go that route

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:46.320
That'd be really cool chat room is shooting down the whole halo Chi stand corrected apparently a ddr dollar bill says I like to crack

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.880
down fuck halo 3 beta Jeremy Todd once is I could care less about the halo 3 beta crackdown as amazing as a game and

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:57.520
Ddr dollar bill confirms again crackdown is more fun than fucking halo. I mean don't get me wrong

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:03.240
I'm gonna play the halo 3 beta because I'm gonna you know be able to play the halo 3 beta, but I

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:09.120
Don't know. I'm not too excited about it. I think it's just gonna be everyone's gonna be I think disappointed because

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.360
There's been a lot of people who have done it really good so far

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:19.960
And there's not really much you can innovate on and this you know big secret X button crap or whatever that is

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.180
I don't think it's gonna be that big deal, so whatever we shall see anyways

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:31.780
So another thing that's gonna be shown pretty soon is gonna be Xbox 360s IP TV

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:36.860
service, and they're actually showing it at the connected home show at

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.320
Well in Europe of course some brand new

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.180
show down there and

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.420
Looks interesting not really too much

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:51.640
You know they don't really go into any details on it, but I guess it's gonna have you know DVR stuff in there as well

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:57.680
Anything that gave me more TV channels. I'm all for so you know I can't wait to check this out

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.880
Hopefully you know they start you know having some

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.540
You know I want a DVR anyways because I don't have that currently with my cable subscriber, but

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.080
Hopefully, it's not all like MSNBC or something like that

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.200
I'm curious about it. I don't like the fact that you have to switch everything to do it

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:23.520
I'm not gonna switch everything just to have TV on my 360. Yeah, I mean apparently it's gonna be taking place

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.600
So um the connected home show and that's March 5th through 7th in Olympia, London

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.080
I'd like to see some youtubage of it in motion I

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.360
Don't know anyhow something else very cool announced to the Xbox 360 price cuts for the games yay

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.040
Actually not all the games

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.480
It's the platinum hit series

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.560
But you know we all like news on a price cut and actually a lot of those are already price cut so I've already been

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:53.340
Price cut yeah, they just saw the new packaging well supposedly March 16th is the day that the new packaging will come out

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.340
But it sounds like a lot of retailers have been proactive

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.200
Whatever you drop the price well for the low low price of 30 bucks

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.120
You can get battlefield to burn out revenge Call of Duty 2 dead or alive 4 fight night round 3

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:10.620
Ghost Recon advanced warfighter topspin 2 or Rockstar Games table tennis

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:15.160
Which I seem to recall only cost 39 in the first place yeah, so it's not much of a price cut

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.860
But um and topspin 2 sucks balls don't buy it

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:24.040
But some of those other ones that a lot of very popular such as Ghost Recon is pretty popular Call of Duty 2 about

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:30.160
Battlefield and so on I'm pretty sure folks will be all over that all you need to know that just means that those used games

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.580
Are going to drop down even more so just buy the used games especially if they're that old. There's no point

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.800
Japan's getting some extra games in there well actually they only get battlefield

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:48.280
But burnout but chrome hounds as well and perfect dark zero and other regions in Asia also get 99 nights

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.680
Which should be interesting chrome hounds?

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.640
I do believe is already dropped down in price in the United States as well, so I mean

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.520
You can probably find that if you really keep in mind if you want to have the best tanks in the game or whatever the

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.400
Best mechs whatever you call them you have to buy extra stuff online

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.480
Just wait for armored core 4 because this is the game that you should have bought in the first place anyways

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:15.000
And you know I was a sucker also bought chrome hounds thinking. Oh, it's gonna be just like armored core

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.960
It's like armored core with like anchors being dragged behind you. It's so

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.200
slow and

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.320
Boring armor core for it's the way to go um anyways

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.240
There's another rumor that's been confirmed this week

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.960
Mercenaries 2 is coming to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.880
Despite the fact that this is kind of news that everybody already knew about since you know

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.960
There was like you know some shots that they were talking about the game and stuff, and there was 360 dev kids behind them

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.320
I mean

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.600
It's like a big duh so that game is gonna be coming out mercenaries if you don't remember

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.960
Originally believe was put out by Lucasarts, and it was one of those games that you can I remember the commercial actually for it

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.520
They're all you know you know shoot people blow stuff up blow stuff up again

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:06.120
You know it's it's kind of one of those sandbox type of games where you can just cause a lot of mayhem

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:10.280
Cause a lot of mayhem, so I will definitely be checking it out

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:19.040
And except for fall by the way a game that I will definitely check out is Elder Scrolls 5 because you know

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.040
there's gonna be one on the way and

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.800
Elder Scrolls 4 was obviously an amazing game on

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.960
Bethesda has confirmed Elder Scroll 5 will happen. It's definitely going to happen

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:35.480
There's no immediate plans right now according to the studio's vice president of PR marketing Pete Hines

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:41.520
but what else is interesting is that he says the possibility of an MMO is kind of a

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.480
natural step for the series

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.240
very interesting

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.760
But what's interesting about that?

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:55.800
It's been bounced around according to Heinz, but they will not move forward with it unless there's a fresh idea for the MMO genre

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.760
But dude, I think opening up oblivion as an MMO would you know or that type of game is an MMO

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.400
It's good enough

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:06.240
Don't you think I mean God on that multiplayer patch hit most people were like this should have just been in the game to begin

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.920
With it's gonna be crazy though. It'd be interesting. I

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:15.760
Don't know. I can't wait. I but you know you're not gonna see this game until like

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.120
2009 at their earliest I mean it's going to be at the it's gonna be when people are talking about

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:27.920
PlayStation 4 and Xbox 720 whenever that you know happens or the fuck else they're gonna call it. Yeah, we'll see

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.040
anyways

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:36.600
So with clover being dissolved some of the members of course went on to create the brand new company seed

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:42.280
The other members stick are stuck around and are now working for Capcom. Well. What are they working on?

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.440
you can be seeing them working on Resident Evil 5 for one and

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.440
Of course a brand new Wii game as well

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.920
So it's kind of nice to see you know clover because I know they were

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:59.760
Doing a lot of original IPs and stuff and kind of you know throwing that kind of creative side to Resident Evil

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.320
5 and

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.120
Hopefully this Wii game. That's pretty awesome, so

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.600
Pretty sweet, huh?

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.520
Interesting I so I guess clover not as far gone as you know some people think well

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.680
They're gone, but it's just they've kind of you know

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:19.240
It's it's like you know if you buy a company or something like that a lot of times

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:24.400
You'll dissolve the company and just say okay, whoever wants to move over. We'll pay you to move over otherwise

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.280
Find a new job. You know it's kind of like that all right pretty much keep the same people, but

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.680
Yeah, you know the talent, but you don't have to carry

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:38.240
You don't have to pay for the you know the spot you know the lease or whatever you're just cutting costs that way so well

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.380
That was the last story we had paid for part a but we're actually running a little early tonight

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:45.160
So um I think we'll actually go to the skype line and take some calls

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.280
I covertly open up the skype line there and saw if we get any calls

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.600
So we'll get some calls out of the way early a little bit tonight because we're running early tonight

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:57.640
So hi you uh you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? How you doing sky? I'm speedy f40 hi speedy f40

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.900
I don't recognize the name you must be a new listener

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.640
I'm not a new listener

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.460
Because I've been listening to the podcast forever

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:13.120
Awesome brand new on the stream though well welcome welcome to the first show I guess live show is the first live show you doing

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.520
Then yeah first live show I'm doing I've popped my orange launch cherry tonight

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.800
sweet

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:24.300
Congratulations. Yeah, was it hot was this was it as good for you as it was for me

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.540
I I'm sure it was probably better for you because I tried harder

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:33.640
But I mean I'm sure it worked out for everybody all right speedy. What kind of games you into well right now. I'm playing

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.620
Rebels Alliance, I don't know Star Wars deadly Alliance or something for the PSP because I got it through gamefly

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:43.400
And it's mildly entertaining, but uh I plan some wow

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:51.280
And some Wii games even though I got a topic for you. All right. What's up? I think the Wii is overrated oh

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.240
Gasp you're on Loki's side tonight you so you are not on the train tonight with everybody else

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.120
You're you're not on the Wii fanboy train. Yeah

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.840
God

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:11.400
Just kidding. Yeah, I'm not on the fanboy train. I think that the Wii is completely overrated because

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:16.300
Okay, I think it's just about a more of a party system a fad system if you will I have a Wii

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:22.700
I bought it the day it came out, and I'm missing I'm missing my gaming experience. I've been going to the PC more and more often

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:29.820
But you know what's interesting do you think the Wii is going the way of the GameCube because I even I love Nintendo

01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.020
I would have paid the GameCube very similarly although you had some phenomenal games on GameCube

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:40.180
You know Resident Evil 4 it was mostly a party system your Mario parties your Smash Brothers melees. You know it's a party system

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:45.340
I don't think it'll go the way of the GameCube because it has that quirkiness, and it has games like oh gosh

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:50.960
Wari aware which is a really fun game definitely kudos to them from doing that one

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.980
But I think that a serious gamer would be better off with the Xbox 360

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.220
So you don't think you know the uber-cool

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:04.620
Metroid or or no no the uber-cool super secret thing the IGN guy won't shut up about you

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.380
Don't think that's gonna change your mind

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:10.460
No, I don't think a DVD drive or anything like that's gonna change my mind at all

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.980
See I totally disagree because on the Twilight Princess

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.980
I think that was a perfect marriage of

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:20.900
Classic sort of old-school styling with combining some of the Wii elements to make it more immersive

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.860
Oh, give me a break Twilight Princess sucked

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:29.260
It was not as good as it could have been that was developed for the GameCube, and it showed definitely show

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:34.840
Yeah, but I think it's just I think it showed that the that the it can do a classic style game and still be awesome

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.160
It could do a classic style game when it's a freaking port

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.420
I think that the Twilight Princess was entertaining because it was Zelda

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:48.600
But I don't think it was any better than any other platformer could have been there was no huge breakthrough

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:56.800
You know our chat room very polarized on the same topic JB Mon says Twilight Princess was overrated shadow next gen says I love Twilight Princess

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:03.760
JB Mon also says Twilight Princess showed fanboys will love anything. You know what I like Wind Waker a lot better

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.920
I'd be honest what you're smoking crack. I liked Wind Waker. I thought we'd make a Nintendo

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.640
I am on the Nintendo train, and I didn't even like Wind Waker. I liked Wind Waker

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.680
I thought it was a fun game the only good

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:21.200
I was disappointed about Wind Waker is once you know and this is a spoiler once you go under the you know the ocean you

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.080
See oh, it's Hyrule. You know I was like well

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.200
Why the fuck did they just not make it like a remake of you know?

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.160
You know link to the past or something like that with that kind of style

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.120
I mean from the person who was criticizing Nintendo early in the show for doing too damn many remakes ah

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.040
Okay, honed no. Here's what I'm saying though

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.180
I don't necessarily want to do an actual remake

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:45.600
But I just wanted to actually be in Hyrule instead of in the ocean

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.660
I mean because I would have rather had you know more land and stuff like that and run around like that

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:52.800
I don't mind the art, so I thought it was kind of different

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:58.160
You know you got used to it, and it kind of worked. It's just and then now I'm playing you know

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.480
Twilight Princess, and I lost interest in like an hour, so

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.400
Same here loki same here. I don't get it. I don't get why everyone is a 10

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.900
Did you play through the whole game though Twilight Princess? Yeah? No? I look like yeah?

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.120
No, I'm sucks that you're gonna play through it. No yeah, no the first

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.280
I mean the story doesn't really start developing right away, though

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.240
I mean once you get into it. I mean it's like it's the first it to me

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.320
It's the only true sequel to ocarina of time. I mean once you get into it like it's it's really cool

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.840
They start touching base with all the old ocarina of time. I didn't even care about ocarina of time though. See that's it

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.720
Oh, wow, so you're not even a Zelda fan then all right well the beautiful part of orange lounge radio

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.280
Is that everybody is entitled to their own opinion even when they're wrong?

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.340
Exactly all right well a speedy anything else you want to share with us tonight

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.200
Well, do you mind if I do some shameless plug-in? Oh?

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:51.120
They'll cost you a dollar okay. You know I could send it through PayPal. I know it's fine get of course

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.720
Oh, what's way? What are you gonna? What do you unplug?

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:58.440

Okay, I don't hate the Wii. All right. I know I know it's like the DS was when it first came out

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.360
There's a lot of games just like yeah, who gives a shit, you know Nintendo got a mash

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.960
Yeah, no, but you know, it's a third party

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.740
I'll agree the third party games on the Wii do kind of sucks by the time. It'll be good. Yeah

I should give that a plug search for ol army. We have another call higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:25.000
Hi, this is Alex kid from a former Sega fame. How you doing? Hi Alex kid

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:32.120
Wow, I'm really sorry to hear about your career. Whatever happened to you. Oh, well, I retired in 1990 and rather I didn't retire

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:39.160
I got fired by Sega. They wanted to bring in that stupid fucking rodent sonic. Uh-huh. Think you're all familiar with him. Yeah, are you better?

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:45.760
At all about that. No, cuz see here's what I think. I think he's only had one good game in the past five years

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.160
I think

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:52.040
It's high time that Sega brings me back. Do you think so bring it back all the classic stuff with Nintendo?

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.240
Why don't they bring me back? Have you written Sega?

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.160
Have you talked to your people to talk to Sega's people about I think a class to come back

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:04.280
I I've been writing them for years and I you know, I had a restraining order like six years ago

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:09.080
But that's that's expired now. I should talk to you know be world after them. I mean what they'll happen. I

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.640
don't know like

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.440
Shinobi world was like the last thing I ever did and

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:22.080
Then they just threw this hedgehog at me and I couldn't well damn it. I mean, I mean Alex kid you

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:28.000
Alex kid you sure you certainly don't know how to play this really bad at this game Alex kid

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.920
Um, you didn't have blast processing

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:38.240
No, but I mean look look I could go on the 360 and sell 10 more 10 times more copies

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.680
Which would be 10 copies of the Sonic the Hedgehog game?

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:47.520
All right, well 360 Alex kid is there a way we would see you on a virtual console at some point I

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:54.240
I I don't know. Oh, I'd like to I I'd started writing in Nintendo and I started telling them, you know

01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:00.720
Bring back those master system games because nobody played them because your system kicked up kicked our systems ass. What happened there?

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:06.000
Why didn't you go to Nintendo if that's where you're feeling the love Alex? Why didn't you go over to Nintendo?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.280
Do you know at the time it was a?

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.480
Hiroshi Yamauchi and he gave me the finger and

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:18.120
And you know, I don't know don't you mean he gave you rock and you had scissors?

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.040
Hahaha

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.760
Shut up. I

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:29.280
Mean seriously Alex. That was the worst part of your fucking game who thought of putting rock-paper-scissors in a video game

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.960
I hey, I'm gonna spend money on a video game so I can play rock-paper-scissors

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:40.400
Did you ever play tech mobile? It's the same fucking thing. It's fucking rock-paper-scissors kid. You got a dirty mouth

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.240
I'm gonna walk. Yeah, I know so, you know what this I'm giving it back to my buddy DMN. Hold on

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.720

Sorry about that guys. Oh wow you

Hey, you kind of look like Alex kid without glasses. It's amazing. Yeah, what's on your mind DMN? Um, nothing

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:10.980
He Alex kid came over wanted a call. It was frightening. Oh, so I can hang up on you then

I was like, oh I'm taking pity on these poor guys who had this little crap show. I'm gonna know I'm kidding

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.360
STFU is great, obviously, you know, what what be sure to make fun of you like ten times the amount of my soccer con show

Let's said that wait. Wait, who said that funny Dale? Okay. Hold on a second here. No kicking funny Dale because you disagree with him

01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.660
Huh? No kicking funny Dale because you disagree with him

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.840
Okay

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.560
The Rob D says I believe Derek H said he's too straight to listen to olr

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.600
Whatever

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:16.680
If you don't know what we're talking about or is the reference to one of our sister programs all games interactive

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:21.100
Brother sister inbred cousin whatever you want to say. I'm too straight to listen though

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.840
DMN any quick thoughts we're gonna take one more call before we take a break here. Um

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.480
You should play luminous live because it's pretty fun. It's $20. I

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:35.480
Know but I have luminous or not luminous live. Sorry luminous plus I have luminous on xbox 360

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:40.480
I don't need it luminous plus $20. All right, that's your $20 you ever spend you're wrong, but have a nice day

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:45.200
Anyway, you're wrong. Shut up. All right. Ah, I love hanging up on him one more call

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:52.920
We'll go over here. Hi. Hello to you too. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's a share

01:19:52.920 --> 01:20:00.120
I say show what's on your mind buddy? No rice. I finally got final fancy 12 rice princess cheering over here

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:07.000
You finally that's right fall fancy 12 finally made its way to the UK shores this week and

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.080
Thank you for not still it spoiling it because it's fucking epic

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:16.160
I it is it is fucking epic in every system where you've probably actually played more of it than I have because my friends stole

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.200
It there's one of my one of my friends will only play Final Fantasy games

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.040
It's the only games he'll play and he took my PlayStation 2 when Final Fantasy 12 came out. Oh,

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:29.360
Should be more for that. All right. Well, uh, you gotta take a moment to sell the you know

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:34.920
The listeners who feel that orange lounge radio is too gay for their tastes then Final Fantasy 12 probably is too

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.920
So sell our listeners on orange our sell sell our listeners on Final Fantasy 12 if you would

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:47.960
Um, get it because it's like epic and if you play Final Fantasy 11, you'll love it because

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:53.040
It's just fucking it's Final Fantasy 11, but with an actual story

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:57.200
I guess rice princess made a face because she hates Final Fantasy 11

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:02.480
I hate 11, but I love 12 because and there's a bunny lady named Fran

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.760
She can look at her butt. So that's why you should play the game

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:11.360
But Maury in our chat room says fucking epic is now my new phrase of the week

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:16.440
Today's secret word every time you hear the secret word screaming out

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.640
All right, so that's all you've been playing as fun as 12 non-stop

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.160
Pretty much. How is the cosplay over there when the game came out?

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.960
Did you go one of those midnight parties with the cosplay and all that stuff?

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.860
Um, I went to my local Astra midnight and I was like two people queuing up for it. And that was it

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:39.020
I was quite shocked. Don't you love how they call it a queue?

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.220
Is he gonna go into battlegrounds? No

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.260
No, we're just teasing

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:51.300
Anything else going on in British news that we are might be overlooking what hey, I got a question for you

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:57.900
What's a game that still hasn't come out over there that we have over here? That's pissing you off. Was there anything? Um,

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:00.860
Supernova

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:08.140
Dance Dance Revolution supernova. Oh, yeah dancing stage supernova cuz heaven forbid I say revolution in a British territory

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:15.760
But oh, that's I don't know I could well why else don't they call it Dance Dance Revolution over there? I don't know

01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:21.900
Anyhow, um, well, they're really they have a completely different song list right station one. So I don't know

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.580
Did they call it Dance Dance Revolution on PlayStation 1?

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.140
Yeah, that's weird first mix

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:31.300
What don't you get it like in two weeks? Like it's really close to coming out, isn't it? I

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:35.860
Think so, but I don't know if that's a real release date

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:38.900
We're getting a DDR

01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:44.500
Universe next week and I'm pretty excited about that. Yeah, I'm very excited about DDR universe

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:49.260
So dancing stage universe should be making its way over there. I mean soon enough. I imagine

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:53.860
Alright, well say sure we got to end our part a here and get into part B, but thanks so much for your call

The phone lines will be open again in part B

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:24.180
So, please don't get your panties in a bunch that you did not make it onto the show

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.540
Because the phone lines will be open to get in part B. We just had a little extra time

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:31.380
We want to make this part an hour and a half. So there you have it some phone calls

01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:33.500

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:51.700

01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:01.500
Of one of the hosts of orange lounge radio rice princess would be a good one to pick on cuz she'll bomb it

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.420
She'll get one she eats rice

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:09.140
All right, and I will tell you how you can be the listener that battles them very soon a little bit later on

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:12.880
