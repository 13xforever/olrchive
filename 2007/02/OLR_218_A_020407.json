{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco. Tonight, February 4th, 2007. First-hand accounts of the newest Konami games from their Gamers' Day event. Denver Live goes straight from theaters to video to the internet. And did Windows Vista break your favorite PC games? Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number 218 for this, February the 4th of 2007. My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Yo. How you doing, Jamie Summers? I'm doing. Yeah? Been an interesting week. Been an interesting week? Yeah, I could say the same. It's been a very interesting week. We'll get into that in a minute. Say hello as well though to Tech Master Loki. Hello. How you doing, Loki? I'm doing good. Did you have an interesting week as well? Yes. Alright. Well, for those of you that are new to our program, we just want to say hello and welcome. We were lucky enough to have a story of ours on the front page of DIG this week. So we're thinking we might have got a couple new people thanks to that. So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a big howdy hello to you. Thank you for choosing to support independent podcasting, first off. And just so you know, we're a show made up of three friends who have kind of become friends to each other just through doing this program. We sit here and we talk about games every week and the way that you would sit down and talk at a dinner after you've gone to an arcade from a long night of playing DDR or Tekken or Derby Owners Crack, whatever it is that you play at the arcade. Just kind of sitting around and chatting like old friends. And sometimes we're lucky enough to break news here first because we have some inside contacts thanks to Loki being in the distribution world, among other things. But sometimes we're not always going to break the news. We're just going to talk about it and give you our viewpoints on it. We're dedicated to giving every gamer a voice and we do that partially through our chat room as well. A big hello to the chat room. Joining us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com when we tape live here on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time. Also we have our Skype line which we'll open up later in the program. It's also an 800 number you can give us a call at and share your thoughts. We'll open that up later. So that way all you guys have a voice. All right. And of course tonight they're talking a little bit in chat room about the Super Bowl which is going on right now. But I guess between the three of us we kind of don't really keep tabs on what's going on in the Super Bowl. But I will say the Puppy Bowl was awesome and I'm kind of sad I missed the kitty half time. But the Puppy Bowl is kind of boring. But the Puppy Bowl is cute because they have the bowl. I like the bowl cam. You know what? They need like a Madden for puppies. Would you buy Puppy Bowl the game? There was a Japanese TV show that I used to have a few copies of on tape. It was called Uri Nari Land and they had dog soccer and baby soccer and cow soccer. The closest I've come is Mega Man soccer I'm sorry to say. I was thinking the Puppy Bowl would be something like that and it wasn't. It was cute but it was just three hours of cuteness. Puppies playing. I was sitting in here working on some last minute things for the show and I just hear out in the living room dark soccer and my roommate going. That was your roommate that was not me. No it was you. Puppies. It was both of you. All right, well let's get into the game stuff. I was on my ass in this chair, playing Tech in Dark Resurrection on PSP, and I'm gonna get Dancing Blade, because I played the old one, and that was pretty cool. I actually did not play any Cooking Mama this week. Are you in a 12-step recovery program? No, I'm in a, oh my god, my midterms are next week type of thing, so I've been studying muscle groups. Well, I guess if I went back and played some Trauma Center, I'd be okay for class or something. I loaned out my copy of Trauma Center to a friend of mine who just got a Wii, so I'm sorry to say I don't have my version for you to practice on, but that's a fun game. So fun. I like the Trauma Center. I've actually gotten pretty good at some of it, but it's still frustrating. Can't I just rub them until they're better? So yeah. That's really doing it though. Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week? I played more of the Crackdown demo, like, another three or four times yesterday. I love that game. I just can't wait for the full thing to come out. You know, it's one of those games that I was like, well, you know, because everyone was saying, oh, it's kind of the demo, they didn't like the demo or anything like that originally when I was first hearing about it. I was kind of like, well, you know, I don't know if I'm gonna like this. I actually like it better because you can actually explore a lot more of the city. I did climb to the top of the tower in the middle of the city, which is fun, difficult, and a little bit, you know, a little bit frustrating at times because, you know, if you fall off that thing, you're pretty dead because you're falling like 50 stories, but it's cool because once I climbed to the top and I had like 10 seconds left, I jumped to my death trying to land on another cop because that was funny, but yeah, it was great. And then I tried out another demo, actually NBA Street Home Court, a little bit different of a type of game that I'd normally play, but it's pretty cool. It actually looks really good. All the screenshots are definitely pretty accurate of how the game is. It's pretty cool, kind of reminds me of NBA Jam a little bit because, you know, the players are doing stuff that you would normally not see anyone doing in basketball, but it's pretty fun. It's not a game I'd be picking up, but, you know, definitely a fun game. I really wish NBA Jam would just come back, you know, because NFL Blitz is kind of lame. You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but NBA Jam was definitely one I could get into. That game was a lot of fun. It really was. I just love the old NFL Blitz, but this Blitz League shit's retarded. Some comments from chat room regarding your comments on Crackdown. Jeremy Todd 1 says, the grenade launcher in the Crackdown demo is so freaking awesome, you can literally just keep blowing everyone up with a single button push. Flying flaming people equals automatic 10 out of 10 score. Mr. Gohan wants to know, how did you get up there? Jeremy How'd I get up there? Climbing. Seriously, it's just climbing, you know. If you keep climbing up the side of the building, you'll eventually get to this part where it's kind of flat, then on one of the ends of the three towers, they have, like, scaffolding. If you jump on the scaffolding, you can kind of make your way up a little bit more, but you really need to have, like, you know, at least a third level on your, you know, jumping and stuff in order to be able to reach some of that, but you can get pretty high. It's pretty fun, and it's even more amazing, too, when you get that high, you can still see all the cars and people walking down below. I mean, that's pretty amazing, you know, compared to, like, Saints Row, which, you know, you wouldn't see any of that stuff, stuff would be glitching out and stuff, but I can't wait. I can't wait for Saints Row 2 whenever the hell that comes out. Crackdown! That's going to hold me over for a long time. Hold you over until what? Oh, Grand Theft Auto? Is that what you're waiting for? Oh, yeah, Grand Theft Auto IV. Anything else? No, actually, oh, I played Luminous a little bit, I beat some, I got some more achievements playing the time attack stuff, and I think that's all I played, yeah, that's it. Alright, well, my gaming week wasn't too thrilling because I'm still in my World of War Crack mode, so I'm still playing there with the guild, which, by the way, if you're interested in joining our guild, we have a few OLR listeners in there that I've been playing with and chatting with, it's fun. I was just on there about an hour before we went live tonight, and if you want to join, there's more information on our forums, it's orangeonsready.com, click on forums, right now we play on the Ravencrest server on the Horde side, for the Horde, anyway, it's fun. So a lot of people are making their Blood Elves over there because it's a newer server. But anyway, outside of War Crack, not a whole lot of other games per se, but I did finally check out Xbox 360's movie marketplace, because when it first launched, there was really nothing I wanted to see, but then they added a bunch of Lionsgate movies just like a week and a half ago, it's kind of like the artsy, well, sometimes, sometimes they have big budget films like Saw, and I guess The Descent was kind of up there, but usually it's like kind of artsy films. So there was a film on there that one of my friends had seen that said I'd probably like called Hard Candy, which I decided to download in HD, just because I wanted to see how was the HD delivery and everything, and well, the movie itself was kind of weird, I mean, I guess it was good for like the first 40 minutes, then it was just like WTF, it was kind of gross, but anyway, outside the movie, I mean, I realized that Microsoft can't do anything about that, the quality wasn't too bad, I thought it was kind of weird, because when you first start watching the movie, it actually continues to download the last portion of the movie, so you can't really rewind or fast forward or any of that stuff for the first little bit of the movie until I was about an hour in, then it finally finished downloading the rest of the movie, so I could rewind, fast forward, whatever, and basically, once you download the movie to your hard drive, you have 14 days to start watching it, and then, once you press the play button and start watching it, you have 24 hours to finish it, which you know, if I'm going to sit down and watch a movie, that was certainly ample time for me to finish it, but just so you know before you download any of that stuff, picture quality because I downloaded an HD was pretty good I don't know if HD gives me anything that much more than DVD does I mean yeah it's a little crisper yeah the colors stick out a little more but is it worth essentially six dollars that I'm paying to download the HD movie to watch one time I don't know I don't know I might be better off just getting the HD DVD player and getting a Netflix I don't know yet so it's hard to tell too because hard candy wasn't exactly a movie with lots of bang up special effects and things it would be easier maybe if I downloaded something like Poseidon that might have more of that I don't know but it wasn't bad I would use the service again because at least it wasn't having the slowdown problems that the store did when it first launched whatever I guess maybe the curiosity factor is settled down a lot and things it's easier to get in there and download movies now so I I would recommend if there's a movie on there that interests you you want to see how it looks download one try it for yourself why not I also downloaded for free because it was for free for a couple days the first episode of the Sarah Silverman program which is hilarious but the audio is off a little bit as it because we also take my roommate taped it on the DVR and then I was like oh we can download it'll be like perfect quality and while the video quality was great the sound was off I don't know if that was me or what the hell was going I don't mean the sound was muted but the sound was like you know when the sound is like just a hair off of the lips it just bugs the hell out of you because it looks like you're watching an old karate movie or something yeah yeah it's bad so maybe it's just my copy of it I don't know whatever going to the chat room and seeing what the folks are saying there in the chat room let's see black boy says God Shelley winters in HD no not that not the old ass Poseidon adventure I mean the new one who then what the new one have in it it had was that guy it's in them got it can you remember his name who's the guy that's a snake in revenge of New York or whatever oh that's carousel carousals in it that's what it is Mike W says that Rob is a movie snob yeah maybe a little bit I don't know Mike W says Rob like only plays Xbox Live Arcade yeah lately that's what I've been playing there hasn't been a whole lot released on discs that I've wanted to play but I enjoyed heavy weapon I love luminous I love the Xbox Live Arcade it's like those little little throwaway games with a little like because I have gamer a DD if you've lived in the show long enough you know that I never stick with one game for a long time with the exception of the few MMOs I've played and even then I quit and go back and quit and go back all the time so Xbox Live Arcade games are perfect for me but I do want to check out fusion frenzy which is kind of the same thing it's like 40 minigames in one but it's an actual release game as opposed to Xbox Live Arcade and I'm definitely looking forward to some of the Xbox Live Arcade news we have coming later in the show but first we're gonna get into the show tonight we have a no housekeeping news of notes there's no changes or anything going on with the show so we'll just take this opportunity to give a few of our other projects a few plugs we want to say you can catch us on all games radio if you want to hear part A and B together and a bonus segment that doesn't even go to our audio blog or podcast feed you can only hear that when you listen live to us Sunday nights at six o'clock or our rebroadcast on all games which is currently Monday at 530 Pacific and 9 a.m. on Tuesday Pacific time at all games calm although I hear those times might be changing in the near future we'll let you know the details that happens also we have a myspace so if you have a myspace if you want to come join us where the internet goes to die myspace the Antichrist of the internet it's myspace.com slash orange lounge radio what we have another community that's what we have our live journal community and what else what am I forgetting deviant art is there deviant art community we have a few communities thankfully there's a frapper there's the frapper we have our forums too oh what I already plugged the forums okay fine fine then I'll plug them again orange lounge radio.com my god people it's not hard it's fun and we read them and respond a lot I have more posts on the forums than anybody probably Loki and dark soccer are up there too not me not you why aren't you participating in the forums you hypocrite I'm not a hypocrite I'm babysitting I see all right well let's get into some gaming news and we're gonna start it off as I mentioned at the top of the show we were very lucky to have our coverage of dance dance revolution hottest party hit dig this week so thank you guys very much for giving us a dig on there and as we reported we were lucky enough to attend Konami gamers day earlier this week and we'll tell you more about it throughout the rest of the show here but of course you know since our show started many years ago as a Bamani DDR music game type station we know a lot of our longtime fans are very interested in this title and heck even some of you guys who've come to listen to Orange Lounge Radio when we just tapped into gaming in general you still can understand the dance dance revolution is really up there it's the top if not one of the top maybe next to guitar here I don't know music game franchises that people really follow so I think a lot of people expected the DDR was going to come to the Wii it was just a matter of time I don't know about you I wasn't expecting to hear it this early like I kind of thought we would see it maybe like doesn't seem still early in the Wii's life for us to be getting this game I don't know maybe maybe so I was surprised at the timing of it I thought we wouldn't hear anything about it till at least e3 if not 2008 but it looks like we are getting it this year at least a cool point because it's not gonna be another PlayStation 2 version this year I would think I don't know they didn't show one off so that would that would imply that but I don't know there's a lot of stuff they didn't show off economy gamers day so they didn't say anything about Metal Gear Solid 4 except kind of cock tease us with a release date and then not say anything that was stupid they knew they knew me soon I was like that's such a they knew we all wanted to know it they didn't say anything about Silent Hill origins I'm wondering if that game got cancelled cuz coding on it's still it's still like it's pushed back that's for sure Silent Hill now Silent Hill 5 was the game I was thinking we were gonna see I cuz you know though we're gonna get a Silent Hill 5 at some point the first four games are phenomenal there's the movie and everything duh we have to get a Silent Hill 5 at some what nothing I think economy gamers dating up about Silent Hill 5 doesn't that make you sad dark soccer because I was looking forward to Silent Hill 5 not really why because that sort might leave it to a much bigger announcement coming up later ah so you think Silent Hill 5 is worthy of a press conference all on its own why not okay fair enough maybe when they announce the sequel to the movie I don't know well anyway a three new songs in DDR hottest party lips of an angel gonna make you sweat and will buy a Naoki what's interesting with that is that the teaser trailer teased that it was a brand new soundtrack from the ground up and so it's kind of interesting because you have this lips of names are gonna be sweat and then there was a weird cover of breakdown in there yes I remember both of myself and Mel B we right when the trailer annual that was a really weird version of that song it's like what the fuck was that and they talk about a soundtrack spanning four decades worth of music so I'm wondering if this isn't kind of like the direction we're gonna see for the soundtrack an all-new soundtrack of like remade songs of the last four decades along with a few economy originals like this will bow Naoki uh-huh we'll see it was interesting a little demo now of course it's on the ween you gotta wonder how's the Wii remote gonna be used and yes you use the Wii remote in the game they add a little basically I think this is more of a concept build what we were looking at at this at the show because it basically looked like DDR supernova but blue and then like every so often an arrow would be replaced with this little icon that kind of looked like the Wiimote and then uncheck the other cause symbol kinda it looked kind of weird and you that was just your indication of shake you could do anything you want but they were very I mean Jason Enos who's like the producer for this that was there demo in the game and he said this is he emphasized over and over again this is a very early concept thing we just want people to know it's coming we're still really experimenting with what the we thing is going to do by the way I want to mention something I didn't post anywhere on the site since Jason Enos was there I took an opportunity to ask him a couple questions and I asked him I said so how about DDR in the arcade and anything you want to say about DDR in the arcade and he of course didn't really have anything to say I said what about that rumor there's an expansion coming to supernova with you know the 20 30 20 30 or more songs he said he didn't know anything about it which could be the polite way of saying no comment I don't know but rest assured those rumors that you've seen floating around the other DDR sites Jason says you don't know about it so that's what I'm going with I'll trust him that's interesting that is I was reading there's some rumored release dates and I haven't heard anything about this yet but that was it that stupid Codemasters dance factory game was gonna be coming to the Wii in March before DDR oh interesting but I mean I can tell you right now the games could be ass just because the last one is ass I'm looking at some comments from chat room Jeremy Todd once says Silent Hill origins is now the next Duke Nukem forever god I hope not jaded says Silent Hill there won't be a five I doubt that those those are big where there's got four sold pretty well didn't it I'll see why there wouldn't be a five all right Rama says DDR supernova 2 in the groove dream on dream I'm sorry I've been following the Bahmani scene for a long time in the groove songs are not is not coming to DDR and I I don't I don't have any insider knowledge to back that up granted but just having followed Konami in the biases as long as I have it's not happening stop getting your hopes up about it because you're gonna be disappointed I'm sorry not happening once that ruling passed in the groove was officially dead so anyway that away from that back to DDR on the week that's what we really want to talk about yeah what I thought was interesting is the selection screen you could use the Wii remote to like point-and-click at songs you wanted to play and it had a cute little DDR arrow icon I don't know just it's a long memory right now yeah I'm sure I'm sure what did you think look because you actually got to play it what did you think actually playing the game did it feel right was it weird it was like DDR hands and feet mode but it's just it's it let me put it this way the hands and feet mode was awkward this is just as equally as awkward at least as it is right now and it's not it's just it doesn't it's almost like it doesn't need to be there just because you know you supported the iToy you don't need to have a hands and feet mode in that although the thing is though if they do something like this they could do some really interesting stuff with it like instead of you know have a whole section of the song that's all done with your hands I mean that might be kind of cool that's what Jason was kind of implying that they might want to do things where you do different motions like he referenced Saturday Night Fever like the disco pose like there might be a symbol that you have to do that kind of pose and that they could do like what was in a samba de amigo that and that's what a lot of people are coming away from the saying is that it sounds like it could be DDR mixed with samba de amigo and I don't see any reason why that's not a possibility so I mean it right now it's just it's still way too early it is and you know that there's DDR with possible stuff I was able when I played it I thought it was it did feel like it played a lot like hands and feet mode because none of this extra stuff was in there but I felt it was a lot cleaner because the problem I have with the itoy is the device just sucks yeah if you're not in the exact right lighting it doesn't win that's not Konami's fault it's just the itoy sucks I'm sorry I've not played one good thing with the itoy not one and you have to have the exact right lighting to make it work and it never is right on DDR I don't know if you have a house where you can get it to work every time but the nice thing about playing this on the Wii was that it worked every time like it you you know it you don't have to have the perfect white background in your house to get the wiimote shaking to pick up so that's what I liked about it is that and it didn't matter where my hands or feet where I could kind of do it wherever so that was kind of fun so I I had fun with it and it certainly posed to I mean I was struggling on medium level difficulty songs you know so it certainly adds a whole new challenge to it which I'm sure the purists will not be happy about but DDR needs to evolve I did find it interesting though that all the dance pads were just the GameCube dance pads I think you know in speculating that DDR was going to come out on the Wii I wondered how they were gonna do the wireless pad without lag and it never occurred to me duh just use the GameCube pads because there's GameCube controllers on the thing and looks like that's what they're doing because that's what in the trailer you could see clearly that even the non Mario pads they use in the trailer were just plug in yeah the GameCube slots anyway just really quite wanted to quickly say about DDR Wii before we move on also it's going to feature an updated battle mode a support mode where I know they talked about they really want this to be the family DDR they want this to be the game that mom dad kid brother sister all play together and they they're gonna have a mode in this where you actually talk to each other and you have to do the same pose at a certain part in the song they know they want that in one type of mode so you have to communicate with each other say okay we're gonna disco we're gonna disco whoa we're gonna sprinkler Roger Rabbit I don't know whatever so that's gonna be interesting I think if nothing else now also free play mode and work workout mode no sign of edit mode but I don't see how you couldn't have a DDR right now without edit mode so I don't see why that wouldn't be coming for those that want to edit the Wii things into it yeah it's way early it's probably just a technical issue for right now so if you want to see more on it we even have some pictures we took some pictures of the trailer which hasn't come out anywhere else yet and there's a picture behind the scenes there you can see Jason a demoing it for some girl from some unknown press site who's giggling over it you see all that on our site and we have the only picture of the interface as it is now but that's going to change the interface is going to change that was obviously a temporary interface but that's all at orange lounge radio.com if you want to see more information on that so Loki what what else did you see economies gamers say that you enjoyed there's actually quite a few games there and I got to try a little bit of everything one of the first games I tried was time ace which in the preview kind of reminded me of time pilot because you're playing in kind of different time periods and you're flying planes and stuff the game itself actually reminded me the graphics remind me of prop cycle I don't know if you remember that old arcade game I freaking love prop cycle that's like one of the most underrated arcade games ever it reminded me very much of that it weren't you big on prop cycle Jamie I remember you looked at an M car K when it came out yeah the prop cycle is a bomb and you fan yourself I played it for free I love so much anyway sorry anyways but on the game kind of reminds me of at least the level that they had you try out where you kind of playing this biplane thing to be honest the game itself could very much be wing island on the DS I mean you're just you know doing different missions you're fighting you know planes in the air I mean it seemed pretty solid you know graphics are a bit rough but I guess that's you know that's just a DS for you what is it you were saying something about you thought this was a sequel to time pilot I thought it was a sequel to time pilot that's I mean it makes it time ace time pilot meaning both of them are biplane games where you're fighting in different you know time periods it seems logical to me and interesting I just know I for some stupid reason to not make that connection I don't know I just thought that's you know what they were doing I could be wrong they could just be kind of a something that's almost identical and has almost the same name whatever another game I did play though was coded arms contagion for the PSP and I can tell you having played the first one it still sucks and you know it's very unfortunate because it looks like they really tried to make the game load better it's just unfortunately for the PSP first-person shooters just suck on the PSP and that's just because they don't have two analog sticks it's really hard it's real sluggish to move around if maybe if they increase how fast you turn and stuff in it might be a little bit better but it's just those four face buttons using as like a second analog stick it's just not good at all that's really unfortunately a problem with the system but you know the game itself looks pretty good I mean it's okay I just I didn't have very much fun with it but you know what can you what can you say yes if you're used to playing you know first-person shooters on the PSP then great maybe one to check out definitely a good thing that they didn't do the random levels like they did the first one but it kind of reminds me like a Metroid Prime type game Dewey's adventure I know we saw the video of that looked okay kind of reminded me of Kirby a little bit actually reminded me of one of their own titles it reminded me of the Koron Koron I can't say that Korin pa Korin pa I can't say that word it reminded me of Korin pa kind of like in the way that you tilted the environment around but yet with this additional angle of changing the temperatures to change Dewey from a liquid to a solid and from a solid to a gas and what were they saying something about like when he's in solid form he damages enemies more but he's more difficult to control when he's in liquid form he can't really damage enemies but he's easier to control and then when he's in gas form he just kind of goes wherever he just but he can't really do anything else it's very interesting the way you change temperature and it's supposed to change the environments completely so it's a nice thing you can actually shake the controller certain ways to you know cause earthquakes or to like cause wind and stuff like that so that's kind of unique for a platform game. When they were about to announce Dewey\ufffds Adventure and they were showing the trailer and everything and they didn\ufffdt tell us what the name of it was yet, didn\ufffdt you think we were about to see Elibits 2? I totally thought that\ufffds what was coming. The cut scene for the artwork is exactly the same. It\ufffds the same style, they got the same people that did all the arts in Elibits to do this game. It even had glowing creatures that were small. All they\ufffdre doing is remaking Elibits all over again. But then when we actually heard about the concept, it was nothing like Elibits at all. No, it\ufffds not. But I kind of thought it would be interesting to keep it in the same universe but just have it be a different thing, because it\ufffds almost like the same art style. I could see it later on, they\ufffdre having a box set from this guy, it\ufffds like a bunch of different stories that are kind of in the same universe because they all seem to be told the same way with really bad dialogue over the entire cut scene. It was cute. It was cute. But yeah, it was okay. There are tsunami props for original stuff with that in Elibits and everything. How easy would it have been to have just ported Castlevania to the Wii where you use the Wii as the whip? Whoopee-doo! But they\ufffdre coming up instead with original things for the Wii, which I think is kind of cute. But I want a Castlevania game where you use the Wii as the whip. I know we all want that. We don\ufffdt need it right now. We have this other Castlevania thing to look forward to we\ufffdre going to talk about in a minute. We don\ufffdt need another 3D Castlevania though. That\ufffds true. Castlevania 64 still burns a little bit. Hey now, we have 3D Castlevanias that aren\ufffdt that bad. But they\ufffdre not that good either. Castlevania 64 made my soul cry. Compared to Symphony of the Night, everything since looks like poop. I\ufffdm sorry. No, no, no. Compared to freaking Rondo of Blood, everything is poop. We\ufffdll get there in a minute, sweetie. We\ufffdll get there in a minute. I know. Well, Symphony of the Night was great, but it wasn\ufffdt a true Castlevania in my opinion. It was like Metroid featuring\ufffd Then fart in words. Then fart in words. Then fart in words. It was Metroid featuring the Castlevania characters. I\ufffdm not saying it was a bad game. It\ufffds one of my favorites ever, but it was Metroid featuring Castlevania characters. But it was the best thing I\ufffdve ever played, one of the best games I\ufffdve ever played in my life. And granted, I think the best video game ever made. I don\ufffdt know how many times I\ufffdve said this on the show, but I think the greatest video game of all time is Super Metroid. Dude, Metroidvania. And so of course I love Symphony of the Night. Junami said it best, though. Metroidvania. Whatever. Anyway. Anyway, so another game that wasn\ufffdt like Metroid, Hellboy, was actually pretty cool. It\ufffds kind of a beat-em-up type of game, of course, based on the Hellboy comic. It looks really good from what I\ufffdve seen so far, and they had one level that they were demoing there at the moment. And it was kind of cool. Definitely a lot of detail in there, and it\ufffds kind of cool you can go around ripping heads off of little demons and throw them at them and stuff like that, and the entire environment was pretty destructible. So I think it definitely looks like a better game, definitely a lot better than their last brawler that came out, so it should be good. The other one, Wing Island. Wing Island on the Wii actually could very well be a sister game to Pilotwings. It pretty much is Pilotwings from what I\ufffdve seen, and also once again kind of the same art style as Prop Cycle. Very simple graphics, but it\ufffds fun. You play a squadron of biplanes and you get a bunch of different missions from finding lost cows to delivering goods to putting out fires and stuff like that. So definitely kind of the same feel as a Pilotwings game. I\ufffdm looking at chat trying to answer some questions. Travis Donovan for Prez in \ufffd08 asks, \ufffdHow did Rob get an Elibit for his 360 Gamer picture?\ufffd You\ufffdre seeing a lot of people on Xbox do this now, and it\ufffds all thanks to the Xbox Webcam, and the way I got an Elibit is that I got one of the little stuffed Elibits from GameStop even though I didn\ufffdt pre-order the game, but I got that and I just put it up against a white background and took a picture with the Xbox Cam, because you can do custom gamer pics with the Xbox Live Webcam. I saw somebody else on my friend\ufffds list, I want to say Rob Way or one of our listeners has like a glowing Wii logo as his gamer picture. A lot of people are doing cute things like that. For a while I had a Mario Kart as my background because you can import themes from pictures on your computer, so you can do fun little customizable things with your 360 that kind of make you go, \ufffdWhat?\ufffd I haven\ufffdt bothered. I just have a perfect dark. That\ufffds fine. And the one that the public sees, because you only see the camera pictures if you\ufffdre on the friend\ufffds list, but what do I have? I think I just have one of the Pac-Man ghosts or something. I change it almost all the time. I change it like every week. It\ufffds like my MySpace. You got to change it all the time to keep it current. Rob, look. What? Oh, you have Pac-Man background on your phone. That\ufffds cute. It was a downloadable thing. Did you pay money for that? Yeah. I was bored. Loser. When I\ufffdm bored, I buy stuff. All right. Like most women. Hey! Hey, hey, hey. You\ufffdre mad because it\ufffds true. Can you stop that right now? Hey, hey, hey. Yikes. I just got a bottle thrown at me. You bitch. All right. Rob. Rob Hart. Bleeding. It bleeds for you. Bleeding black deafness from your heart. All right. Anyway, let\ufffds talk about Castlevania. This is something Jamie and I can agree on. They showed Castlevania the Dracula X Chronicles for the PSP. It\ufffds going to be our first Castlevania game that we have on the PSP. What\ufffds interesting is that elements of it are new, but it\ufffds still kind of an old game. Basically, what the Dracula X Chronicles are is that you\ufffdre going to have this old game, Rondo of Blood, which they said has never been in the U.S. before. Never. It hasn\ufffdt, but I can\ufffdt stop thinking about Castlevania V. Even though that game was ass, I mean, really, that game was like the worst Castlevania game they ever made next to 64. Well, yeah, but in Japan\ufffd Actually, I would rather play Castlevania 64 than Castlevania V. In Japan, by the way, it was released as Dracula XX. Right. Well, so they kind of\ufffd Or death\ufffd Or death, but I mean, after you got past the first stage, a lot of it was different, so it wasn\ufffdt really the same game, but in a way, it was. But anyway\ufffd I\ufffdm watching the trailer. That\ufffds as much as we got of Rondo of Blood previously. Well, now we are going to get not only the classic Rondo of Blood game on the PSP, but they\ufffdre redoing it with Upped Graphics, and that\ufffds what they showed\ufffd Oh, this is sexy. I know. That\ufffds what they showed at the show. I\ufffdm watching IGNs. The whole first stage was playable, so we got to play that, and it was awesome. Now, the thing you have to remember about Rondo of Blood is since\ufffd Did we redo the intro? Yes. It\ufffds all CG. But is it still in Gothic German? Yes. I think so. That thought. I think. It was hard to hear sound in there, but I think. Well, you remember, though, the show where I brought in my turbo duo and hooked it up and played it on air. That was in like 2003 or 2004. It was a long time ago. Yeah, that was a few years ago. Yeah, I remember that. I\ufffdll bring it back one day. But yeah, it was a sexy game. It looks great. I love, love, love the 2D with the 3D look. I mean, the best thing I could compare it to is like if you\ufffdve played Super Smash Brothers Melee and you\ufffdve played that mode where you like actually are in the Mario game, but it\ufffds like all 3D-ified even though it\ufffds 2D, that\ufffds what they did to Rondo of Blood in this enhanced mode. It\ufffds great. Okay, instant impressed points for me. The game mechanics are the same as 2D. Yeah, you can do the back flip. Not just that. I was checking the timing of the moves. They\ufffdre exactly the same as the PC engine. It did play a little weird from the Castlevania games I\ufffdm used to, but I understand that\ufffds because the controls handled a little different back then. Also something you have to remember, since this was before Castlevania the Night, you cannot just go anywhere you want. It\ufffds a little more like Castlevania 3 kind of with the branching. You can kind of branch off in different directions, but that\ufffds about it. Well, the whole point of the different directions, and I think that for people who aren\ufffdt familiar with Rondo of Blood, is that your ending is affected by how you play the game. You\ufffdve got secret hidden parts. For example, a lot of people were wondering who Maria was, who didn\ufffdt know any better. She was actually playable in Rondo of Blood if you rescued her, and all of her attacks were kind of stupid and cutesy little girly attacks, but they were also based after the four gods of Chinese mythology, which I thought was pretty funny. Oh, they redid the graphics for the Uber attacks in this game, too. Oh, yeah. It\ufffds nice. When you play the Saturn version, though, she has the same attacks, only just on a grander scale. Symphony of the Night will also be included. That\ufffds why this is the Dracula X Chronicles, so you get two versions of Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night for one game, and that\ufffds pretty awesome. Now, they\ufffdre not redoing the graphics for Symphony of the Night, but they tease the idea that they might add new areas. They\ufffdre thinking about going back and retooling that game, and I\ufffdm theorizing, why not give us the Saturn version? I mean, I realize you can\ufffdt really port the Saturn, but give us what the Saturn version had with Maria and that whole scenario. That would be awesome. Or the extra familiars. For America, it would be an addition, because of course we didn\ufffdt get the Saturn version, and as for the extra familiars, they were useless. They took them out for a reason, and I\ufffdm pretty glad that they did, because they were stupid. All it was was another one of the same thing that you already had. Dude, the item crash is hot. Ravens Dolphin says, \ufffdI thought Dark Sakura would be more excited about this.\ufffd Okay, when she first found out, I think I had to hold the phone about 10 inches away from my ear, because I was going deaf from the squeaking. Seriously, when I was watching the trailer, I sat there and actually thought to myself, \ufffdJamie\ufffds going to piss herself.\ufffd I mean, literally, because if you\ufffdve listened to this show ever since Episode One, Jamie never shuts up about Rondo of Blood, and what a great game it is. It\ufffds my copy while we were doing the show, remember? I do. Because I had gone to Anime Expo, and to put the long story short, my friend Krista owed us money for our hotel room, so she came back from Japan with a copy of Dracula X for me and called it even. She owed us about $120 and gave us the game. There you go. So I have a pretty copy of the game. Oh my God, this is so hot. All right, we've got to get to some other games real quick, though, that I got to play. Honeycomb Beat was another game I played on the DS. What I like about this puzzle game is it\ufffds kind of different from anything I\ufffdve played. It\ufffds not like anything on PopCap. It uses a stylus. Basically the grid looks like there\ufffds a puzzle mode and a progressive, you know, lines going up the screen mode. And basically when you tap the DS stylus on the screen, you flip over all the honeycombs around the one that you hit, and so that\ufffds kind of like how the puzzle works. You\ufffdre trying to make lines of solid colors. So it\ufffds one of those easy concept but repeat playability. Unfortunately there was no sound, so it\ufffds hard for me to judge, like, does it have good music? I mean, is this game called Honeycomb Beat? But it doesn\ufffdt really look like the music plays into it at all. I think beat is just what they call tapping the screen to flip all the things over. But I think if the price is right on this game, it could be a really good value buy, I think. It\ufffds a good solid puzzle game that\ufffds something we haven\ufffdt played before. What\ufffds also going to be a good value is Konami Classics. The full name of this game on the Nintendo DS is Konami Classics Series Arcades Hits, but we\ufffdll just call it Konami Classics. It\ufffds 15 arcade games. Essentially it\ufffds MAME on your DS. I don\ufffdt know a better way to describe it. Contra, Gradius, Circus Charlie, Puyan, like all these really, just frankly some obscure games. I remember Puyan because it was a game I played on the Commodore 64. But get this, all the actions on the top screen, but when you pause the game or you tap things on the bottom screen, not only does the bottom screen show you like the old arcade how to play banners, which I think is great, like those old things you used to see, like when you press the button, your thing will fly or whatever it is. You can also flip the top screen so that you can play in like brain training style mode, you know, where you\ufffdre holding the DS vertically. So for a more vertically oriented game like Puyan, it works great because you don\ufffdt really stretch the screen like you do if you\ufffdre trying to squish it into the more horizontal. So I thought that was a really smart idea. So that\ufffds going to be a pretty good value, although granted if you\ufffdre an Xbox 360 owner, a lot of these games you\ufffdve seen on live or probably will be seen on live a little later. So a lot of those same games, but you get them on the go on the DS. The next one I played is the game I can\ufffdt pronounce, Kororimpa, Marble Mania on the Nintendo Wii. Okay, you remember those old things they had back when we were kids, like those little marble mazes where you would turn the knobs left and right to move the marble around, but you didn\ufffdt want them to fall in the holes, like you tried to get it all the way to the end? That\ufffds this game on the Wii. You tilt the Wii remote to tilt the grid around, and so you could say in that sense it\ufffds kind of like Marble Blast Ultra because there\ufffds, you know, like things that get in the way. Like one round that we played had these giant scissors that closed on the course and you didn\ufffdt want your ball to be in there. And by the way, your ball could either be a little steel ball, you could be like a soccer ball, a basketball, or a little penguin ball, of course that\ufffds the one I had to play with. Not a monkey ball, that\ufffds a different game, I\ufffdm sorry, but this game is kind of like monkey ball I guess, but I actually felt this game controlled a little better than monkey ball did. I felt the controls were a little more polished on this game. So I think if it\ufffds released at a lower price point than your typical Wii game, I think it\ufffdll be a good buy. It has multiplayer, and what\ufffds interesting about multiplayer is you only need one Wii remote because one person uses the Wii, one person uses the nunchuck to control because you don\ufffdt really use buttons or anything, you just tilt the Wiimote around, which is kind of interesting. That was that game. And then Brooktown High was the last thing I played on the PSP, and Brooktown High is kind of a dating sim game. It\ufffds Konami basically trying to, what\ufffds that game they had in Japan, Tokenshi Memorial or what the, Tokimeki Memorial that they have over in Japan, this is them trying this in the U.S., because you know, Konami sometimes takes a while to try things out that are successful in Japan over in the U.S., like DDR, but this is them trying that. And I gotta be honest, I don\ufffdt know if this is something I\ufffdd buy, but I played another dating sim called Sprung, which is one of the most god-awful games I\ufffdve ever played in my life on the Nintendo DS, and this game was leaps and bounds better than that. So as far as dating sims go, it wasn\ufffdt that bad, but I just don\ufffdt know if it\ufffds the kind of game I\ufffdm into. I did like it\ufffds very customizable, you can kind of tell it, you know, what sort of girls you like and what your personality is like, and you can do a guy dating girls or a girl dating guys. Of course you haven\ufffdt seen the guys dating guys, but I hear it might be an Easter egg, but I didn\ufffdt get anything official from the developers of the game, but regardless, you can kind of get your character\ufffds personality built by attending class and by the dialogues you have. Like I know they were saying things about if you claim to be a philosopher to impress a girl, she might call you out on it and ask you a question about philosophy, and if you don\ufffdt know the answer, you\ufffdre kind of screwed and you lose cool points with her. So there are little things like that that are kind of interesting. And I also thought it was interesting that they had like booth babes there promoting Brooktown. It was the only thing they kind of went out and did all these little cheers. They really went all out for promoting that particular game at the show, which I thought was interesting. Yes, Dark Sakura. I\ufffdm totally cosplaying Annette\ufffds outfit. What, from Castlevania? Yeah. Thank you for having nothing to do with what I just said. No, I\ufffdm sorry. I was still looking at \ufffd they had some of the promo art up on GameSpy. Oh, that\ufffds fine. I played the Brooktown a little bit, and you know, the only thing that\ufffds disappointing is having played all the hentai, you know, dating sims out there. I did like \ufffd What? You wanted to see 16-year-old Titty? That\ufffds gross. No, no. I hope it had in the game \ufffd did you notice in the trailer they had kind of all the symbols for sex in there, like the rocket taking off and like the oil well going \ufffd Oh, yeah. I hope the god that\ufffds in the game \ufffd They did this weird-ass thing in the trailer where suddenly pictures of the game were replaced with these real-life imageries of a flower blooming and a rocket taking off and all this crazy stuff. I hope that like, you know, if you go in for a hot coffee or something like that, you know, that \ufffd This is going to be really random, but did you see the new Psycho? Like remember when Gus Van Sant remade Psycho, like in 1998 or something, he remade Psycho? One of the things he did in the death scenes, he added these random-ass clips that had nothing to do with it. Like when one person is getting stabbed, like you see a train going through a tunnel and like the clouds moving by in the sky and it\ufffds like all this random shit. That\ufffds what that reminded me of, I mean, seriously. Anyway, that was Brooktown. Is Chat Room giving you a hard time for being stuck on a Castlevania Dark Sakura? I don\ufffdt care. I did want to mention that Korinpa and Wing Island are both going to retail for $40 instead of $50. Oh, cool. You picked that up through your distribution thing because they didn\ufffdt say that at the show. Yeah, I picked it up, you know, I think I mentioned it maybe last week, whatever, but yeah. Other games at the show that they had, Death Junior Science Fair of Doom on the DS. I didn\ufffdt see it there. It was playable. It\ufffds just not a lot of people were playing it. Sorry, Death Junior fans. Go Pets on the Nintendo DS, which is interfaces with the PC. It\ufffds a DS and PC game, which I thought was interesting. It looked to me like a cross between Animal Crossing and Nintendogs. Jamie, you\ufffdd probably love this game. I might love this game. It looked interesting. The graphics looked a little rough, but it might have just been early stages. They didn\ufffdt have it playable, just the preview. Let\ufffds see, you talked about Hellboy already, right? Yeah. Lost in Blue 2. I didn\ufffdt like the first one. I didn\ufffdt care about the second one. Sorry. I played some of the mini-games, like the goat milking and the \ufffd no. It looks literally exactly like the first one. Lunar Nights, which we told you about at the F1 with Konami BBQ. It looks pretty cool still, and Winning Eleven Pro Evo Soccer 2007 looked awesome on the 360. That game looked \ufffd even on the PS2, it looked good. It looks awesome, but to be honest, I couldn\ufffdt get too excited about it because it\ufffds coming out next week. I mean, it\ufffds like, why even waste the space with this game? I mean, it\ufffds coming out next week. I mean, who cares? It looked good, though. I mean, it\ufffds really nice looking. I don\ufffdt really play a lot of sports games. I\ufffdm thinking about picking this one up. It looks that good. So, I don\ufffdt know. We\ufffdll see. Anyway, but we can\ufffdt end this story without saying something about the games that weren\ufffdt there. Of course, Metal Gear Solid 4. We thought maybe we\ufffdd see another trailer, a playable demo, maybe, but nothing, nothing. No Silent Hill 5, no Silent Hill Origins, no Coded Arms on the PlayStation 3, which means it is probably true that the game was canceled, we\ufffdre thinking, or at least heavily delayed. Silent Hill Origins on the PSP vanished into thin air, just like most things in Silent Hill. So, very interesting what they didn\ufffdt show as much as what they did show. What do you think about the lineup of Konami Gamers\ufffd Day overall, low-key, from being at the show? Make more console games. Stop with all the portable games. It was very interesting. Remember when the first marketing lady, or whoever was up there, and I apologize I don\ufffdt have my notes in front of you, she said something about that that\ufffds where all the money is right now. Is that DS and PSP? No, that\ufffds not exactly true though. Make some more 360 games. Granted, they had two last year. They had Rumble Roses XX, and then the follow-up Smash Hit Bomberman, two really awesome games for the 360, and then this year they\ufffdve got Hellboy, which Hellboy looks good, I\ufffdll give them that, and DDR Universe. But put some more games on the 360, oh and I guess Winning Eleven Soccer, that\ufffds great. So three games this year. I definitely don\ufffdt think we\ufffdve seen everything for the year though. This is what we\ufffd I mean, if you think about last year, we\ufffdve only seen what\ufffds coming out through like summer, except for some of the DDR Wii won\ufffdt be out until the end of the year, and some of those other ones, but most of the stuff is going to be out in summer. Most of what they showed was going to be out in March, and I think we already talked about most of that, but I mean, oh goody, so we\ufffdre going to see Karaoke Revolution, whatever the next one is, on the 360 come fall. SSJ100Matt says, \ufffdKojima probably wants to take his time with Metal Gear Solid 4 since it\ufffds his last one.\ufffd Yeah, he says that every time, dude. He says that every time. Bullseye is his last one. There\ufffds money to be made. He\ufffdll come back. Jamie, I know unfortunately you didn\ufffdt get to go because of school, but what do you think from the perspective of getting to read all about this? Are you excited about all this, or beyond just Castlevania? Dracula X. I really don\ufffdt care about anything but Dracula X, really. Nothing in the world. No Super Bowl, no Koro Impa. That one sounds interesting, but my excitement over Dracula X is phenomenal, monumental, bigger than a mole in terms of chemistry. The creator of Castlevania was there. I know it. I hugged him. He is still a fucking rock star. I hugged him. He came out and said, \ufffdI got a new hat.\ufffd Put on his new hat. I have a picture of him, remember? Yeah, I know. We ran into him in E3. I remember that. I know. I have all the celebrity run-ins. I want to mention some things that slipped under that most people didn\ufffdt talk about. There were some of the new lineups that they set for their plug-and-play stuff. One of them, which was really big and I\ufffdm surprised I didn\ufffdt pick, Music Mania, which I don\ufffdt know if it\ufffds Beat Mania or pop music or something, but they have a three and five key mode, and it\ufffds basically a music rhythm game. Even I missed this. It was on the CD with the press stuff. We\ufffdll have to do a write-up on that and look at that. What about the track and field? I thought they have a plug-and-go track and field guild, like a power pad, old NES type thing. Very interesting. I guess you could burn a lot of calories with that. That\ufffds what they\ufffdre encouraging. Speaking of burning calories and also DDR, there was a study going on by the West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency where they had, it was a 24-week at-home clinical study where they had people play DDR five days a week for at least 30 minutes and record their activity. They had to help monitors. They were tracking weight, blood pressure, arterial function, fitness level, BMI, and general attitude toward exercise. These studies came by, and see, all their studies, by the way, were above the 85th percent offer body mass index. Not all of them lost weight, but almost all of them were showing improved arterial function. They were showing general levels of well-being improved. The biggest thing on here, I thought, was confidence and self-esteem improved. They were more willing to participate in activity because they were so active and had more faith in their bodies and their capabilities. In other words, it took this big study to prove that exercise, no matter in what form it is, DDR or weightlifting or whatever it is, exercise is healthy? We know exercise is healthy, but I think that taking something that makes it really fun because in the average person's mind, I think, they're not going to see, oh, I'm exercising. I can tell you from personal experience, I get weirded out with the idea of going to the gym. There's something about that whole public sweating thing and the whole body builders. There's all those muscular people and everything. There's kind of that big fear that kind of goes with the gym and intimidation that comes with that. You don't have that when you're playing DDR because it's like just playing a video game. Even though there's a whole different side of it, like if you're playing at the arcade, people call you gay or whatever, but fuck them. It's about the fact that you're having fun with it. I haven't kicked out. I know. That was the good old days at Roseville Golf Land. We all used to go. But, anyway, DDR is kind of different than that. DDR is just kind of like having fun. It's like, hey, we're playing a video game, making asses of ourselves. That's funny. It's healthy. I miss Para Para. Oh, yeah. That was a good one, too. I think the Para Para was more of a good aerobic workout than just DDR is because you move in your arms with it. It's a lot more. Well, maybe that's what they hope to accomplish with this Wii thing. Well, at any rate, there's a little bit more to this that I think is cool is the Office of West Virginia Governor. Actually, it looks like there's an association with the Department of Education and a few other facilities, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield, are giving some financial support to eventually lead this into DDR games, training PE teachers, and promoting DDR clubs in West Virginia public schools. And Konami gets all the profits, but that's okay because it keeps new DDR games coming out at home, and as long as they stay innovative, hey, they're fine by me. I just laugh for all those people who say, oh, DDR won't work in America. I bet you feel so stupid now. Well, you know what? This news is so huge that they even covered it on the national news. Did you hear that? Really? Yes. I have a clip. Hold on. Researchers in West Virginia announced Friday the results of a study that suggests playing the video game Dance Dance Revolution improves the health of overweight kids, though not as much as its rival game, Hamburger on a String. Okay. Obviously, that was from Saturday Night Live. It's still kind of funny, nonetheless, to see a little DDR joke make its way into Weekend Update there. I like Hamburger on a String. And who doesn't love? I miss Kevin Nealon doing the Weekend Update. Yeah, but I love Amy Poehler. I love her. She's fine. Not as good as Tina Fey, but I love her. She was with Upright Citizens Brigade. But anyway. Hamburger on a String. Ha! I miss Chevy Chase, too. I know. So, you know, we all know that the PlayStation 3 resembles a George Foreman grill or a grill of some sort. Yeah. In fact, people have gone as far as making it into an actual grill. Well, now there's this one retailer in Akihabara that's selling some unofficial 6-axis soy sauce to go with the PlayStation 3 grill. That's kind of a joke. They've basically rebranded some of the Bulldog brand soy sauce and, yeah, it's actually quite funny. They feature it in the smaller 20GB size or the larger 60GB size. Is it $599 US dollars? Is it made from giant enemy crabs? No. All these jokes will never get old. It's actually, it's being sold at Sagatsu Isagi and it's being retailed for 3.99 yen marked down from 4.99 yen and 5.99 yen for the larger one. And it's kind of funny, though, because it has a picture of Ken Kataragi on the front there. Eating crabs? And it also has a picture of... The PlayStation 3 with the top lifted up with the grill on it. To be honest, I think that would be pretty cool if there was a grill on it because then you could eat and watch a Blu-ray movie at the same time. If anyone doesn't know, Akihabara is the technical district, I guess, where you can buy all of your techie goods and now barbecue sauce. I really want to buy barbecue sauce when I go buy a stereo. DJ Jenai says, 6-axis equals most innovative controller ever. PS3 is the best. Glad to know we have some Sony fans in chat because sometimes it feels like there are no Sony fans left in the world, so I'm glad to see somebody is still standing behind them. Anyhow, certainly these guys are fans of Sony. They just express their fanboyism in a different way because it's, let's see, who did this? On the first day that firmware 3.10 came out, it got cracked. That's kind of funny. This was cracked by team C plus D and basically what happened is that of course they released the new firmware just a few days ago and it got cracked right in the same day by this team who works hard to crack the games, I'm sorry, to crack the firmware so that you can still continue to play your old school Nintendo games on your PS3. And they've already come out with custom firmware for 3.1, so great, now you can actually install the custom firmware, play all your updated games, and still be able to play your wonderful NES ROMs. DJ Jenai says, continuous is Sony fanboyism, saying, come on, Sony does what Nintendon't, the Rob D counters with, everyone stands behind Sony, to laugh at them behind their back. Rama says, I'll wait for the PS3 to be redesigned in retail for $149, give it six more months. Ouch. All right, any more PlayStation stories? I suppose I have some information. Okay. Some. Well, there's a little game that spawned a very interesting little music video called Saints Row. It's been confirmed that it will be going on to PS3, it's saying that sometime this spring it will have PlayStation Network support, and so that means multiplayer online. There was a mention, however, if they're going to have any additional content. Speaking of Saints Row, and that game had some CD parts in it, well, if you happen to be in some of the CD parts of Japan, you too can play the PlayStation 3 in one of Japan's love hotels, and yes, that is one of those brothel hotels. Casa Di Du in Shibuya, Tokyo, they have, with, I guess, your stay at these love hotels, you can be able to play PlayStation 3 for free. So I guess that's great, but at the same time, you know, I would be thinking, if you're staying at a love hotel, wouldn't you be going there for sex and not to play the PlayStation 3? Or is Sony trying to tell me the PlayStation 3 is better than sex? Or is it one of those things where it's like, okay, I'm going here, and not only will I get a hot chick to sleep with me, or borderline hot chick to sleep with me, but she'll play games with me? Well, love hotels aren't really just that. They're also where people meet for rendezvous with their significant other. And then all she would have to do is bake me a pie, and it's like the full thing. I just wanted to get the death glare from Jamie. I thought that was interesting, though. I mean, I guess that's pretty cool, because after you've done it, then you can play video games. And it's just like you never left home. Going back to a previous story in chat, reading some comments here, Mike W. says, it was decrypted day one, talking about the firmware. Then it was cracked. Fault story, whatever. I don't care if OLR gets it wrong. Regardless, having the firmware get fucked with on day one, and having some form of security, to obsess with it, whether it be decryption or whatever it is, has got to say something. And it didn't take much longer after that, anyway. Ramas Bolden says, PlayStation 3 equals Sony's final console. The Rob D says, what would you listen to in a love hotel while playing video games? I want you to watch me play Madden Skip from Mad TV. I don't know if you've ever seen that, but it's kind of funny. Ravens Dolphin says, Loki is going there with Nelly to a love hotel. No, I wouldn't be going there. Why would I travel all the way to Japan to go to a love hotel? That's ridiculous. All right. Well, speaking of good lovin', there's this interesting thing here in Utah. They have that games as porn bill that keeps trying to pass over and over again. Well, unfortunately, the State House Committee of Utah voted to hold the legislation for the third time the other day, and the reason is freedom of speech. So of course, what they were trying to do is try to change it to say that Utah was going to be basically had to be sold as like pornography does. Let's see, Republican Kay McCliff had this to say, I am concerned when all the legal experts including our own Attorney General as well as the sponsor tell us that the bill is likely to fail in a constitutional challenge, one where we cannot control the amount we spend because we spend our side and then we are potentially obliged to spend the legal costs of the other side. Kay is trying to draft a substitute bill to replace the original. Leave it to a Republican. Well, you know, I don't want to turn this into a political war, but it's just general ignorance, I think, about the gaming community from everyone, and I think a lot of folks could stand to be educated no matter who you are or how you vote. I think a lot of- But mostly Republicans. I think a lot of people just don't get it. I'm just giving y'all a hard time. All right. Well, but there is- I have some- I do have some news about someone who has his head up his ass that makes me happy, speaking of, you know, Republicans. Sorry, I won't go off on Republicans anymore. There- Okay, sorry, there was some debate going on. Can we start over, please? Yes. Okay, thank you. Um, speaking of someone who has, uh, his head up his ass, um, he who shall not be named except right now, Jack Thompson, um, has been, um, called on yet another complaint with the Florida Bar. Um, it's- Oh my God. Anyway, there's a pending judicial review, um, for five counts of professional misconduct against, uh, dumbass. I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be, you know, impersonal, right, um, against, uh, he who shall not be named to be, um, actually he's supposed to be going to the, uh, State Supreme Court, uh, for, uh, action. That's pretty cool. But the, uh, quote on here, um, says, uh, in the suit, uh, he who shall not be named represented the families of two Fayette, Alabama police officers and a police dispatcher murdered by an 18-year-old grand theft auto player in 2003. At the time of his arrest for the killings, Devin Moore reportedly said, life is like a video game, you have to die sometime. More subsequently convicted of the murders now sits on Alabama's death row. He who shall not be named was not involved in the criminal case against Moore. Um, yeah, honestly, the other, the other, um, two complaints actually have to do with, um, the attacks he made, um, on shock radio in South Florida and, um, you know, I'm just so disgusted. Really, I, I hope that, I hope that he is disbarred. I hope this is the end of it. And we never- That would be awesome if we never had to report on him again. That would be the best thing ever. I'd hold a party. Uh, Rama and Shay, I think, I think we would- You know what? If this happens, we should throw a party. We absolutely should throw a party. We have a special party edition of Orange Lounge Radio, um, celebrating the vanquishment of he who shall not be named. We'll get guests and everything. I bet you anything, because, you know, gamer Andy was a big part of that flower and he doesn't live that far away. I bet you we could get him here to join our party. We'll get, we'll invite some, we'll get, we'll hold a big, massive frickin' party if this happens. We'll play World Combat Armageddon. Yes. Custom characters. We'll play nothing but video games where we put Jack Tonsom in them, Tonsom in them. What about the, uh, the Combine game? Sure, we'll play that too. Why not? We'll play that too. And, and, and, and, and- That'll piss him off. And our Music of Choice's Two Life crew and Ice-T. Bring it on! I love this idea! You know what? I think we should have this party anyway! No, but we're, okay, the party only happens if he gets disbarred. Okay? Is that, is that the criteria? If he gets disbarred- If he gets disbarred- In the state of Florida, OLR, he lost his licensed party. He who shall not be named is vanquished. However, if he is not disbarred, we send him a bag of poo in the mail. No, no, no. We're not children. Come on. Maybe we could call this bar is open party. Going to the chatroom, Rama says, isn't he who shall not be named Voldemort? So should we start- So do you, do you see the metaphor here? Should we start calling him Jack- Should that be his new nickname, Jack Voldemort? Jack Voldemort. I love that idea. He is just he who shall not be named. From here on out, we are calling him Jack Voldemort. I love that idea. And by the way, the reason why I brought up Two Life Crew and Ice-T is that he was also instrumental in the whole, you know, the cop killer scandal for Ice-T and for Two Life Crew's as nasty as they want to be. Wasn't that what it was called? And we'll also listen to Howard Stern because- Yes, we should copy it and send it to Howard Stern. Oh, I love this idea. Here's hoping. Would this all happen like next week if it happens? I missed the dates in there. I hope it happens. I don't think the dates were listed. Everything in the legal thing is a slow process. We'll see. I'll have to check my legal sites. All right. Anyway, any time, you know, it's become tradition on this program. Any time a story about Jack Voldemort comes up, you know what's going to happen next. That's right. It's our chance to rant about whatever we want. It's the FUs of the week. Get it out of your system, Darkstalker. I have two. The first one, FU to my uterus. Next one is an FU to Roseville, Mitsubishi, you bastards. Okay. This is what happens. My husband has a 2006 Lancer- Oh god, what Lancer does he have? A rally art, sorry. So it's like a model under the evolution. It's a nice, nice car. And he uses it to go to work, and he uses it, you know, sometimes for a couple of Bay Area trips. He doesn't drive it really crazily. I drive more violently than he does, and my car is still in good shape. Well, the transmission blew. And he had, you know, a car with only 15,000 miles on it, he's only had it for a year. There's no reason for a transmission to go out that quickly. So he took it to Roseville, Mitsubishi. And Bob Coffee, what I was saying is that it's the step under the Evo. Listen to what I said. Hi. And the FU to my uterus is for PMS. But anyway, back to the car. When he took it in, this was, the car first of all has the 10 year warranty on it, bumper to bumper warranty. So he took the car in, and they said, well, you know, we have to strip it down to look at the transmission, and if it's your fault, you pay $1100 to fix it. Well, first of all, if you don't drive your car like shit, then there's no reason for the transmission to go out. So he said, to hell with that, and said, you're not going to charge me for taking it apart, you're going to do the diagnostic on it. Like fine, then the warranty won't cover it. So he gets on the line with the, I guess the Mitsubishi corporate, they have a big stink over it. He said the customer service girl was friendly, but said that the caseworker was all like, hey look, we're going to have them break down the car for free, it's our dime, which they should have done in the first place, hi! And then they said if they determine the transmission thing is his fault, then they'll put it back together for free, and let him take it wherever he feels that he needs to to pay less for it. So, if I start talking about how much I love my new WRX STI, you'll find out what happened. We had some, I'm reading comments from chat, we had someone named the uterus join chat, that says don't let your uterus drive your car. And Rama says fucking cunt, and I'm going to say don't talk to Jamie like that, that's rude. Can I talk to, no, no, no. I know, he was saying someone else. Let's see, and then also, but Rama did say this, which I thought was really funny. He said, so if Jack equals Voldemort, that means that Jamie equals Hermione, Sky equals Harry, and Loki equals Ron. Dude, that means that I get Victor Crumb, and then the movie gets kind of hot. What do I get, Cho Chang? Hippity doo da, alright, anyway, was that it? Are you and your uterus done? Except she was really cool with this being, having that thick Scottish accent, I totally did it, it's perfect. Are you and your uterus finished? I wish that men had cramps. We do get cramps in a different story. I wish that men had hormone related cramps. I would love it. Maybe someday you can have balls. You'd all be big babies. And so I can kick you in them. Alright, uh, Loki, well I wish we could drive better, but we don't always get what we want, do we now? You know what? Fuck you. We did figure out why, we did figure out though why women drive bad, it's because estrogen causes you to have, you know, I don't know, some sort of balance problems, or like, you know, the world spins or something, I don't know, we're just going to use that as an excuse for now. I drive really well. There's going to be a fight in the parking lot after the show. I drive rough. What? I drive really well. You drive like a bat out of hell, I mean, you do get us from point A to point B the quickest way possible. I'll give you that. But, I don't cut people off, I don't talk on my phone while I drive, I'm like somebody in this room. You cast hexes on people when you drive. And they get out of my way. Loki, finish. Um, I don't even remember what my FU of the week was to, uh, so yeah, I'm just going to say bad to women drivers because there's been a lot of them, especially driving slow or that, you know, they can't seem to, you know, navigate that minivan, you know, it's like if you can't fucking drive a car, just stay at home. Just fuck everybody who drives a minivan that doesn't need one of those. And I swear to god I fucking hate people that drive, you know, SUVs, off-road vehicles, mind you, that have to go over the fucking speed bumps like it's, like their car's made of glass. It's a fucking off-road car, it should be able to handle this damn little speed bump. I know my car could go over that super fast. Why can't yours? Oh my god, I'm having to loop the music, we're going to six minutes here. Actually, I have one, I have one more thing. Oh goody. I have one more. Alright. FU to people who think that just because you're married you need to start breeding. Moooo. Moooo. First of all, children do not save a marriage. It makes it worse. Secondly, if you can't afford... This is episode part FU, because that's all this segment's going to be. Secondly, if you cannot afford the child, don't have one. Thirdly, if I say I don't want children, fucking respect what I have to say. Don't keep pushing it until I go puke in the bathroom at Cattleman's. Thank you. Can I do my FUs now? No. Do I get to do my FUs? Okay, fine. Alright. So my FU of the week also goes to Jamie's uterus, and then I would like to say an FU. Just kidding. Heart. I don't think she heard me. My uterus, my choice. I would also like to give an FU, and it's my choice to say FU. Just kidding. Heart. Love you. No, seriously though, I want to say FU to dentistry, because oh my god, my dental bills. And it's not like my teeth are that awful. I don't think I have, like I've not got some crazy thing going on, like a gap or anything. It's just like, oh my god, I have so much money, and I can't afford her dental stuff, so it sucks. And then I got like a temporary crown way in the back where you can't even see it, and it fell out two days after I got it. I mean, come on. I just feel like every time, I feel like going to the dentist is like going to used car salesmen sometimes. There's so much pressure. No wonder people are afraid of the dentist. I'm not afraid of the dentist. I just fall asleep. It's not just, it's not the drill work I'm afraid of. I'm afraid of the way they treat people. Anyway. You should go to my dentist. She's really cool. I don't think my insurance will let me. That's a whole other FU. FU to your testicles, by the way. Thank you. Oh, sure, sure, anytime. FU, Jamie. Thank god, this is radio. Your testicles sound like Grover. Well they're blue. Welcome to octaves of Jamie that you normally don't listen. I don't know if it's picking up because she doesn't have the mic near her, but she's going to listen about three octaves higher than we usually hear. On this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, giggling schoolgirls, near, far, near, far. Thank god this is radio. Speaking of near and far, one game that's near dear to my heart, Grand Theft Auto, is doing really well far away in Japan, where Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has taken number one in their sales charts. That is right. Beating out such DS titles as those brain training things. Fuck brain training. It's all about killing hookers. That's really what Japan needs, and god damn it, they just got their dose of killing hookers. So way to go Japan. You just need to get on the bandwagon now with Grand Theft Auto IV, then I could be killing more hookers from Japan. Kevin DDR says, what, GTA can't do well in Japan? It's doing well now. It's number one. But I mean, should that be such a big deal? I mean, it's number one here. Was it not allowed to do well in there? Usually US games don't do very well in Japan. So I would think, you know, that, you know. Rob says, sounds like the OLR crew just got ahold of the wacky weed. No, we don't. I don't know about the other two, but I don't really do that. Drinking's fine, but we're not drunk either tonight, and only when drinking responsibly. So. Rob. Winners don't use drugs. Remember the FBI warning. Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob. What? Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob. What? Never do that again. It was funny and you know it. Never do that. Speaking of blue things, Sonic the Hedgehog is, had a funny little misprint on Amazon and a little screen shot made its way to Kotaku this week and they labeled the story Sonic the Vacuum Cleaner because they put a little picture of Sonic the Hedgehog under Dirt Devil Upright Vacuum. Obviously this is some type of database mistake, but it makes people LOL nonetheless because it's kind of funny to see things wrong like that. Like remember when they were selling the Wii for like $1,119 or whatever was the release date? Somebody screwed up the database? Something similar happened here. Maybe they just found out that Sonic the Hedgehog sucked? Haha! I see what you did there because I hadn't heard that joke a million times already on Kotaku. Speaking of games that suck, Unexpected. This is like totally rad. The Burger King had, they reported higher than anticipated quarterly earnings because of the Xbox 360 promo games, at least that's what they figured. The games actually pulled sales up to $38 million in the US alone. And so, how can these games have gone double platinum? I guess with the fact that they were $4 a piece. Because there are 2 million achievement point whores in the world who just needed the extra 600 points that these games would give is actually what happened. I guess. They are also now $0.99 each. I heard about that, that's crazy. So if you haven't bought them yet. There are two that I still need, I only have Sneak King. Yeah, if you haven't bought it yet, might as well do it, because $0.99, that's not bad for a game. Even if it does suck. You can collect collector's things before too long. It will be as rare as Rondo of Blood, okay maybe not. But nowhere near as awesome. Let's hear what games are coming out very soon that could soon become collector's items. Do you have any exclusives for us this week, Loki, on release dates? No, because I took time off work and there wasn't really much to mention anyway. We mentioned everything probably last week and anything exclusive would have been at Konami's Gamer Day and all that fun stuff. What was I going to say though? But this week though, there's some good stuff coming out. If you are a fan of Winning Eleven, you'll be happy to know that that is finally making its way out now on PlayStation 2, on the 360, DS, and PSP. So that's pretty awesome. Also there's going to be, actually there's not a lot of PlayStation 2 games coming out this week, I know that for a fact. I do believe the Final Fantasy VI comes out on the Game Boy Advance this week, which is pretty awesome. So definitely check that out, because I know, what is it, Five did really well, everybody's picking up Five. There should be some more Wii's and DS Lite's coming to, I want to say to all the retailers this week as well, because I know they've been out of stock for a long time. They were actually sold out on Nintendo for the last two weeks. Other than that stuff, wow, it was just a whole lot of crap coming out this week. So I want to say that's probably what I'd really, oh, how could I forget this, Diddycom Racing DS, that's coming out. So if you know. I've been seeing commercials for that. If you want to get your fix on a Mario Kart type racing game, and this is kind of cool, they've got a create your own track mode, you basically draw a track with the stylus, so that's kind of neat, R. Tonleko on Playstation 2, another Atlus RPG, so definitely worth checking out. If you're into puzzle games, Capcom Puzzle World on the PSP, so that was pretty fun, because it has Puzzle Fighter on it. Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI on Playstation 2, if you're a fan of that. And then MVP07 NCAA Baseball if you're into college baseball on Playstation 2. I just want to say release date wise, because I don't know if you explicitly stated this on an earlier show, but we did confirm that DDR Universe is February 27th. So almost March, but not quite. And I'd also like to mention Lunar Nights on the DS is coming out this week. Oh, very cool. Good, that was a neat title, I might have to pick that up. Coming out in Japan, we like to cover Japanese release dates too, because sometimes it's kind of interesting to see what they get a lot later, and also what they get over there now we may be getting over here pretty soon, and I wonder if this might be one of them on the Xbox 360, they're getting a badly needed role playing game this week, because you know Xbox kind of gets a lot of slack for not having a lot of choice when it comes to role playing games. I mean sure you have Phantasy Star, which is kind of borderline, and then you have Enchanted Arms, but they're getting a new game this week from Type, or I'm sorry from Idea Factory, it's called Diario Rebirth Moon Legend, it's a new RPG coming out on the Xbox 360, coming out in Japan on the 8th. It's coming out in Japan this week on the 8th, Fusion Frenzy 2 on the Xbox 360, coming out on the Playstation 3, Virtua Fighter 5 makes it's way this week on February 8th, that should be pretty cool, it's also coming out with a little stick, a Virtua stick is coming out just for that game. Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, guess what Jamie, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai, that's the subtitle for Cooking Mama on the Wii, coming out this week by Taito over there in Japan, oh she's over here to correct me, my horrible pronunciations, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai, I'm getting better, Taikai, give me that, I'm getting better, you're getting better, alright and coming out on the Playstation 2, Outrun 2 is coming out, Stella Deuce, and one of my favorite title names for this week coming from Capcom, Full House Kiss 2 is coming out on the Playstation 2, and the cover for Full House Kiss 2, it's four guys all surrounding a chick holding a bouquet, so you know what that means, they're all going to go banger. Coming out on other systems, the Nintendo DS has Jet Impulse and Luminous Arc and Morita Shogi on the DS, all coming out this week, and lastly do we have anything on the PSP, we do, New Rainbow Island, Herdy Gurdy Daibuken is coming out this week, that should be tons of fun I'm sure, I know, but it's kind of like, Bubble Bobble in general, like I remember like the retro Bubble Bobble stuff used to be cool, but ever since that whole no boss on level 30 thing I just, Rainbow Island, I'm burned down on that shit, Rondo of Blood, alright anyway. Okay, well, for our friends in the UK, there are some games coming out, which is a good thing because games coming out, you know, is fun, we have coming out February 6th, War Rock on PC, on the 8th, Sam & Max Episode 3, the Mole, the Mob, and the Meatball on PC, on the 9th though, just a crap ton of games, Avatar the Last Airbender on damn near everything, Battle Stations Midway, Battle Zone, Blade Dancer, Lineage of Light, Bomberman, Charlotte's Web on a few things, Deep Labyrinth, Maelstrom, Magical Starsign, Metal Slug Anthology, Naruto, Ultimate Ninja, Okami, scrolling down because I'm running out of room, Saint Seiya the Hades, Space Empires V, The Professor's Brain Trainer, Logic, and Memory, The Sims Life Stories, Thrillville, Totally Spies 2, Undercover, and that's it so far. Did you say they're getting Okami this week? Yeah, PlayStation 2. Now since way too many people overlooked that game over here, I'm leaving it up to you folks over in the UK to show Okami a little love so we make sure we get a sequel out of that game. Sound fair? I didn't know there was a Saint Seiya game. I don't think you're going to get a sequel since Clover Studios is gone. Oh fuck, that's right, huh? Lots of Metal Slug, everybody. Lots of Metal Slug. Okami's sequel is now sitting with my Guardian Legends sequel somewhere. Cry. Sob. Leap. QQ. Anyways, one movie that doesn't really need to be made is definitely going to be spawned from a game with lots of sequels, DOA the movie. Apparently it was going to be a theatrical movie but then apparently they realized, hey, you know what? The movie really sucks. So let's just release it straight to DVD, which means that someone dumped it to the internet. Doesn't the movie have Ally Larter in it? Who is... Devin Alki in it. Yeah. Ally Larter is the one chick on Heroes that nobody likes her storyline and everybody who TiVo's it fast-forward her scenes. Is she the one who plays the split personality? Yes. I haven't even watched any and I know who that is. I think she's in the movie, right? The only thing I saw was a scene of her in that place. I, you know, I... Spoilers! I told Rob. I know. It is available on Google Video and to be honest, if you really want to watch the whole thing I guess it's better than spending the money to rent it or buy it. But really, I just hear it's just yet another really bad movie. It won't play. Well, I think they had originally it linked on. Don't they keep taking it down and stuff? It keeps getting taken down, but it is. It does come back up and if you read the Kotaku story which links to the structural story. It's like that Natalie Portman video when she rapped on SNL. They just kept taking it off of YouTube and it kept coming right back. But here's what you can do if you really want to, you know, watch it and keep it or whatever. You can always download the PSP or iPod versions and you can download those straight to your PC. If you don't want to stream it later on. Brad from Pod Culture which is another indie podcast is in our chat room right now and says, LOL we just reviewed that on our latest episode. So if you want to hear Brad's review of Dead or Alive the movie, check out podculture.blogspot.com. This whole movie could have been made a lot better and worth watching if it were rated NC-17 and there was more nudity. Because right now as it stands there is no nudity in it so that is the main problem to why this, because it doesn't matter if the movie sucked, as long as it had nudity it would have been great. Whoever is playing this rondo of blood is really bad. I mean how about the, you know, how about the... You know one of those sites taped me playing one of the game. I don't know who did it, but you know how like they do the... Did you keep getting picked up by the dragon? No. Then this isn't you. Oh good. Because you know like sometimes they hook up their equipment like as you're playing it and they're taken. Like that happened... I know some of the Rumble Roses XX clips out there were mean because like I was sucked so bad I was getting owned and like so there's some Rumble Roses XX clip out there and I'm playing the chick who's getting killed really bad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I keep going back to... I know, total tangent stuff. Anyway. We will beat the Dracula out of her during the break folks, so don't worry. Oh, oh, oh. There is a new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan this spring. Sega and Toei Studios are teaming up for a feature-length adaptation. It's Ryugo Goto-ku is the Yakuza name, part two is coming out. It's coming out from Miike and he had practiced before making cinematic versions of the game, so should be interesting. He's also made Audition, Chakushin Ari, and one of Loki's favorites, Ichi the Killer. Ichi the Killer is awesome. He should be very excited about this new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan because if they tear some guy's face off and throw it against a wall, I mean, I don't see how that could be bad like in Ichi the Killer. That was gross. I still will not watch that. You don't think they have a special edition of that out now, I think? It's pretty violent. If they have a super violent version of the movie, I would totally watch that. I remember seeing it somewhere. Well, at any rate, you know, there's I'm sure people who are going to be a little violent over this bit of information. A major UK retailer, HMV, their online store, is taking pre-orders for PlayStation 3s, but you have to also purchase a 4GB PSP pack, so you'll be paying a total of \u00a3675. They're sending an email out that will say you become one of the lucky few who can pick up the PlayStation 3 at launch. The quote says, at HMV.co.uk, we've been working with Sony to offer up to 5,000 customers an incredible deal when you buy the new Sony 4GB PSP. Sony takes advantage of this offer, will get priority over other HMV.co.uk customers for the PlayStation 3. The deal also includes two PSP games, Kills and Liberation and Gangs of London, for the price of \u00a3674.99. Are they expecting the same mass hysteria over there in the UK that they had over here at first, which, you know, then after Christmas just kind of dropped off like a rock? I mean, is that, because that's the kind of shit we saw them doing over here when it came out. It's crazy, and then realize the Wii was better. Well, again, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, and, you know. So the Wii is better. Well, yeah, and the Wii had Zelda and all that. There's one good PlayStation 3 game out right now. One. I really hope more comes out. I mean, I, it's not that I want to see Sony fail, and it's not that I want to make fun of Sony, and I love my PlayStation 2, but, God damn, Sony. They're making it easy for us. I know, it's like, God, argh! We actually have not touched our PS3 in, I want to say, about two weeks now. And the only reason we actually put anything in it was to watch Talladega Nights, and that was Dan, and I left the room. I'm sorry I grew up in Alabama. Alpha Canagram says, I hadn't played Zelda in two to three weeks due to Virtual Console. You know, I forgot to say at the top of the show I've been playing Virtual Console, that's the other stuff I've been playing this week. Mario Kart 64, awesome. Still stuck on R-Type. I've been playing Zelda, Link to the Past, as well. R-Type. Zelda, Link to the Past, Super Contra 3. I can play that on my Nintendo. R-Type. My name's Jamie, and I have 50,000 consoles in my house. They're all collecting dust, too. We actually might sell some. Really? Yeah. I'll have to find money. I want a Virtual Boy, for no good reason. Do you have a Virtual Boy? You want to buy mine? Five dollars. Seriously? Five dollars right now. I don't know. I'm going to get five dollars right fucking now. I might have some change in my room. Alright, anyhow. I'll take it for six. Ten? Do I hear ten? Fuck you, bitch. I'll buy ten. I put down ten. Fifteen. Do we hear fifteen? Fuck that. It's not worth fifteen dollars. Yay! Ten dollars! Guess what? I lied. You're a bitch. Alright, anyway. You still love me. Maybe. While we all fight out how we're going to buy the console behind the scenes and play OLR Bay, while we do that, we're going to take a quick break. For those of you guys listening to us on the Audio Archive, aka Podcast, we'll be back in a couple days.
