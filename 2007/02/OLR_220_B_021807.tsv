0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	25000	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for part B of our podcast.
25000	31000	This is the first time you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Remember that we do broadcast in two parts because we tape live on Sunday nights
31000	35000	for about three hours or as tonight's going maybe about four hours.
35000	41000	There's some bonus stuff that you can only hear when you listen to us live or when you listen to us on our rebroadcast over at www.allgames.com
41000	47000	which is Mondays at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time and Tuesdays at 9 a.m.
47000	53000	We like all games because it's this big melting pot of independent podcasts on the internet so it's cool.
53000	58000	We're happy to be a part of it and we're also happy to bring you some more gaming news so let's get back into it.
58000	66000	Yeah and I don't see this happening anytime soon. I see In The Groove being made by Konami before this ever happens.
66000	74000	But apparently Microsoft's Rare, people are thinking just because Diddy Kong Racing came out and that was made by Rare
74000	79000	that more Rare games are going to make their way I guess to the DS.
79000	87000	Well probably not the case but according to Microsoft's VP Shane Kim, he spoke to one up and basically told them
87000	93000	a cameo or Viva Pinata on DS makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways from a franchise perspective.
93000	100000	I think it's fair to say we're going to continue to invest in Viva Pinata but you probably won't see it on the PSP.
100000	107000	I would say you probably won't see it on the DS either because that's still a competing system with them I mean.
107000	112000	That seems so weird to me. So you're basically saying people are assuming because of the fact he said that.
112000	121000	And this just further lends that thing that Microsoft is secretly in bed with Nintendo but they are so the bottom
121000	127000	because Reggie just keeps regulating on Microsoft that no we don't want to form a partnership with Microsoft
127000	130000	we'd rather you buy more of our games and more of our components.
130000	135000	So Microsoft is totally being a submissive bottom in this relationship because now they're talking about
135000	140000	oh but Nintendo I'll totally put Viva Pinata inside you.
140000	147000	I don't know is it just me?
147000	155000	It would work but first off Viva Pinata the graphics wouldn't look right.
155000	161000	I mean it's just another kind of not really a Pokemon type of game but it's you know your breeding stuff.
161000	163000	I don't know.
163000	169000	SSJ100Matt says maybe Microsoft should give Nintendo advice on internet play. You win.
169000	173000	Yeah. Seriously.
173000	180000	Bandit says hey Rare and yes I'm talking with my mouth full I can do that it's partly my show too.
180000	184000	Bandit says hey Rare give me Killer Instinct already.
184000	186000	I say that with a mouth full of donut.
186000	188000	Fuck that you get Banjo-Kazooie.
188000	191000	Ewww.
191000	193000	Kazooie wasn't that bad.
193000	194000	Yes it was.
194000	199000	Mike W says Major Nelson hearts Nintendo.
199000	201000	So does Trixie.
201000	203000	I remember reading on one of Trixie's blogs in the expo.
203000	205000	I have no idea why I was reading Trixie's blog.
205000	207000	I was bored on the internet and that's where I found myself.
207000	212000	Whenever I hear Trixie I think of the stripper in the Rocky Horror Picture Show but never mind.
212000	215000	So I'm like do you perform with the cast?
215000	220000	Anyway Trixie she wrote like her Christmas list and one of the things on the Christmas list was a Wii.
220000	223000	Then I was like aren't you guys supposed to be competitors?
223000	228000	So Microsoft again being the submissive big old bottom.
228000	231000	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
231000	233000	That's your thing.
233000	238000	Can I say personally though that I'm actually really impressed at how the Xbox 360 just took off.
238000	241000	I mean again I'm more of a spectator because of little money.
241000	249000	But I mean at the very beginning having an Xbox was just no you know you have a console that freezes.
249000	255000	And everybody's giving crap to all my friends who you know initially went out and bought an Xbox.
255000	258000	And the 360 seems to be kicking some serious ass.
258000	263000	So I mean that seems to be exciting and it's actually something that I enjoyed as well when I started to play it.
263000	272000	I think the problem with the classic Xbox can be personified with a comic strip I used to read that hasn't really been updated in a long time.
272000	283000	But if you ever read Spamusement I think the problem with the Xbox was brilliantly summed up in a Spamusement cartoon where it said the subject line.
283000	289000	For those who don't know Spamusement takes spam email subject lines and make cartoons out of them.
289000	293000	So the spam email subject line was are you man enough for this?
293000	299000	And what it was is it was an Xbox with a deep fryer attachment.
299000	303000	And that was the problem with the original Xbox is it was too butch.
303000	305000	But the Xbox 360.
305000	307000	And the controller was just too fucking big.
307000	316000	The Xbox 360 you know it's still butch you know it's not gay but it's a little fruity and that's okay.
316000	320000	It's got like Viva Pinata.
320000	324000	I was this close actually to getting my boyfriend the Xbox 360.
324000	326000	I'm too good I got my ex a PSP for Christmas.
326000	332000	I was this close to actually getting my boyfriend the 360 because that's what he loves because he loves the Xbox for Christmas.
332000	339000	But well I figured that the Xbox was 300 something odd dollars worth of depreciation.
339000	341000	Whereas the guitar gets worth more.
341000	346000	And also the Xbox 360 is worth a lot of ignoring girlfriend time.
346000	351000	So but you know when the price drops up I'll probably invest in it because people are very happy with them.
351000	355000	Oh JV Mon sums it up perfectly the 360 is metrosexual.
355000	362000	Not to I hate going back to the well no I don't but not to go too much back to the gay issue.
362000	368000	But I get a magazine called The Advocate which is basically a gay and lesbian magazine specifically.
368000	370000	Is that Glad's agenda?
370000	373000	Because you know I am a gay gamer I'm not the biggest fan of Glad.
373000	375000	Because they have to get their panties ruffled too easy.
375000	381000	I don't know who it was but they were talking about how video games are starting to bring more of that in.
381000	386000	And they were talking like Bully was one of them Sims 2 but they talked about Gears of War.
386000	392000	Like the two main characters like no one can convince me that those two characters are not boning each other.
392000	398000	Well look you know one of the achievements is called I wish I knew how to quit you or like Dom curious.
398000	402000	I don't remember what it was called something like oh no that was like I can't quit you Dom or something like that.
402000	404000	It's one of the achievements in Gears of War.
404000	405000	Oh my god.
405000	407000	There's subtleties there.
407000	410000	Meg's giving me huge shit about it like they are not.
410000	413000	It's nothing major it's just an LOL moment.
413000	420000	It's not trying to make a statement or anything like oh Cliffy B is like secretly a gay supporter.
420000	424000	Maybe he is I don't who cares it's a video game who cares.
424000	429000	I can't tear away my boyfriend from Gears of War at Best Buy does that make him kind of gay?
429000	430000	You can tear away your microphone with gay.
430000	434000	Because I'll totally go for the guy that said he'd marry me for like an adventure game.
434000	437000	I got gay from Rob a long time ago with the Pepsi bong.
437000	438000	Alright anyhow.
438000	441000	Golf Land.
441000	446000	I'm being asked by several people please tell me you aren't a crab person.
446000	449000	No well both of us because we are both gay.
449000	452000	Did you ever see an episode of South Park with the crab people?
452000	453000	Queer Eye?
453000	455000	Never mind.
455000	457000	Do we ever talk video games on the show?
457000	463000	Yes we do once in a while and this is a very interesting sort of game that's coming to the DS.
463000	468000	There's a new brand of toys in Japan called Treasure Gaust and it's going to be coming to the DS.
468000	469000	Well get this.
469000	475000	You remember how like Boktai used Sunlight and there was another game in Japan that used bar codes?
475000	483000	This game uses natural magnetic fields to build your Pokemon-ish type creatures.
483000	489000	So the game is encouraging you to find the Earth's natural magnetic fields to build your monster.
489000	493000	Dude that's interesting but I did not like Boktai.
493000	498000	Lunar Nights looks kind of cool or actually I played Lunar Nights it was kind of fun but Boktai was not fun for me.
498000	501000	Take your DS to a power plant.
501000	505000	Or get a blacklight in your house because that thing will send that thing off the rockets.
505000	509000	I wonder if a fridge magnet will fuck with this game.
509000	511000	Do they have those stones that make noise?
511000	514000	So there you go Treasure Gaust coming to the DS.
514000	517000	Boy the DS now really does everything.
517000	521000	Well that's kind of cool though because it's like degausting your monitor by now.
521000	522000	It's certainly something new.
522000	525000	Well here is something new but not really.
525000	527000	We get more Harvest Moon.
527000	530000	Da award of the week.
530000	535000	Harvest Moon DS will be out on the 13th of April.
535000	544000	I know at least in the UK I'm not sure if that's also playing to the US because I got my information off of UK stuff.
544000	557000	However it's more cows and more sheep and you get tutorials on how to raise your animals and plant seeds and crops and make money on your farm.
557000	560000	Fall asleep while playing a video game.
560000	563000	And have sex with Harvest Sprites and the Witch Princess.
563000	565000	I'm awake.
565000	566000	No really.
566000	568000	And then you can actually get married in the game.
568000	572000	You have 25 villagers and you can go fishing.
572000	578000	And all they do is just nag you the fucking tend to the animals.
578000	582000	You can probably you know hump the sheep or something.
582000	585000	All they do is stay at home and watch Oprah while you're out milking the cow.
585000	587000	I have a Harvest Moon sheep.
587000	589000	I do.
589000	592000	He sleeps by my bed with Stitch.
592000	596000	Gaming Nerd says I'm buying this game.
596000	597000	There you go.
597000	602000	John Dorian says I think Harvest Moon for the DS already came out.
602000	604000	I don't know if this is a new one.
604000	606000	I think this is a new one.
606000	611000	There's a new Harvest Moon game every year on every platform so you know it's the same fucking thing every time.
611000	614000	I'm sorry I'm not a big Harvest Moon fan if you can't already tell.
614000	618000	I find the game to be incredibly boring yet I love Animal Crossing.
618000	622000	So obviously my taste in games is fucked I admit it.
622000	624000	Evangelicals love Animal Crossing.
624000	626000	Evangelicals love Animal Crossing?
626000	627000	Why would Evangelicals?
627000	630000	You should have seen the shit we were doing in Animal Crossing.
630000	635000	I got one of my animals to always say you cunt after everything they said.
635000	637000	Can I have a fish you cunt?
637000	641000	And then like we painted gay pride symbols and put them all over town.
641000	644000	Remember the girls in my village who was their village lesbian?
644000	648000	My Animal Crossing village was an evangelical nightmare.
648000	651000	On my DS one though we had our village lesbian and when she moved out we cried.
651000	653000	No I remember that.
653000	656000	It's because I hit her with a bug net so much.
656000	659000	She went to Julie's village and she was a PE teacher.
659000	660000	She had gym equipment.
660000	661000	That's right she had gym equipment in her house.
661000	663000	She was such a lesbian.
663000	666000	And so we made a little rainbow sign to be outside of her house.
666000	667000	Do you know why Animal Crossing is sick?
667000	670000	Because we're talking about these people like they're real.
670000	674000	You know you liked Olivia.
674000	678000	That's the one I think I got to say you cunt after everything.
678000	679000	Yes.
679000	684000	There's nothing funnier than getting video game characters to say shit and poop.
684000	685000	Yay!
685000	687000	How about peepee caca?
687000	688000	Anyway.
688000	690000	I had one that said that.
690000	691000	So, Capcom.
691000	692000	Yeah, they're awesome.
692000	699000	They used to have a studio called Clover which put out such games like Okami, Viewtiful Joe,
699000	701000	fun stuff like that.
701000	705000	Well of course you remember Clover went bye bye.
705000	711880	But now the four members of Clover have formed a brand new studio called Seeds and no projects
711880	718140	have been announced from them yet but of course you know features such a wonderful talent
718140	730480	as Sushi Nabi or Naba which he worked on Viewtiful Joe, Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami and Devil
730480	738800	McRise, Hideki Kamiya and I probably butchered those names but should be interesting.
738800	744640	Hopefully we get some more original games kind of like actually they worked on what
744640	745640	was it?
745640	746640	Gun Hand was?
746640	747960	I think that was the name of that.
747960	748960	God Hand.
748960	749960	That's what it was.
749960	751360	That was okay.
751360	754440	But yeah, awesome.
754440	757480	More studios making more games.
757480	764720	I have on another completely different tangent, I have the news that might save PlayStation
764720	767120	3 and here it is.
767120	772800	There's a rumor going around that there are because based off reports from Japan that
772800	778020	the head of the Sony financial division is suggesting that a PlayStation 3 price cut
778020	781020	in 2007 may be on the way.
781020	784500	Now it seems like there's a story about this like every other week but this one's really
784500	787880	been circulating around the different blogs so we hope there's a little bit of truth to
787880	791480	it but the honest end of it is if there is a price cut coming it's probably not till
791480	795880	Christmas because they'll try to lie to fire under PS3 sales.
795880	800400	They're going to have to because Halo 3 is going to be a big problem.
800400	806180	I would say if they want to be smart they'll cut it the same day or I mean they'll cut
806180	812480	the price of the PlayStation 3 the same day as the Halo 3 comes out.
812480	815040	That would be the best thing ever.
815040	817480	We'll see what happens.
817480	820960	Well as for other things that we're seeing happening and I really wish we weren't seeing
820960	827840	this happen there's an Aqua Teen Hunger Force game on the PS2 and this is what you get for
827840	830960	drinking beer milkshakes.
830960	839600	Yeah it's a golfing game I know it's just extreme combat golf they call it.
839600	843440	Who's story is this?
843440	847280	Okay till it's warm at the game Jamie go right ahead.
847280	849080	Can I say something completely random first?
849080	851120	Jamie likes to do that to my stories.
851120	855520	This has nothing to do with gaming at all but you know how in Rocky Horror Picture Show
855520	859240	at the end you always have like if you ever go see it live in the theater when Riff Raff
859240	864460	and Magenta come back into the they're sometimes dressed up as famous couples or some type
864460	868120	of coupling like you know maybe they'll come like well I remember one time when I actually
868120	871240	performed as Riff Raff we came out as the characters from Brokeback Mountain and you
871240	876440	know just like couples like that well last night they came out in these giant cardboard
876440	881440	cutouts of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and it was the best gold scene I'd ever seen in my life.
881440	883560	Jenna is papayas!
883560	885880	Something like that.
885880	887680	Sorry that was that random moment was brought to you.
887680	891760	I was just sort of in shock because I'm like it's bad enough that it's Aqua Teen Hunger
891760	897880	Force but they have to just completely turn the state in my heart and making it combat
897880	901520	golf with sawed-off shotguns.
901520	906520	Um Midway stop taking the LSD please.
906520	908800	You are not a hero.
908800	911800	You cannot tell the future through Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
911800	913900	Lay off the drugs.
913900	915560	Next please.
915560	921320	I want to read some comments from chat real quick going to let's see back to the PlayStation
921320	922320	3 story.
922320	924280	Let's have T says PlayStation 3 needs a price cut.
924280	927320	That's the only way that it might become a real threat to Microsoft.
927320	933640	SSJ 100 Matt says Aqua Teen Hunger Force game the only game that won't be in Boston.
933640	938680	To which WB Bulldogs tags along to that the Boston scare was a bunch of bullshit.
938680	940760	Media blowing things out of proportion.
940760	944040	Got the show a lot of visibility although I hear it didn't help in the ratings that's
944040	945040	too bad.
945040	947240	Well the ratings are doing pretty good as it is.
947240	950040	I mean yeah the show is doing fine as it is so what can you do?
950040	951040	Anyways.
951040	952040	Cool!
952040	953040	Megatox is going to let me borrow a hotel desk.
953040	954040	I don't want to play this.
954040	955600	Oh I want a game!
955600	956600	You mean book.
956600	957600	I can't have the game.
957600	958600	He's loaning it to me.
958600	959600	I'm taking it back and burning it.
959600	960600	Oh game lust!
960600	965720	Neek Latov says I'm not allowed to rub the game against my chest.
965720	969600	Do you want to say anything real quick because you haven't been on the show really?
969600	972400	We had everybody like Grand Central Station through here in part A.
972400	975280	Are we still talking about video games?
975280	976480	Once in a while.
976480	981360	We just talked about the Aqua Teen Hunger Force game and well Loki's going to be getting
981360	982360	in the next story.
982360	983840	You want to say anything?
983840	988400	First I'm super excited for Silent Hill the shooty game because it's got Pyramid Head
988400	992220	and secondly I'm super excited because I got hit on tonight that was fun.
992220	993800	The end.
993800	994880	Maybe some chatters will hit on you.
994880	995880	You should send your pic.
995880	998120	Oh no you're in our top on Myspace.
998120	999440	Here you go.
999440	1001440	Alright anyway sorry.
1001440	1003440	Well fuck you.
1003440	1005320	Alright sorry.
1005320	1008660	So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio please don't let this
1008660	1012520	be representative of every show.
1012520	1016360	Every time I'm on this frickin' show you say that Rob.
1016360	1018480	Every single time.
1018480	1020360	It doesn't mean anything I swear.
1020360	1021360	Heart.
1021360	1022360	Broken.
1022360	1028800	Oh okay I get to read a story now.
1028800	1029800	That's great.
1029800	1035560	Anyways apparently the team behind Ico is working on a brand new title for the PS3.
1035560	1041220	People are hoping that it's a brand new version of Shadow Colossus or even Ico.
1041220	1045500	Although it's probably going to be something original that looks yet very similar to both
1045500	1048760	those two games.
1048760	1053880	No word on what it is but we know that they're working on something.
1053880	1056960	There's something coming soon.
1056960	1063240	You gotta love gaming news like that.
1063240	1065000	Something is coming.
1065000	1069080	Something is coming to the PlayStation 3 and it's got a big schnauzer.
1069080	1070080	It's Qbert.
1070080	1071080	Perverts.
1071080	1077680	Qbert's coming to the PlayStation 3 on February 22nd, hey that's this week, $4.99 undercutting
1077680	1081800	the cost of the average Microsoft game by one cent.
1081800	1083640	Good job Sony.
1083640	1087000	And of course Qbert will have the online leaderboards.
1087000	1094120	It's going to be in 720p and apparently players will be fighting against each other to see
1094120	1098840	who can be the supreme noser because that's the number one personal leaderboard is the
1098840	1100960	supreme noser.
1100960	1107040	I'm sorry, Qbert jumped the shark when they had the Qbert cartoon although that was kind
1107040	1108040	of cool.
1108040	1109040	But I do love the Qbert game.
1109040	1114080	I do love the fact that Sony can't really say anything about their PlayStation network
1114080	1116400	right now because there's nothing on it.
1116400	1117400	Nothing.
1117400	1118520	There's nothing on there.
1118520	1121760	There's like six games and a few demos and that's it.
1121760	1127320	To be honest, the fucking Nintendo network has more stuff on it than the Sony network.
1127320	1129800	I mean, come on, put out some more shit.
1129800	1134160	I don't care if this is stuff that's already been on like the 360 or whatever.
1134160	1135160	More games.
1135160	1136160	Seriously.
1136160	1137160	More demos.
1137160	1139760	I mean, full auto 2 demo.
1139760	1144540	Only months after the game came out, hooray, and you know what, the game still sucks.
1144540	1148320	And I don't know, they just need more shit.
1148320	1152120	Qbert is not filling the void that they need.
1152120	1153120	More original stuff.
1153120	1154760	And no PSP ports.
1154760	1158040	Top it with the goddamn PSP ports.
1158040	1164120	Well why don't we move away from Sony's stinky poop pile of a camp and go to the Nintendo
1164120	1165200	world.
1165200	1169520	Although this is actually pretty poopy too.
1169520	1179520	Cooking Mama Cook Off has actually been pushed back, sorry, in Europe.
1179520	1180520	Sorry Europe.
1180520	1184280	The original release date was March 29th, now it's pushed back to May 10th.
1184280	1187840	They are not listing a reason.
1187840	1189200	That's really crappy, isn't it?
1189200	1190200	Don't worry Europe.
1190200	1192200	Mama will fix it.
1192200	1196040	I had to, sorry.
1196040	1197920	We love you Europe.
1197920	1202720	Even though we don't like the band.
1202720	1207360	Okay, well, you know, news of Cooking Mama getting delayed, even if it doesn't directly
1207360	1212240	affect us here in the US, we feel you're angst, our listeners overseas.
1212240	1218360	We feel you're angst, and therefore we dedicate this FUs of the Week segment to our overseas
1218360	1228560	listeners.
1228560	1230760	Dark Sakura, start us off with the angst.
1230760	1236800	Fuck you to accidents, because I banged my wrist into a big metal pole today and I had
1236800	1243960	a big bruise, and now I have a big soul and scald on my hand from your freaking tea, Rob.
1243960	1249920	You didn't have to, but it was yummy, thank you.
1249920	1251920	I didn't buy it.
1251920	1253920	Oh, thank you.
1253920	1259400	And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, um, FU to having to pay $800 to buy on the talk
1259400	1260400	table.
1260400	1261400	Loki!
1261400	1271240	Um, I don't really have anything, other than, I guess, um, FU people that can't, you know,
1271240	1277720	abide by street dates, you know, I know that's a bit, you know, hypocritical, but yeah, anyway,
1277720	1278720	it's an exception.
1278720	1284920	Because you see, the rules state that you cannot sell it, rent it, or, um, make it available
1284920	1288240	to the public, you know, in that form.
1288240	1290000	Playing it is not on there.
1290000	1293160	Playing it is okey-dokey, so that's all I did was play it.
1293160	1297040	I didn't sell it or rent it, so I'm off scuffery.
1297040	1300880	But anyways, um, other people though, even people that should know better, like some
1300880	1305480	of the CompUSA's and EB games out there, it's, there's a big fucking sticker on it that says
1305480	1310640	do not sell before 2.20, don't be a dumb fuck, I mean, you're not getting paid that much
1310640	1314960	money to do your job, and I mean, and honestly, no one gives a shit if you have the game,
1314960	1317360	you know, days before everybody else.
1317360	1322600	No one's gonna forget it, you know, down the line anyways, so, who gives a crap?
1322600	1326640	But I need more people to buy this game, so I can play with them on time, so it's gonna
1326640	1327640	be fun.
1327640	1331200	I'm thinking about it, but 60 bucks is a lot to spend, I mean, look how much I play
1331200	1332200	Gears of War.
1332200	1334240	It, it, it's fun, it really is fun.
1334240	1335240	I'll think about it.
1335240	1337720	You gotta bring your copy over so I can play.
1337720	1338720	Alright.
1338720	1342800	Um, my view of the week goes to my voice, because I'm losing it again, and that sucks,
1342800	1346440	because, um, you know, for those that say I talk too much on this show, do realize I'm
1346440	1350760	used to talking all day and getting paid for it for a living, uh, in the teaching world,
1350760	1355720	so, uh, yeah, I'm losing my voice and having to go to my day job tomorrow, it's gonna kinda
1355720	1356720	suck.
1356720	1358720	Luckily I can just give my class a test.
1358720	1359720	I'm off, Rob.
1359720	1360720	Well, you suck.
1360720	1364480	I'll be, I'll be at, at home enjoying my day off for you.
1364480	1365480	Good.
1365480	1366800	You have fun with that, bitch.
1366800	1367800	Alright.
1367800	1369800	I mean, I love you, Rissa!
1369800	1370800	Hi!
1370800	1371800	Yay!
1371800	1373640	You're, you're inaugural FUs of the week, what do you wanna angst on?
1373640	1376400	Ooh, yeah, I get to break my FU of the week, sorry.
1376400	1381000	It's funny, because, um, as my friends like to say, um, after work, I love to get my hate
1381000	1387440	on, but I'm having such a good time being up here up north, of NorCal rules, and SoCal's
1387440	1391800	rules, for the moment, I'm an LA native, um, but my FU of the week is so funny, because
1391800	1396280	I hate, I hate that I love to get my hate on, as my, yeah.
1396280	1397280	Let it all out, baby, let it all out.
1397280	1398280	Let it all out!
1398280	1399280	I'm, like, in a slayer, what can I say?
1399280	1403360	Uh, I guess my FU of the week can go to my ex-boyfriend, not because I'm bitter, okay,
1403360	1410000	I am a little bit, but, uh, cuz he has every reason, which one, huh, oh, not him, oh, cuz
1410000	1412120	I was gonna say that one, you have every reason.
1412120	1415960	Oh, FU of the week to him too, but, uh, David, AKA S.S.
1415960	1421640	Caley and big, uh, gamer, g-gamer nerd, and he likes to make anime and music videos, and
1421640	1429000	instead of, and he probably does, that's why I'm doing it, and instead of going out, which
1429000	1432120	is okay, because I would pay for everything anyway, and I got on the PSP, because you
1432120	1437440	know why, because I am the best ex-boyfriend ever, but, uh, we used to play the green cast
1437440	1440920	on the lawn instead of going anywhere, and, well, cuz I wasn't allowed to go in the house
1440920	1443040	and put the green cast on the lawn.
1443040	1447200	Oh, and, um, and FU of the week to people, um, with Honda's, because I love my Honda,
1447200	1452360	but putting a fart can on your Honda, okay, Honda's are great, Honda's are fantastic,
1452360	1456960	I love it, but they're economical, and, and, and good on gas, but they're not FU-ing racing
1456960	1461840	shoes, so, yeah.
1461840	1466040	And last but not least, some, uh, lesbian FUs from Chris.
1466040	1474000	Uh, I have, I have, uh, two quick ones, I won't be too long, uh, one, FU to, uh, the
1474000	1479960	Scientology Center for fucking roping my father into it, leave my father alone, he's old,
1479960	1485360	he's bitter, and he has money, knock the fuck off, I'm so sick of those people, and, uh,
1485360	1487960	FU of the week to me, because...
1487960	1490960	You sure are awesome.
1490960	1498760	Yeah, but, I don't, I wish I could do more for Meg D. I know I've rinsed out stuff, like,
1498760	1503360	every week that I'm on here with Meg D, but she lives in Wisconsin, she goes to school
1503360	1508480	full-time, she's at work part-time, and she's got ASUN coming up where she's being in costume
1508480	1513880	and stuff like that, and she's just so stressed out, and I FU to me for not being able to
1513880	1515840	do something to help her more.
1515840	1521120	You know what, she's got, she's obviously got a gal who loves her very much, and, you
1521120	1525080	know, a lot of people in this world are not that lucky, so, you know, that's what she
1525080	1526080	can do.
1526080	1528640	I just wish I could do more for her.
1528640	1532960	I hate not being there when she's sitting there, you know, just stressed out, it's so
1532960	1533960	infuriating.
1533960	1536640	Oh, she's gonna come out here, and then you guys are gonna get married and have 10,000
1536640	1538120	babies, so, you know.
1538120	1539120	Fuck yeah.
1539120	1540120	And they're all mine!
1540120	1541120	They're all gonna be named Mr. Sinister.
1541120	1545720	No, no, she wants a child and name it Mr. Sinister to guarantee she never has children,
1545720	1548440	I will be popping them out the fucking next day.
1548440	1549440	Wow.
1549440	1550440	She'll enjoy that.
1550440	1555840	Somehow we went from I love my girlfriend so much to fuck you, Maisie, fuck you right
1555840	1556840	in your earhole.
1556840	1561200	She knows I love her, I bought her a pink leather collar.
1561200	1563040	I love Maisie, too, she's great.
1563040	1567680	I'm sorry, I have one last fuck you of the week, and that's to Gears of War for hypnotizing
1567680	1568680	my boyfriend.
1568680	1571600	He never wants to leave the fucking Best Buy.
1571600	1574200	Oh, Gears of War, awwww.
1574200	1575200	So yeah.
1575200	1576200	Anyone else?
1576200	1578080	I need a new boyfriend, any volunteers?
1578080	1579920	It's a popular game.
1579920	1585600	Well, I don't swing that way, but like, I'll pose in pictures and stuff so you can tell
1585600	1588920	your family that, you know, I've, what, at Disneyland?
1588920	1593680	Yeah, I remember that girl of my friends that met you, she asked, she's like, is that Jamie's
1593680	1594680	husband?
1594680	1596800	That was the best thing ever.
1596800	1597800	Who?
1597800	1598800	Carolyn.
1598800	1599800	Oh, my stalker.
1599800	1603640	Carolyn, your little stalker, asked if Rob, I don't know.
1603640	1604960	Yeah, apparently I was Jamie's husband.
1604960	1608800	Apparently you were Jamie's husband, I'm sorry, Rob, I love you to death, but you're gay and
1608800	1609800	you act it!
1609800	1610800	How could you?
1610800	1611800	I am not gay!
1611800	1612800	What are you talking about?
1612800	1616400	How can anyone mistake you for her husband?
1616400	1617400	Sorry.
1617400	1619400	Alright, I'm done.
1619400	1620400	Alright.
1620400	1621400	Back to gaming news.
1621400	1623880	Because they couldn't hear him talk in the picture.
1623880	1632120	In fact, on my Myspace, Chris left me a comment where I'm holding the gay lightsaber from
1632120	1633120	Disneyland because it was a-
1633120	1635000	I had it in my bin once.
1635000	1636880	It says, use the gay force, Rob.
1636880	1640000	Oh, I need to add that to my pictures now that I have 300 pictures, so I'm going to
1640000	1641000	do that.
1641000	1642000	Alright, sorry.
1642000	1644560	Gaming news, anybody, somebody, help!
1644560	1650720	Anyways, so out of all the retarded shit that come out for gamers, this has to be up there
1650720	1652600	with some of them.
1652600	1661760	Headshot, the energy bar, yes, you too can buy a fucking energy bar called Headshot and
1661760	1667640	be super cool because you eat fucking energy bars that have to do with gaming, while you're
1667640	1668640	gaming.
1668640	1670800	Ooh, you're fucking awesome.
1670800	1675240	And you know, while you're at it, why don't you wash that headshot down with some balls.
1675240	1678760	Dude, that sounds like fun!
1678760	1686880	Come on, Shami, I know I'm your husband, but can I drink some balls?
1686880	1691000	You know, we should tell Mr. Spanky about it, Rob.
1691000	1693080	We should tell Mr. Spanky about that.
1693080	1699040	Alright, anyhow, yeah, Headshot, wow, that's something else.
1699040	1708320	Oh, and that was the other thing, I believe it was this website, uncommonloot.com, that
1708320	1716160	was running the story about that, and it looks so awful, probably tastes like ass, too.
1716160	1719160	Some people like the taste of ass.
1719160	1723640	You're like ass, well we have the drink for you.
1723640	1728080	Wasn't there a drink on Engrish.com or something that was A-S-S-E or something?
1728080	1731440	No, it was a type of candy.
1731440	1732920	Macari Sweat's actually really good.
1732920	1735920	Wait, what was it going to say?
1735920	1736920	What was it?
1736920	1740520	Oh, Rob D. in chat said, if Rob and Jamie were married, one of them would be dead by
1740520	1742560	now.
1742560	1743560	So true.
1743560	1744560	That would be Rob.
1744560	1745560	So true.
1745560	1746560	Well, really.
1746560	1753200	Anyhow, let's get into some PC gaming news, because I know it's been a pretty interesting
1753200	1756960	show tonight with some very random stuff, but there's nothing more hardcore than PC
1756960	1762080	gaming, because seriously, PC gamer fans are foaming at the mouth hardcore, not that there's
1762080	1763880	anything wrong with that.
1763880	1765840	Myst Online went live this week.
1765840	1768720	This is a game a lot of folks have been like, ooh, even Marissa's gassed me there.
1768720	1770880	No, Myst is not dead.
1770880	1776240	Through the service GameTap, you can play Myst Online, it's $9.95 a month for GameTap,
1776240	1779520	and you get access to hundreds of games, not just this.
1779520	1782440	It launched on February 15th.
1782440	1787120	Right now, it's only available to GameTap subscribers, but apparently, they're going
1787120	1792040	to make the game available as a direct download in other countries, because right now GameTap's
1792040	1795600	only available in the US and Canada, and there's folks overseas that want to play this game.
1795600	1798280	Australia, Japan, wherever they are, they want to play this game as well.
1798280	1802120	So they're looking into options, Turner, who runs GameTap.
1802120	1803120	So that's pretty awesome.
1803120	1805240	That's so great to hear about Myst so many years later.
1805240	1806240	I can't believe it's still around.
1806240	1809640	I mean, I heard about the sequels, but it is kind of funny, though, since the original
1809640	1814640	game is very solitary and very lonely, and now you're communicating with other people.
1814640	1817680	I have the parody version, though, pissed.
1817680	1818680	Wow.
1818680	1821040	No, I actually really want to check this out.
1821040	1824960	I'm going to really try to play this and review it for next week's show, because I keep saying,
1824960	1825960	oh, I've got to play Sam and Max.
1825960	1830760	I really need to spend some quality time with GameTap, but I keep going back to wow, because
1830760	1831760	it's crack.
1831760	1832760	Huh?
1832760	1833760	Add it.
1833760	1834760	Or crack.
1834760	1835760	Sorry.
1835760	1840440	Anyway, well, just a little bit of information.
1840440	1846080	For fans of Gears of War who have a PC, it's eventually going to be on the PC.
1846080	1852200	It was actually confirmed by Epyc's VP, Mark Raine, said that it's not just a rumor, it's
1852200	1854240	going to happen, just not soon.
1854240	1857220	They just said it's inevitable.
1857220	1858560	I guess it's not a really big surprise.
1858560	1862440	I mean, you know, it's one of Microsoft's biggest, if they want more people to come
1862440	1866560	over to the PC bandwagon, you know, why not put something out for those that don't have
1866560	1867560	the 360.
1867560	1869680	Gears of War is a huge title.
1869680	1870680	Makes perfect sense.
1870680	1873720	I don't know why it took them this long to simply acknowledge it.
1873720	1879100	Anyways, so there's going to be a brand new action-oriented role-playing game coming
1879100	1881000	out to the PC.
1881000	1887080	Silver Fall by Atari and Monte Cristo Games is finally gone gold.
1887080	1892360	It's scheduled to be released on March 20th and will retail for $39.95.
1892360	1897560	It actually looks pretty cool, kind of a little fantasy mixed with technology type of role-playing
1897560	1898560	game.
1898560	1899720	It's kind of like a Final Fantasy.
1899720	1906280	Plus, the cover has boobs on it, so you got to buy it because of the boobies, you know.
1906280	1908280	What do you think, Jamie?
1908280	1910280	Let me see.
1910280	1916320	Not bad, she probably has back problems.
1916320	1926280	Well, if you've been wanting to make a boob out of yourself, you might want to check out
1926280	1933240	Rayman Raving Rabbids on the Xbox 360 because it's going to be using the vision camera.
1933240	1939240	There will be gesture-based games for 37 of the minigames in Rayman Raving Rabbids.
1939240	1942400	So that's, I guess, its answer to, you know, the Wii, because it's not going to have the
1942400	1944440	Wii controls, so that's something a little different.
1944440	1945440	So there you have it.
1945440	1948320	You know, where the Wii does not have a camera, now you're going to get this on the Xbox 360.
1948320	1949320	That's going to be interesting.
1949320	1950320	That's going to work fantastic.
1950320	1951320	Yeah, I know.
1951320	1958840	Those camera games are not that great, but Rayman Raving Rabbids doesn't exactly have
1958840	1963520	a lot of, like, I would think in translating some of those games, there's not a lot of
1963520	1967600	motion-intensive stuff in that game, you know what I mean?
1967600	1971040	Like I can't imagine there would be that much motion.
1971040	1973720	There's a lot of motion going on in that game.
1973720	1976160	Never mind, forget it.
1976160	1977160	Just don't buy it.
1977160	1978160	It's a horrible game.
1978160	1979160	Alright, I'll do that.
1979160	1980160	I'll do that.
1980160	1981160	Let's see.
1981160	1988960	Let's go on to Dark Sockra's website of the week.
1988960	1991880	I was reading, I was trying to see if there was good chat comments, sorry if I sounded
1991880	1992880	a spy track.
1992880	1993880	No, they're talking about breasts.
1993880	1994880	They're all talking about boobs.
1994880	2001160	Although, I do have to say, like, holy shit, it's Boobs Get in the Car from GS68.
2001160	2003800	My rebuttal to that was going to the Boobs BRB.
2003800	2008240	Alright, well, I also want to hear your rebuttal to the website of the week, because every
2008240	2013280	week Dark Sockra surfs the website up and down and left and right to find her favorite
2013280	2014280	website.
2014280	2016160	I don't know if it will be Doctor Who related this week.
2016160	2017280	We will soon find out.
2017280	2018280	Here we go.
2018280	2020280	Yes, she does surf the website up and down.
2020280	2022280	Did I say the web?
2022280	2023280	Shut up.
2023280	2027280	The website of the week is the Orange Dogs Radio Forum.
2027280	2028280	No.
2028280	2033360	You know, Rob, Rob, stop the music, stop the music.
2033360	2041240	The website of the week is very personal to me, very important, and you know, I think
2041240	2045520	that we're forgetting the presence of greatness in our lives.
2045520	2051960	We should all bow down and pay homage to our Lord and Master, the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
2051960	2057040	Bless him, he has fostered us, Robin!
2057040	2059920	Oh my God, yes!
2059920	2065160	So the site dedicated to our noodley Lord and Master...
2065160	2070920	I am a pasta-fari, and I must confess, blessed be his noodley goodness, ramen.
2070920	2071920	The site is...
2071920	2075240	What the fuck happened to this show?
2075240	2078360	Seriously, what fucking show am I on?
2078360	2081360	In the name of the noodle, I beseech thee to shut the fuck up.
2081360	2082360	I love carbohydrates.
2082360	2084560	Carbohydrates are so good.
2084560	2092360	The site is www.venganza.org.
2092360	2101340	For a little bit of history, the great one was discovered through a series of detections
2101340	2105320	along the same lines as Intelligent Design.
2105320	2110160	And if Intelligent Design can't exist, why can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster?
2110160	2114880	Just for a brief commercial for pasta-farianism, our heaven has a beer volcano and a stripper
2114880	2121040	factory.
2121040	2129180	So I recommend that everybody, or just worship the IPU, whatever, just go visit the site
2129180	2135640	and soon you will become one of us, because hey, if, you know, Scientology exists, why
2135640	2137520	can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster?
2137520	2142240	Wait, there's actually a million dollar prize if you can prove that the Flying Spaghetti
2142240	2143920	Monster does not exist.
2143920	2144920	There's no way to do it.
2144920	2145920	No.
2145920	2148720	In fact, there's tons of photographic evidence on the site.
2148720	2150320	Yeah, like drawings.
2150320	2151320	So...
2151320	2153040	No, there's real life pictures.
2153040	2158360	If we go out to dinner at the Olive Garden, and I decide I don't like my food, because
2158360	2161160	Olive Garden's food does taste a little bit, you know, rank.
2161160	2164160	It's an insult to Italians.
2164160	2168200	Did you ever see that episode with the Playboy Bunnies, and they asked the Playboy Bunny,
2168200	2169200	what was that show?
2169200	2170200	Hugh Hefner Knows Best or something?
2170200	2171200	Playboy Knows Best?
2171200	2172200	I don't remember what it was.
2172200	2175120	And they asked the one Playboy Boy and what her favorite Italian restaurant is, and she
2175120	2178000	says the Olive Garden, and everybody's like, oh my god, what the hell's wrong?
2178000	2182320	So anyway, if I were to, like, get upset with my food and pick up a big hunk of spaghetti
2182320	2186080	and throw it at Jamie, could I yell Flying Spaghetti Monster and everything would be
2186080	2187160	okay?
2187160	2188160	Because we have...
2188160	2189160	This has the best Valentine on it.
2189160	2191000	It says, I love you, but you must die.
2191000	2197280	Bob, the best part about Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is that we have flimsy moral standards.
2197280	2198800	Can I get gay married in Pastafarian?
2198800	2199800	Absolutely.
2199800	2200800	Absolutely.
2200800	2201800	Can't you be ordained in Pastafarian?
2201800	2205920	Well, you can be ordained in anything, God bless Pastafarian.
2205920	2206920	That's it.
2206920	2209280	I'm a registered minister in California.
2209280	2211960	Wasn't that from an episode of South Park?
2211960	2216600	By the end of March, I will be an ordained minister of Pastafarianism.
2216600	2217600	Wait a minute.
2217600	2222680	This is an episode of South Park where Mrs. Garrison says something about the Flying Spaghetti
2222680	2223680	Monster.
2223680	2224680	I remember this distinctly.
2224680	2225680	The Flying Spaghetti Monster.
2225680	2228400	It came about when someone was trying...
2228400	2229720	The whole thing with the...
2229720	2230720	Intelligent design.
2230720	2231720	Intelligent design.
2231720	2235200	You know, God invented the earth and that kind of thing, and they're trying to teach
2235200	2237000	it in schools.
2237000	2238000	It's like, that's bullshit.
2238000	2239000	It's not science.
2239000	2240000	Whatever.
2240000	2242340	You may believe it's not science.
2242340	2243340	There's nothing to back it up.
2243340	2247480	So these guys said, well, shit, we might as well have a pasta creature that can fly around
2247480	2249440	and has a beer volcano in it.
2249440	2255200	And they used the same type of disjointed argument, the intelligent design.
2255200	2259120	Every time you talk about a Spaghetti Monster, I think about Pizza the Hutt from Spaceballs.
2259120	2260120	Yeah!
2260120	2261120	That guy scares me.
2261120	2262120	He ate himself.
2262120	2268440	I actually think that Pizza the Hutt is one of the avatars of his noodly goodness.
2268440	2270920	It was fully inspired, I think.
2270920	2273120	It's a funny sight.
2273120	2274560	Go see it, God damn it.
2274560	2278680	I have been touched by the noodly appendage.
2278680	2284520	I think next week, we'll be changing the name of the show from Orange Lounge Radio Video
2284520	2288080	Game Radio to Orange Lounge Radio from What the Fuck Ever.
2288080	2289080	Sorry, Rob.
2289080	2290080	No, it's all right.
2290080	2291080	It's funny.
2291080	2293080	I'm not going to be on the show next week, so it's okay.
2293080	2294080	No, it's all right.
2294080	2297080	Last week was just as bad.
2297080	2300120	You know, folks in chat seem to be digging it, so whatever.
2300120	2302440	As long as they're happy, Rob.
2302440	2303440	As long as they're happy.
2303440	2305200	I love you, Jamie!
2305200	2306200	That's right.
2306200	2307200	As long as the masses are pleased.
2307200	2309440	I mean, we can't talk about video games all day long.
2309440	2311880	I mean, you have to have a life outside of games.
2311880	2312880	Really?
2312880	2315080	Or else when will you ever get an orgasm?
2315080	2316080	Seriously.
2316080	2317080	Whee!
2317080	2318080	Whee!
2318080	2319080	I found that.
2319080	2320080	I'm not going to say that on air.
2320080	2323080	But we are going to get back into some gaming news.
2323080	2324080	Are we?
2324080	2325080	Loki?
2325080	2326080	Yes?
2326080	2328080	Yes, if someone gives me a microphone.
2328080	2331400	Anyways, so that wonderful game that I've been playing, Crackdown.
2331400	2334720	It only has 900 achievement points.
2334720	2336240	It is missing 100 of them.
2336240	2340120	I know, everyone pause.
2340120	2345360	That's tragic news, but they are coming later on in a free downloadable thing.
2345360	2349380	What they're going to be doing for the last 100 points, well, they don't really know yet.
2349380	2353180	What they're doing is watching how people play the game, kind of like a Big Brother
2353180	2357440	sort of thing, and they're going to figure out some achievements based on that.
2357440	2363760	So for example, if you're into say, kicking objects really high into the air with your
2363760	2369800	character, like say pipes on a rooftop, into oncoming traffic or stuff like that, that
2369800	2371720	could become an achievement later on.
2371720	2376080	Or I don't know, punting people over a bridge or something, I don't know.
2376080	2380860	As long as there's not some dumbass achievement for 1,000 people in the lobby at once.
2380860	2382880	I don't think there is a lobby in this game.
2382880	2385160	I know, but I'm making reference to that one.
2385160	2386160	Yes, that's retarded.
2386160	2387160	That was stupid.
2387160	2388160	Do you know why they did that?
2388160	2391040	Because they were hoping they sold 1,000 copies of NBA Live or something.
2391040	2393480	Well apparently they did, because the community came together and got it done.
2393480	2394480	Good job.
2394480	2395480	Yeah, worldwide.
2395480	2398920	I don't know.
2398920	2401720	All bought by Achievement Point Horse.
2401720	2404880	To be honest though, Crackdown's achievements, they're not that hard.
2404880	2406880	They're pretty easy.
2406880	2413660	Well, I know Loki likes Crackdown a whole lot, but there's only a few things I can think
2413660	2416000	of that are even better than Crackdown, Loki must agree.
2416000	2432240	Now one of them would be zombies, and there's only one thing better than zombies, believe
2432240	2436040	it or not, and that would be Hideo Kojima.
2436040	2442880	Would you believe that the meeting of this awesomeness, these two worlds of awesome could
2442880	2453400	be in the near future?
2453400	2456240	The zombie idea I have is a bit different.
2456240	2459400	Imagine a large town where half the inhabitants are zombies.
2459400	2462440	Users would subscribe, get inside the town, and get bitten.
2462440	2465560	At that stage they become undead and can't control their character.
2465560	2467660	All they can do is modify the camera angles.
2467660	2471160	They would see their character attacking humans and have to pay to just watch.
2471160	2474920	The only way they could end it is by opening another account, hunting themselves down and
2474920	2476340	killing themselves.
2476340	2479360	Of course, the problem is that your second character can get bitten as well.
2479360	2482320	Wasn't this already done in a Resident Evil game?
2482320	2485960	I think of Infected for PSP for some reason.
2485960	2488960	I want to say a Resident Evil game that was played online.
2488960	2489960	Outbreak?
2489960	2494560	Yeah, I think it might have been Outbreak, where if you did get bitten or whatever,
2494560	2496820	that you wouldn't be able to control your character or something like that.
2496820	2500960	I want to say that that was Outbreak.
2500960	2505280	Well Hideo Kojima says, quote, he's going to take some time to prepare a zombie title
2505280	2506440	if the timing's right.
2506440	2507440	Just take that very seriously.
2507440	2510260	Listen, here's what you need to do, and I'm telling you, this is going to be way better
2510260	2512560	than that stupid zombie game.
2512560	2519080	Okay, Hideo Kojima's Adventures in Nudie Island, because you're going to have, picture this,
2519080	2524160	half the residents, hot naked chicks, okay?
2524160	2528680	You would have people subscribing four times just to have four different people in this
2528680	2533840	fucking island, and I tell you, that is going to be better than any fucking zombie game
2533840	2534840	ever.
2534840	2535840	Beauty and the Geek MMO?
2535840	2536840	And you know what happens?
2536840	2542880	And if you get bitten by the naked chicks, if you're into that kind of thing, then you
2542880	2544560	turn into another naked chick or something.
2544560	2548720	Isn't the downside, though, that half of those quote-unquote naked chicks are men playing
2548720	2550720	as naked chicks?
2550720	2554160	That would be me.
2554160	2558360	I always play women in MMOs, always.
2558360	2563400	That's why, I don't know, the naked chicks would be only controlled by AI, so it'd never
2563400	2564400	be men playing.
2564400	2567120	Oh, so you're never actually having real sex, ever?
2567120	2569720	It doesn't matter, you're never having real sex in this game anyways.
2569720	2572480	If you want real sex, go and fucking get a woman.
2572480	2576080	Festering Rash in our chat, which I believe is just DMN under a different name, says,
2576080	2578360	Loki, it's called Second Life.
2578360	2579520	Oh!
2579520	2580520	Touche.
2580520	2590280	What they need to do is seriously, Tecmo needs to partner with Girls Gone Wild in his fucking
2590280	2599320	DOA Xtreme 3, or Girls Gone Wild- Who's that guy who makes Dead or Alive, Itagaki?
2599320	2604360	Oh my god, he needs to do something like, how much do I have to pay him, though, to
2604360	2606160	put in a little gay content?
2606160	2611000	Not lesbians, sorry Chris, but like, you know, a hardcore, like, guy-on-guy action.
2611000	2613000	Did you say sorry to me?
2613000	2614000	No, I said Chris.
2614000	2616640	Because it's probably Shane, like- No, not Shane, I'm sorry you're here.
2616640	2618040	I'm sorry you're here.
2618040	2619040	Alright.
2619040	2621760	I love one-sided conversations on the radio.
2621760	2622760	So professional.
2622760	2625880	Anyhow, shall we move on?
2625880	2626920	Why not?
2626920	2633280	You know what, I have better things to do, no I'm kidding.
2633280	2642980	For everybody who was into Amplitude, who played Amplitude Online, Sony is giving the
2642980	2646360	online server the boot right at the ass.
2646360	2652240	The Amplitude online server is going away.
2652240	2656160	It will be, I believe actually was down now.
2656160	2658680	It went off on Sunday, right?
2658680	2660920	I think today was the last hurrah.
2660920	2663960	7pm Eastern Time, so it's gone already.
2663960	2666080	Aw, that's sad, kinda.
2666080	2671280	That's so sad that a game that's a few years old loses its online content.
2671280	2673520	Buy a new game!
2673520	2676280	How about they make one as good as Amplitude?
2676280	2677420	That would be awesome.
2677420	2681360	Give me Guitar Hero Online.
2681360	2682360	You jerk.
2682360	2686720	I don't care if Marissa hates Guitar Hero, I'd play it.
2686720	2688680	I liked Amplitude and I did play it online.
2688680	2692120	Of course, not two years.
2692120	2694320	Lately I have, Chris.
2694320	2697760	Okay, this is not the Let's Cry About Rob Not Getting Laid show.
2697760	2699080	Hey, guess what?
2699080	2700080	What?
2700080	2707120	If you thought that Gran Turismo HD was an awesome preview of what Gran Turismo 5 may
2707120	2711560	be someday, whenever the fuck it comes out, well guess what?
2711560	2717920	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is coming out later this year and it's supposed to be yet another
2717920	2721720	fucking demo of what Gran Turismo 5 is gonna be.
2721720	2722720	Hurrah.
2722720	2728560	And actually, they were saying that if, I think the original Gran Turismo 4 Prologue,
2728560	2730600	you actually have to buy that.
2730600	2735540	So I don't know, great, another fucking demo of Gran Turismo.
2735540	2736540	Guess what?
2736540	2737540	The first one sucked.
2737540	2738540	I didn't like it.
2738540	2741400	And the second one, probably not gonna download it.
2741400	2744520	Gran Turismo 5, probably not gonna buy it.
2744520	2749120	So hooray.
2749120	2754260	James Patrick in chat, commenting on the MMO thing, says a Mass Effect will probably have
2754260	2755260	gay romance.
2755260	2756800	Is Skye looking forward to that?
2756800	2761200	No, because as I said earlier, I always play chicks and MMOs because everybody's nicer
2761200	2764800	to you when you're a chick in an MMO and I don't wanna do a lesbian thing.
2764800	2765800	That's gross.
2765800	2767800	Yeah, World of Warcraft people.
2767800	2770520	Yeah, first of all, fuck you.
2770520	2772520	Second of all- Right now?
2772520	2774680	Yeah, right now, Rob.
2774680	2778720	Punch fans back on.
2778720	2780880	There's our random ahh from Exeter.
2780880	2785520	Don't tell anyone that you're a lesbian on WoW, or that you have a character, because
2785520	2789260	I swear to God, they will not shut up.
2789260	2793160	All the guys around you will go, ooh, lesbians, cool.
2793160	2797720	And everybody else will go, that's against God.
2797720	2800840	Noobs.
2800840	2805080	I just think that's a part of the history of the internets, because my father, when
2805080	2810440	we had prodigy internet, went with his guy friend, who was a teacher, went into a lesbian
2810440	2815560	chat room and went, hi, lesies, and were immediately booted because everybody knew they were straight.
2815560	2820440	It's just something about the internet that makes people retarded with that stuff.
2820440	2824960	My father, for God's sake.
2824960	2830400	I almost wanna make a gay.com account right now, impersonating us a woman.
2830400	2835960	I'll put Chris' picture as my profile or something, and go into a chat room and put, hey, lesies.
2835960	2837840	See what happens.
2837840	2844560	We were gonna do that for my ex-boyfriend, who is so totally gay, as an April Fools joke,
2844560	2846520	put his profile and his address.
2846520	2847520	That's so wrong.
2847520	2848520	That's so wrong.
2848520	2849840	Oh, and one of the gay dating sites.
2849840	2852160	He needs help admitting his gayness.
2852160	2855360	Yeah, he needs, he's just, yeah, okay.
2855360	2856360	This show is very gay.
2856360	2858320	The first step is admitting you're gay.
2858320	2859320	Well we already did that.
2859320	2862280	We would like to take your live calls right now on our Skype line.
2862280	2866200	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, straight, gay, pre-op, who cares?
2866200	2867200	We don't care.
2867200	2868760	Come be gay with us.
2868760	2869760	Yeah.
2869760	2871560	Come talk to us about whatever topic you want.
2871560	2874880	Maybe there's a topic we've already talked about on the show that you wanna elaborate
2874880	2875880	on.
2875880	2879160	Maybe there's something new we haven't talked about yet that you'd like to share with us.
2879160	2881080	It's all in your court right now.
2881080	2885760	Also, 1-877-GAME-OLR is only local in the United States and Canada, meaning that's where
2885760	2886880	it's only toll free.
2886880	2892040	If you are abroad in another country, we encourage you to download Skype and call us on our username,
2892040	2894480	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
2894480	2896520	They're all gonna call in for Maritha.
2896520	2897760	We'll see what happens.
2897760	2899920	Let's go to the first call, boys and girls.
2899920	2901920	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2901920	2902920	Who's this?
2902920	2905520	Did I not actually pick up a call?
2905520	2906520	My bad.
2906520	2907520	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2907520	2908520	Who's this?
2908520	2909520	It's Dark Tetsuya.
2909520	2910520	Hi, Dark Tetsuya.
2910520	2911520	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
2911520	2912520	I don't know, not much.
2912520	2913520	I'm just calling in to say hi.
2913520	2917600	You just wanted to say hi to Maritha?
2917600	2918600	Is that it?
2918600	2919600	No.
2919600	2920600	Yeah.
2920600	2921600	Oh, thank God.
2921600	2922600	What are you wearing?
2922600	2923600	Well, no.
2923600	2924600	I so want groupies.
2924600	2925600	Why do only men get groupies?
2925600	2926600	I want groupies.
2926600	2927600	Are you kidding?
2927600	2928600	This woman has so many groupies.
2928600	2929600	That's because she's hot.
2929600	2930600	Are you a Dark Sakura groupie, DT?
2930600	2931600	Say no.
2931600	2932600	My husband won't let you down.
2932600	2933600	Kind of.
2933600	2934600	He says kind of.
2934600	2946520	Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, not at all.
2946520	2947520	Dan will step on you.
2947520	2949600	He's a groupie that respects boundaries.
2949600	2950600	Yeah.
2950600	2951600	That's fair.
2951600	2952600	I prefer fanboys.
2952600	2953600	All right.
2953600	2955600	Well, what kind of games you been playing this week, Dark Tetsuya?
2955600	2958640	Just step on the lead.
2958640	2959640	I'm trying.
2959640	2962280	There must have been something that compelled you to pick up the phone and call in.
2962280	2966160	Was there a story tonight that particularly touched a nerve with you?
2966160	2968640	Well, the AOU stuff.
2968640	2972640	Ah, the arcade stuff we talked about in part A, like the Silent Hill game and DDR Super
2972640	2973640	Nova.
2973640	2974640	What do you think of all that?
2974640	2975640	Sounds pretty cool.
2975640	2978800	I'm hooked about Super Nova 2.
2978800	2979800	Yeah.
2979800	2985280	Did you think Super Nova was a real, like, was it, did it kind of rescue the DDR series
2985280	2986800	or?
2986800	2987800	I think so.
2987800	2989120	Very cool.
2989120	2991760	What features would you like to see new in Super Nova 2?
2991760	2995640	I mean, just new songs, or what would you like to see Konami do with Super Nova 2?
2995640	3001120	Well, affecting the new songs, they should probably put in the link mode.
3001120	3003000	Ah, link mode.
3003000	3007280	Ah, so like you can use your memory card from the home version on the arcade.
3007280	3008280	That's a good idea.
3008280	3010000	Hopefully it'll happen.
3010000	3012000	Do you like to track your data?
3012000	3013000	Yeah.
3013000	3019840	Act Deft, who changed his name to Act Deft Marissa Fan in chat, says, remember to put
3019840	3020840	in link mode.
3020840	3021840	Very cool.
3021840	3022840	Very cool.
3022840	3025720	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dr. Tzuyu?
3025720	3028400	I just thought that Silent Hill game was cool.
3028400	3029400	Yeah, it does.
3029400	3033360	What, what, what, do you think Silent Hill's going to work as a first person shooter?
3033360	3034360	It might.
3034360	3037640	I guess we'll see when we play the game, huh?
3037640	3038640	Yeah.
3038640	3040240	Do you think the graphics look okay?
3040240	3045160	I mean, Dark Chakra was kind of knocking the graphics earlier, saying that, you know, PlayStation
3045160	3046160	2 had better graphics.
3046160	3047160	What do you think?
3047160	3048160	Right.
3048160	3051200	No, no, they look pretty good.
3051200	3052200	Kind of atmospheric.
3052200	3053200	Atmospheric.
3053200	3054200	Yeah.
3054200	3055200	All right.
3055200	3056200	Well, Dr. Tzuyu, thanks so much for your call.
3056200	3058360	We've got to take some other calls, though, but have a good one, okay, buddy?
3058360	3059360	I will.
3059360	3060360	Yeah.
3060360	3061360	All right.
3061360	3062360	Later.
3062360	3066040	We welcome your calls right now at 916 anymore.
3066040	3070800	And I almost gave my home phone number, 877-GAME-OLR.
3070800	3072200	It's 877-GAME-OLR.
3072200	3073200	Let's go to another call.
3073200	3074200	Hi.
3074200	3075200	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3075200	3076200	Who's this?
3076200	3077200	Hey, it's Seisha.
3077200	3078200	Hi.
3078200	3079200	I just told you to call.
3079200	3080200	What's on your mind?
3080200	3081200	Wow, that was fast.
3081200	3082200	What's on your mind, Seisha?
3082200	3083200	No.
3083200	3086800	I think Silent Hill's going to suck as a first-person shooter.
3086800	3089800	Why do you think it's going to suck as a first-person shooter?
3089800	3090800	I don't know.
3090800	3095760	It's just not going to be, like, atmospheric enough, I don't think.
3095760	3099960	Do you think it's going to fall into the same pattern that the Resident Evil gun survivor
3099960	3100960	games did?
3100960	3101960	Yes.
3101960	3102960	Definitely.
3102960	3104880	You know, I actually liked the second one.
3104880	3113120	I got to play the Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, and I thought it was pretty cool, but I'm
3113120	3115880	really trying to reserve my judgment for actually playing it.
3115880	3117800	I just love Silent Hill.
3117800	3120440	Mmm, but nah.
3120440	3124000	I like the atmosphere and the whole ambience about it.
3124000	3125880	I don't think it'll work.
3125880	3130440	What do you think would make it cool?
3130440	3132480	Apart from Pyramid Head.
3132480	3136680	But it has nurses.
3136680	3137680	I don't know.
3137680	3141960	I'm just not a really big fan of first-person shooters, I guess.
3141960	3147240	So if you were going to design a Silent Hill arcade game, how would you make it?
3147240	3151560	I probably wouldn't make one, to be honest.
3151560	3153200	Fair enough.
3153200	3160080	All right, well, I think you have a fan here in studio who wanted to say hello to you,
3160080	3163120	Asatia, since you called in.
3163120	3166520	Hi, hot, sexy British guy.
3166520	3167960	That's Rice Princess, by the way.
3167960	3168960	Hey, Rice Princess.
3168960	3169960	How's it going?
3169960	3170960	I'm really tired, actually.
3170960	3171960	It's 5 a.m.
3171960	3172960	Oh, my God.
3172960	3173960	Aw, and he stayed up to listen to us.
3173960	3174960	I know, wasn't I?
3174960	3175960	No, to listen to us, Rice Princess, not you.
3175960	3176960	Okay, I'm going to go and not cry in a corner.
3176960	3177960	Not true.
3177960	3178960	He did ask about her earlier.
3178960	3179960	Aw, that's so sweet.
3179960	3180960	And he's all sexy.
3180960	3181960	You guys should add each other on there.
3181960	3193360	Oh, my God, we totally should.
3193360	3194840	Do you use MySpace, Asatia?
3194840	3196400	Yeah, I do.
3196400	3202120	Oh, type it to Skye in the chat room.
3202120	3203120	He's on my friends list.
3203120	3204120	Oh, is he?
3204120	3205120	Mm-hmm.
3205120	3206120	Really?
3206120	3207120	Yeah.
3207120	3208120	Well, no.
3208120	3209120	Hey.
3209120	3210120	All right.
3210120	3211120	Well, there you go.
3211120	3212120	Who's online?
3212120	3213120	Are you?
3213120	3214120	No.
3214120	3215120	Okay.
3215120	3216120	All right.
3216120	3217120	There you go.
3217120	3218120	Sweet.
3218120	3219120	All right.
3219120	3220120	Because she loves Silent Hill and could talk all about the first-person games with you,
3220120	3221120	I guess.
3221120	3222120	I don't know.
3222120	3223120	Yeah.
3223120	3224120	All right.
3224120	3225120	She might convince me.
3225120	3226120	All right.
3226120	3227120	Oh, there you go.
3227120	3228120	Oh, hey.
3228120	3229120	All right.
3229120	3230120	So I've got a bet going now.
3230120	3231120	Why?
3231120	3232120	What's that?
3232120	3233120	I bet Irene can convince.
3233120	3234120	Oh, man.
3234120	3235120	Okay.
3235120	3236120	I'll give you $50.
3236120	3237120	No, I'm kidding.
3237120	3239120	Which is like next to nothing in pounds, right?
3239120	3240120	I know.
3240120	3241120	Totally nothing at all.
3241120	3243120	So I guess you're kind of losing out there.
3243120	3244120	All right.
3244120	3248120	Well, as much as I'd love to keep the OLR love connection going, we've got to get the
3248120	3249120	show moving.
3249120	3251120	Sesha, you're a good sport.
3251120	3253120	Thanks for calling in and staying up so late.
3253120	3254120	You're a true fan.
3254120	3255120	We love you.
3255120	3256120	See you, guys.
3256120	3257120	All right.
3257120	3258120	Take care, buddy.
3258120	3261120	Bye, sexy British guy.
3261120	3262120	Have you ever even seen a picture?
3262120	3263120	No, I don't care.
3263120	3264120	He sounds hot.
3264120	3265120	He's cute.
3265120	3266120	That's very not superficial of you.
3266120	3267120	That's very nice.
3267120	3268120	I know.
3268120	3269120	Yeah.
3269120	3270120	He sounds really hot, dude.
3270120	3271120	I saw his picture.
3271120	3272120	He's cute.
3272120	3273120	Is he?
3273120	3274120	Note to all guys.
3274120	3275120	I think he's cute.
3275120	3277120	Get fake British accents.
3277120	3285120	Well, next week on Orange Ounce Radio, we're going to be talking about Rod puppets.
3285120	3287120	Instant softie there.
3287120	3288120	Hello.
3288120	3290120	Is that what I'm doing wrong?
3290120	3292120	Is that why I can't get laid?
3292120	3295120	I love the way you say that.
3295120	3296120	Laid.
3296120	3298120	Is that why I haven't had a date in so long?
3298120	3299120	Your accent is terrible.
3299120	3300120	That was mine.
3300120	3301120	Why am I even trying?
3301120	3304120	Well, let's go to another call, shall we?
3304120	3305120	Better, Rob.
3305120	3309120	Hello, you're Auntie with Orange Ounce Radio.
3309120	3310120	Who's this?
3310120	3311120	Oh, God.
3311120	3313120	That voice turned me on.
3313120	3315120	Hi, DMN.
3315120	3318120	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you.
3318120	3319120	Hi, DMN.
3319120	3320120	Right now.
3320120	3321120	Hi, everybody.
3321120	3322120	Hi.
3322120	3327120	You have to come to my birthday party, you bastard.
3327120	3328120	I'll try.
3328120	3329120	Okay.
3329120	3334120	Something about Crackdown I actually wanted to talk about.
3334120	3339120	I don't know if any of you guys heard, but a Halo 3 demo came with Crackdown.
3339120	3343120	Careful, don't call it a demo.
3343120	3344120	It's a beta.
3344120	3347120	Bill Gates will come sodomize you if you call it a demo.
3347120	3349120	It doesn't come with a demo.
3349120	3351120	It will be available for download later.
3351120	3358120	But here's the thing I don't get is that rabid Halo fanboys who wank off to Master Chief
3358120	3364120	are basically saying, oh, my God, I have to pay $60 to play the beta.
3364120	3365120	It's a beta.
3365120	3366120	No, you don't.
3366120	3370120	You could have done all those other things like registered and be drawn randomly or play
3370120	3376120	Halo 2 for some amount of time and be the first 13,333 people.
3376120	3380120	Or you could unbunch your wedgie and just wait for the real game to come out.
3380120	3381120	And that's what I'm saying.
3381120	3383120	It's a beta test.
3383120	3387120	It's one of the first console games I've ever known of that's having a public beta test.
3387120	3393120	It's like I was saying earlier in the show, even though 11 billion people are in the Halo
3393120	3397120	3 beta, and I'm very sorry to Mike W. who was complaining earlier about being a Halo
3397120	3399120	fan and being like the only person not in the beta.
3399120	3401120	I'm not in the beta either, but I don't care.
3401120	3405120	For some reason, people want to be in this beta because it makes their Internet penis
3405120	3408120	bigger, because it's like I was in the Halo 3 beta.
3408120	3411120	I'm doing half the Internet.
3411120	3414120	It's pretty ridiculous.
3414120	3417120	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, DMN?
3417120	3420120	STFU, we're looking for a guest.
3420120	3423120	Anybody who's listening live would like to be a guest.
3423120	3426120	We're taping Tuesday night, so shoot me an eye.
3426120	3427120	Why don't you have Rice Prince as a guest?
3427120	3428120	Oh, Dark Soccer.
3428120	3431120	I want to, but I'm actually, and I was going to say something about that.
3431120	3434120	I forgot that my class that I thought was Friday is actually on Tuesday.
3434120	3437120	I'm actually taking chakra mapping, metaphysical shit.
3437120	3439120	This is my massage therapy school.
3439120	3440120	Interesting.
3440120	3444120	Do you want me to manipulate your energy, DMN?
3444120	3446120	I don't have any energy today.
3446120	3449120	Why don't you have Marissa on?
3449120	3452120	She's welcome to come on if she wants.
3452120	3454120	Wee!
3454120	3459120	I say you get a bunch of girls on your show this week.
3459120	3460120	Oh, no.
3460120	3463120	And see how you like it when you have more girls than guys on the show.
3463120	3465120	Aww, estrogen fest!
3465120	3467120	I see what you did there.
3467120	3470120	You kind of put your own show name in there.
3470120	3471120	All right.
3471120	3473120	Tune in to SDFU on Thursday nights right here on Orange,
3473120	3475120	Ontario at 7 o'clock Pacific.
3475120	3477120	It's a good time.
3477120	3478120	Usually.
3478120	3479120	Have a good one, DMN.
3479120	3480120	Bye.
3480120	3481120	Bye.
3481120	3482120	Wait, do we have a picture?
3482120	3483120	Wait, is this a picture?
3483120	3484120	Yeah.
3484120	3485120	All right.
3485120	3486120	I want to see the British guy.
3486120	3487120	I know, we all want to see.
3487120	3488120	Rice Princess ran over.
3488120	3489120	Let's see, let's see.
3489120	3490120	Aww.
3490120	3491120	The British guy's hot.
3491120	3493120	He's kind of young.
3493120	3495120	Oh, yeah, but he's still hot.
3495120	3497120	The British guy is hot.
3497120	3499120	You're going to scare the poor guy off.
3499120	3500120	Dude, you're a pimp, man.
3500120	3501120	We all think you're hot.
3501120	3502120	He's never going to come to chat again.
3502120	3503120	Look at his other pictures real quick.
3503120	3504120	All right.
3504120	3506120	Even Shane like randomly appeared under nowhere.
3506120	3508120	I heard something about a British guy.
3508120	3510120	Dude, he's got, okay, that's awesome.
3510120	3512120	He's got very nice eyes.
3512120	3513120	All right.
3513120	3515120	Anyway, can we go to another call?
3515120	3516120	May we please go to another call?
3516120	3517120	All right.
3517120	3518120	Let's go to another call.
3518120	3519120	Hi, you're on Orange, Ontario.
3519120	3521120	Who's this?
3521120	3523120	Hi, Ronma.
3523120	3526120	It's not Ronma.
3526120	3528120	Is this Ronma?
3528120	3530120	Who is it?
3530120	3533120	It's Exoverr calling from the living room.
3533120	3534120	Shut up, Exoverr.
3534120	3536120	It's Exoverr calling from the living room.
3536120	3538120	I'm so not Ronma.
3538120	3540120	That's so funny.
3540120	3542120	Did I sound black?
3542120	3544120	No, I'm totally white.
3544120	3545120	Okay.
3545120	3550120	The few times that I've been on this show and Ronma has called in, he's like scratchy
3550120	3553120	like he's calling from his cell phone because his, what's it called?
3553120	3556120	Get off the fucking phone.
3556120	3558120	Oh, that makes sense.
3558120	3560120	Anyway, bye.
3560120	3562120	Fucker.
3562120	3567120	No cookie.
3567120	3569120	I hate this show.
3569120	3575120	By the way, Marissa, Act of Death is now Act of Death Marissa fans.
3575120	3576120	We got to go to another call.
3576120	3577120	Hi, you're on Orange, Ontario.
3577120	3579120	Who's this?
3579120	3581120	Static.
3581120	3582120	Hello?
3582120	3584120	Can you hear us?
3584120	3585120	Okay.
3585120	3590120	Unfortunately, that caller did not go through and it was a new caller and I feel bad that
3590120	3591120	I had to hang up.
3591120	3592120	No, you don't.
3592120	3597120	Well, you know, I just, you know, I appreciate new people taking the effort to call in, but
3597120	3598120	unfortunately we couldn't hear you.
3598120	3599120	Maybe there was lag or something.
3599120	3601120	Act of Death says heart, Marissa.
3601120	3602120	Heart, you too.
3602120	3605120	Here's also a PSA for any new caller from the show.
3605120	3606120	It was Yumi.
3606120	3607120	I know and that's why I felt bad.
3607120	3608120	Yumi, make your microphone work.
3608120	3609120	It's not what I want to hear from you.
3609120	3610120	Use the power of evil.
3610120	3611120	That's all right.
3611120	3614120	We'll go to another call in the meantime.
3614120	3615120	Hi, you're on Orange, Ontario.
3615120	3616120	Who's this?
3616120	3620120	This is a long time listener, Dark Knight, rising from the dead.
3620120	3621120	Hi, Dark Knight.
3621120	3622120	Hi, it's DK.
3622120	3624120	It's been a long time since we heard from you, buddy.
3624120	3625120	What's on your mind?
3625120	3626120	Uh, nothing much.
3626120	3628120	I thought I might give...
3628120	3629120	Oh, hold on.
3629120	3630120	I know.
3630120	3632120	The feedback is horrible, isn't it?
3632120	3633120	He's my Southern buddy.
3633120	3634120	Okay, I'm good.
3634120	3643120	I just want to give a little mini review on Diddy Kong, because I saw it in the chat room earlier about it.
3643120	3646120	Please do, I haven't played this game yet. I'm curious if I should pick it up.
3646120	3652120	It's okay, but like they said, it's more like a rehash of the N64 version.
3652120	3654120	Really?
3654120	3662120	It seems like a rehash of the N64 version. The only difference is that some of the mini games will incorporate the use of the stylus.
3662120	3670120	Sort of like how Mario on the DS, the launch title, was kind of Mario 64 with some extra frills.
3670120	3675120	Exactly. Like I said, it was more of a rehash, if anything else.
3675120	3680120	Like when you're doing your turbo boost, you know how in the N64 one you usually hit the buttons.
3680120	3687120	To do the turbo boost on this one, you actually have to use the stylus to boost your level up to do the boost.
3687120	3690120	Well, would you recommend the game to others?
3690120	3692120	Yes, no.
3692120	3696120	What was it? Yes, no? Yeah, you know?
3696120	3699120	Yeah, you know.
3699120	3709120	I mean, yes to some, they're hard fans, but if you've never played Diddy Kong before or something like that, you might want to pass.
3709120	3715120	So people that are expecting to play Mario Kart DS Part 2, they're going to be disappointed, you think?
3715120	3718120	Just about if anything else.
3718120	3723120	All right, well, so noted. Anything else you want to comment on on tonight's show?
3723120	3728120	Like I said, it's been a long time calling the show. I've missed talking to you guys at times.
3728120	3733120	Well, we miss having you call in, so feel free to call us anytime. You know where to find us.
3733120	3742120	Yeah, usually though, I'm calling on Travis' show, and he can tell you that I have been in good appearance on that show lately.
3742120	3748120	Travis has a great show, and all the callers just enhance to that show, no matter how good or bad they are, so it's a good time.
3748120	3752120	Especially since he has a NASCAR partner, so yeah.
3752120	3755120	That's Saturday nights on Orange Laundrio, by the way. Check it out, Travis Donovan.
3755120	3758120	All right, Dark Knight, have a good one, and thanks so much for your call.
3758120	3759120	No problem. You have a good night.
3759120	3760120	You too.
3760120	3761120	Later, guys.
3761120	3762120	Bye.
3762120	3763120	Bye.
3763120	3764120	Bye.
3764120	3767120	I like hearing from Dark Knight. I like hearing from all our callers.
3767120	3773120	And if you're wondering, and you're sitting at home and asking yourself, why do the same people call in every week?
3773120	3782120	Because they can. Orange Laundrio is an open forum, and if you are sick and tired of hearing the same people every week on this show, as awesome as they are, you need to start calling in too.
3782120	3788120	And you can do that by listening to us Sunday nights live at 6 o'clock Pacific time, or you can leave us a voicemail at any time during the week.
3788120	3795120	We haven't had a lot of them lately, so we haven't had anything to play, but 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number if you ever want to leave a voicemail.
3795120	3798120	Here on Orange Laundrio, who's this?
3798120	3800120	Hey there. This is Let's Have Tea.
3800120	3804120	Hi. What's Up G? Is that it?
3804120	3805120	Let's Have Tea.
3805120	3808120	Let's Have Tea. I thought he said, What's Up G?
3808120	3810120	Word, yo!
3810120	3814120	Did I fuck up that name? My bad. I actually had a little tea earlier.
3814120	3817120	What's on your mind, Let's Have Tea?
3817120	3824120	I was actually wondering what your thoughts was on the XNA.
3824120	3830120	On XNA, the amateur development studio for Xbox. Anybody have a thought on this?
3830120	3831120	Right.
3831120	3833120	I talk too much on the show, so I'm deferring.
3833120	3836120	I have a thought that I really haven't cared too much about it.
3836120	3840120	But you're not really into the programming stuff. You just want to play the game, right?
3840120	3846120	Oh no, I like seeing the behind the scenes stuff. It's just I'm like, I guess maybe I'm too saturated right now.
3846120	3848120	Yeah, and maybe it's like for you-
3848120	3852120	But I go looking for behind the scenes stuff all the time. I just got done watching the behind the scenes of Silent Hill 3.
3852120	3856120	I think I would love to see XNA allowed.
3856120	3861120	I suppose I could pay the $99 and play some of the games that are going to come out from XNA.
3861120	3867120	But I would like to see something a little more easily accessible where I could play some of the products that XNA creates.
3867120	3872120	Because there's going to be a lot of independent games out there, and I really hope they start to see the light of day.
3872120	3876120	I know it's not going to happen right away, but maybe a little later on in the year and on into 2008,
3876120	3878120	we'll get to start to see some of the products.
3878120	3882120	I know a lick about video game programming. XNA does nothing for me.
3882120	3885120	But I'm excited at the prospect of it's going to make original games.
3885120	3891120	Because there's going to be independent developers, one man, two man, three man teams out there making their own games.
3891120	3897120	I want to see some of those on Xbox Live and see what original content is out there.
3897120	3902120	I mean, look at some of the games that have been developed for the web that are starting to get big now.
3902120	3905120	You have Flow, Line Rider, those types of things.
3905120	3909120	I think XNA could produce more stuff like that.
3909120	3911120	Oh yeah, definitely.
3911120	3914120	Are you an XNA user, Let's Have Team?
3914120	3918120	I'm on a few teams for 3D modeling and such.
3918120	3922120	That's hard stuff.
3922120	3923120	Excuse me?
3923120	3926120	I said that's hard stuff.
3926120	3934120	The 3D modeling is hard stuff.
3934120	3938120	That's alright. We're probably having a little bit of lag.
3938120	3941120	That happens because our internet is getting hammered here.
3941120	3946120	I guess I'll ask you one last question and hopefully you can make this out.
3946120	3950120	What would be your response to this question?
3950120	3954120	What do you hope XNA can accomplish in the next six months or a year?
3954120	3961120	I'm really looking forward to seeing more original content.
3961120	3968120	Because most game developers now are too afraid of making something new rather than just continuing with sequels and such.
3968120	3980120	So XNA will be able to have independent developers and small online teams be able to make something new and original.
3980120	3984120	Alright, well good luck. It sounds like you're doing some of that XNA stuff yourself.
3984120	3988120	So good luck to the things that you're modeling and all that.
3988120	3992120	Let us know if you work on any games that show up.
3992120	3999120	I think that's a good idea because it seems like, to be vulgar as I usually am,
3999120	4004120	that games are just turning into long series of porns with the same name.
4004120	4007120	You know, The Pressed Men 10.
4007120	4009120	Some original games would be nice.
4009120	4015120	Again, I'm not well versed in the PSP at all, but I actually gave it to my ex-boyfriend being very stupid and very broken.
4015120	4019120	I forgot to get him a game as well, but he didn't care because he was excited about everything that was homebrew.
4019120	4026120	I have to say, that is some amazing insight from a casual gamer that games are starting to sound like porn titles.
4026120	4030120	Because you're kind of right, and I've never thought about it that way before, but it's kind of true.
4030120	4032120	Cooking mama.
4032120	4035120	Let's poke mama's steak.
4035120	4039120	Alright, let's have tea.
4039120	4042120	Thanks so much for the call, okay buddy?
4042120	4044120	Of course.
4044120	4046120	Have a good one.
4046120	4048120	I can't believe I called him What's Up G.
4048120	4050120	That's what it sounded like. Am I the one that heard that?
4050120	4052120	I'm not the one that heard that.
4052120	4054120	I don't know.
4054120	4057120	I'm going to try another call here.
4057120	4063120	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
4063120	4065120	Can you hear me? This is Uni.
4065120	4069120	Yes, it's a little lagged, but I can kind of hear you. What's on your mind, Uni?
4069120	4074120	Oh, I was going to ask, how many people play Harvest Moon?
4074120	4076120	Me.
4076120	4078120	I played it once.
4078120	4080120	Who else in here? Anybody else play Harvest Moon?
4080120	4082120	Lesbians love sheep.
4082120	4085120	Anybody?
4085120	4087120	I don't know what that means, but I don't even want to know.
4087120	4089120	I like my plushie from Harvest Moon.
4089120	4090120	But you don't really play the games?
4090120	4091120	Not really.
4091120	4092120	Loki? No, he says no.
4092120	4094120	I used to just watch people play it, and I thought it was amusing.
4094120	4096120	You got one. Are you a Harvest Moon player?
4096120	4106120	Yes, I am. My sister and mom got me Harvest Moon, More Friends of Mineral Town for Christmas.
4106120	4112120	Seriously, that game is like crack.
4112120	4120120	My sister and I would play it just to say, who's going to marry who or something.
4120120	4122120	That's the priorities.
4122120	4127120	Try to sell me on this game for a minute, because I'm not a huge Harvest Moon person.
4127120	4130120	Why should I play Harvest Moon?
4130120	4138120	The first one I played, you are trying to save this town called Mineral Town.
4138120	4147120	Basically, you take three years to sell as many crops as you can, bring as much reputation to the town, which is Mineral Town.
4147120	4150120	Wait, I've got to play this game for three years?
4150120	4159120	No, the days last for about ten minutes, to be totally honest.
4159120	4171120	It's kind of like that with More Friends of Mineral Town, which you're basically playing as a female instead of a male.
4171120	4176120	You can actually marry somebody on that game.
4176120	4182120	You can actually marry men when you're on the women's version, and you can marry a woman on the men's version.
4182120	4184120	It's lame.
4184120	4188120	No gay marriage. Can you partner? Can you get a civil union?
4188120	4191120	No, I'm sorry.
4191120	4194120	We're used to it.
4194120	4198120	One more question for you, even though you're the one that called us.
4198120	4203120	What makes this game different from Animal Crossing?
4203120	4219120	Well, you don't have to go take the pink dresser from Cat Person's house to the dog person and then take a letter to the owl person.
4219120	4223120	You just grow shit and sell it, and then you feed your dog.
4223120	4228120	I don't remember getting the sheep in Harvest Moon to say, you cunt.
4228120	4233120	Am I right?
4233120	4236120	But you do have to comb your horse.
4236120	4238120	Yes, you do.
4238120	4241120	You have to comb it all the time, like every cow.
4241120	4244120	Do you get to tip the cows, though?
4244120	4245120	I don't think you can.
4245120	4247120	Do you tip your cows?
4247120	4248120	No.
4248120	4249120	I don't think they give you that option.
4249120	4252120	I know your name is really simple, but I love it.
4252120	4256120	I just saw a thing with a unicorn today, and I geeked out because I'm a girl.
4256120	4260120	If I remember right, isn't it based off of Yuna from Final Fantasy X?
4260120	4267120	Yes, that was my DDR nickname back when I was playing in Rhode Island.
4267120	4269120	At least your teacher didn't name you.
4269120	4278120	A lot of girls that are into games seem to really enjoy Yuna from Final Fantasy X.
4278120	4280120	She's like a role model for girls.
4280120	4281120	Her boobs aren't big enough.
4281120	4283120	I'm actually a lot like her in real life.
4283120	4284120	You mean she's normal?
4284120	4287120	Yeah, I know. Weird, huh?
4287120	4290120	Not that there's anything wrong with the big boobies.
4290120	4293120	There's nothing wrong with the big boobies at all.
4293120	4297120	Yeah, anyways, I should let you guys go.
4297120	4298120	Yeah, thanks.
4298120	4299120	Thank you for the advice.
4299120	4300120	We love you, Yuni.
4300120	4301120	All right, take care, Yuni.
4301120	4302120	Thanks for the call.
4302120	4303120	We appreciate it.
4303120	4304120	Bye.
4304120	4305120	Bye.
4305120	4306120	All right.
4306120	4307120	I am so pathetic.
4307120	4309120	We'll probably do one more call here on the show.
4309120	4313120	If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR,
4313120	4319120	or you can always call us on the old-fashioned Skype line or whatever you want to do.
4319120	4320120	What was Yuna from?
4320120	4321120	Final Fantasy X.
4321120	4322120	I've not played that game.
4322120	4323120	You should. It's a good game.
4323120	4325120	Well, I haven't been able to pick it up, so that's why.
4325120	4327120	It's like I saw a unicorn today.
4327120	4328120	I was like, unicorns, and I saw her name.
4328120	4329120	A unicorn?
4329120	4331120	That is so fucking pathetic.
4331120	4333120	Wow, you're interesting.
4333120	4334120	Oh, my God.
4334120	4335120	But I love you.
4335120	4337120	All right, let's do at least one more call here.
4337120	4338120	Hi, you're on Orange On The Radio.
4338120	4339120	Who's this?
4339120	4341120	It's Raven's Coffin.
4341120	4342120	Hi, Raven's Coffin.
4342120	4344120	What's on your mind, buddy?
4344120	4347120	I am the saddest attorney in the world.
4347120	4349120	I object to that.
4349120	4350120	Objection.
4350120	4352120	Overruled, motherfucker.
4352120	4353120	I am a legal secretary.
4353120	4354120	Well, thank you.
4354120	4355120	Oh.
4355120	4359120	All right, what is legally on your mind, dude?
4359120	4363120	Well, legally, I did get my hands on Phoenix Wright, Justice For All.
4363120	4365120	What'd you think?
4365120	4366120	I love it.
4366120	4373120	It is kind of like a continuation of the game, but hey, it's Phoenix Wright, and you also
4373120	4374120	pick it up.
4374120	4375120	It's great.
4375120	4377120	Tell me what I'm in for if I've never played Phoenix Wright before.
4377120	4381120	What can I expect from Phoenix Wright, either the first or second one?
4381120	4386120	All right, this one, Phoenix Wright's a text game, so you have to click a lot and read
4386120	4391120	a lot, and you have to find clues and contradictions in the game.
4391120	4395120	And if you don't find things, things get a little hairy.
4395120	4400120	If you mess up and show Judge the wrong kind of evidence, you will go, uh-uh, not true,
4400120	4407120	and he will go bang, and you'll look stupid.
4407120	4410720	What do you think draws, because this is a very cult type of game.
4410720	4414120	Why do you think so many people are drawn to this as like a cult game?
4414120	4420120	Because the story is so insane, and it's like law and order.
4420120	4426120	If you've never played something like this, the story is so driven, it's a very story-driven
4426120	4431120	game, and you want to see how the story is progressing, and you know, like the Edgeworth
4431120	4433120	trial, I'm not going to give away anything.
4433120	4436120	All I'm saying is holy shit, holy shit.
4436120	4439120	So it's got a good story like Law and Order, like an episode of Law and Order.
4439120	4440120	What about the girl with the whip?
4440120	4441120	Yeah.
4441120	4442120	What about the girl with the whip?
4442120	4443120	Oh my God.
4443120	4446120	Doesn't she make you miss things?
4446120	4448120	I like that girl.
4448120	4451120	I saw art stuff of her, and she was fucking hot.
4451120	4453120	Was that on like DeviantArt?
4453120	4454120	No.
4454120	4455120	Oh.
4455120	4457120	No, you do not go there for concept art.
4457120	4459120	You go there for porn, Rob.
4459120	4463120	Oh, what's the difference between a lawyer and a catfish?
4463120	4464120	What?
4464120	4467120	One's a scum-sucking bottom-feeder, and the other's a fish.
4467120	4470120	Very nice, very nice.
4470120	4472120	One quick thing, Rob.
4472120	4474120	Yeah, what else?
4474120	4478120	All games are interactive, so I love to them.
4478120	4481120	I was defending the Wii, and, well, I failed.
4481120	4482120	How did you fail?
4482120	4483120	I haven't heard this.
4483120	4488120	I love all games, but they almost produce too much show that I can't stay on top of
4488120	4491120	it a lot, so you have to kind of tell me.
4491120	4493120	What were they saying real quick?
4493120	4494120	All right.
4494120	4499120	It was a courtroom battle against the PlayStation 3, the Wii, and the Xbox 360.
4499120	4504120	Of course, the 360 is fun because you've got a bunch of hardcore gamers in there.
4504120	4505120	I love everyone.
4505120	4509120	They're saying that, you know, if you put up a bunch of hardcore gamers, they're going
4509120	4515120	to pay for 360 because it's the best, and that's all I have to say.
4515120	4521120	I defend the Wii, and they ask me why does the graphics suck, and I go, they don't suck.
4521120	4524120	It's because it's based off of GameCube architecture.
4524120	4529120	Then I defended and said the GameCube architecture is actually pretty strong.
4529120	4531120	Just look at Resident Evil 4.
4531120	4532120	I know.
4532120	4535120	It's not like the graphics are bad.
4535120	4540120	It's gameplay versus graphics, and that's not to say that the Xbox has crappy gameplay.
4540120	4543120	It's just that the Wii does something a little different.
4543120	4544120	They're different.
4544120	4547120	It's so hard to compare the two, but I don't know.
4547120	4548120	That's just my thought because I love them both.
4548120	4550120	I'm totally a Wii 60 person.
4550120	4551120	I totally am.
4551120	4552120	That's me.
4552120	4553120	I'm not sold on Sony.
4553120	4555120	I'm not sold on Sony yet.
4555120	4557120	At least this generation.
4557120	4559120	Last generation, I was told.
4559120	4560120	Okay.
4560120	4561120	All right.
4561120	4562120	Okay.
4562120	4563120	That's it.
4563120	4564120	Yeah.
4564120	4565120	We better go.
4565120	4567120	Take care of Raven's Dolphin, though.
4567120	4569120	Have a nice one, and we appreciate you calling.
4569120	4570120	Okay.
4570120	4571120	You too.
4571120	4572120	Bye.
4572120	4573120	Bye-bye.
4573120	4575120	Well, I know a lot of people have been trying to get through tonight, and I apologize.
4575120	4579120	We're not going to be able to take everyone's calls.
4579120	4582120	We've run a little long in both segments, if you can't tell, so we've got to wrap it
4582120	4583120	up.
4583120	4585120	Any last minute stories here in studio?
4585120	4586120	Yes, actually.
4586120	4587120	Okay.
4587120	4588120	What's up?
4588120	4594800	Just for anyone who is a fan of Darwinia, Plink, or DEFCON, introversion is actually
4594800	4597120	stating that they're planning on putting out console games.
4597120	4603420	They haven't really said much yet, but there is a little bit of speculation that Subversion
4603420	4607120	might be heading that way, which is a game they're currently developing.
4607120	4609120	All right.
4609120	4614000	Anyways, there's a rumor going on saying that the next channel possibly for the Wii would
4614000	4617120	be the Nintendo Power Channel.
4617120	4619120	I heard about this.
4619120	4620120	That's interesting.
4620120	4621120	I don't know.
4621120	4626120	I wouldn't buy Nintendo Power, so I guess this would be the only way I'd see it.
4626120	4627120	Anywho...
4627120	4630120	It better have Howard and Esther.
4630120	4635600	There's also another rumor saying that a PS3 will be released to compete with the Xbox
4635600	4637880	360 Core unit.
4637880	4647400	It too will not feature a hard drive as well, and possibly lower the price down to $250.
4647400	4652960	I guess that's kind of cool, because, I mean, you can probably find a laptop hard drive
4652960	4657120	for pretty cheap, but whatever.
4657120	4660020	Also, Final Furlong is coming to the Wii.
4660020	4664320	For those who may not know Final Furlong, Final Furlong is a horse racing game that
4664320	4667920	was in the arcade, and when you play it, it makes it look like you're fucking a horse.
4667920	4668920	That game was great.
4668920	4674360	Hence, we used to call it the horse sex game, so in this, I guess it would be...
4674360	4675360	Hunt the horse.
4675360	4677560	You know, it's bringing the horse sex home.
4677560	4680880	So does this say the cowboy ride a horse?
4680880	4688440	Also in another Grand Theft Auto negative story, apparently Richard O. Jones, a writer
4688440	4695060	for Black Voice News, wrote concerns about racial stereotypes in video games.
4695060	4700680	One such video game he's kind of mad at is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, in which Jones
4700680	4706680	relates to the player who assumes the lead character of Carl Johnson, a down-on-his-luck
4706680	4711100	black criminal who roams the city streets stealing cars and helping gang members knock
4711100	4713400	off rivals in drive-by shootings.
4713400	4718640	Okay, but apparently he didn't play the other games where he played other ethnicities doing
4718640	4722560	the same damn thing.
4722560	4724560	We all hate equally.
4724560	4725560	Besides...
4725560	4730800	Yeah, I hate nose-no-color boundaries.
4730800	4732480	Everybody hates.
4732480	4734960	That should be the next Wii channel.
4734960	4739040	Not everybody votes, everybody poops, everybody hates.
4739040	4740360	Just a big bitch board.
4740360	4742080	What do you hate right now?
4742080	4743080	I hate OLR.
4743080	4746640	What do you hate more than anything at this very moment, Rob?
4746640	4747640	This show.
4747640	4748640	Chris?
4748640	4749640	I'm just kidding.
4749640	4750640	I love this show.
4750640	4756320	I want to see a Wii webcam channel where you can go visit other people's webcams.
4756320	4758840	The Wii Porn Channel.
4758840	4760840	For people who have Wiis.
4760840	4761840	Wii Wiis.
4761840	4762840	PornTube!
4762840	4769440	Yeah, that's what I hate more than anything right now is the fact that Pornotube upgraded
4769440	4774520	their flash player so I can no longer use it on my Wii.
4774520	4777520	Sad, huh?
4777520	4779440	Anything else from anyone?
4779440	4780440	I guess that's it.
4780440	4784600	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts if we can.
4784600	4787880	First off, before we wrap up the show, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning
4787880	4790500	into and supporting Independent Podcast Radio.

4799560	4803720	Live 365 ads, we can't control that because they pay the royalty fees so that's a small
4803720	4805640	concession but it's the site itself.
4805640	4806640	No ads.
4806640	4807640	Podcast itself.
4807640	4811440	No ads as it stands right now and no plans in the foreseeable future, although someday
4811440	4812600	we may have to make money.
4812600	4815360	We do this show at the fitness of our hearts.
4815360	4818840	All we ask, tell one person about Orange Launch Radio.
4818840	4822820	Even if it's your least favorite person in the world, tell them about Orange Launch Radio
4822820	4827160	so that maybe they'll check it out because that's the only way we can promote because
4827160	4834020	we don't have the marketing muscle of magazines and television channels and all that stuff.
4834020	4841960	All we have is us and you guys, the O.L. Army, even Marisa Zech.
4841960	4844720	Tell somebody about Orange Launch Radio and that's all we ask.
4844720	4846480	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4846480	4847480	Chris.
4847480	4848480	We're already doing that.
4848480	4849640	Thank you so much for being here tonight.
4849640	4850640	Appreciate it.
4850640	4852000	What's your final thought?
4852000	4856480	My final thought is actually a plea out to all your listeners and the chatters and you
4856480	4857480	guys.
4857480	4858480	Please.
4858480	4859480	I know.
4859480	4860480	I know.
4860480	4865200	Everyone gets tired of me talking about Megzi, but she is so stressed right now.
4865200	4866360	School full time.
4866360	4867360	She's going to work.
4867360	4872240	They're cracking down on her for crap and she's dealing with Asa and dealing with that
4872240	4873240	kind of stuff.
4873240	4874240	She is so stressed.
4874240	4879480	Can you guys send her some good thoughts or some comments on MySpace or something?
4879480	4882360	You can go to Jamie's MySpace and find her.
4882360	4885180	Although, to be perfectly honest, I would give anything to trade situations with her
4885180	4886180	right now.
4886180	4891720	Yeah, but at the same time, she's stressed and it's like she's not having a happy time
4891720	4892720	right now.
4892720	4897200	If she could, she'd drop everything that she's doing and come out here to be less stressed,
4897200	4898200	but she's not.
4898200	4901880	She's sticking through school, which was a really hard decision for her and stuff.
4901880	4906980	So if people can send out some good thoughts towards her, go to her MySpace or something,
4906980	4913160	give her a comment or something and make her happy just to ease some of it because I think
4913160	4918120	she needs it because I love her and she needs happy.
4918120	4923480	Gaming Nerd says, God, why don't we all trade MySpaces so we can stalk one another?
4923480	4925700	Orange Lawns Radio has a MySpace and you can add us.
4925700	4928320	It's MySpace.com slash Orange Lawns Radio.
4928320	4929320	We're not hard to find.
4929320	4931320	But if you suck, I'm not adding you.
4931320	4932320	All right.
4932320	4934480	Thank you and of course, you know I love Megzi.
4934480	4936480	Speaking of you suck.
4936480	4940520	Congratulations on your first full OLR episode.
4940520	4941520	You know what?
4941520	4944400	Based on your comments you've been making, you're much more of a gamer than you lead
4944400	4945400	on.
4945400	4948200	You follow this stuff more than you'd admit.
4948200	4951720	You know more about gaming than I think you want to admit, but thanks for coming and for
4951720	4952720	your insight.
4952720	4953720	What's your final thought?
4953720	4954720	Oh, yay.
4954720	4955720	This is so much fun.
4955720	4956720	Thank you.
4956720	4957720	Thank you.
4957720	4960240	Thank you so much for putting up with my ass.
4960240	4964220	And my last... Oh, yay, hugs to Megzi.
4964220	4967640	My final thought would be people add me on MySpace.
4967640	4968640	I hate MySpace.
4968640	4969640	I do.
4969640	4972320	To be perfectly honest with those that don't like it, but it's unfortunately a necessary
4972320	4973320	evil.
4973320	4974320	It is.
4974320	4975320	It really is.
4975320	4976320	I say the same thing.
4976320	4977320	It's where the internet goes to die.
4977320	4978320	It's true.
4978320	4979320	I don't have a 4chan.
4979320	4980320	But you get accepted in that too.
4980320	4985320	It's like cake or death, 4chan on MySpace.
4985320	4986480	My final thought is yay.
4986480	4988200	Thank you to everybody, especially fans.
4988200	4991480	Even if you're just fans for my boobies, that's fine too.
4991480	4994600	It's radio though, so it's hard.
4994600	4995600	They are really big.
4995600	5005240	If you like me or if you want to see my boobies, well, not naked, myspace.com slash M-A-R-I-S-S-A
5005240	5014440	M-E-I-Z-E-L or if you don't like MySpace and it's MySpace bad just like sunlight, M-A-R-I-S-S-A
5014440	5018120	C-O-N-G-U-S-T-O at gmail.com.
5018120	5019120	Email me.
5019120	5020120	Whatever.
5020120	5021120	Cool.
5021120	5022120	Thank you.
5022120	5023120	No problem.
5023120	5026240	We'll have to play some folk rock on a later episode of Orange Lounge.
5026240	5027240	Oh, I get so many good friends.
5027240	5028240	Give the listeners some culture.
5028240	5029240	I've played James Hurley on my show before.
5029240	5030240	James Hurley is awesome.
5030240	5031240	He is.
5031240	5033240	And James Lee Stanley is my favorite.
5033240	5035040	He has the best sideburns ever.
5035040	5036040	He does.
5036040	5037040	He has pointy sideburns.
5037040	5038040	You need to play Marissa's song on the next pop up of the volume.
5038040	5039440	If Marissa would give me some.
5039440	5040440	Oh, yay.
5040440	5043400	And just to promote a friend, James Lee Stanley is an awesome musician who put a picture of
5043400	5046400	me in a Jessica Rabbit outfit on his album.
5046400	5050040	She's got that on her MySpace too.
5050040	5052120	Anyway, I'm sorry.
5052120	5053120	Thank you guys so much.
5053120	5054120	It was a blast.
5054120	5055120	No problem.
5055120	5056120	Thank you for coming.
5056120	5057120	Ease up on the guitar hero hate.
5057120	5058120	All right.
5058120	5060120	Loki, your final thought.
5060120	5061480	I got to play more Crackdown.
5061480	5064000	Two of the three gangs done.
5064000	5065200	One last one left.
5065200	5068600	The Asians are always the hardest to kill.
5068600	5071640	I don't even know how to take that comment or what kind of hate mail we're going to get
5071640	5073280	from that.
5073280	5075400	Rice Princess, do you have a final thought?
5075400	5077920	I like British guys.
5077920	5084520	The British guy is cute, but he's kind of young for me because I'm an old lady with
5084520	5085520	a crutch.
5085520	5086520	I mean, a crutch.
5086520	5087520	A cane.
5087520	5088520	A crutch.
5088520	5089520	I'm an old lady with a crutch.
5089520	5095760	Yeah, but you're still cute and you have a great voice, so bye.
5095760	5097160	So cute.
5097160	5102160	I guess I'll go next, so we'll save the best for last, won't we, DarkSaga?
5102160	5103640	As always, huh?
5103640	5109600	My final thought is Kirby.
5109600	5111040	Kirby is my final thought.
5111040	5112040	DarkSaga.
5112040	5117040	If Meg Z is listening by any chance, you fully have my sympathy because I am right now working
5117040	5120840	full time, going to school 12 hours a week.
5120840	5125440	Actually this week I'm taking two extra classes and have to do 10 documented massages by the
5125440	5126440	end of the year.
5126440	5129160	I'm sorry, by the end of March.
5129160	5133280	And then have to take more classes and then find a way to quit my job.
5133280	5135800	So I totally feel your pain.
5135800	5137680	I am suffering with you.
5137680	5139960	Meg Z!
5139960	5142880	Okay, bye.
5142880	5143880	All right.
5143880	5146520	That concludes another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
5146520	5151760	Thank you guys so much for supporting independent radio and next week we'll talk about video
5151760	5153400	games at some point.
5153400	5155400	We promise.
