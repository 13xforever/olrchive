487	19088	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
20188	24791	Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for Part B of our podcast.
24831	34116	If this is the first time you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, remember that we do broadcast in two parts because we tape live on Sunday nights for about three hours, or as tonight's going, maybe about four hours.
34737	46564	And there's some bonus stuff that you can only hear when you listen to us live or when you listen to us on our rebroadcast over at allgames.com, which is Mondays at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time and Tuesdays at 9 a.m.
46604	48825	We like all games because it's this big...
49369	49749	and many more.
75060	78722	More rare games are going to make their way, I guess, to the DS.
78902	93090	Well, probably not the case, but according to Microsoft's VP, Shane Kim, he spoke to 1UP and basically told them a cameo or Viva Pinata on DS makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways from a franchise perspective.
93411	99234	I think it's fair to say we're going to continue to invest in Viva Pinata, but you probably won't see it on the PSP.
101809	106652	I would say you probably won't see it on the DS either because that's still a competing system with them, I mean.
107373	108554	That seems so weird to me.
108874	112276	So you're basically saying people are assuming because of the fact he said that.
112596	112896	Yeah.
113537	127626	I mean, and this just further lends that thing that Microsoft is secretly in bed with Nintendo, but they are so the bottom because Reggie just keeps, you know, regulating on Microsoft that, you know, no, we don't want to form a partnership with Microsoft.
127646	130048	We'd rather you buy more of our games and more of our components.
130552	140020	So Microsoft is totally being a submissive bottom in this relationship because now they're talking about, oh, but Nintendo, I'll totally put Viva Pinata inside you.
144143	145404	I don't know.
145444	149148	Is it just me?
150509	155593	It would work, but first off, Viva Pinata, the graphics wouldn't look right.
155653	156854	I mean, it's just another kind of,
157964	161145	Not really a Pokemon type of game, but it's your breeding stuff.
162245	162625	I don't know.
164286	168647	SSJ100Matt says, maybe Microsoft should give Nintendo advice on internet play.
169027	169387	You win.
169747	171808	Yeah, seriously.
173788	175489	Bandit says, hey Rare.
176189	177449	Yes, I'm talking with my mouth full.
177649	178150	I can do that.
178630	179850	It's partly my show too.
180550	183051	Bandit says, hey Rare, give me Killer Instinct already.
185202	186363	I say that with a mouthful of donut.
186683	189925	Fuck that, you get Banjo-Kazooie.
189945	190005	Eww.
191987	192907	Kazooie wasn't that bad.
192927	193388	I guess it was.
194609	199612	Mike W. says, Major Nelson, Major Nelson, Major Nelson Hearts Nintendo.
200573	201293	So does Trixie.
201674	203675	I remember reading on one of Trixie's blogs on Xbox.
203695	205476	I have no idea why I was reading Trixie's blog.
205516	207318	I was bored on the internet and that's where I found myself.
208178	212261	But, because whenever I hear Trixie, I think of the stripper in the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but never mind.
212761	214863	So I'm like, do you perform with the cast?
215165	220691	Anyway, but Trixie, she wrote her Christmas list, and one of the things on the Christmas list was a Wii.
221371	223654	Then I was like, aren't you guys supposed to be competitors?
224074	229720	So Microsoft, again, being the submissive big old bottom.
230221	231362	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
232803	233304	That's your thing.
233922	238764	Can I say personally, though, that I'm actually really impressed at how the Xbox 360 just took off.
238804	241925	I mean, again, I'm more of a spectator because of the money.
242445	249168	But, I mean, at the very beginning, having an Xbox was just, oh, you know, you have a console that freezes.
249828	258231	And everybody's giving crap to all my friends who initially went out and bought an Xbox, and the 360 seems to be kicking some serious ass.
258811	263373	So, I mean, that seems to be exciting, and it's actually something that I enjoyed as well when I started to play it.
263777	264818	I love Spamusement.
264838	269600	So the spam email subject line was, are you man enough for this?
293456	297019	And what it was, is it was an Xbox with a deep fryer attachment.
299261	302483	And that was the problem with the original Xbox, is it was too butch.
304024	306847	But the Xbox 360... And the controller was just too fucking big!
306927	314633	The Xbox 360, you know, it's still butch, you know, it's not gay, but it's a little fruity.
314973	315573	And that's okay.
316434	317815	It's got like Viva Pinata.
317835	319617	No, you go first.
320529	323334	I was this close, actually, to getting my boyfriend the Xbox 360.
323635	324536	I'm too good.
324576	326359	I got my ex a PSP for Christmas.
326740	332650	I was this close to actually getting my boyfriend a 360, because that's what he loves, because he loves the Xbox for Christmas, but...
333413	335655	JV Mon sums it up perfectly.
335775	336656	The 360 is metrosexual.
357413	368244	Not to, I hate going back to the, well no I don't, but not to go too much back to the gay issue, but I get a magazine called The Advocate, which is basically a gay and lesbian magazine specifically.
368264	369586	Is that GLAAD's agenda?
370860	375523	I am a gay gamer, I'm not the biggest fan of GLAAD, because sometimes they get their panties ruffled too easy.
375783	392032	I don't know who it was, but they were talking about how video games are starting to bring more of that in, and they were talking, like Bully was one of them, Sims 2, but they talked about Gears of War, like the two main characters, like no one can convince me that those two characters are not boning each other.
392372	399616	Well, look, one of the achievements is called I Wish I Knew How to Quit You, or like Dom Curious, I don't remember what it was called, something like that.
399936	402660	Oh no, I thought it was like, I can't quit you, Dom, or something like that.
402700	404462	It's one of the achievements in Gears of War.
405423	406744	There's subtleties there.
407285	408487	Meg's giving me huge shit about it.
408567	410028	It's like, they are not!
410389	411470	It's nothing major.
412091	413432	It's just an LOL moment.
413512	415835	It's not trying to make a statement or anything.
415895	416296	Like, oh...
416556	419698	Cliffy B is like secretly a gay supporter.
420199	421039	Maybe he is.
421620	422180	Who cares?
422240	422981	It's a video game.
423281	424322	Who cares?
424822	427925	I can't tear away my boyfriend from Gears of War at Best Buy.
427945	428865	Does that make him kind of gay?
428885	430366	You've contaminated your microphone with gay.
430667	434509	Because I'll totally go for the guy that said he'd marry me for liking that adventure game.
434910	437031	I got gay from Rob a long time ago with the Pepsi bong.
437592	438152	All right, anyhow.
438572	439113	At Golfland.
441455	445878	And I'm being asked by several people, please tell me you aren't a crab person.
447012	448633	No, well, both of us, because we're both gay.
449113	452214	Did you ever see that episode of South Park with the crab people?
452534	453315	Queer Eye?
453995	454415	Never mind.
455616	457056	Do we ever talk video games on this show?
457116	463078	Yes, we do once in a while, and this is a very interesting sort of game that's coming to the DS.
463979	468681	There's a new brand of toys in Japan called Treasure Gaust, and it's going to be coming to the DS.
468701	469161	Well, get this.
469481	474783	You remember how, like, Boktai used sunlight, and there was another game in Japan that used barcodes?
475253	476874	Take your DS to a power plant.
501024	501864	Take it to a power plant.
502024	505466	Or get a blacklight in your house because that thing will send that thing off the rockets.
506306	509487	I wonder if a fridge magnet will fuck with this game.
509507	510788	Do they have those stones that make noise?
512008	512648	So there you go.
513049	514609	Treasure Gauss coming to the DS.
514849	517190	Boy, the DS now really does everything.
517210	521092	Well, that's kind of cool, though, because it's like degaussing your monitor.
521192	522152	It's certainly something new.
522812	525053	Well, here is something new, but not really.
525133	526954	We get more Harvest Moon.
528575	529695	Duh, award of the week.
530856	559393	Harvest Moon DS will be out on the 13th of April I know at least in the UK I'm not sure if that's also applying to the US because I got my information off of UK stuff however it's more cows and more sheep and you get tutorials on how to raise your animals and plant seeds and crops and make money on your farm fall asleep while playing a video game
560251	563454	and have sex with Harvest Sprites and the Witch Princess.
563594	563994	I'm awake.
565335	565655	No, really.
566276	568117	And then you can actually get married in the game.
568858	571580	You have 25 villagers and you can go fishing.
572060	574982	All they'll do is just nag you to fucking tend to the animals.
578485	580566	You can probably, you know, hump the sheep or something.
582228	585310	All they do is stay at home and watch Oprah while you're out milking the cow.
585350	586671	I have a Harvest Moon sheep.
587592	587872	I do.
587892	587972	I do.
589335	590776	He sleeps by my bed with Stitch.
592017	593758	Gaming Nerd says, I'm buying this game.
593818	594199	Whee!
595560	596020	There you go.
597041	601925	Anyways, um, so... John Dorian says, I think Harvest Moon for the DS already came out.
602045	603866	I think... I don't know if this is a new one.
604166	604947	I think this is a new one.
605267	605527	Wow.
606989	611312	I mean, there's a new Harvest Moon game every year on every platform, so, you know, it's the same fucking thing every time.
611352	613994	I'm sorry, I'm not a big Harvest Moon fan, if you can't already tell.
614714	618057	I find the game to be incredibly boring, yet I love Animal Crossing.
618536	621337	So obviously, my taste in games is fucked.
621377	622057	I admit it, okay?
622097	624038	Evangelicals love Animal Crossing.
624058	625639	Evangelicals love Animal Crossing?
625659	626239	I don't know why.
626259	629801	Why would Evangelicals... You should have seen the shit we were doing in Animal Crossing.
630161	634182	I got one of my animals to always say, you cunt, after everything they said.
635323	636843	Can I have a fish, you cunt?
637284	641045	And then, like, we painted gay pride symbols and put them all over town.
641065	644447	Remember the girl in my village who was their village lesbian?
644647	647948	My Animal Crossing village was an evangelical nightmare.
648522	651645	On my DS one, though, we had our village lesbian, and when she moved out, we cried.
651825	652545	No, I remember that.
652585	652906	I remember that.
652926	654067	Because she moved to Julie's village.
654127	655688	It's because I hit her with a bug net so much.
656709	657669	She moved to Julie's village.
657850	658890	And she was a PE teacher.
658931	659931	She had gym equipment.
659951	660312	That's right.
660332	661252	She had gym equipment in her house.
661272	662413	She was such a lesbian.
663214	665836	And so we made a little rainbow sign to be outside of her house.
665956	667477	Do you know why Animal Crossing is sick?
667537	669759	Because we're talking about these people like they're real.
672141	673883	You know you liked Olivia.
675184	677926	That's the one I think I got to say you cunt after everything.
679957	683739	There's nothing funnier than getting video game characters to say shit and poop.
683759	683819	Yay!
685600	686701	How about Pee Pee Kaka?
687922	688282	Anyway.
688302	689263	I had one that said that.
690323	691584	So, Capcom.
691744	692585	Yeah, they're awesome.
692725	700550	And they used to have a studio called Clover, which put out such games like Okami, Beautiful Joe, fun stuff like that.
700910	704192	Well, of course, you remember Clover went buh-bye.
704670	705050	Dekki Kamiya
735305	736506	And I probably butchered those names.
736746	738326	But it should be interesting.
738727	744890	Hopefully we get some more original games, kind of like... Actually, they worked on... What was it?
745170	745690	Gunhand?
746890	747771	I think that was the name of that.
747951	748811	Godhand, that's what it was.
750092	750612	That was okay.
751252	754194	But yeah, awesome.
754334	755915	More studios making more games.
757956	764779	I have, on another completely different tangent, I have the news that might save PlayStation 3.
765987	766547	And here it is.
766967	779932	There's a rumor going around that there are, because based off reports from Japan, that the head of the Sony Financial Division is suggesting that a PlayStation 3 price cut in 2007 may be on the way.
780992	791876	Now it seems like there's a story about this like every other week, but this one's really been circulating around the different blogs, so we hope there's a little bit of truth to it, but the honest end of it is, if there is a price cut coming, it's probably not until Christmas.
792503	795544	because they'll try to lie to fire under PS3 sales.
795784	799745	They're going to have to because Halo 3 is going to be a big problem.
800546	812010	I would say if they want to be smart, they'll cut the price of the PlayStation 3 the same day as the Halo 3 comes out.
813470	814310	That would be the best thing ever.
814971	815651	We'll see what happens.
817418	825323	Well, as for other things that we're seeing happening, and I really wish we weren't seeing this happen, there's an Aqua Teen Hunger Force game on the PS2.
826284	829146	And this is what you get for drinking beer milkshakes.
830787	831268	Yeah.
832168	833069	It's a golfing game.
833289	833709	I know.
834190	837532	It's just... Extreme combat golf, they call it.
839513	840254	Whose story is this?
842035	843036	Well, I'm just hoping.
843096	843336	Interesting.
843818	844478	Can I say something?
844498	845979	Okay, tell us more about the game, Jamie.
846259	846919	Go right ahead.
847179	848820	Can I say something completely random first?
848880	849040	Yeah.
849080	850221	Jamie likes to do that to my stories.
851041	865207	This has nothing to do with gaming at all, but you know how in Rocky Horror Picture Show at the end, you always have, like, if you ever go see it live in the theater, when Riff Raff and Magenta come back into the, they're sometimes dressed up as famous couples or some type of coupling.
865287	870489	Like, you know, maybe they'll come, like, I remember one time when I actually performed as Riff Raff, we came out as the characters from Brokeback Mountain.
871044	872425	and, you know, just like couples like that.
872685	878428	Well, last night, they came out in these giant cardboard cutouts of Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
878988	880929	And it was the best gold scene I'd ever seen in my life.
880969	882650	Dinner is papayas!
883270	885411	Something like that.
885631	899678	Sorry, that random moment was brought to you by... I was just sort of in shock because I'm like, it's bad enough that it's Aqua Teen Hunger Force, but they have to just completely turn the state in my heart and making it combat golf with sawed-off shotguns.
902297	905318	Midway, stop taking the LSD, please.
906398	907818	You are not a hero.
908719	911099	You cannot tell the future through Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
911739	913059	Lay off the drugs.
913580	914300	Next, please.
915600	917340	I want to read some comments from chat real quick.
918000	921801	Going to, let's see, back to the PlayStation 3 story.
921841	924082	Let's have T says, PlayStation 3 needs a price cut.
924142	926922	That's the only way that it might become a real threat to Microsoft.
927522	929963	SSJ100 Matt says, Aqua Teen Hunger Force game.
930273	932275	The only game that won't be in Boston.
933576	936038	To which WB Bulldogs tags along to that.
936058	937519	The Boston Scare was a bunch of bullshit.
938660	940541	Media blowing things out of proportion.
940702	943864	Got the show a lot of visibility, although I hear it didn't help in the ratings.
943904	944425	That's too bad.
945686	947167	The ratings are doing pretty good as it is.
947267	949629	I mean, yeah, the show is doing fine as it is, so what can you do?
950009	950410	Anyways.
950450	950990	Cool!
951070	952591	Mikotov's going to let me borrow Hotel Dusk.
952611	953292	I've been wanting to play this.
955574	956294	You mean book.
956314	957796	You can't have the game.
957856	959077	He's loaning it to me.
962212	963613	Oh, game list!
983442	984923	You know, every time you...
1012302	1015684	Every time I'm on this frickin' show, you say that, Rob.
1016224	1017585	Every single time.
1018465	1019506	It doesn't mean anything, I swear.
1023828	1025709	Heart... Broken.
1026249	1028610	Oh, okay, I get to read a story now.
1028670	1029110	That's great.
1030051	1034493	Anyways, apparently the team behind Ico is working on a brand new title for the PS3.
1035353	1039776	People are hoping that it's a brand new version of Shadow Colossus or even Ico.
1040416	1040516	Um...
1041198	1046239	Although it's probably going to be something original that looks yet very similar to both those two games.
1046539	1051221	So, no word on what it is, but we know that they're working on something.
1053681	1056262	There's something coming soon.
1056282	1058243	You gotta love gaming news like that.
1062864	1063944	Something is coming.
1064804	1068625	Something is coming to the PlayStation 3 and it's got a big schnauzer.
1069006	1070486	It's Q-Bert, you perverts.
1070799	1074560	Qbert's coming to the PlayStation 3 on February 22nd.
1074600	1076620	Hey, that's this week.
1077041	1080201	$4.99, undercutting the cost of the average Microsoft game by one cent.
1081702	1082542	Good job, Sony.
1083562	1086883	And, of course, Qbert will have the online leaderboards.
1086963	1088503	It's going to be in 720p.
1089203	1095565	And apparently players will be fighting against each other to see who can be the supreme noser.
1096845	1099826	Because that's the number one person on the leaderboard is the supreme noser.
1100692	1101652	I'm sorry.
1102853	1107294	Q-Bert jumped the shark when they had the Q-Bert cartoon, although that was kind of cool.
1107454	1108654	But I do love the Q-Bert game.
1109075	1115737	I do love the fact that Sony can't really say anything about their PlayStation Network right now because there's nothing on it!
1116477	1117017	Nothing!
1117157	1118357	There's nothing on there.
1118377	1121518	There's like six games and a few demos and that's it.
1121838	1126760	To be honest, the fucking Nintendo Network has more stuff on it than the Sony Network does.
1127361	1128422	I mean, come on.
1128522	1129783	Put out some more shit.
1129863	1133626	I don't care if this is stuff that's already been on the 360 or whatever.
1134046	1134787	More games.
1135187	1135688	Seriously.
1136268	1136949	More demos.
1136989	1138950	I mean, ooh, full auto 2 demo.
1139651	1141292	Only months after the game came out.
1141512	1142093	Hooray.
1142553	1142973	And you know what?
1142993	1143734	The game still sucks.
1144394	1146456	And I don't know.
1146476	1147497	They just need more shit.
1148077	1150219	Qbert is not filling the void that they need.
1151880	1153061	More original stuff.
1153221	1154282	And no PSP ports.
1154542	1156384	Stop it with the goddamn PSP ports.
1157853	1164438	Well, why don't we move away from Sony's stinky poop pile of a camp and go to the Nintendo World?
1165059	1166961	Although this is actually pretty poopy, too.
1169282	1174287	Cooking Mama Cook-Off has actually been pushed back.
1174427	1174787	Sorry.
1176168	1176588	In Europe.
1179291	1179931	Sorry, Europe.
1179971	1182013	The original release date was March 29th.
1182493	1183734	Now it's pushed back to May 10th.
1184215	1185656	They are not listing a reason.
1187639	1188840	That's really crappy, isn't it?
1188980	1189840	Don't worry, Europe.
1190221	1191321	Mama will fix it.
1193262	1194103	Had to, sorry.
1195984	1196805	We love you, Europe.
1197745	1198686	Even though we don't like the band.
1203028	1212114	Okay, well, you know, news of Cooking Mama getting delayed, even if it doesn't directly affect us here in the U.S., we feel your angst, our listeners overseas.
1212174	1215616	We feel your angst, and therefore we dedicate this podcast
1216227	1218648	FUs of the week segment to our overseas listeners.
1228353	1230213	DarkSakura, start us off with the angst.
1231374	1233515	Fuck you to accidents.
1234115	1243259	Because I banged my wrist into a big metal pole today and I have this big bruise and now I have this big swollen scald on my hand from your freaking T, Rob.
1243880	1244680	You didn't have to.
1247864	1248784	But it was yummy, thank you.
1249925	1251546	I didn't buy it.
1251626	1252046	Oh, thank you.
1253807	1259670	And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, um, F you to having to pay $800 to buy a massage table.
1261611	1261991	Loki!
1263812	1272896	Um, I don't really have anything other than, I guess, um, F you to people that can't, you know, abide by street dates.
1272916	1276478	You know, I know that's a bit, you know, hypocritical, but yeah.
1277586	1287411	It's an exception, because you see, the rules state that you cannot sell it, rent it, or make it available to the public in that form.
1287891	1289172	Playing it is not on there.
1289652	1293153	Playing it is okie-dokie, so that's all I did is play it.
1293194	1296575	I didn't sell it or rent it, so I'm off scuffery.
1296955	1302878	But anyways, other people though, even people that should know better, like some of the comp USA's and EB games out there,
1303716	1306878	There's a big fucking sticker on it that says do not sell before 2.20.
1306938	1308599	Don't be a dumb fuck.
1308860	1311842	I mean, you're not getting paid that much money to do your job.
1312222	1316625	And I mean, honestly, no one gives a shit if you have the game, you know, days before everybody else.
1317145	1319727	Everyone's going to forget it, you know, down the line anyway.
1319747	1321708	So, who gives a crap?
1322549	1325010	But I need more people to buy this game so I can play with them online.
1325050	1326832	Because it's going to be fun.
1328007	1330188	I'm thinking about it, but $60 is a lot to spend.
1330208	1331769	I mean, look how much I played Gears of War.
1331969	1333250	It's fun.
1333390	1334070	It really is fun.
1334150	1334770	I'll think about it.
1335551	1336972	You've got to bring your copy over second place.
1336992	1338913	All right.
1339213	1342574	My view of the week goes to my voice, because I'm losing it again, and that sucks.
1342594	1350538	Because, you know, for those who say I talk too much on this show, do realize I'm used to talking all day and getting paid for it for a living in the teaching world.
1351199	1355401	So, yeah, losing my voice and having to go to my day job tomorrow is going to kind of suck.
1356061	1357622	Luckily, I could just give my class a test.
1358263	1358883	I'm off, Rob.
1360004	1360845	Well, you suck.
1361465	1363827	I'll be at home enjoying my day off for you.
1364628	1364948	Good.
1365168	1366549	You have fun with that, bitch.
1366869	1367169	All right.
1367810	1368590	I mean, I love you.
1369391	1371232	Where's that?
1371332	1372853	Your inaugural FUs of the week.
1372873	1373574	What do you want to angst on?
1373594	1375816	Oh, yeah, I get to break my FU of the week theory.
1376356	1381300	It's funny because, as my friends like to say after work, I love to get my hate on.
1381800	1385943	But I'm having such a good time being up here up north of NorCal Rules.
1386910	1389311	and SoCal's Rules, even though I'm an LA native.
1390072	1393973	But my fuck you of the week is so funny because I hate, I hate, I love to get my hate on.
1394834	1396754	Let it all out, baby, let it all out.
1396794	1397455	Let it all out.
1397475	1398755	I'm like, seriously, what can I say?
1399776	1406398	I guess my F you of the week, you go to my ex-boyfriend, not because I'm bitter, okay, I am a little bit, but because he has every reason.
1406999	1407379	Which one?
1408587	1409507	Oh, not him.
1409587	1412448	Oh, because I was going to say that one you have never seen.
1412528	1412888	Oh, F.U.
1412948	1415869	of the week to him, too, but David, a.k.a.
1416009	1420871	S.Kalian, big gamer nerd, and he likes to make anime music videos.
1420891	1421611	Uh-oh.
1421631	1422772	What if he listens to the show?
1423332	1424252	He probably does.
1424272	1425512	That's why I'm doing it.
1426853	1427233	Oh, boy.
1427273	1432575	And instead of going out, which is okay, because I would pay for everything anyway, and I got on the PSP, because you know why?
1432595	1434795	Because I'm the best ex-girlfriend ever.
1435476	1436396	But we used to play...
1437100	1439002	And last but not least, some lesbian FUs from Chris.
1467224	1469505	I have two quick ones.
1469565	1470945	I won't be too long.
1471206	1477649	One, F you to the Scientology Center for fucking roping my father into it.
1478009	1479009	Leave my father alone.
1479230	1481171	He's old, he's bitter, and he has money.
1481931	1482671	Knock the fuck off.
1482691	1484392	I'm so sick of it.
1485032	1487133	And F you to the week to me.
1487874	1490435	Because... You're awesome.
1491336	1495798	Yeah, but... I don't... I wish I could do more...
1497233	1501763	I know I rant about something every week around here with Meg D, but she lives in Wisconsin.
1502245	1504009	She goes to school full time.
1504659	1509243	She's at work part-time and she's got ASUN coming up where she's being in costume and stuff like that.
1509303	1511304	And she's just so stressed out.
1511445	1515588	And I F you to me for not being able to do something to help her more.
1515808	1517249	You know what?
1517309	1520492	She's obviously got a gal who loves her very much.
1520832	1523114	And a lot of people in this world are not that lucky.
1523214	1525416	So that's what you can give.
1525796	1527698	I just wish I could do more for her.
1528746	1529667	Thanks for watching!
1548979	1549239	Wow.
1549700	1551041	She'll enjoy that.
1551081	1555044	Somehow we went from I love my girlfriend so much to fuck you, Maisie.
1555204	1556646	Fuck you right in your ear hole.
1558287	1559108	She knows I love her.
1559148	1560829	I bought her a pink leather collar.
1561330	1563031	I love Maisie, too.
1563111	1563592	She's great.
1564312	1564753	I'm sorry.
1564913	1568396	I have one last fuck you of the week, and that's to Gears of War for hypnotizing my boyfriend.
1569376	1571158	He never wants to leave the fucking best buy.
1571758	1573720	Oh, Gears of War.
1574181	1574541	So, yeah.
1575883	1576323	Anyone else?
1576363	1577104	I need a new boyfriend.
1577124	1577744	Any volunteers?
1577984	1579005	It's a popular game.
1580806	1586231	Well, I don't swing that way, but I'll pose in pictures and stuff so you can tell your family.
1586271	1588412	What, at Disneyland?
1588433	1588513	Yeah.
1590240	1592921	I love you to death, but you're gay and you act it!
1592942	1593262	I am not gay!
1593282	1595103	What are you talking about?
1595143	1597124	How can anyone mistake you for her husband?
1597184	1597364	Sorry.
1597384	1598845	Alright, I'm done.
1620356	1621257	Back to gaming news.
1621277	1622977	Because they couldn't hear him talk in the picture.
1628360	1632743	In fact, on my MySpace, Chris left me a comment where I'm holding the gay lightsaber from Disneyland.
1633243	1634624	I had it in my big one.
1635004	1636945	It says, use the gay force, Rob.
1637025	1640367	Oh, I need to add that to my pictures now that I have 300 pictures, so I'm going to do that.
1641007	1641508	Alright, sorry.
1641828	1642308	Gaming news.
1642528	1643689	Anybody, somebody, help.
1643829	1645009	Anyways, so...
1646505	1652046	Out of all the retarded shit that come out for gamers, this has to be up there with some of them.
1653287	1655147	Headshot, the energy bar.
1655607	1667870	Yes, you too can buy a fucking energy bar called Headshot and be uber cool because you eat fucking energy bars that have to do with gaming while you're gaming.
1668310	1669491	Ooh, you're fucking awesome.
1670631	1674712	And, you know, while you're at it, I want you to wash that Headshot down with some balls.
1676436	1678857	Ooh, that sounds like fun!
1681017	1684077	Come on, Jamie, I know I'm your husband, but can I drink some balls?
1684097	1689238	I'm going to get hate mail from GLAAD, even though I'm gay.
1689318	1690159	Isn't that ironic?
1690939	1692319	We should tell Mr. Spanky about that.
1694019	1694679	Alright, anyhow.
1696040	1696860	Yeah, headshot.
1696920	1698640	Wow, that's something else.
1699240	1700800	Oh, and that was the other thing.
1700820	1702121	I believe...
1705051	1709855	It was this website, UncommonLoot.com, that was running the story about that.
1711616	1712977	It looks so awful.
1712997	1714979	It probably tastes like ass, too.
1716059	1717541	Some people like the taste of ass.
1721123	1722044	You like ass?
1722064	1723505	Well, we have the drink for you.
1723565	1727989	Wasn't there a drink on English.com or something that was A-S-S-E or something?
1729009	1730090	It was a type of candy.
1730911	1732632	Pocari Sweat's actually really good.
1733713	1734434	Wait, what was I going to say?
1734714	1734794	Um...
1736316	1740719	Oh, Rob D in chat said, if Rob and Jamie were married, one of them would be dead by now.
1742461	1742981	So true.
1743021	1743662	That would be Rob.
1743782	1744362	So true.
1744702	1745203	Well, really?
1746664	1746924	All right.
1747925	1761474	Anyhow, let's get into some PC gaming news, because I know it's been a pretty interesting show tonight with some very random stuff, but there's nothing more hardcore than PC gaming, because seriously, PC gamer fans are like, they're like, fuming at the mouth hardcore.
1761794	1762815	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
1763622	1765663	Mist Online went live this week.
1765723	1768204	This is a game a lot of folks have been like, ooh, even Marissa's casting it.
1768684	1769705	No, Mist is not dead.
1770745	1774486	Through the service GameTap, you can play Mist Online.
1774847	1778108	It's $9.95 a month for GameTap, and you get access to like hundreds of games, not just this.
1779128	1781149	And it launched on February 15th.
1781969	1790693	Now, right now, it's only available to GameTap subscribers, but apparently they're going to make the game available as like a direct download in other countries.
1791309	1791729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1819685	1820866	No, I actually really want to check this out.
1821087	1826052	I'm going to really try to play this and review it for next week's show because I keep saying, oh, I've got to play Salmon Max.
1826092	1827574	I really need to spend some quality time with GameTap.
1827594	1828675	Salmon Max, yay!
1828695	1831478	But I keep going back to WoW because it's crack.
1832239	1833260	Salmon Max, yay!
1834481	1835182	War crack.
1835202	1835502	Sorry.
1835742	1836163	Anyway.
1836920	1840083	Well, just a little bit of information.
1840403	1845547	For fans of Gears of War who have a PC, it's eventually going to be on the PC.
1846108	1854154	It was actually confirmed by Epic's VP, Mark Raine, said that it's not just a rumor, it's going to happen, just not soon.
1854795	1855876	He just said it's inevitable.
1857297	1858738	I guess it's not a really big surprise.
1858838	1861120	I mean, you know, it's one of Microsoft's biggest, if they want
1861604	1864365	More people to come over to the PC bandwagon.
1864405	1866665	Why not put something out for those that don't have the 360?
1867105	1869185	Gears of War is a huge title.
1869505	1870366	Makes perfect sense.
1870686	1872786	I don't know why it took them this long to simply acknowledge it.
1873706	1880427	Anyways, so there's going to be a brand new action-oriented role-playing game coming out to the PC.
1880967	1886789	Silverfall by Atari and Monte Cristo Games is finally gone gold.
1886969	1888849	It's scheduled to be released on March 20th.
1890229	1891630	and will retail for $39.95.
1891871	1897596	It actually looks pretty cool, kind of a little fantasy mixed with technology type of role-playing game.
1897616	1899437	I guess it's kind of like a Final Fantasy.
1899697	1905082	Plus, the cover has boobs on it, so you gotta buy it because of the boobies.
1906003	1907484	What do you think, Jamie?
1908445	1908785	Let me see.
1914250	1914670	Not bad.
1914710	1915691	She probably has back problems.
1920299	1921600	Glory's, Glory's, Boobs!
1944366	1944986	So there you have it.
1945306	1947948	So where the Wii does not have a camera, now you're going to get this on the Xbox 360.
1947988	1949108	That's going to be interesting.
1949128	1950969	It's going to work fantastic.
1951389	1951869	Yeah, I know.
1951929	1954130	Those camera games are not that great.
1954270	1955591	Just like the eye toy.
1956351	1964995	But Rayman's Raving Rabbids doesn't exactly have a lot of, like, I would think in translating some of those games, there's not a lot of motion-intensive stuff in that game.
1965015	1966156	You know what I mean?
1967536	1969397	Like, I can't imagine there would be that much motion.
1970916	1973518	There's a lot of motion going on in that game.
1973718	1974179	Never mind.
1975540	1975860	Forget it.
1976020	1976761	Just don't buy it.
1977561	1979623	It's a horrible game.
1980083	1980764	Alright, I'll do that.
1981064	1983326	I'll do that.
1983366	1983826	Let's see.
1984507	1988950	Let's go on to DarkSakura's website of the week.
1988990	1991152	I was trying to see if there was good chat comments.
1991252	1992133	Sorry if I sounded sidetracked.
1992153	1993434	No, they're talking about breasts.
1993474	1994414	They're all talking about boobs.
1996096	1999658	Although, I do have to say, holy shit, it's boobs get in the car from GS68.
2001090	2003071	My rebuttal to that was going to the Boobs BRB.
2004392	2013337	All right, well, I also want to hear your rebuttal to the website of the week, because every week DarkSakura surfs the website up and down and left and right to find her favorite website.
2013898	2016059	I don't know if it will be Doctor Who related this week.
2016099	2017120	We will soon find out.
2017200	2017640	Here we go.
2017920	2020201	Yes, she does surf the website up and down.
2020882	2023844	I say the web... Shut up.
2023864	2026465	The website of the week is the Orange Ons Radio Forums.
2026705	2027446	No.
2027746	2027826	Um...
2028624	2030006	You know, Rob, stop the music.
2030506	2033329	Stop the music.
2033349	2036353	The website of the week is very personal to me.
2037294	2038035	Very important.
2039136	2044742	You know, I think that we're forgetting the presence of greatness in our lives.
2045483	2048947	We should all bow down and pay homage to our Lord and Master.
2050000	2073819	The Flying Spaghetti Monster Oh my god, yes So the site dedicated to our noodley lord master I am a pastafari and I must confess Blessed be his noodley goodness, ramen The site is What the fuck happened to this show?
2075180	2077802	Seriously, what fucking show am I on?
2078383	2079584	In the name of the noodle
2080643	2082664	I love carbohydrates.
2082684	2084145	Carbohydrates are so good.
2084525	2093471	The site is www.venganza.org for a little bit of history.
2095332	2104177	The great one was discovered through a series of detections along the same lines as intelligent design.
2105218	2109140	And if intelligent design can't exist, why can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster?
2109992	2115255	Just for a brief commercial for Pastafarianism, our heaven has a beer volcano and a stripper factory.
2120999	2131365	So I recommend that everybody, or just worship the IPU, whatever, just go visit the site and soon you will become one of us.
2131565	2136948	Because, hey, if, you know, Scientology exists, why can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster exist?
2138673	2143496	Wait, there's actually a million dollar prize if you can prove that the Flying Spaghetti Monster does not exist.
2143796	2144636	There's no way to do it.
2144977	2145157	No.
2145957	2148559	In fact, there's tons of photographic evidence on the site.
2149059	2150039	Yeah, like drawings.
2150260	2153001	So... No, there's real life pictures.
2153041	2162286	If we go out to dinner at the Olive Garden, and I decide I don't like my food, because Olive Garden's food does taste a little bit, you know... It's an insult to Italians.
2162446	2162466	I...
2164088	2164629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2187046	2188927	This has the best Valentine on it.
2188947	2190727	It says, I love you, but you must die.
2190867	2195069	Rob, the best part about Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is that we have flimsy moral standards.
2197189	2199210	Can I get gay married in Pastafarian?
2199430	2200510	Absolutely.
2200731	2202511	Can't you be ordained in Pastafarian?
2202731	2204012	You can be ordained in anything.
2204052	2205692	God bless Pastafarian.
2205732	2206232	That's it.
2206552	2208733	I'm a registered minister in California.
2209173	2211014	Wasn't that from an episode of South Park?
2211932	2216434	By the end of March, I will be an ordained minister of Pastafarianism.
2216474	2217055	Wait a minute.
2217095	2223178	This was in an episode of South Park where Mrs. Garrison says something about the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
2223238	2225799	I remember this distinctly.
2225879	2230261	It came about when someone was trying... The whole thing with the... Intelligent design.
2230281	2231001	Intelligent design.
2231041	2236844	You know, God invented the Earth and that kind of thing, and they're trying to teach it in schools.
2236924	2237785	It's like, that's bullshit.
2237805	2238525	It's not science.
2238685	2240486	Whatever you may believe, it's not science.
2240993	2241954	It's not science.
2242234	2243215	There's nothing to back it up.
2243275	2249160	So these guys said, well, shit, we might as well have a pasta creature that can fly around and, you know, has a beer volcano in his head.
2249320	2253243	And they use the same type of disjointed argument, the intelligent design.
2255084	2260149	Every time you talk about a spaghetti monster, I think about Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs.
2260169	2260769	Yeah!
2261129	2262110	He ate himself.
2262370	2265333	I actually think that Pizza the Hut is one of the avatars of his noodley goodness.
2268415	2270497	It was fully inspired, I think.
2272065	2272985	It's a funny site.
2273005	2273566	Go see it.
2273626	2274306	God damn it.
2274686	2278848	I have been touched by the noodley appendage.
2279448	2280549	My heart is open.
2280969	2287772	We'll be changing the name of the show from Orange Lounge Radio Video Game Radio to Orange Lounge Radio from what the fuck ever.
2289273	2289913	Sorry, Rob.
2289973	2290493	No, it's alright.
2290533	2290833	It's funny.
2293134	2293654	It's alright.
2293715	2294695	Last week was just as bad.
2297296	2299257	Folks in chat seem to be digging it, so whatever.
2300097	2301558	As long as they're happy, Rob.
2302409	2303609	As long as they're happy.
2305050	2306850	That's right, as long as the masses are pleased.
2307370	2309610	I mean, seriously, we can't talk about video games all day long.
2309911	2311371	I mean, you have to have a life outside of games.
2312331	2312931	Really?
2313431	2314972	Or else when will you ever get an orgasm?
2315072	2315472	Seriously.
2315572	2316112	Whee!
2316232	2316752	Whee!
2317752	2319633	I found... I'm not going to say that on air.
2319793	2321413	But we are going to get back into some gaming news.
2321433	2323033	I'm not going to say that on air.
2323053	2323293	Are we?
2323653	2324414	Loki, yes?
2325374	2326754	Yes, if someone gives me a microphone.
2327307	2334390	Anyways, so the wonderful game that I've been playing, Crackdown, it only has 900 assuming points.
2334710	2336090	It is missing 100 of them.
2336370	2336650	I know.
2337671	2338311	Everyone pause.
2339972	2344874	That's tragic news, but they are coming later on in a free downloadable thing.
2345274	2349235	What they're going to be doing for the last 100 points, well, they don't really know yet.
2349295	2351396	What they're doing is watching how people play the game,
2352008	2352708	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2380919	2382560	I don't think there is a lobby in this game.
2409237	2414980	I know Loki likes Crackdown a whole lot, but there's only a few things I can think of that are even better than Crackdown.
2415020	2415620	Loki must agree.
2415941	2417221	And one of them would be zombies.
2418382	2420363	And there's really... Hell yeah, I love zombies.
2420563	2422264	There's only really one thing... What?
2422384	2423104	Loki disagrees.
2423144	2424425	Zombies are not better than Crackdown?
2424465	2424885	No, they're not.
2425085	2425485	Well, okay.
2425926	2426886	Crack is better than Crackdown.
2426906	2427386	No, you're wrong.
2427446	2427846	That's okay.
2429047	2433990	There's only one thing better than zombies, believe it or not, and that would be Hideo Kojima.
2435570	2436831	And would you believe...
2437549	2444015	That the meeting of this awesomeness, these two worlds of awesome, could be in the near future.
2445877	2452364	Hideo Kojima spoke to Edge Magazine and said the following, quote, of course Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid, blah, blah, blah.
2452644	2455487	Quote, the zombie idea I have is a bit different.
2455887	2458730	Imagine a large town where half the inhabitants are zombies.
2459190	2461973	Users would subscribe, get inside the town, and get bitten.
2462406	2465147	At that stage, they become undead and can't control their character.
2465467	2467267	All they can do is modify the camera angles.
2467567	2470648	They would see their character attacking humans and have to pay to just watch.
2471108	2475869	The only way they could end it is by opening another account, hunting themselves down, and killing themselves.
2476309	2479310	Of course, the problem is that your second character can get bitten as well.
2479590	2481271	Wasn't this already done in a Resident Evil game?
2482531	2484231	I think of Infected for PSP.
2484271	2489312	No, there was, I want to say a Resident Evil game that was played online.
2489432	2489793	Outbreak?
2490473	2491533	Yeah, I think it might have been Outbreak.
2491983	2494724	Hideo Kojima Adventures in Nudie Island Half The Residence Hot Naked Chicks
2522162	2522502	Okay?
2524103	2529365	You would have people subscribing four times just to have four different people in this fucking island.
2529765	2534026	And I tell ya, that is gonna be better than any fucking zombie game ever.
2534126	2535167	Beauty and the Geek MMO?
2535287	2536087	And you know what happens?
2536467	2544530	And if you get bitten by the naked chicks, you know, if you're into that kind of thing, then you turn into another naked chick or something.
2544630	2549492	Isn't the downside, though, that half of those quote-unquote naked chicks are men playing as naked chicks?
2552052	2552792	That would be me.
2555053	2555994	Girls don't play video games.
2556034	2557615	I always play women in MMOs, always.
2558135	2564038	That's why, I don't know, the naked chicks would be only controlled by AI, so it'd never be men playing.
2564519	2566900	Oh, so you're never actually having real sex, ever.
2567701	2569842	Doesn't matter, you're never having real sex in this game anyways.
2569862	2571543	If you want real sex, go and fucking get a woman.
2572463	2577346	Festering Rash in our chat, which I believe is just DMN under a different name, says, Loki, it's called Second Life.
2579551	2580051	Touche!
2606047	2606707	Not lesbians.
2607108	2607528	Sorry, Chris.
2607928	2611010	But, like, you know, hardcore, like, guy-on-guy action.
2612111	2613071	No, I said Chris.
2614412	2615272	No, not Shane.
2615493	2616593	I'm sorry you're here.
2617794	2618074	Alright.
2619175	2620796	I love one-sided conversations on the radio.
2621736	2622336	So professional.
2622997	2623237	Anyhow.
2624338	2624898	Shall we move on?
2625858	2626499	Why not?
2626859	2627399	You know what?
2627600	2628420	I have better things to do.
2628480	2630861	No, I'm kidding.
2633243	2634804	For everybody who was...
2635831	2640393	into Amplitude who played Amplitude Online.
2641454	2645455	Sony is giving the online server the boot right at the ass.
2646316	2651278	The Amplitude online server is going away.
2652238	2655460	It will be, I believe actually was it down now?
2656120	2657541	It went off on Sunday, right?
2658821	2660582	I think today was the last hurrah.
2661683	2663805	7pm Eastern Time, so it's gone already.
2664705	2666506	Aww, that's sad, kinda.
2666667	2671190	That's so sad that a game that's a few years old loses its online content.
2671210	2672190	Buy a new game!
2673471	2676133	How about they make one as good as Amplitude?
2676173	2677254	That would be awesome.
2677334	2678975	Give me Guitar Hero Online.
2681316	2681837	You jerk.
2682257	2684639	I don't care if Marissa hates Guitar Hero, I'd play it.
2686820	2688802	I liked Amplitude and I did play it online.
2688842	2689402	Of course, not
2689864	2692966	Not in two years, but lately I have, Chris.
2694987	2697268	Okay, this is not the Let's Cry About Rob Not Getting Laid show.
2698249	2698829	Hey, guess what?
2698969	2699149	What?
2699429	2710836	If you thought that Gran Turismo HD was an awesome preview of what Gran Turismo 5 may be someday, whenever the fuck it comes out, well, guess what?
2711236	2716859	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is coming out later this year, and it's supposed to be
2717503	2720745	Yet another fucking demo of what Gran Turismo 5 is going to be.
2722206	2722846	Hurrah.
2723467	2729791	And actually they were saying that if, I think the original Gran Turismo 4 prologue, you actually have to buy that.
2730531	2733273	So, I don't know.
2733393	2735394	Great, another fucking demo of Gran Turismo.
2735454	2735814	Guess what?
2735954	2736815	The first one sucked.
2737335	2738056	I didn't like it.
2738656	2739256	The second one?
2739577	2740657	Probably not going to download it.
2741378	2742218	Gran Turismo 5?
2742518	2743699	Probably not going to buy it.
2744440	2746561	So, hooray.
2749178	2755079	James Patrick in chat commenting on the MMO thing says, Mass Effect will probably have gay romance.
2755139	2756299	Is Sky looking forward to that?
2756799	2762560	No, because as I said earlier, I always play chicks in MMOs because everybody's nicer to you when you're a chick in an MMO.
2763081	2764661	And I don't want to do a lesbian thing.
2764681	2765201	That's gross.
2766041	2767461	Yeah, World of Warcraft people.
2767981	2769522	Yeah, but first of all, fuck you.
2770262	2771362	Second of all... Right now?
2772422	2773342	Yeah, right now, Rob.
2774943	2775963	Punch fans back on.
2777003	2780526	I just think that's a part of the history of the internet, because my father...
2805029	2811090	I almost want to make a gay.com account right now impersonating as a woman I'll put Chris's picture as my profile or something
2833106	2835027	and go into a chat room and put, hey, lezzies.
2835848	2836949	See what happens.
2837789	2847296	We were going to do that for my ex-boyfriend, who is so totally gay, as an April Fool's joke, put his profile and his address and stuff.
2847316	2848217	That's so wrong.
2849177	2851979	He needs help admitting his gayness.
2852080	2852600	Yeah, okay.
2854918	2856499	This show is very gay today, I'm sorry.
2856519	2858380	The first step is admitting you're gay.
2858440	2859120	We already did that.
2881793	2886515	1-877-GAME-OLR is only local in the United States and Canada, meaning that's where it's only toll free.
2886875	2893957	If you are abroad in another country, we encourage you to download Skype and call us on our username, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
2894397	2895758	They're all going to call in for Marissa.
2896458	2897338	We'll see what happens.
2897679	2899139	Let's go to the first call, boys and girls.
2900660	2901820	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2901840	2902240	Who's this?
2904341	2905461	Did I not actually pick up a call?
2905521	2905801	My bad.
2906181	2907202	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2907222	2907542	Who's this?
2908832	2910573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2938973	2939333	DT?
2940733	2941194	Say no.
2941434	2942514	My husband will hunt you down.
2942574	2942994	Kind of.
2943034	2943794	He says kind of.
2944134	2944875	Oh, yeah.
2944915	2946095	No, no, no.
2946295	2947295	Dan will step on you.
2947395	2949536	He's a groupie that respects boundaries.
2949676	2949936	Yeah.
2950236	2950676	That's fair.
2951236	2952077	I prefer fanboys.
2952477	2952797	All right.
2953317	2955317	Well, what kind of games have you been playing this week, Dark Tetsuya?
2956438	2959078	Just stuff on the league.
2959098	2962259	There must have been something that compelled you to pick up the phone and call in.
2962319	2965460	Was there a story tonight that particularly touched a nerve with you?
2966741	2968441	Well, the AOU stuff.
2969319	2972860	Ah, the arcade stuff we talked about in Part 8, like the Silent Hill game and DDR Supernova.
2973080	2973780	What do you think of all that?
2975161	2976201	Oh, it sounds pretty cool.
2976241	2977882	I'm stoked about Supernova 2.
2979882	2985344	Yeah, did you think Supernova was a real, like, did it kind of rescue the DDR series?
2985564	2987505	I think so.
2988425	2988945	Very cool.
2989025	2991526	What features would you like to see new in Supernova 2?
2991866	2994987	I mean, just new songs, or what would you like to see Konami do with Supernova 2?
2996636	3000618	Well, except in the new song, they should probably put in the link mode.
3001959	3002879	Ah, link mode.
3003500	3007122	Ah, so like you can use your memory card from the home version on the arcade.
3007142	3007742	That's a good idea.
3008122	3008863	Hopefully it'll happen.
3009963	3011464	Do you like to track your data?
3012625	3012925	Yeah.
3014426	3020469	Actdeft, who changed his name to ActdeftMarissaFan in chat, says remember to put in link mode.
3020489	3020829	There you go.
3021269	3021790	Very cool.
3022850	3024411	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dr. Tsuyo?
3025925	3027967	I just thought that Silent Hill game was cool.
3028327	3029208	Yeah, it does.
3029368	3033031	Do you think Silent Hill's going to work as a first-person shooter?
3034393	3034893	It might.
3035594	3037155	I guess we'll see when we play the game, huh?
3038396	3038616	Yeah.
3038796	3040138	Do you think the graphics look okay?
3040318	3046003	I mean, DarkSakura was kind of knocking the graphics earlier, saying that PlayStation 2 had better graphics.
3046023	3046503	What do you think?
3047224	3047504	Right.
3048465	3050286	No, no, they look pretty good.
3051087	3051948	Kind of atmospheric.
3052608	3054750	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3082248	3086091	I think Silent Hill's going to suck as a first-person shooter.
3086732	3088753	Why do you think it's going to suck as a first-person shooter?
3089854	3090415	I don't know.
3090715	3095199	It's just not going to be atmospheric enough, I don't think.
3095719	3100523	Do you think it's going to fall into the same pattern that the Resident Evil Gun Survivor games did?
3101384	3102625	Yes, definitely.
3102645	3104887	You know, I actually liked the second one.
3104947	3110572	I got to play the Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, and I thought it was pretty cool, but...
3112559	3115862	I'm really trying to reserve my judgment for actually playing it.
3115942	3116923	I just love Silent Hill.
3119465	3123909	But nah, I like the atmosphere and the whole ambience about it.
3124549	3125330	I don't think it'll work.
3125810	3126891	What do you think would make it cool?
3130414	3131535	Apart from Pyramid Heads.
3133196	3134037	But it has nurses!
3136779	3137220	I don't know.
3138000	3140542	I'm just not a really big fan of first person shooters, I guess.
3141954	3146537	So if you were going to design a Silent Hill arcade game, how would you make it?
3149459	3151040	I probably wouldn't make one, to be honest.
3152761	3153182	Fair enough.
3154382	3161267	Alright, well, I think you have a fan here in studio who wanted to say hello to you, Sesha, since you called in.
3161287	3162948	Go ahead and say hello.
3163148	3164789	Hi, hot, sexy British guy.
3166370	3167731	That's Rice Princess, by the way.
3168092	3169112	Hey, Rice Princess.
3169352	3169933	How's it going?
3169953	3170113	Good.
3172312	3173353	I'm really tired, actually.
3173373	3174134	It's 5 a.m.
3174955	3175575	Oh, my God.
3175595	3178198	Aw, and he stayed up to listen to us.
3179039	3181241	No, to listen to us, right?
3181261	3182141	Princess, not you.
3182202	3183963	Okay, I'm going to go and cry in a corner.
3184003	3184183	Not true.
3184203	3185645	He did ask about her.
3187026	3188307	Aw, that's so sweet.
3188367	3189128	And he's all sexy.
3189148	3190930	You guys should add each other on MySpace or something.
3190970	3193152	Oh, my God, we totally should.
3193172	3194473	Do you use MySpace, Sesha?
3195700	3197061	Yeah, I do.
3197201	3201445	Oh, type it to Sky in the chat room.
3201505	3203406	He's on my friends list.
3203486	3203907	Oh, is he?
3204267	3204567	Really?
3205808	3206268	Well, now.
3207249	3207630	All right.
3207750	3208370	Well, there you go.
3208590	3211833	You don't have a girlfriend that's going to get pissed if you're talking to Rice Princess online, are you?
3212634	3212874	No.
3213074	3213294	Okay.
3213834	3214015	All right.
3214035	3214395	There you go.
3214615	3214975	Sweet.
3215236	3215536	All right.
3215996	3220500	Because she loves Silent Hill and could talk all about the first person games with you, I guess.
3220620	3220900	I don't know.
3221400	3221661	Yeah.
3221881	3222141	All right.
3222181	3223082	She might convince me.
3223987	3225988	Oh, hey.
3226048	3227669	So, I've got a bet going now.
3227969	3229690	Why, what's that?
3231151	3232332	I bet Irene can convince.
3233653	3234293	Oh, man.
3235413	3235794	I'll give you $50.
3236194	3236914	No, I'm kidding.
3237214	3239316	Which is like next to nothing in pounds, right?
3239416	3241417	Yeah, that's totally nothing at all.
3242421	3242822	See you guys.
3242842	3243442	Bye, sexy British guy.
3261021	3262182	Have you ever even seen a picture?
3262442	3263082	No, I don't care.
3263123	3264303	He sounds hot.
3264383	3266425	That's very not superficial of you.
3266485	3267205	That's very nice.
3267406	3268206	I know.
3268226	3270528	No, he sounds really hot, dude.
3270648	3271448	I saw his picture.
3271468	3271989	He's cute.
3272649	3273530	Note to all guys.
3273610	3274470	I think he's cute.
3274530	3275671	Get fake British accents.
3275871	3276252	It'll work.
3278533	3286199	Well, next week on Orange Sounds Radio, we're going to be talking about... Instant softie there.
3286239	3286719	Hello.
3286739	3287960	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
3288835	3290016	Is that what I'm doing wrong?
3290076	3291357	Is that why I can't get laid?
3295380	3297722	Is that why I haven't had a date in so long?
3298002	3299583	Well, let's go to another call, shall we?
3299603	3302305	Hello, you're on Tea with Orange Lounge Radio.
3302325	3302626	Who's this?
3310836	3312277	Oh god, that voice turned me on.
3312297	3314918	Hi, DMN!
3314978	3317539	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you.
3317759	3319560	Hi, DMN.
3319640	3320500	Right now!
3321300	3322461	Hi, everybody.
3322721	3322881	Hi!
3323381	3326403	You had to come to my birthday party, you bastard.
3327443	3328263	I'll try.
3328623	3328864	Okay.
3331004	3333746	Something about Crackdown I actually wanted to talk about.
3333766	3335506	Alright, what's that?
3336007	3339288	I don't know if any of you guys heard, but a Halo 3 demo came with Crackdown.
3340396	3341977	No, no, no, no, careful.
3342318	3343559	Don't call it a demo.
3343659	3344359	It's a beta.
3344499	3347802	Bill Gates will personally come sodomize you if you call it a demo.
3347822	3348963	It doesn't come with a demo.
3349103	3350824	It will be available for download later.
3351885	3363694	But here's the thing I don't get is that rabid Halo fanboys who wank off to Master Chief are basically saying, Oh my God, I have to pay $60 to play the beta.
3363954	3364675	It's a beta.
3364695	3364775	Yeah.
3365566	3375914	No you don't, you could have done all those other things like register and be drawn randomly or play Halo 2 for some amount of time and be the first 13,333 people.
3376154	3379857	Or you could unbunch your wedgie and just wait for the real game to come out.
3380523	3381324	And that's what I'm saying.
3381704	3382965	It's a beta test.
3383345	3387589	It's one of the first console games I've ever known of that's having a public beta test.
3387609	3389831	It's like I was saying earlier in the show.
3390051	3398938	Even though 11 billion people are in the Halo 3 beta, and I'm very sorry to Mike W. who was complaining earlier about being a Halo fan and being the only person not in the beta.
3398999	3400460	I'm not in the beta either, but I don't care.
3401601	3405264	For some reason, people want to be in this beta because it makes their internet penis bigger.
3405304	3407806	Because it's like, I was in the Halo 3 beta.
3407866	3409027	Well, you and half the internet.
3411729	3412809	It's pretty ridiculous.
3414671	3416612	Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, DMN?
3417653	3420554	Uh, STFU, we're looking for a guest.
3420715	3422876	Anybody who's listening live would like to be a guest.
3423296	3425858	We're taping Tuesday night, so shoot me an eye.
3425878	3427179	Why don't you have Rice Princess as a guest?
3427699	3428299	Oh, DarkSakura.
3428320	3430681	I want to, but I'm actually, and I was going to say something about that.
3431021	3433623	I forgot that my class that I thought was Friday is actually on Tuesday.
3434363	3435804	I'm actually taking chakra mapping.
3436485	3437245	Metaphysical shit.
3437786	3439247	At my massage therapy school.
3439407	3439727	Interesting.
3440972	3442913	Do you want me to manipulate your energy, DMN?
3444273	3445714	I don't have any energy today.
3445954	3446574	I ran out of it.
3447254	3448214	Why don't you have Marissa on?
3450195	3455657	She's welcome to come on if she wants.
3455877	3456197	Whee!
3456977	3464939	I say you get a bunch of girls on your show this week and see how you like it when you have more girls than guys on the show.
3466220	3467160	I see what you did there.
3467180	3469101	You kind of put your own show name in there.
3470703	3470983	All right.
3471884	3474566	Tune in to SCFU on Thursday nights right here on Orange Laundry.
3474626	3475267	It's 7 o'clock Pacific.
3475307	3476068	It's a good time.
3477569	3477909	Usually.
3478570	3479310	Have a good one, DMN.
3479550	3479931	Bye.
3480471	3480591	Bye.
3480731	3481032	Bye.
3481372	3482593	Wait, do we have a picture?
3482613	3483814	Wait, is this a picture?
3484154	3484394	Yeah.
3484615	3484875	All right.
3484895	3485555	I want to see the British guy.
3485736	3486036	I know.
3486076	3486736	We all want to see.
3486816	3487757	Rice Princess ran over.
3487797	3488077	Let's see.
3488118	3488458	Let's see.
3490159	3490279	Oh.
3490319	3491140	British guy's hot.
3491941	3492901	He's kind of young.
3492922	3495384	Yeah, but he's still hot.
3495984	3496905	British guy is hot.
3498117	3499417	You're going to scare the poor guy off.
3499497	3500058	Dude, you're a pimp, man.
3500078	3500998	He's never going to come to chat again.
3501018	3502058	He's never going to come to chat again.
3502078	3503438	Look at his other pictures real quick.
3503658	3504099	All right.
3504539	3506259	Even Shane, like, randomly appeared out of nowhere.
3506799	3508300	I heard something about a British guy.
3508320	3510640	Dude, he's got... Okay, that's awesome.
3510900	3511901	He's got very nice eyes.
3513301	3513601	All right.
3513661	3515161	Anyway, can we go to another call?
3515402	3516442	May we please go to another call?
3516522	3517642	All right, let's go to another call.
3518282	3519483	Hi, you're on Orange Watch Radio.
3519503	3519843	Who's this?
3521523	3522823	No, my last name.
3523144	3524564	Hi, Rana.
3525583	3526363	It's not Ranma.
3526484	3527704	Is this Ranma?
3529725	3530226	Who is it?
3530806	3532647	It's Extover calling.
3532767	3534008	Shut up, Extover!
3534028	3535529	It's Extover calling from the living room.
3536709	3538110	I'm so not Ranma.
3538130	3539231	That's so funny.
3540852	3542413	Did I sound black?
3542533	3545034	No, I'm totally white.
3545174	3553239	Okay, the few times that I've been on this show and Ranma has called in, he's like scratchy like he's calling from his cell phone because his what's it called?
3553359	3554660	Get off the fucking phone!
3556347	3558508	Oh, that makes sense.
3558888	3559889	Anyway, bye!
3560529	3560849	Fucker.
3561990	3562750	No cookie!
3567232	3568012	I hate this show.
3568873	3573795	By the way, by the way, Marissa, Actdeft is now ActdeftMarissaFan.
3573895	3574996	Yay!
3575036	3576096	We gotta go, we gotta go to another call.
3576116	3576936	Hi, you're on Orange Taunch Radio.
3576956	3577277	Who's this?
3579918	3580298	Static.
3581618	3581999	Hello?
3582119	3582579	Can you hear us?
3584969	3592134	Okay, unfortunately that caller did not go through, and it was a new caller, and I feel bad that I had to hang up, but... No, you don't.
3592634	3598538	Well, you know, I just, you know, I appreciate new people taking the effort to call in, but unfortunately we couldn't hear you.
3598659	3599679	Maybe there was lag or something.
3599699	3600860	Actdeft says, heart, Marissa.
3601861	3602401	Heart, you too.
3602481	3605463	Here's also a PSA for any new caller from the show.
3605864	3608946	I know, and that's why I felt bad, because I wanted to hear from Uni.
3609006	3609966	Use the power of evil.
3610227	3611147	All right, that's all right.
3612448	3613669	We'll go to another call in the meantime.
3614332	3615613	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
3615633	3615993	Who's this?
3616773	3619915	This is a long-time listener, Dark Knight, rising from the dead.
3620395	3621435	Hi, Dark Knight.
3621455	3622296	Hi, it's DK.
3622416	3624137	It's been a long time since we heard from you, buddy.
3624157	3624737	What's on your mind?
3625737	3626418	Nothing much.
3626738	3630159	I thought I might give... Ooh, hold on.
3630179	3630399	I know.
3630439	3631740	Feedback's horrible, isn't it?
3632380	3633281	He's my southern buddy.
3634801	3636862	Okay, I'm good.
3636882	3640544	Yeah, I just want to give a little mini-review on Diddy Kong.
3640564	3642465	I saw it in the chat room earlier about it.
3642782	3643262	Please do.
3643302	3644163	I haven't played this game yet.
3644183	3645123	I'm curious if I should pick it up.
3646764	3651246	It's okay, but like they said, it's more like a rehash of the N64 version.
3652866	3653227	Really?
3654127	3656068	It seemed like a rehash of the N64 version.
3656308	3661150	The only difference is that some of the minigames will incorporate the use of the stylus.
3661850	3668293	Is it sort of like how Mario on the DS, the launch title, was just kind of Mario 64 with some extra frills?
3670828	3671368	Exactly.
3672649	3675069	Like I said, it was more of a rehash, if anything else.
3676390	3680071	Like when you're doing your turbo boost, you know how on the N64 one you usually hit the buttons?
3680551	3685713	To do the turbo boost on this one, you actually got to use the stylus to boost your level up to do the boost.
3687553	3689054	Well, would you recommend the game to others?
3690734	3691794	Yeah, no.
3692855	3693315	What was it?
3693355	3694555	Yeah, yes, no?
3694615	3695255	Yeah, you know?
3696216	3697576	Yeah, you know.
3697596	3697856	I mean...
3701212	3709055	Yes to some diehard fans, but if you've never played Diddy Kong before or something like that, you might want to pass.
3709955	3714717	So people that are expecting to play Mario Kart DS Part 2, they're going to be disappointed, you think?
3715397	3717618	Just about, if anything else.
3718498	3720239	Alright, well, so noted.
3720639	3722520	Anything else you want to comment on on tonight's show?
3723499	3726240	Like I said, it's been a long time calling the show.
3726280	3728041	I miss talking to y'all guys at times.
3728181	3731823	Well, we miss having you call in, so feel free to call us anytime.
3731843	3732543	You know where to find us.
3733524	3741448	Yeah, usually, though, I'm calling on Travis' show, and he can tell you that I have been a good appearance on that show lately.
3742128	3747191	Travis has a great show, and all the callers just enhance to that show, no matter how good or bad they are.
3747271	3748071	So it's a good time.
3748723	3752206	Especially since he has a NASCAR partner, so yeah.
3752246	3753928	That's Saturday nights on Orange Launch Radio, by the way.
3753968	3754348	Check it out.
3754388	3754909	Travis Donovan.
3755209	3757551	All right, Dark Knight, have a good one, and thanks so much for your call.
3758092	3758452	No problem.
3758472	3758932	You have a good night.
3759012	3759373	You too.
3759913	3760394	Later, guys.
3760414	3760814	Later.
3760914	3761274	Bye.
3761855	3762275	Bye.
3762375	3762696	Bye.
3763036	3764918	I like hearing from Dark Knight.
3765418	3766759	I like hearing from all our callers.
3767944	3772807	If you're wondering and you're sitting at home and asking yourself, why do the same people call in every week?
3773107	3773928	Because they can.
3774128	3775709	Orange Lounge Radio is an open forum.
3776009	3781992	And if you are sick and tired of hearing the same people every week on this show, as awesome as they are, you need to start calling in too.
3782072	3785234	And you can do that by listening to us Sunday nights live at 6 o'clock Pacific time.
3785715	3788076	Or you can leave us a voicemail at any time during the week.
3788116	3790517	We haven't had a lot of them lately, so we haven't had anything to play.
3790838	3794440	But 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number if you ever want to leave a voicemail.
3794920	3796041	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3796081	3796441	Who's this?
3798482	3801084	Hey there, this is Let's Have Tea.
3801285	3802225	Hi, what's up, G?
3802326	3802726	Is that it?
3804087	3804748	Let's have tea.
3804768	3806149	Oh, let's have tea.
3806229	3807710	I thought he said, what's up, G?
3808811	3809812	Word, yo!
3810073	3811454	Did I fuck up that name?
3811694	3812114	My bad.
3812375	3814056	I actually had a little tea earlier.
3814637	3816098	What's on your mind, Let's Have Tea?
3817960	3822464	I was actually wondering what your thoughts was on the XNA thing.
3824620	3828761	On XNA, the amateur development studio for Xbox.
3829081	3830282	Anybody have a thought on this?
3830622	3832502	I talk too much on the show, so I'm deferring.
3832602	3835703	I have a thought that I really haven't cared too much about it.
3836603	3838344	But you're not really into the programming stuff.
3838364	3839444	You just want to play the game, right?
3839884	3840284	Oh, no.
3840344	3842065	I like seeing the behind-the-scenes stuff.
3842125	3845726	It's just I'm like... I guess maybe I'm too saturated right now.
3846566	3849667	Yeah, and maybe it's like for you... I go looking for behind-the-scenes stuff all the time.
3849707	3851467	I just got done watching behind-the-scenes of Silent Hill 3.
3852207	3853688	I think I would love to see...
3854855	3856657	I don't know a lick about video game programming.
3856677	3857477	XNA does nothing for me.
3882079	3890567	But I'm excited at the prospect of, you know, it's going to make original games because there's going to be independent developers, you know, one-man, two-man, three-man teams out there making their own games.
3890848	3894911	And I want to see some of those on, you know, Xbox Live and see what original content's out there.
3897614	3902078	I mean, look at some of the games that have been developed for the web that are starting to get big now.
3902118	3905081	You have Flow, Line Rider, you know, those types of things.
3905141	3906843	I think XNA could produce more stuff like that.
3909400	3910281	Oh yeah, definitely.
3910602	3911643	I'm on a few teams for 3D modeling and such.
3911683	3912103	Excuse me?
3912143	3915487	The 3D modeling is hard stuff, so.
3934361	3941165	I think we're having a little bit of lag and that happens because our internet's getting hammered here.
3941945	3946488	I guess I'll ask you one last question and hopefully you can make this out.
3946608	3949810	What would be your response to this question?
3949890	3953472	What do you hope XNA can accomplish in the next six months, a year?
3955753	3960656	I'm really looking forward to seeing more original content.
3961363	3968004	because most game developers now are too afraid of making something new rather than just continuing with sequels and such.
3968884	3977426	So XNA will be able to have independent developers and small online teams be able to make something new and original.
3980506	3980826	All right.
3980886	3981626	Well, good luck.
3981686	3984507	It sounds like you're doing some of that XNA stuff yourself.
3984547	3988068	So good luck to the things that you're modeling and all that.
3988168	3990568	And let us know if you work on any games that show up
3992834	4003016	I think that's a good idea, actually, because it seems like, to be vulgar, as I usually am, that games are just turning into long series of porns with the same name.
4003796	4006237	You know, Depressed Men 10.
4007177	4015119	Some original games would be nice, and again, I'm not well-versed in the PSP at all, but I actually gave it to my ex-boyfriend, being very stupid and very broken.
4015239	4019420	I forgot to get him a game as well, but he didn't care because he was excited about everything that was homebrew.
4020180	4020980	I have to say...
4021502	4026065	That is some amazing insight from a casual gamer that games are starting to sound like porn titles.
4026705	4030667	Because you're kind of right, and I've never thought about it that way before, but it's kind of true.
4030788	4031648	Cooking Mama.
4033729	4036791	Let's poke Mama's steak.
4036891	4038732	Mama likes hot, press that steak.
4038912	4039813	Let's have tea.
4041174	4042534	Thanks so much for the call, okay, buddy?
4042755	4044035	Of course.
4044295	4044856	Have a good one.
4046721	4047602	What's up, G?
4047642	4048242	What's up, G?
4048342	4048702	What's up, G?
4048722	4048963	What's up, G?
4075980	4079463	I played it once.
4079483	4081605	Lesbians love sheep.
4085648	4087309	I don't know what that means, but I don't even want to know.
4087650	4089171	I like my plushie from Harvest Moon.
4089191	4090252	But you don't really play the games?
4090332	4091012	Not really.
4091032	4094275	I used to just watch people play it, and I thought it was amusing.
4094295	4094856	You got one.
4094896	4095896	Are you a Harvest Moon player?
4096497	4097197	Yes, I am.
4098178	4105184	My sister and mom got me Harvest Moon More Friends of Mineral Town for Christmas.
4106922	4112287	And, seriously, that game is like crack.
4112468	4119174	I mean, my sister and I would play it just, you know, to like say, who's going to marry who or something.
4119194	4122417	It was really stupid.
4122897	4127121	Well, okay, try to sell me on this game for a minute, because I'm not a huge Harvest Moon person.
4127742	4129083	Why should I play Harvest Moon?
4129864	4131245	Well, you start out...
4131903	4137746	You're trying to save... Well, the first one I played, you are trying to save this town called Mineral Town.
4138627	4149373	And basically, if you take three years to sell as many crops as you can, bring as much reputation to the town, which is Mineral Town... Wait, I've got to play this game for three years?
4150253	4153335	No, the days last a few hours, right?
4153675	4158218	The days last for about ten minutes, to be totally honest.
4159939	4160099	And...
4161414	4170497	Well, it's kind of like that with the more friends of Miller Town, which you're basically playing as a female instead of a male.
4171237	4175158	And you can actually marry somebody on that game.
4176199	4182140	You can actually marry men when you're on the woman's version, and you can marry a woman on the men's version.
4182520	4183181	Lame.
4183521	4185121	No gay marriage.
4185161	4185801	Can you partner?
4186322	4187462	Can you get a civil union?
4188337	4189758	Uh, no, I'm sorry.
4189859	4190980	I played The Sims.
4191280	4191940	We're used to it.
4192301	4192761	We're used to it.
4193282	4199007	Alright, well, one more question for you, even though you're the one that called us.
4199127	4201549	What makes this game different from, like, Animal Crossing?
4203251	4204592	Well, you...
4206577	4209199	Okay, maybe the wrong person.
4209259	4218647	You don't have to go take the pink dresser from cat person's house to the dog person and then take a letter to the owl person.
4218968	4220789	You just grow shit and sell it.
4221410	4222491	And then you feed your dog.
4222571	4226874	I don't remember getting the sheep in Harvest Moon to say, you cunt.
4229417	4229857	Am I right?
4231118	4231959	That's totally true.
4233388	4235691	But you do have to comb your horse.
4236452	4237192	Yes, you do.
4237753	4239595	And you have to comb it all the time.
4239895	4241838	And kick your cow.
4242258	4243319	Do you get to tip the cows, though?
4244080	4244561	No, you can't.
4244601	4245262	I don't think you can.
4245662	4246403	Do you tip your cows?
4247244	4247564	No.
4247584	4249166	I don't think they give you that option.
4249266	4251729	Uni, I know your name is really simple, but I love it.
4252871	4256013	I just saw a thing with a unicorn today and I geeked out because of my girl.
4257534	4260837	If I remember right, isn't it based off of Yuna from Final Fantasy X?
4261217	4261738	Uh-huh, yes.
4262478	4266201	That was my DDR nickname back when I was playing in Rhode Island.
4267162	4268723	At least your teacher didn't name you.
4269024	4273027	A lot of girls that are into games seem to really enjoy Yuni.
4273407	4274188	I mean, not Yuni.
4274408	4275849	If they like Yuni, they sure do.
4276129	4277911	I mean, Yuna from Final Fantasy X.
4278840	4281262	She's like a role model for girls or something.
4281382	4283304	I'm actually a lot like her in real life.
4283504	4284325	You mean she's normal?
4284505	4285166	Yeah, I know.
4285266	4285566	Weird, huh?
4285586	4287008	There you go.
4288089	4290511	Not that there's anything wrong with the big boobies.
4290591	4292353	There's nothing wrong with the big boobies at all.
4293274	4294395	Yeah.
4294915	4297077	Anyways, I should let you guys go.
4297097	4297838	Yeah, thanks.
4297858	4298999	Thank you for the advice.
4299019	4299900	We love you, Uni.
4299920	4301101	All right, take care, Uni.
4301121	4301782	Thanks for the call.
4301822	4302442	We appreciate it.
4303443	4303844	Bye.
4303864	4304124	Bye.
4304781	4305141	All right.
4305462	4306222	I am so pathetic.
4306242	4309144	We'll probably do, like, one more call here on the show.
4309224	4319092	If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can always call us on the old-fashioned Skype line or whatever you want to do.
4319132	4319953	What was Yuna from?
4320513	4322354	Final Fantasy X. I've not played that game.
4322474	4322895	You should.
4322955	4323575	It's a good game.
4323655	4325577	Well, I haven't been able to pick it up, so that's why.
4326037	4327018	I saw a unicorn today.
4327038	4328559	I was like, unicorns, and I saw her name.
4328579	4329600	A unicorn?
4330400	4331761	That is so fucking pathetic.
4331802	4332682	Wow, you're interesting.
4333102	4333683	Oh, my God.
4334366	4334786	But I love you.
4335206	4336927	Alright, let's do at least one more call here.
4337147	4338087	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.
4338107	4338427	Who's this?
4339787	4340807	It's Raven's Dolphin.
4340907	4341707	Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
4341727	4342568	Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
4342588	4343348	What's on your mind, buddy?
4345028	4347089	I am the saddest attorney in the world.
4348189	4348929	I object to that.
4349409	4349889	Objection.
4350489	4351569	Overruled, motherfucker!
4352750	4354050	I am a legal secretary.
4354830	4356090	Well, thank you.
4356230	4358591	Alright, what is legally on your mind, dude?
4360051	4363412	Well, legally, I did get my hands on Phoenix Wright's Justice for All.
4363712	4364152	What'd you think?
4365723	4366243	I love it.
4366504	4373648	It is kind of like an attenuation of the game, but hey, it's Phoenix Wright, and you all should pick it up.
4373708	4374148	It's great.
4374448	4377290	Tell me what I'm in for if I've never played Phoenix Wright before.
4377330	4380412	What can I expect from Phoenix Wright, either the first or second one?
4382013	4391219	All right, this one, you know, Phoenix Wright's a text game, so you have to click a lot and read a lot, and you have to find clues and contradictions in the game.
4391519	4392960	And if you don't find things...
4393581	4395102	Things get a little hairy, you know.
4395122	4400165	If you mess up and show Judge the wrong kind of evidence, he will go, uh-uh, not true.
4400425	4401526	And he will go, bang.
4401546	4402547	And you'll look stupid.
4402567	4407109	Because the story is so insane and it's like Law and Order.
4407129	4409011	Have you ever played something like this before?
4423157	4424458	The story's so driven.
4424618	4426358	It's a very story-driven game.
4427279	4429420	You want to see how the story's progressing.
4430300	4432641	Like the Edgeworth trial, I'm not going to give away anything.
4432781	4435162	All I'm saying is, holy shit, holy shit.
4436063	4438524	So it's got a good story, like Law & Order, like an episode of Law & Order.
4438704	4439624	What about the girl with the whip?
4439764	4440144	Yeah.
4440985	4441825	What about the girl with the whip?
4441885	4444186	Oh my God.
4444226	4445246	Doesn't she make you miss things?
4447577	4448477	I like that girl.
4448537	4451278	I saw art stuff of her, and she was fucking hot.
4451518	4452658	Was that on, like, DeviantArt?
4452938	4453359	No!
4453639	4453739	Oh.
4454119	4456980	No, you do not go there for concept art.
4457020	4460561	You go there for porn, Rob.
4460681	4462741	What's the difference between a lawyer and a catfish?
4463061	4463281	What?
4463601	4466142	One's a scum-sucking bottom feeder, and the other's a fish.
4467663	4468623	Very nice, very nice.
4469803	4470983	Raven's dog.
4471264	4471604	Raven's dog.
4471624	4472064	Yeah, what else?
4481250	4481970	How did you fail?
4482030	4482831	I haven't heard this.
4482951	4488936	I love all games, but they almost produce too much show that I can't stay on top of it a lot.
4489316	4491778	So you have to kind of tell me, what were they saying?
4491798	4492199	Real quick.
4493480	4494421	Of course it was 360 fun because
4501755	4503536	You've got a bunch of hardcore gamers in there.
4503596	4514704	I'm not, well, I love everyone, but then, you know, if you put a bunch of hardcore gamers, they're going to pick the 360 because it's the best, and that's all I have to say.
4515124	4523269	And they ask me that, why does the graphics suck, and I go, they don't suck, it's because it's based off of GameCube architecture.
4523709	4530154	And then I defend it and say, the GameCube architecture is actually pretty strong, just look at Resident Evil 4.
4531198	4533900	I know, it's, you know, it's not like the graphics are bad.
4534520	4536822	It's just, it's gameplay versus graphics.
4537562	4539924	And that's not to say that the Xbox has crappy gameplay.
4540384	4542606	It's just that the Wii does something a little different.
4542626	4543206	They're different.
4543306	4545608	I don't, it's so hard to compare the two.
4546208	4546909	But, I don't know.
4547049	4547629	That's just my thought.
4547649	4548330	Because I love them both.
4548370	4549751	I'm totally a Wii 60 person.
4549851	4550351	I totally am.
4550891	4551212	That's me.
4551812	4553013	I'm not, I'm not sold on Sony.
4553513	4554534	I'm not sold on Sony yet.
4556395	4557796	At least this generation.
4558657	4560378	Last generation, I was totally an S2 fanboy.
4563539	4565080	Okay, that's it.
4565221	4565901	Yeah, we better go.
4566302	4567403	Take care, Ravenstolphin, though.
4567523	4569144	Have a nice one, and we appreciate you calling.
4569645	4570245	Okay, you too.
4570265	4570505	Bye.
4570525	4570966	Bye-bye.
4572487	4575490	Well, I know a lot of people have been trying to get through tonight, and I apologize.
4575530	4578573	We're not going to be able to take everyone's calls.
4579033	4582356	We've run a little long in both segments, if you can't tell, so we've got to wrap it up.
4583057	4584498	Any last-minute stories here in studio?
4586620	4587200	Yes, actually.
4587501	4587921	Okay, what's up?
4588832	4596974	Just for anyone who is a fan of Darwinia, Uplink, or Defcon, Introversion is actually stating that they're planning on putting out console games.
4596994	4606596	They haven't really said much yet, but there is a little bit of speculation that Subversion might be heading that way, which is a game they're currently developing.
4608436	4608776	Alright.
4609797	4615978	Anyways, there's a rumor going on saying that the next channel possibly for the Wii would be the Nintendo Power channel.
4617239	4618240	I heard about this.
4618300	4619681	That's interesting.
4621423	4621763	I don't know.
4621863	4624726	I wouldn't buy Nintendo Power, so I guess this would be the only way I'd see it.
4626447	4628169	Anywho... You better have Howard and Esther.
4629970	4636756	There's also another rumor saying that a PS3 will be released to compete with the Xbox 360 Core unit.
4637817	4643422	It, too, will not feature a hard drive as well, and possibly lower the price down to $250. $250.
4647483	4653684	I guess that's kind of cool, because, I mean, you can probably find a laptop hard drive for pretty cheap.
4654284	4654865	But, whatever.
4656945	4659386	Also, Final Furlong is coming to the Wii.
4659986	4663886	For those who may not know Final Furlong, Final Furlong is a horse racing game.
4664307	4667887	It was in the arcade, and when you play it, it makes it look like you're fucking a horse.
4668307	4669228	That game was great!
4669268	4671248	Hence, we used to call it the horse sex game.
4671368	4675229	So, in this, I guess it would be... Hunt the horse.
4675669	4675929	You know...
4677243	4679405	So is this, say, the cowboy ride a horse?
4680706	4694719	Also, in another Grand Theft Auto negative story, apparently Richard O. Jones, a writer for Black Voice News, wrote concerns about racial stereotypes in video games.
4695059	4700744	One such video game he's kind of mad at is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, in which Jones...
4701690	4713137	It says it relates to the player who assumes the lead character of Carl Johnson, a down-on-his-luck black criminal who roams the city streets stealing cars and helping gang members knock off rivals in drive-by shootings.
4714458	4719741	Okay, but apparently he didn't play the other games where he played other ethnicities doing the same damn thing.
4722523	4723463	We all hate equally.
4725404	4725785	Sides.
4726225	4729607	Yeah, hate knows no color boundaries.
4730447	4731208	Everybody hates.
4733227	4734788	That should be the next Wii channel.
4734848	4736949	Not everybody votes, everybody poops, everybody hates.
4738790	4740210	It's just a big bitch board.
4740271	4741111	What do you hate right now?
4742171	4742992	I hate OLR.
4743012	4745553	What do you hate more than anything at this very moment, Rob?
4746553	4747013	This show.
4747954	4748194	Chris?
4748694	4750295	I'm just kidding, I love this show.
4750355	4755477	I want to see a Wii webcam channel where you can go visit other people's webcams.
4756298	4757238	The Wii porn channel.
4758799	4760399	For people who have Wiis.
4760780	4761260	Wii Wiis.
4762318	4765880	PornTube!
4766060	4771583	What I hate more than anything right now is the fact that PornTube upgraded their Flash Player so I can no longer use it on my Wii.
4772904	4773384	Sad, huh?
4774765	4776666	I know.
4777366	4778187	Anything else from anyone?
4779567	4780048	I guess that's it.
4780068	4783469	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts if we can.
4784390	4790133	First off, before we wrap up the show, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into and supporting Independent Podcast Radio.
4790455	4794296	You guys are awesome, and we do this show for you guys, the loyal ones who listen to us.
4794756	4798177	All we ask, if you like the show, you'll notice no ads on our site.
4798657	4812180	No, I mean, live 365 ads, we can't control that because we, you know, they pay the royalty fees, so that's a small concession, but it's the site itself, no ads, podcast itself, you know, no ads as it stands right now, and no plans in the foreseeable future, although someday we may have to make money.
4812480	4818722	But we do this show, the goodness of our hearts, all we ask, tell one person about Orange Lounge Radio.
4818762	4819262	Even if it's your...
4819801	4823804	Least favorite person in the world, tell them about Orange Lounge Radio so that maybe they'll check it out.
4823924	4833630	Because that's the only way we can promote, because we don't have the marketing muscle of magazines and television channels and all that stuff.
4833970	4837513	All we have is us and you guys, the OL Army.
4838213	4840414	So, even Marissa's ex.
4840815	4841115	All right.
4841735	4844317	So tell somebody about Orange Lounge Radio, and that's all we ask.
4844605	4845306	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4865100	4866240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4889517	4916988	and it's like she's not having a happy time right now if she could she'd drop everything that she's doing and come out here to be less stressed but she's not she's sticking through school which was a really hard decision for her and stuff so if people can send out some good thoughts towards her go to her myspace or something give her a comment or something and make her happy just to let you know just to ease some of it because I think she needs it because I love her and she needs happy
4917881	4921844	Gaming Nerd says, God, why don't we all trade MySpaces so we can stalk one another?
4922124	4925506	You know, Orange Launch Radio has a MySpace, and you can add us.
4925626	4928148	It's MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
4928248	4928808	We're not hard to find.
4928828	4929869	But if you suck, I'm not adding you.
4931330	4931570	All right.
4932531	4935053	Thank you, and of course, you know, I love making... Speaking of you suck.
4936294	4936794	Marissa.
4937054	4937494	Yay!
4937815	4940096	Congratulations on your first full OLR episode.
4940376	4940957	And you know what?
4941437	4944719	Based on your comments you've been making, you're much more of a gamer than you lead on.
4944759	4944959	Yeah.
4944979	4946621	You follow this stuff more than you'd admit.
4946641	4946661	I...
4948153	4949934	You know more about gaming than I think you want to admit.
4950534	4952356	But thanks for coming and for your insight.
4952536	4953557	And what's your final thought?
4954137	4955418	Oh, yay, this is so much fun.
4955478	4959001	Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for putting up with my ass.
4960142	4963284	And my last... Oh, yay, hugs from Eggsy.
4964205	4965126	My final thought would be...
4966195	4967615	People at me on MySpace.
4967695	4968776	I hate MySpace, I do.
4969076	4970616	To be perfectly honest with those that don't like it.
4970656	4972697	But it's unfortunately a necessary evil.
4972837	4973097	It is.
4973317	4973837	It really is.
4973977	4975178	I say the same thing.
4975218	4976478	It's where the internet goes to die.
4976498	4977418	That's true.
4977438	4978639	I thought that was 4chan.
4979339	4980919	That too.
4981179	4982340	It's like cake or death.
4983340	4984120	4chan or MySpace.
4985000	4986281	So yes, my final thought is yay.
4986321	4987901	Thank you to everybody, especially fans.
4988081	4990022	Even if you're just fans for my boobies, that's fine too.
4991045	4992749	It's radio though, so it's hard.
4992769	4993611	It's really big though.
4994594	4995395	They are really big.
4995416	4998803	If you like me or if you want to see my boobies, well, not naked.
5000099	5018069	www.myspace.com slash M-A-R-I-S-S-A-M-E-I-Z-E-L or if you don't like Myspace and it's Myspace bad, just like sunlight, M-A-R-I-S-S-A-C-O-N-G-U-S-T-O at gmail.com.
5018229	5018569	Email me.
5018950	5019250	Whatever.
5019450	5019670	Cool.
5019750	5020491	This was so much fun.
5020551	5021071	Thank you again.
5021611	5022371	No problem.
5022571	5026072	And we'll have to play some folk rock on a later episode of Orange Lounge.
5026373	5027273	Oh, I get so many good friends.
5027373	5028413	Give the listeners some culture.
5029434	5030774	I've played James Hurley on my show before.
5031114	5032054	James Hurley is awesome.
5032174	5033355	And James Lee Stanley is my favorite.
5033375	5034515	He has the best sideburns ever.
5034995	5035315	He does.
5035395	5036016	He has pointy sideburns.
5036036	5037996	You need to play a Marissa song on the next pop-up at the volume.
5038196	5039417	If Marissa would give me some.
5039577	5039897	Oh, yay.
5039957	5046579	And just to promote a friend, James Lee Stanley is an awesome musician who put a picture of me in a Jessica Rabbit outfit on his album.
5046979	5049300	She's got that on her MySpace, too.
5051204	5051884	Anyway, I'm sorry.
5051944	5052785	Thank you guys so much.
5052845	5053385	It was a blast.
5053445	5053926	No problem.
5053946	5054666	Thank you for coming.
5054766	5056607	And ease up on the Guitar Hero hate.
5057228	5057768	All right.
5058108	5058969	Loki, your final thought.
5060149	5061290	I got to play more Crackdown.
5061410	5063511	Two of the three gangs done.
5063971	5064792	One last one left.
5065152	5066953	The Asians are always the hardest to kill.
5068674	5072096	I don't even know how to take that comment or what kind of hate mail we're going to get from that.
5073417	5075298	Rice Princess, do you have a final thought?
5075558	5076759	I like British guys.
5078292	5080074	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5109525	5110546	Kirby's my final thought.
5110786	5111907	DarkSakura.
5112928	5119332	If Megzi is listening by any chance, you fully have my sympathy because I am right now working full time, going to school 12 hours a week.
5120473	5125957	And actually this week I'm taking two extra classes and have to do 10 documented massages by the end of the year.
5126617	5127658	I'm sorry, by the end of March.
5129019	5131381	And then have to take more classes and then find a way to quit my job.
5133222	5135404	So I totally feel your pain.
5135964	5136785	I am suffering with you.
5138584	5139264	Megzi!
5139284	5141306	Okay, bye.
5142847	5143187	All right.
5143667	5146529	That concludes another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
5146549	5148931	Thank you guys so much for supporting Independent Radio.
5149151	5152693	And next week, we'll talk about video games at some point.
5153213	5153834	We promise.
