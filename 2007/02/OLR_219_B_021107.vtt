00:00.000 --> 00:26.360
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 219 for this February the 11th of 2007.

00:26.360 --> 00:31.200
If you're downloading this on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, welcome to the program.

00:31.200 --> 00:38.360
Keep in mind we tape this live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:38.360 --> 00:43.400
You can hear the show rebroadcast in its entirety before it hits the podcast stream at allgames.com

00:43.400 --> 00:48.800
Monday nights at 530 Pacific and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m. Pacific, or you can just wait until

00:48.800 --> 00:53.080
Wednesday or Thursday-ish when the show Part B makes it to the audio archive, whatever

00:53.080 --> 00:54.080
works for you.

00:54.080 --> 00:57.480
See, Orange Lounge Radio, we have multiple ways to get you the show that you've come

00:57.480 --> 01:01.360
to listen to, and we thank you for tuning into and supporting our program.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.440
You supporting independent radio are a real winner.

01:04.440 --> 01:08.480
Rob, where's the tape recorder that you're taping the show on?

01:08.480 --> 01:09.480
It's all in my brain.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.480
In the 80s?

01:10.480 --> 01:12.800
Back in the day, I used scripts for all this stuff.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
I don't even use them.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.800
It's all in my brain.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.880
I think your tape recorder is in the 80s where it belongs.

01:18.880 --> 01:22.000
By the way, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, it is a little bit

01:22.000 --> 01:24.540
of an off night tonight, and I blame our guests.

01:24.540 --> 01:29.280
But Dark Soccer is going to rescue us with some gaming news.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.280
I don't want to.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.280
You must.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.280
Help.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.280
You're our only help.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.280
Okay, how about this?

01:34.280 --> 01:35.280
It's movie news.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.280
That works.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.520
As long as it's not Uwe Boll.

01:38.520 --> 01:39.520
Shut up!

01:39.520 --> 01:43.280
Yes, it's going to be one of those shows tonight.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.280
Rob.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.280
What?

01:45.280 --> 01:46.280
Rob.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.280
What?

01:47.280 --> 01:48.280
Rob.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.280
I quit.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.280
Okay, so Sony.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.280
Good, my show now.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.760
Hi, you're listening to Jamie Lounge Radio.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.760
No.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.920
Did you hear that?

01:57.920 --> 01:59.560
That's the sound of a thousand people unsubscribing.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.560
There you go.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.560
You know what?

02:01.560 --> 02:03.880
That's the sound of my finger raised in tribute to you.

02:03.880 --> 02:04.880
Video game news.

02:04.880 --> 02:05.880
Do we ever do it on this program?

02:05.880 --> 02:13.360
Sony is making a Metal Gear movie produced by, was it the one who's producing the Ghost

02:13.360 --> 02:15.580
Rider movie?

02:15.580 --> 02:17.280
That is very cool stuff.

02:17.280 --> 02:28.240
It was actually announced by Studio Kojima at last E3 and basically as far as what's

02:28.240 --> 02:39.200
been quoted is that it's going to be a very, okay, this makes no sense.

02:39.200 --> 02:47.760
They're talking about a cinematic game, but they were talking about a movie.

02:47.760 --> 02:48.760
I don't get it.

02:48.760 --> 02:52.000
Well, because Metal Gear Solid is a very cinematic game.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.600
So basically they're saying because it's a cinematic.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.800
Oh, I misread it.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.800
That was me.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.640
Yeah, because it's a very cinematic game, it lends itself to a movie very simply.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.640
Very well.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.640
Yeah.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.640
Yeah.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.600
I completely, apparently I forgot how to read in my weekend area.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.320
That's why we're only, you know, that's why we're amateur radio.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.200
That's why we don't get paid for this.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.200
Whatever.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.360
Don't make me feel worse.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.360
Anyway.

03:15.360 --> 03:19.800
But yeah, I'm actually voting for the ride in sequel.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.800
The ride in sequel?

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Yeah.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
What?

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
UFO ending?

03:24.800 --> 03:25.800
What?

03:25.800 --> 03:26.800
No.

03:26.800 --> 03:27.800
Dog ending?

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
No.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.800
That's the Silent Helmet movie, not Metal Gear.

03:31.800 --> 03:38.640
So does that mean we're going to speculate about who's going to be playing all of the

03:38.640 --> 03:41.520
roles in the movie?

03:41.520 --> 03:45.800
Well garsh, Rice Princess, if you were to cast the Metal Gear Solid movie, who would

03:45.800 --> 03:49.200
you cast in the role of Snake?

03:49.200 --> 03:51.200
A snake?

03:51.200 --> 03:56.520
No, I would cast, why can I not?

03:56.520 --> 03:58.960
Matt Damon, because he plays everybody.

03:58.960 --> 03:59.960
Or Ben Affleck.

03:59.960 --> 04:00.960
Matt Damon.

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
Ben Affleck.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
Ben Affleck.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.480
Because apparently people think that he's such a universal actor that he can play any

04:07.480 --> 04:08.480
role ever.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.960
No, I know, I know who I want it to be.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.960
The guy who's his voice actor.

04:13.960 --> 04:14.960
David Tennant?

04:14.960 --> 04:15.960
No, David Hayter.

04:15.960 --> 04:16.960
Ah.

04:16.960 --> 04:22.360
Yeah, okay, I'm pulling up pictures of him and he's actually really cute and he would

04:22.360 --> 04:24.040
actually make a good snake.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.580
See here he is.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.620
As long as Loki plays- I'm going to send it to the chat room.

04:29.620 --> 04:32.500
As long as Loki plays the role of Tingle.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.500
That's according to GS68.

04:33.500 --> 04:39.880
Well no, because keep in mind, David Hayter, actually David Hayter wrote the first two

04:39.880 --> 04:45.040
X-Men movies, but he was also Solid Snake's voice actor, plus he's pretty freaking, he

04:45.040 --> 04:46.600
looks kind of like Snake too.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.140
DJ Jenai wins.

04:48.140 --> 04:51.440
He says Paul Reubens should play Snake.

04:51.440 --> 04:56.800
Yeah, apparently it's the Hollywood Reporter saying that Columbia Pictures is now currently

04:56.800 --> 05:03.360
negotiating the rights to mill your solid- Columbia is owned by Sony, so not a big surprise

05:03.360 --> 05:04.360
there.

05:04.360 --> 05:11.320
Anyways, what is kind of a big surprise though is Rockstar's brand new game, Manhunt 2, is

05:11.320 --> 05:15.080
coming to the Wii as well as Playstation 2 and PSP.

05:15.080 --> 05:21.000
For those who didn't play Manhunt 1, in Manhunt you actually play a psychopathic killer who

05:21.000 --> 05:29.480
has basically egged on to kill people in very violent ways, using everything from trash

05:29.480 --> 05:38.280
bags to shards of glass, and well, I guess we will actually get a murder simulator, which

05:38.280 --> 05:40.120
is awesome, and it's going to be very violent.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.640
Wait, so you can use a trash bag to kill someone?

05:42.640 --> 05:46.720
Yes, and it's great because you can use- Let's demonstrate in studio how that's done.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.600
Irene, if you would just sit still for a minute.

05:49.600 --> 05:56.860
Just kidding, we here at Orange Laundry do not endorse the actual killing of actual people.

05:56.860 --> 06:04.360
And then of course this got announced on February 6th, which just so happened, ironically enough,

06:04.360 --> 06:10.880
and I'm sure this is just pure coincidence, happened to be the anniversary of apparently

06:10.880 --> 06:19.660
a murder that was sought to be blamed on the original Manhunt game apparently.

06:19.660 --> 06:29.800
There was a 2004 incident where a kid, Steven Pacara, age 14, was murdered by his friend

06:29.800 --> 06:36.320
Warren LeBlanc, age 17, and of course they blamed the actions on the game, which was

06:36.320 --> 06:41.560
later disproved in court, but parents either way are still kind of pissed off that they

06:41.560 --> 06:44.400
made this announcement on the anniversary of that.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.400
Hooray!

06:45.400 --> 06:47.040
More murder games!

06:47.040 --> 06:49.360
I love this, and fuck those parents.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.240
Those parents are just jealous that they didn't think of it first.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.840
So you know what?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.880
Manhunt 2, hell yes.

06:55.880 --> 06:56.880
Wow.

06:56.880 --> 07:00.600
I apologize if I mispronounce this name.

07:00.600 --> 07:08.640
Kai Hate Wireless says, Manhunt 2 will get Wii recalls at Walmarts and Targets nationwide.

07:08.640 --> 07:11.760
Mike W says, murder games suck.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.560
Raven's Dolphin says, Manhunt for the Wii.

07:13.560 --> 07:17.040
For the win, FTW.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.400
Well, we shall see.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.320
Is Manhunt 2 a game that interests you?

07:22.320 --> 07:25.040
Dark Soccer, because you said earlier in the program you want games with more blood and

07:25.040 --> 07:28.560
more violence, and I don't know, killing people with a trash bag with your Wii mote.

07:28.560 --> 07:33.880
I think that that would be a very interesting place to time.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.760
I think that it should be Ultimate PMS Revenge, the game.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.760
Alright.

07:38.760 --> 07:42.600
She just doesn't like the title because it has man in it.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.760
Well, no, because that could also be women taking revenge off of male oppression.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.240
What if they called it Man Cunt?

07:48.240 --> 07:49.640
Would that appeal to you then?

07:49.640 --> 07:53.080
No, because then I'd start thinking of someone who's pre-op transgendered or something.

07:53.080 --> 07:57.080
Oh, god, I just threw up in my mouth.

07:57.080 --> 08:04.120
Let's switch topics to a Zorro game on the way to the Wii.

08:04.120 --> 08:10.440
Pronto Games is going to be bringing the destiny of Zorro to the Wii this holiday season.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.040
This was announced by Pronto Games.

08:13.040 --> 08:18.320
Pronto President and Creative Director Randy Angle said they hope to bring the player,

08:18.320 --> 08:21.320
quote, fully into the moment of Zoroness.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.400
This game is currently planned as a Wii exclusive.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
You know what that is?

08:24.400 --> 08:26.280
I swear to god, that's a quote.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.280
Fully into the moment of Zoroness.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.780
Ron, you have killed Irene.

08:28.780 --> 08:29.940
She is laughing to death.

08:29.940 --> 08:30.940
That's what it says.

08:30.940 --> 08:33.400
What would that be, like the 1920s?

08:33.400 --> 08:39.960
You all know that with that wiimote, you're going to have to do that stupid make a Z with

08:39.960 --> 08:41.000
your wiimote.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.240
How many times in the game do you think you're going to be required to go with a wiimote?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.760
I think that's the only point of the game.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.760
That's what you do.

08:48.760 --> 08:52.080
The objective is you try to make the Z.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.080
That's the game.

08:53.080 --> 08:57.600
That's how you fully embrace the Zoroness, is pfft, pfft, pfft.

08:57.600 --> 09:05.120
Yeah, and at the same time, you can fully embrace the Zoroness for buying the game.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.600
You know, they call him the gay blade.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.760
Oh, really?

09:09.760 --> 09:13.360
DJ, it's a new Zor...

09:13.360 --> 09:14.360
Whatever.

09:14.360 --> 09:21.480
DJ Jenai says, Zo, really?

09:21.480 --> 09:25.320
It's like this, Rob, it's just, it's like...

09:25.320 --> 09:27.360
Three snaps in Z formation?

09:27.360 --> 09:29.920
Did Loki just do three snaps in Z formation?

09:29.920 --> 09:31.560
I think that he did.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.560
Slash, slash, slash.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
What's going on?

09:33.560 --> 09:40.140
I give this game two snaps, a twist, and a kiss.

09:40.140 --> 09:41.440
I would not be buying this game.

09:41.440 --> 09:45.360
This is the single gayest show we've ever done.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.360
By the way, if...

09:46.360 --> 09:49.000
It's so gay that they'll be downloading rainbows.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.560
By the way, if you are listening for the first time, and you're like, that's wrong, I'm gonna

09:56.560 --> 09:57.960
call GLAAD on these people.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.440
Two of us are gay, so it's okay that we make these jokes.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.400
Me being one of them, Eddie the Gay being the other.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.400
So just...

10:04.400 --> 10:08.120
Casper the Gay, Eddie the Gay, whatever, you're gay.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.120
Gay the Gay.

10:09.120 --> 10:13.360
Gay the gayest gay that ever gayed with his gay blade on the Zorro gay game.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.360
I can really...

10:14.360 --> 10:15.360
DT said I just won the internet.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.360
Except for Rob.

10:16.360 --> 10:21.800
Dude, when I ever eat breakfast, I poop out the internet, so don't worry about that.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.680
Have you mastered your gay blade, Eddie?

10:25.680 --> 10:29.160
Rob has the gay blade, and he bought it at Disneyland.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.040
Let's go back to video game news, shall we?

10:32.040 --> 10:33.040
Before we lose.

10:33.040 --> 10:37.160
Tonight, it's how many subscribers can we lose?

10:37.160 --> 10:40.160
Speaking of gay, I'm sorry.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.160
Transformers.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.200
How about some news about Transformers?

10:43.200 --> 10:48.280
There's a Transformers game being put out by Activision on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PS2,

10:48.280 --> 10:49.280
and PC.

10:49.280 --> 10:54.720
That's a lot of P's trying to say that five times fast.

10:54.720 --> 11:02.120
We have the PSP and DS versions that are going to be handled by Savage and Vicarious Visions.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.200
Wait, they're going to be handled by a Savage?

11:04.200 --> 11:07.880
The Transformers are being handled, you know.

11:07.880 --> 11:14.280
I figured if we could have a transforming tape deck, we could have a vibrator.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.280
And that will get me to another topic today, because I actually looked at the Transformers

11:17.280 --> 11:19.480
movie poster today and about cried.

11:19.480 --> 11:23.120
Yeah, it's actually being handled by Randy Macho Man Savage.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.120
Oh, yeah!

11:24.120 --> 11:26.120
Snap into a Transformer!

11:26.120 --> 11:28.800
That was awful!

11:28.800 --> 11:31.920
I love that he plays Space Ghost Grandpa.

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
Oh, yeah!

11:32.920 --> 11:34.920
On Space Ghost Ghost to Ghost.

11:34.920 --> 11:38.560
I will actually be doing the rest of the night as Randy Macho Man Savage.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.560
Oh, yeah!

11:39.560 --> 11:41.560
You can't know, Rob.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.560
Oh, no!

11:42.560 --> 11:43.560
Oh, no!

11:43.560 --> 11:44.560
Naughty, naughty, Kool-Aid!

11:44.560 --> 11:47.640
So when are you going to start, Rob?

11:47.640 --> 11:49.640
Because that's awful.

11:49.640 --> 11:53.600
So how about that Transformers game, huh?

11:53.600 --> 11:54.600
Sure.

11:54.600 --> 11:59.800
The Transformers game, you'll be able to either play as an Autobot or Decepticon, and you

11:59.800 --> 12:05.880
would have to master each character's weapon, moves, transformations, and you'd have to

12:05.880 --> 12:10.520
be able to switch between the, of course, vehicle and robot mode.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.920
You can tear up the world around you, you can smash shit, and you can blow shit up.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.320
And that makes it an awesome game already.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.320
Woo-hoo!

12:18.320 --> 12:26.720
Traveler's Tales, by the way, I believe that they are the ones releasing it.

12:26.720 --> 12:31.260
They also had that Lego Star Wars game.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.680
And also had that stupid Bionicle game, as well.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.200
But the Lego Star Wars game was fun.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.200
Perhaps Lego Transformers?

12:37.200 --> 12:38.200
No?

12:38.200 --> 12:45.960
I don't know, but I freaking saw that poster today and wanted to cry again, but I am going

12:45.960 --> 12:47.960
to see Ghostwriter.

12:47.960 --> 12:58.040
Anyways, so the PSP, they just updated the firmware from 3.10 to 3.11, adding brand new

12:58.040 --> 13:06.080
functionality like a fix to some of the R-Type games and a reset button for the emulator.

13:06.080 --> 13:12.340
And well, as you might have guessed, as soon as they got it released out there to the world,

13:12.340 --> 13:17.980
it was cracked and broken apart, and yeah, yet another firmware that's been released

13:17.980 --> 13:21.240
by Sony and cracked the same day.

13:21.240 --> 13:27.400
So hooray, your attempts at foiling homebrew have failed yet again.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.200
I don't even care.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.960
Did you say that this is version 3.1.1?

13:31.960 --> 13:32.960
3.1.1.

13:32.960 --> 13:49.920
Someone cracked our system, down, down, they took it down, down, down, down, sorry.

13:49.920 --> 13:56.940
You know what, it's one of those shows, this is 3.1.1, the last three reviews that we've

13:56.940 --> 13:58.900
had on the station.

13:58.900 --> 14:04.000
This is the show we're submitting to the Podcast Emmys, by the way, just so you know.

14:04.000 --> 14:12.080
Vote for us on Digg and Podcast Allie, and tell them you loved episode 219.

14:12.080 --> 14:20.400
Anyhow, Will Wheaton, who can save a show, but who doesn't love Will Wheaton?

14:20.400 --> 14:22.640
Oh my God, Will Wheaton is awesome.

14:22.640 --> 14:28.440
Will Wheaton blogged this week on suicidegirls.com, and he was blogging about the arcades.

14:28.440 --> 14:32.680
I urge you to check this out, it was one of those reminiscing posts, he's talking about

14:32.680 --> 14:37.280
how he loves the arcades, and he loved the arcades back in the 80s, and he asked himself,

14:37.280 --> 14:39.320
what happens to the arcades?

14:39.320 --> 14:43.380
And he talks about, well, he thinks that because of PC gaming, and now he can spend 40 bucks

14:43.380 --> 14:46.280
to play a game at home, why would you spend a dollar on a game now?

14:46.280 --> 14:50.760
But what I thought was most interesting about this is his perspective on what should they

14:50.760 --> 14:51.760
do?

14:51.760 --> 14:56.240
And he thought in the last paragraph of his statement here, he thinks that some billionaire

14:56.240 --> 15:02.120
should come out and open a chain of classic 1980 videos arcades, complete with the Journey

15:02.120 --> 15:07.840
game and Rush on the Jukebox, more reasons why I love Will Wheaton, by the way, love

15:07.840 --> 15:13.480
him, and that you get five tokens for a dollar, and he says, why not?

15:13.480 --> 15:19.000
You had a resurgence of 50s diners in the 80s, so why not a resurgence of classic 80s

15:19.000 --> 15:20.160
arcades in the new millennium?

15:20.160 --> 15:21.160
What do you think?

15:21.160 --> 15:25.360
If they opened up a classic 80s arcade, would you go and would you patronize it?

15:25.360 --> 15:28.000
Yeah, or I could play MAME in my garage.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.280
Well, if they had the Journey game, I wouldn't.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.120
I would be camped out in front of the machine all day.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.120
I would have the high score.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.480
No, the Journey game is awesome.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.600
The Journey game is awesome.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.020
But you know what?

15:40.020 --> 15:43.160
You know where you get to play that is a classic gaming expo?

15:43.160 --> 15:45.080
They need to have like food there too, though.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.720
It would have to be like old school Chuck E. Cheese, you know, back there.

15:47.720 --> 15:50.280
Isn't that kind of what Dave & Buster's is, though?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
Sort of, yeah.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.280
Yeah.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.480
But Dave & Buster's is way damn expensive.

15:53.480 --> 15:57.040
I mean, they have just way too many ticket games there that cost way too much to win

15:57.040 --> 16:02.000
prizes that are, you know, okay, more expensive, but still, they have to spend more money.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
So I don't know.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Hold on.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.160
I have to set the mood here a little bit.

16:06.160 --> 16:16.280
Oh, yeah, this shit takes me back to the days of Asteroids and Ms. Pac-Man.

16:16.280 --> 16:20.640
Can you imagine walking into an arcade and you got Journey blasting on the...

16:20.640 --> 16:24.800
Man, this takes me back.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.800
You love this song.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.800
You know it.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.200
You just don't want to admit it, right, Princess?

16:30.200 --> 16:34.120
Anyhow, well, we've welcomed Wil Wheaton's opinion onto the program.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.400
How about your opinion?

16:35.400 --> 16:40.740
You guys send us emails every week to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and last week we

16:40.740 --> 16:44.360
complained we didn't get enough emails, so I think we actually got quite a few more emails

16:44.360 --> 16:47.060
this week, so we're very proud of the listeners.

16:47.060 --> 16:49.880
We hope we get more next week, so mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.080
You hope we get more.

16:51.080 --> 16:55.880
Let's get Dark Sakura to open up the mailbag and read some emails.

16:55.880 --> 17:05.080
Email, email, email, checking the email.

17:05.080 --> 17:09.360
First one comes from Apollo-chan saying, hey there, Dark Sakura.

17:09.360 --> 17:10.360
Oh, it's to me.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.360
Wow.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.360
I hope all is well with you and the rest of the crew.

17:13.360 --> 17:17.280
I was just curious if you or any of the other members of the OLR crew happen to have a Facebook

17:17.280 --> 17:18.480
account.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.420
If you are not familiar with Facebook, think MySpace, except less tacky and more respectable

17:22.420 --> 17:23.420
atmosphere.

17:23.420 --> 17:27.560
It began as a university-only networking site, but now it's open to everyone.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.280
If you all are not members, I would like to suggest that you at least give it a look.

17:31.280 --> 17:35.720
Also, there's an OLR Facebook group called Orange Dodge Radio Fans, the OLR me, that

17:35.720 --> 17:39.120
I started a while ago, and I just thought it might be good to let you all know in case

17:39.120 --> 17:40.240
you weren't aware.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.920
That way, you could better promote it.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.120
Just another vessel for spreading the OLR gospel.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.940
Love, love, love the show.

17:45.940 --> 17:49.800
You all make me amazingly happy, so keep up the good work and have a great week, Apollo.

17:49.800 --> 17:53.960
PS, I'm sure you all will be talking about the 2DX testing in Illinois on next week's

17:53.960 --> 17:54.960
show.

17:54.960 --> 17:55.960
Isn't that super exciting?

17:55.960 --> 17:56.960
There you go.

17:56.960 --> 18:03.800
You listen to part A. I'm excited, but I don't think it's going to catch, but we'll see.

18:03.800 --> 18:04.800
It's better than nothing.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.860
Well, I signed up for a Facebook account just for this, and I'd heard about Facebook before

18:08.860 --> 18:13.960
because I have friends that are still in college, like one of my really good friends, his sister.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.920
We're all on Facebook at the college there.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.920
She goes to Vassar, and every single student there, I think, has a Facebook account.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.680
Isn't that like a textile college?

18:21.680 --> 18:24.080
No, no, no, no.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.160
I think it was a woman's college back in the day, but it's a very pretty campus, though,

18:27.160 --> 18:28.160
but that's regardless.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.440
Does anyone from Vassar listen to the program?

18:29.440 --> 18:30.440
You should send me an email.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.200
I actually was there a couple months ago.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.280
Anyway, that's not the point.

18:33.280 --> 18:38.360
The point is we have an Orange Lounge Radio community on Facebook, and you can find it

18:38.360 --> 18:42.000
by searching for Orange Lounge Radio, and I actually signed up for a Facebook account,

18:42.000 --> 18:46.960
and yeah, it's kind of like Myspace without the page customization and all that weird

18:46.960 --> 18:51.560
stuff that brings Myspace to a strange level, but what I think is really interesting is

18:51.560 --> 18:53.680
that you update people of your status.

18:53.680 --> 18:57.620
So for those of you that remember Jonas, aka Explicit, that came onto this program, he's

18:57.620 --> 19:02.720
on my friend's page, and it told me last night, Jonas is out at a party, and I was like, wow,

19:02.720 --> 19:05.040
that's amazing that the internet tells me these things.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.960
Amazing what the internet has accomplished.

19:07.960 --> 19:12.200
I think it's awesome that somebody else created this community and that people were already

19:12.200 --> 19:13.880
joining it before we even got an email on it.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.280
So big hug and kisses to you guys out there.

19:16.280 --> 19:21.560
Well, our next email actually comes from, let me see, from Stacy.

19:21.560 --> 19:26.320
It says, hello, I've been listening to the Orange Lounge station for about a week now,

19:26.320 --> 19:27.960
and I have a question about the playlist.

19:27.960 --> 19:32.000
It seems that the majority of the songs are from DDR or BeatMania or from other similar

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
games.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.140
There were very few, very, very few songs that weren't dance, eurobeat, et cetera.

19:36.140 --> 19:39.340
Why is it advertised as a station dedicated to video games when there's no bias toward

19:39.340 --> 19:40.880
dance type games?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.280
From what I read on the site, I understand that it started out as being a tribute to

19:43.280 --> 19:46.800
those kinds of games, but now, aside from the shows, there's very little to distinguish

19:46.800 --> 19:49.200
it from the typical dance station.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.660
So if this sounds like an attack, it really is, and I'm generally curious about this.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.000
I think we just haven't filtered out a lot of the old stuff.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Yeah.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.180
That's the majority of the stuff, because they were all there before.

19:58.180 --> 20:02.620
To be honest, well, we did do a pretty big reshuffle when we went to MP3 Pro about a

20:02.620 --> 20:08.520
year and a half ago, but I think that's what's been high rated, and there are other places

20:08.520 --> 20:13.120
out there where you can hear just regular gaming music, but I find that a lot of the

20:13.120 --> 20:18.700
orchestral gaming music can kind of be like, not that it's bad or anything, but without

20:18.700 --> 20:21.960
the game there, it doesn't make for the most entertaining radio.

20:21.960 --> 20:26.800
We try to keep the music that's in our rotation upbeat a little more, but certainly it could

20:26.800 --> 20:32.160
use some help in getting the music buffed up with some other picks that are very upbeat.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.020
So certainly we welcome your suggestions on music we could add to the stream.

20:35.020 --> 20:38.520
The really bizarre stuff was from me, by the way.

20:38.520 --> 20:43.060
Keep in mind, though, we still feel justified in calling ourselves radio dedicated to video

20:43.060 --> 20:47.400
gaming because of the live shows that we do, which is really the focus of the station.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.640
I have to be honest, even though the 24-7 music program is what's there most of the

20:50.640 --> 20:53.280
time, it's actually the lowest on our priority chain.

20:53.280 --> 20:57.540
We're more into bringing you guys the live interactive stuff than just a bunch of MP3s

20:57.540 --> 20:59.080
on shuffle, to be honest.

20:59.080 --> 21:03.520
So we're glad that somebody is listening to live stream, though, and caring, and certainly

21:03.520 --> 21:09.960
we'll take another look at what's in rotation and maybe try to liven it up a little.

21:09.960 --> 21:20.480
Next email comes from XenionELDDR, this is my first time writing, and first of all, I

21:20.480 --> 21:23.480
want to say that your show is awesome and continue the good work.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.480
Smiley.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.120
Well, the reason I am writing is because I have a question on a certain comedy game that

21:28.120 --> 21:33.680
has piqued my interest as of late, as learning if Konami's Oz will ever be released in America.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.880
I know that the game is about a year and a half old, but I've seen YouTube video with

21:36.880 --> 21:41.520
an English dubbed French, I think text version of the game, and I think that they would try

21:41.520 --> 21:45.080
to put English text in the game because I, for one, would wait until they were done putting

21:45.080 --> 21:47.200
the text in and buy it with no questions asked.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.440
I also ask this because I'm considering buying the import version if it does not make it

21:51.440 --> 21:56.000
overseas, or if there is a way to try to persuade Konami of America to releasing it over here,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.400
because I need to buy an import PS2, and if not, as you can really see, I want this game,

21:59.400 --> 22:04.720
but not only because this is a run-on sentence that's never-ending, this game, but I've always

22:04.720 --> 22:08.640
wanted to try out popin' music and other 2DX games besides the English one I own.

22:08.640 --> 22:09.640
Period!

22:09.640 --> 22:10.640
Thank you.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.120
Hopefully you can help me out, and thank you for taking the time to read this email.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.320
Again, your show rules.

22:15.320 --> 22:16.320
Thank you.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.840
That was a really big, freaking long run-up.

22:17.840 --> 22:21.720
I'm not trying to poke or anything, it's just like...

22:21.720 --> 22:22.720
That's why no one emails us.

22:22.720 --> 22:23.720
Punctuation!

22:23.720 --> 22:25.720
Tell me when I can take a breath.

22:25.720 --> 22:29.800
Pause on PlayStation 2 is not going to come out in this country, and I don't think there's

22:29.800 --> 22:33.760
a lot that can be done at this point because PlayStation 2 is slowly being phased out,

22:33.760 --> 22:37.440
so unfortunately you're probably going to have to import that one.

22:37.440 --> 22:41.480
But I don't think it's ever a bad idea to certainly petition the game makers for the

22:41.480 --> 22:43.360
games you want to see.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.520
Send emails, let them know.

22:46.520 --> 22:52.100
I know a company like Konami, they're somewhat out there reading some of the stuff out there

22:52.100 --> 22:55.520
on the internet, so I'm not saying you should go on a board and bitch about it, but send

22:55.520 --> 22:56.520
emails.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.520
They do care.

22:57.520 --> 23:00.720
And that goes with any gaming company, not just Konami, but any gaming company.

23:00.720 --> 23:05.320
Let them know, you want to see it here.

23:05.320 --> 23:12.460
The next one is actually a link that was sent to us by JeremyTodd1, which I think is actually

23:12.460 --> 23:15.920
pretty cool.

23:15.920 --> 23:22.320
Apparently the folks at Xbox Magazine used Miis for the staff picture, so they were doing

23:22.320 --> 23:27.080
their nod toward Nintendo, and it actually is...

23:27.080 --> 23:36.880
If you go to gonintendo.com slash wp-content slash photos slash miioxm.jpg, you can see

23:36.880 --> 23:37.880
the image.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.280
It's been the last two issues.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.680
Unfortunately I get the magazine.

23:42.680 --> 23:46.840
Originally I signed up for it to get demos because I was like, ooh, ooh, you know, time

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
shift demo.

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
That's not out yet.

23:48.840 --> 23:54.920
Unfortunately the last few demos have all been crap, so that kind of sucks.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.360
Well why the sudden appearance of Miis in the magazine?

23:57.360 --> 24:03.560
Is that just furthering that odd affection that Microsoft has for Nintendo right now,

24:03.560 --> 24:04.560
like all these subtle comments?

24:04.560 --> 24:07.200
They want to recreate pictures of themselves.

24:07.200 --> 24:12.520
But using your competitors, because essentially Nintendo is still their competitor, because

24:12.520 --> 24:16.840
even though Microsoft might have somehow embraced this Wii 16, I mean, it's odd because you

24:16.840 --> 24:22.500
see Major Nelson says nice things about the Wii in his blog, Trixie, I've read her thing

24:22.500 --> 24:26.400
on xbox.com, she said nice things about the Wii at one point, and it's kind of like Microsoft

24:26.400 --> 24:30.160
kind of has this professional respect for the Wii, but that doesn't seem to be reciprocated

24:30.160 --> 24:31.160
by Nintendo.

24:31.160 --> 24:36.400
I mean, there might be a respect, but Reggie has flat out said, don't buy a 360, buy more

24:36.400 --> 24:38.960
Wii games, essentially, in so many words.

24:38.960 --> 24:44.360
So it's just kind of interesting that Microsoft keeps handing these olive branches over to

24:44.360 --> 24:49.440
Nintendo, like, hey, let's fight Sony together.

24:49.440 --> 24:52.440
Weird.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.960
I think that maybe they're just trying to screw with the consumer's heads.

24:55.960 --> 25:00.240
GS68 in our chat room says, come on, Reggie, make love, not war.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.840
So how about the next email, huh?

25:02.840 --> 25:03.840
How about it?

25:03.840 --> 25:09.880
Dear OLR, Hi guys, DDR Dollar Bill here, and probably changing my name in the future, long

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
story.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.280
In spirit, as long as I'm not going to be in the chat room on Sunday, my crazy self

25:14.280 --> 25:18.400
is in Vegas doing some partying with my family and probably a few hundred crazies.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.400
Lucky.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.360
But I do have one thing I'd like to ask.

25:21.360 --> 25:26.240
While I was making my pre-reserve for DDR Universe, I had a glance at the future release's

25:26.240 --> 25:27.240
date list.

25:27.240 --> 25:31.240
Even took home a copy, it helps knowing friends at GameStop, and sell Guitar Hero 2.

25:31.240 --> 25:35.000
Now, I know this is most likely will be a port of the PS2, but we had a discussion about

25:35.000 --> 25:38.400
the rumor of Guitar Hero having a future release of all 80 songs.

25:38.400 --> 25:43.000
True or not, it did get me thinking, would having music games concentrate on a certain

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
genre make them more appealing to the mass market?

25:46.000 --> 25:50.560
Would it also make it more interesting for those already addicted to the games themselves?

25:50.560 --> 25:51.800
It's just my thought of the week.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.800
Anyhoo, there's my $2 to the show, I hope you all have fun, and it goes to the chat

25:55.800 --> 25:56.920
room buddies as well.

25:56.920 --> 25:57.920
DDR Dollar Bill.

25:57.920 --> 25:58.920
Nope.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.920
It won't make them appeal the more people know why.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.920
Seems to be working for Karaoke Revolution.

26:02.920 --> 26:03.920
Country?

26:03.920 --> 26:04.920
No, it sucked.

26:04.920 --> 26:05.920
I thought it was pretty cool.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.200
I played it, and I don't even like country music.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.200
It was awful.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.200
I liked it.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.440
It was a good game.

26:11.440 --> 26:17.280
Then again, I have a huge distaste for country music.

26:17.280 --> 26:22.080
I want to say a response to the Guitar Hero 80 songs thing.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.120
Rumor and emphasis on rumor is that some of the downloadable packs will have some of the

26:26.120 --> 26:32.040
Guitar Hero 1 songs in them, but I bet you 10 to 1 you would have an easier time seeing

26:32.040 --> 26:37.160
the indie label stuff crossover than you would the major label stuff crossover, because they're

26:37.160 --> 26:39.080
going to have to re-license and all that stuff.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.920
I think they would have to.

26:40.920 --> 26:45.360
So you'd have a better chance of seeing some of the harmonics house bands, or freeze pop,

26:45.360 --> 26:49.240
things like that coming over from Guitar Hero 1 than some of the licensed tracks, but that's

26:49.240 --> 26:50.240
not a no.

26:50.240 --> 26:56.840
That's just a rumor says right now.

26:56.840 --> 27:03.280
Moving on, hey OLR people, particularly Rob.

27:03.280 --> 27:07.480
So I bought an Xbox 360 some months ago, and my roommate bought a Wii at launch.

27:07.480 --> 27:12.000
We love many of the games on the systems, but I think that it's time I bought myself

27:12.000 --> 27:16.800
a good gaming PC to play some games that I've never been able to play before, and I have

27:16.800 --> 27:18.920
decided to go with Commodore 64.

27:18.920 --> 27:19.920
You win the internet.

27:19.920 --> 27:20.920
Who is this?

27:20.920 --> 27:21.920
You win the internet.

27:21.920 --> 27:22.920
You'll see.

27:22.920 --> 27:23.920
All right.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.480
I understand you know a bit about that particular machine, and I was wondering if there's anything

27:26.480 --> 27:29.640
you recommend I look for when going out and buying one.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.640
Kickstart.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.640
Make sure it works.

27:31.640 --> 27:35.800
Are there particular cables and things that I need to make sure I get, or particular accessories

27:35.800 --> 27:37.920
or games that you recommend I look for?

27:37.920 --> 27:41.620
I was thinking about how all of the current next gen consoles offer extra features like

27:41.620 --> 27:47.140
media playback and use in weather channels, and I realized that the C64 can be used as

27:47.140 --> 27:51.320
a musical instrument, so it's a good contender for my next game platform.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.320
Thanks in advance.

27:52.320 --> 27:55.680
Regards, Warrior Bob.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.000
You rock, Warrior Bob.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.400
You can hook up a Commodore 64 to a television.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.960
I'm trying to remember, it's been so long, and I had a monitor.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.600
I never hooked up the Commodore 64 to a TV, but I seem to remember the hookups were very

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
similar.

28:07.600 --> 28:11.960
The video component was almost the exact same between the two, so you might need some type

28:11.960 --> 28:15.840
of special converter, though, to actually hook it up to a television.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.080
Did you guys have Commodore 64s?

28:17.080 --> 28:18.080
I thought Rice Princess did.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.080
No, but you know who did?

28:19.080 --> 28:20.080
Who?

28:20.080 --> 28:21.080
Captain Kirk.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.080
Look, Rice Princess.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.080
Shut up.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.080
You had a Commodore 64, right?

28:24.080 --> 28:25.080
Yeah.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.080
Did you have it hooked up to a TV?

28:26.080 --> 28:27.080
No.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.080
Do you remember if there were special cables?

28:28.080 --> 28:29.080
I can't remember.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.080
I can't remember either.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.080
I know.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.080
It's been so long.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.080
What about games that you remember on the Commodore 64?

28:33.080 --> 28:34.080
Impossible Mission.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.080
Dude, Impossible Mission was awesome.

28:35.080 --> 28:41.200
What was that game, The Last Ninja, or Revenge of the Ninja, or something that game was?

28:41.200 --> 28:42.200
That game was awesome.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.200
Revenge of the Ninja was on the Game Boy.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.200
I think it's The Last Ninja, is what it was called.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.800
Revenge of the Ninja was on the Sega CD.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.880
It was a cinematic game.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.400
Lazy Jones was a fun game, because that was a bunch of mini games.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.400
Load Runner.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.400
It's better than Fusion Frenzy.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.400
I can't remember.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.640
We had nations on Mars or something, like they were the Mars Zoggers.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.920
Pinball Construction Set.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.320
That game's awesome, too.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.320
Oh, shut up!

29:00.320 --> 29:01.320
It's awesome!

29:01.320 --> 29:06.040
It does not require a special monitor, it can be plugged into a TV.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.400
That's what it says on Wikipedia.

29:08.400 --> 29:12.760
I was going to say, though, Kickstart.

29:12.760 --> 29:15.520
That is the only game I ever played on the Commodore 64.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.640
Is that the one with the button, and you kick with the little clown, and you kick the balloons

29:18.640 --> 29:19.640
around the screen?

29:19.640 --> 29:20.640
No, it's a dirt bike racing game.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.640
Oh, I'm thinking of a different game.

29:21.640 --> 29:22.640
It's very similar to Excitebike.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.640
Kickman!

29:23.640 --> 29:24.640
Never mind.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.800
Excite, it is very similar to Excitebike, so Kickstart.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.800
Gotta get that game.

29:28.800 --> 29:29.800
Winter Games.

29:29.800 --> 29:30.800
Winter Games.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.800
Bard's Tale.

29:31.800 --> 29:36.280
Oh, GameTap has a lot of Commodore 64 games on it, so if you want to try some out, GameTap

29:36.280 --> 29:37.280
has a bunch.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.680
I'm trying to find the game that I used to play all the time.

29:39.680 --> 29:43.060
I thought it was Bard's Tale, but I tried to look it up, and all the ones that I came

29:43.060 --> 29:45.240
up with did not look anything.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.240
What was that game?

29:46.240 --> 29:47.240
The Seven Scrolls, or whatever that game was?

29:47.240 --> 29:51.160
No, all I remember is a miasmal cur from the game.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.400
That's the only thing that sticks out in my mind.

29:53.400 --> 29:58.520
Well good luck with your Commodore 64 adventures, and you have to try GEOS at some point.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.080
GEOS?

30:00.080 --> 30:02.320
See the Commodore 64 as a Mac.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.320
Oh, God.

30:03.320 --> 30:06.400
Dude, the Commodore 64 was awesome.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.680
I love the Commodore 64.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.600
There's a picture on Wikipedia.

30:10.600 --> 30:15.000
Just about any arcade game that was out in the early 80s had a port on the Commodore

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
64.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
You name it.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.520
Donkey Kong, Kongo Bongo, whatever, it's out there.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.120
And Captain Kirk did have one.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.920
There was a Star Trek game on the Commodore 64, you smartass.

30:23.920 --> 30:27.760
Yeah, he had one in Star Trek II.

30:27.760 --> 30:31.040
Let us know what Commodore 64... In fact, I would urge all our listeners at some point

30:31.040 --> 30:35.840
this week, because there is a website where you can play Commodore 64 games.

30:35.840 --> 30:39.840
I can't remember what the hell it was.

30:39.840 --> 30:40.840
Maybe somebody in chat remembers.

30:40.840 --> 30:45.440
There was some site that had nothing but Java Commodore 64 games, so you can play a ton

30:45.440 --> 30:47.880
of them online.

30:47.880 --> 30:53.400
I urge everyone to play one Commodore 64 game this week, and check out the roots of PC gaming.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.400
Definitely make it an impossible mission.

30:55.400 --> 31:01.240
Okay, so speaking of the Commodore 64, who had a TI-85?

31:01.240 --> 31:04.720
I know what they are, but I didn't have one, because we had a Commodore 64.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.720
They were better.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.720
I had a Coleco, I had an Atom.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.600
Anyway... And if you had an Apple II, I'm sorry.

31:10.600 --> 31:15.720
We had one at my school, and I played a lot of Kix, and that was all I cared about.

31:15.720 --> 31:19.320
Somebody in our chat room, Kamara, says Lemon64.com.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.320
I've never seen this site.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.800
This isn't the same site I use, but it looks like this will work.

31:22.800 --> 31:23.800
I think you can do this.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.800
I'm going to try it.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:26.640 --> 31:29.160
This comes from Cutie Honey.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.320
I just got two things to say this time.

31:31.320 --> 31:34.920
I recall a comment at the end of the Sunday show where Rob said that the show needs more

31:34.920 --> 31:35.920
gay people.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.000
Well, I guess you can count me as the O.O.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Army's first bisexual.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Pleasure to meet you guys.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.360
I'm sorry you've been... You're beaten to that from show one.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.680
Sorry.

31:45.680 --> 31:51.240
Second, on a completely different note, two weeks ago you guys started a discussion about

31:51.240 --> 31:54.000
games that have too many sequels and remakes.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.440
In chat, I brought up the fact that DDR had many games, and suddenly a ton of people went

31:59.440 --> 32:00.440
crazy.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.720
A fun kind of crazy, mind you.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.720
Wait, wait, wait.

32:02.720 --> 32:03.720
Bisexual male or female?

32:03.720 --> 32:04.720
Male.

32:04.720 --> 32:05.720
Over 18?

32:05.720 --> 32:06.720
Single?

32:06.720 --> 32:07.720
Did he attach a picture?

32:07.720 --> 32:08.720
No.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.720
Just kidding.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.720
I'm kidding.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.720
I'm kidding.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.720
Rob, can I finish the email?

32:12.720 --> 32:13.720
I'm sorry.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.720
It's Valentine's Day, and I'm single.

32:14.720 --> 32:15.720
Rob, it's not Valentine's Day.

32:15.720 --> 32:16.720
Do you know what I'm doing on Valentine's Day?

32:16.720 --> 32:17.720
Crochets.

32:17.720 --> 32:27.200
Having my neck adjusted and going to school.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.200
Fun.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.200
How romantic.

32:29.200 --> 32:32.200
Anyway, can I finish reading the email, please?

32:32.200 --> 32:33.200
Yes, you may.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.200
Okay.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.200
Where was I?

32:35.200 --> 32:36.200
Oh, yeah.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.160
So, here's the burning question.

32:38.160 --> 32:42.200
Do you think Konami beats a dead horse by releasing several Bimani games each year with

32:42.200 --> 32:43.640
only different song lists?

32:43.640 --> 32:44.640
Excuse me.

32:44.640 --> 32:47.360
I blame the orange soda for that.

32:47.360 --> 32:51.720
Although I'm not helping the situation by buying every PS2 DDR game that gets released,

32:51.720 --> 32:56.560
it's kind of annoying to see some new features like battle mode added when you have to ask

32:56.560 --> 32:59.120
yourself why didn't they add it last year.

32:59.120 --> 33:05.160
The cheap rational bastard in me would rather like a DDR game that has over 150 songs in

33:05.160 --> 33:10.360
it with more modes graphical upgrades in 2008 than a 70-song game with two new dancing avatars

33:10.360 --> 33:11.360
later this year.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.120
Anyway, thanks for your time.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.440
I spent an hour going to school on public transportation, and your podcast keeps it

33:16.440 --> 33:17.680
from being boring.

33:17.680 --> 33:20.280
Keep up the good work, cutie honey.

33:20.280 --> 33:21.840
All right.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.640
Wait, no honey fresh?

33:23.640 --> 33:24.640
No?

33:24.640 --> 33:28.880
I thought that was going to be all that she was planning for.

33:28.880 --> 33:33.080
You know, I think the Bimani games coming out very similar every year with different

33:33.080 --> 33:34.080
song lists.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.080
Keep in mind there's new modes.

33:35.080 --> 33:38.020
Usually, Konami tries to throw something new in it every time, whether it be the single

33:38.020 --> 33:41.520
player mission master or the hands and feet or whatever new thing they did.

33:41.520 --> 33:47.280
But I would say it's no different than the Madden 06, 07, 08 games that come out.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.560
And some people don't get that just like some people don't get the DDR games that come out

33:50.560 --> 33:51.560
every year.

33:51.560 --> 33:55.360
I think it's just kind of if you're into that, then you kind of accept that as part of what

33:55.360 --> 33:57.320
the games go through each year with the change.

33:57.320 --> 34:01.160
So that's what I say.

34:01.160 --> 34:05.720
With the new songs come new step charts and new challenges, you know, I don't know.

34:05.720 --> 34:10.220
But see, from the other perspective, ask somebody who doesn't play DDR as much as I do and they

34:10.220 --> 34:11.960
probably think, it's stupid.

34:11.960 --> 34:12.960
It's the same game every time.

34:12.960 --> 34:16.440
And you know, that's just, you know, that's how some of us, what some of us say about

34:16.440 --> 34:19.040
Madden is that, you know, it's roster update 2007.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.160
Well, you know, we don't really play those games, so we don't understand.

34:22.160 --> 34:25.320
So I try not to say that if I do, it's in jest.

34:25.320 --> 34:29.840
It actually in the beginning with DDR, it used to have a lot of significant changes

34:29.840 --> 34:30.840
with each one.

34:30.840 --> 34:38.120
You know, the first I remember, you know, with Fifth Mix, you had the actual tempo freezes,

34:38.120 --> 34:40.520
which was like, you know, when you first played, you're like, what the fuck?

34:40.520 --> 34:42.800
You know, the song stopped.

34:42.800 --> 34:43.800
Someone broke the machine.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.920
Oh, it started up again.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.240
So that was kind of neat.

34:47.240 --> 34:54.420
And then, of course, you had tempo changes, you know, and Fourth Mix and stuff like that.

34:54.420 --> 35:01.080
And then, you know, with Max, you had freeze notes, which, you know, were definitely different

35:01.080 --> 35:02.080
at the time.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.080
I don't know.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.280
So they keep, they try to keep it pretty fresh with each one.

35:05.280 --> 35:09.080
But you know, after a while, they do start looking very similar.

35:09.080 --> 35:12.440
Dude, I got a friend request on Facebook.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.440
The show rocks.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.600
Is it a hot gay man?

35:16.600 --> 35:17.600
No, it's not.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.600
No hot gay man?

35:18.600 --> 35:19.600
Oh.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.600
No.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.600
That was the last email, so.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
Straight man.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.600
Yep.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.600
But a cool one.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.600
Yeah.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.600
What's your Facebook address, Rob?

35:26.600 --> 35:27.600
You don't have addresses on Facebook.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.600
You have to look me up by name.

35:28.600 --> 35:29.600
But I use my stage name, Rob Roberts.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.600
Really?

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
So it's easy to find me on Facebook.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.600
That's cool.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.600
Jamie, you should get a Facebook, too.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.600
That's kind of fun.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.600
That's okay.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.600
I have.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.600
Oh, I got another one, too.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.600
Look at this.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
Oh, I'm popular.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.600
Yay.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.600
All right.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.080
Speaking of popular, you know what game is popular out there?

35:45.080 --> 35:46.080
Gears of War.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.880
I mean, everyone's got a big heart on over Gears of War.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.040
Except for me, because I don't really like the game.

35:51.040 --> 35:59.280
But anyways, it did win eight awards at the 10th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

35:59.280 --> 36:02.840
And these aren't like achievement points, but you know, whatever.

36:02.840 --> 36:11.240
It did win a bunch of different awards, including Game of the Year, Best Console Game, Best

36:11.240 --> 36:21.260
Animation, let's see here, among some other ones here, Best Outstanding Character Performance

36:21.260 --> 36:31.560
of a Male, Best Online Gameplay, Best Visual Engineering, and Action Adventure Game of

36:31.560 --> 36:33.400
the Year.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.560
Surprise.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.040
You know, Gears of War wins more awards.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.040
What?

36:39.040 --> 36:46.320
No, I'm actually with Loki, I mean, eh, you know, I could care less.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.320
Why?

36:47.320 --> 36:49.160
Well, Gears of War is a phenomenal game.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.160
Blah, blah, blah.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.160
So is Halo, but that one sucks, too.

36:51.160 --> 36:52.160
That's what everybody on the internet says.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.160
It must be true.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.520
When Halo 3 comes out this year, and even if it isn't as good as Gears of War, and you

36:57.520 --> 37:03.040
know, it could be like half as good as Gears of War or whatever, people will still be giving

37:03.040 --> 37:08.720
this thing awards and getting a big boner over this game because it's Halo.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.720
I don't know.

37:09.720 --> 37:14.920
My Gears was okay, but I mean, just, I don't know, it didn't give me the boner it gave

37:14.920 --> 37:17.400
the rest of the internet, I guess.

37:17.400 --> 37:21.080
Anyhow, this might give a lot of sci-fi fans a boner, though.

37:21.080 --> 37:25.200
Eddie, get your hand away from me.

37:25.200 --> 37:35.360
According to the Hollywood Reporter, Universal MBC, which is part of Vivendi, they are working

37:35.360 --> 37:40.280
on a space combat game, it's like a sim game, set in the Battlestar Galactica universe,

37:40.280 --> 37:42.760
and I'm talking the new one, not the old one.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.560
Or Galaxy Bellactica.

37:44.560 --> 37:50.840
Digital download for PC and Xbox Live Arcade, and there's a tie-in, by the way, with Xbox

37:50.840 --> 37:56.080
because there's new Battlestar Galactica gamer picks and themes available for low amounts

37:56.080 --> 37:57.080
of Microsoft points.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.280
Are the characters going to cry their emo tears?

37:59.280 --> 38:01.200
Hey, Battlestar Galactica is a pretty good show.

38:01.200 --> 38:04.120
I don't know if you've ever actually watched it, it's actually pretty good.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.960
It's the Krylons, not the Cylons.

38:05.960 --> 38:06.960
Whatever.

38:06.960 --> 38:07.960
Stop being uneducated.

38:07.960 --> 38:12.320
It will be hard for Eddie, I'm kidding.

38:12.320 --> 38:15.300
I'm looking forward to seeing what this looks like on Xbox Live, I bet it's fun.

38:15.300 --> 38:19.480
I don't care about Xbox, but on PC it's going to be awesome.

38:19.480 --> 38:23.920
I have some news that people might care about, but I don't know, not really.

38:23.920 --> 38:28.840
But we have friends at Buena Vista Games, at least they've always been really, really

38:28.840 --> 38:33.200
great at E3 to work with because when Square says, you can't film that, they're like, here,

38:33.200 --> 38:36.320
let me play it while you film it.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.520
But they have renamed themselves.

38:39.520 --> 38:44.440
They are now called Disney Interactive Studios.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.400
They're dissed.

38:47.400 --> 38:51.160
So they're officially now making their Disney affiliation public.

38:51.160 --> 38:56.040
So when we see Kingdom Hearts and the Disney Interactive Studios, we get it.

38:56.040 --> 39:04.000
They're still doing non-Disney games, too, to every extent extra, which is one of them.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.760
But they are now officially Disney oriented.

39:08.760 --> 39:15.320
Just like Disney presents the M-rated dinosaur-hunting Turok coming out later this year.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.560
That should be interesting.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.560
Disney's Turok.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.440
I wonder if we'll have a theme ride based on that.

39:20.440 --> 39:24.840
Maybe we should have crossover because Disney owns ABC as well, so we should have crossover

39:24.840 --> 39:26.480
with the characters from Dinosaur.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.960
Not the mama, boo!

39:29.960 --> 39:30.960
Awesome.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.800
That would be awesome.

39:32.800 --> 39:38.280
I hope there's some TGIF fans out there that get my joke, or I'm going to look stupid as

39:38.280 --> 39:39.280
usual.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.280
Anyway.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.760
Let's give it up for 92, y'all!

39:43.760 --> 39:46.080
92 in the house!

39:46.080 --> 39:48.400
Well this might make some people happy.

39:48.400 --> 39:54.120
Square Enix confirms a brand new MMO coming to 360 and Vista, and possibly the PlayStation

39:54.120 --> 39:55.120
3.

39:55.120 --> 40:01.200
But whether it's going to be a sequel to Final Fantasy XI, maybe Final Fantasy XIV, huh?

40:01.200 --> 40:02.200
Huh?

40:02.200 --> 40:03.200
Again?

40:03.200 --> 40:04.200
Final Fantasy XI-II.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.560
11D blue.

40:05.560 --> 40:11.840
Or as some folks on the internet might say, Final Fantasy XI-II.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.120
Because remember how everybody said Final Fantasy X-II?

40:14.120 --> 40:19.640
We had this huge debate, and we actually emailed Square to have them settle the debate on whether

40:19.640 --> 40:21.360
it was called X-II or X-X-X.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.360
Forget it.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.360
It was funny.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.360
Uh, anyways.

40:24.360 --> 40:29.320
Rice Princess, you look very excited about the prospect of Final Fantasy XI-II or Final

40:29.320 --> 40:30.320
Fantasy XIV.

40:30.320 --> 40:34.920
I'm going to crap my pants in eager anticipation.

40:34.920 --> 40:36.600
What if it's Chrono Trigger Online?

40:36.600 --> 40:37.680
Fuck yeah, I'll play that!

40:37.680 --> 40:38.680
There you go!

40:38.680 --> 40:39.680
Hell yeah!

40:39.680 --> 40:41.680
That's where I'm really going to crap my pants.

40:41.680 --> 40:46.160
Ew, that's kind of gross.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.400
What if it's, like, Saga Frontier Online?

40:49.400 --> 40:50.680
Pass!

40:50.680 --> 40:53.040
I would be the only person playing it!

40:53.040 --> 40:54.040
Probably!

40:54.040 --> 40:55.040
Like, yes!

40:55.040 --> 40:57.040
I can farm all the gold.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.600
That's it.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.880
Okay, we can move on.

41:00.880 --> 41:05.160
I would play Final Fantasy XI-II, because as much crap as I get Final Fantasy XI now,

41:05.160 --> 41:08.800
I did waste two and a half years of my life on it, so there must have been something in

41:08.800 --> 41:10.520
that game I saw, and it was-

41:10.520 --> 41:11.520
Add it!

41:11.520 --> 41:12.520
Add it!

41:12.520 --> 41:20.280
It was a good game while it lasted, but I'm in full Final Fantasy XI recovery.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.280
That's gross.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.680
No, it was actually the people.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.280
The over-18 link shell people I had.

41:26.280 --> 41:30.280
I got a mighty big link shell here for you.

41:30.280 --> 41:34.360
Uni in our chat room is a self-confessed FFXI whore.

41:34.360 --> 41:35.360
There you go.

41:35.360 --> 41:38.680
I win, I spent four years, says Uni.

41:38.680 --> 41:39.680
I feel your pain.

41:39.680 --> 41:45.320
Have you ever spent real money on gold?

41:45.320 --> 41:48.640
That was the point when I knew I had to quit, when I was contemplating spending real money

41:48.640 --> 41:49.640
on gold.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.920
Rob, I'm sorry, that's just a little bit too-

41:52.920 --> 41:54.380
That's why I quit!

41:54.380 --> 41:56.400
Because I said, you know what, no, that's actually-

41:56.400 --> 41:57.680
Good for you, Rob!

41:57.680 --> 42:00.860
The other reason why I quit is because when I was sitting there for an hour, literally

42:00.860 --> 42:05.900
doing nothing, waiting for a party, I was like, I can't take this anymore.

42:05.900 --> 42:09.040
Waiting for a pretend party in the game?

42:09.040 --> 42:10.880
A panty party!

42:10.880 --> 42:11.880
That's awesome!

42:11.880 --> 42:13.840
Like your friends call you, what are you doing?

42:13.840 --> 42:15.680
Oh, waiting for a party to start?

42:15.680 --> 42:16.680
Sweet!

42:16.680 --> 42:18.280
Sweet, can I come over?

42:18.280 --> 42:19.280
Oh no, it's online.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.280
No, it's online.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.280
It's my online friend.

42:21.280 --> 42:22.280
We're gonna do a raid.

42:22.280 --> 42:26.040
Well, look, you do the same fucking thing in World of Warcraft, you have no room to

42:26.040 --> 42:27.040
talk.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.040
You know what I do?

42:28.040 --> 42:29.040
I jump around a tree for ten minutes-

42:29.040 --> 42:32.000
You tell Chuck Norris jokes in the barons while you wait for a party, that's the only

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
difference.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
No, I don't.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.520
I talk to all of my geeky friends on WoW while I'm jumping around a tree for half an hour,

42:38.520 --> 42:39.520
and I could be leveling.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.840
All right, anyhow.

42:40.840 --> 42:44.880
I was looking real quickly since you mentioned buying gold, and everyone's favorite site

42:44.880 --> 42:51.800
to hate, ige.com, they actually have options where you can purchase gold amounts up to

42:51.800 --> 42:55.280
fifty million, or at least Gil.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.280
Fifty million!

42:56.280 --> 43:01.640
Fifty million Gil, which is $1,563.50, who the fuck would spend that real money-

43:01.640 --> 43:07.300
Oh my god, oh no, that's lame, hey, wait a minute, whatever happened to our donation,

43:07.300 --> 43:08.680
we never spent it, huh?

43:08.680 --> 43:09.680
Just kidding.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.900
You know what, Rob, I am policing that, okay?

43:12.900 --> 43:15.080
And we're going to use it to send me to ASIN.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.240
No, yeah, then I'm policing that now.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
No.

43:18.240 --> 43:20.920
She'll be all like, back me donation, please.

43:20.920 --> 43:25.160
No, but will you please tell the back me wool story to our listeners?

43:25.160 --> 43:26.160
Why?

43:26.160 --> 43:27.160
It's lame.

43:27.160 --> 43:28.160
Because it's funny, no, just tell it.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.160
Tell it, it's a WoW story.

43:29.160 --> 43:32.900
Okay, so Brad was playing WoW, and some guy opened a trade window with him, and just gave

43:32.900 --> 43:38.320
him a bunch of wool, and then they just whispered to him, uh, tailoring?

43:38.320 --> 43:39.720
And he's like, no.

43:39.720 --> 43:43.320
And the guy's like, back me wool, please.

43:43.320 --> 43:47.800
And I don't know if Brad gave it back or not, but I thought it was funny, because it's a

43:47.800 --> 43:48.800
Chinese farmer.

43:48.800 --> 43:49.800
There's the inside joke!

43:49.800 --> 43:50.800
That's hilarious.

43:50.800 --> 43:56.320
But, you have to understand, now Irene is a hunter character, and her pet is, or no,

43:56.320 --> 44:01.720
the name of her character is back me wool, and the name of the pet is please.

44:01.720 --> 44:02.880
And nobody gets that.

44:02.880 --> 44:03.880
I do.

44:03.880 --> 44:07.080
And now our listeners will, if they ever play on Ravencrest.

44:07.080 --> 44:10.560
Yeah, don't play on Ravencrest.

44:10.560 --> 44:11.560
Oh, Har.

44:11.560 --> 44:12.560
Oh, wow.

44:12.560 --> 44:13.560
Trainwreck.

44:13.560 --> 44:14.560
Choo choo.

44:14.560 --> 44:19.040
Oh, I'm sorry, oh shit, it's my turn for a story, my bad.

44:19.040 --> 44:23.800
Yeah, Rob, I'm sitting here waiting on Rob, and you're telling Chuck Norris jokes in my

44:23.800 --> 44:24.800
eye lockup.

44:24.800 --> 44:28.680
I'm writing the show off tonight, I'm just writing it off, because this is not a good

44:28.680 --> 44:29.680
show.

44:29.680 --> 44:30.680
All right, no, I'm kidding.

44:30.680 --> 44:31.680
This show is off.

44:31.680 --> 44:32.680
This is amazing.

44:32.680 --> 44:33.680
Silly, silly.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.840
All right, here's another rule that is amazing.

44:36.840 --> 44:40.980
GameStop, you probably have read about this on your favorite blog, but I know some folks

44:40.980 --> 44:43.880
here in the studio have got to share their stuff on this.

44:43.880 --> 44:47.360
Now there's legislation out there, of course, looking to get stricter penalties on games.

44:47.360 --> 44:52.280
Well, GameStop released an internal memo this week, actually it was a conference call, and

44:52.280 --> 44:56.560
managers were told about a new rule, it's a new strict policy, this is it.

44:56.560 --> 45:04.220
If you sell a game, an M-rated game, to an underage customer, you get fired, and if you're

45:04.220 --> 45:10.320
the manager of that store, whether you were there or not, you get fired as well, for managing

45:10.320 --> 45:11.320
such a shitty employee.

45:11.320 --> 45:12.880
I'm so glad that Dan quit.

45:12.880 --> 45:15.480
GameStop, it doesn't work there, but what do you think of this policy?

45:15.480 --> 45:18.280
I think it's retarded, and I'm glad that Dan quit.

45:18.280 --> 45:19.280
Why?

45:19.280 --> 45:25.280
Well, the manager, I agree that the manager should have better trained the employee, but

45:25.280 --> 45:27.360
really it's the employee that should suffer for it.

45:27.360 --> 45:30.480
I think that the manager should be written up.

45:30.480 --> 45:31.480
I think that's acceptable.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.880
What are you going to do, make me work overtime?

45:34.880 --> 45:38.620
I'm just going to sell an M-rated game to a six-year-old, and then you're going to get

45:38.620 --> 45:39.620
your ass fired.

45:39.620 --> 45:41.160
I don't give a shit about this job.

45:41.160 --> 45:45.760
Let's go get another one.

45:45.760 --> 45:49.920
I think it's retarded because there's no actual law that says you have to do that, but hey,

45:49.920 --> 45:52.640
whatever, that's their store policy, I guess.

45:52.640 --> 45:57.680
Just make sure you follow it, but yeah, who cares?

45:57.680 --> 46:03.080
I remember there was a news thing also where people were doing a sting to see who they

46:03.080 --> 46:09.600
can get to sell a six-year-old or whatever.

46:09.600 --> 46:13.920
Is that like that Dateline NBC where they trap people on the internet and get them to

46:13.920 --> 46:19.880
come over wearing no pants to meet the 12-year-old girl, and then the reporter guy jumps out

46:19.880 --> 46:25.680
and says, surprise, I'm from NBC, and the guy's like, I'm so embarrassed.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.600
Is it like that, but for games?

46:27.600 --> 46:30.880
Something like that.

46:30.880 --> 46:35.460
Every time I watch Dateline, every time I've ever watched Dateline, it's that.

46:35.460 --> 46:38.480
They should just call it the pedophile show.

46:38.480 --> 46:41.720
I bet more people would watch if they changed their name from Dateline to the pedophile

46:41.720 --> 46:42.720
show.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.720
Pedophile show.

46:43.720 --> 46:48.120
Yeah, they could have a little cheesy thing.

46:48.120 --> 46:51.840
This is really bad tonight.

46:51.840 --> 46:53.600
Shadownextgen in chat.

46:53.600 --> 46:57.560
Thank you, chat room, for keeping us on track here, chat.orangeontrader.com.

46:57.560 --> 47:01.220
Shadownextgen says, the policy where managers get fired because of what their employees

47:01.220 --> 47:04.360
did is fucked up.

47:04.360 --> 47:08.920
I think they're responsible for training the employees properly, and so writing up is not

47:08.920 --> 47:09.920
good.

47:09.920 --> 47:12.840
Yeah, but what if I'm so mad at my manager and I'm going to quit anyway?

47:12.840 --> 47:15.880
I'm going to sell a game to fuck my manager over, too.

47:15.880 --> 47:16.880
That's kind of screwed up.

47:16.880 --> 47:20.520
I would hope there's a way to dispute the firing or something.

47:20.520 --> 47:24.720
And to be honest, the only way they're going to get in trouble is if the fucking parent

47:24.720 --> 47:31.160
says, hey, I didn't know this game had that kind of content in it, if you tell the parent

47:31.160 --> 47:32.960
or whatever.

47:32.960 --> 47:39.560
What if, for example, Billy has his friend's older brother buy the game for him or something

47:39.560 --> 47:44.880
like that, and then gets into Billy's hands and his parents go, where the fuck do you

47:44.880 --> 47:45.880
get this from?

47:45.880 --> 47:51.920
Well, the GameStop people sold it to me, and now people are getting fired because of that.

47:51.920 --> 47:57.240
Legend of Zaku makes a very interesting comparison here, says, it's only fair, Jamie, just like

47:57.240 --> 48:01.760
an Abu Ghraib, where the people who carried out the torture got the hammer, while the

48:01.760 --> 48:03.240
folks who ordered it got off scot-free.

48:03.240 --> 48:05.200
Remember the Iraq torture thing?

48:05.200 --> 48:13.460
Yeah, but the GameStop owners aren't telling them to sell the games.

48:13.460 --> 48:17.800
That was the strangest comparison.

48:17.800 --> 48:20.600
No offense to Zaku, because everyone's going to tell their opinions.

48:20.600 --> 48:21.600
That was stupid.

48:21.600 --> 48:22.600
Wow.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.600
I'm sorry.

48:23.600 --> 48:30.040
How is that even a... Oh, yeah, we want you to sell this game, oh, and you're fired.

48:30.040 --> 48:33.200
That's fucking stupid.

48:33.200 --> 48:38.240
God, think before you try to make a witty comparison, thank you.

48:38.240 --> 48:40.720
I'm sorry, but that doesn't work.

48:40.720 --> 48:41.720
Wow.

48:41.720 --> 48:45.680
Yeah, you should be selling more of those stupid, was it more cards or whatever they

48:45.680 --> 48:49.160
call them now, the edge cards.

48:49.160 --> 48:53.080
But what if they sell them pornographic material?

48:53.080 --> 48:54.080
Will they get fired?

48:54.080 --> 48:56.080
Or will they get a raise?

48:56.080 --> 48:58.080
I got a raise.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.280
They get a raise.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.280
Wow.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
Okay.

49:02.280 --> 49:06.840
We promised in the year 2007 our New Year's resolution was to do more PC gaming news,

49:06.840 --> 49:09.800
so Dark Sakura, could you help us achieve our New Year's resolution?

49:09.800 --> 49:14.320
Yes, I will, and this is actually centered towards our European friends.

49:14.320 --> 49:15.320
Yeah.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.320
Cheers.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.320
Did you say jizz?

49:18.320 --> 49:19.320
No, cheers.

49:19.320 --> 49:22.320
I meant like you said jizz.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.320
Jizz.

49:23.320 --> 49:27.800
And wait, PC gaming, like politically correct gaming?

49:27.800 --> 49:29.800
No, like a personal computer.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.800
Because...

49:30.800 --> 49:39.760
Anyway, there's a martial arts MMO called Nine Dragons, and the beta is open in Europe,

49:39.760 --> 49:44.520
actually opening in Europe, they said that you'll actually be able to play and get double

49:44.520 --> 49:51.200
experience until, let's see, actually I'm not finding the date on here is the sad thing.

49:51.200 --> 49:54.160
It may be actually open right now.

49:54.160 --> 49:58.020
In fact, you can actually apply for the, okay, here it is, you can apply for the beta over

49:58.020 --> 50:06.280
on the website, which is ninedragons.acclaim.com slash welcome.htm, and you can keep on going

50:06.280 --> 50:11.640
to the site and check out the demo there, but they're doing a double experience push

50:11.640 --> 50:16.640
that actually may be over already, by the time I saw this, it was already over.

50:16.640 --> 50:19.320
But hey, you can try the game.

50:19.320 --> 50:20.320
Cool.

50:20.320 --> 50:23.560
Dude, I got three more friend requests on Facebook.

50:23.560 --> 50:24.560
I'm so popular.

50:24.560 --> 50:25.560
Stop gloating.

50:25.560 --> 50:26.560
I'm popular.

50:26.560 --> 50:27.560
No.

50:27.560 --> 50:28.560
This is great.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.560
The internet is awesome.

50:29.560 --> 50:30.560
Everybody can be a winner.

50:30.560 --> 50:31.560
It's because I just found out.

50:31.560 --> 50:39.000
As I mentioned in part A, Galactic Civilizations 2 is getting a brand new expansion pack called

50:39.000 --> 50:40.320
Dark Avatar.

50:40.320 --> 50:49.600
It's actually being released early, and yeah, you can definitely check it out now if you're

50:49.600 --> 50:57.160
into that, and it introduces brand new asteroid builds full of resources and unique planets

50:57.160 --> 50:59.400
and other fun stuff like that.

50:59.400 --> 51:04.800
I don't play Galactic Civilizations 2, but it sounds fun.

51:04.800 --> 51:09.920
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

51:09.920 --> 51:12.560
Eddie got a text message and was sharing it with everybody.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.720
Was it more friends requests on Facebook?

51:14.720 --> 51:16.240
No, it was not a Facebook friend request.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.720
I already took care of those.

51:17.720 --> 51:23.800
Oh yeah, Dark Avatar, one week early, good times.

51:23.800 --> 51:26.160
I'm sorry, a heart.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.640
Can I have a hug, Loki?

51:27.640 --> 51:28.640
Can I have a hug?

51:28.640 --> 51:30.120
Can I have a hug, Jamie?

51:30.120 --> 51:32.120
If you buy me dinner.

51:32.120 --> 51:40.160
No, I'll buy you coffee, decaf, because I know you don't drink caffeine this late.

51:40.160 --> 51:41.480
And potato pancakes.

51:41.480 --> 51:42.480
I'll think about it.

51:42.480 --> 51:43.480
Do I get a hug right now?

51:43.480 --> 51:44.480
Live on air?

51:44.480 --> 51:45.480
Yay!

51:45.480 --> 51:49.920
Hold on, now I know this isn't TV, but here, I'll put the mic, when I hug Jamie, I'll put

51:49.920 --> 51:53.320
the mic kind of at my chest level, so maybe you can hear her boob.

51:53.320 --> 51:55.440
I did get that on my boob.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.440
Oh my God.

51:56.440 --> 52:00.760
If you did want to download the expansion pack, you can go to TotalGaming.net for that.

52:00.760 --> 52:02.120
I feel like such a whore now.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.480
It's actually available now.

52:03.480 --> 52:06.920
I guess the retail version is coming out on the 14th.

52:06.920 --> 52:09.560
Rob just made me a whore.

52:09.560 --> 52:16.600
Anyhow, now this, I am declaring, I know it's February, but I'm declaring the upcoming news

52:16.600 --> 52:23.360
article, the best PC gaming story of 2007, right here.

52:23.360 --> 52:24.360
Here it is.

52:24.360 --> 52:27.720
This guy, Warrior Bob, who asked what Commodore 64 games, here it is.

52:27.720 --> 52:30.880
This is the game, and it's coming back, guys.

52:30.880 --> 52:34.240
Arkon is making its return.

52:34.240 --> 52:39.880
Originally released in 1983, Arkon was like, it was like chess, but like when the piece

52:39.880 --> 52:42.680
of one, I know you remember, Irene, because you're as big of a nerd as me, but for the

52:42.680 --> 52:46.240
folks who may not know, Arkon was like chess, but like the pieces would actually do battle

52:46.240 --> 52:48.240
with each other when you tried to capture another piece.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.240
Oh, battle chess.

52:49.240 --> 52:53.740
No, it's not battle chess, because battle chess, the animations were already pre-done.

52:53.740 --> 52:55.960
You actually had like a real-time fighting thing.

52:55.960 --> 52:57.220
This game was also on the NES.

52:57.220 --> 52:58.840
They ported it to several platforms.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.880
What about battle chess?

53:00.880 --> 53:03.240
Arkon is better, and then there was even Arkon 2 and 3.

53:03.240 --> 53:07.400
We don't talk about Arkon 2 and 3, because Arkon was like the best.

53:07.400 --> 53:12.200
What's going on, though, is that Murid Interactive, an investment company who is in the video

53:12.200 --> 53:18.200
game industry, announced a licensing deal with Freefall Games, who created Arkon, to

53:18.200 --> 53:21.040
resurrect the game for modern platforms.

53:21.040 --> 53:22.400
That is the most exciting news ever.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.960
Here's a quote from Murid Interactive.

53:23.960 --> 53:26.480
�We are incredibly pleased to have signed this brand.

53:26.480 --> 53:31.280
Arkon is a well-respected license that has huge nostalgic value for the right reasons.

53:31.280 --> 53:35.520
The gameplay, the great combination of strategic thinking, and the intense arcade action.�

53:35.520 --> 53:41.600
Okay, seriously, if this game comes to Xbox Live Arcade, I will have died from too much

53:41.600 --> 53:43.480
orgasm.

53:43.480 --> 53:44.480
Like right now?

53:44.480 --> 53:45.480
Yeah, seriously.

53:45.480 --> 53:48.120
I'm like, look at my pants.

53:48.120 --> 53:49.120
Look at my pants.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.120
They got bigger.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.120
No, please don't.

53:51.120 --> 53:53.280
I am so incredibly happy.

53:53.280 --> 53:59.560
You don't even know how many games of Arkon I played, light versus dark, probably in the

53:59.560 --> 54:01.720
year 83 or later.

54:01.720 --> 54:03.520
Stop it, Eddie.

54:03.520 --> 54:08.100
Now, did you see, this is also kind of PAC related, did you see the thing that they were

54:08.100 --> 54:09.760
talking about in Spore?

54:09.760 --> 54:13.760
They're showing off some stuff at DICE also, and one of the demonstrations that they showed

54:13.760 --> 54:22.000
were it was, I believe, the Care Bears versus the Klingons.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.080
It created the two races and had them battle it out.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.080
The Kapla-ster.

54:27.080 --> 54:32.620
I can't wait until that game comes out.

54:32.620 --> 54:37.360
I'm going to just become a hermit once that game comes out.

54:37.360 --> 54:38.360
You'll have your game.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.360
I'll have Arkon.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.480
Jamie will have Cookie Mama on the Wii.

54:41.480 --> 54:42.480
We're all happy.

54:42.480 --> 54:43.480
No, you know what?

54:43.480 --> 54:45.200
The whole PC days is on the DS.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.080
They could do Return to Zork.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.080
Zork is awesome.

54:49.080 --> 54:51.640
Only the nerdiest of the nerds, because that would work perfectly on DS.

54:51.640 --> 54:55.080
We found a 404 page that was the first Zork.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.120
Yeah, the text game?

54:57.120 --> 54:58.120
Yeah.

54:58.120 --> 54:59.120
Oh, by the way.

54:59.120 --> 55:00.120
Oh, good point.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.920
Rob D in chat says Jamie will have Rondo of Blood.

55:01.920 --> 55:04.120
Yes, I will have Rondo of Blood.

55:04.120 --> 55:06.840
I have to talk about Rondo of Blood every five seconds, by the way.

55:06.840 --> 55:09.320
Cookie Mama did get pushed up into March.

55:09.320 --> 55:12.520
It originally was in April, so it's coming out sooner.

55:12.520 --> 55:14.120
It's going to be out before my birthday.

55:14.120 --> 55:17.960
Do you know that Eddie actually told me about a fantasy he had once?

55:17.960 --> 55:23.260
Eddie's fantasy was that he actually gets eaten by a grue.

55:23.260 --> 55:26.800
If you get that joke, you're awesome.

55:26.800 --> 55:27.800
Turn out the lights, Rob.

55:27.800 --> 55:28.800
Give me five.

55:28.800 --> 55:29.800
You're a winner.

55:29.800 --> 55:32.560
That's right, because the lights have to be off.

55:32.560 --> 55:35.400
We're all getting eaten by a grue.

55:35.400 --> 55:37.780
That's not a grue.

55:37.780 --> 55:41.680
Why don't you stab the innkeeper?

55:41.680 --> 55:42.680
The sheriff will come.

55:42.680 --> 55:43.680
Here you go.

55:43.680 --> 55:44.680
Here's your grue.

55:44.680 --> 55:45.680
Stop it.

55:45.680 --> 55:46.680
I found you a grue.

55:46.680 --> 55:51.880
I am Morpheus.

55:51.880 --> 55:53.560
This show makes me happy.

55:53.560 --> 55:56.120
I love this.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.120
It is pitch black.

55:57.120 --> 55:59.840
You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

55:59.840 --> 56:00.840
Good times.

56:00.840 --> 56:01.840
Wouldn't that work?

56:01.840 --> 56:04.440
Because I looked on the internet, it's only 95 megabytes, so they could totally have that

56:04.440 --> 56:05.440
on the DS.

56:05.440 --> 56:08.640
If you want to look that up on Wikipedia, by the way, that's G-R-U-E.

56:08.640 --> 56:09.640
Do your homework, kids.

56:09.640 --> 56:10.640
What is a grue?

56:10.640 --> 56:14.440
A grue is a sinister looking presence in the dark places of the earth.

56:14.440 --> 56:18.200
Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear

56:18.200 --> 56:19.260
of light.

56:19.260 --> 56:22.680
No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws

56:22.680 --> 56:24.480
to tell the tale.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.480
Grue.

56:25.480 --> 56:31.160
Actually, I read somewhere in an M. Night Shyamalan film that grues hang out with scrunts,

56:31.160 --> 56:32.160
actually.

56:32.160 --> 56:33.160
You're a scrunt.

56:33.160 --> 56:34.160
On the weekend.

56:34.160 --> 56:35.160
Rob's a scrunty bitch.

56:35.160 --> 56:38.160
Rob's the scruntiest person in the room.

56:38.160 --> 56:40.160
You dirty scrunt.

56:40.160 --> 56:41.720
What?

56:41.720 --> 56:43.800
Back to console news, DarkSakura.

56:43.800 --> 56:44.800
What?

56:44.800 --> 56:45.800
Grue, you scrunch.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.440
I'm busy looking at pictures of Captain America.

56:48.440 --> 56:52.440
I mean, we're on to a blood.

56:52.440 --> 56:53.440
I'll steal your story.

56:53.440 --> 56:54.440
Okay, Sega Sammy.

56:54.440 --> 56:55.440
Oh.

56:55.440 --> 56:56.440
Oh, Sega.

56:56.440 --> 56:57.440
Sega, Sega.

56:57.440 --> 56:58.440
Ah!

56:58.440 --> 56:59.440
What?

56:59.440 --> 57:00.440
Oh, my God.

57:00.440 --> 57:01.440
What?

57:01.440 --> 57:02.440
That.

57:02.440 --> 57:03.440
That what?

57:03.440 --> 57:04.440
I can't see.

57:04.440 --> 57:05.440
It's an upcoming story.

57:05.440 --> 57:06.440
Okay.

57:06.440 --> 57:07.440
She-Man.

57:07.440 --> 57:08.440
Sega!

57:08.440 --> 57:09.440
How the mighty have fallen.

57:09.440 --> 57:10.440
Shut up.

57:10.440 --> 57:11.440
Saturn.

57:11.440 --> 57:12.440
Sega, Saturn.

57:12.440 --> 57:13.440
No, anyway.

57:13.440 --> 57:14.440
Kill me.

57:14.440 --> 57:15.440
Okay.

57:15.440 --> 57:22.120
After the show, though, we need you to set up the thing.

57:22.120 --> 57:33.240
Anyway, Sega Sammy profits have slid 23%, and I blame them for abandoning the Dreamcast.

57:33.240 --> 57:41.880
So yeah, their net income went down from $526 million to $409 million.

57:41.880 --> 57:46.640
Sales dropped by 4% to $3.35 billion.

57:46.640 --> 57:52.440
You could say that their sales flew off course like a poorly controlled Sonic from Sonic

57:52.440 --> 57:55.720
the Hedgehog on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

57:55.720 --> 57:56.720
Wow.

57:56.720 --> 58:00.440
And actually, their Pachinko machines are actually becoming a lot less popular than

58:00.440 --> 58:02.160
they were, too.

58:02.160 --> 58:04.800
And Pachinko is really, really a big thing.

58:04.800 --> 58:08.760
GS68 has been spamming the chat room, and usually I don't encourage this, but spamming

58:08.760 --> 58:13.660
the chat room with this site, segasucks.net, and I'm looking at it, and it looks like somebody's

58:13.660 --> 58:15.280
GeoCities web page.

58:15.280 --> 58:18.240
Hey, that's my GeoCities web page.

58:18.240 --> 58:22.000
Hey, way to use the center...

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Let me look at the FAQ.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Way to use the center...

58:24.000 --> 58:27.080
Or the about page.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.080
Center paragraph.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.080
See, about this site.

58:29.080 --> 58:32.680
The first, last, and only thing Sega fans ever have to say when I try to tell them my

58:32.680 --> 58:37.320
site is about stopping companies from ripping gamers off is, ha ha, yes siree, don't you

58:37.320 --> 58:39.200
know all companies are just out to make money?

58:39.200 --> 58:40.200
Bob, bob, bob.

58:40.200 --> 58:41.200
What is the word?

58:41.200 --> 58:42.200
Yes siree.

58:42.200 --> 58:43.200
I don't know.

58:43.200 --> 58:44.200
Yes siree, bob.

58:44.200 --> 58:45.200
I was going to say, you have to have the bob at the end.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.200
Do we have a new...

58:46.200 --> 58:48.480
Loki, you have a new story to talk to us about?

58:48.480 --> 58:49.960
Yes, let's talk about Crackdown.

58:49.960 --> 58:50.960
Yes siree.

58:50.960 --> 58:57.920
Crackdown, one of the most awesome games this week, at least the demo is.

58:57.920 --> 59:01.840
It's only going to be, they're only going to have male avatars to play as right now,

59:01.840 --> 59:07.160
because apparently they haven't finished the female ones, and I guess the females have

59:07.160 --> 59:12.360
a whole new set of animations for bulking up as you progress through the game.

59:12.360 --> 59:16.580
Because I remember at E3 you could play as a woman in Crackdown.

59:16.580 --> 59:19.240
So maybe download PAX later.

59:19.240 --> 59:23.520
What did they not, I mean if the animations were kind of already there, I guess maybe

59:23.520 --> 59:25.360
it was all the cut scenes and stuff.

59:25.360 --> 59:30.920
Or maybe they didn't have time to put in all the animations of emotional breakdowns and

59:30.920 --> 59:31.920
pie baking.

59:31.920 --> 59:32.920
Don't forget periods.

59:32.920 --> 59:33.920
Oh, and periods.

59:33.920 --> 59:34.920
Thank you, Rice Princess.

59:34.920 --> 59:35.920
You're welcome.

59:35.920 --> 59:43.200
So yeah, if you're looking to play a female character, that won't be happening.

59:43.200 --> 59:46.280
But you know what though, Crackdown was one of those games that they said that if later

59:46.280 --> 59:51.600
on they wanted to add a new island, a new set of gangs or whatever, they could do that.

59:51.600 --> 59:53.040
So I don't see why they wouldn't build that.

59:53.040 --> 59:54.040
The woman gang.

59:54.040 --> 59:55.640
You know, female avatars later.

59:55.640 --> 59:58.400
So you know, it's probably going to be a download pack.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.840
We're here to complain you to death.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:11.520
Because you know you have your agility, firearms, explosives, and driving, well they can't level

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520
up driving skills.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.100
I mean, come on.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:18.200
And so complaining I guess would have to be in there.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:36.920
You

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.520
are putting me looking forward and Crackdown in the same sentence.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.680
Jamie can't give two shits about Crackdown.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.200
I can't really, not even with you know, X-Lax.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.360
She's constipated when it comes to Crackdown.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.680
I would need a colonic, sorry.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.720
You know if I lose a little more weight, every time I bend over you're going to see a Crackdown

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.320
actually.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:13.800
Speaking of things coming out your ass, EGM posted seven rumors in their magazine.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.280
I don't know how founded these rumors are or not, but I'm going to share them with you

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.280
now.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.280
These are from issue number 213.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.640
Rumor number one we already talked about a little bit earlier in the program.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.040
Square has another MMO in the works for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.480
It won't be in Vanadiel, but a world from previous FF games.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.960
So that could be in tandem with...

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.960
Is it Ivalis?

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.960
Maybe.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.960
It could be an Ivalis game.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.960
Oh my God, that'd be awesome.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.960
Because that's great.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960
Or what if it was like Final Fantasy VI MMO?

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.960
I'm sure a lot of folks have a bone over that.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:41.960
Hot.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.960
I would hella play that.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.600
Rumor number two is that Tekken 6 got pushed back until 2008.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600
QQ anyway.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.600
Sorry, Jamie.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.600
Tekken 6, 2008.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600
Bastards!

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.800
That's just a rumor though.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.200
EGM could be full of it.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200
Bastards!

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.840
That is probably true.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:00.040
Rumor three, Mistwalker is planning a Blue Dragon 2, but only if it does well in the

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040
US.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.160
A DS spinoff is also possible.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.080
Rumor number four is Wipeout will hit the PlayStation 3 in 2007 and it uses the Motor

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.920
Storm engine.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.440
That could be interesting.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:19.080
Rumor number five is my hero, Mizuguchi, is working on a Space Channel 5 follow up.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.080
Space Channel 6.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.080
No, I'm just kidding.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.600
I don't know what it's called, but that would be awesome.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.040
It'd be Space Channel 5 2, like MTV2.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:31.400
Rumor number six is there's an Indiana Jones game to hit with a movie in 2008.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.400
Duh!

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.640
Every frickin' big movie gets a game time.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.040
We've already seen that at E3.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.040
Duh!

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.040
So, yeah.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.040
That's not a rumor.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.440
And then lastly, EA is making a Kitty Madden.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.440
That's interesting.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.840
They already have like an Atari, like the backyard football and stuff that sucks balls,

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.920
so I mean, they could easily do that.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920
What is a Kitty Madden?

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.920
Like a Kitty Madden?

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920
No.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.920
Yes.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.000
They're bringing the Puppy Bowl and the Kitty Halftime to the console, as we talked about

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
last week.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.720
EA has heard our prayers.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.040
Is that what it would sound like?

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040
Kinda, yeah.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.040
Could we hear that again?

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.040
Meow, meow, meow.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040
Thank you.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040
You're welcome.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040
Wow.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040
Playing football.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.920
Drew Nami says a Space Channel 5-2 was already released, wasn't it?

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.800
And that's true, but more Space Channel 5 could not be a bad thing.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.640
I have Space Channel 5-2, and that gave me fit, because of the whole backwards level.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640
I want pudding.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.040
I want more, not like actual pudding, but the character.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.680
I told him way to be random.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.680
Burr Shaw's one set EA's Linger Abel, 2008.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.680
That would be one for the kids.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.280
That would be comparison to Kitty Abel.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.680
All right, we're going to be taking-

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.280
Irene does have a point.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.640
I would love to see kittens in like little football jerseys.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.640
I'm sorry, but that would be as cute as it is.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.080
I would probably buy that.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.080
You do?

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.080
All right.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.080
Well, we'll see if EA answers your prayers.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.080
The game developers.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.360
We'll be getting your Skype calls very, very soon.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.360
We have a couple more stories.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.480
Well, here's a bunch of no shit, Sherlock.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:08.800
Yeah, the Wii has outsold the PS3 by a mere three to one ratio in January in Japan.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.760
Take that, bitches.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.520
Yeah, like I said, a bunch of no shit there.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.840
I remember, actually one of my coworkers was asking me, he read an article that some PlayStation

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:27.440
rep or someone at Sony was claiming that the PS3 was outselling the Wii and the DS combined

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.440
in Japan.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.000
It didn't make our show roll tonight because there was a lot of news, but there was a pretty

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.160
well-circulated story out there that somebody from Sony Computer Europe said something like,

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.760
if you can find a PlayStation 3 out there on store shelves, I'll give you $1,200 or

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760
something like that.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.000
Then they promptly proceeded to show four of them at the same place?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.520
As I saw a bunch of them at GameStop today, wow, I could have made $12,000, but I don't

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520
think he was serious.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:05:01.400
See, if they're selling at a three to one ratio, so basically they're selling, okay,

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.400
the system's what?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.440
Let's just round up to $300, right?

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.700
So they're making $900 for every $600 that Sony makes.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:17.440
They're already beating them by $300 per system, not per system, but per group sale if you're

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.100
comparing Nintendo's 3 to Sony's 1.

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:25.820
And they're not even accounting if they're doing the high-end system or the low-end system.

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:31.420
So even profit-wise, Nintendo's got the head above it because I've actually argued

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:32.420
this with some people.

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:37.560
They're saying, oh, since Sony's selling for more, they're going to make more money.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:43.600
No, because Nintendo loves us, and supply is doing its damned best to meet demand.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.600
Wow, this is great.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:51.200
Jernami sent me a link to this week's Penny Arcade, which actually makes fun of this specific

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.200
instance as well.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:57.080
It says, in a recent interview, SCEA President Jack Tretton claimed that he would pay a $1,200

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:01.200
bounty on any PS3 system that was found on store shelves, and they went around town and

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:05.440
proceeded to get two at the Best Buy across the street, one at the Target, and by the

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.800
end, they'd racked up $13,200.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:12.440
And then it says, when we get the money, we should go get a couple of Wiis.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.400
Yeah, if we can find one.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.000
Which is, you know what, if you're a Sony fanboy, I'm sorry that we keep picking on

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.520
you, but it's true, I mean, Wiis are still hard to come by.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.680
Keep in mind what I said earlier in part A about the guy who came, dude, I got a Wii

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.640
today, I actually found one, like, Target got a shipment this morning.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:33.720
It's true, like, Wiis are still kind of hard to come by, and PlayStation 3s or...

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:38.120
Yeah, my local blockbuster, like, all the employees there are, like, vying for the Nintendo,

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.760
and like, I go in, they'll be like, oh my god, I got mine, because they, like, cannot

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.760
find them.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:42.760
It's crazy.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:48.040
And you know what, once Tactics comes out on PSP, the PSP's gonna outsell the PS3 again.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040
You think?

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040
The PSP's gonna outsell the PS3?

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.040
Yeah, when Tactics comes out, because I'm gonna buy one.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.320
You are not a PSP fangirl, in the least.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:00.160
I absolutely am not, like, I could care less, but with this news about Tactics coming onto

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.280
PSP with the frickin' Dark Knights, woo-hoo, I'm so happy.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.280
Did you just come?

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280
What was that?

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.280
A little bit, yeah.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:12.480
But, um, yeah, and then, Castlevania, and then Luminous 2, and yeah, I think I'm gonna

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.480
have to invest in one.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.480
All right.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:21.240
Well, thank you, Jamie, for the Japanese sales report, or should I say, arigato.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.400
I did find something completely unrelated, though, and that's someone made Captain America

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.800
in Smackdown vs. Raw.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.600
You're right, that's completely unrelated.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.680
I know, but I think it's pretty funny.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.680
Low-key.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:39.200
One more story, and then we're gonna go to our Skype line at 877-GAME-OLR.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.760
One game that has a character creation mode as well as Mortal Kombat Armageddon, and well,

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.280
that being the last one that's gonna be on our current-gen consoles, we do have the rumors

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:53.520
of Mortal Kombat 8, and they've basically said they're gonna be using the Unreal 3 engine,

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.880
because everybody and their mother are fucking using the Unreal 3 engine for their games,

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.280
so great.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.880
It's gonna be great-looking, so hurrah.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.960
I don't know, no details, really, on the game at all, except that they were supposed to

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:14.840
be starting from scratch again, so, whatever that means.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:21.660
Mortal Kombat on the Unreal engine, I mean, is it gonna be like a 3D fighter, or, I don't,

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:25.880
because they say it's not gonna be like a fighting-type game like we know today, so,

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.800
I mean, but I can't help but think of, like, some of those really crappy Mythologies games

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.020
at Sub-Zero, although the Shallon Monks game wasn't bad.

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.760
It reminded me of, like, Ninja Turtles.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.080
But with Mortal Kombat characters, they should make a game like that, where you could, like,

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.760
throw Kung Lao's hat as a projectile.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.960
What would you want to see in a new Mortal Kombat game?

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.240
Where could they take the franchise?

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.880
Oops.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:55.240
Well, I guess we'll open up the Skype line and see what our listeners have to say about

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.240
that.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.440
You can give us a call, just go to orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.280
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.800
Also you can give us a call with the old-fashioned telephone.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.680
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:14.240
That's toll-free in the United States and Canada, but not toll-free, sad face, abroad.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.680
You'll have to use the Skype line if you're in the UK or Australia, in which case it's

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:18.680
probably past your bedtime.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.680
Wait.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680
I just want to say.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.680
What?

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.720
They have to use the old-fashioned telephone, like a rotary phone?

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.720
No, you can use touch tone.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.720
That would be acceptable.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.000
Or a party line where you call the operator.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
You could even...

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Like two cans in a stream?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
A cellular...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Yes.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.080
Actually, we're having the Dixie Cups installed this week.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.120
That's fascinating, and people will be able to use the two tin cans and a piece of yarn

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.120
to talk to us soon.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.120
Please.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.960
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:42.960
Who's this caller?

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.960
Legend of Zaku.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.800
Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.920
What's on your mind?

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.200
Just random stuff.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.280
Yes, I know.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.280
You're full of random stuff tonight.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.080
I'm not taking it back, by the way.

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.840
Zaku, what's on your mind?

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.840
I meant...

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.680
Basically, what I meant when I said that was that just like a manager is like a captain

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.600
on a ship, he's responsible for everyone that runs it.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.440
I mean, that's what you're now doing.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.040
You have to admit, though, it was a weird...

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:17.040
Yeah, but is a responsible captain on a ship going to order his crew to throw their shipment

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.040
overboard?

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.040
Hmm?

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.040
Still...

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.800
You were doing it as a...

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.960
Your reference specifically stated that the manager was ordering the employees to sell

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.960
to me.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.960
Isn't that what happened at the Boston Tea Party?

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.960
Touche.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.600
You know what?

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.480
Think your comparisons through before stating them.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.560
I understand what you mean, however your comparison was completely out of place.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.560
Can't we just all get along?

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.560
Can't we just...

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.560
No!

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.560
Let's hug.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.560
No.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.560
Not until you buy me pie.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.760
If you changed the tea and touche to a D, it would be douchey.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.760
Shut up!

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.560
Zaku, please, put us back on track.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.560
What do you want to talk about?

01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:02.520
I want to talk about something I saw on YouTube.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.640
I swear to God, I'm not fucking with this connection, just like to Jamie.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.320
Jamie, are you fucking with this connection?

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.720
No, I'm watching someone draw Captain America.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.040
Zaku, try it one more time.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.600
Unfortunately, if you can't get it out clearly, we're going to have to move on.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.600
Zaku, what was on your mind?

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.480
Basically, I'm talking about something I saw right now.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.960
Send it in a text message, Zaku.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.760
We'll try to get to it later.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.680
Sorry, but it's just not coming through.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.480
You'll hear it on the playback.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480
That's a bummer.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.120
All right, if you want to call us, 877-GAME-OLR.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.520
I swear I was not screwing with that call.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.520
But I was.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.520
Poor Zaku.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.960
Send your question over private message, Zaku.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.960
I'll take it.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.960
All right.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960
Let's go to this call.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:55.680
Hey, Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.680
Well, I recently acquired a laptop.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.280
It's a new VAIO, and it has Vista on it.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.560
Ah, so it's a brand new laptop, okay.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560
Yeah.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:07.880
Um, I do not like it at all.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.880
Really?

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.880
What's wrong with it?

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:20.840
Well, I mean, there are some applications on it that aren't exactly, you know, well,

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.320
they're smaller applications.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:30.360
One of them, I think, is actually a foreign one called a Bemania DX, and it's kind of

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.400
like the step mania of B-Mania.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.400
Right.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.400
That wouldn't work.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:40.320
So, basically, you're upset because a lot of the old games and things you were using

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.760
on Windows XP won't work on Windows Vista.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:54.360
That and also that, I'm trying to remember, the main reason that I downloaded it, well,

01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:00.200
one of them was for music creation software, and my sequencer wouldn't work on it.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.640
It just performs pretty poor.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:09.760
But it's pretty, I mean, Vista has all those fancy Windows animations and stuff.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.520
I mean, the prettiness outweighs the usefulness of the applications, right?

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.040
No.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.880
Do you think Microsoft's going to fix this with time?

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.880
Yes.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.680
I've always said that give it a couple of years, and I'm pretty sure that it will be

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.000
an awesome application.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.280
So what caused you to jump on board the Vista train at this point?

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:34.440
Was it just because you had no other choice because you got the new laptop?

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:41.320
Yeah, they took the model out that I was going to get.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.320
I see.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.560
I mean, it's really too bad because it's a great skin, but I can do everything that I'm

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.520
doing on Vista with an XP.

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.720
Are you looking forward to any of the gaming that's supposed to be coming out with Vista,

01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.920
such as Halo 2 or any of that stuff?

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:09.000
Windows, now that I have a little more powerful Windows machine, because my other two were

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.520
pretty, they were really, really old.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:24.560
So now that I have something, I got a 2.3 gig processor and two gigs memory.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:30.340
Now you're the cool kid on the block because you have your 2.3 bazillion hertz or whatever

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:35.800
it is, and a Windows Vista.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.800
So you have the biggest internet penis on the block.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.800
I'm down here.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.800
There you go.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:42.800
I got you.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.800
All right.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.280
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:54.920
Also, I'd like to kind of give my opinion on how Konami basically released the same

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.640
game over and over again, but with new songs.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.640
All right.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.600
Please, because we've got to keep it moving.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:07.840
Whenever I bought a new BeatMania game, at least, I don't know about DDR, but when I

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.480
bought a new BeatMania game, I significantly improved.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.960
I almost jumped another level up.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:22.660
So I think that new songs are really all that I need to justify a whole new game.

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:28.440
Because you have a lot of new songs to kind of practice with and new charts to kind of

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.320
help you out where the other charts were getting a little stale.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.320
Yep.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.320
All right.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.640
Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for the call.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640
And have a good week.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.640
Thanks for calling in.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.640
Okay?

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.640
Bye.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.640
All right.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.640
Later.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.640
Bye.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.640
Bye.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.640
Later.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.640
So he has a huge EP?

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.640
Yeah, he has a huge EP.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.540
It sounded like either he was high or he had the show on in the background and he was listening

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:52.540
to it.

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.540
Because I thought I heard myself.

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:54.540
Maybe both.

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:55.680
Maybe both.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.680
Just kidding.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.680
We tease because we love.

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.200
And he does some other calls.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.720
Let's go over here to this call.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.720
Hi.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.720
Who's this?

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.000
Hey, it's Saisha here?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Hi, Saisha.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
What's on your mind?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.220
Turn down your speakers because we can hear ourselves a little bit.

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.820
What's on your mind?

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.260
I can hear it get echo-ing.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.280
Oh, sorry.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.320
It's echo-ing.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.320
That's all right.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.320
What's on your mind?

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.520
We have a delay too, but that's because it's, you know, our voices are traveling all the

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.520
way across the Atlantic.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:31.520
So I was just going to ask a question about Final Fantasy 12.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.520
Yes, what do you want to know about Final Fantasy 12?

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:43.520
I want to know where the story leads to because I look on the internet everywhere and I can't find anything about it and I like spoilers.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.520
You want spoilers on the story?

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.520
Yeah, I'm impatient.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.520
I can't tell you that because that would ruin it for our listeners.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:59.520
You could go to GameFAQs.com and there's a bunch of FAQs on how to get through the game or the strategy guide that's available.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.520
I'm sure there's places out there where you can get it spoiled.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.520
You're just not looking hard enough, buddy.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.520
And besides, I haven't beaten it so I couldn't tell you what happens.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.520
There was like 50 games that came out in November that I haven't played.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.520
You haven't beaten it yet?

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.520
No, I haven't. I got sucked back into WoW.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.520
Oh true, I got back into WoW at level 70 already.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:29.520
Is there anything else you want to ask us about tonight besides the spoilers for Final Fantasy 12 which we're not sharing?

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.520
Why are you so crazy this evening?

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.520
I don't know. Why are we crazy this evening?

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.520
That's my fault.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:41.520
That's partially Eddie and a rice princess being here, but what else? Maybe it's just something in the air.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:46.520
I think that I'm a little bit unable to concentrate quite correctly today.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.520
Thanks. You sound really cute and hot.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.520
Stop trying to get a date on the show.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:55.520
Well, how am I supposed to date him? You sound sexy. Sorry.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:58.520
Which means he's probably taken.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.520
What was I going to say?

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.520
I've been sick, so I think it kind of affects your brain.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.520
Dark Sakura was way this week. You were with Chris this weekend, right?

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.520
So she was hamming it up with the girlfriends this weekend.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.520
And Loki, well, he probably got laid or something right before the show.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:21.520
Oh, yeah, because getting laid makes me crazy.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.520
It puts me in a good mood.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.520
No, and I didn't get laid right before the show.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.520
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.520
Earlier in the day.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.520
All right.

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.520
Saisha, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much for your phone call.

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.520
And cheers.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.520
Take care.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.520
There was too much delay. I couldn't keep it going. I'm sorry, kids.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.520
I wanted to say bye, sexy. Thanks a lot.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.520
We got it. Say it now. Saisha's listening.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.520
Bye, sexy.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.520
All right, there you go. You are so weird.

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.520
You're weird. Your face is weird.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.520
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.520
Oh, hi, this is Judy.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.520
Hi, what's on your mind?

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520
Hey, Judy.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.520
Hey, what's up, sexy pants?

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:12.520
What's on your mind, sweetie?

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:22.520
I was going to ask you guys if World of Warcraft is really worth it.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.520
Wait, we can hardly hear you. What about World of Warcraft?

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:32.520
When you want to ask what about World of Warcraft?

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.520
Is it really worth it?

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:40.520
She's actually being eaten by a grew as she's talking to us, which is why she can't stop laughing.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.520
It's so worth it.

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:46.520
What is World of Warcraft? You're the biggest addict probably out of all of us, right, princess?

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520
What do you think?

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.520
Yeah.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.520
You hated all MMOs before World of Warcraft.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.520
I did. I absolutely hated them.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.520
What sold you on World of Warcraft specifically?

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.520
Well, I don't know.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.520
Wow, that was an awesome answer.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.520
Matt gave me the two-week demo-y disk thing, whatever.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:05.520
It's all Matt, our friend. Love you, Matt.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:08.520
And I was like, whatever, I'm bored. I'm not working.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:13.520
Uni hung up. She was embarrassed. Don't be embarrassed. It was fun.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.520
And I'm like, okay, I'll give it a try.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:22.520
And I got to level 20 in two days or something, and you can't go past level 20 if you're on the demo thing.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.520
And I'm like, aw, man, that sucks. This game's awesome.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.520
And so I subscribed to it, and then I signed my life away. It was pretty awesome.

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:35.520
By the way, Paradox Vincent, who I accused of being high earlier, sent me a message that said, no, you're a towel.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.520
Get it? The towel. Forget it.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:43.520
DJ Tyrant wants to know, Rice Princess, what level are you?

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.520
I don't have any 60s, and I've been playing for two years.

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.520
But you're a twink. It's because you're a twink, right?

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:52.520
I have many twinks. I have a lot of PVP twinks.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:55.520
Warsong Goldshow for life, 111.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:01.520
My highest level tune is a 38 Warlock on Trollbane.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:06.520
Uni, I bet you any of the WoW players would be glad to hook you up with a free demo of WoW,

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.520
because they do that thing where you can download a demo on WorldOfWarcraft.com.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.520
So you know what? It's like the whole Xbox 360 strategy, demos, try before you buy.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.520
And I think that's the best way to figure it out.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.520
Ooh, girl, and I'll play it with you.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.520
I'll show you around, girl.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:25.520
It's the girls' club on Warcraft.

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:29.520
Here it is, Uni says the classic, it's just that I want a Blood Elf.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.520
Blood Elves are hot, dude.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.520
I want a Blood Elf in my bed.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.520
I love Black Boy. Black Boy says, okay, WoW has twinks.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.520
Can you explain what a twink is?

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.520
Not the gay twink.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:44.520
Not the gay porn kind of twink, and if you don't know what that is, you're fine.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.520
What is a twink in WoW, Bryce Princess? Where does the name come from?

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:55.520
A twink in WoW is someone that has the best possible gear, the best enchants,

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.520
the best everything that you can have at that level.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.520
And it helps if they have blonde hair, and they're usually Russian.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:05.520
You're terrible, Ron.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.520
So I have a lot of twinks, and it's easy for me because I'm a girl,

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.520
and I say, hi, I'll be your Internet girlfriend, give me gold.

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.520
And they're like, okay, that's pretty cool.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.520
I'm like, sweet, I have a twink now, bye.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.520
Nice knowing you.

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.520
No, I'm not really like that all the time.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.520
But yeah, that's what a twink is.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.520
That was educational.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.520
I'm not going to explain what a gay twink is.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.520
Look it up on Wikipedia.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.520
Isn't that so cool?

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:40.520
Or you could be a guy and just have a really high-pitched voice and be like, hi.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.520
Actually, they have a Valentine's Day event going on right now.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.520
They do.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.520
I was trying to have my girl hit on other girls, but I didn't, nah.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.520
You were trying to be a lesbian?

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.520
Yeah, that's fun. Lesbians are fun.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.520
Yeah, you're supposed to hit on guys, and they'll give you money.

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.520
Actually, no, I ended up hitting on guys because I screwed up.

01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.520
I got the wrong thing, so I just decided to play it straight.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.520
But you don't actually hit on other characters.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.520
You hit on other NPCs is the way it works.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.520
Yeah, I know, with the hearts on their heads.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.520
Are we really talking about well?

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520
I can't believe it.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520
Please, let's go to another call.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520
Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.520
What do you want to talk about besides Warcraft?

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.520
How about BeatMania and virtual console games?

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520
First off, who is this?

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.520
Who said you could call?

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.520
I paid Loki five bucks.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.520
Oh, it must be DMN. Hi, DMN. What's on your mind?

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:27.520
I'm doing pretty good. You guys were talking about...

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.520
Wait, DMN, you've been a long-time listener to the show, right?

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.520
Yeah.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.520
Is tonight a good show or a bad show? Be honest.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.520
God, the show's hilarious. What are you talking about?

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.520
Awesome. Winner.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:39.520
Yay, the winner is me.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520
Heart!

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:41.520
Level up.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.520
We're listening to the one-day show for a second.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.520
Wow, sorry, I just gained five stamina.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.520
I'm sorry, you want BeatMania, Wii, what?

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.520
What's one to pole smoking?

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:54.520
Well, you guys were talking about the BeatMania location test in Illinois.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:24:04.520
I'm almost wondering if that's a precursor to the oft-rumored, talked-about BeatMania sequel coming to the consoles.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:08.520
You know, but we didn't see it at Gamers' Day, which is a little bit of a...

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:13.520
It's not going to happen, but it is a little bit of a frowny face next to the idea,

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.520
because they did announce BeatMania 1 at Gamers' Day last year,

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.520
so I would say it's still up in the air.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:24.520
No, I'm not familiar with Gamers' Day. Did they announce SupernovaCS?

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.520
Oh, well, we only ran about four stories on Gamers' Day on the site,

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.520
so I urge you to check out wordslouchradio.com.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.520
Yeah, look at the website, kids.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:34.520
What, did you want to know about Gamers' Day?

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.520
Yeah, was SupernovaCS announced last year?

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.520
I don't remember. Actually, it may not have been.

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:45.520
You may have me there. I don't think they did announce it.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:52.520
I think they were showing BeatMania last year, and it was the karaoke revolution country.

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.520
They didn't show Supernova till E3.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:57.520
But they had the arcade machine there, and they announced Supernova for the console.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.520
That's right. They made the announcement of Supernova in the arcades at Gamers' Day last year.

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.520
No, they said the consoles too, I think.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.520
Oh, yeah, and they said it was going to come to consoles, but they just didn't sew the playable game.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.520
That's right, because Loki and I were tooting our own horn here.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.520
Some of the first people in the country to play DDR Supernova. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.520
You didn't have to do the arm gestures, Ross.

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.520
Who wants to judge me? Who wants to judge me?

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.520
You look like you're trying to fly away.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.520
How about with a steel-toed boot?

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.520
I wouldn't wash that hand, by the way.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.520
Ew.

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:33.520
Sephirot1215 says the last consumer DDR shown at Gamers' Day was extreme.

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.520
Okay, there you go.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:42.520
Now, going back, I know Eddie was talking about how virtual console games are priced so expensively.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.520
He sure was.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:51.520
I could have put that on the N64 games. I think $10 is stupid, especially since that system blew.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.520
Pokemon Snap, motherfucker. I'd pay $10 for that.

01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:00.520
About a year ago, they were announcing they were considering maybe having all the NES games be free,

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.520
and I mean, I don't see why that would have been out of the question.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.520
I mean, like you said, the games were like 20 years old.

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.520
They made their money off of them, and now it's like they're selling bits.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.520
And I could go buy Animal Crossing and get half those games for free.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:18.520
Yeah, but I honestly think that $8 for SNES games is a pretty fair price.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:21.520
I mean, I'd gladly pay $8 for Link.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.520
Eddie disagrees.

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.520
Why do you disagree?

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.520
I disagree, too.

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.520
Why? Because you guys are poor.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.520
In part, yes.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.520
No, I mean, it's just the whole thing.

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.520
I understand they have to pay for setting up for the virtual console,

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.520
but they don't have to pay for actually making cartridges, sending them out, shipping them out.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:41.520
What if they charge one fee for access to the system?

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.520
Let's say you had to pay $20 for Super Nintendo, and then you paid $2 for each game.

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.520
Would you go for that?

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.520
No.

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.520
No.

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.520
Because you don't want to pay anything because you're a cheap, cheap whore.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.520
Well, I mean, obviously I don't want to pay for shit.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.520
That's why I get all this free gold, and wow.

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.520
But I just don't think you should have to pay for it.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.520
Obviously, we're just playing the games for retro reasons or whatever.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.520
It's not like we really want to obtain the game.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.520
And also, Nintendo's trying to target that new generation.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.520
Half of the people who may be playing the Wii have never even played these games before.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.520
True.

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:18.520
It doesn't mean they have to charge so much fucking money for it.

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:24.520
Actually, though, I notice a lot of people that are getting into the Wii kind of remember the old NES,

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.520
like the old Mario Brothers and that stuff.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.520
So I think there's a certain nostalgia value to it, too.

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:36.520
But I don't think there's going to be a lot of people that go, you know, OMG, it's Superstar Soldier,

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.520
because a lot of people probably don't remember that game unless you're hardcore gaming.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.520
I mean, I'm not going to be holding my breath on virtual console games coming out,

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.520
but it'll be a nice thing to have if I see, oh, look, this game.

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:51.520
Okay, I haven't played this, and I've been interested in playing it.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.520
Bam, I'll download it.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:56.520
All right, DMN, anything else for our listeners?

01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.520
SSJ100, Matt's going to be on STFU this week. That's about it.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.520
That should be fun.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.520
STFU Thursday nights right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.520
Hey, I heard Jimmy was on cross platform this week.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.520
I heard. He didn't tell me until like a couple days ago.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:16.520
How is it that you guys have accomplished more in like 11, 12 weeks of your program than we've accomplished in five years?

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.520
We model your work ethic.

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.520
Dear DMN, I hate you. Love, Rob.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.520
No, no, you don't.

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.520
You're right, I don't. Hugs and kisses, DMN.

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.520
Don't be a deck.

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.520
Hey, take care.

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.520
All right.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:38.520
So, you know, I'm going to make a show that counters STFU, and it's going to be called DIAF.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.520
Diet of Fire?

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.520
Yeah.

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.520
That'd be good.

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.520
And it's just going to be setting people on fire.

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.520
Good times.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.520
Last minute stories. Let's go around and get the last minute stories.

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.520
Anybody have anything they want to share?

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.520
I do.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.520
Okay, yes, Dark Sakura.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.520
Wand of Blood.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.520
Dark Sakura will not be seen on next week's program, or any program afterwards, actually.

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.520
Because she'll be playing Wand of Blood. Gosh.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.520
Actually, I did have something, though, off topic.

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:05.520
I'm actually not going to be able to be live Tuesday, but the Tuesday after I will be.

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.520
Sweet.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:07.520
I have my midterms.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.520
More Pump Up the Volume goodness.

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.520
Yep, Pump Up the Volume will be back the week after next.

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.520
Awesome.

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.520
Loki, you have anything last minute?

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:15.520
No.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:17.520
Wow, nothing. That's a first. Amazing.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.520
Well, I don't have anything either, so I guess that's it.

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.520
That's another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Down the Crapper.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.520
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.520
You guys rock.

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.520
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.520
We'll start off with our special guest tonight.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.520
Thank you guys so much for being here.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:38.520
Rice Princess, your final thought.

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.520
That was a queef, not a fart.

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.520
Okay, thank you for clarifying.

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:43.520
Wow.

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.520
Casper the Gay, also known as Eddie.

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.520
Your final thought.

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:52.520
Yeah, don't join Rob's face site thing. Join my MySpace at W-I-I-D-D-Y.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.520
What?

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.520
Nothing.

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.520
Oh, we, I get it. We D.

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.520
I get it because like Eddie, but we.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.520
Also, I'm really gay.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.520
That was Rob.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.520
Loki, your final thought. What are you shopping for on eBay right now?

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:15.520
Analog replacement for my new PSP that I'm going to be getting since I want it repaired by Wednesday.

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.520
My final thought is.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:21.520
God, I wish Crackdown was out this week, but I have to wait another week.

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.520
Boo.

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.520
My final thought is reject false icons and.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.520
Stealing my life.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.520
I heart you, Jamie.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.520
Bah.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.520
Jamie, your final thought.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.520
Bundle of blood.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.520
And my other obsession right now is Captain America.

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:42.520
Have a great night everybody. We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.520
Bye.
