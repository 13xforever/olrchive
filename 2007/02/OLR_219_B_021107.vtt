01:24.400 --> 01:25.981
[SPEAKER_07]: But DarkSakura is going to rescue us.

01:26.041 --> 01:26.921
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame you.

01:27.241 --> 01:29.162
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is going to rescue us with some gaming news.

01:29.342 --> 01:29.922
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to.

01:30.182 --> 01:30.662
[SPEAKER_07]: You must.

01:31.282 --> 01:31.502
[SPEAKER_07]: Help.

01:31.822 --> 01:33.003
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how about this?

01:33.063 --> 01:34.183
[SPEAKER_02]: It's movie news.

01:34.443 --> 01:35.324
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that works.

01:36.004 --> 01:38.445
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as it's not Uwe Boll.

01:38.625 --> 01:39.825
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

01:41.185 --> 01:43.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's going to be one of those shows tonight.

01:43.926 --> 01:44.166
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

01:45.027 --> 01:45.267
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:45.427 --> 01:45.627
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

01:46.567 --> 01:46.847
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:48.688 --> 01:48.808
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

01:51.233 --> 01:51.653
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.

01:52.674 --> 01:53.474
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, my show now.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.835
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're listening to Jamie Lounge Radio.

01:56.015 --> 01:56.175
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:57.115 --> 01:57.735
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that?

01:57.795 --> 01:59.876
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the sound of a thousand people unsubscribing.

01:59.916 --> 02:00.316
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

02:00.576 --> 02:00.996
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

02:01.016 --> 02:03.477
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the sound of my finger raised in tribute to you.

02:03.697 --> 02:04.438
[SPEAKER_07]: Video game news.

02:04.478 --> 02:05.678
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we ever do it on this program?

02:05.738 --> 02:08.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony is making a Metal Gear movie.

02:09.539 --> 02:13.901
[SPEAKER_02]: Produced by, was it the one who's producing the Ghost Rider movie?

02:15.447 --> 02:16.647
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very cool stuff.

02:17.188 --> 02:22.210
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was actually announced by Studio Kojima at last E3.

02:23.170 --> 02:38.336
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, as far as what's been quoted, is that it's going to be a very... Okay, this makes no sense.

02:42.577 --> 02:44.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're talking about...

02:44.873 --> 02:46.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, whatever.

02:46.174 --> 02:46.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make me feel worse.

02:47.014 --> 02:47.154
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

03:15.781 --> 03:18.403
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm actually voting for the write-in sequel.

03:19.764 --> 03:20.785
[SPEAKER_07]: The write-in sequel?

03:20.925 --> 03:21.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

03:22.466 --> 03:22.686
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

03:23.207 --> 03:23.787
[SPEAKER_07]: UFO ending?

03:23.887 --> 03:24.107
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

03:25.849 --> 03:26.149
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

03:27.510 --> 03:28.030
[SPEAKER_07]: Dog ending?

03:28.111 --> 03:32.054
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's the Silent Hill movie, not Metal Gear.

03:34.175 --> 03:39.780
[SPEAKER_12]: So does that mean we're going to speculate about who's going to be playing all of the roles in the movie?

03:41.348 --> 03:47.412
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Garsh, Rice Princess, if you were to cast the Metal Gear Solid movie, who would you cast in the role of Snake?

03:49.293 --> 03:49.853
[SPEAKER_12]: A snake?

03:51.874 --> 03:58.738
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I would cast, um... Dude, why can I not be... Matt Damon, because he plays everybody.

03:58.938 --> 03:59.639
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Ben Affleck.

03:59.899 --> 04:00.799
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt Damon!

04:02.080 --> 04:08.664
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben Affleck, because apparently people think that he's such a universal actor that he can play any role ever.

04:08.684 --> 04:08.904
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

04:10.045 --> 04:11.486
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know who I want it to be.

04:11.926 --> 04:13.246
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy who's his voice actor.

04:13.926 --> 04:14.567
[SPEAKER_07]: David Tennant?

04:14.987 --> 04:15.727
[SPEAKER_02]: No, David Hader.

04:17.028 --> 04:17.168
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah.

04:18.348 --> 04:21.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, I'm pulling up pictures of him and he's actually really cute.

04:21.709 --> 04:23.330
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would actually make a good snake.

04:23.990 --> 04:24.570
[SPEAKER_02]: See, here he is.

04:26.571 --> 04:29.312
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as Loki plays... I'm going to send it to the chat room.

04:29.612 --> 04:31.812
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as Loki plays the role of Tingle.

04:32.353 --> 04:34.093
[SPEAKER_07]: That's according to GS68.

04:35.154 --> 04:36.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, because keep in mind...

04:37.732 --> 04:42.894
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, David Hayter wrote the first two X-Men movies, but he was also Solid Snake's voice actor.

04:42.934 --> 04:46.255
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, he's pretty freaking... He looks kind of like Snake, too.

04:46.796 --> 04:48.056
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Janai wins.

04:48.116 --> 04:50.777
[SPEAKER_07]: He says Paul Reubens should play Snake.

04:50.797 --> 04:58.580
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, apparently it's a Hollywood reporter saying that Columbia Pictures is now currently negotiating the rights to Metal Gear Solid.

04:58.740 --> 05:03.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbia is owned by Sony, so not a big surprise there.

05:04.302 --> 05:04.542
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

05:05.577 --> 05:14.360
[SPEAKER_05]: What is kind of a big surprise though is Rockstar's brand new game Manhunt 2 is coming to the Wii as well as PlayStation 2 and PSP.

05:15.040 --> 05:33.026
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who didn't play Manhunt 1, in Manhunt you actually play a psychopathic killer who is basically egged on to kill people in very violent ways using everything from trash bags to shards of glass and

05:34.073 --> 05:37.294
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess we will actually get a murder simulator.

05:37.614 --> 05:37.954
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

05:38.194 --> 05:40.254
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is awesome, and it's going to be very violent.

05:40.314 --> 05:42.615
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, so you can use a trash bag to kill someone?

05:42.655 --> 05:46.356
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and it's great because you can use... Let's demonstrate in studio how that's done.

05:46.796 --> 05:48.576
[SPEAKER_07]: Irene, if you would just sit still for a minute.

05:51.997 --> 05:53.197
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

05:53.217 --> 05:56.578
[SPEAKER_07]: We here at Orange Launch Radio do not endorse the actual killing of actual people.

05:56.778 --> 05:59.759
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, this got announced on February 6th.

06:01.061 --> 06:17.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Which just so happened, ironically enough, and I'm sure this is just pure coincidence, happened to be the anniversary of apparently a murder that was sought to be blamed on the original Manhunt game, apparently.

06:19.585 --> 06:25.986
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a 2004 incident where a kid, Steven, I don't even...

06:26.513 --> 06:31.094
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, age 14, was murdered by his friend, Warren LeBlanc, age 17.

06:32.434 --> 06:38.395
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, they blamed the actions on the game, which was later disproved in court.

06:38.615 --> 06:43.336
[SPEAKER_05]: But parents, either way, are still kind of pissed off that they made this announcement on the anniversary of that.

06:45.256 --> 06:45.816
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

06:46.196 --> 06:46.936
[SPEAKER_05]: More murder game!

06:47.197 --> 06:47.817
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this.

06:47.977 --> 06:49.257
[SPEAKER_05]: And fuck those parents.

06:49.277 --> 06:51.697
[SPEAKER_05]: Those parents are just jealous that they didn't make it first.

06:52.157 --> 06:52.877
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know what?

06:53.718 --> 06:54.678
[SPEAKER_05]: Manhunt 2, hell yes.

06:55.578 --> 06:55.838
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

06:56.861 --> 07:21.108
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize if I mispronounce this name Kai Hate Wireless says Manhunt 2 will get Wii recalls at Walmarts and Targets nationwide Mike W says murder games suck Raven's Dolphin says Manhunt for the Wii for the win FTW well we shall see is Manhunt 2 a game that interests you?

07:22.213 --> 07:32.395
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, because you said earlier in the program you want games with more blood and more violence, and I don't know, killing people with a trash bag with your Wiimote, that's... I think that that would be a very interesting... Is that a game that appeals to women?

07:32.695 --> 07:36.576
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it should be Ultimate PMS Revenge, the game.

07:38.877 --> 07:39.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

07:39.577 --> 07:42.257
[SPEAKER_05]: She just doesn't like the title because it has man in it.

07:42.778 --> 07:46.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, because that could also be women taking revenge off of male oppression.

07:46.718 --> 07:48.039
[SPEAKER_07]: What if they called it ManCunt?

07:48.139 --> 07:49.499
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that appeal to you, then?

07:49.844 --> 07:53.166
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because then I'd start thinking of someone who's pre-op transgendered or something.

07:53.566 --> 07:54.827
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, I just threw up in my mouth.

07:59.009 --> 08:03.531
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's switch topics to a Zorro game on the way to the Wii.

08:03.991 --> 08:09.394
[SPEAKER_07]: Pronto Games is going to be bringing the destiny of Zorro to the Wii this holiday season.

08:10.255 --> 08:12.736
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was announced by Pronto Games.

08:12.996 --> 08:18.299
[SPEAKER_07]: Pronto president and creative director Randy Engel said they hope to bring the player, quote,

08:18.649 --> 08:20.450
[SPEAKER_07]: Fully into the moment of Zorro-ness.

08:20.950 --> 08:23.291
[SPEAKER_07]: And this game is currently planned as a Wii exclusive.

08:23.331 --> 08:25.673
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, I swear to God, that's a quote.

08:25.993 --> 08:27.514
[SPEAKER_07]: Fully into the moment of Zorro-ness.

08:27.534 --> 08:28.674
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, you have killed Irene.

08:28.734 --> 08:29.695
[SPEAKER_01]: She is laughing to death.

08:29.715 --> 08:30.755
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it says.

08:31.416 --> 08:33.136
[SPEAKER_07]: What would that be, like the 1920s?

08:33.377 --> 08:40.640
[SPEAKER_07]: You all know that with that Wiimote, you're going to have to do that stupid make a Z with your Wiimote.

08:40.940 --> 08:43.722
[SPEAKER_07]: How many times in the game do you think you're going to be required to go

08:46.309 --> 08:47.669
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's the only point of the game.

08:47.689 --> 08:48.330
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what you do.

08:48.350 --> 08:55.373
[SPEAKER_07]: The objective is you try to make the Z. That's the game, and that's how you fully embrace the Zoroness.

08:55.514 --> 09:04.118
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and at the same time, you can fully embrace the Zeroness for buying the game.

09:05.079 --> 09:06.740
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they call him the Gay Blade.

09:08.621 --> 09:09.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

09:11.282 --> 09:12.983
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ... It's a new Zoro...

09:14.159 --> 09:16.661
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Janai says, Zo, really?

09:21.425 --> 09:22.206
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like this, Rob.

09:22.266 --> 09:26.990
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's like... Three snaps in Z formation?

09:27.270 --> 09:30.112
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Loki just do three snaps in Z formation?

09:30.132 --> 09:30.533
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that he did.

09:30.993 --> 09:33.135
[SPEAKER_01]: Flash, flash, flash with the girl.

09:33.815 --> 09:37.278
[SPEAKER_07]: I give this game two snaps, a twist, and a kiss.

09:41.334 --> 09:43.635
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the single gayest show we've ever done.

09:43.655 --> 09:48.897
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so gay that they'll be downloading rainbows.

09:48.977 --> 09:56.080
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, if you are listening for the first time and you're like, that's wrong.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.561
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to call GLAAD on these people.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.702
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of us are gay, so it's okay that we make these jokes.

10:01.422 --> 10:03.343
[SPEAKER_07]: Me being one of them, Eddie the gay being the other.

10:05.464 --> 10:07.084
[SPEAKER_07]: Casper the gay, Eddie the gay, whatever.

10:07.104 --> 10:07.584
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gay.

10:08.085 --> 10:08.765
[SPEAKER_07]: Gay the gay.

10:09.457 --> 10:13.218
[SPEAKER_07]: Gay, the gayest gay that ever gayed with his gay blade on the Zorro Gay Game.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, DT said I just won the internet.

10:15.219 --> 10:15.939
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for Rob.

10:16.760 --> 10:20.961
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, when I ever eat breakfast, I poop out the internet, so don't worry about that.

10:21.742 --> 10:22.962
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you mastered your gay blade?

10:25.543 --> 10:27.584
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob has the gay blade, and he bought it at Disneyland.

10:29.064 --> 10:30.585
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back to video game news, shall we?

10:31.845 --> 10:35.887
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we lose... Tonight, it's how many subscribers can we lose?

10:37.147 --> 10:38.728
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of gay, I'm sorry.

10:39.535 --> 10:40.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Transformers.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.396
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some news about Transformers?

10:43.056 --> 10:48.758
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Transformers game being put out by Activision on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PS2, and PC.

10:49.038 --> 10:51.159
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of Ps trying to say that five times fast.

10:53.700 --> 11:02.323
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we have the PSP and DS versions that are going to be handled by Savage and Vicarious Visions.

11:02.343 --> 11:04.404
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, they're going to be handled by a Savage?

11:05.043 --> 11:07.144
[SPEAKER_02]: The Transformers are being handled, you know.

11:07.764 --> 11:13.146
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured if we could have a transforming tape deck, we could have a vibrator Transformer, I don't know.

11:14.006 --> 11:18.827
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will get me to another topic today, because I actually looked at the Transformers movie poster today and about cried.

11:20.048 --> 11:22.889
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's actually being handled by Randy Macho Man Savage.

11:22.909 --> 11:24.489
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes!

11:24.649 --> 11:25.810
[SPEAKER_07]: Never do a Transformer!

11:27.550 --> 11:28.571
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awful!

11:28.991 --> 11:32.092
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that he plays, you know that he plays Space Ghost's grandfather?

11:32.192 --> 11:32.812
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes!

11:33.311 --> 11:34.912
[SPEAKER_02]: on Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

11:34.992 --> 11:38.193
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll actually be doing the rest of the night as Randy Macho Man Savage.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.034
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah!

11:39.434 --> 11:41.054
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, no, Rob.

11:41.215 --> 11:41.875
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no!

11:41.895 --> 11:43.035
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no!

11:43.576 --> 11:45.516
[SPEAKER_02]: Naughty, naughty, cool aide.

11:45.757 --> 11:47.637
[SPEAKER_12]: So when are you going to start, Rob?

11:47.657 --> 11:49.038
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's awful.

11:51.299 --> 11:52.960
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about Transformers game, huh?

11:53.340 --> 11:53.540
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

11:54.561 --> 12:08.894
[SPEAKER_02]: The Transformers game you'll be able to either play as an Autobot or Decepticon, and you would have to master each character's weapon moves, transformations, and you'd have to be able to switch between the vehicle and robot mode.

12:10.455 --> 12:14.138
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tear up the world around you, you can smash shit, and you can blow shit up.

12:14.899 --> 12:16.540
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes it an awesome game already.

12:18.582 --> 12:19.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Traveler's Tales...

12:20.965 --> 12:26.188
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I believe that they are the ones releasing it.

12:26.688 --> 12:28.469
[SPEAKER_02]: They also had that Lego Star Wars game.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.572
[SPEAKER_05]: And also had that stupid Bionicle game as well.

12:33.932 --> 12:35.193
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Lego Star Wars game was fun.

12:35.233 --> 12:37.354
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps Lego Transformers?

12:40.095 --> 12:44.197
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but I freaking saw that poster today and wanted to cry again.

12:44.217 --> 12:46.679
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am going to see Ghost Rider.

12:48.339 --> 12:48.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways...

12:50.007 --> 12:55.431
[SPEAKER_05]: So the PSP, they just updated the firmware from 3.10 to 3.11.

12:56.372 --> 13:04.859
[SPEAKER_05]: Adding brand new functionality like a fix to some of the R-Type games and a reset button for the emulator.

13:05.860 --> 13:14.987
[SPEAKER_05]: And, well, as you might have guessed, as soon as they got it released out there to the world, it was cracked and broken apart and...

13:15.799 --> 13:19.841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yet another firmware that's been released by Sony and cracked the same day.

13:21.162 --> 13:27.225
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hooray, your attempts at foiling homebrew have failed yet again.

13:28.045 --> 13:28.725
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even care.

13:29.105 --> 13:30.486
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you say that this is version 3.1.1?

13:30.726 --> 13:30.486
3.1.1.

13:30.826 --> 13:39.030
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that song.

13:41.712 --> 13:44.153
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone cracked our system, down, down.

13:45.299 --> 13:47.000
[SPEAKER_07]: They took it down, down, down, down.

13:48.161 --> 13:48.441
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

13:49.842 --> 13:50.162
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

13:50.203 --> 13:54.926
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those shows.

13:54.946 --> 13:57.828
[SPEAKER_05]: 3-1-1, the last three reviews that we've had on the station.

13:58.788 --> 14:02.251
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the show we're submitting to the podcast Emmys, by the way, just so you know.

14:04.032 --> 14:06.534
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote for us on Dig and Podcast Alley.

14:07.535 --> 14:08.936
[SPEAKER_07]: And tell them you loved episode 219.

14:08.976 --> 14:09.016
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

14:14.545 --> 14:16.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, Will Wheaton.

14:16.986 --> 14:17.847
[SPEAKER_07]: Who can save a show?

14:17.867 --> 14:18.867
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Will Wheaton.

14:18.887 --> 14:20.268
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't love Will Wheaton?

14:20.788 --> 14:22.229
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, Will Wheaton is awesome.

14:22.549 --> 14:28.212
[SPEAKER_07]: Will Wheaton blogged this week on SuicideGirls.com and he was blogging about the arcades.

14:29.053 --> 14:30.033
[SPEAKER_07]: I urge you to check this out.

14:30.093 --> 14:31.554
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of those reminiscing posts.

14:31.854 --> 14:36.097
[SPEAKER_07]: He's talking about how he loves the arcades and he loved the arcades back in the 80s.

14:36.457 --> 14:38.898
[SPEAKER_07]: He asked himself, what happens to the arcades?

14:39.218 --> 14:44.181
[SPEAKER_07]: And he talks about, well, he thinks that because of PC gaming and I can spend 40 bucks to play a game at home.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you spend a dollar on a game now?

14:46.401 --> 14:50.923
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I thought was most interesting about this is his perspective on what should they do.

14:51.543 --> 15:04.449
[SPEAKER_07]: And he thought in the last paragraph of his statement here, he thinks that some billionaire should come out and open a chain of classic 1980 videos arcades, complete with the Journey game and Rush on the Jukebox.

15:05.429 --> 15:07.450
[SPEAKER_07]: More reasons why I love Wil Wheaton, by the way.

15:07.710 --> 15:08.050
[SPEAKER_07]: Love him.

15:08.611 --> 15:11.612
[SPEAKER_07]: And that you get five tokens for a dollar.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.197
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, and he says, why not?

15:13.417 --> 15:19.799
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a resurgence of 50s diners in the 80s, so why not a resurgence of classic 80s arcades in the new millennium?

15:20.079 --> 15:20.479
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

15:20.519 --> 15:25.120
[SPEAKER_07]: If they opened up like a classic 80s arcade, would you go and would you patronize it?

15:25.780 --> 15:27.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or I could play MAME in my garage.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.401
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if they had the Journey game, I wouldn't.

15:32.401 --> 15:34.161
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be camped out in front of the machine all day.

15:34.181 --> 15:35.142
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have the high score.

15:35.222 --> 15:36.862
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the Journey game is awesome.

15:37.583 --> 15:38.504
[SPEAKER_02]: The Journey game is awesome.

15:38.824 --> 15:39.565
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

15:39.945 --> 15:42.627
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where you get to play that is at Classic Gaming Expo.

15:43.087 --> 15:44.948
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to have, like, food there, too, though.

15:45.049 --> 15:49.512
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have to be, like, old-school Chuck E. Cheese, you know, back... Isn't that kind of what Dave & Buster's is, though?

15:50.032 --> 15:50.853
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of, yeah.

15:51.393 --> 15:51.673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

15:51.793 --> 15:53.615
[SPEAKER_05]: But Dave & Buster's is way damn expensive.

15:53.655 --> 16:01.661
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they have just way too many ticket games there that cost way too much to win prizes that are, you know, okay, more expensive, but still they have to spend more money.

16:01.901 --> 16:03.062
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

16:03.302 --> 16:05.003
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I have to set the mood here a little bit.

16:08.377 --> 16:09.698
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, this shit takes me back.

16:11.799 --> 16:13.920
[SPEAKER_07]: To the days of Asteroids and Ms.

16:13.980 --> 16:14.601
[SPEAKER_07]: Pac-Man.

16:16.162 --> 16:21.925
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine walking into an arcade and you got Journey blasting on the... Man, this takes me back.

16:24.726 --> 16:25.847
[SPEAKER_07]: You love this song, you know it.

16:25.987 --> 16:27.608
[SPEAKER_07]: You just don't want to admit it, right, Princess?

16:28.909 --> 16:29.189
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

16:31.178 --> 16:33.980
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've welcomed Will Wheaton's opinion onto the program.

16:34.020 --> 16:35.041
[SPEAKER_07]: How about your opinion?

16:35.321 --> 16:39.464
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys send us emails every week to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

16:39.924 --> 16:42.166
[SPEAKER_07]: And last week we complained we didn't get enough emails.

16:42.326 --> 16:44.728
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we actually got quite a few more emails this week.

16:44.748 --> 16:45.949
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're very proud of the listeners.

16:46.989 --> 16:48.270
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope we get more next week.

16:48.290 --> 16:49.811
[SPEAKER_07]: So mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

16:49.831 --> 16:50.752
[SPEAKER_02]: You hope we get more.

16:50.952 --> 16:54.195
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get Dark Sakura to open up the mailbag and read some emails.

16:54.215 --> 16:57.417
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.040
[SPEAKER_02]: Email, email, email.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Checking the email.

17:04.862 --> 17:09.385
[SPEAKER_02]: First one comes from Apollo Chan saying, Hey there, DarkSakura.

17:09.425 --> 17:10.246
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's to me.

17:10.386 --> 17:10.666
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

17:11.346 --> 17:13.308
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope all is well with you and the rest of the crew.

17:13.408 --> 17:17.690
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious if you or any of the other members of the OLR crew happen to have a Facebook account.

17:18.451 --> 17:23.014
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are not familiar with Facebook, think MySpace except less tacky and more respectable atmosphere.

17:23.715 --> 17:27.057
[SPEAKER_02]: It began as a university-only networking site, but now it's open to everyone.

17:27.537 --> 17:31.038
[SPEAKER_02]: If you all are not members, I would like to suggest that you at least give it a look.

17:31.098 --> 17:34.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's an OLR Facebook group called Orange Jones Radio Fans, the OLR Army.

17:35.586 --> 17:39.728
[SPEAKER_02]: That I started a while ago and I just thought it might be good to let you all know in case you weren't aware.

17:40.128 --> 17:41.529
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you could better promote it.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.970
[SPEAKER_02]: Just another vessel for spreading the OLR gospel.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Love, love, love the show.

17:45.871 --> 17:48.873
[SPEAKER_02]: You all make me amazingly happy, so keep up the good work and have a great week.

17:48.993 --> 17:49.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Apollo.

17:49.633 --> 17:49.973
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

17:50.534 --> 17:54.096
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you all will be talking about the 2DX testing in Illinois on next week's show.

17:54.176 --> 17:55.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that super exciting?

17:56.097 --> 17:56.497
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

17:56.537 --> 17:58.598
[SPEAKER_07]: You listened to part A. I'm excited.

17:59.478 --> 18:00.539
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think it's going to...

18:02.282 --> 18:03.562
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:22.481 --> 18:23.883
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

18:41.932 --> 18:50.154
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it's kind of like Myspace without the page customization and all that weird stuff that brings Myspace to a strange level.

18:50.415 --> 18:53.215
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I think is really interesting is that you update people of your status.

18:53.656 --> 18:58.397
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, for those of you that remember Jonas, aka Explicit, that came onto this program, he's on my friends page.

18:58.797 --> 19:01.498
[SPEAKER_07]: And it told me last night, Jonas is out at a party.

19:01.838 --> 19:05.059
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, wow, that's amazing that the internet tells me these things.

19:05.946 --> 19:07.127
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing what the internet has accomplished.

19:07.147 --> 19:13.790
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's awesome that somebody else created this community and that people were already joining it before we even got an email on it.

19:13.830 --> 19:16.011
[SPEAKER_07]: So big hug and kisses to you guys out there.

19:16.671 --> 19:21.694
[SPEAKER_02]: Our next email actually comes from, let me see, from Stacy.

19:22.509 --> 19:27.871
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, I've been listening to the Orange Lounge station for about a week now, and I have a question about the playlist.

19:27.931 --> 19:32.132
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that the majority of the songs are from DDR or Beatmania or from other similar games.

19:32.152 --> 19:35.733
[SPEAKER_02]: There were very few, very, very few songs that weren't dance, Eurobeat, etc.

19:36.093 --> 19:40.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it advertised as a station dedicated to video games when it's so biased toward dance-type games?

19:40.775 --> 19:48.817
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I read on the site, I understand that it started out as being a tribute to those kinds of games, but now, aside from the shows, there's very little to distinguish it from the typical dance station.

19:49.137 --> 19:52.098
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this sounds like an attack, it really is, and I'm generally curious about this.

19:52.711 --> 19:54.852
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just haven't filtered out a lot of the old stuff.

19:55.713 --> 19:57.974
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the majority of the stuff because they were all there before.

19:58.114 --> 20:07.178
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, well, we did do a pretty big reshuffle when we went to MP3 Pro about a year and a half ago, but I think that's what's been high-rated.

20:07.238 --> 20:15.723
[SPEAKER_07]: There are other places out there where you can hear just regular gaming music, but I find that a lot of the orchestral gaming music can kind of be like,

20:17.157 --> 20:21.319
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that it's bad or anything, but without the game there, it doesn't make for the most entertaining radio.

20:21.399 --> 20:32.083
[SPEAKER_07]: So we try to keep the music that's in our rotation upbeat a little more, but certainly it could use some help in getting the music buffed up with some other picks that are very upbeat.

20:32.123 --> 20:34.904
[SPEAKER_07]: So certainly we welcome your suggestions on music we could add to the stream.

20:34.964 --> 20:37.184
[SPEAKER_02]: The really bizarre stuff was from me, by the way.

20:38.365 --> 20:44.007
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, though, we still feel justified in calling ourselves radio dedicated to video gaming because of,

20:44.500 --> 20:45.320
[SPEAKER_07]: Xenia on the ELDDR

21:17.591 --> 21:18.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, LLR.

21:18.231 --> 21:23.074
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first time writing, and first of all, I want to say that your show is awesome and continue the good work.

21:23.474 --> 21:23.934
[SPEAKER_02]: Smiley.

21:24.795 --> 21:29.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the reason I am writing is because I have a question on a certain Konami game that has piqued my interest as of late.

21:30.338 --> 21:39.604
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming if Konami's Oz will ever be released in America, I know that the game is about a year and a half old, but I've seen a YouTube video with an English-dubbed French, I think, text version of the game.

21:40.228 --> 21:40.969
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

22:04.232 --> 22:08.175
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always wanted to try out pop and music and other 2DX games besides the English one I own.

22:08.435 --> 22:08.935
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.

22:09.015 --> 22:09.415
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

22:10.096 --> 22:13.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you can help me out and thank you for taking the time to read this email.

22:13.238 --> 22:14.058
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, your show rules.

22:15.199 --> 22:15.479
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.742
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really big freaking long run up.

22:18.762 --> 22:21.463
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to poke or anything.

22:21.563 --> 22:23.725
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why no one emails us, DarkSakura.

22:24.285 --> 22:25.426
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me when I can take a breath.

22:25.706 --> 22:27.767
[SPEAKER_07]: Oz on PlayStation 2 is not going to come out in this country.

22:28.248 --> 22:33.211
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think there's a lot that can be done at this point because PlayStation 2 is slowly being phased out.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.600
[SPEAKER_07]: So unfortunately you're probably going to have to import that one.

22:37.361 --> 22:42.502
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think it's ever a bad idea to certainly petition the game makers for the games you want to see.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.942
[SPEAKER_07]: Send emails, let them know.

22:46.643 --> 22:52.764
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a company like Konami, they're somewhat out there reading some of the stuff out there on the internet.

22:52.804 --> 22:56.225
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not saying you should go on a board and bitch about it, but send emails, they do care.

22:56.945 --> 22:59.885
[SPEAKER_07]: And that goes with any gaming company, not just Konami, any gaming company.

23:00.625 --> 23:03.086
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them know you want to see it here.

23:04.946 --> 23:13.833
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the next one is actually a link that was sent to us by JeremyTodd1, which I think is actually pretty cool.

23:15.454 --> 23:20.238
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the folks at Xbox Magazine used me's for the staff picture.

23:21.319 --> 23:24.101
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were doing their nod toward Nintendo.

23:24.241 --> 23:33.589
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually is... If you go to gonintendo.com slash wp-content slash photos slash xbox

23:34.449 --> 23:36.230
[SPEAKER_02]: M-I-I-O-X-M.JPG

23:55.090 --> 23:57.313
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the sudden appearance of me's in the magazine?

23:57.353 --> 24:03.381
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that just furthering that odd affection that Microsoft has for Nintendo right now?

24:03.802 --> 24:06.165
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted to recreate pictures of themselves.

24:07.126 --> 24:10.731
[SPEAKER_07]: But using your competitors, because essentially Nintendo is still their competitor.

24:12.230 --> 24:20.633
[SPEAKER_07]: because even though Microsoft might have somehow embraced this Wii 60, I mean, it's odd because you see, like, Major Nelson says nice things about the Wii in his blog.

24:20.973 --> 24:25.234
[SPEAKER_07]: Trixie, I've read her thing on Xbox.com, she said nice things about the Wii one point.

24:25.274 --> 24:30.956
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's kind of like Microsoft kind of has this professional respect for the Wii, but that doesn't seem to be reciprocated by Nintendo.

24:31.016 --> 24:38.539
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there might be a respect, but Reggie has flat out said, don't buy a 360, buy more Wii games, you know, essentially, in so many words.

24:38.919 --> 24:41.200
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just kind of interesting that Microsoft keeps...

24:41.860 --> 24:45.381
[SPEAKER_07]: handing these olive branches over to Nintendo.

24:45.401 --> 24:46.861
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, hey, let's fight Sony together.

24:49.162 --> 24:50.602
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.

24:52.522 --> 24:55.843
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that maybe they're just trying to screw with the consumer's heads.

24:55.923 --> 24:58.984
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 in our chatroom says, come on, Reggie, make love, not war.

25:00.204 --> 25:02.724
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about the next email, huh?

25:02.804 --> 25:03.344
[SPEAKER_07]: How about it?

25:05.245 --> 25:10.386
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear OLR, hi guys, DDR Dollar Bill here, and probably changing my name in the future, long story.

25:11.124 --> 25:13.604
[SPEAKER_02]: and Spirit as long as I'm not going to be in the chatroom on Sunday.

25:13.664 --> 25:18.005
[SPEAKER_02]: My crazy self is in Vegas doing some partying with my family and probably a few hundred crazies.

25:18.145 --> 25:18.465
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.306
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have one thing I'd like to ask.

25:22.146 --> 25:26.647
[SPEAKER_02]: While I was making my pre-reserve for DDR Universe, I had a glance at the future release's date list.

25:27.127 --> 25:28.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Even took home a copy.

25:28.307 --> 25:29.787
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps knowing friends at GameStop.

25:30.107 --> 25:31.247
[SPEAKER_02]: And so did Guitar Hero 2.

25:31.367 --> 25:38.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know this is most likely will be a port of the PS2, but we had a discussion about the rumor of Guitar Hero having a future release of all 80 songs.

25:38.909 --> 25:40.389
[SPEAKER_02]: True or not, it did get me thinking.

25:41.101 --> 25:45.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Would having music games concentrate on certain genre make them more appealing to the mass market?

25:45.882 --> 25:50.123
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it also make it more interesting for those already addicted to the games themselves?

25:50.483 --> 25:51.563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just my thought of the week.

25:51.744 --> 25:53.644
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, there's my two dollars to the show.

25:54.064 --> 25:56.765
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you all have fun, and it goes to the chatroom buddies as well.

25:56.905 --> 25:57.605
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR dollar bill.

25:57.785 --> 25:58.025
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

25:59.145 --> 26:00.586
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't make them appeal to more people.

26:00.626 --> 26:00.926
[SPEAKER_05]: Know why?

26:01.026 --> 26:02.386
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems to be working for karaoke revolution.

26:02.966 --> 26:03.326
[SPEAKER_05]: Country.

26:03.486 --> 26:03.966
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it sucked.

26:04.607 --> 26:05.527
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was pretty cool.

26:05.567 --> 26:06.987
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it, and I don't even like country music.

26:08.127 --> 26:08.547
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awful.

26:09.588 --> 26:10.068
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.

26:10.168 --> 26:10.768
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good game.

26:11.365 --> 26:16.847
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, I have a huge distaste for country music.

26:17.467 --> 26:27.651
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say in response to the Guitar Hero 80 songs thing, an emphasis on rumor is that some of the downloadable packs will have some of the Guitar Hero 1 songs in them.

26:28.071 --> 26:38.795
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll bet you 10 to 1, you would have an easier time seeing the indie label stuff crossover than you would the major label stuff crossover because they're going to have to re-license and all that stuff.

26:38.835 --> 26:40.096
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they would have to.

26:40.675 --> 26:40.775
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

27:03.206 --> 27:07.028
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought an Xbox 360 some months ago and my roommate bought a Wii at launch.

27:07.448 --> 27:17.952
[SPEAKER_02]: We love many of the games on the systems, but I think that it's time I bought myself a good gaming PC to play some games that I've never been able to play before and I have decided to go with Commodore 64.

27:18.852 --> 27:19.833
[SPEAKER_07]: You win the internet.

27:19.893 --> 27:20.433
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this?

27:20.593 --> 27:21.393
[SPEAKER_07]: You win the internet.

27:21.833 --> 27:22.193
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see.

27:22.474 --> 27:29.216
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand you know a bit about that particular machine and I was wondering if there's anything you recommend I look for when going out and buying one.

27:29.516 --> 27:30.097
[SPEAKER_07]: Kickstart.

27:30.237 --> 27:31.177
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure it works.

27:32.182 --> 27:37.427
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there particular cables and things that I need to make sure I get or particular accessories or games that you recommend I look for?

27:37.967 --> 27:50.818
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about how all of the current next-gen consoles offer extra features like media playback and news and weather channels and I realized that the C64 can be used as a musical instrument so it's a good contender for my next game platform.

27:51.158 --> 27:51.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks in advance.

27:52.099 --> 27:54.061
[SPEAKER_02]: Regards, WarriorBob.

27:55.209 --> 27:56.510
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, you rock, Warrior Bob.

27:56.930 --> 28:00.212
[SPEAKER_07]: You can hook up a Commodore 64 to a television.

28:00.592 --> 28:01.252
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to remember.

28:01.272 --> 28:01.893
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been so long.

28:02.013 --> 28:02.913
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had a monitor.

28:03.013 --> 28:06.835
[SPEAKER_07]: I never hooked up the Commodore 64 to a TV, but I seem to remember the hookups were very similar.

28:07.135 --> 28:10.217
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the video component was almost the exact same between the two.

28:10.637 --> 28:14.519
[SPEAKER_07]: So you might need some type of special converter, though, to actually hook it up to a television.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.901
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys have Commodore 64s?

28:17.201 --> 28:18.021
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought Rice Princess did.

28:18.061 --> 28:18.842
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but you know who did?

28:19.102 --> 28:19.302
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?

28:19.522 --> 28:20.142
[SPEAKER_01]: Captain Kirk.

28:20.642 --> 28:21.263
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess.

28:21.883 --> 28:22.123
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

28:22.143 --> 28:22.944
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a Commodore 64, right?

28:24.139 --> 28:25.120
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever hooked up to a TV?

28:26.160 --> 28:26.361
No.

28:26.521 --> 28:27.581
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember if there were special cables?

28:27.721 --> 28:28.442
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

28:29.202 --> 28:30.023
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember either.

28:30.163 --> 28:31.043
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it's been so long.

28:31.364 --> 28:33.025
[SPEAKER_07]: What about games that you remember on the Commodore 64?

28:33.085 --> 28:34.366
[SPEAKER_07]: Impossible Mission.

28:34.826 --> 28:36.507
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, Impossible Mission was awesome.

28:37.284 --> 28:38.645
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that game, The Last Ninja?

28:38.865 --> 28:40.546
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Revenge of the Ninja or something?

28:40.626 --> 28:41.666
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was awesome.

28:41.686 --> 28:42.887
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenge of the Ninja was on the Game Boy.

28:43.667 --> 28:45.228
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's The Last Ninja is what it was called.

28:45.248 --> 28:46.769
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Revenge of the Ninja was on the Sega CD.

28:46.789 --> 28:47.570
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cinematic game.

28:47.830 --> 28:50.271
[SPEAKER_07]: Lazy Jones was a fun game because it was a bunch of mini games.

28:50.431 --> 28:50.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Lode Runner!

28:50.971 --> 28:51.972
[SPEAKER_07]: It's better than Fusion Frenzy.

28:52.252 --> 28:52.872
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember.

28:52.912 --> 28:56.574
[SPEAKER_12]: We had like missions to Mars or something like that or the Mars Zoggers.

28:56.614 --> 28:57.675
[SPEAKER_07]: Pinball Construction Set.

28:58.135 --> 28:59.016
[SPEAKER_07]: That game's awesome too.

28:59.256 --> 29:00.156
[SPEAKER_07]: No, shut up!

29:00.216 --> 29:00.837
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome!

29:02.157 --> 29:03.578
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not require a special monitor.

29:03.598 --> 29:04.499
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be plugged into a TV.

29:05.930 --> 29:08.072
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it says on Wikipedia.

29:08.452 --> 29:12.355
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, though, Kickstart.

29:12.615 --> 29:15.277
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the only game I ever played on the Commodore 64.

29:15.357 --> 29:19.160
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the one with the button and you kick with the little clown and you kick the balloons around the screen?

29:19.180 --> 29:20.882
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a dirt bike racing game.

29:20.942 --> 29:22.343
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to Excitebike.

29:22.363 --> 29:22.663
[SPEAKER_05]: Kickman!

29:23.364 --> 29:24.244
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

29:24.685 --> 29:25.986
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to Excitebike.

29:26.066 --> 29:27.487
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Kickstart.

29:27.707 --> 29:28.267
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta get that game.

29:28.388 --> 29:28.768
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

29:28.788 --> 29:28.928
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

29:29.577 --> 29:31.318
[SPEAKER_07]: Winter Games, Bard's Tale.

29:31.698 --> 29:34.579
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, GameTap has a lot of Commodore 64 games on it.

29:34.599 --> 29:36.780
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to try some out, GameTap has a bunch.

29:37.140 --> 29:39.582
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to find the game that I used to play all the time.

29:39.782 --> 29:45.004
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was Bard's Tale, but I tried to look it up and all the ones that I came up with did not look anything.

29:45.144 --> 29:45.624
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that game?

29:45.644 --> 29:47.125
[SPEAKER_07]: The Seven Scrolls or whatever that game was?

29:47.185 --> 29:50.907
[SPEAKER_12]: No, all I remember is a miasmal cur from the game.

29:50.987 --> 29:52.828
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the only thing that sticks out in my mind.

29:53.308 --> 29:55.929
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck with your Commodore 64 adventures.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.310
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to try GEOS at some point.

29:59.149 --> 30:01.511
[SPEAKER_07]: and see the Commodore 64 as a Mac.

30:02.352 --> 30:03.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.615
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, the Commodore 64 was awesome.

30:06.496 --> 30:07.457
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the Commodore 64.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.358
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a picture on Wikipedia.

30:10.419 --> 30:15.624
[SPEAKER_07]: Just about any arcade game that was out in the early 80s had a port on the Commodore 64.

30:15.884 --> 30:16.344
[SPEAKER_07]: You name it.

30:16.424 --> 30:19.207
[SPEAKER_07]: Donkey Kong, Kongo Bongo, whatever, it's out there.

30:19.487 --> 30:20.588
[SPEAKER_01]: And Captain Kirk did have one.

30:20.988 --> 30:23.230
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a Star Trek game on the Commodore 64, you smartass.

30:23.250 --> 30:25.692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he had one in Star Trek 2.

30:26.293 --> 30:26.533
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

30:27.661 --> 30:28.801
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know what Commodore 64 is.

30:28.841 --> 30:34.825
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I would urge all our listeners at some point this week, because there is a website where you can play Commodore 64 games.

30:34.986 --> 30:37.187
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember what the hell it was.

30:39.709 --> 30:40.669
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe somebody in chat remembers.

30:40.689 --> 30:44.792
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some site that had nothing but Java, Commodore 64 games.

30:44.832 --> 30:46.133
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play a ton of them online.

30:47.974 --> 30:52.678
[SPEAKER_07]: I urge everyone to play one Commodore 64 game this week and check out the roots of PC gaming.

30:53.118 --> 30:54.559
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely make it Impossible Missions.

30:55.276 --> 30:59.039
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so speaking of the Commodore 64, who had a TI-85?

30:59.259 --> 31:05.143
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what they are, but I didn't have one, because we had a Commodore 64, they were better.

31:05.743 --> 31:07.124
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a Coleco, I had an Atom.

31:08.545 --> 31:10.667
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you had an Apple II, I'm sorry.

31:11.427 --> 31:14.169
[SPEAKER_02]: We had one at my school, and I played a lot of kicks, and that was all I cared about.

31:15.510 --> 31:19.313
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody in our chatroom, Camara, says Lemon64.com.

31:19.353 --> 31:22.195
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen this site, this isn't the same site I use, but it looks like this will work.

31:22.850 --> 31:23.510
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you can do this.

31:23.530 --> 31:23.970
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try it.

31:23.990 --> 31:24.771
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that last email?

31:24.811 --> 31:25.511
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:26.471 --> 31:27.992
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes from Cutie Honey.

31:29.173 --> 31:31.213
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got two things to say this time.

31:31.373 --> 31:35.555
[SPEAKER_02]: I recall a comment at the end of the Sunday show where Rob said that the show needs more gay people.

31:36.215 --> 31:39.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess you can count me as the OO Army's first bisexual pleasure to meet you guys.

31:39.877 --> 31:43.318
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you've been, you're beaten to that from show one.

31:44.939 --> 31:45.179
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

31:46.420 --> 31:53.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, on a completely different note, two weeks ago you guys started a discussion about games that have too many sequels and remakes.

31:53.943 --> 31:59.845
[SPEAKER_02]: In chat, I brought up the fact that DDR had many games, and suddenly a ton of people went crazy.

32:00.185 --> 32:01.385
[SPEAKER_02]: A fun kind of crazy, mind you.

32:01.785 --> 32:02.186
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait.

32:02.346 --> 32:03.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Bisexual male or female?

32:04.606 --> 32:04.807
[SPEAKER_02]: Male.

32:05.247 --> 32:05.407
[SPEAKER_07]: Over 18?

32:07.307 --> 32:07.608
[SPEAKER_07]: Single?

32:08.128 --> 32:08.868
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he attach a picture?

32:09.328 --> 32:09.528
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

32:11.309 --> 32:11.729
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

32:12.827 --> 32:15.828
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I finish the email?

32:16.168 --> 32:19.188
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it's Valentine's Day and I'm single.

32:20.069 --> 32:21.309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Valentine's Day.

32:21.969 --> 32:23.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I'm doing on Valentine's Day?

32:23.769 --> 32:24.250
[SPEAKER_07]: Crocheting?

32:24.630 --> 32:26.910
[SPEAKER_02]: Having my neck adjusted and going to school.

32:27.630 --> 32:27.970
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun.

32:28.671 --> 32:29.711
[SPEAKER_02]: How romantic.

32:30.331 --> 32:31.791
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, can I finish reading the email, please?

32:31.811 --> 32:32.291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you may.

32:32.471 --> 32:32.892
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

32:33.752 --> 32:34.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was I?

32:34.592 --> 32:34.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

32:36.743 --> 32:38.124
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the burning question.

32:38.144 --> 32:43.265
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Konami beats a dead horse by releasing several Ben Mani games each year with only different song lists?

32:44.205 --> 32:44.585
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

32:45.726 --> 32:46.666
[SPEAKER_02]: Blame the orange soda for that.

32:47.306 --> 32:58.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm not helping the situation by buying every PS2 DDR game that gets released, it's kind of annoying to see some new features like Battle Mode added when you have to ask yourself, why didn't they add it last year?

32:59.089 --> 33:01.250
[SPEAKER_02]: The cheap rational bastard in me would rather...

33:02.253 --> 33:03.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Honey Fresh Honey Fresh

33:28.826 --> 33:33.288
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think the Bomani games coming out very similar every year with different solos.

33:33.308 --> 33:34.369
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, there's new modes.

33:34.589 --> 33:40.992
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually Konami tries to throw something new in it every time, like whether it be the single-player Mission Master or the Hands and Feet or whatever new thing they did.

33:41.432 --> 33:46.754
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would say it's no different than the Madden 06, 07, 08 games that come out, you know?

33:47.214 --> 33:50.956
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people don't get that, just like some people don't get the DDR games that come out every year.

33:50.996 --> 33:57.459
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just kind of, if you're into that, then you kind of accept that as part of what the games go through each year with the change, so...

33:58.035 --> 33:59.215
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I say.

34:01.056 --> 34:04.317
[SPEAKER_07]: With the new songs come new step charts and new challenges, you know?

34:04.457 --> 34:04.797
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

34:05.658 --> 34:13.180
[SPEAKER_07]: But see, from the other perspective, ask somebody who doesn't play DDR as much as I do, and they probably think, it's stupid, it's the same game every time.

34:13.260 --> 34:19.242
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how some of us, what some of us say about Madden, is that it's roster update 2007.

34:19.562 --> 34:22.043
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, we don't really play those games, so we don't understand.

34:22.563 --> 34:23.704
[SPEAKER_07]: I try not to say that.

34:23.764 --> 34:24.664
[SPEAKER_07]: If I do, it's injustice.

34:25.606 --> 34:30.947
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, in the beginning with DDR, it used to have a lot of significant changes with each one.

34:30.967 --> 34:40.949
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember with 5th Mix, you had the actual tempo freezes, which was like when you first played, you're like, what the fuck?

34:41.429 --> 34:42.349
[SPEAKER_05]: The song stopped!

34:42.589 --> 34:43.749
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone broke the machine!

34:43.849 --> 34:45.549
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it started up again.

34:45.890 --> 34:47.130
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of neat.

34:47.190 --> 34:52.951
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, you had tempo changes in 4th Mix and stuff like that.

34:54.271 --> 34:54.431
[SPEAKER_05]: And

34:54.909 --> 34:56.470
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a hot gay man?

34:56.490 --> 34:57.191
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

34:57.251 --> 34:58.231
[SPEAKER_05]: No hot gay man?

34:58.311 --> 34:59.412
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the last email.

34:59.432 --> 34:59.892
[SPEAKER_05]: But a cool one!

34:59.912 --> 34:59.993
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

35:24.045 --> 35:25.526
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your Facebook address, Rob?

35:26.287 --> 35:27.468
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have addresses on Facebook.

35:27.488 --> 35:31.131
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to look me up by name, but I use my stage name, Rob Roberts, so it's easy to find me on Facebook.

35:31.872 --> 35:32.872
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, you should get a Facebook, too.

35:32.933 --> 35:33.313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of fun.

35:33.333 --> 35:34.134
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's all do that.

35:34.794 --> 35:35.315
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

35:36.556 --> 35:37.456
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got another one, too.

35:37.516 --> 35:37.877
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this.

35:38.097 --> 35:38.797
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm popular.

35:39.298 --> 35:39.758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

35:40.699 --> 35:40.999
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of popular, you know what game is popular out there?

35:45.263 --> 35:46.024
[SPEAKER_05]: Gears of War.

35:46.344 --> 35:50.908
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everyone's got a big heart on over Gears of War, except for me, because I don't really like the game.

35:50.948 --> 35:51.648
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways...

35:53.354 --> 35:58.696
[SPEAKER_05]: It did win eight awards at the 10th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

35:59.196 --> 36:01.856
[SPEAKER_05]: And these aren't like achievement points, but, you know, whatever.

36:02.837 --> 36:11.859
[SPEAKER_05]: It did win a bunch of different awards, including Game of the Year, Best Console Game, Best Animation.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.240
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

36:17.581 --> 36:18.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Among some other ones here.

36:19.021 --> 36:21.842
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Best Outstanding Character Performance of a Male.

36:23.069 --> 36:31.871
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Online Gameplay, Best Visual Engineering, and Action Adventure Game of the Year.

36:34.071 --> 36:34.892
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprise!

36:35.852 --> 36:37.432
[SPEAKER_07]: Gears of War wins more awards.

36:41.773 --> 36:42.053
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

36:42.753 --> 36:43.914
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm actually with Loki.

36:43.934 --> 36:45.634
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eh, I could care less.

36:46.371 --> 36:46.691
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

36:47.272 --> 36:49.333
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Gears of War is a phenomenal game.

36:49.353 --> 36:50.554
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah.

36:50.574 --> 36:52.035
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what everybody on the internet says.

36:52.075 --> 36:52.595
[SPEAKER_05]: It must be true.

36:52.615 --> 37:07.666
[SPEAKER_05]: When Halo 3 comes out this year, and even if it isn't as good as Gears of War, and, you know, it could be like half-ass, you know, half as good as Gears of War or whatever, people will still be giving this thing awards and getting a big boner over this game because it's Halo.

37:08.827 --> 37:09.207
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

37:10.488 --> 37:13.810
[SPEAKER_07]: Gears was okay, but, I mean, just, I don't know.

37:13.830 --> 37:16.092
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't give me the boner it gave the rest of the internet, I guess.

37:16.843 --> 37:20.807
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, this might give a lot of sci-fi fans a boner, though.

37:21.508 --> 37:22.709
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie, get your hand away from me.

37:24.871 --> 37:33.800
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the Hollywood Reporter, NBC Universal, which is part of Vivendi, they are working on a space combat game.

37:33.820 --> 37:34.821
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a sim game.

37:38.266 --> 37:40.506
[SPEAKER_07]: Set in the Battlestar Galactica universe.

37:40.566 --> 37:42.627
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking the new one, not the old one.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.087
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Galaxy Balactica.

37:44.527 --> 37:48.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Digital download for PC and Xbox Live Arcade.

37:49.008 --> 37:56.949
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a tie-in, by the way, with Xbox because there's new Battlestar Galactica gamer picks and themes available for low amounts of Microsoft points.

37:57.009 --> 37:59.230
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the characters going to cry their emo tears?

37:59.850 --> 38:01.310
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Battlestar Galactica is a pretty good show.

38:01.330 --> 38:02.590
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've ever actually watched it.

38:02.630 --> 38:03.430
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually pretty good.

38:04.050 --> 38:05.891
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Krylons, not the Cylons.

38:05.951 --> 38:06.591
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

38:06.611 --> 38:07.471
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop being uneducated.

38:08.095 --> 38:10.798
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it'll be hard for Eddie.

38:10.998 --> 38:11.598
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kidding.

38:12.419 --> 38:14.441
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to seeing what this looks like on Xbox Live.

38:14.481 --> 38:15.041
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet it's fun.

38:15.422 --> 38:17.864
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care about Xbox, but on PC it's going to be awesome.

38:18.344 --> 38:22.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have some news that people might care about, but I don't know, not really.

38:24.450 --> 38:26.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we have friends at Buena Vista Games?

38:26.812 --> 38:34.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least, you know, they've always been really, really great at E3 to work with because when Square says, you can't film that, they're like, here, let me play it while you film it.

38:35.510 --> 38:38.431
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but they have renamed themselves.

38:39.491 --> 38:42.812
[SPEAKER_02]: They are now called Disney Interactive Studios.

38:44.232 --> 38:44.913
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dissed.

38:46.253 --> 38:46.533
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha.

38:47.353 --> 38:51.034
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're officially now making their Disney affiliation public.

38:51.134 --> 38:55.295
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we see Kingdom Hearts and the Disney Interactive Studios, we get it.

38:55.916 --> 39:02.757
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still doing non-Disney games too, to every extent extra, which is one of them.

39:03.838 --> 39:04.658
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are

39:05.638 --> 39:08.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, officially Disney-oriented.

39:08.579 --> 39:12.701
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like Disney presents the M-rated dinosaur-hunting Turok.

39:14.121 --> 39:15.202
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out later this year.

39:15.622 --> 39:16.322
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be interesting.

39:16.362 --> 39:17.342
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney's Turok.

39:17.443 --> 39:19.463
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if we'll have a theme ride based on that.

39:20.284 --> 39:21.224
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should have a crossover.

39:21.284 --> 39:22.104
[SPEAKER_05]: I would so be on that ride.

39:22.124 --> 39:26.386
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Disney owns ABC as well, so we should have a crossover with the characters from Dinosaur.

39:27.046 --> 39:27.746
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the mama!

39:29.687 --> 39:30.067
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

39:30.988 --> 39:32.068
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

39:33.612 --> 39:36.254
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope there's some TGIF fans out there that get my joke.

39:37.195 --> 39:38.836
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I'm going to look stupid as usual.

39:40.016 --> 39:40.957
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

39:41.797 --> 39:43.699
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give it up for 92, y'all!

39:43.719 --> 39:44.999
[SPEAKER_05]: 92 in the house!

39:46.040 --> 39:47.781
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this might make some people happy.

39:48.341 --> 39:54.065
[SPEAKER_05]: Square Enix confirms a brand new MMO coming to 360 and Vista and possibly the PlayStation 3.

39:54.765 --> 39:59.788
[SPEAKER_05]: But whether it's going to be a sequel to Final Fantasy XI, maybe Final Fantasy XIV, eh?

39:59.808 --> 39:59.848
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh?

40:01.343 --> 40:02.443
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XI 2 Final Fantasy XI 2

40:30.523 --> 40:34.666
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to crap my pants in eager anticipation.

40:34.826 --> 40:36.328
[SPEAKER_07]: What if it's Chrono Trigger Online?

40:36.488 --> 40:37.569
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck yeah, I'll play that.

40:37.609 --> 40:38.309
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

40:38.449 --> 40:39.070
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah.

40:39.430 --> 40:41.932
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where I'm really going to crap my pants.

40:42.733 --> 40:43.553
[SPEAKER_12]: Ew, that's kind of gross.

40:44.294 --> 40:44.514
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait.

40:46.055 --> 40:48.837
[SPEAKER_05]: What if it's like Saga Frontier Online?

40:50.198 --> 40:50.639
[SPEAKER_05]: Pass.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.680
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be the only person playing it.

40:52.880 --> 40:53.541
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

40:53.861 --> 40:56.343
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, yes, I can farm all the gold.

40:57.784 --> 40:58.385
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

40:58.785 --> 40:59.386
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, we can move on.

40:59.426 --> 40:59.886
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

41:01.050 --> 41:09.833
[SPEAKER_07]: I would play Final Fantasy XI too, because as much crap as I get Final Fantasy XI now, I did waste two and a half years of my life on it, so there must have been something in that game I saw.

41:09.934 --> 41:13.495
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a good game while it lasted, but I'm in full Final Fantasy XI recovery.

41:19.742 --> 41:20.002
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

41:20.082 --> 41:20.923
[SPEAKER_12]: That's gross.

41:21.003 --> 41:21.123
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

41:21.443 --> 41:22.905
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was actually the people.

41:23.265 --> 41:26.067
[SPEAKER_12]: The over 18 link shell people I had.

41:26.487 --> 41:30.070
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a mighty big link shell here for you.

41:30.330 --> 41:33.853
[SPEAKER_07]: Uni in our chat room is a self-confessed FFXI whore.

41:34.233 --> 41:34.693
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

41:35.414 --> 41:35.754
[SPEAKER_07]: I win.

41:35.814 --> 41:37.555
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent four years, says Uni.

41:38.736 --> 41:39.497
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel your pain.

41:39.717 --> 41:40.297
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel your pain.

41:41.038 --> 41:41.598
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

41:41.678 --> 41:43.240
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever spent real money on gold?

41:45.261 --> 41:46.642
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the point when I knew I had to quit.

41:47.203 --> 41:49.064
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was contemplating spending real money on gold.

41:49.850 --> 41:53.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I'm sorry, that's just a little bit too... That's why I quit!

41:54.173 --> 41:57.635
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I said, you know what, no, that's actually... Good for you, Rob.

41:57.675 --> 42:04.719
[SPEAKER_07]: The other reason why I quit is because when I was sitting there for an hour literally doing nothing, waiting for a party, I was like, I can't take this anymore.

42:05.719 --> 42:07.721
[SPEAKER_01]: Waiting for a pretend party in the game?

42:09.161 --> 42:10.302
[SPEAKER_07]: A panty party!

42:10.742 --> 42:11.643
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome!

42:12.526 --> 42:13.647
[SPEAKER_12]: I miss Ragnarok when I could be leveling.

42:40.034 --> 42:40.675
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow.

42:40.935 --> 42:43.217
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking real quickly since you mentioned buying gold.

42:43.237 --> 42:43.678
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

42:43.918 --> 42:46.661
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone's favorite site to hate, IGE.com.

42:46.881 --> 42:47.141
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

42:47.862 --> 42:54.909
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually have options where you can purchase gold amounts up to 50 million, or at least gil.

42:54.929 --> 42:56.631
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 million gil.

42:56.651 --> 42:57.611
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 million gil, which is $1,563.50.

42:57.992 --> 42:58.833
[SPEAKER_05]: Who the fuck would spend that money?

42:58.853 --> 42:59.073
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

43:03.883 --> 43:05.043
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's lame.

43:05.283 --> 43:05.864
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, wait a minute.

43:06.104 --> 43:07.224
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever happened to our donation?

43:07.264 --> 43:08.084
[SPEAKER_07]: We never spent it, huh?

43:08.324 --> 43:08.905
I'm just kidding.

43:08.925 --> 43:09.885
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rob?

43:10.105 --> 43:11.906
[SPEAKER_02]: I am policing that, okay?

43:12.846 --> 43:14.827
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to use it to send me to ASIN.

43:15.267 --> 43:16.847
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, then I'm policing that now.

43:17.568 --> 43:22.649
[SPEAKER_12]: No, she'll be all like, back me donation, please.

43:23.089 --> 43:25.090
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you please tell the back me wool story to our listeners?

43:25.110 --> 43:25.170
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

43:25.686 --> 43:26.527
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

43:43.949 --> 43:45.530
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if Brad gave it back or not.

43:45.570 --> 43:47.950
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was funny because it's a Chinese farmer.

43:48.251 --> 43:49.511
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the inside joke.

43:51.131 --> 44:00.315
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to understand, now Irene is a hunter character and her pet is, or no, the name of her character is Back Me Wool and the name of the pet is Please.

44:01.655 --> 44:02.875
[SPEAKER_12]: And nobody gets that.

44:02.995 --> 44:03.376
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

44:03.776 --> 44:06.897
[SPEAKER_07]: And now our listeners will if they ever play on Ravencrest.

44:07.017 --> 44:07.937
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

44:07.997 --> 44:08.777
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't play on Ravencrest.

44:10.698 --> 44:11.198
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, har.

44:12.879 --> 44:13.259
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

44:14.520 --> 44:15.721
[SPEAKER_12]: Trainwreck, Choo Choo

44:37.833 --> 44:43.457
[SPEAKER_07]: You probably have read about this on your favorite blog, but I know some folks here in studio have got to share their stuff on this.

44:43.837 --> 44:47.239
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's legislation out there, of course, looking to get stricter penalties on games.

44:47.259 --> 44:50.401
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, GameStop released an internal memo this week.

44:50.421 --> 44:54.204
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it was a conference call, and managers were told about a new rule.

44:54.264 --> 44:55.385
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new strict policy.

44:55.445 --> 44:55.885
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it.

44:56.525 --> 45:03.370
[SPEAKER_07]: If you sell a game, an M-rated game, to an underage customer, you get fired immediately.

45:03.812 --> 45:11.358
[SPEAKER_07]: and if you're the manager of that store, whether you were there or not, you get fired as well for managing such a shitty employee.

45:11.438 --> 45:12.859
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad that Dan quit.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.481
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of this policy?

45:15.501 --> 45:17.683
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's retarded and I'm glad that Dan quit.

45:19.164 --> 45:27.390
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the manager, I agree that the manager should have better trained the employee, but really it's the employee that should suffer for it.

45:27.450 --> 45:29.572
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the manager should be written up.

45:30.552 --> 45:31.413
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's acceptable.

45:32.932 --> 45:33.552
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you going to do?

45:33.632 --> 45:34.853
[SPEAKER_05]: Make me work overtime?

45:34.973 --> 45:39.514
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to sell an M-rated game to a six-year-old and then you're going to get your ass fired.

45:39.534 --> 45:41.055
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a shit about this job.

45:41.535 --> 45:42.415
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go get another one.

45:45.816 --> 45:49.157
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's retarded because there's no actual law that says you have to do that.

45:49.237 --> 45:50.178
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, hey, whatever.

45:50.198 --> 45:51.758
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their store policy, I guess, you know.

45:52.459 --> 45:53.779
[SPEAKER_05]: Just make sure you follow it.

45:54.599 --> 45:55.179
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah.

45:56.500 --> 45:56.660
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

45:57.065 --> 46:08.274
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember there was a news thing also where people were doing a sting to see who they can get to sell a six-year-old or whatever.

46:09.575 --> 46:17.642
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like that Dateline NBC where they trap people on the internet and get them to come over wearing no pants to meet the 12-year-old girl?

46:17.982 --> 46:21.685
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the reporter guy jumps out and says, surprise, I'm from NBC.

46:21.725 --> 46:23.006
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy's like, I'm so embarrassed.

46:25.405 --> 46:26.325
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadow Next Gen in chat.

46:53.413 --> 46:55.375
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chat Room, for keeping us on track here.

46:55.415 --> 47:02.120
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.OrangeLondrainer.com ShadowNextGen says, The policy where managers get fired because of what their employees did is fucked up.

47:04.381 --> 47:06.403
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're responsible for training the employees properly.

47:07.123 --> 47:12.527
[SPEAKER_07]: And so writing up is not... Yeah, but what if I'm so mad at my manager and I'm going to quit anyway?

47:12.627 --> 47:15.690
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm going to sell a game to fuck my manager over too.

47:15.730 --> 47:16.570
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of screwed up.

47:16.971 --> 47:19.433
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope there's a way to dispute the firing or something.

47:20.453 --> 47:21.234
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest...

47:21.849 --> 47:29.350
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way they're going to get in trouble is if the fucking parent, you know, says, Hey, I didn't know this game had that kind of content in it.

47:29.390 --> 47:31.611
[SPEAKER_05]: If you maybe, you know, if you tell the parent or whatever.

47:32.711 --> 47:40.012
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what if, you know, for example, Billy has, you know, his friend's older brother buy the game for him or something like that.

47:40.292 --> 47:45.313
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, gets into Billy's hands and his parents go, Where the fuck did you get this from?

47:45.573 --> 47:47.974
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, the GameStop people sold it to me.

47:48.354 --> 47:50.714
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, now people are getting fired because of that.

47:51.877 --> 47:54.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Legend of Zaku makes a very interesting comparison here.

47:54.898 --> 48:03.661
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, it's only fair, Jamie, just like in Abu Ghraib, where the people who carried out the torture got the hammer, while the folks who ordered it got off scot-free.

48:04.401 --> 48:06.402
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the Iraq torture thing?

48:06.422 --> 48:11.984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the GameStop owners aren't telling them to sell the games.

48:13.304 --> 48:15.025
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really... I'm sorry, that's really...

48:15.951 --> 48:17.412
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the strangest comparison.

48:17.452 --> 48:19.734
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, no offense to Zaku, because everyone's going to tell their opinion.

48:19.754 --> 48:20.495
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to Zaku.

48:20.515 --> 48:21.235
[SPEAKER_02]: That was stupid.

48:22.316 --> 48:22.596
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

48:22.616 --> 48:23.257
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

48:23.397 --> 48:26.859
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that even... Oh, yeah.

48:26.899 --> 48:28.260
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to sell this game.

48:28.340 --> 48:29.381
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and you're fired.

48:30.522 --> 48:33.144
[SPEAKER_02]: What manager's going to do... That's fucking stupid.

48:34.745 --> 48:37.567
[SPEAKER_02]: God, think before you try to make a witty comparison.

48:37.667 --> 48:38.208
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

48:38.348 --> 48:40.089
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but that doesn't work.

48:41.510 --> 48:41.731
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

48:41.771 --> 48:43.632
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you should be selling more of those stupid...

48:44.229 --> 48:45.249
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49:15.214 --> 49:16.895
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, um... Cheers.

49:18.355 --> 49:19.256
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say jizz?

49:19.396 --> 49:20.236
[SPEAKER_02]: No, cheers!

49:20.957 --> 49:22.257
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant like you said jizz.

49:22.957 --> 49:23.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Jizz.

49:25.278 --> 49:27.959
[SPEAKER_12]: And wait, PC gaming like politically correct gaming?

49:28.020 --> 49:30.140
[SPEAKER_07]: No, like a personal computer.

49:30.341 --> 49:37.924
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, there's a martial arts MMO called Nine Dragons, and the beta is...

49:39.122 --> 49:41.403
[SPEAKER_02]: Open in, uh, actually opening in Europe.

49:41.543 --> 49:50.906
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that, um, you'll actually be able to play and get double experience until, uh, let's see, actually I'm not finding the date on here is the sad thing.

49:51.166 --> 49:52.946
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be actually open right now.

49:53.867 --> 49:56.248
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in fact, you can actually apply for the, okay, here it is.

49:56.268 --> 50:03.390
[SPEAKER_02]: You can apply for the beta over on the website, which is 9dragons.acclaim.com slash welcome.htm.

50:04.978 --> 50:08.322
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can keep on going to the site and check out the demo there.

50:08.342 --> 50:13.607
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're doing a double experience push that actually may be over already.

50:14.928 --> 50:16.309
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time I saw this, it was already over.

50:17.310 --> 50:18.211
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, you can try the game.

50:20.854 --> 50:23.417
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I got three more friend requests on Facebook.

50:23.677 --> 50:24.417
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so popular.

50:24.438 --> 50:25.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, stop gloating.

50:27.340 --> 50:27.861
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm popular.

50:28.337 --> 50:28.857
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

50:28.877 --> 50:29.818
[SPEAKER_07]: The internet is awesome.

50:29.978 --> 50:31.499
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody can be a winner.

50:31.599 --> 50:40.143
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned in Part A, Galactic Civilizations 2 is getting a brand new expansion pack called Dark Avatar.

50:41.083 --> 50:43.404
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually being released early.

50:44.845 --> 50:50.127
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, you can definitely check it out now if you're into that.

50:50.428 --> 50:57.511
[SPEAKER_05]: And it introduces brand new asteroid belts full of resources and unique planets and

50:58.635 --> 50:59.435
[SPEAKER_05]: other fun stuff like that.

50:59.495 --> 51:01.656
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play civilization, so.

51:02.176 --> 51:02.696
[SPEAKER_05]: But it sounds fun.

51:08.657 --> 51:09.517
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I wasn't listening.

51:10.017 --> 51:12.517
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie got a text message and was sharing it with everybody.

51:12.537 --> 51:14.258
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it more friends requests?

51:14.798 --> 51:16.358
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was not a Facebook friend request.

51:16.378 --> 51:17.238
[SPEAKER_07]: I already took care of those.

51:18.118 --> 51:19.639
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, Dark Avatar, one week early.

51:19.679 --> 51:20.039
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

51:23.879 --> 51:24.279
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

51:24.699 --> 51:25.220
[SPEAKER_07]: A heart.

51:26.100 --> 51:27.100
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have a hug, Loki?

51:27.560 --> 51:28.020
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have a hug?

51:28.905 --> 51:29.685
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have a hug, Jamie?

51:30.085 --> 51:30.766
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy me dinner.

51:32.086 --> 51:32.426
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

51:33.246 --> 51:33.986
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll buy you coffee.

51:35.667 --> 51:38.148
[SPEAKER_07]: Decaf, because I know you don't drink caffeine this late.

51:40.108 --> 51:40.909
[SPEAKER_02]: And potato pancakes.

51:41.509 --> 51:42.189
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll think about it.

51:42.289 --> 51:43.829
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I get a hug right now, live on air?

51:44.129 --> 51:44.730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

51:46.130 --> 51:46.450
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

51:46.490 --> 51:48.991
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I know this isn't TV, but here, I'll put the mic.

51:49.031 --> 51:52.832
[SPEAKER_07]: When I hug Jamie, I'll put the mic kind of at my chest level, so maybe you can hear her boob.

51:53.528 --> 51:55.248
[SPEAKER_02]: The best PC gaming story of 2007 right here.

52:23.308 --> 52:24.470
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:39.164 --> 52:42.525
[SPEAKER_07]: But like when the piece of one... I know you remember, Irene, because you're as big of a nerd as me.

52:42.585 --> 52:48.068
[SPEAKER_07]: For the folks who may not know, Archon was like chess, but like the pieces would actually do battle with each other when you tried to capture another piece.

52:48.088 --> 52:48.748
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Battle Chess!

52:48.988 --> 52:53.410
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not Battle Chess, because Battle Chess, the animations were already pre-done.

52:53.690 --> 52:55.891
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually had like a real-time fighting thing.

52:55.911 --> 52:57.132
[SPEAKER_07]: This game was also on the NES.

52:57.192 --> 52:58.672
[SPEAKER_07]: They ported it to several platforms.

52:59.213 --> 52:59.973
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Battle Chess.

53:00.873 --> 53:01.554
[SPEAKER_07]: Archon is better.

53:01.654 --> 53:02.994
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was even Archon 2 and 3.

53:03.214 --> 53:05.875
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't talk about Archon 2 and 3, because Archon was like the best.

53:06.436 --> 53:06.936
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

53:07.270 --> 53:08.532
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:28.476 --> 53:31.018
[SPEAKER_07]: That has huge nostalgic value for the right reasons.

53:31.259 --> 53:35.483
[SPEAKER_07]: The gameplay, the great combination of strategic thinking, and the intense arcade action.

53:35.723 --> 53:36.424
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, seriously?

53:36.964 --> 53:42.009
[SPEAKER_07]: If this game comes to Xbox Live Arcade, I will have died from too much orgasm.

53:43.431 --> 53:43.951
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now?

53:44.792 --> 53:45.412
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, seriously.

53:45.513 --> 53:47.675
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like... Look at my pants.

53:48.075 --> 53:48.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at my pants.

53:48.676 --> 53:49.176
[SPEAKER_07]: They got bigger.

53:49.256 --> 53:49.737
[SPEAKER_07]: No, please don't.

53:51.418 --> 53:51.919
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so...

53:52.591 --> 54:01.358
[SPEAKER_07]: Incredibly happy, you don't even know, like how many games of Archon I played, Light vs. Dark, in the, in the, probably in the year 83, or later.

54:01.418 --> 54:02.159
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it, Eddie!

54:04.361 --> 54:09.205
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, did you see, this is also kind of PC related, did you see the thing that they were talking about in Spore?

54:09.625 --> 54:20.014
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they were showing off some stuff at DICE also, and one of the demonstrations that they showed were, um, it was, I believe the Care Bears vs. the Klingons?

54:20.294 --> 54:20.895
Ha ha ha!

54:21.956 --> 54:24.337
[SPEAKER_05]: It created the two races and had them battle it out.

54:26.038 --> 54:27.519
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kaplaster!

54:30.461 --> 54:32.101
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait until that game comes out.

54:32.722 --> 54:35.283
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to just become a hermit once that game comes out.

54:37.264 --> 54:38.065
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have your game.

54:38.085 --> 54:38.985
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have Archon.

54:39.065 --> 54:39.385
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie?

54:40.006 --> 54:41.386
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie will have Cookie Mama on the Wii.

54:41.426 --> 54:42.027
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all happy.

54:42.107 --> 54:44.108
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know what they should resurrect from all PC days?

54:44.728 --> 54:46.549
[SPEAKER_01]: On the DS, they could do Return to Zork.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.066
[SPEAKER_01]: Zork is awesome!

54:49.146 --> 54:51.547
[SPEAKER_01]: Only the nerdiest of the nerds, because that would work perfectly on DS.

54:51.607 --> 54:54.749
[SPEAKER_02]: We found a 404 page that was the first Zork.

54:55.509 --> 54:56.790
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, the text game?

54:56.890 --> 54:57.110
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

54:57.971 --> 54:59.471
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, by the way... Oh, good point.

54:59.491 --> 55:01.713
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob D in chat says, Jamie will have Rondo of Blood.

55:02.093 --> 55:04.174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will have Rondo of Blood.

55:04.274 --> 55:06.675
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to talk about Rondo of Blood every five seconds, by the way.

55:06.875 --> 55:08.977
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookie Mama did get pushed up into March.

55:09.297 --> 55:11.998
[SPEAKER_05]: It originally was in April, so it's coming out sooner.

55:12.458 --> 55:13.899
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be out before my birthday.

55:14.099 --> 55:17.121
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know that Eddie actually told me about a fantasy he had once?

55:17.868 --> 55:20.850
[SPEAKER_07]: Eddie's fantasy was that he actually gets eaten by a grue.

55:23.112 --> 55:25.893
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you get that joke, you're awesome.

55:26.654 --> 55:27.915
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn out the lights, Rob.

55:29.676 --> 55:30.736
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me five, you're a winner.

55:30.957 --> 55:32.398
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, because the lights have to be off.

55:32.478 --> 55:34.079
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all getting eaten by grues.

55:35.219 --> 55:36.020
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a grue.

55:37.741 --> 55:42.584
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you stab the innkeeper, and then the sheriff will come.

55:44.765 --> 55:45.466
[SPEAKER_02]: I found you a grue.

55:47.259 --> 55:48.241
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Morpheus.

55:51.809 --> 55:52.951
[SPEAKER_07]: This show makes me happy.

55:55.276 --> 55:55.696
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this.

55:56.097 --> 55:56.879
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pitch black.

55:56.999 --> 55:58.262
[SPEAKER_02]: You are likely to be eaten by a Gru.

55:59.757 --> 56:00.317
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

56:00.558 --> 56:04.919
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I looked on the internet, it's only 95 megabytes, so they could totally have that on the DS.

56:04.999 --> 56:08.160
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to look that up on Wikipedia, by the way, that's G-R-U-E.

56:08.620 --> 56:09.300
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your homework, kids.

56:09.320 --> 56:10.120
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a Gru?

56:10.460 --> 56:13.922
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gru is a sinister-looking presence in the dark places of the Earth.

56:14.422 --> 56:18.763
[SPEAKER_02]: Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light.

56:19.223 --> 56:23.424
[SPEAKER_02]: No Gru has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.

56:23.444 --> 56:25.265
[SPEAKER_02]: Gru.

56:25.325 --> 56:25.545
[SPEAKER_07]: Gru.

56:25.948 --> 56:31.993
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I read somewhere in an M. Night Shyamalan film that Groos hang out with scrunts, actually.

56:32.433 --> 56:33.294
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a scrunt.

56:35.515 --> 56:36.236
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob's a scrunny bitch.

56:36.256 --> 56:38.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's the scruntiest person in the room.

56:38.457 --> 56:39.498
[SPEAKER_02]: You dirty scrunt.

56:41.540 --> 56:44.082
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to console news, DarkSakura.

56:44.602 --> 56:45.483
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

56:45.503 --> 56:47.584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm busy looking at pictures of Captain America.

56:48.485 --> 56:49.506
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Rondo of Blood.

56:51.567 --> 56:52.608
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll steal your story.

56:52.648 --> 56:53.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Sega Sammy.

56:54.029 --> 56:54.149
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

56:54.720 --> 56:56.702
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Sega, Sega, Sega.

56:57.963 --> 56:58.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

56:58.603 --> 56:58.783
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

56:58.803 --> 56:59.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

56:59.944 --> 57:00.225
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

57:00.845 --> 57:01.305
[SPEAKER_03]: That.

57:01.746 --> 57:02.306
[SPEAKER_03]: That what?

57:02.526 --> 57:02.987
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see.

57:03.267 --> 57:04.768
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an upcoming story.

57:04.888 --> 57:05.289
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

57:05.509 --> 57:08.451
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega, how the mighty have fallen.

57:08.591 --> 57:08.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega!

57:09.432 --> 57:09.772
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

57:10.413 --> 57:11.313
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturn.

57:12.674 --> 57:14.376
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega-ta-san-shiro.

57:14.596 --> 57:15.036
[SPEAKER_02]: No, anyway.

57:15.757 --> 57:16.077
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

57:16.097 --> 57:16.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill me!

57:17.878 --> 57:21.361
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, after the show though, we need you to set up the thing.

57:21.962 --> 57:22.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

57:22.947 --> 57:31.391
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega Sammy profits have slid 23% and I blame them for abandoning the Dreamcast.

57:33.192 --> 57:37.494
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, their net income went down from $526 million to $409 million.

57:37.514 --> 57:38.795
[SPEAKER_02]: Sales dropped by 4% to $3.35 billion.

57:46.610 --> 57:55.151
[SPEAKER_05]: You could say that their sales flew off course like a poorly controlled Sonic from Sonic the Hedgehog on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

57:55.472 --> 57:55.912
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

57:56.472 --> 58:01.073
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, their Pachinko machines are actually becoming a lot less popular than they were, too.

58:02.073 --> 58:04.473
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pachinko is really, really a big thing.

58:04.733 --> 58:15.115
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 has been spamming the chatroom, and usually I don't encourage this, but spamming the chatroom with this site, SegaSucks.net, and I'm looking at it, and it looks like somebody's Geocities webpage.

58:16.141 --> 58:17.882
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's my Geocities webpage!

58:18.422 --> 58:22.383
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, way to use... Let me look at the FAQ.

58:22.403 --> 58:25.784
[SPEAKER_05]: Way to use the, like, center, um... Or the about page.

58:26.644 --> 58:27.524
[SPEAKER_05]: The center paragraph.

58:27.544 --> 58:39.008
[SPEAKER_07]: See, about this site, the first, last, and only thing Sega fans ever have to say when I try to tell them my site is about stopping companies from ripping gamers off is, ha ha, yessiree, don't you know all companies are just out to make money?

58:39.488 --> 58:41.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob, Bob, Bob, I'm like... Who uses the word yessiree?

58:41.428 --> 58:41.808
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

58:42.029 --> 58:42.949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yessiree, Bob!

58:42.969 --> 58:43.649
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna say, yeah.

58:44.485 --> 58:48.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a new... Loki, you have a new story to talk to us about?

58:48.468 --> 58:50.009
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, let's talk about Crackdown.

58:50.089 --> 58:50.769
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sirree.

58:51.570 --> 58:54.772
[SPEAKER_05]: Crackdown, one of the most awesome games this week.

58:55.292 --> 58:56.713
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the demo is.

58:57.854 --> 59:12.183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only going to be... They're only going to have male avatars to play as right now, because apparently they haven't finished the female ones, and I guess the females would have a whole new set of animations for bulking up as you progress through the game, so...

59:12.762 --> 59:15.383
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget periods So yeah, if you're looking to play a female character

59:42.280 --> 59:43.081
[SPEAKER_05]: That won't be happening.

59:43.121 --> 59:43.961
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what, though?

59:43.981 --> 59:51.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Crackdown was one of those games that they said that if later on they wanted to add a new island, a new set of gangs or whatever, they could do that.

59:51.524 --> 59:53.845
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't see why they wouldn't build a woman gang.

59:53.986 --> 59:55.486
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, female avatars later.

59:55.606 --> 59:58.227
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's probably going to be in Download Pack.

59:58.268 --> 01:00:02.670
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here to complain you to death!

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:09.473
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, you have your agility, firearms, explosives, and driving.

01:00:09.813 --> 01:00:10.053
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

01:00:10.863 --> 01:00:12.604
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't level up driving skills.

01:00:12.624 --> 01:00:13.404
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

01:00:13.964 --> 01:00:16.945
[SPEAKER_05]: And so complaining, I guess, would have to be in there.

01:00:18.145 --> 01:00:21.686
[SPEAKER_07]: Bershaz in chat makes the very mature comment, boobie go boom.

01:00:25.307 --> 01:00:30.068
[SPEAKER_07]: TheRobD says, well, they thought the driving was enough simulation of being a woman anyway.

01:00:31.669 --> 01:00:32.589
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, comment.

01:00:33.009 --> 01:00:34.650
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking forward to playing a woman in Crackdown?

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:39.811
[SPEAKER_02]: You are putting me looking forward and Crackdown in the same sentence.

01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:42.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie can't give two shits about Crackdown.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:43.050
[SPEAKER_02]: She just can't.

01:00:44.751 --> 01:00:45.652
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, really.

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:48.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even with, you know, X-Lax.

01:00:49.093 --> 01:00:51.835
[SPEAKER_05]: She's constipated when it comes to Crackdown.

01:00:53.136 --> 01:00:55.016
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I would need a colonic.

01:00:55.317 --> 01:00:55.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:00:57.618 --> 01:01:02.140
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if I lose a little more weight, every time I bend over, you're going to see a Crackdown, actually.

01:01:05.282 --> 01:01:05.662
Gross.

01:01:07.242 --> 01:01:12.604
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of things coming out your ass, EGM posted seven rumors in their magazine.

01:01:13.665 --> 01:01:17.406
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how founded these rumors are or not, but I'm going to share them with you now.

01:01:17.446 --> 01:01:19.407
[SPEAKER_07]: These are from issue number 213.

01:01:20.007 --> 01:01:23.069
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor number one we already talked about a little bit earlier in the program.

01:01:23.389 --> 01:01:28.651
[SPEAKER_07]: Square has another MMO in the works for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:01:29.051 --> 01:01:32.312
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't be in Vanadil, but a world from previous FF games.

01:01:32.452 --> 01:01:34.013
[SPEAKER_12]: So that could be in tandem with... Is it Avalos?

01:01:34.747 --> 01:01:36.067
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, it could be in a Valis game.

01:01:36.107 --> 01:01:36.988
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, that'd be awesome.

01:01:37.588 --> 01:01:40.188
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, what if it was like Final Fantasy VI MMO?

01:01:40.248 --> 01:01:41.649
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure a lot of folks have a boner over that.

01:01:41.669 --> 01:01:42.569
[SPEAKER_12]: I would hella play that.

01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:44.970
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor two is that Tekken 6 got pushed back until 2008.

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:46.970
[SPEAKER_12]: Cute, cute, anyway.

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.550
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Jamie.

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:49.031
[SPEAKER_07]: Tekken 6, 2008.

01:01:49.411 --> 01:01:50.111
[SPEAKER_12]: Bastards!

01:01:50.711 --> 01:01:51.711
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a rumor, though.

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:52.712
[SPEAKER_07]: EGM could be full of it.

01:01:52.872 --> 01:01:53.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards!

01:01:53.712 --> 01:01:54.532
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's probably true.

01:01:55.672 --> 01:02:00.333
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor three, Mistwalker is planning a Blue Dragon 2, but only if it does well in the US.

01:02:00.794 --> 01:02:02.374
[SPEAKER_07]: A DS spinoff is also possible.

01:02:03.965 --> 01:02:09.208
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor number four is Wipeout will hit the PlayStation 3 in 2007 and it uses the MotorStorm engine.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:10.569
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be interesting.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:17.294
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor number five is, oh, my hero, Mizuguchi, is working on a Space Channel 5 follow-up.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:19.455
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Channel 6.

01:02:20.156 --> 01:02:20.616
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:22.317
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it's called, but that would be awesome.

01:02:22.557 --> 01:02:26.740
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be Space Channel 5 2, like MTV 2.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:30.102
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor number six is there's an Indiana Jones game to hit with a movie in 2008.

01:02:30.142 --> 01:02:30.262
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh!

01:02:30.282 --> 01:02:30.342
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh!

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:34.111
[SPEAKER_07]: Every freaking big movie gets a game time.

01:02:34.131 --> 01:02:36.772
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already seen that at E3.

01:02:37.073 --> 01:02:37.453
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh.

01:02:37.513 --> 01:02:38.193
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a rumor.

01:02:38.834 --> 01:02:42.275
[SPEAKER_07]: And then lastly, EA is making a Kitty Madden.

01:02:43.156 --> 01:02:43.676
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.

01:02:43.696 --> 01:02:49.819
[SPEAKER_05]: They already have an Atari, like the backyard football and stuff that sucks balls, so they could easily do that.

01:02:49.859 --> 01:02:50.960
[SPEAKER_05]: What is a Kitty Madden?

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:51.841
[SPEAKER_12]: Kitty Madden?

01:02:51.941 --> 01:02:52.061
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

01:02:52.821 --> 01:02:58.584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they're bringing the puppy bowl and the kitty halftime to the consoles we talked about last week.

01:02:58.864 --> 01:03:00.025
[SPEAKER_07]: EA has heard our prayers.

01:03:00.045 --> 01:03:00.265
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

01:03:02.688 --> 01:03:03.769
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what it would sound like?

01:03:04.089 --> 01:03:05.190
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of, yeah.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.930
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we hear that again?

01:03:06.311 --> 01:03:07.171
[SPEAKER_12]: Meow, meow, meow.

01:03:07.191 --> 01:03:08.112
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, that was great.

01:03:08.172 --> 01:03:10.754
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

01:03:10.794 --> 01:03:11.194
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

01:03:12.896 --> 01:03:13.456
[SPEAKER_12]: Playing football.

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:16.739
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew Nami says Space Channel 5 2 was already leased, wasn't it?

01:03:16.879 --> 01:03:19.521
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's true, but more Space Channel 5 could not be a bad thing.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:24.584
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Space Channel 5 2, and that gave me fit, because of the whole backwards level.

01:03:24.724 --> 01:03:25.325
[SPEAKER_07]: I want pudding.

01:03:25.925 --> 01:03:28.167
[SPEAKER_07]: I want more, not like actual pudding, but the character.

01:03:28.207 --> 01:03:29.268
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, way to be random.

01:03:30.663 --> 01:03:32.685
[SPEAKER_07]: Bershaw's one said EA's Lingerie Bowl 2008.

01:03:32.885 --> 01:03:36.409
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be one for the kids.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:42.255
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to be taking... Irene does have a point.

01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:45.238
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see kittens in, like, little football jerseys.

01:03:45.718 --> 01:03:49.602
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but that would be... As cute as it is, I would probably buy that.

01:03:52.064 --> 01:03:54.287
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, we'll see if EA answers your question.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:57.241
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be getting your Skype calls very, very soon.

01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:58.221
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a couple more stories.

01:03:58.461 --> 01:04:00.682
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's a bunch of no shit, Sherlock.

01:04:01.982 --> 01:04:08.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Wii has outsold the PS3 by a mere 3 to 1 ratio in January in Japan.

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:09.885
[SPEAKER_06]: Take that, bitches!

01:04:11.323 --> 01:04:13.224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like I said, a bunch of no shit there.

01:04:13.244 --> 01:04:28.272
[SPEAKER_05]: I do remember, actually one of my coworkers was asking me, he read an article that some PlayStation rep or someone at Sony was claiming that the PS3 was outselling the Wii and the DS combined in Japan.

01:04:28.452 --> 01:04:36.657
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't make our show roll tonight because there was a lot of news, but there was a pretty well-circulated story out there that somebody from Sony Computer Europe said something like,

01:04:37.117 --> 01:04:43.364
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can find a PlayStation 3 out there on store shelves, I'll give you $1,200 or something like that.

01:04:43.524 --> 01:04:47.528
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they promptly proceeded to show four of them at the same place.

01:04:47.768 --> 01:04:48.689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:50.791
[SPEAKER_07]: As I saw a bunch of them at GameStop today.

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:54.375
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, I could have made $12,000, but I don't think he was serious.

01:04:55.096 --> 01:04:59.080
[SPEAKER_02]: See, if they're selling at a 3-to-1 ratio, so basically...

01:05:00.169 --> 01:05:01.792
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making $900 for every $600 that Sony makes.

01:05:01.832 --> 01:05:02.833
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already beating them by $300 per system.

01:05:14.473 --> 01:05:20.415
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not per system, but per group sale if you're comparing Nintendo's 3 to Sony's 1.

01:05:20.615 --> 01:05:25.296
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not even counting if they're doing the high-end system or the low-end system.

01:05:25.776 --> 01:05:29.517
[SPEAKER_02]: So even profit-wise, Nintendo's got the head above it.

01:05:29.537 --> 01:05:36.499
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some people, I've actually argued this with some people, they're saying, oh, since Sony's selling for more, they're going to make more money.

01:05:37.899 --> 01:05:43.421
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because Nintendo loves us and supply is doing its damned best to meet demand.

01:05:43.843 --> 01:05:45.343
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, this is great.

01:05:45.564 --> 01:05:51.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew Nami sent me a link to this week's Penny Arcade, which actually makes fun of this specific instance as well.

01:05:52.005 --> 01:05:59.628
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, in a recent interview, SEA President Jack Tretton claimed that he would pay a $1,200 bounty on any PS3 system that was found on store shelves.

01:06:00.028 --> 01:06:04.549
[SPEAKER_07]: And they went around town and proceeded to get two at the Best Buy across the street, one at the Target, da-da-da.

01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:06.230
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the end, they'd racked up $13,200.

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:12.011
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it says, when we get the money, we should go get a couple Wii's.

01:06:12.592 --> 01:06:13.612
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if we can find one.

01:06:15.287 --> 01:06:20.631
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is, you know what, if you're a Sony fanboy, I'm sorry that we keep picking on you, but it's true.

01:06:20.691 --> 01:06:22.132
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Wii's are still hard to come by.

01:06:22.432 --> 01:06:27.056
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind what I said earlier in Part A about the guy who came, dude, I got a Wii today, I actually found one.

01:06:27.076 --> 01:06:28.737
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Target got a shipment this morning.

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:33.580
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true, like, Wii's are still kind of hard to come by, and PlayStation 3s are out there.

01:06:33.861 --> 01:06:41.146
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my local Blockbuster, like, all the employees there are, like, vying for the Nintendo, and, like, I go in and they'll be like, oh my god, I got mine, because they, like, cannot find them.

01:06:42.142 --> 01:06:42.782
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.

01:06:42.802 --> 01:06:43.242
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what?

01:06:43.423 --> 01:06:47.984
[SPEAKER_12]: Once Tactics comes out on PSP, the PSP is going to outsell the PS3 again.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:48.385
[SPEAKER_07]: You think?

01:06:48.565 --> 01:06:49.925
[SPEAKER_07]: The PSP is going to outsell the PS3?

01:06:50.145 --> 01:06:51.506
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, when Tactics comes out.

01:06:51.766 --> 01:06:54.107
[SPEAKER_07]: You are not a PSP fangirl in the least.

01:06:54.127 --> 01:06:55.588
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely am not.

01:06:55.668 --> 01:06:56.488
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I could care less.

01:06:56.688 --> 01:07:03.771
[SPEAKER_12]: But with this news about Tactics coming on to PSP with the frickin' Dark Knights, I'm so happy.

01:07:04.191 --> 01:07:05.031
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you just cum?

01:07:05.392 --> 01:07:06.172
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?

01:07:06.252 --> 01:07:06.912
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit.

01:07:07.653 --> 01:07:11.094
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, and then Castlevania, and then Luminous 2, and...

01:07:11.772 --> 01:07:13.373
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think I'm going to have to invest in one.

01:07:13.873 --> 01:07:14.113
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:07:14.473 --> 01:07:17.194
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you, Jamie, for the Japanese sales report.

01:07:17.595 --> 01:07:20.396
[SPEAKER_07]: Or should I say, arigato.

01:07:21.316 --> 01:07:28.700
[SPEAKER_02]: I did find something completely unrelated, though, and that's someone made Captain America in SmackDown vs. Raw.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:29.420
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.420
[SPEAKER_07]: That's completely unrelated.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.121
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I think it's pretty funny.

01:07:32.962 --> 01:07:33.482
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

01:07:34.202 --> 01:07:37.143
[SPEAKER_07]: One more story, and then we're going to go to our Skype line at 877-GAME-OLR.

01:07:38.933 --> 01:07:39.653
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:08:04.011 --> 01:08:09.193
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, no details really on the game at all, except that they were supposed to be starting from scratch again.

01:08:09.293 --> 01:08:11.454
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever that means.

01:08:14.635 --> 01:08:17.456
[SPEAKER_07]: Mortal Kombat on the Unreal Engine?

01:08:17.496 --> 01:08:20.217
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is it going to be like a 3D fighter?

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:25.098
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they say it's not going to be like a fighting type game like we know today.

01:08:26.239 --> 01:08:30.420
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't help but think of some of those really crappy Mythologies games at Sub-Zero.

01:08:30.839 --> 01:08:30.939
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

01:08:51.087 --> 01:08:55.329
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess we'll open up the Skype line and see what our listeners have to say about that.

01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:56.330
[SPEAKER_07]: You can give us a call.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:59.311
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.

01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:01.732
[SPEAKER_07]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:02.113 --> 01:09:04.854
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you can give us a call with the old-fashioned telephone.

01:09:05.394 --> 01:09:07.676
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:09:08.496 --> 01:09:14.159
[SPEAKER_07]: That's toll-free in the United States and Canada, but not toll-free, sad face, abroad.

01:09:14.179 --> 01:09:18.681
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have to use the Skype line if you're in the UK or Australia, in which case it's probably past your bedtime.

01:09:18.961 --> 01:09:19.301
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait.

01:09:19.362 --> 01:09:20.042
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say, what?

01:09:20.714 --> 01:09:23.697
[SPEAKER_12]: They have to use the old-fashioned telephone, like a rotary phone?

01:09:24.017 --> 01:09:25.598
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can use touch-tone.

01:09:25.638 --> 01:09:26.379
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be acceptable.

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:28.000
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a party line where you call the operator.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.082
[SPEAKER_12]: Like two cans and a stream?

01:09:30.142 --> 01:09:31.243
[SPEAKER_07]: A cellular telephone.

01:09:31.624 --> 01:09:33.946
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we're having the Dixie Cups installed this week.

01:09:34.026 --> 01:09:34.886
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fascinating.

01:09:35.307 --> 01:09:38.870
[SPEAKER_07]: And people will be able to use the two tin cans and a piece of yarn to talk to us soon.

01:09:40.451 --> 01:09:41.833
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on Orange Lodge Radio.

01:09:41.873 --> 01:09:42.593
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this caller?

01:09:43.294 --> 01:09:43.894
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of Zaku.

01:09:44.295 --> 01:09:45.676
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

01:09:45.696 --> 01:09:46.417
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

01:09:47.638 --> 01:09:47.718
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh...

01:09:48.655 --> 01:09:50.116
[SPEAKER_07]: Just random stuff.

01:09:50.476 --> 01:09:52.316
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I know you're full of random stuff tonight.

01:09:52.336 --> 01:09:53.777
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not taking it back, by the way.

01:09:54.537 --> 01:09:55.317
[SPEAKER_07]: Zach, what's on your mind?

01:09:55.978 --> 01:10:05.661
[SPEAKER_11]: I meant, basically what I meant when I said that was that, you know, just like a manager is like a captain on a ship, he's responsible for everyone that runs it.

01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:08.262
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's pretty much the analogy.

01:10:09.402 --> 01:10:11.563
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to admit, though, it was a weird-ass comparison.

01:10:11.603 --> 01:10:17.445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but is a responsible captain on a ship going to order his crew to throw their shipment overboard?

01:10:20.895 --> 01:10:29.407
[SPEAKER_02]: You were doing it as though your reference specifically stated that the manager was ordering the employees Isn't that what happened at the Boston Tea Party?

01:10:32.932 --> 01:10:33.633
[SPEAKER_07]: Touche.

01:10:33.994 --> 01:10:34.695
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

01:10:36.388 --> 01:10:38.470
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank your comparisons through before stating them.

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:39.751
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand what you mean.

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:42.432
[SPEAKER_02]: However, your comparison was completely off-base.

01:10:42.512 --> 01:10:43.753
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't we just all get along?

01:10:44.034 --> 01:10:44.334
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:45.054
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hug.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.295
[SPEAKER_12]: Not until you buy me pie.

01:10:46.755 --> 01:10:50.778
[SPEAKER_12]: If you changed the T in touche to a D, it'd be douchey.

01:10:51.919 --> 01:10:52.379
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up!

01:10:52.699 --> 01:10:54.480
[SPEAKER_07]: Saku, please, put us back on track.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.301
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you want to talk about?

01:10:55.741 --> 01:10:55.941
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

01:10:56.101 --> 01:10:56.242
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh?

01:10:56.262 --> 01:10:57.082
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

01:11:02.597 --> 01:11:04.438
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear to God I'm not fucking with this connection.

01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:07.119
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, are you fucking with this connection?

01:11:07.259 --> 01:11:08.700
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm watching someone draw Captain America.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.961
[SPEAKER_07]: Zaku, try it one more time.

01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:12.462
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, if you can't get it out clearly, we're going to have to move on.

01:11:12.662 --> 01:11:13.703
[SPEAKER_07]: Zaku, what was on your mind?

01:11:19.346 --> 01:11:20.886
[SPEAKER_07]: Send it in a text message, Zaku.

01:11:20.926 --> 01:11:22.247
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll try to get to it later.

01:11:22.847 --> 01:11:24.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, but it's just not coming through.

01:11:24.628 --> 01:11:26.109
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll hear it on the playback.

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.810
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a bummer.

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.351
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, if you want to call us, 877-GAME-OLR

01:11:32.202 --> 01:11:33.903
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear I was not screwing with that call.

01:11:35.404 --> 01:11:37.384
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor Saku.

01:11:37.425 --> 01:11:38.965
[SPEAKER_07]: Send your question over private message, Saku.

01:11:39.005 --> 01:11:39.445
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take it.

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:41.586
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go to this call.

01:11:41.606 --> 01:11:42.527
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

01:11:42.547 --> 01:11:42.867
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

01:11:44.368 --> 01:11:45.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.

01:11:45.889 --> 01:11:46.789
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Paradox Vincent.

01:11:46.809 --> 01:11:47.489
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:53.772
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I recently acquired a laptop.

01:11:55.693 --> 01:11:59.035
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a new VAIO, and it had Vista on it.

01:11:59.995 --> 01:12:01.236
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, so it's a brand new laptop.

01:12:01.296 --> 01:12:01.496
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:12:02.523 --> 01:12:06.505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, um, do not like it at all.

01:12:07.786 --> 01:12:08.106
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

01:12:08.186 --> 01:12:08.786
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong with it?

01:12:11.068 --> 01:12:22.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, there are some, uh, there are some applications on it that aren't exactly, you know, uh, well, there's smaller applications.

01:12:23.294 --> 01:12:31.939
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them, I think, is actually a foreign one called Bimania DX, and it's kind of like the Stepmania of B-Mania.

01:12:32.469 --> 01:12:32.669
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

01:12:32.909 --> 01:12:33.690
[SPEAKER_07]: That wouldn't work.

01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:42.414
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um... So, basically, you're upset because a lot of the old games and things you were using on Windows XP won't work on Windows Vista.

01:12:44.455 --> 01:12:59.723
[SPEAKER_09]: That, and also that, uh... I'm trying to remember... The main reason that I downloaded it, well, one of them was for music creation software, and my sequencer wouldn't work on it.

01:12:59.803 --> 01:13:01.404
[SPEAKER_09]: It just performs...

01:13:02.401 --> 01:13:02.661
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

01:13:02.721 --> 01:13:02.821
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:04.842
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um... Yes.

01:13:04.862 --> 01:13:05.562
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always said that, uh...

01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:27.877
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it a couple of years and I'm pretty sure that it'll be an awesome application.

01:13:27.957 --> 01:13:31.179
[SPEAKER_07]: So what caused you to jump on board the Vista train at this point?

01:13:31.219 --> 01:13:33.501
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it just because you had no other choice because you got the new laptop?

01:13:34.942 --> 01:13:37.624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they took the model out that I was going to get.

01:13:37.644 --> 01:13:40.006
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

01:13:41.387 --> 01:13:50.314
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's really too bad because it's a great skin, but I can do everything that I'm doing on Vista with an XP.

01:13:51.535 --> 01:13:57.981
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking forward to any of the gaming that's supposed to be coming out with the Vista, such as Halo 2 or any of that stuff?

01:14:00.543 --> 01:14:01.223
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of.

01:14:02.364 --> 01:14:12.713
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I have a little more powerful Windows machine, because my other two were pretty... They were really, really old.

01:14:13.473 --> 01:14:17.236
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that I have something... I got a 2.3...

01:14:20.484 --> 01:14:24.467
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:57.807
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, well, also, I'd like to kind of give my opinion on, uh, the, uh, how Konami basically releases the same game over and over again, but with new songs.

01:14:57.927 --> 01:14:59.548
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, quickly, please, because we've got to keep moving.

01:15:01.489 --> 01:15:12.316
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever I bought a new Beatmania game, at least, I don't know about DDR, but when I bought a new Beatmania game, I significantly improved.

01:15:12.637 --> 01:15:15.078
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost jumped another level up.

01:15:15.879 --> 01:15:16.199
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

01:15:17.006 --> 01:15:22.231
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that new songs are really all that I need to justify a whole new game.

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:22.311
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

01:15:22.371 --> 01:15:22.451
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

01:15:22.511 --> 01:15:22.711
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

01:15:22.731 --> 01:15:22.911
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

01:15:22.931 --> 01:15:23.071
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

01:15:43.382 --> 01:15:44.802
[SPEAKER_12]: So he has a huge EP in him?

01:15:45.043 --> 01:15:45.823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he has a huge EP.

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:52.965
[SPEAKER_07]: He was kind of, he's kind of, it sounded like either he was high or he had the show on in the background and he was listening to it because I thought I heard myself recall it.

01:15:52.985 --> 01:15:54.046
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe both.

01:15:54.146 --> 01:15:54.626
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe both.

01:15:55.486 --> 01:15:56.186
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

01:15:56.426 --> 01:15:57.387
[SPEAKER_07]: We tease because we love.

01:15:57.427 --> 01:15:58.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to some other calls.

01:16:00.068 --> 01:16:02.849
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go over here to this call.

01:16:02.949 --> 01:16:03.909
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:16:03.929 --> 01:16:04.189
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

01:16:08.092 --> 01:16:09.112
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's Seisha here.

01:16:09.372 --> 01:16:10.633
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Seisha, what's on your mind?

01:16:10.673 --> 01:16:12.794
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn down your speakers, because we can hear ourselves a little bit.

01:16:12.854 --> 01:16:13.334
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

01:16:16.515 --> 01:16:17.916
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hearing it echoing.

01:16:19.916 --> 01:16:20.897
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, it's echoing.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:21.617
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:22.837
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

01:16:22.897 --> 01:16:23.798
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a delay, too.

01:16:24.118 --> 01:16:27.399
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's because our voices are traveling all the way across the Atlantic.

01:16:27.419 --> 01:16:30.720
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I was just going to ask a question about Final Fantasy XII.

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.521
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, what do you want to know about Final Fantasy XII?

01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:42.393
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know where this story leads to because I look on the internet everywhere and I can't find anything about it and I like spoilers.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:44.414
[SPEAKER_07]: You want spoilers on the story?

01:16:48.676 --> 01:16:49.777
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm impatient.

01:16:50.717 --> 01:16:59.743
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't tell you that because that would ruin it for our listeners, but you could go to GameFAQs.com and there's a bunch of FAQs on how to get through the game or the strategy guide that's available.

01:17:00.203 --> 01:17:02.224
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's places out there where you can get it spoiled.

01:17:02.404 --> 01:17:03.765
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just not looking hard enough, buddy.

01:17:05.063 --> 01:17:07.624
[SPEAKER_07]: And besides, I haven't beaten it, so I couldn't tell you what happens.

01:17:08.644 --> 01:17:11.464
[SPEAKER_07]: There was like 50 games that came out in November that I haven't played.

01:17:11.484 --> 01:17:12.205
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't beaten it yet?

01:17:12.225 --> 01:17:12.885
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I haven't.

01:17:12.905 --> 01:17:15.145
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gotten like... I got sucked back into WoW.

01:17:17.506 --> 01:17:17.926
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, true.

01:17:17.986 --> 01:17:19.086
[SPEAKER_10]: I got back into WoW.

01:17:19.746 --> 01:17:20.806
[SPEAKER_10]: Like at level 70 already.

01:17:22.707 --> 01:17:23.227
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well.

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:28.828
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there anything else you wanted to ask us about tonight besides the spoilers for Final Fantasy XII, which we're not sharing?

01:17:30.289 --> 01:17:32.309
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you so crazy this evening?

01:17:33.044 --> 01:17:34.005
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're... I don't know.

01:17:34.045 --> 01:17:35.506
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we crazy this evening?

01:17:35.646 --> 01:17:36.246
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my fault.

01:17:36.827 --> 01:17:40.169
[SPEAKER_07]: That's partially Eddie and Rice Princess being here, but what else?

01:17:40.209 --> 01:17:41.070
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's just something in the air.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:46.753
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I'm a little bit unable to concentrate quite correctly today.

01:17:47.134 --> 01:17:49.235
[SPEAKER_12]: Banks, you sound really cute and hot.

01:17:49.836 --> 01:17:51.577
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop trying to get a date on the show.

01:17:51.777 --> 01:17:53.258
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, how am I supposed to date you?

01:17:53.358 --> 01:17:54.579
[SPEAKER_12]: You sound sexy.

01:17:54.619 --> 01:17:55.039
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:56.840
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means he's probably taken.

01:17:58.482 --> 01:17:59.182
[SPEAKER_07]: What was I going to say?

01:17:59.402 --> 01:17:59.462
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

01:18:01.676 --> 01:18:02.917
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:18:31.505 --> 01:18:34.107
[SPEAKER_07]: Sasha, we gotta let you go, but thanks so much for your phone call.

01:18:34.967 --> 01:18:35.608
[SPEAKER_07]: And cheers.

01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:39.490
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

01:18:39.991 --> 01:18:40.871
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too much delay.

01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:41.912
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't keep it going.

01:18:41.952 --> 01:18:42.292
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, kids.

01:18:42.352 --> 01:18:43.433
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to say bi-sexy.

01:18:43.493 --> 01:18:44.213
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks a lot.

01:18:45.014 --> 01:18:45.434
[SPEAKER_07]: We got it.

01:18:45.915 --> 01:18:46.435
[SPEAKER_07]: Say it now.

01:18:46.495 --> 01:18:47.195
[SPEAKER_07]: Sasha's listening.

01:18:47.235 --> 01:18:47.676
[SPEAKER_12]: Bi-sexy.

01:18:47.996 --> 01:18:48.416
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:50.397
[SPEAKER_07]: You are so weird.

01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:51.218
[SPEAKER_12]: You're weird.

01:18:51.238 --> 01:18:52.019
[SPEAKER_12]: Your face is weird.

01:18:52.039 --> 01:18:53.399
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:53.419 --> 01:18:53.860
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

01:18:56.822 --> 01:18:58.163
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:58.183 --> 01:18:58.563
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

01:19:00.592 --> 01:19:01.773
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hi, this is Uni.

01:19:02.093 --> 01:19:03.274
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, what's on your mind?

01:19:03.815 --> 01:19:05.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, sexy pants?

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:08.759
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, sweetie?

01:19:12.242 --> 01:19:14.363
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I crack me up, too.

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:24.071
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to ask you guys if World of Warcraft was really worth it, because... Wait, we can hardly hear you.

01:19:24.652 --> 01:19:26.133
[SPEAKER_07]: What about World of Warcraft?

01:19:26.153 --> 01:19:27.434
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to ask what about World of Warcraft?

01:19:32.654 --> 01:19:34.115
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really worth it?

01:19:35.115 --> 01:19:40.298
[SPEAKER_07]: She's actually being eaten by a Gru as she's talking to us, which is why she can't stop laughing.

01:19:41.099 --> 01:19:44.221
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so worth it.

01:19:44.261 --> 01:19:46.882
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the biggest addict probably out of all of us, right, Princess?

01:19:46.922 --> 01:19:47.383
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

01:19:48.601 --> 01:19:48.881
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:51.403
[SPEAKER_07]: You hated all MMOs before World of Warcraft.

01:19:51.543 --> 01:19:51.763
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

01:19:51.783 --> 01:19:52.804
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely hated them.

01:19:52.844 --> 01:19:54.806
[SPEAKER_07]: What sold you on World of Warcraft specifically?

01:19:55.026 --> 01:19:56.067
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't know.

01:19:56.767 --> 01:19:59.649
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that was an awesome answer.

01:19:59.669 --> 01:20:02.972
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Matt gave me the two-week demo-y disc thing, whatever.

01:20:02.992 --> 01:20:04.193
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all Matt, our friend.

01:20:04.373 --> 01:20:04.753
[SPEAKER_12]: Love you, Matt.

01:20:06.079 --> 01:20:07.860
[SPEAKER_12]: and I was like, whatever, I'm bored.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.101
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not working.

01:20:09.181 --> 01:20:09.841
[SPEAKER_07]: Uni hung up.

01:20:10.261 --> 01:20:11.041
[SPEAKER_07]: She was embarrassed.

01:20:11.962 --> 01:20:12.642
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be embarrassed.

01:20:12.662 --> 01:20:13.363
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

01:20:13.703 --> 01:20:15.884
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, okay, I'll give it a try.

01:20:15.964 --> 01:20:22.567
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got to level 20 in like two days or something and you can't go past level 20 if you're on the demo thing.

01:20:22.587 --> 01:20:24.168
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, oh man, that sucks.

01:20:24.208 --> 01:20:25.288
[SPEAKER_12]: This game's awesome.

01:20:25.368 --> 01:20:28.290
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I subscribed to it and then I signed my life away.

01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:29.450
[SPEAKER_12]: It was pretty awesome.

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:35.113
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Paradox Vincent, who I accused of being high earlier, sent me a message and said, no, you're a tell-all.

01:20:37.337 --> 01:20:42.842
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Tyrant wants to know, Rice Princess, what level are you?

01:20:43.483 --> 01:20:46.285
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have any 60s and I've been playing for two years.

01:20:46.565 --> 01:20:47.907
[SPEAKER_12]: But you're a twink.

01:20:48.007 --> 01:20:48.727
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because you're a twink.

01:20:48.807 --> 01:20:49.768
[SPEAKER_12]: I have many twinks.

01:20:50.409 --> 01:20:52.170
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a lot of PVP twinks.

01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:54.272
[SPEAKER_07]: War Song Gold Show for life.

01:20:56.914 --> 01:20:58.456
[SPEAKER_12]: My highest level tune is a 38 Warlock.

01:21:00.738 --> 01:21:01.338
[SPEAKER_12]: on Trollbane.

01:21:01.618 --> 01:21:09.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Uni, I bet you any of the WoW players would be glad to hook you up with a free demo of WoW because they do that thing where you can download a demo on worldofwarcraft.com.

01:21:09.562 --> 01:21:10.722
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what?

01:21:10.762 --> 01:21:12.903
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the whole Xbox 360 strategy.

01:21:13.063 --> 01:21:14.464
[SPEAKER_07]: Demos, try before you buy.

01:21:14.504 --> 01:21:15.924
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's the best way to figure it out.

01:21:16.065 --> 01:21:17.605
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, girl, and I'll play with you.

01:21:17.925 --> 01:21:18.646
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

01:21:18.746 --> 01:21:19.286
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll show you around, girl.

01:21:19.306 --> 01:21:20.146
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the girls' club.

01:21:20.346 --> 01:21:21.407
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the girls' club on Warcraft.

01:21:21.447 --> 01:21:23.148
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we get our hair did in the game.

01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:26.269
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, here it is.

01:21:26.389 --> 01:21:28.970
[SPEAKER_07]: Uni says the classic, it's just that I want a blood elf.

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:31.127
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:21:39.441 --> 01:21:41.222
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the gay twink.

01:21:41.242 --> 01:21:42.703
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the gay porn kind of twink.

01:21:42.743 --> 01:21:45.485
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't know what that is, you're fine.

01:21:45.605 --> 01:21:46.325
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, a gay, yeah.

01:21:46.705 --> 01:21:49.207
[SPEAKER_07]: What is a twink in WoW, Bryce Princess?

01:21:49.287 --> 01:21:50.007
[SPEAKER_07]: Where does the name come from?

01:21:50.027 --> 01:21:58.172
[SPEAKER_12]: A twink in WoW is someone that has the best possible gear, the best enchants, the best everything that you can have at that level.

01:21:58.712 --> 01:22:01.634
[SPEAKER_07]: And it helps if they have blonde hair and they're usually Russian.

01:22:01.654 --> 01:22:02.014
[SPEAKER_07]: Russian.

01:22:04.758 --> 01:22:05.718
[SPEAKER_12]: You're terrible, Ron.

01:22:06.078 --> 01:22:11.761
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have a lot of twinks, and it's easy for me because I'm a girl, and I say, Hi, I'll be your internet girlfriend.

01:22:11.801 --> 01:22:12.401
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me gold.

01:22:12.781 --> 01:22:14.642
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're like, Okay, that's pretty cool.

01:22:14.982 --> 01:22:16.502
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, Sweet, I have a twink now.

01:22:16.622 --> 01:22:17.203
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

01:22:18.123 --> 01:22:19.043
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice knowing you.

01:22:19.443 --> 01:22:22.044
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm not really like that all the time.

01:22:22.565 --> 01:22:25.286
[SPEAKER_12]: But, yeah, that's what a twink is.

01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:28.147
[SPEAKER_12]: That was education.

01:22:28.167 --> 01:22:29.527
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to explain what a gay twink is.

01:22:29.547 --> 01:22:30.487
[SPEAKER_01]: Look it up on Wikipedia.

01:22:30.507 --> 01:22:30.668
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:22:30.688 --> 01:22:30.788
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:22:33.103 --> 01:22:34.683
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and isn't that so cool?

01:22:35.244 --> 01:22:39.345
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you could be a guy and just have a really high-pitched voice and be like, Hi!

01:22:40.225 --> 01:22:42.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, they have a Valentine's Day event going on right now.

01:22:42.446 --> 01:22:42.966
[SPEAKER_07]: They do?

01:22:43.046 --> 01:22:47.787
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was trying to have my girl hit on other girls, but I didn't.

01:22:48.388 --> 01:22:49.468
[SPEAKER_12]: You were trying to be a lesbian?

01:22:49.588 --> 01:22:50.328
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's fun.

01:22:50.388 --> 01:22:51.008
[SPEAKER_07]: Lesbians are fun.

01:22:51.208 --> 01:22:53.769
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you're supposed to hit on guys and they'll give you money.

01:22:54.509 --> 01:22:56.770
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, I ended up hitting on guys because I screwed up.

01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:59.451
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the wrong thing, so I just decided to play it straight.

01:22:59.827 --> 01:23:02.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Beatmania and Virtual Console Games Who said you could call?

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:22.644
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I paid Loki five bucks.

01:23:22.785 --> 01:23:23.885
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it must be DMN.

01:23:24.005 --> 01:23:24.546
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, DMN.

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:25.086
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

01:23:25.586 --> 01:23:26.407
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing pretty good.

01:23:26.707 --> 01:23:30.729
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are talking about, uh... Wait, DMN, you've been a long-time listener of the show, right?

01:23:31.209 --> 01:23:31.510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:33.210
[SPEAKER_07]: Is tonight a good show or a bad show?

01:23:33.271 --> 01:23:33.751
[SPEAKER_07]: Be honest.

01:23:34.251 --> 01:23:35.712
[SPEAKER_08]: God, this show's hilarious.

01:23:35.732 --> 01:23:36.672
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?

01:23:37.273 --> 01:23:37.553
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

01:23:37.593 --> 01:23:37.993
[SPEAKER_07]: Winner!

01:23:38.293 --> 01:23:38.834
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

01:23:39.034 --> 01:23:39.474
[SPEAKER_12]: The winner's me.

01:23:39.574 --> 01:23:40.154
[SPEAKER_12]: Heart!

01:23:40.275 --> 01:23:40.835
[SPEAKER_07]: Level up!

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:43.436
[SPEAKER_07]: Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do!

01:23:44.197 --> 01:23:45.998
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, sorry, I just gained five stamina.

01:23:46.518 --> 01:23:49.800
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, what's... I'm sorry, you want Beatmania, Wii, what?

01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:49.900
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:23:50.942 --> 01:23:54.543
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you guys were talking about the Beatmania location test in Illinois.

01:23:55.263 --> 01:24:03.165
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm almost wondering if that's a precursor to the oft-rumored, talked-about Beatmania sequel coming to the consoles.

01:24:04.965 --> 01:24:19.889
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but we didn't see it at Gamers Day, which is a little bit of a, you know, it's not going to happen, but it is a little bit of a frowny face next to the idea, you know, because they did announce Beatmania 1 at Gamers Day last year, so, I mean, I would say it's still up in the air.

01:24:20.492 --> 01:24:21.713
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not familiar with Gamers Day.

01:24:21.733 --> 01:24:24.914
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they announce Supernova CS?

01:24:25.054 --> 01:24:30.996
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, we only ran about four stories on Gamers Day on the site, so I urge you to check out OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:24:31.536 --> 01:24:32.617
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, look at the website, kids.

01:24:33.757 --> 01:24:35.178
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you want to know about Gamers Day?

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:38.539
[SPEAKER_07]: Was Supernova CS announced last year?

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:40.900
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:43.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it may not have been.

01:24:43.261 --> 01:24:43.981
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have me there.

01:24:44.081 --> 01:24:45.402
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they did announce it.

01:24:45.802 --> 01:24:47.783
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they were showing Beatmania...

01:24:48.777 --> 01:24:52.721
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, and it was the Karaoke Revolution Country.

01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:54.102
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't show Supernova until E3.

01:24:54.663 --> 01:24:57.565
[SPEAKER_05]: They have that arcade machine there, and they announced Supernova for the console.

01:24:57.585 --> 01:24:58.726
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, that's right.

01:24:58.746 --> 01:25:01.909
[SPEAKER_07]: They made the announcement of Supernova in the arcades at Gamers Day last year.

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.551
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they said the consoles too, I think.

01:25:03.711 --> 01:25:07.895
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, and they said it was going to come to consoles, but they just didn't show the playable game.

01:25:08.175 --> 01:25:11.398
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, because Loki and I were toot our own horn here.

01:25:11.438 --> 01:25:13.580
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the first people in the country to play DDR Supernova.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.161
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:15.205 --> 01:25:17.046
[SPEAKER_12]: You didn't have to do the arm gestures, Ross.

01:25:17.107 --> 01:25:17.987
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants to touch me?

01:25:18.087 --> 01:25:19.148
[SPEAKER_12]: You look like you're trying to fly away.

01:25:19.168 --> 01:25:20.389
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that was a steel-toed boot.

01:25:21.810 --> 01:25:23.852
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so... I wouldn't wash that hand, by the way.

01:25:25.853 --> 01:25:25.973
[SPEAKER_12]: Ew.

01:25:28.555 --> 01:25:32.258
[SPEAKER_07]: Sephiroth1215 says the last consumer DDR shown at Gamers Day was extreme.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.461
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there you go.

01:25:36.301 --> 01:25:42.666
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, going back, I know Eddie was talking about how virtual console games are priced, you know, so expensively.

01:25:42.867 --> 01:25:43.327
[SPEAKER_08]: He sure was.

01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:47.876
[SPEAKER_08]: I could have put that on the N64 games.

01:25:47.956 --> 01:25:52.278
[SPEAKER_08]: I think $10 is stupid, especially since that system blew.

01:25:52.298 --> 01:25:54.380
[SPEAKER_08]: Pokemon Snap, motherfucker!

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.681
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd pay $10 for that.

01:25:55.881 --> 01:26:00.304
[SPEAKER_01]: About a year ago, they were announcing they were considering maybe having all the NES games be free.

01:26:00.524 --> 01:26:02.925
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I don't see why that would have been out of the question.

01:26:02.945 --> 01:26:05.647
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like you said, the games were like 20 years old.

01:26:05.687 --> 01:26:08.049
[SPEAKER_01]: They made their money off of them, and now it's like they're selling bits.

01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:10.791
[SPEAKER_07]: And I could go buy Animal Crossing and get half those games for free.

01:26:12.392 --> 01:26:12.792
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:26:12.812 --> 01:26:12.892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:26:13.993 --> 01:26:19.077
[SPEAKER_08]: But I honestly think that $8 for SNES games is a pretty fair price.

01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:21.979
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'd gladly pay $8 for Linkin Park.

01:26:22.019 --> 01:26:22.679
[SPEAKER_08]: Eddie disagrees.

01:26:23.159 --> 01:26:23.740
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you disagree?

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:24.280
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree, too.

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:24.721
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

01:26:24.821 --> 01:26:25.741
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you guys are poor.

01:26:27.422 --> 01:26:28.123
[SPEAKER_01]: In part, yes.

01:26:28.363 --> 01:26:29.724
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, it's just the whole thing.

01:26:29.744 --> 01:26:36.589
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand they have to pay for setting up for the retro console, but they don't have to pay for actually making cartridges, sending them out, shipping them out.

01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:39.331
[SPEAKER_07]: What if, like, they charge, like, one fee...

01:26:39.935 --> 01:26:40.696
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:27:02.341 --> 01:27:03.402
[SPEAKER_12]: Retro Reasons or whatever.

01:27:03.442 --> 01:27:05.523
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not like we really want to obtain the game.

01:27:06.084 --> 01:27:08.986
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, Nintendo's trying to target that new generation.

01:27:09.506 --> 01:27:12.728
[SPEAKER_08]: Half of the people who may be playing the Wii have never even played these games before.

01:27:13.308 --> 01:27:13.569
[SPEAKER_12]: True.

01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:15.190
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:15.410
[SPEAKER_07]: True dat.

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:17.992
[SPEAKER_12]: Doesn't mean they have to charge so much fucking money for it.

01:27:18.012 --> 01:27:26.437
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, though, I notice a lot of people that are getting into the Wii kind of like remember the old NES, like the old Mario Brothers and that stuff.

01:27:26.477 --> 01:27:28.799
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, you know, there's a certain nostalgia value to it, too.

01:27:29.924 --> 01:27:30.925
[SPEAKER_07]: DM, anything else for our listeners?

01:27:30.965 --> 01:27:31.005
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

01:27:57.590 --> 01:28:00.131
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100, Matt's going to be on STFU this week.

01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:00.751
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

01:28:00.991 --> 01:28:01.692
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be fun.

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:04.152
[SPEAKER_07]: STFU, Thursday nights, right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:04.352 --> 01:28:06.393
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I heard Jimmy was on Cross Platform this week.

01:28:07.614 --> 01:28:07.974
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard.

01:28:08.034 --> 01:28:09.834
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't tell me until a couple days ago.

01:28:10.194 --> 01:28:15.716
[SPEAKER_07]: How is it that you guys have accomplished more in 11, 12 weeks of your program than we've accomplished in five years?

01:28:18.817 --> 01:28:20.138
[SPEAKER_08]: We model your work ethic.

01:28:20.718 --> 01:28:22.038
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear DMN, I hate you.

01:28:22.198 --> 01:28:22.599
[SPEAKER_07]: Love, Rob.

01:28:23.279 --> 01:28:24.279
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, you don't.

01:28:24.559 --> 01:28:25.139
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right, I don't.

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:26.400
[SPEAKER_07]: Hugs and kisses, DMN.

01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:26.900
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't be a dick.

01:28:29.016 --> 01:28:29.437
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

01:28:30.437 --> 01:28:30.718
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:28:31.718 --> 01:28:37.382
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I'm going to make a show that counters STFU and it's going to be called DIAF.

01:28:38.543 --> 01:28:39.123
[SPEAKER_07]: Diet of Fire?

01:28:39.263 --> 01:28:39.544
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

01:28:39.564 --> 01:28:40.184
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll be good.

01:28:40.344 --> 01:28:42.666
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just going to be setting people on fire.

01:28:42.726 --> 01:28:43.326
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

01:28:44.187 --> 01:28:44.907
[SPEAKER_07]: Last minute stories.

01:28:44.927 --> 01:28:46.268
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around and get the last minute stories.

01:28:46.308 --> 01:28:47.429
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody have anything they want to share?

01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.929
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:49.070
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, StarkSakura.

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:49.951
[SPEAKER_03]: Rondo of Blood!

01:28:52.915 --> 01:28:56.758
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura will not be seen on next week's program, or any program afterwards, actually.

01:28:56.918 --> 01:28:59.140
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she'll be playing Rondo of Blood.

01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:01.201
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I did have something, though, off-topic.

01:29:01.562 --> 01:29:05.605
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually not going to be able to be live Tuesday, but the Tuesday after I will be.

01:29:06.085 --> 01:29:06.405
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

01:29:06.545 --> 01:29:07.726
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my midterms.

01:29:07.786 --> 01:29:09.408
[SPEAKER_07]: More Pump Up the Volume, goodness.

01:29:09.668 --> 01:29:11.449
[SPEAKER_02]: Pump Up the Volume will be back the week after next.

01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.310
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

01:29:13.511 --> 01:29:14.592
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you have anything last minute?

01:29:15.372 --> 01:29:16.153
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, nothing.

01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:16.833
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a first.

01:29:17.254 --> 01:29:17.614
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

01:29:18.455 --> 01:29:20.156
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't have anything either, so I guess that's it.

01:29:20.656 --> 01:29:22.238
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:22.258 --> 01:29:22.798
[SPEAKER_07]: Down the crapper.

01:29:24.212 --> 01:29:27.954
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

01:29:27.994 --> 01:29:28.554
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys rock.

01:29:29.095 --> 01:29:30.796
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:29:31.016 --> 01:29:32.537
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start off with our special guest tonight.

01:29:32.577 --> 01:29:33.577
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for being here.

01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:34.718
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess, your final thought.

01:29:39.101 --> 01:29:40.402
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a queef, not a fart.

01:29:40.782 --> 01:29:41.843
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you for clarifying.

01:29:41.863 --> 01:29:43.284
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

01:29:44.224 --> 01:29:46.626
[SPEAKER_07]: Casper the Gay, also known as Eddie, your final thought.

01:29:46.666 --> 01:29:49.488
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, don't join Rob's FaceSite thing.

01:29:49.528 --> 01:29:51.469
[SPEAKER_01]: Join my MySpace at W-I-I-D-D-Y.

01:29:52.785 --> 01:29:53.085
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

01:29:54.566 --> 01:29:54.847
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

01:29:56.047 --> 01:29:57.248
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Weed, I get it.

01:29:57.488 --> 01:30:00.430
[SPEAKER_07]: Weed D. I get it, because like Eddie, but Weed.

01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:02.212
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I'm really gay.

01:30:02.612 --> 01:30:04.633
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us, Rob.

01:30:04.734 --> 01:30:08.436
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought, and what are you shopping for on eBay right now?

01:30:08.616 --> 01:30:15.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Analog replacement for my new PSP that I'm going to be getting, since I want to repair it by Wednesday, so.

01:30:16.422 --> 01:30:21.245
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is, God, I wish Crackdown was out this week, but I have to wait another week.

01:30:22.126 --> 01:30:22.226
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo.

01:30:24.178 --> 01:30:30.860
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is reject false icons and I heart you, Jamie.

01:30:32.521 --> 01:30:33.361
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, your final thought.

01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:35.562
[SPEAKER_02]: Bondo of blood!

01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:39.223
[SPEAKER_02]: And my other obsession right now is Captain America.

01:30:40.023 --> 01:30:40.924
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great night, everybody.

01:30:40.944 --> 01:30:43.084
