7000	12000	There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco
14000	19000	Tonight, February 25th, 2007, plenty of new games from Virtual Console are discovered,
19000	22000	some Xbox 360 games are getting a price cut,
22000	26000	and one TV station warns us about sexual predators on online games.
26000	30000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
32000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange, Lounge, Radio.
37000	44000	Today is February 25th, 2007. We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, the gaming lifestyle.
44000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.
47000	50000	If you play games online, you might see me post on forums.
50000	54000	Not joining us tonight, sadly, is Dark Sakura, also known as Jamie Summers.
54000	57000	She had some prior family engagements to attend to.
57000	60000	We will be hearing from her in a special pre-taped segment later in the show,
60000	64000	but we've secretly replaced Dark Sakura with a furry gay man tonight.
64000	66000	Say hello to Eddie.
66000	68000	I'm Yummy.
68000	71000	Oh, Casper the Gay. Am I supposed to refer to you as Casper the Gay?
71000	73000	Yeah, pretty much. No, it's alright. I don't care.
73000	74000	Well, how are you doing, Casper?
74000	77000	I'm great. I came down here having a good time.
77000	84000	You remember those old commercials that's like, we secretly replaced so-and-so's Folgers with the new DeCap.
84000	85000	I don't know what the hell it is.
85000	89000	I feel like we secretly replaced Jamie with a furry gay man.
89000	92000	And they'll never know.
92000	96000	Alright, well, also joining us tonight, the one and only tech master, Loki.
96000	97000	Hello.
97000	100000	And we did not replace him with a furry gay man.
100000	101000	Thank God.
101000	102000	Or did we?
102000	103000	No, we didn't.
103000	104000	Alright, how are you doing, Loki?
104000	105000	I'm doing fine.
105000	110000	Good, good to hear. I'm glad to see you're eating healthy tonight with the old Mickey D's.
110000	114000	You know, their sweet and sour sauce tastes like it's been sitting out for a long time.
114000	116000	It tastes a little off.
116000	124000	But that does not mean that I'm not gonna, you know, and I'm also disappointed that I only got two packets of sweet and sour sauce versus three, because three's a lot better.
124000	127000	Doesn't McDonald's have some stupid policy, like if you order yay so many nuggets?
127000	129000	Yeah, but ten pieces, I'm supposed to get three.
129000	131000	They fucking jit me.
131000	133000	Why don't you go in and ask to speak with the manager?
133000	134000	Because I don't care.
134000	135000	You should be one of those people.
135000	148000	I'm sure anybody in our chat room who's worked for fast food in the past has some story about some fucking bitch who came in there because they wanted extra sauce or, you know, oh, you gotta let the people to drive through who order like,
148000	156000	I want a super-sized burger, chicken McNuggets, super-sized fries, oh, and a Diet Coke.
156000	161000	Or even better, I want a six-piece McNugget with 12 sides of sweet and sour sauce.
161000	164000	That's right, it makes me angsty.
164000	166000	Makes me angsty.
166000	168000	God damn it, that's the second week in a row that's happened.
168000	170000	That's more than a second week in a row.
170000	171000	That's been like four weeks in a row.
171000	173000	I've been doing it on purpose.
173000	174000	All right.
174000	176000	Say hello as well tonight to, uh...
176000	177000	Murder!
177000	179000	Say hello to Rice Princess.
179000	180000	How you doing, Rice Princess?
180000	183000	Now's when you're supposed to cue one wing angel when I come...
183000	184000	That's all right.
184000	185000	How you doing, Rice Princess?
185000	186000	I'm doing pretty good.
186000	187000	I'm eating McDonald's, too.
187000	188000	Very healthy.
188000	190000	I'm eating McDonald's, too.
190000	191000	Is this loud enough?
191000	192000	Yeah, see?
192000	194000	Now, tonight I'm letting you see the monitor so you can see when you're loud enough.
194000	197000	Can I have a not-crappy mic to talk into?
197000	198000	No.
198000	201000	Because I hate yelling and making it sound like I'm falling off a cliff.
201000	202000	All right.
202000	203000	How you doing, though, otherwise?
203000	204000	Pretty good.
204000	205000	All right.
205000	206000	Yep.
206000	207000	All right.
207000	208000	Well, also say hello to our chat room.
208000	209000	Always another guest here on the program.
209000	212000	It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
212000	214000	Hello, I am the chat room.
214000	216000	I noticed Tiger Claw in chat room says,
216000	220000	Sky, you do know the Oscars are on?
220000	221000	Yep.
221000	223000	Well, last week it was the Grammys, or two weeks ago it was the Grammys.
223000	224000	This week it's the Oscars.
224000	225000	We just can't win.
225000	226000	We're always up against something.
226000	228000	I mean, but come on.
228000	229000	Who cares?
229000	231000	You're going to be able to read it tomorrow morning who won the Oscars.
231000	232000	And let's be honest.
232000	237000	You and I both know most people listen to this show in the audio archive or podcast form.
237000	241000	And they can listen to that in the convenience of whenever they want.
241000	243000	So it won't be up against the Oscars in that regard.
243000	245000	So we have to just keep doing a show like always.
245000	248000	Because if you want, I mean, if you don't want us to talk about video games,
248000	253000	we could just kind of like turn on the Oscars and just give live commentary.
253000	254000	God Kate Winslet looks fat.
254000	256000	Wouldn't that be fun?
256000	257000	I did see a deal.
257000	259000	I will say Oscar chat real fast even though, you know,
259000	261000	we're supposed to be keeping the random down tonight.
261000	263000	I will say I saw that in Notes on a Scandal,
263000	265000	which is the one that Judi Dench is nominated for.
265000	267000	I went out and saw that last night.
267000	268000	It's pretty good.
268000	269000	Pretty good.
269000	270000	Judi Dench plays a good, crazy old woman.
270000	271000	She really does.
271000	272000	I hope she wins.
272000	273000	But I hear that I didn't see the queen.
273000	274000	I hear that was really good too.
274000	277000	But Judi Dench, has she ever been bad in any movie?
277000	278000	I don't think she has.
278000	279000	Nope.
279000	280000	I don't think she has.
280000	281000	All right.
281000	285000	Joshi16 in the chat room has some harsh words for the podcast listeners.
285000	289000	He said podcast equals lazy fans.
289000	290000	Ouch.
290000	291000	Ouch.
291000	292000	Burn.
292000	293000	All right.
293000	295000	Well, let's get right into how we always start off the show,
295000	297000	a little bit of how is your gaming week,
297000	299000	where we talk about what we've been playing.
299000	301000	And usually our chat room gets into it too.
301000	303000	Oh, first off, speaking of chat room, I want to say hi to the new listeners.
303000	306000	I always make a chance to try to say hi to noobs that are in chat.
306000	308000	Level 10 noob.
308000	309000	Misty's not a noob.
309000	310000	She's a long-time listener.
310000	311000	She's in chat tonight.
311000	312000	She hasn't been there for a long time.
312000	313000	So hi, Misty.
313000	314000	Frisbee.
314000	315000	I don't recognize that name.
315000	318000	And if I'm mistakenly pegging you as the new listener, I miss you.
318000	319000	I apologize.
319000	321000	My brain can only hold so much.
321000	324000	I don't recognize Heon64.
324000	325000	That must be new.
325000	326000	So welcome.
326000	327000	Proper T. Roboboy.
327000	329000	Actually, maybe there's been a Roboboy before.
329000	330000	I don't know.
330000	331000	Roboboy, I don't recognize you.
331000	335000	Noobs or people I'm calling noobs because I didn't recognize your name.
335000	336000	Welcome to chat.
336000	339000	We have a lot of folks in chat tonight, a lot of regulars in there.
339000	340000	We appreciate your support as always.
340000	343000	But again, if you can't listen to us live because some of you guys have other things
343000	347000	to do on Sunday nights like Oscar parties or whatever stupid stuff you're doing,
347000	349000	you can always download our podcast.
349000	350000	Send us e-mails.
350000	351000	Mailbag and orangeontrader.com.
351000	352000	Leave us voicemails.
352000	353000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
353000	354000	Okay, I'll shut up.
354000	356000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
356000	358000	My gaming week was good.
358000	360000	It was all crackdown.
360000	364500	It's lots of crackdown and the game is awesome except some co-op, depending on who you're
364500	368000	playing with, I guess, can be very buggy or very laggy.
368000	376000	Like, I played a co-op game with Jeremy Todd 1 today and yeah, it was pretty bad.
376000	379000	Like, I couldn't even move around and stuff.
379000	380000	It was that laggy.
380000	386000	But, and then again, I played another co-op game earlier in the week with Da Money.
386000	390000	I don't remember the rest of the name on there, but that was pretty cool.
390000	393000	And that was pretty fun because we were car surfing in that.
393000	397000	I stood on top of his car and he was driving really fast and I was firing rockets at other
397000	399000	cars coming by and it was hilarious.
399000	401000	Couldn't stop laughing.
401000	403000	So, that's pretty fun.
403000	405000	But the game itself is just really keeping my attention.
405000	410000	I'm hoping for some good download content later on because I think once I do finish
410000	414000	the game and finally do get the rest of the achievements, it might just kind of crash
414000	419000	for me because you need to have some really good co-op stuff to be able to get a lot out
419000	420000	of the game.
420000	422000	But, it's fun so far though.
422000	423000	I love it.
423000	431000	Then, of course, you know, the typical Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and I got a second
431000	433000	PSP that I'm fixing.
433000	437000	It's all fixed now, but I have to order a new faceplate button for it because I bought
437000	440000	this third-party faceplate for it and it sucks balls.
440000	446000	So, I always stick with first-party stuff because the third-party clear ones, they suck.
446000	452000	I think that's all I've really played other than, you know, just Crackdown.
452000	454000	So, yeah, kind of slow.
454000	456000	Well, Crackdown is what a lot of people have been playing.
456000	461000	I haven't signed on to the Xbox a lot this week because I've been playing a lot of World
461000	465000	of Warcraft, but I have noticed a lot of people on my friends list have been playing Crackdown
465000	468000	because I actually do sign on the web to check my messages.
468000	472000	Like, you know, if I'm, you know, just because I get messages from listeners once in a while
472000	475000	like, hey, how come you're only playing shitty games or hey, how come I haven't seen you
475000	476000	in a while?
476000	477000	So, I'll write.
477000	478000	As long as it's text messages.
478000	480000	If I get voice messages, it's harder to check those online.
480000	483000	But, I do respond to all of them as I get them.
483000	488000	I think from what I've been reading and what I've experienced so far, the co-op is broken
488000	490000	a little bit on Crackdown.
490000	492000	You can't invite people.
492000	497000	You can open your game up and then they can join it, but the inviting is broken.
497000	499000	So that's supposed to be fixed in a later patch.
499000	502000	So, when are you going to let me play Crackdown so I can decide if it's worth the 60 bucks
502000	503000	or not?
503000	504000	Well, I still want to play it.
504000	505000	All right.
505000	508000	Well, you're going to come over at some point and show it to me, right?
508000	510000	I had it here today.
510000	512000	I didn't get the demo, quote unquote.
512000	513000	I didn't get it.
513000	514000	Like, I suck at those types of games.
514000	519000	Oh, maybe you can see my save game where you can fire homing missiles at people.
519000	520000	All right.
520000	522000	Let's see, what else?
522000	523000	That's if you're a GamingWig?
523000	524000	That's it.
524000	528000	GamingWig was mostly World of War crack, as I said, Kid Icarus a lot on Nintendo.
528000	529000	Dude, that game, it's awesome.
529000	531000	It's hard as hell, but it's fun.
531000	532000	That's the hardest game ever.
532000	536000	Dude, when I beat the first dungeon this week, I thought I was the shit because I'm like,
536000	539000	oh my gosh, I'm over 21 and I can still beat the first dungeon.
539000	541000	I still have some skill at this game.
541000	542000	Yes.
542000	543000	It was like getting to hear the theme.
543000	548000	How many people have actually heard other music in the game besides the very first stage?
548000	549000	Not a lot.
549000	550000	Exactly.
550000	555000	Most people have only heard the first stage music, so it's kind of neat to hear the second
555000	556000	stage theme.
556000	559000	Anyway, I'm sure there's a lot of listeners, though, that are like, I already beat the
559000	560000	game, Rob.
560000	561000	What's taking you so long?
561000	564000	Yeah, I'm nine years old and I beat the game like 500 times.
564000	567000	Dude, when I was nine years old, I beat the game 500 times, too.
567000	568000	Shut up.
568000	571000	But also, I used Icarus Fights Medusa Angels.
571000	577000	Anyway, also, I went to the arcade this week, which was kind of cool because I had a date
577000	582000	Friday, and he actually wanted to go to the arcade because we didn't really have a set
582000	587000	plan, but he's kind of got a dorky side to him, so he had suggested we go to the arcade.
587000	590000	Dude, he made me play seven games of DDR.
590000	592000	It was awesome.
592000	595000	We played seven games of DDR.
595000	599000	I'm having a whole new respect for DDR Supernova, which I have yet to really have played a whole
599000	601000	lot of, which is cool.
601000	603000	Then I played DDR Disney Mix, a lot of dumb stuff.
603000	607000	But then we played some old school games I haven't played forever, like Soul Calibur 2.
607000	612000	I played Soul Calibur 2, and first off, Young Sung is awesome.
612000	616000	Usually, I play female characters in games because they're better in fighting games.
616000	617000	They're more agile, usually.
617000	620000	But Young Sung is the best character in Soul Calibur, hands down.
620000	625000	I made it all the way to the boss, so I know that machine was set on easy because I suck
625000	626000	at Soul Calibur.
626000	628000	You're like, what's going on?
628000	629000	That's exactly what I said.
629000	632000	I kept winning, and I looked at my date and I said, I don't know why I keep winning.
632000	633000	I'm sorry.
633000	635000	You're just standing there the whole time.
635000	636000	You're not even pushing any buttons.
636000	638000	I'm really sorry that I'm winning.
638000	641000	Hey, what's going on?
641000	644000	No, to answer chat, I do not have a boyfriend.
644000	646000	I think he listens to this once in a while.
646000	647000	I went on a date.
647000	648000	There's a big difference.
648000	649000	Oh, God.
649000	653000	Anyway, I shouldn't talk about my personal life on this program.
653000	654000	Yeah, you should.
654000	655000	I really shouldn't.
655000	659000	Oh, I played Mario Kart Arcade, which was fun, because they fixed their machine at Golf
659000	661000	Land, and now the picture camera thing works again.
661000	662000	It's a lot of fun.
662000	663000	I actually won the race.
663000	664000	I'm getting good at Mario Kart Arcade.
664000	665000	That must be on easy, too.
665000	667000	No, we played a normal track.
667000	668000	We didn't play the easiest one.
668000	669000	We played on normal.
669000	670000	True.
670000	671000	No, I swear.
671000	673000	That game's a waste of money, man.
673000	674000	It's kind of hokey.
674000	678000	Mario Kart in the arcade does not nearly have the same magic as it does at home.
678000	683000	Why don't you just take a picture of yourself and tape it to the screen if you really want
683000	684000	your face on the thing?
684000	688000	It would be better if you had eight of those machines.
688000	691000	Then it would be better with the pictures.
691000	694000	I could see Dave and Busters having all these machines next to each other.
694000	696000	In fact, I bet there's a Dave and Buster somewhere that has it.
696000	699000	But when you only have two, it is kind of hokey.
699000	701000	And the game itself is not the same magic as the home.
701000	702000	It's really not.
702000	704000	It's like a whole different engine or something.
704000	709000	If you want to see the Mario Kart Arcade, by the way, search for Orange Lounge on YouTube,
709000	711000	and there's a video of Loki playing Mario Kart drunk.
711000	712000	It's hilarious.
712000	713000	At his bachelor party.
713000	714000	Awesome.
714000	715000	Yeah.
715000	716000	We need to put more crap on YouTube.
716000	718000	Eddie, you're a camera person, right?
718000	721000	Yeah, I have a digital camera where we can download stuff.
721000	722000	Yeah.
722000	723000	Just took it up to the USB.
723000	724000	You need to do video.
724000	726000	You need to be like our official Orange Lounge videographer.
726000	727000	Seriously, yeah.
727000	728000	That's what I'll do.
728000	729000	That'll be rad.
729000	730000	Let's do that.
730000	731000	It's on.
731000	732000	All right.
732000	733000	It's on.
733000	734000	All right.
734000	736000	Anyhow, let's go around and figure out some other gaming weeks.
736000	739000	Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
739000	741000	Oh, more wow.
741000	742000	Yep.
742000	743000	Good times on there.
743000	749000	Oh, I'm so happy because like my 29 Rogue on Elder Thallus, I got some poor sap to give
749000	752000	me a plus 15 agi on my dagger.
752000	753000	That's kind of expensive.
753000	755000	Did you just call it agi?
755000	756000	Agility.
756000	757000	It's agility.
757000	758000	Agility.
758000	759000	I call it agi.
759000	760000	Agi is how you abbreviate it.
760000	761000	That's like me saying-
761000	763000	Agi is going to be a punch in your face.
763000	766000	Oh, Rice Princess, you make me lull.
766000	768000	Oh, Rob.
768000	769000	Deaf, please.
769000	770000	Please.
770000	773000	Rob, I've got to heal it in.
773000	775000	Rolled full of mao.
775000	777000	Rolled full of mao.
777000	778000	JK.
778000	779000	Anyway.
779000	780000	Oh my gosh.
780000	782000	Now I'm going to leave.
782000	784000	No, but yeah, it's pretty much been wow.
784000	785000	Whoop dee doo.
785000	786000	Good wow times.
786000	791000	I played for about, I don't know, like an hour, hour and a half on Back Me Wool, and
791000	792000	I did two quests.
792000	794000	I don't even know why I went on.
794000	795000	I'm like, man.
795000	798000	And they were in the Barrens, so you know how you could do like 10 quests at the same
798000	799000	time in the Barrens?
799000	802000	I'm like, I'll just not do anything.
802000	804000	Because you got tied up in Barrens Chat?
804000	806000	No, I got tied up in G Chat, yo.
806000	807000	Oh, I'm sorry.
807000	808000	Guild Chat.
808000	809000	Let's not abbreviate that.
809000	810000	Yes, please.
810000	811000	Thank you.
811000	812000	Yeah.
812000	813000	Guild Chat.
813000	814000	Sorry.
814000	815000	So, yeah.
815000	818000	Did you actually sign on to the Guild and go, what up, G?
818000	819000	No.
819000	820000	No, just curious.
820000	822000	Eddie, how was your gaming week?
822000	823000	It was awesome.
823000	825000	I've been doing the virtual console thing too, so I got Donkey Kong Country.
825000	827000	Oh my god, that game still kicks ass.
827000	828000	I love that game.
828000	831000	Yeah, but it's not as good because I have GameCube controllers for my Wii instead of
831000	834000	the classic controllers, and that doesn't work.
834000	835000	But it's still fun.
835000	838000	Like, because you can't run and jump at the same time because of the way that the X and
838000	840000	the B buttons are positioned on the GameCube controller.
840000	842000	So, it's still awesome, though.
842000	844000	Like, nobody else cares, though.
844000	845000	Yeah, we don't.
845000	849000	But yeah, I also got Kid Icarus, and that game is the hardest game I've ever played
849000	852000	in like 27 years of video gaming.
852000	854000	It's ridiculous.
854000	856000	I'm trying to think of games that are harder than Kid Icarus.
856000	858000	Battletoads, if they ever put Battletoads.
858000	859000	Battletoads, oh my god, I love that game.
859000	860000	That is great.
860000	861000	Virtual console, you are fucked.
861000	863000	No, I love, because you can attack your partner.
863000	866000	Because you know that's one of those like two players at the same time, like Contra?
866000	867000	You could like double dragon.
867000	869000	You could attack your friend.
869000	870000	Yeah.
870000	871000	It's awesome.
871000	872000	Totally.
872000	873000	Rygar is pretty hard.
873000	874000	I love Rygar.
874000	875000	So do I.
875000	876000	But it's hard.
876000	881000	Like, try getting to the last boss without a fucking game genie code or something.
881000	882000	If you have a normal NES.
882000	886000	Wasn't Rygar so hard because you couldn't save it, or you couldn't, like you had to
886000	887000	beat it one city?
887000	888000	I don't think there was a, yeah.
888000	889000	You had to do it.
889000	890000	You had to beat it one city.
890000	891000	And you could only continue I think so many times too.
891000	892000	Yeah.
892000	893000	So, it was pretty hard.
893000	895000	Yeah, that's how all games were back in the day though.
895000	897000	Yeah, I guess.
897000	898000	Alright.
898000	899000	Uh huh.
899000	901000	I'm looking at what's going on in chat room.
901000	904000	JV Mon says, Sky, are you fucking with Rice Princess's volume?
904000	908000	Yes, sorry, if you are noticing audio problems, I'm fucking with her volume as she's talking
908000	911000	because Rice Princess has a naturally quiet voice.
911000	912000	I'm trying to be loud.
912000	915000	See, oh man, am I like super loud now?
915000	917000	Like, can two people in China hear me now?
917000	918000	I think we're good.
918000	919000	Oh, okay.
919000	922000	But make sure if Loki talks, he uses this mic and not the one you're on.
922000	923000	Okay.
923000	924000	Okay.
924000	925000	Thank you.
925000	926000	Alright.
926000	930000	Because I guess the guys in studio have louder voices anyway, not that you guys want to know
930000	931000	that.
931000	933000	Eddie, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
933000	934000	Nope.
934000	935000	Alright.
935000	937000	Let's get into some gaming news then.
937000	939000	Oh, first actually, some housekeeping.
939000	942000	First off, obviously Dark Sakura's not here tonight.
942000	944000	You will be hearing her in a tape segment in part B though.
944000	948000	She still is joining us for the mailbag, so Dark Sakura fans have that to look forward
948000	950000	to in our B segment.
950000	954000	And also in our B segment tonight, which I'm making the first half of the show sound really
954000	957000	boring, but an old favorite from OLR comes back tonight.
957000	959000	You asked for it.
959000	961000	Tonight we're going to play some Beat the Host.
961000	962000	Tonight is Beat the Host.
962000	964000	Literally, we're going to be beating Robin Elle.
964000	965000	Oh, can I like punch you in the face?
965000	966000	No, you don't actually Beat the Host.
966000	967000	Oh, man, dammit.
967000	969000	I know you guys are kind of new to Beat the Host.
969000	972000	Beat the Host is we're changing the format a little bit for Beat the Host tonight, but
972000	975000	it's basically how well do you know your video game music.
975000	978000	And a listener gets to take on a host of their choosing.
978000	983000	I'm going to tell you what, if you don't have a knowledge of classic arcade games tonight,
983000	984000	don't even bother.
984000	985000	Okay, then don't pick me.
985000	988000	Don't even try tonight because it's going to be killer.
988000	990000	It's way harder than any of the others we've done, I think.
990000	992000	There are some that are easy, but some are hard.
992000	993000	We'll get into that in part B.
993000	995000	I was like five years old when the arcade games were popular.
995000	996000	I know, so don't pick me.
996000	998000	Well, then you better pick Loki, I guess.
998000	1000000	He might be the only challenge in here.
1000000	1001000	We'll see.
1001000	1005000	Or you can pick Rice Princess just to embarrass her with her lack of classic arcade knowledge,
1005000	1006000	so this will be fun.
1006000	1008000	All right, we'll see what happens.
1008000	1009000	That would suck.
1009000	1015000	All right, let's move on and go into some gaming news this week, starting off with some
1015000	1016000	virtual console news.
1016000	1021000	We're going to talk about a new feature that has shown up on the virtual console, but not
1021000	1022000	in this country.
1022000	1023000	It's over in the UK.
1023000	1027000	What's interesting is that a new bonus is now waiting for them on the front page when
1027000	1028000	they log in.
1028000	1030000	It's not a very well-hidden secret.
1030000	1032000	It looks a little text-drawn smiley.
1032000	1035000	What happens when you go into it, it's the Warp Zone.
1035000	1038000	It's this new area on the Wii called the Nintendo Warp Zone.
1038000	1042000	What the Warp Zone has is just some trivia and cool stuff.
1042000	1044000	Right now, what they have on there is some little Kirby trivia.
1044000	1048000	They have Kirby history and Kirby trivia, which would make sense because obviously the
1048000	1049000	Kirby game.
1049000	1051000	Did they get the Kirby game in Europe released on their console yet?
1051000	1052000	I know we got it here.
1052000	1057000	I'm assuming Kirby Europe, if they don't already have it, isn't far behind.
1057000	1064000	That is kind of opening the potential to having this cool little Nintendo fan niche center
1064000	1066000	that is possible to show up on the Wii.
1066000	1069000	I'm betting if the UK has it, we're going to get it any day now here in the US.
1069000	1070000	They also did a new channel.
1070000	1071000	They did the Everybody Votes channel.
1071000	1072000	That's last week's news.
1072000	1074000	Yeah, but they could have that on that too.
1074000	1077000	You could vote on different Nintendo trivia.
1077000	1080000	That's what a lot of people are saying they should have done with the Everybody Votes
1080000	1081000	channels.
1081000	1083000	They should have had Nintendo trivia and stuff.
1083000	1084000	Who do you like better?
1084000	1086000	Mario, Luigi, that type of thing.
1086000	1090000	Instead, they decided to waste the whole space of my channel block here.
1090000	1094000	Granted, I know it's an optional download, but you know what though?
1094000	1095000	It's still retarded.
1095000	1097000	It's just like the news channel.
1097000	1098000	That's retarded too.
1098000	1099000	And the weather channel.
1099000	1101000	The weather channel, great.
1101000	1105000	I get to find out what the weather was at midnight.
1105000	1106000	Like hours ago.
1106000	1108000	The forecast works fine.
1108000	1110000	It's lame.
1110000	1112000	It's better than nothing.
1112000	1114000	It's better than nothing.
1114000	1115000	Right?
1115000	1118000	The music in the forecast channel is off.
1118000	1119000	Okay.
1119000	1120000	Obviously, I'm reaching.
1120000	1121000	I'm sorry.
1121000	1124000	JV Mon says, I use the weather channel.
1124000	1128000	GS68 is calling Loki the resident Wii hater.
1128000	1130000	I think that's not true.
1130000	1131000	Loki loves his Wii.
1131000	1132000	Right.
1132000	1136000	I totally hate my Wii that I bought with tons of games and stuff.
1136000	1139000	You didn't have to camp out because of distribution, but whatever.
1139000	1141000	You got on launch day or before.
1141000	1143000	No, you had your Wii like three days before launch.
1143000	1147000	I remember going over there playing that horrible, horrible Red Steel.
1147000	1152000	We didn't play Red Steel the first day, but you played at the party and that was awful.
1152000	1153000	It doesn't matter.
1153000	1154000	Nobody cares.
1154000	1155000	No, it's not okay with players.
1155000	1156000	No, Red Steel.
1156000	1157000	It's a horrible game.
1157000	1158000	Alright.
1158000	1159000	Horrible game.
1159000	1160000	Most person shooters and shooters are though.
1160000	1163000	No, just Red Steel because Red Steel sucks balls.
1163000	1166000	Anyways, one thing that will not suck balls, hopefully,
1166000	1171000	is going to be some Neo Geo and MSX games coming to the Virtual Console.
1171000	1175000	And the first couple titles, at least the MSX titles,
1175000	1178000	and this is going to be on the Japanese service, of course, for right now,
1178000	1183000	Eggie and Alest are going to be the first MSX titles
1183000	1186000	and they're going to be 800 Wii points each.
1186000	1189000	Then both are due out in spring.
1189000	1193000	Hopefully we'll see some more SNK stuff come over.
1193000	1199000	Personally, I would hope for Magical Lord and No Metal Slug
1199000	1201000	because, my God, how many times do they even read?
1201000	1202000	Oh, I don't know.
1202000	1204000	How about Fatal Fury Special,
1204000	1206000	one of my favorite fighting games ever next to Street Fighter.
1206000	1208000	Are you being sarcastic?
1208000	1210000	No, I fucking love Fatal Fury Special.
1210000	1211000	I like Fatal Fury.
1211000	1212000	I like King of Fighters.
1212000	1214000	Samurai Showdown.
1214000	1217000	They need Samurai Showdown because that was great too.
1217000	1220000	Or the best fucking game on Neo Geo ever,
1220000	1224000	Magical Drop.
1224000	1226000	Or King of Monsters, I think.
1226000	1228000	Yeah, good times.
1228000	1230000	That's very interesting because did they say that at launch
1230000	1232000	that they were going to partner with Neo Geo?
1232000	1233000	I don't think they did.
1233000	1234000	I remember hearing about MSX.
1234000	1236000	I remember MSX, which was very exciting
1236000	1237000	because a lot of people were going,
1237000	1239000	ooh, now we can get the true sequel to Metal Gear
1239000	1241000	and all that stuff that was only on the MSX,
1241000	1242000	like the Metal Gear 2,
1242000	1245000	not that SNK's Revenge stuff we had here in the US.
1245000	1249000	Or just being able to play the original Metal Gear in the MSX format
1249000	1251000	might be kind of interesting.
1251000	1253000	They could like retranslate it so that you don't have,
1253000	1255000	you know, the truck have started to move.
1255000	1257000	No, they should keep that in there.
1257000	1258000	You like that?
1258000	1259000	Yeah.
1259000	1260000	All right.
1260000	1261000	What were the other translations in that?
1261000	1262000	I'm getting sleepy.
1262000	1266000	I fall asleep or something like that.
1266000	1267000	Yeah, probably.
1267000	1268000	I don't know.
1268000	1269000	Forget it.
1269000	1270000	So I'm excited.
1270000	1274000	Any other MSX or Neo Geo games you'd want to see?
1274000	1276000	I'm not really familiar with the MSX too much,
1276000	1277000	so I don't know.
1277000	1279000	What was the name of that game,
1279000	1282000	Blue's Journey or Blue's Adventure or something like that?
1282000	1283000	Blue's Clues?
1283000	1284000	No.
1284000	1285000	We just figured out Blue's Clues.
1285000	1286000	We just figured out Blue's Clues.
1286000	1287000	You can get off the show now.
1287000	1290000	No, it was the one where he like had,
1290000	1292000	never mind, nobody knows what I'm talking about.
1292000	1293000	Forget it.
1293000	1294000	Jerks.
1294000	1296000	What was I going to say?
1296000	1298000	What else on Neo Geo?
1298000	1301000	Oh, as long as we don't get 50,000 clones of Puzzle Bobble,
1301000	1302000	like there were in the arcade.
1302000	1303000	Yeah.
1303000	1304000	Like every year there's a new Puzzle Bobble,
1304000	1306000	and it's always the same damn game.
1306000	1307000	It's the same game every year.
1307000	1309000	Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of that,
1309000	1312000	even though I love like puzzle games and stuff.
1312000	1315000	Shadow Charlie wants to see Super Baseball 2020.
1315000	1316000	Okay.
1316000	1318000	Rob D wants to see King of Fighters 98.
1318000	1319000	Hell yeah.
1319000	1320000	Lots of King of Fighters games too.
1320000	1321000	All the King of Fighters games.
1321000	1323000	But I don't mind seeing new ones of those every year.
1323000	1324000	Yeah, seriously.
1324000	1325000	That's awesome.
1325000	1326000	Yeah, they need to like keep making them.
1326000	1327000	Thank you.
1327000	1328000	Hitstun remembers the translation,
1328000	1329000	I feel asleep.
1329000	1331000	It was I feel asleep.
1331000	1332000	That's awesome.
1332000	1333000	Thank you, Hitstun.
1333000	1335000	Gold star for you.
1335000	1336000	Yep.
1336000	1339000	All right, let's see.
1339000	1341000	Moving on with some other gaming news.
1341000	1344000	This, oh my gosh, this makes me so excited.
1344000	1349000	Square Enix is moving to put their first virtual console title on the Wii in Japan.
1349000	1350000	Yes.
1350000	1351000	And if I tell you Square Enix is putting,
1351000	1352000	unless you've already heard this,
1352000	1353000	don't guess you've already heard,
1353000	1355000	but if I told you Square Enix was putting a game on virtual console,
1355000	1358000	what would you think it is?
1358000	1359000	Square Enix.
1359000	1361000	Like the original Final Fantasy, right?
1361000	1362000	That's what Eddie's saying, Final Fantasy?
1362000	1363000	Yeah, I would agree.
1363000	1364000	No, it's even better.
1364000	1367000	It's like one of my favorite Super Nintendo games ever,
1367000	1369000	next to Final Fantasy III, VI, whatever you want to say.
1369000	1371000	Oh my God, what is it, Rom?
1371000	1372000	Actraiser.
1372000	1373000	Oh my God.
1373000	1375000	That game's so awesome.
1375000	1378000	I played that on a ROM, which I don't do because that's illegal,
1378000	1380000	but I did play that and that's like a,
1380000	1383000	it's like a cross between SimCity and like a side-scroller adventure game.
1383000	1384000	And sex.
1384000	1385000	And awesomeness.
1385000	1390000	Because it's like, no, you know what really makes Actraiser is Yuzo Koshiro.
1390000	1391000	And music, right?
1391000	1396000	The music in Actraiser is one of the most phenomenal soundtracks ever, ever.
1396000	1398000	And for those of you guys that are listening live tonight,
1398000	1400000	you're actually going to get a treat during our break.
1400000	1402000	We can't play it on the podcast because it's copyright,
1402000	1404000	but you're going to get Actraiser music during the break tonight
1404000	1405000	because I love it that much.
1405000	1407000	So, Sky, when's that coming out on virtual console?
1407000	1409000	Well, we don't know yet.
1409000	1410000	Exactly.
1410000	1412000	We know it's going to be March in Japan.
1412000	1415000	So, you know, but that's a good sign that it'll probably make its way over here
1415000	1417000	like end of March, April.
1417000	1418000	That's awesome.
1418000	1420000	I can't, I'm so downloading this.
1420000	1422000	Actraiser 2 wasn't even that bad.
1422000	1424000	It's just that they took out the simulation element of the game.
1424000	1425000	The simulation was fun.
1425000	1427000	I mean, it was like a Greek, you know,
1427000	1429000	you were developing a Greek civilization or whatever.
1429000	1431000	But Actraiser, seriously,
1431000	1434000	the only problem with Actraiser is that you can blast through the game
1434000	1435000	in about four hours.
1435000	1436000	Well, maybe long.
1436000	1437000	Maybe just about four hours.
1437000	1439000	I remember beating it when I rented it in one night.
1439000	1441000	That's pretty similar to a lot of old games.
1441000	1443000	I mean, especially NES games.
1443000	1446000	Like, you could get through them in a couple hours.
1446000	1448000	Yeah, so that's okay.
1448000	1450000	Yeah, I'm so freaking excited.
1450000	1451000	That's awesome.
1451000	1455000	A lot of folks in chat don't seem to know what Actraiser is in chat.
1455000	1457000	Highon64, I'm sorry if I mispronounced that,
1457000	1459000	says, don't be ashamed, GS68.
1459000	1460000	I don't know what Actraiser is either.
1460000	1462000	Seriously, go online.
1462000	1464000	Go to Wikipedia and look it up or download the ROM,
1464000	1466000	although I didn't tell you to do that.
1466000	1467000	It's awesome.
1467000	1468000	What's funny is it was in that,
1468000	1469000	because in Super Nintendo when they first came out,
1469000	1471000	they had like a strategy guide.
1471000	1473000	It was basically showcasing all the Super Nintendo games
1473000	1474000	were going to come out.
1474000	1475000	And it was in that.
1475000	1478000	But I don't think it got a lot of coverage and like advertising
1478000	1480000	and I don't think anybody knew about it.
1480000	1482000	It was definitely more of a cult game, I think.
1482000	1485000	I think so, too, because I never played it when I was younger.
1485000	1488000	Don't see a lot of those games that cross genres.
1488000	1491000	And that's why Actraiser 2 was kind of forgettable,
1491000	1494000	whereas Actraiser 1, you had those, you know,
1494000	1497000	side-scrolling action stages like the ghosts and goblins type theme
1497000	1500000	with just this most beautiful music you've ever heard in a Super Nintendo game
1500000	1503000	mixed with simulation scenes that are so different,
1503000	1505000	but they blend in the game so well,
1505000	1506000	because you get things in the simulation scene,
1506000	1508000	you use in the action scene.
1508000	1511000	I mean, one of the all-time greatest games.
1511000	1512000	Seriously.
1512000	1513000	Okay, am I thinking of the right game
1513000	1515000	where you're like an angel and you go and you like...
1515000	1516000	Yes, so you can see its little butt.
1516000	1519000	Yeah, pervert, you only you would know that.
1519000	1522000	You're like, ugh, hot angel butt.
1522000	1524000	For the rest of the time you're like a god.
1524000	1525000	Yeah, that's, or like, I don't know.
1525000	1527000	You're an angel and you're like planning crops or something like that
1527000	1528000	and you like...
1528000	1529000	In the side-scroll, you're a god.
1529000	1530000	Oh really?
1530000	1531000	In the side-scroll is you're a god?
1531000	1531000	Is that what you said, Eddie?
1531000	1533440	Is that what you said Eddie? Yes, okay
1534400	1539000	That's great. I guess I didn't play enough of it. No. Yeah, that was that was a whole theme of the game
1539000	1540640	You were God. Oh
1540640	1545340	Yeah, and you had to go down to earth to fix the suffering and it's actually actually like the music
1546280	1549120	Fits the emotion of the game like so well, I'm sorry
1549120	1554640	I sound like such a ham, but it's true. Like it's one of the early great like it's so great. Did you cry?
1555220	1559560	No, not at that. I did cry at a Super Nintendo game though, which one tell me
1559560	1566280	Tell me damn it. Tell me right now. No gonna punch you in your face three Final Fantasy 2. Oh my god
1566280	1570320	Was it because it was so bad? No, because I beat it and the ending was so great
1572120	1578160	Like finally I need a game in my life. We're getting like 12 years old. Okay. I wasn't like falling I was like
1578680	1581400	It wasn't like when I saw dancer in the dark the first time
1581800	1583800	It was just like a little bit
1583800	1589360	I'm so sad it's over. Tear tear. All right. Anyway, sorry
1589800	1595020	Anyways, well if Actraiser isn't your cup of tea, there's gonna be some more stuff coming from Sega
1595400	1599680	Seriously, I want you to unsubscribe from this show. If Actraiser is not your cup of tea
1599680	1605500	You do not deserve to listen. No, I'm kidding. Obviously. There goes all of our listeners. Bye guys. It's nice knowing you
1605840	1609640	Anyways, some new titles from Sega. We're gonna see Sword of a Million
1609640	1613640	Vectorman, Sonic Spinball, and Beyond Oasis
1614440	1617680	so those should be coming within the next couple weeks and
1618440	1621560	There was also some other stuff. I was just reading here last minute from
1622080	1625480	Hudson that was coming out on the virtual console and these are also kind of exciting
1626320	1628600	you're gonna be getting double dungeons and
1629440	1634560	Splatterhouse in March Oh God splatter house do a fancy star for real. Yeah
1635200	1638000	Yeah, I saw a fantasy stars coming out too for a virtual console
1638000	1640280	That's awesome. Where'd you hear that?
1641280	1643280	from the internet
1644000	1646000	Most reliable source ever
1647240	1655200	Yeah, so I know those two looks like they're gonna be both 600 points and according to Hudson's site both do out
1656040	1658040	on March
1658520	1659900	Sonic Spinball
1659900	1664240	Cuz he mentioned it is one of those games like complete opposite end for Mac Tracer. Okay?
1664240	1669000	It's one of those games that like you remember as being really cool like, you know
1669000	1673400	Oh, it's Sonic is a pinball game. And oh, I remember this game was just so awesome
1673400	1676620	And then you play it for five minutes and you go god this shit's boring
1677640	1679160	Isn't it is it just me?
1679160	1684280	No, it's kind of like you like when I go around you and then you start talking to me for about five minutes
1684280	1686280	I'm like, I want to go home
1686880	1692300	Except not really because I love you Rob hearts to you. Let's be the last episode orange launch radio. You ever hear
1692300	1697220	Mm-hmm. Bye speaking of people that shouldn't be talking more than five minutes at a time
1698180	1700180	Perrin Kaplan
1700300	1703620	Opened her mouth about some new things going on the week, by the way
1703620	1709480	I believe Perrin Kaplan also said that the gamecube had been ceased production that there's no more game cubes
1709480	1714420	Right, and then it came out later in the week that oh just kidding. We really haven't stopped making the game cubes
1714420	1717460	I think Perrin Kaplan is kind of like I kind of treat her like
1717460	1724460	Opposite woman like when she says something the opposite is actually true. It's this clever marketing play
1724460	1727980	Yeah, anytime she talks it's like Oh introduction to the opposites
1729980	1731980	Gets that
1732500	1738900	This must be the introduction to the opposite sketch. I totally got it. Okay, but you get it too. Oh wow
1739740	1743540	Just like the other things that she said. Oh the weeds gonna be region-free
1743540	1749020	That was turned out to be true. It's not one of the other gems. Yeah, that was the other gem that she said
1750020	1754580	Some other things she talked about is that there could already be a Wii revision on the Wii
1755100	1757100	DVD playback enabled on it
1758180	1763780	Okay, okay. What do you mean? Oh my god? There's already a how many DVD players do you have in your house?
1764860	1768340	Three or four so do you need another one on the Wii? I don't think so
1768340	1774300	I don't cares. Yeah, I don't bring the pink we out already. I don't think anyone's not buying the Wii because
1775020	1779260	It doesn't have DVD playback. I know that's just a stupid feature anyways
1779260	1783800	I mean, it's kind of thrown in because you know their DVD ROM drives might as well
1783800	1789320	Just put the codex in there. Yeah, that was like popular like five years ago when nobody had a DVD and now it's like hey
1790740	1794820	Exactly so I mean the game cube didn't really play DVDs, so
1794820	1802140	Who gives a shit looking at our chat chat dot orange launch radio comm speedy f40 says the game cube will live on forever
1802620	1806780	Well, yeah, cuz the Wii will play all your GameCube games, so I mean I mean seriously
1806780	1808740	I when I heard that it was going away
1808740	1812180	I was like well that makes sense but the best part about the Wii playing the GameCube games
1812180	1814020	And I always have to explain this to my customers
1814020	1818140	They're running out GameCube games for the Wii and stuff if you don't have GameCube controllers
1818140	1821840	You're fucked you can't play your GameCube games without GameCube controllers
1821840	1827020	Which to be honest is the dumbest thing in the world anyways they should totally support the you know classic controller
1827020	1829020	I third-party controllers
1829020	1833420	Okay, or I'm just saying well. What about you know the classic controller
1833420	1839120	They should you know support that so you don't have to buy yet another fucking controller to plug in to play the GameCube games
1840380	1843700	Let's see act def says who the hell listens to parent Kaplan
1843700	1847540	Okay, look show me five gaming blogs that did not run the story this week
1847540	1853600	Okay, that run stories on Nintendo usually the thing is is that whatever she says makes it on every major gaming blog out there
1853600	1855780	So and for some reason we posted that as well
1856700	1860620	Joe she 16 says she is a classic contrary Mary
1861580	1863580	I've never heard that term Wow
1864180	1867620	contrary Mary contrary contrary Mary I guess
1868460	1871060	Very emphasis on the wrong syllable
1871060	1875500	I said it's a contra no contrary
1876900	1883100	Let's see what else is there uh let's see footy monster. No. I'm sorry who said it was a selling point
1884140	1888960	Damn it somebody in chat room. I'm sorry whoever said it. Oh footy. Oh footy monster did say it doesn't matter sky
1888960	1896480	It's a selling point talking about the DVD playback. Yeah, it's like well. I don't know who cares really well. I don't know what
1897220	1898820	Fix their online
1898820	1902700	That'd be great. Let's fix the online something that we're actually going to use instead of
1903180	1906660	Let's make DVD playback all in time. Yeah, okay
1906660	1909780	We've established that you're the only one that the messages don't download when it's off
1909780	1911140	No, it doesn't work for me either
1911140	1915200	It works for me because I'm the cooler than you because you have that USB you have a dongle
1915540	1918620	You use your dongle and the dongle makes it all work
1920140	1924420	It does quite look like a penis for the computer anyway moving right along anyway
1924420	1930500	So you know if you're looking forward to more independent games on the Wii and they have this big program that they were touting
1930940	1933900	Originally saying that they were going to fund you know a bunch of independent games
1934740	1941100	This whole independent development developer program in which they would give them free development kits and that kind of stuff
1941180	1945240	Well the only problem is they don't have enough development kits to go around apparently
1945240	1948220	They're also in short supply just like the actual Wiis are
1948220	1954260	So a lot of these independent developers aren't going to get to make their crappy ports of games that they probably already released
1954260	1961620	Well the sad part of that is though for those that were wondering where are the downloadable indie games on the virtual console?
1961900	1968080	They haven't even there. They're just a they're a twinkle in mommy's eye right now because there's no dev kits. That's it
1969340	1970420	What?
1970420	1975020	Never mind, but you know to be honest, so there's gonna be some there's just starting
1975020	1981180	You know to get those really crappy games out there. I mean was I was gonna say there's one game coming out in
1981820	1985500	April which I know everybody's gonna run out and pick up chicken shoot
1987500	1992260	On the Wii yes, it's a game where you shoot chickens
1992260	1997020	Do it if it's if it's like duck hunt with chickens sold oh my god chicken
1997020	2001780	She didn't instantly sell that title if they just change it to cock shoot. Hey wait a minute wait a minute
2001780	2006140	Who are you? Oh by the way? This is like you style highlight. You know I'm showing a long time
2007500	2009500	longtime listener
2010900	2016420	Now you've been on the show before but not not in its podcast form so nobody knows who you are in other words, okay?
2016420	2021500	Well, I'm just the nameless voice well really well wait really quickly your three favorite games of all time
2021500	2027020	and why really quickly so we know what type of gamer you are Final Fantasy 6 chrono trigger and

2040940	2043580	No, I'm kidding. You know he's a big fan of Actraiser
2043900	2049020	He played act you just missed the Actraisers come in a virtual console in Japan. I know I got a boat or two
2049580	2056620	Alright, you know so yeah that that's it. No no development kit for me the poor independent folks
2056620	2057980	You know
2057980	2061060	Poor them they can't get free development kids. Oh
2062140	2063420	You cute
2063420	2068100	GS 68 says crack shoot how about instead of chickens you if they bring out chicken shoot
2068100	2071980	I think there should be another mode in it like you remember how a duck hunt had the duck shoot
2071980	2076140	And then they had the sleigh shooting. Yeah, they should have chicken shoot and waffle shoot
2080780	2083380	Speedy f-40 wants to see cock block for the Wii
2083380	2089460	I mean interesting tie isn't that isn't that what was that PSP cock block for the Wii was that PSP game
2089460	2092060	We played at the Konami Brooktown isn't that kind of what?
2093100	2094660	Forget it no
2094660	2099140	That's just one of those games is like I'm so popular in the fictional high school
2099340	2102460	If only it were true in real life stick it in the game
2103740	2109540	Stick it in the game. No stick it in comma the game get it never mind like
2109540	2115660	Bunga that doesn't even make sense you wouldn't even put a comma there, so that's all I know Wario where smooth moves
2116020	2120620	Is there is there a minigame in where we're smooth moves that stick it in no you stick in the game
2120980	2125640	Remember that one where you push down the Super Nintendo game in there man all right moving on anyway um
2126380	2128540	Speaking of the Wii since we have a lot of Wii news tonight
2128540	2131960	This is also noteworthy because weezer still very hard to find yet
2132040	2136340	They have outsold the 360 and the PlayStation 3 in January
2136340	2141820	And this is some preliminary data that made its way onto the internet the Wii sold
2142340	2146420	436 hundred I'm sorry four hundred thirty six thousand units 360
2147140	2149140	294,000 units PlayStation 3
2150260	2157140	244,000 units so it is it's only 50,000 units separating 360 and PlayStation 3 then again 360 has been on the market for a year
2157140	2160820	So it doesn't look too good for Sony Sony might need some games to come out pretty soon
2160820	2166900	To rescue them, but who knows what's gonna happen motor storms coming out in fucking a couple weeks
2166900	2169900	And I cannot wait to play that average racing game
2171140	2176160	But it's still fun. It looks awesome. Well. I'm sure there's some is it on the show world tonight some of the play
2176160	2178300	I don't think we put Q Burt or flow or that stuff
2178300	2181700	So I guess we could take a moment to mention that Q Burt and flow made its way to the yeah
2181700	2185260	I heard Q Burt together. I heard Q Burt sucks and flow is short
2185260	2191420	I heard they redid Q Burt, and I heard it sucks really. I like Q Burt. I want to play it
2191420	2193420	Can I will you download it can I come over and play it? I?
2193860	2197860	Don't know if I want to waste that kind of money. Oh come on. I'll don't you bought a PlayStation
2197860	2200820	Oh, well you didn't buy the PlayStation you bought games for the PlayStation 3
2202340	2205580	You bought Ridge Racer 7 when you already had it when it was called Ridge Racer
2205580	2211380	I know it still sucks, and I bought full auto 2 and it's still full auto 1
2211380	2216660	They just put it in new packaging at a crappy deathmatch mode, and I was a sucker
2217100	2219500	And I bought that crap so you can say yeah
2219500	2221100	You're getting some compliments tonight
2221100	2226780	Seisha says Loki is great this evening and a footy monster says Loki is picking up the slack for dark soccer tonight
2226780	2228780	He's like double pissed off
2228980	2233660	It's just I mean I hate these games that they put out at launch and they call this sequel
2233660	2234940	And it's really not a sequel
2234940	2241180	It's just like fucking it's like a perfect example is for the Wii coming out next month Prince of Persia rival sword
2241180	2248460	It's fucking two thrones all over again. All you do is tack on some stupid controls to it and added chariot racing
2250020	2256220	Chariot race that was the only thing that was missing from the first one. Oh god. I really wish there was chariot racing in this
2257740	2259740	They got my letters yes
2260660	2265100	Ravens dolphin in the chat room says a flow is a beautiful screensaver. Yes
2265100	2272460	I hear it's a screen saver the reviews. I've heard like it's after dark at the game listen. Okay listen Sony
2273180	2280660	Stop making games that utilize this stupid tilt functionality crap because to be honest. They're not that great
2280660	2286420	I mean flow okay. That's kind of cool. You know because it was a cool web game when it was free and stuff
2287460	2294220	But this like super rubber dub or whatever it's coming out with the Ducks. It's the same damn game again
2294220	2296220	It's just like that other
2297060	2302180	Game that was out there right now. That's kind of a clone of geometry wars that one sucks to
2302660	2305580	Stop releasing games. It's just a stupid gimmick
2306780	2309220	Jeremy Todd one in chat have some advice for Sony
2309220	2314420	This is sure to make the Sony fanboys very pleased Jeremy Todd one says I got an idea for what Sony should do I think
2314420	2319460	Sony should go ride the roller coaster at death right into the lake of fire doom and torture where its eyes will get ripped and
2319460	2324260	Then they're forced to eat the eyes with a broken fork where they will continually watch bad TV shows over and over
2325100	2330420	You can address those cards and letters to Jeremy Todd one care of orange lounge anyways so more happy stuff though
2331220	2335220	Elite beat agents is getting a sequel which isn't too surprising because the game is pretty awesome
2336140	2341060	So definitely actually it is surprising is the game didn't sell as well as they thought it would especially not in Japan
2341060	2345980	Yeah, but it's Nintendo. They're not gonna come up with anything original gaming come on. He's so are you smoking crack?
2346140	2348340	What is the we what is the we?
2348340	2351980	Oh, okay, I'm not gonna come up with something original, okay?
2351980	2359300	Let me see here um another Super Mario sequel another Metroid sequel another Donkey Kong sequel whoo. That's brand new shit
2359300	2361380	I think we got a wee leadest here
2362900	2370580	Anyways, so a leap e agents with yet more you know some different music because this is what this is the natural progression of your
2370580	2373460	You know music games is let's get some different music
2373460	2381020	Um they're not really specifying a release date yet, but they're seeing that the new game is gonna have four player action and
2381980	2383980	It's gonna have a new snappy title
2385980	2387220	All right
2387220	2391980	So I I cannot wait for this game, but they're saying that the Japanese version is getting a sequel
2391980	2393980	We don't know about American yet, right?
2394220	2398500	No word on the u.s.. Yeah, but you know if it's coming on Japan. They're gonna translate it so
2398500	2403860	Well, I mean they didn't really translate oh and on they kind of gave us a whole new version
2403860	2409020	That was I think better, but you know depends. What kind of music you're into anyway Eddie is dying over here
2409020	2411580	He wants to share some wee news that wasn't on our show roll
2412700	2415660	Yeah, there's there's an unconfirmed rumor on the internet
2415660	2422860	Which is always reliable that Nintendo is gonna come out with sensor ankle straps so like you can kick and dance and kick
2423860	2425780	That's that's a bunch of bullshit
2425780	2430220	I think that'd be odd like it even if it's not sure like if it was true. That'd be awesome. That'd be so cool
2431380	2433380	Can anybody say Sega activator?
2434580	2437060	Sega activator that's pretty easy I
2437980	2443900	Think that'd be cool. I don't know like you could like run and jump and do it and do it
2445860	2448100	SSJ 100 man chat says that's fake
2448100	2453340	Oh shot down ouch
2456500	2458500	Sweet
2458740	2460740	Dead air I
2461900	2468780	Just wanted to point out though a Loki the Nintendo fanboy train is going by and you know you're not on it oh
2468780	2484380	Oh sick burn Rob. Come on Loki get on the wee fanboy train. That's why we don't give him like a fucking soundboard because we'd have stuff like this.
2485660	2490740	No, yes, because no Loki actually is a Nintendo. He likes Nintendo. I went over to his video game party
2490740	2494700	It was like all Nintendo pretty much. I mean so he's not against Nintendo come on now
2494700	2500380	I'm picking up and you know SSX blur next week, and that's gonna be awesome. I'm really looking forward to that
2500980	2502980	But to be honest you know
2503380	2505500	There's a lot of games that are coming out
2505940	2509420	And mostly by Ubisoft so fuck you Ubisoft because I hate you
2509980	2513460	That are just fucking ports of shit. I mean
2514260	2520620	Stop releasing like old-ass games under a new title because they're on the portable systems now and on the Wii
2520620	2524980	You know it's just a port of some old game that was out before listen
2524980	2529260	It didn't sell well the first time stop trying to port it over to get some more sales out of it
2529420	2533780	Especially do we do we really need another port of driver parallel lines?
2533780	2539900	I mean wasn't it bad enough the first time and now you have to enhance it with some better control
2539900	2545260	What about the dude that was with what IGN or something that got quoted in some blogs as we saying guys?
2545260	2551580	Oh my god something really cool. He needs a diet of fire. Okay. That's stupid Matt Casamani or whatever
2551740	2555860	I've got secret news. I can't tell you about it, but it's so over cool
2555900	2559620	You're just gonna be so amazed when you hear about it, okay?
2559620	2564460	Well that could be anything that could be anything and the fact that you come out and say I got a secret
2564460	2568980	I'm not telling you though. I got a secret. You're gonna. Love it. It's so cool
2568980	2575500	Mm-hmm uh-huh why the fuck okay? Why the fuck is he posting that in his blog in the earth?
2575500	2580820	You know the other thing is why the fuck are people posting it in their blogs like say dude
2580820	2585660	Did you hear the guy from IGN he heard that there's news coming? That's cool
2586460	2589180	And did you fuck is that oh my god?
2589180	2592980	You guys Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is coming to partner net but you didn't hear it from me
2592980	2595100	That's that missed our show world to you know
2595100	2601300	I'll think yeah that even though we're not supposed to talk about it. Do Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is totally a partner net Rob
2601300	2605700	What is this like the same guy that was the t-shirt dude from two weeks ago?
2605700	2610940	I like your t-shirt thing maybe wow that's pretty crazy because you do the voice exactly the same
2610940	2616820	That's my that's my uniform straight male voice actually oh wow you do really well. Thank you. You're welcome. You know rice princess
2616820	2621980	I'm just give me a beer and maybe a pie bitch. You know I'm gonna say you know other stuff a lot of stuff
2621980	2625180	That's on partner net that people go and report about it's not really
2626220	2632220	Surprises, it's like stuff. That's been in development stuff that a lot of people already knew about so and the fact
2632220	2636260	I don't I don't know if you guys read the fine print on your NDA's
2636260	2643500	But uh you're not supposed to talk about partner net and I hope that God that whoever keeps leaking this shit because it's not
2643500	2651040	Really, even a story. It's just like guess what I saw that that jetpack game that they've already announced is on partner net
2651040	2658360	Wow, you didn't announce the game. You didn't give me any details about the game all you said that is you're confirming something that they've already announced
2659360	2666720	Wow, that's awesome. Guess what Wario aware smooth moves. It's in stores now. I just confirm something that they've already announced
2668240	2670240	Give me my own blog
2670720	2674240	Joshi 16 says attention Loki. It's all about attention
2675280	2679920	Let's see what else is there here and Nintendo maniac 64 says breaking news
2679920	2681920	There's news coming
2683040	2685760	GS68 says Loki a free speech anyone
2687040	2689240	Fine, but I don't have to listen to them
2690000	2692000	All right. Well anyhow
2692720	2694680	We should move on to another story here
2694680	2700600	And this is like this ongoing saga like I thought we would have talked about this once on the show
2700960	2703160	laughed and it would be done with and I'm talking about
2703800	2707040	Level 30 and you know when I say level 30, I'm talking about
2707040	2708800	Yes
2708800	2714120	It's like do you want to know how far down the rabbit hole goes? Well, it's actually level 30 and that's about it
2714120	2717140	Well, here's the thoughts there. What's very interesting?
2717140	2723280	Is that not only when you get your replacement bubble bobble revolution that will let you go all the way to level 31
2723720	2726480	You get a free copy of Rainbow Islands
2727040	2731760	Revolution because I didn't even know there was a Rainbow Islands revolution
2731760	2737600	I did and I actually played the old-school Rainbow Islands. I still play it today on game tap
2737600	2742640	And I could care less that there's this DF version out and if I'm a Rainbow Islands fanboy
2742640	2746960	And don't give a shit about this DS release. I can't imagine there's five people who bought this game
2747440	2752400	Therefore you're getting this free game because nobody else wanted it. They have extra copies sitting in a warehouse
2752400	2758720	So does this atone for their sins is all well with Codemasters now because they gave you a free game
2758720	2762360	I mean you gotta say they didn't have to do that. Let me just put it this way they should really fire
2762360	2765720	They're marketing people because that cover for bubble bobble
2766280	2769880	Revolution or whatever looks like crap. I mean those dinosaurs look
2770480	2775360	They gain like a thousand pounds or something like Jenny Craig anyone
2775520	2777720	There's a nice little letter that came with it
2777880	2782660	Please find and closed a replacement for your defective bubble bobble Nintendo DS cartridge
2782660	2785720	You should find that you encounter no problems when playing this new version
2785720	2791400	We would like to apologize for the problems you've had with this game and hope that the need to swap the cartridges did not
2791600	2795880	Inconvenience you too much. We have enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island
2796700	2800640	Also for the Nintendo TS, so there's only one so oh great. Oh great
2800640	2807360	So I got you know I my bubble bobble wouldn't go to level 30, and now there's only one goddamn island in Rainbow Islands
2807360	2815160	Hahaha, okay wait. You know we've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island. You know why they included Rainbow Islands, right?
2815800	2818400	Because bubble bubble really only goes up to 31
2819040	2821560	So they're like oh you're gonna be done after 31
2822280	2825680	Yeah, because I work for them anyway
2825680	2828960	I know this we've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island as
2829320	2832960	Consideration for the length of time that you had to wait for the new cartridges to be manufactured
2832960	2838680	Please dispose of your faulty cartridge by simply putting it in the trash or local
2839040	2843000	Recycling facility where one exists you know why it's called Rainbow Island
2843320	2846760	Because they didn't finish the rest of the levels and you're gonna have to send it in
2846760	2850020	No, you know what you need to fucking do with that replacement cartridge
2850680	2852680	Return it to your local GameStop
2852880	2857440	And get some money back because they're not gonna know the difference they got it come on
2857600	2861760	They're not dumb enough to buy it. Yeah, they are way. They can tell no they're not
2861760	2866820	Okay, fine. Take it back to your local whatever used game store all right well
2866820	2871680	Uh stories about bubble bubble revolution going on four weeks in a row make me very angsty
2871680	2875640	And I don't know about you, but that makes me want to bring on the pain with the FUs of the week
2875640	2896560	A dark soccer is not here tonight. I will put in a preemptive dark soccer FU to traffic and people with how she's busy with massage school and all that crap all right Loki what's your FU tonight?
2896560	2899640	I don't really have an FU, but I'm gonna take this moment to
2900360	2902920	Let everyone in on a huge secret
2902920	2908040	There is some uber huge exciting news
2909520	2916360	Coming soon, and I tell you once you hear what this news is it's gonna fucking blow your mind
2917080	2921060	It's so amazing. I really wish I could tell you, but I can't
2921720	2923720	You know NDA's and all
2924880	2929980	I like how they follow the NDA's when it comes to that news, but when it comes to everything else it is kind of wet NDA
2929980	2932940	You know why cuz there's no news
2934300	2940060	This is the same guy said there's fucking halo on the Gameboy Advance. I mean come on. Oh my god. There is oh
2940980	2943240	My god burn your Gameboy eyes princess
2946300	2948300	Unsubscribe all right uh I
2948860	2955820	Would like to give an FU to whoppers the original malted milk balls because they are so addicting and I think bro
2955820	2960780	I remain in a bunch of them when I wasn't here so FU to that don't steal my whoppers when I'm not here
2961260	2963260	Give me my malted milk balls
2963700	2965700	How dare it bitch?
2965900	2968500	How dare you take my malted milk balls Eddie?
2969380	2974580	I'd like to say an FU to all the garbage that I've been keeping in my closet because I'm moving and I have to throw
2974580	2978840	It away now, and I'm like ah it's taking forever, and it's horribly bad
2979740	2981740	FU garbage in my closet

2989100	2992060	FU to the auction house on Elder Thallus because
2992660	2999180	You're stupid, and you'd never have good leather head here that I need for my Twink
3000380	3002380	Yeah, let's do few more poo-poo
3003380	3005380	Yeah, what the hell does that even mean?
3005940	3008700	Let's do more poo-poo. What does that even mean?
3008700	3012860	It's supposed to be like get off the game and go shut up for a second. I'm kidding
3013060	3015280	It's supposed to be less pew pew more pew pew
3016060	3020000	But I call it less pew pew more poo poo because it's funner to say
3020780	3024940	What does even pew pew mean like shooting like pew pew?
3025180	3029620	But what if you're a warrior you don't really shoot then punch yourself in the face. Why the fuck are you playing a warrior?
3030340	3032340	Warriors in lane
3032540	3034700	Playing a rogue or a hunter anything else
3034700	3041460	And that's it like you style. Do you have anything you wish to I contribute a few the Taco Bell because it makes more poo-poo
3042620	3044620	Yeah, more poo-poo less pew pew
3045140	3047140	in that case
3047980	3049980	You know you
3052460	3054300	Speaking of
3054300	3061040	Things that are pretty poo-poo in my opinion alien Hamed is coming to Xbox 360. Sorry. I did not like alien Hamed
3061040	3065020	I are hominid or whatever the hell it is. What's alien Hamed alien Hamed? It was a game
3065020	3070460	That was out on the PlayStation 2 no. I know what alien hominid is it's a flash game. It's not that great
3070460	3073900	I don't know why people are like so freakin excited and ecstatic
3073900	3077740	I mean I suppose yay indie development and all that stuff, but I'm not gonna buy it
3078380	3083980	But whatever alien hominid HD is confirmed to be the game coming to Xbox Live Arcade this Wednesday
3084540	3090380	Because Xbox live talked to one up and somebody spilled the guts because everybody always talks to one up because I don't know I think
3090380	3095020	They pay people to talk probably yeah, so they get that
3095540	3101700	So there you go and also hopefully boom boom rocket and wing commander are in the near future
3101700	3106300	Oh boy. I'm sure we have a story on that later. Don't we Loki?
3106900	3114860	Yes, wing commanders coming to Xbox live arcade wing commander arena and nobody cares because it looks like shit
3115500	3117860	I don't know if anyone's seen the videos out there
3117860	3122780	But the wing commander that you've known and loved or maybe didn't like
3123500	3127980	This is certainly not the same game in fact. This is as much wing commander as
3128500	3130900	Nova drone was Twisted Metal, so I
3131780	3138820	Don't know, but anyways if you're interested. It's 16 players online and you can battle each other might be cool
3139780	3141300	No, well come on
3141300	3146380	I mean even though the game did not look like wing commander like if you've seen the little game preview somebody took the wing commander
3146380	3152500	License and put it on some like random space shooter game, but 16 people come on. That's got to be fun
3152500	3158280	What's novadrome fun with 16 people novadrome? No, you're right novadrome was just like a fun game at all anyway
3158280	3162180	So it is coming out. It's going to have you know up to 16 players
3162180	3165180	They're going to have free-for-all maps dueling maps team maps
3165740	3167660	blah blah blah
3167660	3169340	and
3169340	3171140	Yeah, it's great
3171140	3173140	There's videos online YouTube
3173140	3176860	I'm game trailers comms check it out and be disappointed
3178220	3184340	Apparently boom boom rocket is really anticipated by a lot of folks in chat room that looks fun. It doesn't fun
3184340	3189420	I love see I like DDR, and I did like fan of vision so our old buddy
3189420	3194140	Mel B's in chat and says it's like dance mania speed meets fireworks. That's a boom boom rocket is
3194980	3196980	Well, that's all I want to say I want to see a
3197700	3201060	Video of that emotion we see screenshots, but screenshots only tell you so much
3201060	3207180	You know that would be kind of fun to play Def Jam icon of dance mania speed as the custom soundtrack in that
3208260	3212380	Any game with a dance mania speed is the custom soundtrack is sure to be hilarity
3214020	3219460	Something that's not funny is my Xbox 360 it makes too damn much noise whenever I'm playing it and
3219740	3222900	apparently though there is a rumor going around because you know when when
3223660	3227700	Websites that are foreign release news. It's just the case this German website
3227700	3232900	It's only a rumor the the u.s.. Websites won't believe it until Microsoft
3232900	3238740	I can't read it well, whatever, but anyway um it certainly sounds like it could be a possibility a German gaming website
3239140	3243100	When it was it called things in a might not dear Sinemite
3243100	3245380	I don't know they they announced that
3246020	3252740	Microsoft has done a software update for debug Xbox 360s that reduces the speed of the DVD drive
3252740	3259820	Causing the noise to go down, but the drive is slower than yeah, but did it need all the high speeds
3259820	3261320	I mean, I would ask well
3261320	3266400	Don't you think the update is smart enough to know hey when you need the high speed use high speed when you don't need it
3266500	3270940	Shut up. They don't really care. How loud the DVD drive is cuz me be honest
3270940	3275120	I don't really notice mine when I'm playing games, and if you're gonna be wrong sitting there going damn
3275120	3278500	My drive is loud, then you're gonna die. I'm gonna be honest
3278500	3282460	I do notice it especially when you boot the system like when you boot and you're starting a game
3282460	3287940	That's when I really noticed that I'm like goddamn is my Xbox 360 gonna launch into space cuz it makes so much noise
3289820	3291820	It's gonna just blast off through the roof
3292700	3295540	Don't you think they make up? Maybe it's just cuz mines vertical standing
3295540	3299900	I don't know I think because yours on is on a hard surface and so it transfers the sound
3300180	3304100	But I mean if you put it on carpet like I have mine right now
3304100	3308260	I was playing on my monitor on my computer and so I have it sitting on next to my
3308260	3312100	You know normal PC, and I don't really hear it. I mean I
3312500	3316780	Don't know, but then again. I have headphones on and I'm listening to the music and stuff so
3317380	3319100	but
3319100	3322300	Whatever. I don't know. It's not a big deal for me. I mean if it was like
3323260	3326340	Like the whole time when you're playing it then that'd be a little different, but
3327300	3330580	It would just be really weird if it was that. Unsubscribe clicks you were getting.
3331180	3336620	Throughout the world. So it's not a huge deal though. It's not like like a chainsaw sound or something like that
3336620	3340220	I don't know it people just need to quit bitching
3340900	3346580	Speedy F40 ouch ears GS 68 Loki WTF alpha canagram damn Loki
3348300	3350500	It's better etc. Loki needs a sedative
3350500	3355900	I was gonna say Eddie was making fun of me calling my wireless headset a wireless communicator at one point
3355900	3360740	But I wanted to say during my gaming week. I bought one of those $20 things you can put in your computer
3360740	3364420	What's about the gaming receiver or something like that so you can use your wireless headset?
3364420	3370860	It's awesome because I can use my wireless headset on ventrilo and it what I didn't have to do any configuration my computer
3371140	3376180	Ventrilo just automatically new and like the voices come through on the ear and you can talk with the heads
3376180	3378940	It's great. It's just buy a bunch of this and I'll do the show
3379980	3383200	It's too bad Rob cuz the ventrilo server doesn't work anymore
3383260	3390420	So you've never gone and Rob puts on a red mini Ohura skirt and goes all hailing frequencies open captain for lovin
3390420	3396020	You know even understands that nobody from Star Trek thousands of listeners of orange
3396020	3401300	I'm sorry hundreds of listeners after tonight of action. Actually, maybe 20 listeners more time after tonight and
3402260	3404260	Not a one of them is gonna understand that
3405580	3407580	All right
3407620	3414780	Anywho, well one thing that's never quieting down is these stupid rumors about mill yourself for on the 360 and
3414780	3421420	And yet another one kind of flaming or fanning the flames of this rumor. There's apparently a
3422300	3429100	kind of a survey going around asking people of their interests and mill yourself for on the Xbox 360 and
3429460	3433380	Questions like would you like to see mill yourself for on the Xbox 360?
3433380	3436500	Would you buy an Xbox 360 just to play mill yourself for?
3437060	3444220	On a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 being not at all satisfied and 100 being very satisfied
3444220	3448540	How would you rate Konami's output on Xbox 360 to date?
3448540	3455180	Well, that would be a big fat crap because and also on this survey. Do you like candy?
3455580	3462780	Do you like money because it's Captain Obvious's survey, of course people want to see Metal Gear Solid on 360, right?
3462780	3466320	I mean more games the better like you saw you're shaking your head. Why not?
3467980	3470500	Because I hate the Xbox 360
3470500	3474020	Basically, thank you. Why do you hate the 360? I don't hate it
3474020	3480620	I don't hate it, but it's not as good as is like a DS or we sign reasons titles
3481100	3483100	That's what matters. Yeah
3483300	3488220	360 he's got a lot of shit coming out. I mean, I don't know a lot of it's good, you know
3488620	3490620	exclusive titles boom boom rocket
3491060	3494220	Well, I'm like boom boom fire booboo dollar
3494220	3501420	No, I'm gonna get one only for the mist Walker titles cuz I'm a big og Final Fantasy fanboy dragon
3501420	3505500	Yes, blue fucking dragon dragon looks awesome. And so does lost Odyssey. So
3507540	3513940	Lost Odyssey's a ways off. It's not hopefully it won't be a lost cause
3516140	3520860	No, but anyways this comes from apparently an evil avatar forum post so
3520860	3526740	I take that as rumor, I guess to be honest. I don't believe that this such survey exists, but you know
3527180	3532100	Evil avatars another all-game show so we got a I'm just saying but this is like a listener
3532100	3535060	This isn't exactly you know, but whatever I mean
3536060	3542460	It's possible that they're do they really need to ask people what their interest is in mill yourself for I mean, that's like
3542460	3545380	Yeah, I'm like, would you like to see halo 3? I
3546420	3548060	mean
3548060	3549900	It's dumb
3549900	3554100	Shadows lair says my god a survey amazing. It's confirmed. I
3554860	3558460	Think it was a little bit of sarcasm sarcasm there speaking of obvious
3558820	3564580	It sounds like crackdown 2 is already being greenlit and that gets a big fat duh as well
3565100	3566260	I
3566260	3571620	Mean, maybe maybe it'll contain the halo 4 beta in the that was the joke that yeah, I read that
3571620	3574820	Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah, I stole a joke from whatever the site of QJ or whatever
3574820	3577620	But I mean come on didn't take a lot of brains come up with that joke
3577620	3580740	Cuz isn't that the only reason why crackdowns really selling a halo 3 beta?
3580740	3584220	I think a lot of people are actually buying for the game because it's a fun game
3585140	3586500	It's a lot of fun
3586500	3591320	And I mean if it were just for the halo 3 beta then you wouldn't see a lot of people
3591320	3596200	you know playing the game right now because a halo 3 beta isn't out this by the way comes from a
3597420	3603880	Interviewer with senior designer Steven in Netta when he gave a review to computer video games simply this magazine
3603880	3611120	He mentioned you know was what he would put in a crackdown to which you know obviously a more believable
3611560	3614240	Functioning city the city makes the fun
3614240	3619660	I think it comes to how you can choose how you choose and approach your missions and so on and so on well the thing
3619660	3624020	Is about crackdown and the even and we're talking about when they were designing the game originally
3624020	3630560	They've made it to where they can add islands and add whole extra parts of the city that aren't in the full game right now
3630560	3637040	Later on so this game can expand almost as much as like oblivion can so
3637880	3639680	You know I hope they go that route
3639680	3646320	That'd be really cool chat room is shooting down the whole halo Chi stand corrected apparently a ddr dollar bill says I like to crack
3646320	3651880	down fuck halo 3 beta Jeremy Todd once is I could care less about the halo 3 beta crackdown as amazing as a game and
3652520	3657520	Ddr dollar bill confirms again crackdown is more fun than fucking halo. I mean don't get me wrong
3657520	3663240	I'm gonna play the halo 3 beta because I'm gonna you know be able to play the halo 3 beta, but I
3664040	3669120	Don't know. I'm not too excited about it. I think it's just gonna be everyone's gonna be I think disappointed because
3670560	3673360	There's been a lot of people who have done it really good so far
3673360	3679960	And there's not really much you can innovate on and this you know big secret X button crap or whatever that is
3679960	3685180	I don't think it's gonna be that big deal, so whatever we shall see anyways
3685180	3691780	So another thing that's gonna be shown pretty soon is gonna be Xbox 360s IP TV
3692380	3696860	service, and they're actually showing it at the connected home show at
3698140	3700320	Well in Europe of course some brand new
3701180	3703180	show down there and
3703340	3705420	Looks interesting not really too much
3705980	3711640	You know they don't really go into any details on it, but I guess it's gonna have you know DVR stuff in there as well
3711640	3717680	Anything that gave me more TV channels. I'm all for so you know I can't wait to check this out
3719320	3721880	Hopefully you know they start you know having some
3722560	3727540	You know I want a DVR anyways because I don't have that currently with my cable subscriber, but
3729040	3732080	Hopefully, it's not all like MSNBC or something like that
3734440	3738200	I'm curious about it. I don't like the fact that you have to switch everything to do it
3738200	3743520	I'm not gonna switch everything just to have TV on my 360. Yeah, I mean apparently it's gonna be taking place
3743520	3748600	So um the connected home show and that's March 5th through 7th in Olympia, London
3749240	3752080	I'd like to see some youtubage of it in motion I
3753360	3759360	Don't know anyhow something else very cool announced to the Xbox 360 price cuts for the games yay
3759760	3761040	Actually not all the games
3761040	3762480	It's the platinum hit series
3762480	3767560	But you know we all like news on a price cut and actually a lot of those are already price cut so I've already been
3767560	3773340	Price cut yeah, they just saw the new packaging well supposedly March 16th is the day that the new packaging will come out
3773340	3775340	But it sounds like a lot of retailers have been proactive
3775760	3779200	Whatever you drop the price well for the low low price of 30 bucks
3779200	3785120	You can get battlefield to burn out revenge Call of Duty 2 dead or alive 4 fight night round 3
3785240	3790620	Ghost Recon advanced warfighter topspin 2 or Rockstar Games table tennis
3790620	3795160	Which I seem to recall only cost 39 in the first place yeah, so it's not much of a price cut
3795160	3797860	But um and topspin 2 sucks balls don't buy it
3798680	3804040	But some of those other ones that a lot of very popular such as Ghost Recon is pretty popular Call of Duty 2 about
3804840	3810160	Battlefield and so on I'm pretty sure folks will be all over that all you need to know that just means that those used games
3810160	3815580	Are going to drop down even more so just buy the used games especially if they're that old. There's no point
3816280	3820800	Japan's getting some extra games in there well actually they only get battlefield
3820800	3828280	But burnout but chrome hounds as well and perfect dark zero and other regions in Asia also get 99 nights
3828560	3830680	Which should be interesting chrome hounds?
3830680	3835640	I do believe is already dropped down in price in the United States as well, so I mean
3836160	3841520	You can probably find that if you really keep in mind if you want to have the best tanks in the game or whatever the
3841520	3844400	Best mechs whatever you call them you have to buy extra stuff online
3844480	3849480	Just wait for armored core 4 because this is the game that you should have bought in the first place anyways
3849480	3855000	And you know I was a sucker also bought chrome hounds thinking. Oh, it's gonna be just like armored core
3855000	3858960	It's like armored core with like anchors being dragged behind you. It's so
3860200	3862200	slow and
3862320	3865320	Boring armor core for it's the way to go um anyways
3866080	3869240	There's another rumor that's been confirmed this week
3869680	3872960	Mercenaries 2 is coming to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360
3873280	3877880	Despite the fact that this is kind of news that everybody already knew about since you know
3877880	3883960	There was like you know some shots that they were talking about the game and stuff, and there was 360 dev kids behind them
3883960	3885320	I mean
3885320	3889600	It's like a big duh so that game is gonna be coming out mercenaries if you don't remember
3889760	3895960	Originally believe was put out by Lucasarts, and it was one of those games that you can I remember the commercial actually for it
3895960	3900520	They're all you know you know shoot people blow stuff up blow stuff up again
3900520	3906120	You know it's it's kind of one of those sandbox type of games where you can just cause a lot of mayhem
3906120	3910280	Cause a lot of mayhem, so I will definitely be checking it out
3912520	3919040	And except for fall by the way a game that I will definitely check out is Elder Scrolls 5 because you know
3919040	3921040	there's gonna be one on the way and
3921760	3924800	Elder Scrolls 4 was obviously an amazing game on
3925640	3929960	Bethesda has confirmed Elder Scroll 5 will happen. It's definitely going to happen
3929960	3935480	There's no immediate plans right now according to the studio's vice president of PR marketing Pete Hines
3935480	3941520	but what else is interesting is that he says the possibility of an MMO is kind of a
3942480	3944480	natural step for the series
3945760	3947240	very interesting
3947240	3948760	But what's interesting about that?
3948760	3955800	It's been bounced around according to Heinz, but they will not move forward with it unless there's a fresh idea for the MMO genre
3955800	3960760	But dude, I think opening up oblivion as an MMO would you know or that type of game is an MMO
3960760	3961400	It's good enough
3961400	3966240	Don't you think I mean God on that multiplayer patch hit most people were like this should have just been in the game to begin
3966240	3969920	With it's gonna be crazy though. It'd be interesting. I
3970800	3975760	Don't know. I can't wait. I but you know you're not gonna see this game until like
3976240	3981120	2009 at their earliest I mean it's going to be at the it's gonna be when people are talking about
3981680	3987920	PlayStation 4 and Xbox 720 whenever that you know happens or the fuck else they're gonna call it. Yeah, we'll see
3988820	3990040	anyways
3990040	3996600	So with clover being dissolved some of the members of course went on to create the brand new company seed
3996720	4002280	The other members stick are stuck around and are now working for Capcom. Well. What are they working on?
4002720	4006440	you can be seeing them working on Resident Evil 5 for one and
4007000	4009440	Of course a brand new Wii game as well
4009680	4012920	So it's kind of nice to see you know clover because I know they were
4013160	4019760	Doing a lot of original IPs and stuff and kind of you know throwing that kind of creative side to Resident Evil
4019760	4021320	5 and
4021320	4024120	Hopefully this Wii game. That's pretty awesome, so
4025680	4027600	Pretty sweet, huh?
4027600	4032520	Interesting I so I guess clover not as far gone as you know some people think well
4032520	4034680	They're gone, but it's just they've kind of you know
4035320	4039240	It's it's like you know if you buy a company or something like that a lot of times
4039240	4044400	You'll dissolve the company and just say okay, whoever wants to move over. We'll pay you to move over otherwise
4044400	4049280	Find a new job. You know it's kind of like that all right pretty much keep the same people, but
4050000	4052680	Yeah, you know the talent, but you don't have to carry
4052680	4058240	You don't have to pay for the you know the spot you know the lease or whatever you're just cutting costs that way so well
4058240	4062380	That was the last story we had paid for part a but we're actually running a little early tonight
4062380	4065160	So um I think we'll actually go to the skype line and take some calls
4065160	4068280	I covertly open up the skype line there and saw if we get any calls
4068600	4071600	So we'll get some calls out of the way early a little bit tonight because we're running early tonight

4099800	4104300	Congratulations. Yeah, was it hot was this was it as good for you as it was for me
4104300	4107540	I I'm sure it was probably better for you because I tried harder
4107540	4113640	But I mean I'm sure it worked out for everybody all right speedy. What kind of games you into well right now. I'm playing
4114480	4119620	Rebels Alliance, I don't know Star Wars deadly Alliance or something for the PSP because I got it through gamefly
4119620	4123400	And it's mildly entertaining, but uh I plan some wow
4123400	4131280	And some Wii games even though I got a topic for you. All right. What's up? I think the Wii is overrated oh
4132000	4138240	Gasp you're on Loki's side tonight you so you are not on the train tonight with everybody else
4138240	4141120	You're you're not on the Wii fanboy train. Yeah
4144480	4145840	God
4145840	4151400	Just kidding. Yeah, I'm not on the fanboy train. I think that the Wii is completely overrated because
4151400	4156300	Okay, I think it's just about a more of a party system a fad system if you will I have a Wii
4156300	4162700	I bought it the day it came out, and I'm missing I'm missing my gaming experience. I've been going to the PC more and more often
4164060	4169820	But you know what's interesting do you think the Wii is going the way of the GameCube because I even I love Nintendo
4169820	4174020	I would have paid the GameCube very similarly although you had some phenomenal games on GameCube
4174020	4180180	You know Resident Evil 4 it was mostly a party system your Mario parties your Smash Brothers melees. You know it's a party system
4180180	4185340	I don't think it'll go the way of the GameCube because it has that quirkiness, and it has games like oh gosh
4186740	4190960	Wari aware which is a really fun game definitely kudos to them from doing that one
4191220	4195980	But I think that a serious gamer would be better off with the Xbox 360
4196660	4199220	So you don't think you know the uber-cool
4199660	4204620	Metroid or or no no the uber-cool super secret thing the IGN guy won't shut up about you
4204620	4206380	Don't think that's gonna change your mind
4206380	4210460	No, I don't think a DVD drive or anything like that's gonna change my mind at all
4211060	4213980	See I totally disagree because on the Twilight Princess
4213980	4215980	I think that was a perfect marriage of
4216060	4220900	Classic sort of old-school styling with combining some of the Wii elements to make it more immersive
4220900	4223860	Oh, give me a break Twilight Princess sucked
4223860	4229260	It was not as good as it could have been that was developed for the GameCube, and it showed definitely show
4229260	4234840	Yeah, but I think it's just I think it showed that the that the it can do a classic style game and still be awesome
4234840	4238160	It could do a classic style game when it's a freaking port
4238160	4242420	I think that the Twilight Princess was entertaining because it was Zelda
4242420	4248600	But I don't think it was any better than any other platformer could have been there was no huge breakthrough
4249120	4256800	You know our chat room very polarized on the same topic JB Mon says Twilight Princess was overrated shadow next gen says I love Twilight Princess
4258040	4263760	JB Mon also says Twilight Princess showed fanboys will love anything. You know what I like Wind Waker a lot better
4263760	4268920	I'd be honest what you're smoking crack. I liked Wind Waker. I thought we'd make a Nintendo
4268920	4272640	I am on the Nintendo train, and I didn't even like Wind Waker. I liked Wind Waker
4272640	4274680	I thought it was a fun game the only good
4274680	4281200	I was disappointed about Wind Waker is once you know and this is a spoiler once you go under the you know the ocean you
4281200	4284080	See oh, it's Hyrule. You know I was like well
4284080	4287200	Why the fuck did they just not make it like a remake of you know?
4287560	4291160	You know link to the past or something like that with that kind of style
4291160	4295120	I mean from the person who was criticizing Nintendo early in the show for doing too damn many remakes ah
4296440	4299040	Okay, honed no. Here's what I'm saying though
4299040	4301180	I don't necessarily want to do an actual remake
4301180	4305600	But I just wanted to actually be in Hyrule instead of in the ocean
4305600	4309660	I mean because I would have rather had you know more land and stuff like that and run around like that
4309660	4312800	I don't mind the art, so I thought it was kind of different
4312800	4318160	You know you got used to it, and it kind of worked. It's just and then now I'm playing you know
4318160	4323480	Twilight Princess, and I lost interest in like an hour, so
4324280	4328400	Same here loki same here. I don't get it. I don't get why everyone is a 10
4329040	4333900	Did you play through the whole game though Twilight Princess? Yeah? No? I look like yeah?
4333900	4337120	No, I'm sucks that you're gonna play through it. No yeah, no the first
4337120	4340280	I mean the story doesn't really start developing right away, though
4340280	4343240	I mean once you get into it. I mean it's like it's the first it to me
4343240	4347320	It's the only true sequel to ocarina of time. I mean once you get into it like it's it's really cool
4347320	4351840	They start touching base with all the old ocarina of time. I didn't even care about ocarina of time though. See that's it
4351840	4355720	Oh, wow, so you're not even a Zelda fan then all right well the beautiful part of orange lounge radio

4459880	4461960	Yeah, no, but you know, it's a third party
4461960	4465740	I'll agree the third party games on the Wii do kind of sucks by the time. It'll be good. Yeah

4520440	4525000	Hi, this is Alex kid from a former Sega fame. How you doing? Hi Alex kid
4525520	4532120	Wow, I'm really sorry to hear about your career. Whatever happened to you. Oh, well, I retired in 1990 and rather I didn't retire
4532120	4539160	I got fired by Sega. They wanted to bring in that stupid fucking rodent sonic. Uh-huh. Think you're all familiar with him. Yeah, are you better?
4539160	4545760	At all about that. No, cuz see here's what I think. I think he's only had one good game in the past five years
4545760	4547160	I think
4547160	4552040	It's high time that Sega brings me back. Do you think so bring it back all the classic stuff with Nintendo?
4552040	4554240	Why don't they bring me back? Have you written Sega?
4554240	4558160	Have you talked to your people to talk to Sega's people about I think a class to come back
4558160	4564280	I I've been writing them for years and I you know, I had a restraining order like six years ago
4564280	4569080	But that's that's expired now. I should talk to you know be world after them. I mean what they'll happen. I
4569720	4571640	don't know like
4571640	4574440	Shinobi world was like the last thing I ever did and

4598240	4600680	Which would be 10 copies of the Sonic the Hedgehog game?
4602240	4607520	All right, well 360 Alex kid is there a way we would see you on a virtual console at some point I
4607520	4614240	I I don't know. Oh, I'd like to I I'd started writing in Nintendo and I started telling them, you know
4614240	4620720	Bring back those master system games because nobody played them because your system kicked up kicked our systems ass. What happened there?

4785880	4792920	We'll go over here. Hi. Hello to you too. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's a share
4792920	4800120	I say show what's on your mind buddy? No rice. I finally got final fancy 12 rice princess cheering over here
4802920	4807000	You finally that's right fall fancy 12 finally made its way to the UK shores this week and
4807600	4811080	Thank you for not still it spoiling it because it's fucking epic
4811080	4816160	I it is it is fucking epic in every system where you've probably actually played more of it than I have because my friends stole
4816160	4819200	It there's one of my one of my friends will only play Final Fantasy games
4819200	4823040	It's the only games he'll play and he took my PlayStation 2 when Final Fantasy 12 came out. Oh,
4823960	4829360	Should be more for that. All right. Well, uh, you gotta take a moment to sell the you know
4829360	4834920	The listeners who feel that orange lounge radio is too gay for their tastes then Final Fantasy 12 probably is too
4834920	4839920	So sell our listeners on orange our sell sell our listeners on Final Fantasy 12 if you would
4839920	4847960	Um, get it because it's like epic and if you play Final Fantasy 11, you'll love it because
4848760	4853040	It's just fucking it's Final Fantasy 11, but with an actual story
4853040	4857200	I guess rice princess made a face because she hates Final Fantasy 11
4857200	4862480	I hate 11, but I love 12 because and there's a bunny lady named Fran
4864040	4866760	She can look at her butt. So that's why you should play the game
4866760	4871360	But Maury in our chat room says fucking epic is now my new phrase of the week
4873240	4876440	Today's secret word every time you hear the secret word screaming out
4880000	4883640	All right, so that's all you've been playing as fun as 12 non-stop
4884200	4887160	Pretty much. How is the cosplay over there when the game came out?
4887160	4889960	Did you go one of those midnight parties with the cosplay and all that stuff?
4890520	4895860	Um, I went to my local Astra midnight and I was like two people queuing up for it. And that was it
4895860	4899020	I was quite shocked. Don't you love how they call it a queue?
4901220	4903220	Is he gonna go into battlegrounds? No
4904260	4906260	No, we're just teasing
4906260	4911300	Anything else going on in British news that we are might be overlooking what hey, I got a question for you
4911300	4917900	What's a game that still hasn't come out over there that we have over here? That's pissing you off. Was there anything? Um,
4919420	4920860	Supernova
4920860	4928140	Dance Dance Revolution supernova. Oh, yeah dancing stage supernova cuz heaven forbid I say revolution in a British territory
4928540	4935760	But oh, that's I don't know I could well why else don't they call it Dance Dance Revolution over there? I don't know
4936660	4941900	Anyhow, um, well, they're really they have a completely different song list right station one. So I don't know
4942580	4944580	Did they call it Dance Dance Revolution on PlayStation 1?
4945140	4947140	Yeah, that's weird first mix
4947140	4951300	What don't you get it like in two weeks? Like it's really close to coming out, isn't it? I
4952580	4955860	Think so, but I don't know if that's a real release date

4959780	4964500	Universe next week and I'm pretty excited about that. Yeah, I'm very excited about DDR universe
