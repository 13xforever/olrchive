14453	26373	Tonight, February 25th, 2007, plenty of new games for the Virtual Console are discovered, some Xbox 360 games are getting a price cut, and one TV station warns us about sexual predators on online games.
32816	33357	Orange Lounge Radio
44870	45891	My name is Rob Roberts.
45911	47032	You might know me as Sky.
47392	50115	If you play games online, you might see me post on forums.
50835	54378	Not joining us tonight, sadly, is DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.
54398	56960	She had some prior family engagements to attend to.
57321	60363	We will be hearing from her in a special pre-tape segment later in the show.
60764	64527	But we've secretly replaced DarkSakura with a furry gay man tonight.
64567	66408	Say hello to Eddie.
67429	68730	I'm yummy.
69131	69951	Oh, Casper the Gay.
69971	71613	Am I supposed to refer to you as Casper the Gay?
71633	72133	Yeah, pretty much.
72153	72654	No, it's all right.
72734	73054	I don't care.
73672	74853	How are you doing, Casper?
75013	75473	I'm great.
75693	78355	I came down here having a good time.
78395	79616	You remember those old commercials?
79696	84859	It's like, we secretly replaced so-and-so's folgers with the new decap.
84899	85619	I don't know what the hell it is.
85939	89281	I feel like we secretly replaced Jamie with a furry gay man.
90202	91343	And they'll never know.
93064	93284	All right.
93564	96706	Well, also joining us tonight, the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
96726	97446	Hello.
98127	100048	And we did not replace him with a furry gay man.
100488	100808	Thank God.
100828	101029	Did we?
101049	101529	Did we?
103092	103652	No, we didn't.
103872	104733	Alright, how you doing, Loki?
105093	105713	I'm doing fine.
105954	106614	Good, good to hear.
106634	109715	I'm glad to see you're eating healthy tonight with the old Mickey D's.
110296	113918	You know, their sweet and sour sauce tastes like it's been sitting out for a long time.
114678	115658	It tastes a little off.
116399	123963	But that does not mean that I'm not gonna, you know, and I'm also disappointed they only got two packets of sweet and sour sauce versus three, because three's a lot better.
124023	127244	Doesn't McDonald's have some stupid policy, like if you order Yates or any nuggets?
127264	128705	Yeah, but ten pieces, I'm supposed to get three.
129925	130905	They fucking jipped me.
130925	133106	Why don't you go in and ask to speak with the manager?
133446	133946	Because I don't care.
133966	134786	You can be one of those people.
134826	153990	I'm sure anybody in our chat room who's worked for fast food in the past has some story about some fucking bitch who came in there because they wanted extra sauce or, you know, oh, you got to let the people at the drive-thru who order, like, I want a super-sized burger, chicken McNuggets, super-sized fries, oh, and a Diet Coke.
156041	160785	Or even better, I want a six-piece McNugget with 12 sides of sweet and sour sauce.
160865	163306	That's right, it makes me angsty.
163326	165448	Makes me angsty.
166229	168430	Goddammit, that's the second week in a row that's happened with him.
168450	169911	That's more than a second week in a row.
169931	171612	That's been like four weeks in a row.
171713	173634	I've been doing it on purpose.
173914	176956	Alright, say hello as well tonight to... Murder!
177577	178898	Say hello to Rice Princess.
179517	180338	How you doing, Rice Princess?
180698	182780	Now's when you're supposed to cue One Wing Angel.
183881	184301	That's all right.
184521	185242	How you doing, Rice Princess?
185262	185922	I'm doing pretty good.
186203	187263	I'm eating McDonald's, too.
188444	190086	I'm eating McDonald's, too.
190226	191187	Is this loud enough?
191287	191807	Yeah, see?
191927	194890	Now, tonight I'm letting you see the monitor so you can see what you're allowed to do.
194930	197692	Can I have a not-crappy mic to talk into?
197732	200935	Because I hate yelling and making it sound like I'm falling off a cliff.
201375	201615	All right.
201655	202476	How you doing, though, otherwise?
202896	203777	Pretty good.
203937	204217	All right.
204478	204778	Yep.
205714	207836	All right, well, also say hello to our chat room.
207936	209338	Always another guest here on the program.
209398	212001	It's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
212401	213522	Hello, I'm in the chat room.
214603	218347	I noticed Tiger Claw in the chat room says, Sky, you do know the Oscars are on.
219028	219328	Yep.
220369	223072	Well, last week it was the Grammys, or two weeks ago it was the Grammys.
223393	224514	This week it's the Oscars.
224554	225175	We just can't win.
225315	226416	We're always up against something.
226756	227437	I mean, but come on.
228240	228640	Who cares?
228660	230961	You're going to be able to read it tomorrow morning who won the Oscars.
231021	237165	And let's be honest, you and I both know most people listen to this show in the audio archive or podcast form.
237745	240766	And they can listen to that in the convenience of whenever they want.
241087	243048	So it won't be up against the Oscars in that regard.
243068	244728	So we have to just keep doing the show like always.
245169	252612	Because if you want, I mean if you don't want us to talk about video games, we could just kind of like turn on the Oscars and just give live commentary.
253193	254513	God, Kate Winslet looks fat.
254793	255394	Wouldn't that be fun?
256693	257374	I did see two.
257694	261517	I will say Oscar chat real fast, even though we're supposed to be keeping the random down tonight.
261837	265420	I will say I saw that Notes on a Scandal, which is the one that Judi Dench is nominated for.
265440	266460	I went out and saw that last night.
267201	267661	It's pretty good.
268702	270523	Judi Dench plays a good, crazy old woman.
270864	271324	She really does.
271384	273606	I hope she wins, but I didn't see The Queen.
273806	274767	I hear that was really good, too.
274807	277869	But Judi Dench, has she ever been bad in any movie?
277889	277989	Nope.
278009	278549	I don't think she has.
279210	279490	All right.
281830	285235	Joshi16 in the chatroom has some harsh words for the podcast listeners.
285255	287538	He said, podcast equals lazy fans.
290001	290201	Ouch.
290862	291583	Burn.
292156	320969	Alright, well let's get right into how we always start off the show A little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week Where we talk about what we've been playing And usually our chatroom gets into it too Oh, first off, speaking of chatroom, I want to say hi to the new listeners I always make a chance to try to say hi to noobs that are in chat Little thing noob Misty's not a noob, she's a long time listener She's in chat tonight, she hasn't been there for a long time So hi Misty Frisbee, I don't recognize that name And if I'm mistakenly pegging you as the new listener, I miss you, I apologize My brain can only hold so much
321668	325250	I don't recognize HeOn64, that must be new, so welcome.
325310	329353	Proper T, RoboBoy, actually maybe there's been a RoboBoy before, I don't know.
329653	330593	RoboBoy, I don't recognize you.
330613	334436	So hi noobs, or people I'm calling noobs because I didn't recognize your name.
334756	335356	Welcome to chat.
336457	338538	We have a lot of folks in chat tonight, a lot of regulars in there.
338578	339839	We appreciate your support as always.
340399	348444	But again, if you can't listen to us live because some of you guys have other things to do on Sunday nights like Oscar parties or whatever stupid stuff you're doing, you can always download our podcast.
348786	350887	Send us emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
350927	353368	Leave us voicemails, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
353428	354008	Okay, I'll shut up.
354128	355309	Loki, how was your gaming week?
356709	357650	My gaming week was good.
357750	359290	It was all crackdown.
359731	361051	Lots and lots of crackdown.
361211	362212	And the game is awesome.
362552	368074	Except some co-op, depending on who you're playing with, I guess, can be very buggy or very laggy.
368134	376117	Like, I played a co-op game with Jeremy Todd 1 today, and yeah, it was pretty bad.
376197	377098	Like, I couldn't even...
378141	378702	and DarkSakura.com.
401556	402397	So that's pretty fun.
402957	405338	But the game itself is just really keeping my attention.
405678	419706	I'm hoping for some good download content later on because I think once I do finish the game and finally do get the rest of the achievements, it might just kind of crash for me because you need to have some really co-op stuff to be able to get a lot out of the game.
419786	422007	But it's fun so far, though.
422227	422568	I love it.
424329	428691	Then, of course, the typical Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories.
429834	433097	and my second PSP that I'm fixing.
433217	439823	It's all fixed now, but I have to order a new faceplate button for it because I bought the third party faceplate for it and it sucks balls.
440064	445468	So, always stick with first party stuff because the third party clear ones, they suck.
446810	451294	I think that's all I've really played other than, you know, just Crackdown.
451954	452815	So, yeah, kind of
453732	454173	Thanks for watching!
469977	470818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
492246	496449	You can open your game up and then they can join it, but the inviting is broken.
496969	498871	So that's supposed to be fixed in a later patch.
499271	502193	So when are you going to let me play Crackdown so I can decide if it's worth the $60 or not?
502933	503994	Well, I still want to play it.
504114	504434	All right.
504894	508417	Well, you're going to come over at some point and show it to me, right?
508537	509457	I had it here today.
509497	512299	Because I didn't get the demo, quote-unquote.
512319	512900	I didn't get it.
513020	514501	I suck at those type of games.
514521	519064	Maybe you can see my save game where you can fire homing missiles at people.
519444	519644	All right.
520687	521168	Let's see, what else?
521570	522714	That's it for your gaming week?
522734	523176	That's it.
523637	526026	My gaming week was mostly World of Warcraft, as I said.
526087	526629	Kid Icarus.
527068	528129	A lot on Nintendo.
528209	529570	Dude, it's awesome.
529610	530911	It's hard as hell, but it's fun.
530931	531952	That's the hardest game ever.
532392	538917	Dude, when I beat the first dungeon this week, I thought I was the shit because I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm over 21 and I can still beat the first dungeon.
539777	541298	I still have some skill at this game.
541358	541558	Yes.
542039	543260	It was like getting to hear the theme.
543480	548604	How many people have actually heard other music in the game besides the very first stage?
548704	549284	Not a lot.
549744	550285	Exactly.
551426	556109	Most people have only heard the first stage music, so it's kind of neat to hear the second stage theme.
556516	560199	Anyway, I'm sure there's a lot of listeners that are like, I already beat the game, Rob.
560219	560920	What's taking you so long?
561340	564483	Yeah, I'm nine years old, and I beat the game like 500 times.
564684	565084	I'm doing it.
565144	565965	I was nine years old.
566005	567426	I beat the game 500 times, too.
567987	570889	But also, I used Icarus Fights Medusa Angels.
570949	582420	Anyway, also, I went to the arcade this week, which was kind of cool because I had a date Friday, and he actually wanted to go to the arcade because we didn't really have a set plan.
583093	583914	YoungSung is awesome
612043	612223	Uh-huh.
642122	644483	No, to answer chat, I do not have a boyfriend.
644523	646284	I think he listens to this once in a while.
646324	646964	I went on a date.
647004	647664	There's a big difference.
648745	649245	God, anyway.
650965	652666	I shouldn't talk about my personal life on this program.
652686	653847	Yeah, you shouldn't.
653927	654207	What else?
654227	654887	I really shouldn't.
655167	657168	Oh, I played Mario Kart Arcade, which was fun.
657408	661009	Because they fixed their machine at Golf Land, and now the picture camera thing works again.
661049	661550	It's a lot of fun.
661790	662730	I actually won the race.
662990	664251	I'm getting good at Mario Kart Arcade.
664271	665991	That must be on easy, too.
666011	667292	No, we played a normal track.
667312	668392	We didn't play the easiest one.
668412	669173	We played on normal.
669513	670213	No, I swear.
670968	672929	Yeah, but that game's a waste of money, man.
672989	674070	It's kind of hokey.
674290	678013	Mario Kart in the arcade does not nearly have the same magic as it does at home.
678113	683936	Why don't you just take a picture of yourself and, like, tape it to the screen if you really want your face on the thing?
684557	687959	It would be better if you had, like, eight of those machines.
689540	690961	Then it would be better with the pictures.
691021	694483	Like, I could see, like, a Dave & Buster's having all these machines next to each other.
694503	696104	In fact, I bet there's a Dave & Buster's somewhere that has it.
696445	698526	But when you only have two, it is kind of hokey.
699031	701552	and the game itself is not the same magic as the home.
701772	702432	It's really not.
702532	704053	It's like a whole different engine or something.
704433	710975	If you want to see the Mario Kart arcade, by the way, search for Orange Lounge on YouTube and there's a video of Loki playing Mario Kart drunk.
711055	711615	It's hilarious.
711755	712555	At his bachelor party.
712835	713355	Awesome.
713475	713675	Yeah.
714116	715456	We need to put more crap on YouTube.
716096	718717	Eddie, you're a camera person, right?
718917	721178	Yeah, I have a digital camera where we can download stuff.
721278	721918	Yeah.
721978	722958	Just took it up to the USB.
723218	723959	You need to do video.
723979	725999	You need to be like our official Orange Lounge videographer.
726459	727160	Seriously, yeah.
727180	727660	That's what I'll do.
727680	728500	That would be rad.
729335	729795	Let's do that.
729935	730336	It's on.
730796	731036	All right.
731116	731496	It's on.
732597	732977	All right.
733417	736118	Anyhow, let's go around and figure out some other gaming weeks.
736378	737479	Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
738619	740560	Oh, more wow.
741561	741941	Yep.
742301	743222	Good times on there.
743302	751586	Oh, I'm so happy because, like, my 29 Rogue on Elder Thales, I got some poor sap to give me a plus 15 agi on my dagger.
752126	753106	And that's kind of expensive.
753126	754407	Did you just call it agi?
755507	755988	Agility.
756528	757309	It's Agility.
757489	757989	Agility.
758189	758950	I call it Agi.
758970	760631	Agi is how you abbreviate it.
760652	762593	Agi is going to be a punch in your face.
762853	765075	Oh, Rice Princess, you make me lull.
765896	767818	Oh, Rob, DF, please.
768638	769039	Please.
769719	771140	Roltfulamow.
771661	772662	Roltfulamow.
772742	777406	Roltfulamow.
777626	778086	JK.
778887	779167	Anyway.
779327	779928	Oh, my gosh.
780468	781109	Now I'm going to leave.
781673	786816	No, but yeah, it's pretty much been wow, whoop-dee-doo, good wow times.
787216	792559	I played for about, I don't know, like an hour, hour and a half on Back Me Wool, and I did two quests.
793040	794380	I don't even know why I went on.
794781	799363	I'm like, man, and they were in the Barrens, so you know how you could do like ten quests at the same time in the Barrens?
799843	801825	I'm like, I'll just not do anything.
801845	803486	Because you got tied up in Barrens chat?
804006	805747	No, I got tied up in Gchat, yo.
806701	809523	Oh, I'm sorry, Guild Chat, let's not abbreviate that.
809543	810204	Yes, please, thank you.
810264	812186	Yeah, Guild Chat, sorry.
813006	814307	So, yeah.
815168	817830	Do you actually sign on to the Guild and go, what up, G?
818791	819071	No.
819632	820212	Oh, just curious.
820492	821813	Eddie, how was your gaming week?
821954	822434	It was awesome.
822454	825216	I've been doing the virtual console thing, too, so I got Donkey Kong Country.
825657	827078	Oh my god, that game still kicks ass.
827558	828079	I love that game.
828639	833523	Yeah, but it's not as good because I have GameCube controllers for my Wii instead of the classic controllers, and that doesn't work.
834043	834564	But it's still fun.
835481	835862	and DarkSakura.
854451	855252	Game Genie Code or something.
881152	884715	If you have a normal NES... Wasn't Rygar so hard because you couldn't save it?
884935	886476	Or you couldn't... Like, you had to do it in one sitting?
886496	888638	I don't think there was a... Yeah, you had to do it in... You had to do it in one sitting.
888658	890699	And you could only continue, I think, so many times, too.
890719	891420	Yeah.
891660	892901	So, it was pretty hard.
893161	894723	Yeah, that's how all games were back in the day, though.
896084	896744	Yeah, I guess.
898666	898866	Alright.
898926	901007	I'm looking at what's going on in chatroom.
901328	904130	Jvmon says, Sky, are you fucking with Rice Princess's volume?
904150	904350	Yes.
904650	906632	Sorry if you are noticing audio problems.
906672	908293	I'm fucking with her volume as she's talking because...
908737	910838	RicePrincess has a naturally quiet voice.
911279	912640	I'm trying to be loud.
913080	914681	Oh, man, am I, like, super loud now?
914761	916782	Like, can two people in China hear me now?
916902	917443	I think we're good.
917543	921845	But make sure if Loki talks, he uses this mic and not the one you're on.
922026	922366	Okay.
922586	923507	Okay.
923567	923887	Thank you.
924427	924687	All right.
926188	928490	Because I guess the guys in studio have louder voices.
928530	929630	Anyway, not that you guys want to know that.
930671	932052	Eddie, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
933393	933693	Nope.
934814	935054	All right.
935543	936583	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
961001	962002	Beat the Host Beat the Host
986775	987916	because it's going to be killer.
987956	990038	It's way harder than any of the others we've done, I think.
990378	991659	There's some that are easy, but some are hard.
991679	992599	But we'll get into that in part three.
992619	994741	I was like five years old when the arcade games were popular.
994761	996723	I know, so don't pick me.
996743	997943	You better pick Loki, I guess.
997983	999605	He might be the only challenge in here.
999625	999945	We'll see.
1000365	1005129	Or you can pick Rice Princess just to embarrass her with her lack of classic arcade knowledge.
1005149	1005849	So this will be fun.
1006770	1007591	All right, we'll see what happens.
1007631	1008371	That would suck.
1008952	1009212	All right.
1010334	1012176	Thank you for watching!
1028167	1030648	It's not a very well hidden secret.
1030668	1032709	It looks like a little text drawn smiley.
1033009	1035410	And what happens when you go into it, it's the Warp Zone.
1035690	1038531	And it's this new area on the Wii called the Nintendo Warp Zone.
1038991	1042212	And what the Warp Zone has is just like some trivia and cool stuff.
1042232	1044633	And right now what they have on there is some little Kirby trivia.
1044873	1050195	They have Kirby history and Kirby trivia, which would make sense because obviously the Kirby game... Did they get the Kirby game in Europe?
1050555	1051476	Released on their console yet?
1051516	1052296	I know we got it here.
1052736	1055957	But I'm assuming Kirby Europe, if they don't already have it, isn't far behind.
1056518	1057238	And that...
1057916	1065400	is kind of opening the potential to having this cool little, you know, Nintendo fan niche center that is possible to show up on the Wii.
1065640	1068641	And I'm betting if the UK has it, we're going to get it any day now here in the US.
1068661	1069962	Well, they also did a new channel.
1070002	1071302	They did the Everybody Votes channel.
1071602	1072623	That's last week's news, buddy.
1072643	1073103	Yeah, but whatever.
1073143	1074304	But they could have that on that, too.
1074344	1076905	Like, you could vote on, like, you know, different Nintendo trivia.
1077445	1080567	Well, that's what a lot of people are saying they should have done with the Everybody Votes channels.
1080587	1082067	They should have had Nintendo trivia and stuff.
1082448	1084088	Or, like, who do you like better?
1084268	1085549	Mario, Luigi, that type of thing.
1086351	1086711	and DarkSakura.com.
1116082	1117002	Right.
1117042	1118383	The music in the forecast channel is off.
1119243	1121344	Okay, obviously I'm reaching, I'm sorry.
1122464	1124285	JV Mon says, I use the weather channel.
1125545	1128046	GS68 is calling Loki the resident Wii hater.
1129647	1130387	I think that's not true.
1130887	1131707	Loki loves his Wii.
1131727	1137269	Right, yeah, I totally hate my Wii that I bought with, you know, tons of games and stuff.
1137489	1139990	Oh no, you didn't have to camp out because of distribution, but whatever.
1140550	1142091	That you got on launch day or before.
1142171	1144172	No, you had your Wii like three days before launch.
1144192	1144952	I remember going over there.
1145212	1145332	Mm-hmm.
1145876	1147677	playing that horrible, horrible Red Steel.
1149397	1153758	We didn't play Red Steel the first day, but you played it at the party, and that was awful.
1153919	1154379	It doesn't matter.
1154419	1154859	Nobody cares.
1155119	1157100	No, it's not okay with me.
1157160	1158360	It's a horrible game.
1159060	1159780	Horrible game.
1161741	1164242	No, just Red Steel, because Red Steel sucks balls.
1164762	1171364	Anyways, one thing that will not suck balls, hopefully, is going to be some Neo Geo and MSX games coming to
1171909	1179834	The Virtual Console, and, um, the first couple titles, at least the MSX titles, um, and this is gonna be on the Japanese service, of course, for right now.
1180335	1187519	Uh, Egi and Aleste are gonna be the first, um, MSX titles, and they're gonna be 800 Wii points each.
1188040	1189981	Then, both are due out in spring.
1190641	1195204	Um, hopefully we'll see some more, um, SNK stuff come over.
1195284	1198967	You know, personally, I'd hope that for, like, Magical Lord, and, um,
1200706	1203387	No Metal Slug, because my god, how many times have I read it?
1203527	1204348	Oh, I don't know.
1204408	1206248	How about Fatal Fury Special?
1206328	1208890	One of my favorite fighting games ever, next to Street Fighter.
1208990	1210010	Are you being sarcastic?
1210070	1212051	No, I fucking love Fatal Fury Special.
1212291	1213051	I like Fatal Fury.
1213091	1214212	I like King of Fighters.
1214672	1215732	Samurai Shodown.
1216373	1219394	They need Samurai Shodown, because that was great, too.
1219414	1223516	Yeah, or the best fucking game on Neo Geo ever, Magical Drop.
1224376	1226257	Or King of Monsters, I think.
1227406	1229007	Yeah, good times.
1229087	1232590	That's very interesting, because did they say that at launch, that they were going to partner with Neo Geo?
1232630	1233110	I don't think they did.
1233130	1234491	I remember hearing about MSX.
1234591	1245299	I remember MSX, which was very exciting, because a lot of people were going, ooh, now we can get the true sequel to Metal Gear and all that stuff that was only on the MSX, like the Metal Gear 2, not that Snake's Revenge stuff we had here in the US.
1246080	1250323	Or just being able to play the original Metal Gear in the MSX format might be kind of interesting.
1251304	1255247	They could retranslate it so that you don't have, you know, the truck have started to move.
1255587	1256808	No, they should keep that in there.
1257335	1261499	Yeah, probably, I don't know I'm not really familiar with the MSX too much, so I don't know
1277648	1278708	What was the name of that game?
1279209	1281970	Blue's Journey or Blue's Adventure or something like that?
1281990	1282650	Blue's Clues?
1282930	1283290	No!
1283450	1284851	We just figured out Blue's Clues.
1285151	1287392	You can get off the show now.
1287672	1290253	No, it was the one where he had... Never mind.
1290413	1291453	Nobody knows what I'm talking about.
1291834	1292194	Forget it.
1293194	1293514	Jerks.
1294555	1296075	What was I going to say?
1296095	1297936	What else on Neo Geo?
1298436	1303058	As long as we don't get 50,000 clones of Puzzle Bobble like there were in the arcade.
1303178	1305779	Every year there's a new Puzzle Bobble and it's always the same damn game.
1306067	1307108	It's the same thing.
1307148	1308469	Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of that.
1309250	1311431	Even though I love, like, puzzle games and stuff.
1311872	1313793	ShadowCharlie wants to see Super Baseball 2020.
1313914	1314374	Okay.
1315975	1317336	RobD wants to see King of Fighters 98.
1317817	1319178	Hell yeah.
1319218	1320219	Lots of King of Fighters games, too.
1320239	1320979	All the King of Fighters games.
1320999	1322941	But I don't mind seeing new ones of those every year.
1323161	1323842	Yeah, seriously.
1324242	1324642	That's awesome.
1324662	1326444	Yeah, they need to, like, keep making them.
1326464	1326804	Thank you.
1326864	1328205	HitStun remembers the translation.
1328386	1329386	I feel asleep.
1329506	1330727	It was I feel asleep.
1330767	1332249	That's awesome.
1332269	1333450	Thank you, HitStun.
1333490	1334130	Gold star for you.
1335791	1336251	Yep.
1337172	1338612	Alright, let's see.
1338792	1340473	Moving on with some other gaming news.
1341033	1343014	This, oh my gosh, this makes me so excited.
1343735	1348937	Square Enix is moving to put their first virtual console title on the Wii in Japan.
1349317	1356260	And if I tell you Square Enix is putting, unless you've already heard this, don't guess you've already heard, but if I told you Square Enix was putting a game on virtual console, what would you think it is?
1358061	1359102	Square Enix.
1359262	1360782	Like the original Final Fantasy, right?
1360802	1362243	That's what Eddie said in Final Fantasy?
1362263	1362343	Yeah.
1362859	1363680	Oh my god, what is it, Rob?
1363700	1364060	Oh my god!
1373629	1374710	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1396637	1400580	And for those of you guys that are listening live tonight, you're actually going to get a treat during our break.
1400700	1404783	We can't play it on the podcast because of copyright, but you're going to get Actraiser music during the break tonight because I love it that much.
1404823	1407064	So, Sky, when's that coming out on Virtual Console?
1407184	1408805	Well, we don't know yet.
1408905	1409266	Exactly.
1409286	1411907	We know it's going to be March in Japan.
1413268	1417031	But that's a good sign that it'll probably make its way over here, like end of March, April.
1417471	1418172	That's awesome.
1418652	1419713	I'm so downloading this.
1419733	1419913	Actraiser...
1420658	1422339	Actraiser 2 wasn't even that bad.
1422379	1424440	It's just that they took out the simulation element of the game.
1424520	1425660	The simulation was fun.
1425700	1429161	I mean, it was like a Greek, you know, you were developing a Greek civilization or whatever.
1429462	1435164	But Actraiser, seriously, the only problem with Actraiser is that you can blast through the game in about four hours.
1436204	1436744	Well, maybe longer.
1436764	1437625	Maybe just about four hours.
1437665	1439366	I remember beating it when I rented it in one night.
1439386	1441426	That's pretty similar to a lot of old games.
1441486	1443307	I mean, especially NES games.
1443367	1445948	Like, you could get through them in a couple hours.
1446048	1447909	Yeah, so that's okay.
1448644	1450306	I'm so freaking excited.
1450386	1450947	That's awesome.
1466806	1467406	Actraiser 2 Actraiser 1
1492728	1508415	You had those, you know, side-scrolling action stages like the Ghosts and Goblins type theme with just this most beautiful music you've ever heard in a Super Nintendo game mixed with simulation scenes that are so different but they blend in the game so well because you get things in the simulation scene that you use in the action scene.
1508755	1510916	I mean, one of the all-time greatest games.
1511276	1511696	Seriously.
1511756	1516138	Okay, am I thinking of the right game where you're like an angel and you go and you like... Yes, you can see its little butt.
1516358	1518499	When you fly, yes, you can see its little angel butt.
1518519	1519440	Pervert, only you would know that.
1519460	1519620	I know.
1519640	1521981	You're like, oh, hot angel butt.
1524028	1529731	Yeah, that's, or like, I don't know, you're an angel and you're like planting crops or something like that, and you're like... Oh, really?
1529971	1531212	In the side scrollers, you're a god?
1531392	1532412	Is that what you said, Eddie?
1532572	1532952	Yes.
1533193	1533573	Okay.
1534793	1535414	That's great.
1535834	1537094	I guess I didn't play enough of it.
1537595	1539035	No, yeah, that was the whole theme of the game.
1539075	1539536	You were a god.
1540036	1540136	Oh.
1541397	1548580	And you had to go down to Earth to fix the suffering, and it's actually, actually, like, the music fits the emotion of the game, like, so well.
1548860	1550941	I'm sorry, I sound like such a ham, but it's true.
1550961	1552522	Like, it's one of the early, great
1552884	1553550	Did you cry?
1555643	1556764	No, not at that.
1556964	1558525	I did cry at a Super Nintendo game, though.
1558625	1559186	Which one?
1559266	1559526	Tell me.
1559546	1560167	I'm not telling you.
1560187	1561387	Tell me, damn it.
1561428	1562248	Tell me right now.
1562428	1562568	No.
1562608	1563609	I'm going to punch you in your face.
1563629	1564150	Final Fantasy 3.
1564210	1564890	Final Fantasy 2.
1565791	1566391	Oh, my God.
1566511	1567772	Was it because it was so bad?
1567872	1572196	No, because I beat it, and the ending was so great, and then I was sad because it was over.
1572396	1574818	You're like, finally, I beat a game in my life.
1574838	1576699	I was freaking like 12 years old, okay?
1576739	1577800	I wasn't like bawling.
1577840	1582083	I was like... It wasn't like when I saw Dancer in the Dark the first time, okay?
1582263	1583064	It was just like a little bit...
1584745	1585946	I'm sad it's over.
1586466	1587386	Tear, tear.
1587847	1588427	Alright, anyway.
1589167	1589427	Sorry.
1590008	1595210	Anyways, well, if ActRaiser isn't your cup of tea, there's going to be some more stuff coming from Sega.
1595410	1597571	Seriously, I want you to unsubscribe from this show.
1598232	1601673	If ActRaiser is not your cup of tea, you do not deserve to listen to... No, I'm kidding.
1601713	1602874	Obviously, I'm kidding.
1602894	1604154	There goes all of our listeners.
1604334	1604755	Bye, guys.
1604775	1605535	It's nice knowing you.
1606055	1608476	Anyways, some new titles from Sega.
1608516	1613739	We're going to see Sword of a Million, Vector Man, Sonic Spinball, and Beyond Oasis.
1614843	1617444	So those should be coming within the next couple weeks.
1618424	1625506	And there was also some other stuff I was just reading here last minute from Hudson that was coming out on the Virtual Console, and these are also kind of exciting.
1625526	1630728	You're going to be getting Double Dungeons and Splatterhouse in March.
1631168	1632748	Oh, God, Splatterhouse.
1633028	1634209	Dude, Phantasy Star, for real?
1635649	1635909	Yeah.
1635929	1638050	Yeah, Phantasy Star's coming out, too, for Virtual Console.
1639210	1639730	That's awesome.
1639890	1640450	Where'd you hear that?
1641691	1642331	From the Internet.
1643576	1644077	Sonic Spinball
1660250	1664291	because he mentioned it, is one of those games, like, complete opposite end from Actraiser, okay?
1664311	1668351	It's one of those games that, like, you remember as being really cool.
1668571	1673732	Like, you know, oh, it's Sonic, it's a pinball game, and oh, I remember this game was just so awesome.
1674072	1676773	And then you play it for five minutes and you go, God, this shit's boring.
1677933	1678213	Isn't it?
1678273	1678833	Is it just me?
1679633	1685554	No, it's kind of like you, like, when I go around you and then you start talking to me for about five minutes, I'm like, I want to go home.
1685574	1689695	Except not really, because I love you, Rob Hearts, to you.
1690555	1692336	This will be the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio you ever hear.
1693757	1694377	Bye.
1694397	1699220	Speaking of people that shouldn't be talking more than five minutes at a time, Perrin Kaplan.
1700603	1703104	Open her mouth about some new things going on the Wii.
1703344	1709766	By the way, I believe Perrin Kaplan also said that the GameCube had been ceased production, that there's no more GameCubes, right?
1709806	1714427	And then it came out later in the week that, oh, just kidding, we really haven't stopped making the GameCubes.
1714887	1718728	I think Perrin Kaplan is kind of like, I kind of treat her like opposite woman.
1719248	1722909	Like when she says something, the opposite is actually true.
1723050	1724570	It's this clever marketing ploy.
1724590	1728171	Yeah, anytime she talks, it's like, oh, introduction to the opposites.
1729688	1730548	DVD playback enabled on it.
1730629	1731229	Oh my god.
1758615	1759075	Who cares?
1759095	1760396	What do you mean, oh my god?
1760896	1763938	How many DVD players do you have in your house?
1765178	1765739	Three or four.
1766539	1767679	So do you need another one on the Wii?
1767860	1768400	I don't think so.
1769740	1770181	Who cares?
1771041	1772342	Bring the pink Wii out already.
1772482	1777144	I don't think anyone's not buying the Wii because it doesn't have DVD playback.
1777184	1779385	I know that's just a stupid feature anyways.
1780005	1783007	I mean, it's kind of thrown in because they're DVD-ROM drives.
1783367	1785068	Might as well just put the codecs in there.
1785626	1789410	Yeah, that was popular like five years ago when nobody had a DVD, and now it's like, eh.
1790832	1791293	Exactly.
1791453	1794877	So, I mean, the GameCube didn't really play DVDs, so...
1796206	1796986	Who gives a shit?
1797107	1802490	Looking at our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, SpeedyF40 says, the GameCube will live on forever.
1803030	1805271	Well, yeah, because the Wii will play all your GameCube games.
1805491	1810014	So, I mean, seriously, when I heard that the GameCube was going away, I was like, well, that makes sense.
1810054	1818759	But the best part about the Wii playing the GameCube games, and I always have to explain this to my customers that are renting out GameCube games for the Wii and stuff, if you don't have GameCube controllers, you're fucked.
1819039	1820019	I, third-party controllers.
1820039	1820620	I'm just saying.
1840542	1843744	Uh, let's see, Actdeft says, who the hell listens to Perrin Kaplan?
1844004	1847987	Okay, look, show me five gaming blogs that did not run the story this week, okay?
1848247	1849848	That run stories on Nintendo, usually.
1850108	1853911	The thing is, is that whatever she says makes it onto every major gaming blog out there, so.
1854131	1855912	And for some reason we posted that as well.
1856713	1860775	Uh, Joshi16 says, she is a classic Contrary Mary.
1862056	1863237	I've never heard that term before.
1863297	1863857	Wow.
1864197	1865398	Contrary Mary.
1865919	1868200	Contrary, Contrary Mary, I guess I'm putting it.
1868447	1869167	Contrary Mary?
1869187	1870948	The emphasis on the wrong syllable.
1870968	1873288	Did somebody say Contra?
1873928	1874949	What, did somebody say Contra?
1874989	1875569	No, Contrary.
1877289	1878269	Let's see, what else is there?
1879070	1883391	Let's see, FootyMonster... No, I'm sorry, who said it was a selling point?
1884531	1886691	Damn it, somebody in chat room, I'm sorry, whoever said it.
1887112	1888272	Oh, FootyMonster did say it.
1888292	1891293	It doesn't matter, Sky, it's a selling point, talking about the DVD playback.
1891773	1895034	Yeah, just like... I don't know, who cares, really?
1895334	1896314	Well, they, I don't know...
1897591	1898732	Fix their online!
1899192	1905117	That'd be great, let's fix the online, something that we're actually going to use instead of... Let's make DVD playback.
1905637	1906237	All in time.
1906317	1909940	Yeah, okay, we've established that you're the only one that the messages don't download when it's off.
1910180	1911321	No, it doesn't work for me either.
1911461	1913363	It works for me, because I'm cooler than you.
1913383	1915264	Maybe because you have that USB, you have a dongle.
1915964	1918706	You use your dongle, and the dongle makes it all work.
1918726	1922269	It does look like a penis for... It does quite look like a penis for the computer.
1922809	1923910	Anyway, moving right along.
1924190	1924771	Anyways, so...
1925847	1934832	If you're looking forward to more independent games on the Wii, they have this big program that they were touting originally, saying that they were going to fund a bunch of independent games.
1935112	1941075	This whole independent developer program in which they would give them free development kits and that kind of stuff.
1941530	1944693	Well, the only problem is they don't have enough development kits to go around.
1944853	1948295	Apparently, they're also in short supply just like the actual Wii's are.
1948896	1954460	So, a lot of these independent developers aren't going to get to make their crappy ports of games that they probably already released.
1954621	1961746	Well, the sad part of that is, though, for those that were wondering, where are the downloadable indie games on the virtual console?
1962367	1967631	They haven't even... They're just a... They're a twinkle in mommy's eye right now because there's no dev kits.
1967731	1968151	That's it.
1969653	1969973	What?
1969993	1970073	What?
1970734	1971175	Nevermind.
1987640	1989221	on the Wii.
1989541	1992382	Yes, it's a game where you shoot chickens.
1992422	1995743	Dude, if it's like Duck Hunt with chickens, sold.
1996043	1997543	Oh my god, chicken shit.
1997563	2000724	They can instantly sell that title if they just change it to Cock Shoot.
2000804	2001805	Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
2002185	2002705	Who are you?
2003185	2004666	Oh, by the way, this is LankyStyle.
2004926	2006226	Long time no hearer.
2007686	2008507	Long time listener.
2009027	2010767	Long time listener, first time caller.
2011328	2015909	Now, you've been on the show before, but not in its podcast form, so nobody knows who you are, in other words.
2016252	2018633	Okay, well, I'm just the nameless voice.
2018673	2019833	Well, wait, really quickly.
2020213	2021914	Your three favorite games of all time and why?
2022414	2022874	Really quickly.
2023355	2024495	So we know what type of gamer you are.
2024595	2030297	Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger, and... Chicken Shoot.
2034759	2036059	No, Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
2036239	2038520	All right, there you have it.
2038620	2039640	I do cosplay.
2041401	2041861	No, I'm kidding.
2042081	2043762	You know, he's a big fan of ActRaiser.
2044335	2045616	He played Act... You just missed it.
2045696	2047437	ActRacer's coming to Virtual Console in Japan.
2047777	2048157	Oh, I know.
2048397	2049098	I got a boat or two.
2049858	2050179	All right.
2050999	2051139	Ew.
2051499	2052180	So, yeah.
2052220	2052620	That's it.
2052740	2057163	No development kits for the poor independent folks, you know.
2058322	2058942	Poor them.
2059222	2060963	They can't get free development kits.
2062224	2062724	Aww.
2062764	2063124	QQ.
2063644	2065405	GS68 says, crack shoot.
2065705	2066705	How about instead of chicken shoot?
2067026	2069607	If they bring out chicken shoot, I think there should be another mode in it.
2069647	2073468	Like, you remember how a duck hunt had the duck shoot and then they had the skeet shooting?
2073488	2073908	Clay shooting, yeah.
2073928	2076229	They should have chicken shoot and waffle shoot.
2081050	2083452	SpeedyF40 wants to see Cockblock for the Wii.
2084633	2085193	Interesting tie.
2085213	2086874	Isn't that, what was that PSP game that we played?
2086894	2088335	Cockblock for the Wii.
2088355	2090536	What was that PSP game we played at the Konami?
2090576	2091037	Brooktown.
2091357	2092137	Isn't that kind of what?
2092457	2092738	What?
2093378	2093738	Forget it.
2094118	2094399	No.
2095059	2099221	That's just one of those games that's like, I'm so popular in the fictional high school.
2099842	2101563	If only it were true in real life.
2101743	2102563	Stick it in the game.
2104044	2104965	Stick it in the game.
2105685	2107506	No, stick it in, comma, the game.
2108047	2108327	Get it?
2108973	2113578	Nevermind, like Oonga Boonga That doesn't even make sense, you wouldn't even put a comma there Stick it in!
2113719	2119005	That's on WarioWare, Smooth Moves Is there a minigame on WarioWare, Smooth Moves, that's Stick It In?
2119285	2123350	No, you stick in the game Remember that one where you pushed it on the Super Nintendo game?
2123430	2125553	Nevermind Alright, moving on, anyway, um
2126624	2140614	Speaking of the Wii, since we have a lot of Wii news tonight, this is also noteworthy, because Wiis are still very hard to find, yet they have outsold the 360 and the PlayStation 3 in January, and this is some preliminary data that made its way onto the internet.
2141258	2151042	The Wii sold 436,000 units, 360, 294,000 units, PlayStation 3, 244,000 units.
2151082	2154523	So it's only 50,000 units separating 360 and PlayStation 3.
2155263	2158585	Then again, 360's been on the market for a year, so it doesn't look too good for Sony.
2159045	2164407	Sony might need some games to come out pretty soon to rescue them, but who knows what's going to happen.
2164887	2170009	Motorstorm's coming out in a couple weeks, and I cannot wait to play that average racing game.
2171539	2172319	But it's still fun.
2172540	2173440	It looks awesome.
2173460	2175721	Is it on the show world tonight?
2175881	2178363	I don't think we put Qbert or Flo or that stuff.
2178703	2185327	So I guess we could take a moment to mention that Qbert and Flo made its way to the... Yeah, I heard Qbert sucks and Flo is short.
2185407	2186627	I heard they redid Qbert.
2187208	2188108	And I heard it sucks.
2188288	2188548	Really?
2189049	2189749	I like Qbert.
2190849	2191430	I want to play it.
2191930	2192510	Will you download it?
2192550	2193251	Can I come over and play it?
2194171	2195672	I don't know if I want to waste that kind of money.
2195892	2196372	Oh, come on.
2196593	2197853	You bought a PlayStation 3.
2197973	2198954	Oh, wait, you didn't buy the PlayStation 3.
2199114	2200555	You bought games for the PlayStation 3.
2202592	2202772	I know.
2202792	2205675	You bought Ridge Racer 7 when you already had it when it was called Ridge Racer 6.
2205835	2207817	I know, and it still sucks!
2208477	2211560	And I bought Full Auto 2, and it's still Full Auto 1.
2211600	2216924	They just put it in new packaging and added a crappy deathmatch mode, and I was a sucker.
2217585	2219547	And I bought that crap.
2219767	2221148	You're getting some compliments tonight.
2221388	2223270	Sasha says Loki is great this evening.
2223710	2226853	And FootyMonster says Loki is picking up the slack for DarkSakura tonight.
2226873	2227894	He's like double pissed off.
2228494	2229655	I'm not pissed off, it's just...
2230965	2234926	I hate these games that they put out at launch, and they call it a sequel, and it's really not a sequel.
2234946	2241248	It's just, it's like fucking, it's like, a perfect example is, for the Wii, coming out next month, Prince of Persia Rival Swords.
2241288	2243489	It's fucking Two Thrones, all over again.
2243769	2248550	All you need to do is tack on some stupid controls to it, and added chariot racing.
2248691	2249831	Ooh, woohoo!
2250051	2250931	Chariot racing?
2250951	2253512	That was the only thing that was missing from the first one.
2253612	2256333	Oh god, I really wish there was chariot racing in this.
2258143	2259324	They got my letters.
2259544	2260785	Yes.
2260885	2264549	Raven's Dolphin in the chat room says, Flo is a beautiful screensaver.
2264969	2265589	Yeah, that's what I hear.
2265609	2266670	It's a screensaver that moves.
2266730	2267751	That's all the reviews I've heard.
2268012	2269453	Like, it's After Dark, the game.
2269873	2270253	Listen.
2270754	2271014	Okay.
2271495	2272656	Listen, Sony.
2273376	2278741	Stop making games that utilize this stupid tilt functionality crap.
2278761	2280803	Because, to be honest, they're not that great.
2280903	2281163	I mean...
2281786	2286548	Flow, okay, that's kind of cool, you know, because it was a cool web game when it was free and stuff.
2287828	2294351	But this, like, Super Rub-a-Dub or whatever it's coming out with the ducks, it's the same damn game again.
2294791	2300933	It's just like that other game that was out there right now that's kind of a clone of Geometry Wars.
2301273	2302354	That one sucks, too.
2302934	2304434	Stop releasing games.
2304494	2305815	It's just a stupid gimmick.
2307035	2309376	JeremyTodd1 in chat has some advice for Sony.
2309436	2311317	This is sure to make the Sony fanboys very pleased.
2311667	2313888	JeremyTodd1 says, I got an idea for what Sony should do.
2314368	2324254	I think Sony should go ride the rollercoaster of death right into the lake of fire, doom and torture, where its eyes will get ripped, and then they're forced to eat the eyes with a broken fork where they will continually watch bad TV shows over and over.
2325535	2328376	You can address those cards and letters to JeremyTodd1, care of Orange Lounge Radio.
2328396	2330497	Anyways, so more happy stuff, though.
2331258	2335460	Elite Beat Agents is getting a sequel, which isn't too surprising because the game is pretty awesome.
2336315	2341117	Um, so, definitely... Actually, it is surprising, because the game didn't sell as well as they thought it would, especially not in Japan.
2341397	2343718	Yeah, but it's Nintendo, they're not going to come up with anything original.
2343798	2344778	I mean, come on, they still got... What?
2344938	2346139	Are you smoking crack?
2346499	2347259	What is the Wii?
2347659	2348359	What is the Wii?
2348379	2351320	What do you mean Nintendo's not going to come up with something original?
2351801	2352721	Okay, let me see here.
2353281	2357282	Another Super Mario sequel, another Metroid sequel, another Donkey Kong sequel.
2357483	2358003	Woo!
2358343	2359463	That's brand new shit!
2359983	2361384	I think we got a Wii latest here.
2363112	2373678	Anyways, so Elite Beat Agents with yet more, you know, some different music because this is the natural progression of your, you know, music games is let's get some different music.
2374858	2384003	They're not really specifying a release date yet, but they're saying that the new game is going to have four-player action and it's going to have a new snappy title.
2386445	2386705	All right.
2387651	2389252	So I cannot wait for this game.
2389512	2391994	But they're saying that the Japanese version is getting a sequel.
2392034	2393255	We don't know about American yet, right?
2394655	2395836	No word on the U.S.
2395856	2395956	yet.
2395996	2402660	But, you know, if it's coming out in Japan, they're going to translate it, so... Well, I mean, they didn't really translate Owen Don.
2402700	2405082	They kind of gave us a whole new version that was, I think, better.
2405262	2407123	But, you know, depends what kind of music you're into.
2407503	2409064	Anyway, Eddie is dying over here.
2409124	2411666	He wants to share some Wii news that wasn't on our show roll.
2413107	2416669	Yeah, there's an unconfirmed rumor on the internet, which is always reliable...
2417079	2423081	The Nintendo's going to come out with sensor ankle straps so you can kick and dance and kick.
2424261	2425901	That's a bunch of bullshit.
2426021	2426982	I think that'd be awesome.
2427162	2429622	Even if it's not true, if it was true, that'd be awesome.
2429642	2430342	That'd be so cool.
2431783	2433463	Can anybody say Sega Activator?
2434924	2436004	Sega Activator.
2436204	2436864	That's pretty easy.
2438244	2438945	I think that'd be cool.
2439005	2439585	I don't know.
2439885	2442446	You could run and jump and do it.
2443626	2444046	And do it.
2446209	2448230	SSJ100 Matt in chat says that's fake.
2450312	2452453	Ooh, shot down.
2453734	2453874	Ouch.
2453894	2455235	They do have the penis sensor light.
2456736	2457176	Sweet.
2459097	2459698	Dead air.
2462159	2468643	I just wanted to point out, though, Loki, the Nintendo fanboy train is going by, and, you know, you're not on it.
2470724	2471925	Oh, sick burn, Rob.
2474047	2474347	Come on.
2475632	2477774	Come on, Loki, get on the Wii fanboy train.
2478274	2484540	Why don't we give him, like, a fucking, you know, soundboard, because we'd have stuff like this.
2486161	2489544	No, yeah, because, no, Loki actually is a Nintendo... He likes Nintendo.
2489584	2490845	I went over to his video game party.
2491205	2492506	It was, like, all Nintendo, pretty much.
2492586	2494068	I mean, so he's not against Nintendo.
2494388	2494888	Come on, now.
2495449	2497831	I'm picking up, you know, SSX Blur next week.
2498331	2499252	That's going to be awesome.
2499412	2500593	I'm really looking forward to that.
2501394	2502755	But, to be honest, you know...
2503752	2504613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2514478	2521620	Stop releasing old ass games under a new title because they're on the portable systems now and on the Wii.
2521900	2524441	It's just a port of some old game that was out before.
2524741	2526601	Listen, it didn't sell well the first time.
2526681	2529282	Stop trying to port it over to get some more sales out of it.
2529562	2533923	Especially, do we really need another port of Driver Parallel Lines?
2534183	2537704	I mean, wasn't it bad enough the first time and now you have to...
2538284	2539966	Enhance it with some better controls
2568207	2569267	It's so cool.
2571448	2579570	Why the fuck, okay, why the fuck is he posting that in his blog and the other thing is, why the fuck are people posting it in their blogs?
2579930	2582591	Like saying, dude, did you hear the guy from IGN?
2582911	2585931	He heard that there's news coming that's cool.
2586932	2588652	What the fuck is that?
2588812	2593053	Oh my god, you guys, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is coming to PartnerNet, but you didn't hear it from me.
2593293	2595174	That missed our show role too, you know?
2596254	2596694	Owl thing.
2597633	2601015	Even though we're not supposed to talk about it, dude, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is totally on PartnerNet.
2601175	2605977	Rob, is this like the same guy that was the t-shirt dude from two weeks ago?
2606617	2608058	Yeah, I think maybe.
2608158	2611019	Wow, that's pretty crazy because you do the voice exactly the same.
2611480	2613420	That's my uniformed straight male voice, actually.
2613681	2614641	Oh, wow, you do it really well.
2614721	2615021	Thank you.
2615201	2615641	You're welcome.
2616022	2619283	Dude, Rice Princess, give me a beer and make me a pie, bitch.
2619683	2625206	I'm going to say, you know, a lot of the stuff that's on PartnerNet that people go and report about, it's not really...
2625990	2629251	I saw that that Jetpack game that they've already announced is on PartnerNet.
2652501	2654082	Wow, you didn't announce the game.
2654122	2656022	You didn't give me any details about the game.
2656103	2659524	All you said is you're confirming something that they've already announced.
2660964	2662125	Wow, that's awesome.
2662365	2662925	Guess what?
2663085	2665406	WarioWare Smooth Moves, it's in stores now.
2665726	2668027	I just confirmed something that they've already announced.
2669728	2670768	Give me my own blog.
2672009	2674230	Joshi16 says, Attention, Loki.
2674290	2675530	It's all about attention.
2676971	2678291	Let's see, what else is there here?
2678952	2681173	NintendoManiac64 says, Breaking news.
2681213	2681973	There's news coming.
2683289	2685791	GS68 says, Loki, free speech, anyone?
2687352	2689234	Fine, but I don't have to listen to them.
2690435	2697320	Alright, well, anyhow, we should move on to another story here, and this is like this ongoing saga.
2697780	2704325	Like, I thought we would have talked about this once on the show, laughed, and it would be done with, and I'm talking about level 30.
2705366	2707608	And you know when I say level 30, I'm talking about Bubble Bobble DS.
2707808	2707968	Oh god.
2709301	2710042	BUBBLE BOBBLE REVOLUTION
2724175	2727596	You get a free copy of Rainbow Islands Revolution.
2727956	2731757	Because I didn't even know there was a Rainbow Islands Revolution.
2731777	2732497	I did in no way.
2732517	2735677	And I actually played the old school Rainbow Islands.
2735817	2737698	I still play it today on GameTap.
2738298	2740818	And I could care less that there's this DF version out.
2741079	2747040	And if I'm a Rainbow Islands fanboy and don't give a shit about this DS release, I can't imagine there's five people who bought this game.
2747440	2750681	Therefore, you're getting this free game because nobody else wanted it.
2751161	2752581	They have extra copies sitting in the warehouse.
2752621	2752761	So...
2753484	2755166	Does this atone for their sins?
2755846	2758789	It's all well with Codemasters now because they give you a free game.
2758829	2760451	I mean, you gotta say, they didn't have to do that.
2760691	2761532	Let me just put it this way.
2761572	2768418	They should really fire their marketing people because that cover for Bubble Revolution or whatever looks like crap.
2768498	2770600	I mean, those dinosaurs look really fucked up.
2770640	2773463	Jesus, did they gain like a thousand pounds or something?
2773543	2775425	Like Jenny Craig, anyone?
2775845	2777707	There's a nice little letter that came with it.
2778208	2778968	Thank you for watching!
2796915	2798916	Also for the Nintendo DS, so there's only one.
2799196	2799937	So, oh, great.
2800317	2800677	Oh, great.
2800957	2807340	So I got, you know, my Bubble Bobble wouldn't go to level 30, and now there's only one goddamn island in Rainbow Island.
2809381	2809882	Okay, wait.
2810662	2812543	We've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island.
2812883	2815324	You know why they included Rainbow Islands, right?
2815584	2815825	Why?
2816045	2818126	Because Bubble Bobble really only goes up to 31.
2819465	2821027	So they're like, oh, you're going to be done after 31.
2821187	2822628	People are going to believe you, Rice Princess.
2822648	2825131	Yeah, because I work for them.
2825511	2832998	Anyway, we've enclosed a free copy of Rainbow Island as consideration for the length of time that you had to wait for the new cartridges to be manufactured.
2833399	2841567	Please dispose of your faulty cartridge by simply putting it in the trash or local recycling facility where one exists.
2841877	2843298	You know why it's called Rainbow Island?
2843618	2847679	Because they didn't finish the rest of the levels and you're going to have to send it in to get the rest of them.
2847699	2850100	You know what you need to fucking do with that replacement cartridge?
2850921	2856523	Return it to your local GameStop and get some money back because they're not going to know the difference.
2856603	2856983	They got it.
2857163	2857604	Come on.
2858004	2859184	They're not dumb enough to buy it.
2859204	2859604	Yeah, they are.
2859624	2860725	There's got to be some way they can tell.
2861204	2861844	No, they're not.
2862124	2866146	Okay, fine, take it back to your local, whatever, used game store.
2866366	2875710	Alright, well, stories about Bubble Bobble Revolution going on four weeks in a row make me very angsty, and I don't know about you, but that makes me want to bring on the pain with the FUs of the week.
2885475	2894922	Loki, since DarkSakura is not here tonight, I will put in a preemptive DarkSakura FU to traffic and people and how she's busy with massage school and all that crap.
2895242	2896623	Alright, Loki, what's your FU tonight?
2897024	2903208	I don't really have an FU, but I'm going to take this moment to let everyone in on a huge secret.
2903849	2910554	There is some uber huge exciting news coming soon.
2911537	2916859	And I tell you, once you hear what this news is, it's going to fucking blow your mind.
2917579	2918819	It's so amazing.
2919820	2921140	I really wish I could tell you, but I can't.
2922100	2923141	You know, NDAs and all.
2925181	2929803	I like how they follow the NDAs when it comes to that news, but when it comes to everything else, you just kind of go, what NDA?
2929883	2931743	You know why?
2931763	2933224	Because there's no news.
2934684	2937445	This is the same guy that said there's fucking Halo on the Game Boy Advance.
2937465	2938225	I mean, come on.
2939106	2939846	Oh my god, there is?
2941320	2943301	Oh my god, burn your Gameboy or Ice Princess.
2943381	2947942	Oh, unsubscribe, unsubscribe.
2949202	2954304	I would like to give an F you to Whoppers, the original malted milk balls, because they are so addicting.
2954904	2959045	And I think my roommate did a bunch of them when I wasn't here, so F you to that.
2959305	2960846	Don't steal my Whoppers when I'm not here.
2961666	2963326	Give me my malted milk balls.
2966347	2968188	How dare you take my malted milk balls.
2968248	2968348	Eddie.
2968448	2968608	Eddie.
2969864	2976108	I'd like to say an F you to all the garbage that I've been keeping in my closet because I'm moving and I have to throw it away now and I'm like, ah!
2976128	2979069	Because it's taking forever and it's horribly bad.
2980270	2981611	F you, garbage in my closet!
2983912	2985013	What else do you have in your closet?
2985173	2985573	Nothing!
2985893	2986574	Rice Princess.
2986594	2988175	You already came out.
2989736	2997240	F you to the auction house on Elder Palace because you're stupid and you'd never have good leather headgear.
2998152	2999053	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3016437	3021160	But I call it, let's QQ more poo-poo, because it's funner to say, I don't know.
3021180	3022681	What does even pew-pew mean?
3023161	3023922	Like shooting?
3024222	3025163	Like pew-pew!
3025583	3027344	But what if you're a warrior, you don't really shoot?
3027384	3029986	Then punch yourself in the face, why the fuck are you playing a warrior?
3030606	3031306	Warriors are lame.
3031326	3033828	You should be playing a rogue or a hunter.
3033848	3034869	Anything else?
3035009	3036029	No, that's it.
3036330	3038831	Lanky style, do you have anything you wish to contribute?
3039291	3041553	F you the Taco Bell, because it makes more poo-poo.
3043014	3044315	Yeah, more poo-poo, less QQ.
3045706	3048749	In that case... Ew.
3049090	3049590	Ew, ew.
3052574	3058640	Speaking of things that are pretty poo-poo, in my opinion, Alien Hamed is coming to Xbox 360.
3059375	3061056	Sorry, I did not like Alien Hominid.
3084728	3086489	XBOX Live Talk to 1UP Wing Commander Arena
3111818	3115021	and nobody cares because it looks like shit.
3115921	3125789	I don't know if anyone's seen the videos out there, but the Wing Commander that you've known and loved or maybe didn't like, this is certainly not the same game.
3125849	3130252	In fact, this is as much Wing Commander as Novodrome was Twisted Metal.
3130412	3132434	So, I don't know.
3132494	3138178	But anyways, if you're interested, it's 16 players online and you can battle each other.
3138198	3138899	That might be cool.
3140205	3140825	No.
3140885	3141386	Well, come on.
3141426	3149651	I mean, even though the game did not look like Wing Commander, like if you've seen the little game preview, somebody took the Wing Commander license and put it on some, like, random space shooter game.
3149911	3151412	But 16 people, come on.
3151872	3152572	That's gotta be fun.
3152853	3154473	Was Novodrome fun with 16 people?
3154574	3156114	Novodrome, no, you're right.
3156194	3157595	Novodrome was just not a fun game at all.
3158096	3160437	Anyway, so, it is coming out.
3160517	3162318	It's gonna have, you know, up to 16 players.
3162338	3168042	They're gonna have free-for-all maps, duly maps, team maps, blah, blah, blah.
3168522	3168702	And...
3169713	3170694	Yeah, it's great.
3171515	3176879	There's videos online, YouTube, GameTrailers.com, so check it out and be disappointed.
3178300	3182824	Apparently Boom Boom Rocket is really anticipated by a lot of folks in chat room.
3183144	3183725	That looks fun.
3183745	3184405	It does look fun.
3185226	3192872	See, I like DDR, and I did like Fantavision, so... Our old buddy Mel B's in chat and says it's like Dance Mania Speed meets Fireworks.
3193213	3194214	That's what Boom Boom Rocket is.
3195455	3195935	I want to see a...
3197979	3198939	Video of that in motion.
3198959	3201140	We see screenshots, but screenshots only tell you so much.
3201300	3207202	You know, that would be kind of fun to play Def Jam Icon with Dance Mania Speed as the custom soundtrack in that.
3208723	3212404	Any game with Dance Mania Speed as the custom soundtrack is sure to be hilarity.
3214305	3216186	Something that's not funny is my Xbox 360.
3216586	3219287	It makes too damn much noise whenever I'm playing it.
3219467	3224909	And apparently, though, there is a rumor going around because, you know, when websites that are foreign...
3225396	3227757	Release News, which is the case of this German website.
3227977	3228817	It's only a rumor.
3229897	3233038	The US websites won't believe it until Microsoft announces it.
3233058	3233859	Because they can't read it.
3234079	3234539	Well, whatever.
3234859	3237340	But anyway, it certainly sounds like it could be a possibility.
3237740	3240441	A German gaming website, what was it called?
3241301	3243481	Cinemite.de or Cinemite, I don't know.
3244762	3255065	They announced that Microsoft has done a software update for debug Xbox 360s that reduces the speed of the DVD drive, causing the noise to go down.
3255711	3256833	But the drive is slower then.
3257914	3259957	Yeah, but did it need all the high speeds?
3260077	3260177	Yes.
3261229	3265331	Well, don't you think the update is smart enough to know, hey, when you need the high speed, use high speed.
3265592	3267193	When you don't need it, shut up.
3267453	3269714	Does anyone really care how loud the DVD drive is?
3269754	3273096	Because, to be honest, I don't really notice mine when I'm playing games.
3273236	3277759	And if you're sitting there going, damn, my drive is loud, then you're going to die.
3277879	3278519	I'm going to be honest.
3278599	3279260	I do notice it.
3279440	3280881	Especially when you boot the system.
3280941	3283882	Like, when you boot and you're starting a game, that's when I really notice it.
3283902	3286544	I'm like, god damn, is my Xbox 360 going to launch into space?
3286904	3288085	Because it makes so much noise.
3288145	3289806	It's like...
3293080	3295541	Don't you think they make up... Maybe it's just because mine's vertical standing?
3295621	3295941	I don't know.
3296221	3300023	I think because yours is on a hard surface, and so it transfers the sound.
3300583	3310948	But, I mean, if you put it on carpet, like I have mine right now, I was playing on my monitor on my computer, and so I have it sitting on next to my normal PC, and I don't really hear it.
3311108	3313129	I mean, I don't know.
3313189	3317971	But then again, I have headphones on, and I'm listening to the music and stuff, so... But...
3319315	3320255	Whatever, I don't know.
3320535	3321556	It's not a big deal for me.
3321576	3328858	I mean, if it was like, like the whole time when you're playing it, then that would be a little different, but... That would just be really weird if they did that.
3328878	3331799	It's not the millions of unsubscribed clicks you were getting throughout the world.
3331839	3333839	I mean, so it's not a huge deal, though.
3334099	3336860	It's not like a chainsaw sound or something like that.
3337780	3338140	I don't know.
3338801	3340421	People just need to quit bitching.
3341141	3346603	SpeedyF40, OuchEars, GS68, LokiWTF, AlphaCanogram, DamnLoki...
3349523	3350524	Loki needs a sedative.
3351044	3364536	I was going to say, Eddie was making fun of me calling my wireless headset a wireless communicator at one point, but I wanted to say during my gaming week, I bought one of those $20 things that you can put in your computer, what's it called, the gaming receiver or something like that, so you can use your wireless headset.
3364816	3370902	It's awesome, because I can use my wireless headset on Ventrilo, and I didn't have to do any configuration on my computer.
3371202	3375466	Ventrilo just automatically knew, and the voices come through on the ear, and you can talk.
3375806	3376326	with the headset.
3376346	3376926	It's great.
3376986	3379347	We should just buy a bunch of those and all do the show with that.
3379367	3380267	Yeah, just do the show with that.
3380287	3384708	You know, it's too bad, Rob, because the Ventrilo server doesn't work anymore, so you never go on.
3384788	3390550	And Rob puts on a red mini Uhura skirt and goes, all hailing frequencies open, Captain, for lovin'.
3391190	3392591	Nobody even understands that.
3393191	3394591	It's from Star Trek.
3394691	3404774	Thousands of listeners of Warren's, I'm sorry, hundreds of listeners after tonight, actually maybe 20 listeners of Warren's on radio after tonight, and not a one of them is going to understand that at all.
3404814	3405034	Very well.
3407821	3414009	Anywho, one thing that's never quieting down is these stupid rumors about Metal Gear Solid 4 on the 360.
3415552	3420018	And yet another one fanning the flames of this rumor.
3420679	3421900	There's apparently a...
3422622	3423402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3452205	3455287	and also on this survey, do you like candy?
3455987	3457147	Do you like money?
3457368	3462950	Because as Captain Obvious' survey, of course people want to see Metal Gear Solid on the 360, right?
3463110	3464471	I mean, the more games, the better?
3465051	3466052	Lanky Star, you're shaking your head.
3466092	3466372	Why not?
3468213	3470214	Because I hate the Xbox 360.
3470314	3472075	That's a great reason.
3472135	3473115	Why do you hate the 360?
3473195	3474376	I don't hate it.
3474476	3479078	I don't hate it, but it's not as good as like a DS or a Wii.
3479218	3479478	Why?
3479758	3480099	Reasons?
3480339	3480659	Titles.
3481496	3482136	That's what matters.
3482776	3485097	360 has got a lot of shit coming out.
3485697	3486478	I mean, I don't know.
3486498	3489499	A lot of it's good, you know, exclusive titles.
3489539	3490299	Boom Boom Rocket.
3491519	3493720	Is it like Boom Boom Fire?
3493800	3494280	Boom Boom Dollar?
3494480	3500582	No, I'm going to get one only for the Mistwalker titles because I'm a big OG Final Fantasy fanboy.
3500622	3501502	Blue Dragon.
3501562	3501822	Yes.
3502042	3503063	Blue fucking Dragon.
3503083	3505163	Blue Dragon looks awesome and so does Lost Odyssey.
3507924	3510245	Lost Odyssey's a ways off.
3511295	3514337	It's not... Hopefully it won't be a lost cause.
3516598	3523081	No, but anyways, this comes from apparently an Evil Avatar forum post, so... Take that as rumor, I guess.
3523541	3530205	To be honest, I don't believe that such survey exists, but, you know... Evil Avatar's another all-game show, so we gotta show a little love.
3530225	3532126	I'm just saying, but this is like a listener.
3532186	3537589	This isn't exactly, you know... But, whatever, I mean... It's possible that they're...
3538507	3541788	Do they really need to ask people what their interest is in Metal Gear Solid 4?
3541828	3545148	I mean, that's like, would you like to see Halo 3?
3546749	3549009	I mean, it's dumb.
3550050	3553930	Shadowslayer says, my god, a survey, amazing, it's confirmed.
3555171	3557151	I think that was a little bit of sarcasm there.
3557491	3564753	Speaking of obvious, it sounds like Crackdown 2 has already been greenlit, and that gets a big fat duh as well.
3565453	3565553	Um...
3566587	3569069	I mean, maybe it'll contain the Halo 4 beta.
3569890	3570790	That was the joke.
3571051	3572151	Yeah, I read that joke.
3572191	3574914	Yeah, I stole a joke from whatever the site, QJ or whatever.
3575214	3577696	But I mean, come on, it doesn't take a lot of brains to come up with that joke.
3578156	3580818	Isn't that the only reason why Crackdown's really selling the Halo 3 beta?
3581098	3584421	I think a lot of people are actually buying it for the game because it's a fun game.
3585622	3586603	It's a lot of fun.
3587083	3593008	And I mean, if it were just for the Halo 3 beta, then you wouldn't see a lot of people playing the game right now because...
3593522	3594643	Halo 3 Beta isn't out.
3610536	3612657	A more believable functioning city.
3613197	3614477	The city makes the fun.
3614878	3619119	I think it comes to how you choose and approach your missions and so on and so on.
3619219	3632123	Well, the thing is about Crackdown and they even were talking about when they were designing the game originally, they've made it to where they can add islands and add whole extra parts of the city that aren't in the full game right now later on.
3632323	3636445	So this game can expand almost as much as like Oblivion can.
3636925	3637265	So...
3638651	3639732	I hope they go that route.
3639872	3640572	That'd be really cool.
3641052	3642953	Chatroom is shooting down the whole Halo.
3643213	3644613	I stand corrected, apparently.
3644673	3646614	DDRDollarBill says, I liked Crackdown.
3646674	3647594	Fuck Halo 3 Beta.
3648075	3650415	JeremyTodd1 says, I could care less about the Halo 3 Beta.
3650455	3651696	Crackdown is amazing as a game.
3652316	3656498	And DDRDollarBill confirms again, Crackdown is more fun than fucking Halo.
3656798	3657618	I mean, don't get me wrong.
3657698	3663060	I'm going to play the Halo 3 Beta because I'm going to be able to play the Halo 3 Beta, but...
3664335	3664815	I don't know.
3664855	3666176	I'm not too excited about it.
3666296	3675561	I think it's just going to be... Everyone's going to be, I think, disappointed because there's been a lot of people who have done it really good so far and there's not really much you can innovate on.
3676522	3681925	And this, you know, big secret X button crap or whatever that is, I don't think it's going to be that big deal.
3682505	3683526	So, whatever.
3684106	3684627	We shall see.
3684947	3685187	Anyways.
3686241	3702230	So another thing that's going to be shown pretty soon is going to be Xbox 360's IPTV service, and they're actually showing it at the Connected Home show at, well, in Europe, of course, a brand new show down there.
3702951	3711756	And it looks interesting, not really too much, you know, they don't really go into any details on it, but I guess it's going to have DVR stuff in there as well.
3712556	3714717	Anything that can give me more TV channels, I'm all for.
3714737	3715878	So, you know,
3716755	3717776	I can't wait to check this out.
3719438	3719658	All right.
3735153	3738214	I'm curious about it, but I don't like the fact that you have to switch everything to do it.
3738314	3741956	I'm not going to switch everything just to have TV on my 360, you know what I mean?
3742296	3749138	Apparently it's going to be taking place, though, the Connected Home Show, and that's March 5th through 7th in Olympia, London.
3749718	3751919	I'd like to see some YouTubage of it in motion.
3751939	3754620	I don't know.
3754700	3759102	Anyhow, something else very cool announced to the Xbox 360, price cuts for the games!
3759202	3759822	Yay!
3759942	3761182	Actually, not all the games.
3761262	3762923	It's the Platinum Hit series, but you know.
3763328	3764412	We all like news on a price cut.
3764513	3766520	And actually, a lot of those are already price cut.
3766721	3768025	Have already been price cut, huh?
3768046	3769350	Yeah, they just don't have the new packaging.
3769690	3775795	Well, supposedly March 16th is the day that the new packaging will come out, but it sounds like a lot of retailers have been proactive about the price.
3775835	3777136	Yeah, they've already dropped the pricing.
3777216	3793549	Well, for the low, low price of $30, you can get Battlefield 2, Burnout Revenge, Call of Duty 2, Dead or Alive 4, Fight Night Round 3, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, Top Spin 2, or Rockstar Games Table Tennis, which I seem to recall only cost $39 in the first place.
3793789	3794029	Yeah.
3794049	3795250	So it's not much of a price cut.
3796231	3797532	And Top Spin 2 sucks balls.
3797552	3797972	Don't buy it.
3798573	3799693	Call of Duty 2, Battlefield, etc.
3821520	3824502	Burnout, but Chromehounds as well and Perfect Dark Zero.
3824962	3829745	And other regions in Asia also get 99 nights, which should be interesting.
3830285	3833927	Chromehounds, I do believe, has already dropped down in price in the United States as well.
3834968	3835688	So, I mean...
3836621	3844743	You can probably find that if you really... But keep in mind, if you want to have the best tanks in the game or whatever, the best mechs, whatever you call them, you have to buy extra stuff online.
3844803	3849785	Just wait for Armored Core 4 because this is the game that you should have bought in the first place anyways.
3850665	3855086	I was a sucker, also bought Chromehounds thinking, oh, it's going to be just like Armored Core.
3855306	3858567	It's like Armored Core with anchors being dragged behind you.
3858627	3862968	It's so slow and boring.
3863268	3864209	Armored Core 4 is the way to go.
3865109	3865369	Anyways...
3866474	3867755	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3886863	3887844	It's like a big duh.
3888124	3889605	So that game is going to be coming out.
3889665	3893147	Mercenaries, if you don't remember, originally I believe was put out by LucasArts.
3893868	3897190	And it was one of those games that you can... I remember the commercial actually for it.
3897510	3902454	They're all, you know, shoot people, blow stuff up again, you know.
3902734	3907557	It's kind of one of those sandbox type of games where you can just cause a lot of mayhem.
3907697	3910359	So I will definitely be checking it out.
3913001	3914382	And it's set for fall, by the way.
3915704	3920166	A game that I will definitely check out is Elder Scrolls V, because you know there's going to be one on the way.
3921046	3924547	And Elder Scrolls IV was obviously an amazing game.
3925668	3929109	Bethesda has confirmed Elder Scrolls V will happen.
3929229	3930150	It's definitely going to happen.
3930190	3935672	There's no immediate plans right now, according to the studio's vice president of PR and marketing, Pete Hines.
3936432	3944575	But what else is interesting is that he says the possibility of an MMO is kind of a natural step for the series.
3945633	3946854	Um, very interesting.
3947495	3955840	Uh, but what's interesting about that, uh, it's been bounced around, according to Heinz, but, uh, they will not move forward with it unless there's a fresh idea for the MMO genre.
3956121	3962125	But, dude, I think opening up Oblivion as an MMO would, you know, or that type of game as an MMO is good enough, don't you think?
3962785	3966708	I mean, God, when that multiplayer patch hit, most people were like, this should have just been in the game to begin with.
3967288	3968229	It's gonna be crazy, though.
3968930	3969730	It'll be interesting.
3971131	3972352	I don't know, I can't wait.
3973008	3978034	But you know you're not going to see this game until 2009 at the earliest.
3978454	3985282	I mean, it's going to be when people are talking about PlayStation 4 and Xbox 720, whenever that happens.
3985903	3987324	Or whatever the fuck else they're going to call it.
3987525	3987985	Yeah, we'll see.
3989066	3989427	Anyways...
3990412	3996717	So, with Clover being dissolved, some of the members, of course, went on to create the brand new company, Seed.
3997157	4001300	The other members stuck around and are now working for Capcom.
4001400	4002401	Well, what are they working on?
4003162	4009606	You're going to be seeing them working on Resident Evil 5, for one, and, of course, a brand new Wii game, as well.
4010127	4016191	So, it's kind of nice to see Clover, because I know they were doing a lot of original IPs and stuff, and kind of
4017106	4020567	Throwing that kind of creative side to Resident Evil 5.
4021528	4023309	Hopefully this Wii game, that's pretty awesome.
4023329	4026490	It's pretty sweet.
4027770	4028130	Interesting.
4028631	4032372	So I guess Clover, not as far gone as some people think.
4032392	4043777	Well, they're gone, but it's like if you buy a company or something like that, a lot of times you'll dissolve the company and just say, okay, whoever wants to move over, we'll pay you to move over.
4044177	4044777	Otherwise...
4045936	4046637	Find a new job.
4047037	4047757	It's kind of like that.
4047777	4055903	You pretty much keep the same people, but... Yeah, you get the talent, but you don't have to pay for the spot, the lease or whatever.
4056324	4057585	You're just cutting costs that way.
4058165	4065330	Well, that was the last story we had paid for Part A, but we're actually running a little early tonight, so I think we'll actually go to the Skype line and take some calls.
4065470	4068413	I covertly opened up the Skype line there and saw if we'd get any calls.
4069053	4071755	So we'll get some calls out of the way early a little bit tonight, because we're running early tonight.
4072436	4073817	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4073837	4074157	Who's this?
4074844	4075464	How you doing, Sky?
4075484	4076265	I'm SpeedyF40.
4076605	4077705	Hi, SpeedyF40.
4078366	4079246	I don't recognize the name.
4079266	4080086	You must be a new listener.
4081107	4086089	I'm not a new listener because I've been listening to the podcast forever.
4086709	4087189	Awesome.
4087810	4088710	Brand new on the stream, though.
4089290	4089871	Well, welcome.
4089971	4091011	Welcome to the first show.
4091211	4091972	I guess live show.
4092072	4093252	Is this the first live show you're doing, then?
4093772	4094973	Yeah, first live show I'm doing.
4095053	4097654	I've popped my Orange Lounge cherry tonight.
4098554	4099075	Sweet.
4099315	4100395	Congratulations.
4100875	4101316	Yeah.
4101436	4101996	Was it hot?
4102336	4104257	Was it as good for you as it was for me?
4105061	4109745	I'm sure it was probably better for you because I tried harder, but I'm sure it worked out for everybody.
4110646	4111927	Speedy, what kind of games are you into?
4112668	4121675	Well, right now I'm playing Star Wars Deadly Alliance or something for the PSP because I got it through Gamefly and it's mildly entertaining.
4122055	4128241	But I'm playing some WoW and some Wii games, even though I got a topic for you.
4128441	4129061	Alright, what's up?
4129982	4131103	I think the Wii is overrated.
4132010	4134371	Oh, Gasp, you're on Loki's side tonight.
4135071	4138332	So you are not on the train tonight with everybody else.
4138932	4140532	You're not on the Wii fanboy train.
4140972	4145193	Yeah, I... Oh, God.
4146174	4146614	Just kidding.
4146634	4148074	Yeah, I'm not on the fanboy train.
4148214	4151415	I think that the Wii is completely overrated because...
4152364	4155645	Okay, I think it's just more of a party system, a fad system, if you will.
4155745	4160847	I have a Wii, I bought it the day it came out, and I'm missing my gaming experience.
4160887	4162687	I've been going to the PC more and more often.
4164428	4167889	But, Ian, what's interesting, do you think the Wii is going the way of the GameCube?
4167909	4171830	Because I even, I love Nintendo, I would have paid the GameCube very similarly.
4171930	4176192	Although you had some phenomenal games on GameCube, you know, Resident Evil 4, it was mostly a party system.
4176612	4178112	Your Mario Parties, your Smash Bros.
4178132	4180273	Melees, you know, it was a party system.
4180876	4188840	I don't think it'll go the way of the GameCube because it has that quirkiness and it has games like, oh gosh, Warriorware, which is a really fun game.
4189120	4190981	Definitely kudos to them for doing that one.
4191581	4196264	But I think that a serious gamer would be better off with the Xbox 360.
4197044	4206069	So you don't think the uber-cool Metroid or, no, no, the uber-cool super-secret thing the IGN guy won't shut up about, you don't think that's going to change your mind?
4206809	4210531	No, I don't think a DVD drive or anything like that is going to change my mind at all.
4211420	4221143	See, I totally disagree, because on the Twilight Princess, I think that was a perfect marriage of classic, sort of old-school styling with combining some of the wee elements to make it more immersive.
4221683	4222723	Oh, give me a break.
4222763	4224044	Twilight Princess sucked.
4224084	4225484	It was not as good as it could have been.
4225584	4228265	It was developed for the GameCube, and it showed.
4228605	4229345	Definitely showed.
4229365	4235047	Yeah, but I think it showed that it can do a classic-style game and still be awesome.
4235678	4238260	It could do a classic style game when it's a freaking port.
4238360	4246888	I think that Twilight Princess was entertaining because it was Zelda, but I don't think it was any better than any other platformer could have been.
4247168	4248629	There was no huge breakthrough.
4249550	4252472	You know, our chat room, very polarized on the same topic.
4252512	4254574	Jvmon says Twilight Princess was overrated.
4254874	4257276	ShadowNextGen says, I love Twilight Princess.
4258357	4261680	Jvmon also says, Twilight Princess showed fanboys will love anything.
4262080	4262501	You know what?
4262661	4263822	I like Wind Waker a lot better.
4264578	4265299	What?
4265339	4266260	You're smoking crack!
4283485	4291411	I was like, well, why the fuck did they just not make it like a remake of, you know, Link to the Past or something like that with that kind of style of graphics?
4291431	4294954	This coming from the person who was criticizing Nintendo early in the show for doing too damn many remakes.
4296142	4296422	Huh?
4296742	4297022	Okay.
4297302	4297702	Pwned!
4298022	4299103	No, here's what I'm saying, though.
4299203	4305704	I don't necessarily want them to do an actual remake, but I just wanted it to actually be in Hyrule instead of in the ocean.
4305804	4309865	I mean, because I would have rather had, you know, more land and stuff like that and run around like that.
4310425	4311565	I don't mind the art style.
4311585	4312826	I thought it was kind of different.
4312866	4315446	You know, you got used to it, and it kind of worked.
4315906	4323148	It's just... And then, now I'm playing, you know, Twilight Princess, and I lost interest in like an hour, so...
4324648	4325329	Same here, Loki.
4325409	4325970	Same here.
4326030	4326531	I don't get it.
4326691	4328213	I don't get why everyone brings us a 10.
4328394	4329435	It wasn't that great.
4329455	4330637	Did you play through the whole game, though?
4331218	4331859	Twilight Princess?
4331879	4332059	Yeah.
4332811	4336132	No, I... Well, if the game sucks, Eddie, you're not going to play through it.
4336212	4340333	No, yeah, no, the first... I mean, the story doesn't really start developing right away, though.
4340353	4344953	I mean, once you get into it, I mean, it's like... It's the first... To me, it's the only true sequel to Ocarina of Time.
4345294	4347394	I mean, once you get into it, like, it's really cool.
4347414	4349634	They start touching base with all the old Ocarina of Time stuff.
4349654	4351415	I didn't even care about Ocarina of Time, though.
4351455	4351935	See, that's a thing.
4352075	4352435	Oh, wow.
4352475	4353575	See, you're not even a Zelda fan, then.
4353635	4358336	All right, well, the beautiful part of Orange Lounge Radio is that everybody is entitled to their own opinion, even when they're wrong.
4359596	4359996	Exactly.
4360277	4362497	All right, well, Speedy, anything else you want to share with us tonight?
4363143	4366846	DarkSakura had family obligations tonight, so you get the fuzzy gay man instead.
4392276	4392776	and Rice Princess.
4392796	4393636	Whatever, I'll deal.
4393656	4394256	Alright, yeah, you'll deal.
4394497	4398578	No, actually, but DarkSakura is going to be in a tape segment next, so you will get some DarkSakura love in this show.
4398998	4399398	Oh, good.
4399698	4401198	I'd love to meet some DarkSakura.
4401218	4404739	Wait, at WC Radio, aren't all your shows, like, dominating Dig right now?
4405319	4406579	Yeah, we started a few.
4406599	4406819	You suck.
4406839	4408100	You're outranking us right now.
4408680	4409320	Oh, God.
4409640	4409940	You know what?
4409960	4411180	Go dig Orange Launch Radio.
4411601	4413301	They got everybody started with podcasts.
4413401	4414001	It's all good.
4414221	4415942	WC Radio's an independent thing, right?
4416402	4417202	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
4417602	4418522	I'm all for it.
4418802	4419402	I'm all for it.
4419763	4420743	Indie radio all the way.
4421083	4421623	Awesome.
4422139	4424419	Well, you're over there, you know, go check out WC Radio stuff.
4424459	4428560	But really, big Orange Lounge Radio, because give them justice, guys, seriously.
4428580	4431881	This is a fan saying this, a hardcore OLI fan.
4432701	4434281	Oh, I should just let this guy talk forever.
4434341	4435281	He's like inflating my ego.
4435301	4436762	I'm not even going to be able to get out the door.
4437822	4441402	Oh, yeah, no, but really, I do love the show, and I don't want to get all mushy on air.
4441462	4442603	But keep up the good work.
4442623	4443203	I'll be listening.
4443363	4443643	No, it's okay.
4443663	4444343	You can get a little mushy.
4444363	4444643	It's fine.
4444983	4445383	All right, no.
4445623	4447244	We appreciate the call, of course, Speedy.
4447824	4449724	Have a great day, even if you do hate the Wii, okay?
4450382	4451583	Okay, I don't hate the Wii.
4451723	4452583	Alright, I know, I know.
4452623	4454464	It's like the DS was when it first came out.
4454484	4457485	There's a lot of games that was like, eh, who gives a shit, you know?
4457505	4458506	Nintendo got them right.
4459306	4460066	It was like a fad.
4460246	4461967	Yeah, I know, but you know, it's a third party.
4462167	4465389	I'll agree, the third party games on the Wii do kind of suck, but... Just give it time, it'll be good.
4465689	4470111	EA, I think EA's got their game right now, so... He doesn't like the Wii?
4470731	4471811	Dude!
4471831	4473372	Welcome to five minutes ago.
4473472	4474713	Don't walk out of the room, ever.
4474773	4475033	Alright.
4475433	4479735	Anyway, Speedy, we gotta go take other calls, but thanks so much for your call and best of luck with WC Radio.
4480376	4481157	Okay, thank you very much.
4481177	4483078	I tell everybody at WC Radio we said hey.
4483639	4484319	Okay, hey.
4484479	4484760	Hey.
4484960	4485600	Alright.
4486361	4486681	Bye-bye.
4487021	4488843	Or like on Facebook, you poke them.
4489724	4492846	We're sending WC Radio a poke right now.
4493026	4493787	We'll send them a poke.
4494688	4495828	Goddammit, Eddie, give it to me.
4496369	4496929	Okay, or don't.
4497390	4498991	Ew, that sounded terrible.
4499011	4499972	Okay, not like that.
4500892	4501133	Ew.
4501153	4502954	Ew, fish.
4503194	4506637	Yeah, Facebook is weird because weird random people are adding me now.
4506657	4508178	I'm like, I don't go to Skolody or anything.
4508198	4508739	Who the fuck are you?
4510607	4515749	Well, WC, not WC Radio, maybe they're on Facebook, but Orange Launch Radio is also on Facebook.
4515789	4516710	I should give that a plug.
4517050	4517850	Search for OL Army.
4518330	4518870	We have another call.
4518910	4519671	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4519691	4519951	Who's this?
4520851	4523492	Hi, this is Alex Kidd from a former Sega fame.
4523532	4524032	How you doing?
4524233	4525113	Hi, Alex Kidd.
4525893	4527454	Wow, I'm really sorry to hear about your career.
4527494	4528194	Whatever happened to you?
4529095	4532236	Well, I retired in 1990, and rather, I didn't retire.
4532256	4533656	I got fired by Sega.
4533696	4536157	They wanted to bring in that stupid fucking rodent, Sonic.
4536718	4537778	I think you're all familiar with him.
4538038	4538358	Yeah?
4538798	4540119	Are you bitter at all about that?
4540715	4542657	No, because here's what I think.
4543217	4549221	I think he's only had one good game in the past five years, so I think it's high time that Sega brings me back.
4549442	4552144	They're bringing back all the classic stuff with Nintendo.
4552324	4553184	Why don't they bring me back?
4553264	4554465	Have you written Sega?
4554685	4558228	Have you talked to your people to talk to Sega's people about making a classic come back?
4558869	4565914	I've been writing them for years, and I had a restraining order like six years ago, but that's expired now.
4565934	4566454	What the hell did you do?
4566474	4568075	Did you send Shinobi World after them?
4568115	4568936	I mean, what the hell happened?
4569993	4578879	I don't know, like, Shinobi World was like the last thing I ever did, and then they just threw this hedgehog at me, and I couldn't compete.
4578899	4586284	Well, DM it, or, I mean, Alex Kidd, you certainly don't know how to play this game, do you?
4586324	4587104	I'm really bad at this game.
4587425	4590947	Alex Kidd, you didn't have blast processing.
4592364	4600810	No, but I mean, look, I could go on the 360 and sell 10 times more copies, which would be 10 copies of the Sonic the Hedgehog game.
4602731	4607355	Alright, well, Alex Kidd, is there a way we would see you on a virtual console at some point?
4608715	4609556	I don't know.
4610637	4611197	I'd like to.
4611978	4619643	I started writing to Nintendo and I started telling them, you know, bring back those Master System games because nobody played them because your system kicked our system's ass.
4620083	4620784	What happened there?
4621805	4623006	Why didn't you go to Nintendo?
4623026	4626089	If that's where you're feeling the love, Alex, why didn't you go over to Nintendo?
4626669	4632314	You know, at the time, it was Hiroshi Yamauchi, and he gave me the finger.
4633875	4638379	Don't you mean he gave you rock, and you had scissors?
4638399	4640300	Shut up.
4643038	4646481	I mean, seriously, Alex, that was the worst part of your fucking game.
4646741	4649364	Who thought of putting rock, paper, scissors in a video game?
4649764	4653567	Hey, I'm going to spend money on a video game so I can play rock, paper, scissors.
4654468	4656130	Did you ever fucking play Tecmo Bowl?
4656150	4657531	It's the same fucking thing.
4657871	4659152	It's fucking rock, paper, scissors.
4659192	4660593	Alex, kid, you got a dirty mouth.
4661214	4662395	I'm going to wash your mouth.
4662415	4662875	You know what?
4662895	4663396	Fuck this.
4663416	4664957	I'm giving it back to my buddy, DMN.
4664997	4665298	Hold on.
4665658	4667840	Hey, big jerk.
4671542	4673723	I have a multiple personality disorder live on the air.
4677006	4679848	Sorry about that, guys.
4679868	4682569	Hey, you kind of look like Alex Kidd without glasses.
4682669	4683230	It's amazing.
4684230	4685151	What's on your mind, DMN?
4686272	4686632	Nothing.
4687132	4688733	Alex Kidd came over and wanted a call.
4688813	4689734	It was frightening.
4689954	4691035	Oh, so I can hang up on you then?
4691515	4694457	No, because I actually have a guest announcement for STFU next week.
4694737	4698380	Alright, who's on STFU Thursday nights here on OLR?
4698400	4699600	Your buddy Loki, actually.
4699901	4700221	Really?
4700241	4700321	Yeah.
4700643	4700843	What?
4700863	4701143	What?
4730936	4731497	Who said that?
4731597	4731997	Wait, wait, wait.
4732017	4732517	Who said that?
4732777	4733257	Funny Dale.
4733718	4734698	Okay, hold on a second here.
4734878	4736939	No kicking Funny Dale because you disagree with him.
4738260	4738460	Huh?
4738880	4740681	No kicking Funny Dale because you disagree with him.
4741722	4742622	Oh, okay.
4743262	4746724	TheRobD says, I believe Derek H. said he's too straight to listen to OLR.
4748825	4749165	Whatever.
4752167	4756669	If you don't know what we're talking about, it's a reference to one of our sister programs, All Games Interactive.
4757571	4759752	Brother, Sister, Inbred Cousin, whatever you want to say.
4759952	4761673	I'm too straight to listen to that one line.
4762133	4763173	DMN, any quick thoughts?
4763193	4764634	We're going to take one more call before we take a break here.
4766395	4768956	You should play Luminous Live because it's pretty fun and it's $20.
4770656	4773498	But I have Luminous... Not Luminous Live, sorry, Luminous Plus.
4774078	4775498	I have Luminous on Xbox 360.
4775598	4775999	I don't need it.
4776579	4777139	Luminous Plus, $20.
4777199	4779460	That's $20 you ever spend.
4779540	4780740	You're wrong, but have a nice day anyway.
4780961	4781781	You're wrong, shut up.
4782241	4784522	I love hanging up on him.
4784822	4785262	One more call.
4786283	4786803	We'll go over here.
4788140	4789842	Whoa, hello to you too.
4790142	4790942	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4790962	4791303	Who's this?
4792063	4792984	Hey, it's Seisho.
4793325	4794185	Hi, Seisho.
4794205	4795046	What's on your mind, buddy?
4795867	4798249	I finally got Final Fantasy XII.
4798509	4800130	Rice Princess is cheering over here.
4800210	4802232	Yay, nice British guy.
4803834	4806576	That's right, Final Fantasy XII finally made its way to the UK shores this week.
4807677	4811120	And thank you for not spoiling it because it's fucking epic.
4811865	4813586	It is fucking epic in every sense of the word.
4813606	4816988	You've probably actually played more of it than I have because my friend stole it.
4817049	4819210	One of my friends will only play Final Fantasy games.
4819230	4820050	It's the only games he'll play.
4820251	4822352	And he took my PlayStation 2 when Final Fantasy XII came out.
4823473	4825114	I should beat him up for that.
4825474	4825754	All right.
4825794	4832778	Well, you've got to take a moment to sell the listeners who feel that Orange Lounge Radio is too gay for their tastes.
4833319	4835020	Then Final Fantasy XII probably is too.
4835340	4838182	So sell our listeners on Final Fantasy XII if you would.
4841289	4866890	um get it because it's like epic and if you play Final Fantasy XI you'll love it because it's just fucking it's Final Fantasy XI but with an actual story I guess RisePrincess made a face because she hates Final Fantasy XI I hate XI but I love XII and there's a bunny lady named Fran and she's hot and she's wearing a thong and you can look at her butt so that's why you should play the game
4868002	4872265	Mori in our chatroom says, fucking epic is now my new phrase of the week.
4872345	4874527	Like everybody, that's today's secret word.
4874787	4879691	Every time you hear the secret word, scream it out loud.
4880492	4883734	Alright, so that's all you've been playing is Final Fantasy XII non-stop?
4884555	4884935	Pretty much.
4885035	4887197	How was the cosplay over there when the game came out?
4887217	4890159	Did you go to one of those midnight parties with the cosplay and all that stuff?
4891460	4895883	I went to my local Azdra at midnight and there was like two people queuing up for it and that was it.
4896463	4897104	I was quite shocked.
4897699	4898239	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4919643	4922684	Supernova?
4923785	4928188	Dancing Stage Supernova, because heaven forbid I say revolution in a British territory.
4929308	4931529	Oh, that's... I don't know.
4932130	4934971	Well, why else don't they call it Dance Dance Revolution over there?
4935412	4935892	I don't know.
4936932	4937233	Anyhow.
4938213	4940915	They have a completely different song list, right?
4943016	4944577	Did they call it Dance Dance Revolution on PlayStation 1?
4945518	4947099	Yeah, I got first mix.
4947919	4949900	Well, don't you get it in two weeks?
4949940	4951100	It's really close to coming out, isn't it?
4952381	4955922	I think so, but I don't know if that's a real release date.
4957243	4962665	We're getting DDR Universe next week, and I'm pretty excited about that.
4963145	4964525	Yeah, I'm very excited about DDR Universe.
4965686	4969247	Dancing Stage Universe should be making its way over there soon enough, I imagine.
4970147	4973869	All right, well, Stacia, we've got to end our Part A here and get into Part B, but thanks so much for your call.
4973889	4974249	All right, buddy?
4975089	4975389	All right.
4976069	4976589	See you next week.
4976629	4977249	Take care, my friends.
4977289	4978310	Bye, sexy face.
4980710	4982630	You make your flirting so obvious, Rice Princess.
4982650	4984291	Did you add Rice Princess on MySpace yet?
4984911	4985371	Yes, I did.
4986111	4988151	Are you guys corresponding at all?
4988271	4988651	Maybe.
4988671	4989551	It's in your business.
4989872	4990172	Okay.
4990352	4990652	All right.
4990752	4991172	I'll back up.
4991672	4993252	More to come next week's episode.
4993592	4993892	All right.
4994132	4994732	Take care, Sesha.
4995532	4995833	See you.
4995853	4996233	Bye.
4996433	4996673	All right.
4996953	4998633	If you didn't get through right now, don't worry.
4998653	5004234	The phone lines will be open again in Part B, so please don't get your panties in a bunch that you did not make it onto the show.
5004819	5007681	because the phone lines will be open again in Part B. We just had a little extra time.
5008362	5010643	We want to make this part an hour and a half, so there you have it.
5010963	5011444	Some phone calls.
5011804	5017768	But we are going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to be back with Part B. DarkSakura is going to be here in pre-taped form.
5018148	5021691	Also, Beat the Host, one of our favorite OLR games.
5021711	5023352	We're going to be beating Rob in the ass.
5023412	5026154	And actually, I'm glad LankyStyle is here because he'd probably be better at it.
5026194	5026994	He would be good.
5027034	5028975	How do you feel about classic arcade games?
5029015	5029976	That's this week's topic.
5030597	5031137	I feel good.
5031570	5034492	Yeah, so I think, honestly, if you guys want a challenge tonight, Lanky Styles works out.
5034532	5035073	I knew that he would.
5035213	5041497	If you want to make fun of one of the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, Rice Princess would be a good one to pick on, because she'll bomb it.
5041798	5042318	She'll get one.
5042658	5043619	She eats rice.
5043879	5049183	All right, and I will tell you how you can be the listener that battles them very soon, a little bit later on.
5049503	5050424	But for now, we're going to take a break.
5050464	5052766	We'll be back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B.
5053906	5063662	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
