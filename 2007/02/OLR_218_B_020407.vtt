Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.440 --> 00:23.840
All right, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.120
We're taping live on February the 4th of 2007.

00:26.120 --> 00:31.760
Hey, if you want to join us for a live taping sometime, it's Sunday nights, 6 o'clock pacific,

00:31.760 --> 00:32.760
www.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:32.760 --> 00:37.320
And yes, we know there's a big football game that just wrapped up and folks are probably

00:37.320 --> 00:40.740
still at their parties, but here we are because we're loyal to the show.

00:40.740 --> 00:44.120
We love you guys and we love all of you that are in chat right now, even though there is

00:44.120 --> 00:49.460
still that football game, post-game stuff going on and whatever show is on after it

00:49.460 --> 00:51.560
this year and all that stuff going on.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.680
So thank you guys for being loyal and tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.640
Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.440
Who's starting us off in the next segment here?

00:58.440 --> 01:08.160
Well apparently there's news that Sony was basically saying, a spokesman from Sony, Dave,

01:08.160 --> 01:12.620
his name sounds like Cracker, Craker, I guess.

01:12.620 --> 01:17.700
He was quoted, they were talking about the whole, you know, format wars and stuff and

01:17.700 --> 01:22.720
talking about, you know, PlayStation 3 versus 360 and stuff.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.880
And then one of the things that they were talking about also was the Nintendo Wii and

01:26.880 --> 01:30.160
saying that it wasn't even in the same category as PlayStation 3.

01:30.160 --> 01:35.900
In fact, the Wii could be considered as an impulse buy more than anything else, which

01:35.900 --> 01:40.320
everyone was like, oh my God, you know, that's so crazy that he would say that, but I don't

01:40.320 --> 01:43.680
really think that's a, you know, okay, it is an impulse buy.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.320
It's cheaper than, you know.

01:46.320 --> 01:49.640
They're talking shit about the competition, oh noes, everybody does that.

01:49.640 --> 01:53.960
They're calling you, at least people are buying it.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.960
Impulse buy or not, huh?

01:55.960 --> 01:56.960
Exactly.

01:56.960 --> 01:57.960
All right.

01:57.960 --> 02:02.120
All right, so what do you think, Dark Soccer, is the Wii an impulse buy, is this a fair

02:02.120 --> 02:03.120
statement to make?

02:03.120 --> 02:06.640
I mean, I guess I've known some casual gamers who after playing Wii Tennis are like, I've

02:06.640 --> 02:08.120
got to get one of those.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.120
Is the Wii an impulse buy?

02:09.120 --> 02:16.080
Well, tell me what average person just happens to have, you know, 350 bucks lying around.

02:16.080 --> 02:22.080
You know, usually we have things to pay, like bills, or that's a car payment, you know.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.320
Well, somehow the three of us manage it.

02:24.320 --> 02:29.440
Well, yeah, but we also, you know, if we were responsible about it, planned out that purchase,

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
right?

02:30.440 --> 02:34.240
Right, and I did not budget a PlayStation 3, so I didn't buy them.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.160
We budgeted our PlayStation 3, we budgeted our Wii.

02:38.160 --> 02:42.080
I budgeted the Wii, but I did not budget a PlayStation 3, which is why I don't have one.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.580
I had to have mine three days early, so.

02:45.580 --> 02:51.480
And JV Mon in our chat room comes back with the classic, your mom is an impulse buy.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.000
That was pretty funny.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
That's why I said JV Mon.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.160
Last night!

02:57.160 --> 03:02.520
Anyhow, and the Rob D says, that's what happens when it's at a lower price than $599 US dollars.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.520
It's a little easier to be in.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.200
And it has more than 15 games.

03:06.200 --> 03:12.480
Well, I wouldn't go as far as to call it an impulse buy, but it is something that's easier

03:12.480 --> 03:13.480
to budget in.

03:13.480 --> 03:18.960
Okay, but be honest, though, and this is only fair, since, you know, we rip on Sony a lot,

03:18.960 --> 03:25.480
let me give it, you know, be fair here, uh, Nintendo, Wii, what's up with the Wii Connect

03:25.480 --> 03:26.480
24 thing?

03:26.480 --> 03:31.640
Because it obviously is not updating my firmware, it's not downloading new content for me, all

03:31.640 --> 03:34.960
it's doing is sending me messages that I can download some more content.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.560
Fucking, where is this automatic downloading shit?

03:37.560 --> 03:42.320
It's there for the purpose of illuminating your living room in a blue glow.

03:42.320 --> 03:47.000
Nintendo does not like to come out swinging with their stuff, haven't you noticed this

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
about them?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.240
They don't like to reveal all the secrets of their consoles, like look at what happened

03:51.240 --> 03:52.240
with the DS.

03:52.240 --> 03:55.260
No one knew that thing would have voice thing over the internet or even have internet play

03:55.260 --> 03:56.260
at all.

03:56.260 --> 03:59.320
I mean, it was kind of hinted at, but never was that announced.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.920
But Nintendo, for whatever reason, chooses to roll this out slowly.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.200
Xbox 360, they come out swinging.

04:05.200 --> 04:10.120
They lay their cock out on the table and say, thwack, here you go, it's all right here.

04:10.120 --> 04:14.600
I mean, that's really a fundamental difference between like Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo

04:14.600 --> 04:16.400
is the way they kind of...

04:16.400 --> 04:19.400
Even Sony, their online network, there's nothing on there!

04:19.400 --> 04:21.400
Give me something to buy!

04:21.400 --> 04:22.400
Landings?

04:22.400 --> 04:24.400
Gran Turismo?

04:24.400 --> 04:28.800
Gran Turismo's free, okay, but there's still nothing to buy in there, there's no new demos.

04:28.800 --> 04:33.080
There's PSP download games, that's completely useless, make the PSP download that shit!

04:33.080 --> 04:36.240
Why do I have to have a PlayStation 3 to download this crap?

04:36.240 --> 04:42.240
I mean, the PSP is capable of downloading this stuff too, you know, off the internet,

04:42.240 --> 04:45.520
or if it's going to take too long to do that, download it on your PC!

04:45.520 --> 04:46.720
That should be able to be done.

04:46.720 --> 04:51.680
I mean, you'd probably sell some more of those virtual, you know, those emulated PlayStation

04:51.680 --> 04:55.600
1 games if you did it that way, instead of having this stuff clutter the PlayStation

04:55.600 --> 05:01.240
store, because there's nothing on there right now, and one game a month is bullshit, because

05:01.240 --> 05:04.400
their games aren't that great to begin with.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.920
I don't know, it's just really disappointing, at least fucking Xbox Live gets it, you know,

05:08.920 --> 05:12.720
there's more stuff on there every week, you know, whether it be crap or not, at least

05:12.720 --> 05:17.200
there's fucking demos on there, I can say, you know, oh, new demos, can't say the same

05:17.200 --> 05:20.640
about PlayStation 3, I can certainly not say the same about the Wii, because there's nothing

05:20.640 --> 05:21.640
on there!

05:21.640 --> 05:22.640
Nothing!

05:22.640 --> 05:24.560
And only one game- Old games?

05:24.560 --> 05:28.400
One game supports Wii Connect 24, and that's Elibits, and to be honest, I haven't gotten

05:28.400 --> 05:30.260
shit from Elibits, you know, on the Wii Connect 24.

05:30.260 --> 05:33.680
Would you like me to send you an Elibit picture, for use in Elibits?

05:33.680 --> 05:36.040
I can do this for you, so you'll stop being such a bitch.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
No, I don't.

05:37.040 --> 05:41.200
But, the whole thing, it's just, you know, I thought that this would eliminate the fact

05:41.200 --> 05:45.040
of me having to wait to download these updates, or, you know, whatever, it's just, they're

05:45.040 --> 05:47.600
not using this shit.

05:47.600 --> 05:53.800
Going back to a very dirty comment I made earlier, Rama says, Xbox 360's cock puts a

05:53.800 --> 05:55.800
consumer's eye out.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.200
DarkTetsUya says, Rob just likes to say cock.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.200
Who doesn't?

05:59.200 --> 06:00.200
Who doesn't?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
Do you like to say other things?

06:01.200 --> 06:03.880
I like to say all dirty words, I like to say all types of dirty words.

06:03.880 --> 06:04.880
Who doesn't?

06:04.880 --> 06:12.400
Well, even though we saw that Sony was being cocky in that last story, get it?

06:12.400 --> 06:15.920
We have Nintendo accepting an award.

06:15.920 --> 06:22.080
The Wii and WarioWare won an International Toy Fair award, that's pretty cool, except

06:22.080 --> 06:27.600
when they said WarioWare won, they spelled it W-E-A-R.

06:27.600 --> 06:33.200
Well anyway, they won this International Toy Fair award, and they chose the Wii because,

06:33.200 --> 06:38.280
quote, encourages playing PC games in groups instead of alone, even though it's not really

06:38.280 --> 06:39.280
a PC game.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.840
Well, that's a whole other story.

06:40.840 --> 06:45.120
Also, quote, the product not only appeals to player types with an affinity to PCs, but

06:45.120 --> 06:51.640
also to new age groups, making it sound like I'm going to, like, you know, take herbs.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.720
They're talking out of their ass.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.960
I think it's just these folks, you know, they don't really deal with gaming every day, so

06:58.960 --> 07:04.760
it's, you know, they're used to giving awards to, like, Tickle Me Elmo, so I think that's

07:04.760 --> 07:09.720
kind of the, what makes this newsworthy is that the Wii has kind of jumped that boundary

07:09.720 --> 07:15.600
as becoming recognition as a toy, in general, and not just a gaming system.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.040
Kind of interesting, I don't know.

07:18.040 --> 07:22.720
I still don't think they get it, but I think this is pretty cool information, though.

07:22.720 --> 07:27.640
Atari Europe is announcing a Godzilla game for the Wii.

07:27.640 --> 07:32.400
And I'm sorry for the Wii, the DS, and the PSP.

07:32.400 --> 07:38.280
It's called Godzilla Unleashed, and it's supposed to be a non-linear game featuring everybody's

07:38.280 --> 07:41.760
favorite big green lizard, which, by the way, Godzilla is female.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.400
Stop saying that she's a he.

07:45.400 --> 07:50.880
So basically, you go around bashing stuff, kicking it, clawing it, stomping it, throwing

07:50.880 --> 07:56.080
poo at it, I don't know, but you go through major cities worldwide and are aiming for

07:56.080 --> 07:58.440
the title of king of all monsters.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.880
She'd be queen, Godzilla's female.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.880
She laid eggs.

08:01.880 --> 08:02.880
Sorry.

08:02.880 --> 08:11.000
Anyway, but it's a game that you basically work the storyline as you progress.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.040
I think that's pretty cool, very dynamic, especially given that you're using the Wii

08:17.040 --> 08:18.040
controller for it.

08:18.040 --> 08:22.160
Well, I'm glad to see rampages coming out over there.

08:22.160 --> 08:29.800
That was another thought I had, but I'm hoping that we get, like, Mothra and, you know, Gamera.

08:29.800 --> 08:35.120
I'm glad to learn that we will have an accurate reenactment of a woman during her time of

08:35.120 --> 08:38.360
the month on a console.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.360
You see these bills?

08:39.360 --> 08:40.360
Yes.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.360
Ow.

08:41.360 --> 08:45.420
It does explain why she constantly, you know, probably doesn't know where she's at because

08:45.420 --> 08:49.560
she does it in bad directions, you know, oh, I fucking thought this was, like, the middle

08:49.560 --> 08:51.120
of the ocean, but shit, it's Japan.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.560
Well, goddammit, I'm pissed now.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.520
I'm going to blow things up with fire.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.800
Actually, no, I think the second Godzilla is male.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.880
I would be shocked if Jamie comes back next week.

09:01.880 --> 09:06.880
Of course, someone's got to keep us in line, yes, Jamie?

09:06.880 --> 09:07.880
Am I getting the finger?

09:07.880 --> 09:08.880
Oh.

09:08.880 --> 09:09.880
No, Matt was getting the finger.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.760
Usually when it's silent, I'm getting the finger.

09:11.760 --> 09:16.160
Wouldn't moths like to fly up in the space and fly into the sun because moths are, you

09:16.160 --> 09:17.160
know, attracted to fire?

09:17.160 --> 09:18.160
Moths are stupid.

09:18.160 --> 09:22.960
That's a dumb, why the hell would they create a moth, you know, monster anyways?

09:22.960 --> 09:25.200
That's the dumbest thing ever.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.400
But, but, but, but, but Gamera was cool.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.800
Gamera is really neat.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.800
Flying turtle.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.320
The last time I played a Godzilla game was the old ass NES game that they had with you.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.160
Super NES game was fucking awesome.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.160
And I played...

09:38.160 --> 09:39.160
Or was it NES?

09:39.160 --> 09:40.160
I don't remember.

09:40.160 --> 09:43.840
It was a King of Monsters game, which wasn't really Godzilla, but pretty much.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.840
On NEOGEO.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.840
NEOGEO.

09:45.840 --> 09:46.840
Anyway.

09:46.840 --> 09:47.840
Alright, forget it.

09:47.840 --> 09:54.880
So, what's kind of interesting though, and this is, I guess, you know, your random Nintendo

09:54.880 --> 09:56.680
game sighting.

09:56.680 --> 10:01.720
They have an easter egg in their DS dictionary thing, because we don't get any actual non-games

10:01.720 --> 10:02.720
over here.

10:02.720 --> 10:13.080
Apparently, if you look up the word for ball, you can actually find, it says one of two

10:13.080 --> 10:15.520
translations in the dictionary.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
One of them that's grayed out.

10:16.520 --> 10:21.680
If you click on the grayed out one, it brings up the Game & Watch game, Ball.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.680
So you get to play that kind of little easter egg that's thrown in there.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.680
And it was for them.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.680
Oh, hooray.

10:27.680 --> 10:28.680
I love Ball.

10:28.680 --> 10:32.360
I love Mr. Game & Watch.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.080
I don't know.

10:34.080 --> 10:38.560
Well, something else a lot of us love and can't wait to see a new version of this is

10:38.560 --> 10:40.200
Punch Out!

10:40.200 --> 10:48.840
And according to gonintendo.com, Punch Out! might be coming to the Wii pretty soon here.

10:48.840 --> 10:53.600
Now of course, a lot of these rumors come from patents and trademark offices, and that's

10:53.600 --> 10:56.560
where Go Nintendo is getting their idea from.

10:56.560 --> 11:01.080
Nintendo filed a Punch Out! trademark again in April of 2005, and it was recently updated

11:01.080 --> 11:02.680
on January 11th.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.320
Now who knows if they're just kind of holding on to it, just making sure no one else tries

11:06.320 --> 11:08.340
to take the name or whatever they're doing.

11:08.340 --> 11:14.080
But certainly when you look at something like Wii Boxing, you can't help but go, it's just

11:14.080 --> 11:18.080
a matter of time before this comes out on, you know, Punch Out! on the Wii.

11:18.080 --> 11:22.320
It's too bad it won't be Mike Tyson's Punch Out! though.

11:22.320 --> 11:28.080
That would be Mike Tyson's Ear Fest.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.040
Mike Tyson's... never mind, I'm gonna make a really bad joke here, let's move on before

11:32.040 --> 11:35.600
I get myself in trouble.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.600
You know...

11:36.600 --> 11:40.780
I just wanted to say I really love this game, I love the Nintendo Wii.

11:40.780 --> 11:44.600
I'm sure his Wii, uh... never mind.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.760
Also I love fighting off ears and rape!

11:46.760 --> 11:51.440
Now this should make a lot of people very, very happy.

11:51.440 --> 11:59.640
Tyson's favorite luchador, Strong Bad, is on the Wii, kinda.

11:59.640 --> 12:11.240
The uh, our favorite developer, Vid-uh, Vid-electrics, has created Vid-electrics, which is a collection

12:11.240 --> 12:17.400
of some of their games that are remastered for Wii control.

12:17.400 --> 12:21.340
And uh, the quote says, the guys at Vid-electrics have reworked a few of your favorite games

12:21.340 --> 12:25.640
for use on your favorite wave around controller game system.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.440
I think that is great.

12:27.440 --> 12:37.400
You have uh, Strong Bad Zone, Secret Collect, Kid Speedy, um, More to Come, Population Tire,

12:37.400 --> 12:39.520
and More to Come.

12:39.520 --> 12:48.240
You can um, you basically go to your Wii browser to um, the uh, I guess, it's the Vid-electrics

12:48.240 --> 13:02.200
page that of course is, you know, associated with HomestarRunner.com, um, but it's Vid-e-l-e-c-t-r-i-x-dot-com-slash-v-i-i-v.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.600
You know, I predicted a while ago HomestarRunner was gonna jump the shark and sell out to like

13:05.600 --> 13:07.500
Cartoon Network, but I guess I've been wrong.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.000
They uh, still have been uh, just kind of trucking along with their web following there.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.320
But now it's interesting to kind of see them tiptoeing into the console games a little

13:15.320 --> 13:16.320
bit, you know.

13:16.320 --> 13:20.600
I actually think it's pretty great that this started off as, you know, kind of not that

13:20.600 --> 13:26.640
great books for children, and it just turned into this big internet phenomenon.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.480
It just goes to show that good things come to those who wait, right?

13:29.480 --> 13:32.720
We need A Peasant's Tale the game on Wii.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.200
So since we've been doing this show five years now, just about, we should be getting those

13:36.200 --> 13:38.160
rewards anytime soon now, huh?

13:38.160 --> 13:39.160
Right?

13:39.160 --> 13:40.160
Yeah?

13:40.160 --> 13:41.160
That was funny.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.160
We'll just be right here waiting for you.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.760
La la la la la.

13:44.760 --> 13:52.080
Anyways, other things you can do with your Wii, of course, non-Kozer things like modding

13:52.080 --> 13:53.080
it.

13:53.080 --> 13:59.120
In fact, there have been three teams that have been releasing their announcements for

13:59.120 --> 14:00.440
Wii mod chips.

14:00.440 --> 14:06.800
So before not, we're going to have backups and region-free Wiis, which is always good.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.260
Well, the region-free part, at least.

14:10.260 --> 14:15.040
One of these teams, Team Cyclops, they announced their Wii mod chip, which is supposed to be

14:15.040 --> 14:22.000
able to play backups of both Wii and GameCube games, GameCube homebrew, imports of GameCube

14:22.000 --> 14:31.080
games, and as well as DVD-R and support, and you're supposed to be able to have it as stealth

14:31.080 --> 14:32.420
as well.

14:32.420 --> 14:37.440
One other one that's actually supposed to be coming out pretty soon, it's called the

14:37.440 --> 14:43.200
Wii Key, and that one's also going to be able to be updated via DVD, so it's supposed to

14:43.200 --> 14:47.920
be future-proof, much like PlayStation 3, and it's supposed to be able to play backups

14:47.920 --> 14:53.840
of both Wii and GameCube games, different region GameCube games and backups, multi-disc

14:53.840 --> 14:56.600
games, and etc.

14:56.600 --> 15:02.800
So this one's actually supposed to start shipping on February 7th, so maybe we'll find out a

15:02.800 --> 15:04.400
little bit more of this next week.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.400
Interesting.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.440
Are you going to order one?

15:08.440 --> 15:11.040
I don't know how to solder for shit, so probably not.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.020
I thought you used to do that.

15:14.020 --> 15:17.120
If you've seen any of my solder jobs, they're awful.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.840
You know somebody who has a very expensive soldering iron who has experience with doing

15:21.840 --> 15:24.280
these types of things now?

15:24.280 --> 15:25.480
You?

15:25.480 --> 15:26.480
My hubby.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.920
Oh, yeah, from the pinball stuff.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.640
He fixes his own pinball machines and has put together his main cabinet.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.560
Let's get him to mod your Wii, maybe.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.560
All right.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.600
Well, anyhow, one thing that you can do on the Wii, of course, is play old games, which

15:36.600 --> 15:40.280
is funny because most people want to hack them to install emulators on them, but the

15:40.280 --> 15:41.280
Wii has one built in.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.760
But the emulators are not perfect, as folks are finding out this week and downloading

15:44.760 --> 15:49.640
Mario Kart 64 because you cannot save ghost data in Mario Kart 64.

15:49.640 --> 15:50.640
Guess what?

15:50.640 --> 15:55.280
Nintendo says, quote, due to unavoidable technical reasons, unfortunately it is not possible

15:55.280 --> 16:01.760
to save ghost data for Mario 64's time trials in the virtual console version of the game.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.760
They did place messages advising users about this before they download the game when the

16:05.760 --> 16:09.880
Wii Shop channel is first accessed and in the more details tab on the individual game

16:09.880 --> 16:10.880
page.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.880
That's true.

16:11.880 --> 16:16.200
The manual, they're in big red letters, you can't save ghost data.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.200
I honestly think people are making too big a deal out of this.

16:19.200 --> 16:26.040
I didn't have a memory pack when I owned Mario Kart 64, so I never had ghost data anyway.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.560
How many people had a Nintendo 64, let alone the memory pack?

16:29.560 --> 16:33.560
Of course, I know that's just opening up for the chat to start going, me, me, me, me, me,

16:33.560 --> 16:37.160
but honestly, I don't think this is as huge of a loss.

16:37.160 --> 16:43.600
What I suppose where people are getting frustrated is that the Wii has this giant storage built

16:43.600 --> 16:44.600
into it.

16:44.600 --> 16:49.640
Why can't the emulator be smart enough to just save to the Wii thing?

16:49.640 --> 16:51.880
Like virtual memory cards on the PlayStation 3.

16:51.880 --> 16:58.960
But you'd be talking about going in and editing Mario Kart 64's game information to do that

16:58.960 --> 17:01.720
because it would be talking about accessing data a whole other way.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.600
You'd have to rewrite the game or recompile the game.

17:04.600 --> 17:10.400
Perhaps they could patch it with, I don't know, Wii Connect 24 that they're not using?

17:10.400 --> 17:11.400
They're not going to do it.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
Nintendo says they're not going to do it.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.840
The PC emulators, though, always saved the information.

17:16.840 --> 17:22.360
The ROMs themselves actually have the emulator built into it when you're downloading it,

17:22.360 --> 17:24.520
so it wouldn't be that hard for them to fix that.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.800
All they have to do is edit the emulator.

17:27.800 --> 17:28.800
But no.

17:28.800 --> 17:29.880
Yeah, why should they?

17:29.880 --> 17:32.280
Because no one really cares about that shit anyways.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.600
Well, Legend of Zaku agrees and says, ghost data?

17:34.600 --> 17:35.600
Who the fuck uses that?

17:35.600 --> 17:39.440
And that's probably followed up by Boco Fett saying, I love ghost mode.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.000
And Rob D seems to agree they could include a patch with the game.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.760
This is all coming from our chatroom chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.720
Hitstun says, oh, come on, you can't emulate a friggin' controller pack?

17:49.720 --> 17:54.280
I think it just might be in the way that the original system talked to the hardware.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.920
I don't know if it's as easy as folks think it is.

17:56.920 --> 17:57.920
Well, just like they were talking about doing it later on.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.880
If it was that easy, Nintendo would have done it.

17:59.880 --> 18:00.880
Rumble later on.

18:00.880 --> 18:01.880
Maybe through an add-on?

18:01.880 --> 18:02.880
Yeah.

18:02.880 --> 18:03.880
Well, how about multiplayer online?

18:03.880 --> 18:07.640
I think all of us would forgive Nintendo for the stupid ghost thing if we could do some

18:07.640 --> 18:08.640
multiplayer online.

18:08.640 --> 18:09.640
Wouldn't that be pretty awesome?

18:09.640 --> 18:11.520
Oh, that would be fuckin' awesome.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.400
In the real world, however.

18:14.400 --> 18:19.040
And M64 says, Skya, I think you only download the emulator once per system.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.520
Not sure on the specifics of that, possibly.

18:20.520 --> 18:21.520
Who knows?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.120
But you see, the thing, though, is once you purchase a game, you can delete it and redownload

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
it again.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.600
So if that's the case, they could say, OK, there's an update to this game, please redownload

18:28.600 --> 18:29.600
it.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
And boom.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
Done.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.000
And you're supposed to do all that automatically.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Right.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
ReConnect24 is a service that they sell, but don't actually fuckin' use.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
So what's the point?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
But that's not a surprise.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.800
They did the same thing on the DS.

18:41.800 --> 18:42.800
Same thing.

18:42.800 --> 18:43.800
Anyhow.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.200
Yeah, I know.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.200
Let's move on.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.840
Let's get some more user feedback.

18:48.840 --> 18:53.280
And one way we invite you guys, the listeners, to come on and be a part of the program, because

18:53.280 --> 18:54.280
it's not just us.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.560
I mean, you know, this is your show, too.

18:56.560 --> 19:01.040
And one way you can participate is by sending us an email to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.880
Every week, DarkSakura opens up the email bag and dives in and grabs a few of her favorite

19:05.880 --> 19:07.800
letters, and reads them here on air.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.800
It's the Mailbag segment.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.280
Slim Pickens this week, though, right, DarkSakura?

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
Not a lot of emails?

19:12.280 --> 19:14.280
Well, we got a bunch of big fat ones.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.280
Oh, there you go.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.280
We like long letters.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.560
Well, one of the emails comes from GS191.

19:18.560 --> 19:25.400
However, I'm not reading the part about Jennifer Strange, because honestly, I'm sick of it.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.800
Although we appreciate the feedback, I think we're all trying to move on from that whole

19:28.800 --> 19:29.800
thing.

19:29.800 --> 19:30.800
But thank you for your insight.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.800
Thank you for being on the Internet.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.760
You know, and as you find us, financial assessment and your very own name is, you know, what

19:33.760 --> 19:34.740
we're thinking, and we...

19:34.740 --> 19:35.740
Anyway.

19:35.740 --> 19:36.600
Oh, there's also the disclaimer that...

19:36.600 --> 19:40.680
Just because Loki wasn't on a mic Loki said we just can't continue to drown ourselves

19:40.680 --> 19:41.680
in that information.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.680
Arr!

19:42.680 --> 19:44.340
It smells like meat in here.

19:44.340 --> 19:46.320
Because he's eating a hamburger and he left the cart open.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.480
Which you know what that means.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.780
French fries stealing.

19:48.780 --> 19:49.880
Fries stealing!

19:49.880 --> 19:50.880
O shit.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.600
Okay, an Ebony.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
Sorry.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.720
I need an eat em.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.060
Oh no, I need an wiener.

19:57.060 --> 19:58.600
Talk with your mouth full.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.600
Okay.

19:59.600 --> 20:06.600
I don't know what I read in the email.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.600
Okay, now the Frapper map, the bane of my existence.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.600
Can I smell fries in my mouth?

20:15.600 --> 20:17.600
I really don't know what to do.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.600
Give me more fries, give me more fries.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.600
These are good fries.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.600
They're elephant bar, they're pretty good.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.600
That one was too salty though.

20:26.600 --> 20:31.600
I really don't know what to do anymore about the Frapper map.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.600
Ever since the switch from Google Maps to Yahoo Maps,

20:34.600 --> 20:37.600
the performance of the website has gone down a lot.

20:37.600 --> 20:43.600
I really screwed up the editing and refer to the point that you can go to your forums,

20:43.600 --> 20:48.600
you can do that, but it takes out the shout out listings on the Frapper page.

20:48.600 --> 20:52.600
So you're forced to use their forums if you want to see shout outs on the page.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.600
Or if you use your own forums, take it automatically.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.600
It takes the shout outs off the page.

20:58.600 --> 21:02.600
Being the administrator of the Frapper map, I'm at a fork in the road.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.600
There are many times that I was so discontent with the map

21:05.600 --> 21:08.600
that I almost leave the map and start over again.

21:08.600 --> 21:13.600
The one good thing is that there is an embedded HTML option when I customize the map,

21:13.600 --> 21:16.600
so that gives me some hope on getting this to where I like it,

21:16.600 --> 21:19.600
and hopefully everyone else does too.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.600
Currently the map has 141 members,

21:22.600 --> 21:25.600
but I know that there is a much larger community out there.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.600
With more support, it will motivate me further, hopefully.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.600
So as of now, I will keep it up, but if the Frapper screws up again,

21:31.600 --> 21:33.600
I just don't know what to do.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.600
We'll try to support the Frapper map, and I will do my best to maintain it.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.600
Thank you.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.600
Look at our Frapper map. It's pretty nice.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.600
I have it up on the screen here.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.600
If you want to see it, it's frapper.com slash orange lounge radio.

21:42.600 --> 21:47.600
There's really nothing to this besides just the fact it's kind of cool to see where our listeners are.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.600
You notice we have a lot scattered throughout the U.S.,

21:50.600 --> 21:54.600
but what I'm really noticing a lack of is the pins over in the U.K.

21:54.600 --> 21:55.600
Look at that.

21:55.600 --> 21:56.600
There's like three pins over there.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.600
Come on.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.600
I know we've got more listeners than that over there,

21:58.600 --> 22:03.600
and then look, Australia, if I go over to Australia, there's like a pin.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.600
So we want to especially, not that we love our U.S. listeners,

22:06.600 --> 22:10.600
we want to really see some of our international listeners put a pin in the map somewhere,

22:10.600 --> 22:13.600
but I am going to steal what they do at All Games Interactive.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
I am going to replace what's over here.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.600
We're going to put a big map up here,

22:16.600 --> 22:21.600
and we're going to put pins in whenever we get calls and the e-mails from different parts of the world.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.600
We'll have one color for calls and one color for e-mails.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.600
So we're going to start our own real-life Frapper.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.600
But in the meantime, the online one will have to do frapper.com slash orange lounge radio.

22:29.600 --> 22:33.600
That was a fan-created thing, so thank you to this e-mailer who created it.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.600
Hugs and kisses.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.600
Well, next e-mail.

22:36.600 --> 22:37.600
Hi, guys.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.600
DDR Dollar Bill here.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.600
Hoping your days are going well for you guys.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.600
Thanks for the updates from Konami Gamer's Day,

22:43.600 --> 22:46.600
which now made my picking of the newest system very difficult.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
This is why.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.600
This weekend I was in the Chinatown section here in New York,

22:51.600 --> 22:55.600
and while browsing through the anime picked up three series I haven't seen yet,

22:55.600 --> 22:58.600
I was also checking out the imports and had some thoughts.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.600
In the past, in order to play imported games,

23:00.600 --> 23:03.600
the systems would need to be modified in some fashion.

23:03.600 --> 23:08.600
I can recall back in the cartridge systems where you'd have to buy an adapter to play these games

23:08.600 --> 23:12.600
or actually just break open your Super Nintendo and pull stuff out.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.600
Super Nintendo one was funny.

23:15.600 --> 23:20.600
Or having your CD DVD-based systems modified with a mod chip or swap desk or a paper clip.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.600
Sorry.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.600
I know that the Game Boy DS systems did not need any modification,

23:26.600 --> 23:28.600
which is probably why I enjoyed them the most.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.600
My question is this.

23:30.600 --> 23:34.600
For the systems I did not list that are current are the following true.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
Xbox 360 region locked.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.600
No safe mod exists.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.600
Safe as in you will not be banned from Xbox Live.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.600
Wii region locked. No mod exists yet.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
PS3 not region locked on PS3 games.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.600
Region locked on PS2 games.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.600
PSP not region locked.

23:48.600 --> 23:53.600
I'm asking this because I'm going to be getting back into purchasing import titles,

23:53.600 --> 23:55.600
not just the Bemani stuff,

23:55.600 --> 23:58.600
but also some of their wrestling games,

23:58.600 --> 24:03.600
which has been more original and fun than the Smackdown vs. Raw,

24:03.600 --> 24:09.600
and other little oddities such as D.O.N. DBZ vs. One Piece vs. Naruto.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.600
I don't care about playing backup copies, honestly,

24:12.600 --> 24:16.600
and I don't want to get one system of each,

24:16.600 --> 24:18.600
as that would be a waste of money.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.600
I wish they would just let everyone pick and choose what to play,

24:21.600 --> 24:23.600
regardless of where it's coming from.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.600
Anywho, I could go on for another hour, but I'll leave it like that.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.600
See you guys in the chat room tonight.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.600
PS, I miss freestyle sometimes.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.600
I do believe the PlayStation 3 regions for the game.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.600
At least Blu-Ray.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.600
One is both Japan and the United States.

24:39.600 --> 24:43.600
When we talk about importing Japanese games, I think that works.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.600
At least I don't know about the movies that might work,

24:45.600 --> 24:47.600
but the games I'm not sure.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.600
Once again, you probably just need to check maybe with import sites

24:50.600 --> 24:53.600
to deal with that kind of stuff, whether that will work or not.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.600
360 I know doesn't.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.600
I'm going to be in San Francisco this weekend,

24:57.600 --> 25:00.600
so if I go by Mikado I can ask them there since they keep up with all that.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.600
I know they were saying that it is and it isn't,

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
but I know it's not region free,

25:05.600 --> 25:09.600
but I think that we're in the same region as Japan now.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.600
Interesting.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.600
That makes sense because we're both NTSC.

25:14.600 --> 25:18.600
Not that it's going to matter for anything in a high definition format,

25:18.600 --> 25:20.600
but I can sort of see it.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.600
SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says,

25:22.600 --> 25:24.600
You can use the GameCube freeloader on the Wii.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.600
Positive. I've seen it done.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.600
I have a freeloader.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.600
But that's only for GameCube games.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.600
That's not for Wii games.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.600
I'm still going to check it out though.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.600
I want to try it for myself.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.600
But that's pretty cool.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.600
It's really only a matter of time though

25:40.600 --> 25:43.600
before anything that is region locked will be unlocked.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.600
I am one of those people who said,

25:46.600 --> 25:50.600
I'm not modding my PS2 and went out and bought a JPS2.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.600
Ditto. I did it too.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.600
PlayStation 2 Japanese games do not work on a US PlayStation 2.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.600
Or a PlayStation 3.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.600
I know somebody in chat,

25:59.600 --> 26:02.600
I think Black Boy says PS2 Japanese games work on PlayStation 3,

26:02.600 --> 26:05.600
but actually one of the sites had video of trying Kingdom Hearts 2,

26:05.600 --> 26:07.600
the import on PlayStation 3,

26:07.600 --> 26:09.600
and it came up with an error message.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.600
So I'm not sure if that's true.

26:11.600 --> 26:16.600
One thing though that I am curious about though is the freeloader.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.600
If they're going to have...

26:19.600 --> 26:21.600
Well, not the freeloader,

26:21.600 --> 26:24.600
but what was the one for PlayStation hard drive?

26:24.600 --> 26:26.600
HD loader?

26:26.600 --> 26:28.600
HD loader. That was it.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.600
If they're going to be coming up with something like that.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.600
But it's still out there for the PlayStation 2.

26:32.600 --> 26:36.600
If you can find the old style one or even the new style one,

26:36.600 --> 26:40.600
you can download the HD loader that actually fits on your memory card.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.600
And then you just plug in a USB drive.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.600
Or USB hard drive or something like that.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.600
And it works great for imports.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.600
Well, they even have the thing where you can...

26:52.600 --> 26:53.600
I guess it's the same thing.

26:53.600 --> 26:59.600
You download it directly to your hard drive on the system.

26:59.600 --> 27:03.600
I mean, not that we're condoning that eye roll,

27:03.600 --> 27:07.600
but I wonder if they're going to have something like that for PS3

27:07.600 --> 27:09.600
and then that makes the importing...

27:09.600 --> 27:12.600
Or you remember back in the days with the GameCube

27:12.600 --> 27:16.600
how they had the whole GD-ROM rip through the VMU unit.

27:16.600 --> 27:17.600
Remember that?

27:17.600 --> 27:20.600
I wonder if they'd be doing something along those lines too.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.600
Just to clarify, it looks like I understand where I misunderstood.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.600
Black Boy said,

27:24.600 --> 27:27.600
I've played Japanese PlayStation 2 games on the Japanese PlayStation 3.

27:27.600 --> 27:31.600
Well, yeah, that'll work. I thought he meant Japanese PlayStation 2 to US PlayStation 3.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
And that's what the video was of.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
So, oops.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
Okay.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
Next email.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.600
And this comes from Neki, our friend.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.600
Hi, Neki.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.600
Heya, O-L-R.

27:42.600 --> 27:46.600
Didn't get around to emailing last week, but I got some stuff today.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.600
This is my second time typing this.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.600
Since the first one screwed up, I hope it doesn't happen again.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.600
Check out attachment one.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.600
Okay, I didn't actually see there was attachments with this one.

27:56.600 --> 28:00.600
It will show the Wii with over 4 million sales,

28:00.600 --> 28:02.600
the 360 with 10 million,

28:02.600 --> 28:06.600
and the PS3 with the tiny 1 million owned.

28:06.600 --> 28:10.600
I would just like to give a big shout out towards my home forum site,

28:10.600 --> 28:13.600
dscommunity.co.uk.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.600
It's nice and fun, so everyone join the forums.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.600
There's your free shout out.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.600
Oh, yeah, and by the way, we are doing a DS tournament on Wednesday

28:20.600 --> 28:25.600
starting from, it looks like July 2nd this year

28:25.600 --> 28:28.600
at about 7 to 12 p.m. GMT.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.600
Everyone is welcome, but it would be a good idea to join the forums first

28:31.600 --> 28:33.600
plus we got chat.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.600
Anyway, there's your free plug.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.600
Free plug.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.600
Did they plug us on their forums?

28:39.600 --> 28:41.600
That's what I want to know.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.600
Plug us on your forums now because we're awesome.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.600
Yes, fries. Rock.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.600
And so a question for me is where it got the music.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.600
Dude, fries.

28:52.600 --> 28:53.600
I'm not like hungry.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.600
I haven't eaten since there's pancakes today.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.600
Gave me an email.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.600
Okay, sorry.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.600
Sorry, necky.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.600
A question for me was where did they get the music for the show.

29:04.600 --> 29:10.600
I really went about the FUs of the Week,

29:10.600 --> 29:14.600
your website of the week and the show's ending music.

29:14.600 --> 29:18.600
The FUs of the Week music is actually from the Final Fantasy VII

29:18.600 --> 29:20.600
Advent Children movie.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.600
It's the one wing angel.

29:22.600 --> 29:30.600
The big final battle in that movie, yep.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.600
The website of the week music, isn't that Journey to Wonderland?

29:33.600 --> 29:35.600
No, that's the mailbag music.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.600
It's Journey to Wonderland.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.600
Website of the Week is from DDR Ohastas.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.600
That's right.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.600
It's candy.

29:41.600 --> 29:47.600
You can actually dance to that in the Japanese version of DDR.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.600
I've done it.

29:48.600 --> 29:49.600
It's awesome.

29:49.600 --> 29:53.600
The first is the Ohastasian kids version.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.600
It's kind of cute.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.600
What was the Ohaska?

29:59.600 --> 30:01.600
It's got a lot of cute songs in it.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.600
It's fun.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.600
And our ending show music, Rob knows that one because it's from Beatmania.

30:05.600 --> 30:09.600
It's Akira Yamaoka, iFuturist.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.600
Also in DDR Supernova, I believe.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.600
Yep.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.600
The godly and studly Akira Yamaoka who produces Silent Hill now as well.

30:16.600 --> 30:20.600
I was actually watching the making of Silent Hill 3 and he was in it and he sounded really hoarse.

30:20.600 --> 30:21.600
He's such a rock star.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.600
I met him once like three years ago.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.600
He was awesome.

30:24.600 --> 30:25.600
I like his business cards.

30:25.600 --> 30:28.600
Anyway, can't think of anything else.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
Thanks for the podcast.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Really enjoy it.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.600
Keep it up, Nike.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.600
P.S. I found a Dr. Who thing you might get very excited about.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.600
Haven't read it all as it's long.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
Dr. Who the game?

30:38.600 --> 30:39.600
Huh.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.600
Why don't we talk about something like that?

30:41.600 --> 30:42.600
Oh my god.

30:42.600 --> 30:43.600
Huh.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.600
It looks like they're going to be doing a Dr. Who game.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.600
That's not a big surprise.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.600
That makes me a happy fangirl.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.600
Alright.

30:52.600 --> 30:57.600
Oh, they're showing some of the old games though like the PC Dalek games anyway.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.600
Anyway, that's for me later.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
Anything else?

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
Yes.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
Oh, sorry.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.600
Hi.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.600
This is from Bandit.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
Hi guys.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.600
How's it going?

31:07.600 --> 31:11.600
Been listening to the show for a while and decided to send in an email for a change.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.600
I just wanted to stop and voice an opinion that I've had for a while about moving to

31:15.600 --> 31:16.600
the next gen.

31:16.600 --> 31:21.600
Sure, when you look at the shiny new hardware that's out there from the big three, you may

31:21.600 --> 31:25.600
want to go out and buy the newest and greatest, but at this point, I've seen no reason to

31:25.600 --> 31:27.600
do so yet.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.600
After all of these years of playing games, mostly competitive type games, I've become

31:30.600 --> 31:32.600
more of a casual gamer than anything.

31:32.600 --> 31:38.600
I find myself spending more time reading gaming news through various online sites than actually

31:38.600 --> 31:40.600
playing them.

31:40.600 --> 31:45.600
It was really hard not to just throw down the cash and buy a new console on any of the

31:45.600 --> 31:48.600
launches, but I had to take a step back and look at what I currently have.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.600
The prime console I own is the PS2.

31:51.600 --> 31:57.600
When I actually took a look back at the games that I've yet to play over the years, I realized

31:57.600 --> 32:00.600
that purchasing a new console would be a bad idea, especially considering the prices of

32:00.600 --> 32:01.600
games now.

32:01.600 --> 32:07.600
I've actually never played God of War, Devil May Cry 1 or 3, and many other critically

32:07.600 --> 32:11.600
reviewed, I'm sorry, acclaimed titles like these.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.600
There's not enough time in the day to play everything.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.600
I haven't played some of those.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.600
I really missed a lot of great titles on the PS2 by only playing certain games such as

32:19.600 --> 32:21.600
Madden and Tekken 5.

32:21.600 --> 32:25.600
Certainly with the case of Tekken 5, I would spend hours learning a character's move list

32:25.600 --> 32:29.600
and practicing before visiting a group of the best local players here in Pittsburgh

32:29.600 --> 32:32.600
who go by the name of Steel City Tekken.

32:32.600 --> 32:36.600
Believe me, the practice had to be done to stand a chance against them.

32:36.600 --> 32:41.600
Now, getting back to the point I'm trying to make, if you're the type of person who

32:41.600 --> 32:46.600
missed out on a lot of games from the PS2 era, take a look at how many great AAA titles

32:46.600 --> 32:50.600
you can buy on that console for the price of one next-gen game.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.600
After looking through EB Games 1999 and Undersection on their site, I saw that you could get up

32:54.600 --> 32:58.600
to seven PS2 games for the price of one $60 next-gen title.

32:58.600 --> 33:03.600
So if you haven't yet made the commitment to any new next-gen console, I would go as

33:03.600 --> 33:08.600
to say that the PS2 has one of the two greatest library of games ever on any console.

33:08.600 --> 33:12.600
The original NES will always be first, in my opinion.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.600
Also remember that the PS2 is not dead yet.

33:14.600 --> 33:20.600
We still have Luminesce Live, God of War 2, and Final Cut of Kingdoms Hearts 2 to play soon.

33:20.600 --> 33:24.600
Since I decided to stick with the PS2 a little longer, I went out and picked up a few games

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
that I missed.

33:25.600 --> 33:30.600
I grabbed Syphon Filter Omega Stream, Devil May Cry Collector's Box Set, and Area 51,

33:30.600 --> 33:34.600
not the original that was in the arcades and on the PS1 Saturn, for less than $60.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.600
A five-to-one game ratio really sounds good to me right now.

33:37.600 --> 33:41.600
I could write much more to prove my point, but I'm sure everyone can see where I'm coming

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
from.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.600
Anyway, have a great show, and long live the PS2.

33:44.600 --> 33:47.600
Could I say, though, that two of those games he says that we have to look forward to, we've

33:47.600 --> 33:50.600
kind of already played, like Luminesce Live and Kingdom Hearts 2.

33:50.600 --> 33:54.600
I mean, granted, you have some new stuff with those, but essentially we've seen those before.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.600
I stopped playing Kingdom Hearts 2 as soon as they announced the Final Cut, because I'm

33:58.600 --> 33:59.600
going to start over on that one.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.600
All right, whatever.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.600
Seriously.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.600
I understand.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.600
I understand.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.600
I need to go back and finish Kingdom Hearts 1.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.600
I never finish games.

34:07.600 --> 34:08.600
I can't.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.600
There's not enough time in the day.

34:09.600 --> 34:13.600
I have to really love a game to finish it, and then my problem is I get sucked into MMOs.

34:13.600 --> 34:17.600
Well, here's the last email, and I'm not going to read all of it, because there's a bunch

34:17.600 --> 34:21.600
of reviews about the same sequel of the games and everything.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.600
Hey, OLR.

34:22.600 --> 34:26.600
This is the information about the Shadow Hearts RPG series that I promised a couple of weeks

34:26.600 --> 34:27.600
ago.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.600
I apologize for taking so long.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.600
I definitely recommend that you give the series a try.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.600
The first Shadow Hearts game, however, is hard to find, so you might have to find it

34:33.600 --> 34:34.600
on eBay.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.600
I'm interested on your opinions about the series.

34:36.600 --> 34:37.600
Have a great night.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.600
Shadow next gen.

34:39.600 --> 34:43.600
And we have various links to them, so I'm going to check them out a little bit later.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
Shadow Hearts, the series?

34:44.600 --> 34:45.600
Yeah.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.600
I know the last one that came out of New World looked pretty good.

34:48.600 --> 34:53.600
Just didn't play it, because I don't have time to play every obscure RPG out there.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.600
But yeah, it looked pretty cool.

34:55.600 --> 35:01.600
Kind of a unique concept, kind of set in the 1940s, I believe.

35:01.600 --> 35:09.600
You play a detective son who ends up finding these portals to another dimension almost,

35:09.600 --> 35:15.600
and the stuff starts coming through, and basically has to fight it with a bunch of your usual,

35:15.600 --> 35:22.600
typical RPG plot, a bunch of people that have no reason to be together, kind of come together,

35:22.600 --> 35:25.600
and fight monsters and stuff.

35:25.600 --> 35:30.600
It looks like a lot of folks in chat room agree with my gamer ADD perspective.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.600
Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, you're not the only one who does that.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.600
Paradox Vincent says, OMG, thank you, Sky, thank you, thank you, I'm not alone.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.600
That's why I play music games.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.600
And I think, to go back to what I had said in part A about somebody had said all I ever

35:41.600 --> 35:45.600
seem to play are Xbox Live Arcade games, I think that might go help to explain it right

35:45.600 --> 35:49.600
there, is that Xbox Live Arcade games, again, they're quick and not a lot of time, and really

35:49.600 --> 35:51.600
satisfy my gamer ADD.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.600
And yet, why I keep going back to World of Warcraft, I'll never understand.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.600
I think it's the social aspect of that.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.600
Who knows?

35:56.600 --> 36:00.600
Well, my whole thing is, that's sort of why I was stuck on Cooking Mama for that long.

36:00.600 --> 36:06.600
But, you know, I was thinking about it, and I own a lot of games that I haven't given

36:06.600 --> 36:08.600
the attention that I'd like to give.

36:08.600 --> 36:13.600
So, like, I'm going back, I've started over on Papalo Cross, just because, you know how

36:13.600 --> 36:17.600
I was up in arms about how much I wanted to play that game, you know, for years.

36:17.600 --> 36:22.600
So, I actually started over on Papalo Cross, so I can get to where I got before and actually

36:22.600 --> 36:24.600
play through it this time.

36:24.600 --> 36:30.600
You know, the reality is, you work, go to school, I work, do my hobbies on the side,

36:30.600 --> 36:33.600
so does, you know, Loki, and all you folks who listen.

36:33.600 --> 36:37.600
You're probably working right now, or school, or whatever it is you do.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.600
There is not always enough time during the day.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.600
And, you know, part of this show is that we don't claim to be the experts on every single

36:43.600 --> 36:44.600
game out there.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.600
And, certainly, there's those games we feel passionate about, but we're just like you

36:47.600 --> 36:48.600
guys.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.600
We're not getting paid to play games eight hours a day.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.600
If somebody wanted to do that, great.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.600
I mean, because, essentially, that's what you do when you visit those big websites,

36:55.600 --> 36:59.600
like, you know, I'm not going to name them, but the ones that are, you know, sponsored

36:59.600 --> 37:02.600
by magazine companies and things, you know.

37:02.600 --> 37:08.600
Keep in mind, like, just my next week, I'm going to school four nights next week, doing

37:08.600 --> 37:12.600
a CPR class, working on a website, working on art commissions, and working full-time.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.600
So, I mean, that's a standard week.

37:15.600 --> 37:22.600
You know, I, we don't get to have free time all the time to do all the stuff that we,

37:22.600 --> 37:25.600
you know, would like to do, you know, to play all the, all the games.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.600
And, you know, that's why- But when I do have free time, it's all about

37:28.600 --> 37:29.600
the games.

37:29.600 --> 37:34.600
Well, what I was trying to say is that that's why, you know, when we do the show, we actually

37:34.600 --> 37:38.600
come and tell each other so that we can each give each other the impression of what we're,

37:38.600 --> 37:39.600
you know, we're looking at.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.600
You know, what's quick and easy to play, what's going to be a little time consuming, what

37:43.600 --> 37:45.600
project's going on, that type of thing.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.600
And no more e-mail, by the way.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.600
Makes sense.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.600
Except I got some spam, which I deleted.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
I can say this.

37:51.600 --> 37:55.600
I got an e-mail, and I neglected to mention this during housekeeping, but I'll mention

37:55.600 --> 37:58.600
it next week so it's at the top of the show, because I know not everyone listens to the

37:58.600 --> 37:59.600
whole thing.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.600
But I do want to confirm that Orange Laundry is going to be back at Fauna Mae Con this

38:03.600 --> 38:08.600
year, which is being held from May 25th to May 28th at the San Jose Convention Center.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.600
At the San Jose Convention Center in California.

38:10.600 --> 38:11.600
So.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.600
Right?

38:12.600 --> 38:15.600
I'll be there for the weekend.

38:15.600 --> 38:16.600
Gotcha.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.600
Okay.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.600
The whole, I just found this out, too.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.600
Right.

38:20.600 --> 38:25.600
Dan's younger brother, his step-brother, is getting married the weekend before that.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.600
I see.

38:26.600 --> 38:29.600
So, I will definitely be there Saturday and Sunday.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.600
Yeah, yeah.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.600
Or Friday afternoon if I can at all manage it.

38:33.600 --> 38:37.480
Even though we might not be there from open to close, we'll be there definitely doing

38:37.480 --> 38:41.040
a live panel and taping a show live, like we did last year.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.480
And I will be cosplaying as Annette Renard now.

38:43.480 --> 38:47.080
I have no idea what I'm going to cosplay as, because I don't usually do cosplay, but we'll

38:47.080 --> 38:48.080
see.

38:48.080 --> 38:51.300
But regardless, cosplay aside, we'd love to see you guys turn out for the show.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.920
As I understand, one of our listeners, Rama, is coming out from the East Coast for this

38:53.920 --> 38:58.960
convention and has rented a fat hotel room, so it's going to be like a mini-OLR con of

38:58.960 --> 38:59.960
sorts.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.480
Fauna Mae Con is the sideshow.

39:01.480 --> 39:08.760
I definitely need to remake my Temari costume, because the last one that was made, it was

39:08.760 --> 39:09.760
too big.

39:09.760 --> 39:14.480
So, we'll have more details on our involvement with Fauna Mae as the event approaches, but

39:14.480 --> 39:18.200
that's really exciting, because we definitely are looking forward to bringing more video

39:18.200 --> 39:22.760
game type content to Fauna Mae, because I don't know a lot about anime, so I can only

39:22.760 --> 39:24.560
talk about video games.

39:24.560 --> 39:25.800
Maybe Jamie can do the anime thing.

39:25.800 --> 39:26.800
I can.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.000
I'm actually thinking about starting to watch Bleach.

39:30.000 --> 39:37.760
I watch Bleach when I pour it in the washer.

39:37.760 --> 39:38.760
Alright.

39:38.760 --> 39:45.760
Anyways, so, not having anything to do with Bleach or anime or anything like that, apparently,

39:45.760 --> 39:50.920
well, unless you lived under a rock or something, you probably didn't realize, well, Vista just

39:50.920 --> 39:51.920
came out.

39:51.920 --> 39:55.040
All 50 billion- OMG, it did?

39:55.040 --> 39:56.040
Yeah, really.

39:56.040 --> 40:01.240
I'm just rushing right out to go buy it, like I did with XP.

40:01.240 --> 40:09.560
But, if you happen to be gaming on a PC that has the parental control set on it, it might

40:09.560 --> 40:14.800
actually break some of your casual games, like games that use Wild Tangent.

40:14.800 --> 40:24.320
And according to your gamer, DirectX creator Alex St. John says, basically, that they tried

40:24.320 --> 40:30.160
making sure that it wouldn't break all the different games out there, they thought they

40:30.160 --> 40:35.640
covered everything, but unfortunately, Wild Tangent is denoted as spyware by the anti-spyware

40:35.640 --> 40:41.960
applications in Vista, and says, normally the software is generally harmless, but it

40:41.960 --> 40:48.240
does get installed without express- Isn't Wild Tangent the games that come with

40:48.240 --> 40:50.880
AOL Instant Messenger, because those games are spyware.

40:50.880 --> 40:51.880
I'm sorry.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.480
Yeah, I think so.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.480
Wild Tangent is spyware.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.480
So, whatever.

40:55.480 --> 41:02.720
I mean, it's not a huge deal, but just thought you might want to know, because there are

41:02.720 --> 41:05.160
some people that like casual games like Christopher and-

41:05.160 --> 41:08.840
Black Boy says, wow, Loki's News is old, they patched this already.

41:08.840 --> 41:11.280
Yes, it is old.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.560
And you know, it's just like, I don't care.

41:13.560 --> 41:18.080
But nevertheless, you know, isn't it funny that they rolled out an operating system and

41:18.080 --> 41:19.560
it broke half the games on it?

41:19.560 --> 41:23.560
I mean, why should I upgrade to Windows Vista, anybody?

41:23.560 --> 41:26.700
Would anybody like to tell me why I need to drop the money right now to upgrade to Windows

41:26.700 --> 41:27.700
Vista?

41:27.700 --> 41:28.700
I'm not going to.

41:28.700 --> 41:29.700
You should upgrade your computer, too.

41:29.700 --> 41:30.700
Because I don't- What?

41:30.700 --> 41:31.700
You gotta upgrade your computer, too.

41:31.700 --> 41:33.600
I don't understand why I need to upgrade right now.

41:33.600 --> 41:34.600
I'm not.

41:34.600 --> 41:38.240
I don't want to- This is all the more reason for me to just buy my iMac.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.360
Screw Windows.

41:40.360 --> 41:43.280
I mean, between the PC I have now and the Mac, I'm doing just fine.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.560
I don't need Windows Vista.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.560
What?

41:45.560 --> 41:47.700
You look like you want to say something smart-ass so bad.

41:47.700 --> 41:48.700
It's hurting you.

41:48.700 --> 41:49.700
That's fine.

41:49.700 --> 41:50.700
That's fine.

41:50.700 --> 41:51.700
You guys are fine with your Macs.

41:51.700 --> 41:52.700
That's great.

41:52.700 --> 41:55.320
I'm sure games will come to it eventually.

41:55.320 --> 41:59.680
I don't play PC games and the only PC game I play is World of Warcraft.

41:59.680 --> 42:02.400
And I have Guild Wars on my laptop so I don't have to worry about it.

42:02.400 --> 42:05.560
Jeremy Todd 1 says there's no reason to upgrade right now.

42:05.560 --> 42:06.560
Simple as that.

42:06.560 --> 42:09.760
Just upgrade in a couple years and there's actually a reason to upgrade.

42:09.760 --> 42:15.100
DDR Dollar Bill says Vista has had a lot of returns.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.100
So we'll see.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.100
Maybe later.

42:17.100 --> 42:28.160
I don't know how well it's running.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.600
I'm hearing it's got performance issues.

42:29.600 --> 42:33.040
But nevertheless, this is certainly something you're not seeing returned as often.

42:33.040 --> 42:37.240
It's World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade.

42:37.240 --> 42:40.440
You think people are World of Warcraft addicts here.

42:40.440 --> 42:45.480
You should check out China because the Nine released World of Warcraft locally for China.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.480
They got 3.5 million subscribers in China.

42:48.480 --> 42:51.600
So it's pretty big over there as well.

42:51.600 --> 42:52.600
Well guess what?

42:52.600 --> 42:56.960
Burning Crusade is also going to be coming to China, which I suppose isn't the most shocking

42:56.960 --> 42:57.960
news in the world.

42:57.960 --> 43:01.380
But maybe you didn't realize it wasn't already out over there.

43:01.380 --> 43:03.160
They're going to have to wait a little bit for this game.

43:03.160 --> 43:08.060
So Chinese localization is already underway for the Burning Crusade and the Nine is working

43:08.060 --> 43:14.200
closely with Blizzard to offer all the same support that Blizzard offers to the US customers

43:14.200 --> 43:16.320
and also the distribution and all that stuff.

43:16.320 --> 43:21.100
A quick quote here from Blizzard, quote, we're fully committed to ensuring that the ongoing

43:21.100 --> 43:25.040
operation of World of Warcraft in mainland China will provide an excellent experience

43:25.040 --> 43:27.160
for players there for many years to come.

43:27.160 --> 43:30.620
We look forward to extending that commitment with this expansion as well as with future

43:30.620 --> 43:32.160
Blizzard releases.

43:32.160 --> 43:36.040
So it sounds like if we get it here, you're going to get it in China from the Nine, even

43:36.040 --> 43:37.840
if it is a little bit later on.

43:37.840 --> 43:40.160
You have to just wait for all the localization and stuff.

43:40.160 --> 43:42.000
Like well, we have to do that for Japanese games.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.840
So it's only fair that that side of the world has to wait for us once in a while.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.760
Oh, and then they get the joy of patching.

43:48.760 --> 43:52.800
Yes, then you get to patch World of Warcraft seven times before you can play it.

43:52.800 --> 43:53.800
It's so much fun.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.800
And then it won't patch and then you have to download it and do it yourself.

43:56.800 --> 43:57.800
Cool.

43:57.800 --> 43:58.800
Anyway.

43:58.800 --> 43:59.800
Actually, can I suggest this real quick?

43:59.800 --> 44:02.040
XFire has a patching system built in that's actually pretty good.

44:02.040 --> 44:06.160
I have to say you wouldn't think I would usually endorse a program like XFire, but actually

44:06.160 --> 44:07.160
it's really cool.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.920
I really like XFire.

44:08.920 --> 44:12.200
I think that's a great little application, anyway, for a PC gamer.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.200
Anyway, sorry.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.200
We'll take your word for it, Rob.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.200
Yeah, please do.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.200
Okay.

44:16.200 --> 44:21.460
Speaking of MMOs, there is an MMO coming to the UK.

44:21.460 --> 44:23.200
It's called Two Worlds.

44:23.200 --> 44:28.880
It's being released on PC and Xbox 360.

44:28.880 --> 44:38.760
The good thing about it, it's a free roaming RPG that's the orc versus human deal.

44:38.760 --> 44:52.960
But the cool thing is that it has unique quests, a one-on-one arena battle, horse races, and

44:52.960 --> 44:56.840
customizable characters with no level capping.

44:56.840 --> 44:58.440
So that's pretty cool.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.200
I can truly be a god character in that game.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.720
I hear it's very similar to Oblivion.

45:03.720 --> 45:04.720
Yeah.

45:04.720 --> 45:05.720
Very similar to Oblivion.

45:05.720 --> 45:08.440
Jeremy Tell One wants to point out and clarify from what he's read about the game.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.160
The 360 version only has eight player multiplayer.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.400
Only the PC version is an MMO.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.160
Eight players is still not bad.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.160
That's still fun.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.880
That's still an OL army.

45:17.880 --> 45:18.880
And eight players.

45:18.880 --> 45:19.880
That'll be fun.

45:19.880 --> 45:21.920
Now, here's what I want to know, because I haven't really read up on much.

45:21.920 --> 45:26.880
I wonder if Crackdown is more than two players co-op, because that'd be awesome if you have

45:26.880 --> 45:27.880
like four people.

45:27.880 --> 45:28.880
Hmm.

45:28.880 --> 45:29.880
I don't know.

45:29.880 --> 45:32.840
I guess we'll see more when the game comes out, because if it's coming on 360, we'll

45:32.840 --> 45:34.320
probably get a demo.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.320
So who knows?

45:35.320 --> 45:36.320
Yeah.

45:36.320 --> 45:44.640
Anyways, so just like tons of stuff coming out now on the 360, including some brand new

45:44.640 --> 45:46.560
Xbox Live Arcade games.

45:46.560 --> 45:49.520
And they announced ten new games that are going to be coming out.

45:49.520 --> 45:51.340
Some of these we've heard of before.

45:51.340 --> 45:52.560
Some we have not.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.960
For example, 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.760
A little bit different than 3D Ultra Mini Golf.

45:57.760 --> 46:03.120
It was one of the Sierra Online games, which I loved, by the way.

46:03.120 --> 46:06.600
So that's going to become an Alien Hominid HD, which is kind of an HD upgrade to the

46:06.600 --> 46:08.600
original Alien Hominid game.

46:08.600 --> 46:11.320
Band of Bugs, which is supposed to be by Ninjabi.

46:11.320 --> 46:14.280
It's kind of a, I guess, a strategy game.

46:14.280 --> 46:15.280
It's kind of neat.

46:15.280 --> 46:16.600
Castlevania Symphony of Night.

46:16.600 --> 46:18.000
No big surprise there.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Catan.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Settlers Catan.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.120
Remember that was one that was remembered to be coming at some point.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.120
Eats.

46:24.120 --> 46:25.120
Chowdown.

46:25.120 --> 46:30.640
Kind of a different game, I guess, as a port of a PC title by the same name.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.780
Luxor 2, which should make Nelly happy.

46:32.780 --> 46:35.560
Another kind of Zuma clone type of thing.

46:35.560 --> 46:37.400
Paper Boy.

46:37.400 --> 46:38.800
Root Beer Tapper.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.360
Paper Boy and Root Beer Tapper are awesome.

46:40.360 --> 46:44.980
I know you guys bitch about the classic coin-op ports, but these are some true classics that

46:44.980 --> 46:46.280
are underrated, I think.

46:46.280 --> 46:52.740
And then my favorite of the list here, Worms HD is going to be coming out, and that's awesome.

46:52.740 --> 46:57.520
We used to have epic Worms multiplayer going on in my house.

46:57.520 --> 46:58.520
Worms is awesome.

46:58.520 --> 47:01.420
You know what's interesting though, and we neglected to say this in our coverage of Konami

47:01.420 --> 47:04.600
Gamer's Day, but did you notice they had nothing on Xbox Live Arcade?

47:04.600 --> 47:07.720
I was very surprised we didn't see Castlevania Symphony of Night on Live Arcade, because

47:07.720 --> 47:08.720
they had it at CES.

47:08.720 --> 47:13.440
I would have thought that's what they would have used their 360s for instead of showing

47:13.440 --> 47:14.440
Wii 11.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.840
That's kind of what I thought we were going to see too, but I guess not.

47:17.840 --> 47:18.840
That's alright.

47:18.840 --> 47:25.040
Alright, well, speaking of Xbox Live, Crackdown has shattered records on Xbox Live.

47:25.040 --> 47:30.140
You know it had a demo released, and it shattered the demos, or shattered records away from

47:30.140 --> 47:35.140
Lost Planet and Fight Night, the most downloaded demo for a 24-hour period, and the most downloaded

47:35.140 --> 47:41.640
demo during a seven-day period, and that's without Halo 3, you know, beta stuff.

47:41.640 --> 47:44.800
I don't know if people are maybe downloading this to see if it's worth it, if they want

47:44.800 --> 47:45.800
to do the Halo 3.

47:45.800 --> 47:46.800
It's fun.

47:46.800 --> 47:47.800
I've played the demo.

47:47.800 --> 47:48.800
I can play the demo all week.

47:48.800 --> 47:49.800
I couldn't get into it.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.300
I'll have to do co-op with somebody who can kind of show me what the hell I'm supposed

47:52.300 --> 47:55.320
to be doing, because I didn't get it, but I'm stupid sometimes.

47:55.320 --> 48:00.240
You can punch people, then throw them in the cars, and then throw cars on top of them,

48:00.240 --> 48:01.240
and then you can, like...

48:01.240 --> 48:02.240
I'll try it again.

48:02.240 --> 48:06.000
What's great, though, is they have achievements for throwing dead bodies into the air, then

48:06.000 --> 48:08.720
bouncing them off, or bouncing rockets off of them.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.200
I'll just have to come over and watch you play at some point, and see if it's worth

48:11.200 --> 48:12.200
it for me.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.200
It's so worth it.

48:13.200 --> 48:16.200
I swear I'm going to sign up for a game rental site or something this week, so I stop buying

48:16.200 --> 48:17.480
all this stuff new.

48:17.480 --> 48:19.040
We'll see.

48:19.040 --> 48:23.960
Anyhow, I guess that's all I have to say about Crackdown.

48:23.960 --> 48:32.680
Well, there is different games to be downloaded, especially Castlevania Symphony of the Night

48:32.680 --> 48:36.600
on Xbox Live Arcade.

48:36.600 --> 48:41.760
They were talking about the memory card coming out that was supposed to be 256 megabytes,

48:41.760 --> 48:50.880
but the pre-order on GameStop's website is 512 megabytes for the portable memory.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.920
So in other words, they give it a secret upgrade.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.680
Now it's 512.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.400
Or is it a typo on GameStop's end?

48:56.400 --> 48:57.400
What do you think, Loki?

48:57.400 --> 49:02.760
I haven't heard of anything official about them upgrading that, although I'm assuming

49:02.760 --> 49:08.560
that we'll find something new, or find out something about it pretty soon, if not at

49:08.560 --> 49:09.560
all.

49:09.560 --> 49:12.680
It seems kind of logical that would happen, though, right?

49:12.680 --> 49:13.680
Yeah.

49:13.680 --> 49:19.160
I mean, it makes sense, because 256, I mean, the price point for it was a bit more expensive,

49:19.160 --> 49:23.080
and I don't know why you'd buy a memory unit anyways.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.360
I mean, spend the extra money and just get a hard drive.

49:25.360 --> 49:26.360
That's what I say.

49:26.360 --> 49:29.520
Just get the damn hard drive, unless you really have a need to take that shit with you on

49:29.520 --> 49:30.520
the go.

49:30.520 --> 49:31.520
There's really no point.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.520
Exactly.

49:32.520 --> 49:36.360
So, yeah, no idea if this is official yet.

49:36.360 --> 49:37.360
I'd imagine...

49:37.360 --> 49:41.440
I don't think it's going to be a typo, because I think originally they had 256 on there,

49:41.440 --> 49:43.440
so they probably just got it updated.

49:43.440 --> 49:44.440
Interesting.

49:44.440 --> 49:45.440
I don't know.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.440
I'll keep my eyes out.

49:46.440 --> 49:47.440
Please do.

49:47.440 --> 49:48.440
Eyes and ears.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.760
I'll check them out.

49:50.760 --> 49:56.920
But anywho, so beyond the bigger memory cards, there is going to be another epic game coming

49:56.920 --> 50:05.240
to the Xbox 360, as well as PlayStation 3, Unreal Tournament.

50:05.240 --> 50:09.720
One unique thing about this, and I think we mentioned this back on an earlier show, they're

50:09.720 --> 50:14.480
going to be allowing mods to be used on PlayStation 3 and the 360 version, probably as well as

50:14.480 --> 50:16.200
the PC.

50:16.200 --> 50:21.160
Of course, they're also going to be including user-created mods as well.

50:21.160 --> 50:24.840
So that's actually kind of cool, that they're allowing mods on there, because I know there's

50:24.840 --> 50:29.480
been some pretty good mods available for Unreal and Half-Life 2 and stuff.

50:29.480 --> 50:34.680
It'd be really cool to see some of the stuff downloadable online.

50:34.680 --> 50:36.520
Although no idea when this game's coming out.

50:36.520 --> 50:39.720
I like the idea of user mods coming out online.

50:39.720 --> 50:44.160
I mean, the only time I can think of user-created content outside of an MMO that I've seen on

50:44.160 --> 50:50.840
like Xbox, it would be like DDR Steps on ultraMix 2 through 4, whatever, have those steps you

50:50.840 --> 50:52.380
could download online.

50:52.380 --> 50:57.800
So you don't see a whole lot of user-created content, so that's kind of cool, I think.

50:57.800 --> 51:03.760
Also what's kind of cool, a Flash-based computer game called N, which I used to play religiously.

51:03.760 --> 51:07.200
It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.520
Describe N. I've never played N. What is N all about, Loki?

51:09.520 --> 51:13.360
N kind of has a stick figure, like ninja type of character that you run around collecting

51:13.360 --> 51:14.360
the gems.

51:14.360 --> 51:16.440
Oh God, I've watched you play this game before.

51:16.440 --> 51:17.440
I know what...

51:17.440 --> 51:19.000
Okay, sorry, keep going.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.600
So anyways, it's pretty awesome though.

51:20.600 --> 51:24.960
You just run around and you collect stuff and there's like, as the levels go on it gets

51:24.960 --> 51:28.640
harder and harder and there's like missiles and stuff you have to dodge and you just have

51:28.640 --> 51:30.520
to make it through the time limit and stuff.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.000
I've totally seen you play this game before.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.200
Okay, now I know what it is.

51:33.200 --> 51:36.000
Well, N Plus is coming out on Live Arcade later this year.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Will you be buying that?

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Yes.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Alright, very cool.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.840
Of course, who knows how long it's going to get delayed because by this time we were supposed

51:41.840 --> 51:49.200
to see Castle Crashers, but not that we're bitter or anything like the rest of you.

51:49.200 --> 51:52.400
Alright, let's go to the website of the week.

51:52.400 --> 51:56.120
Every week Dark Sakura climbs the internet up and down and back and forth and finds a

51:56.120 --> 52:00.080
website suitable of sharing with the rest of you and we call it Dark Sakura's website

52:00.080 --> 52:05.000
of the week, a website for you to visit besides orangelaungeradio.com.

52:05.000 --> 52:13.960
So Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers this week besides orangelaungeradio.com?

52:13.960 --> 52:17.800
The website of the week is the Castlevania Dungeon.

52:17.800 --> 52:24.480
You can get there by going to castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com.

52:24.480 --> 52:28.560
I will be, of course, reposting the link in the chat room which I have actually already

52:28.560 --> 52:35.320
done once today because I was posting links to images of the original Rondo of Blood.

52:35.320 --> 52:42.000
But if you go into the site, it has write-ups on every one of the games.

52:42.000 --> 52:47.400
The first thing that you see is actually a big screen print of the updated Rondo of Blood.

52:47.400 --> 52:52.880
There's artwork, multimedia, emulation, fan fiction.

52:52.880 --> 52:53.880
It's really cool.

52:53.880 --> 52:58.520
I've actually been going on this site in upwards of eight years now.

52:58.520 --> 53:07.880
It really is the, I'd have to say, most in-depth Castlevania site ever and really I can't say

53:07.880 --> 53:09.040
good enough about it.

53:09.040 --> 53:11.160
It really is up there.

53:11.160 --> 53:17.640
In fact, this site actually, if Dan told me right, inspired his site that he used to have

53:17.640 --> 53:22.440
back in the day which was Neo Strider's Strider's Own, if you wouldn't ever remember that.

53:22.440 --> 53:23.440
Nerds.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.440
I did his graphics form.

53:25.440 --> 53:30.040
This was partly my site too, but Castlevania invention is just fantastic.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.640
Kudos to the folks that run it.

53:32.640 --> 53:37.720
You guys have been just keeping it awesome for years and so cool.

53:37.720 --> 53:38.720
So go there.

53:38.720 --> 53:39.720
Now.

53:39.720 --> 53:40.720
I mean, after the show.

53:40.720 --> 53:43.360
Why am I not surprised the Castlevania site made it for her website of the week?

53:43.360 --> 53:45.640
Well, it was going to be history.com.

53:45.640 --> 53:48.400
Now you just gave away what next week was likely to be.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.320
No, next week isn't history.com.

53:50.320 --> 53:53.080
I am completely shocked.

53:53.080 --> 53:54.080
Completely shocked.

53:54.080 --> 53:55.080
That's what I thought.

53:55.080 --> 54:01.120
Anyways, there was some other weird news that managed to leak out this week.

54:01.120 --> 54:07.880
This website, DVD Empire, they were making big news about exiting the video game business

54:07.880 --> 54:14.720
and apparently gave their top eight reasons why they are leaving the game business.

54:14.720 --> 54:18.080
Now most people are like, who the fuck is DVD Empire?

54:18.080 --> 54:23.360
Well the only way I've heard of them before is because, well a couple of reasons.

54:23.360 --> 54:29.840
One, they're the legit side of adult DVD Empire, which is big on adult movies.

54:29.840 --> 54:35.080
The other thing is we actually sell to them, or we did at one time I guess because now

54:35.080 --> 54:36.080
they're out in the business.

54:36.080 --> 54:42.320
But I just thought it was interesting some of the reasons that they mentioned that they're

54:42.320 --> 54:47.580
leaving the game's business because it actually doesn't make any sense.

54:47.580 --> 54:49.200
And I don't think a lot of sites are covering this.

54:49.200 --> 54:51.560
Well let me just real quickly go down the list.

54:51.560 --> 54:55.040
Number one, video game industry does not care.

54:55.040 --> 54:59.000
The video game industry only cares about the mass emergence like Toys R Us, Walmart, Best

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Buy, etc.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.640
They completely ignore the needs and wants of medium or small game retailers and below

55:04.640 --> 55:06.080
is how they do it.

55:06.080 --> 55:08.000
Well that's sort of true.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.960
I mean you're not going to be able to bring in a retail kiosk or anything like that if

55:11.960 --> 55:13.200
you're a small guy.

55:13.200 --> 55:15.600
You have to be doing a lot of business with them.

55:15.600 --> 55:19.560
They can't make money they say, which is funny because I have a lot of customers that do

55:19.560 --> 55:23.080
make money and lots of it, but whatever.

55:23.080 --> 55:28.360
You may not care whether or not we make money but we continue to pay to sell video games.

55:28.360 --> 55:31.120
Is impossible for us to make money selling video games.

55:31.120 --> 55:35.780
Video game manufacturers set the price using what they call MSRP and here's an example

55:35.780 --> 55:37.760
the video gaming industry greed.

55:37.760 --> 55:41.100
They set the retail price at $5 above product costs.

55:41.100 --> 55:43.880
Buy it for $54.99, sell it for $59.99.

55:43.880 --> 55:46.860
That is completely untrue.

55:46.860 --> 55:52.960
Their price, which I happened to after reading this, I looked it up, is way below that price.

55:52.960 --> 56:00.960
In fact, I think they were, at least for us, buying 6% or their discount was our cost plus

56:00.960 --> 56:02.040
6%.

56:02.040 --> 56:05.900
So they were actually paying 6% over what we paid for it.

56:05.900 --> 56:09.520
So they were still making tons of money on this stuff and there's never that type of

56:09.520 --> 56:11.920
margins on stuff at all.

56:11.920 --> 56:14.920
So I don't know what the fuck they're talking about there and they can definitely make money

56:14.920 --> 56:16.480
off of that stuff.

56:16.480 --> 56:20.400
They're also saying no price protection, games dropping price quickly.

56:20.400 --> 56:24.720
These guys used to buy one piece of different things at a time.

56:24.720 --> 56:27.820
So they wouldn't have a large inventory, that wouldn't even apply.

56:27.820 --> 56:31.840
No returns, that's all over the industry.

56:31.840 --> 56:33.120
They say distribution is dumb.

56:33.120 --> 56:38.280
I don't know who their rep was so that might be the case but they say basically that they

56:38.280 --> 56:40.480
get their product three days after street date.

56:40.480 --> 56:45.980
Well unless they are a big chain company, they won't get any product on street date

56:45.980 --> 56:50.400
because you have to be direct with the actual publishers in order to get stuff on street

56:50.400 --> 56:51.400
date.

56:51.400 --> 56:53.660
So they're just stupid.

56:53.660 --> 56:57.600
And better suited for brick and mortar retailers, that might be true but either way they're

56:57.600 --> 56:59.800
just bitching and moaning.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.800
Good riddance.

57:01.800 --> 57:05.920
Travis Donovan from our own Saturday Night Program here at Orange Lounge Radio says,

57:05.920 --> 57:10.160
I tried ordering from them back in 02 and it took three weeks to get my order and then

57:10.160 --> 57:13.680
it was wrong and then another month and a half to get what I ordered.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.040
All their games are now 20% off.

57:16.040 --> 57:21.640
I'm sure you were buying games and not porno, right Travis?

57:21.640 --> 57:25.360
The other thing too they were talking about here, there are some updates at the bottom

57:25.360 --> 57:27.520
of their little bitch page here.

57:27.520 --> 57:29.200
They have three different updates.

57:29.200 --> 57:32.800
One of them says, we knew about the low profit margins when developing our games division.

57:32.800 --> 57:33.800
Why are you bitching?

57:33.800 --> 57:36.640
Why did they put up a bitch page in the first place?

57:36.640 --> 57:37.640
It's so retarded.

57:37.640 --> 57:38.640
It's kind of a professional.

57:38.640 --> 57:39.640
It's so retarded.

57:39.640 --> 57:42.720
And then the other one, people responded to our news with, well your model sucked, you

57:42.720 --> 57:44.400
should have sold these games and accessories.

57:44.400 --> 57:52.560
Let me put it this way, there are retailers and smaller guys that sell a lot more than

57:52.560 --> 57:56.640
you guys do and sure as hell, I don't know if we were their only distributor, but if

57:56.640 --> 57:59.320
we were, they weren't buying anything.

57:59.320 --> 58:02.120
They weren't hardly buying anything.

58:02.120 --> 58:07.040
They are just really whining and get out of the business.

58:07.040 --> 58:10.720
Well one thing I'm sure will be successful no matter how it's delivered to folks would

58:10.720 --> 58:15.280
be a Katamari Damacy online game.

58:15.280 --> 58:16.280
Get this.

58:16.280 --> 58:22.120
A Japanese gaming site called 4Gamer has reported that the Korean publisher WindySoft is bringing

58:22.120 --> 58:24.320
out Katamari Damacy online.

58:24.320 --> 58:28.900
It signed a contract in November of 2006 and Cyberstep has already begun development of

58:28.900 --> 58:32.120
the game, a late 2007 release.

58:32.120 --> 58:37.040
The gameplay of Katamari Damacy online is kind of like the versus battle from PS2 and

58:37.040 --> 58:40.680
PSP and now it's going to be in an online arena.

58:40.680 --> 58:42.720
There will also be community management features.

58:42.720 --> 58:46.560
There's going to be pet and house elements collectibles.

58:46.560 --> 58:50.340
You also supposedly can make your own island and create custom clothing from the items

58:50.340 --> 58:52.520
you get while playing.

58:52.520 --> 58:53.520
Very interesting.

58:53.520 --> 58:57.080
Hopefully, we'll see this on the US side, but if not, I'm sure a lot of people will

58:57.080 --> 59:00.860
figure out how to play it nonetheless because there's always the cult of people who want

59:00.860 --> 59:03.640
to play those games.

59:03.640 --> 59:07.140
We would like to take this opportunity to welcome your phone calls at this time by opening

59:07.140 --> 59:08.760
up our Skype line.

59:08.760 --> 59:12.080
Our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

59:12.080 --> 59:14.580
That number is toll free in the United States and Canada.

59:14.580 --> 59:18.780
If you'd rather, though, or if you're in another country, you should call us on Skype.

59:18.780 --> 59:21.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

59:21.000 --> 59:26.420
You can get more detail by going to our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com and clicking on

59:26.420 --> 59:28.000
interact with us.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.360
So while we wait for some phone calls, do you have any last minute news, some real quick

59:31.360 --> 59:33.160
last minute news, anyone?

59:33.160 --> 59:35.400
Yes, real quick.

59:35.400 --> 59:40.080
A couple of things, there's some stuff being developed for the PSP, homebrew stuff.

59:40.080 --> 59:45.440
One of these is the Legend Zelda Quest for Link and actually looks kind of cool, kind

59:45.440 --> 59:50.040
of resembles the Super Nintendo Zelda, so if you want to check that, PSP Updates has

59:50.040 --> 59:51.680
the link for you.

59:51.680 --> 59:55.640
And then there's also one that looks like a cross between Zombies Ate My Neighbors and

59:55.640 --> 01:00:03.480
Biohazard 2 version 2.0 final has been released and yeah, it looks exactly like Zombies Ate

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.560
My Neighbors.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.120
All right, let's go to some calls.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.200
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200
Raven's Dolphin.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.800
Oh yes, you again, how are you doing Raven's Dolphin?

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.600
I just got something to tell you about all games and you.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.600
Okay, what?

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600
You sounded tired.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.480
Well, it was 9.30 when I finally got through.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.240
It was 12.30 when I was over here.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.600
You know what, as well as that there was a lot going on here at the house, so I was kind

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.680
of in my bedroom, like lying down, talking on the phone and what else should be said.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.060
Not to, again, I love all games, but their phone system, I don't know if it happens to

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:45.880
you when you call in, but you hear yourself echoing and it totally bugs.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880
Like I couldn't.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.880
Oh, I agree.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.880
It's not you.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.680
I couldn't hear anything they were saying, so it was tough.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.240
It hasn't always been that way because I've been on the show before and I didn't have

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.240
that.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.920
But anyway, is that all you wanted to say?

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.920
Yeah, two more things.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920
Okay, what else?

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.560
Sam & Max is great on GameTap, I've been enjoying myself with it.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.560
I freaking updated GameTap this week, meaning to play it, and then I got sucked into something

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.560
else.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560
I played one of their stupid arcade games.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.560
I know.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.560
I don't.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.160
Well, that too, but you know, some of the, because GameTap has like 800 games on it,

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.920
so it's like you go there, I'm like, oh, I'm going to finally play Missed Online or Sam

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.280
& Max, and then I'm like, holy shit, they put this game on there?

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.760
I've totally got to play that game.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.240
So I think it was like Rainbow Islands or some crap.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.240
I know, ADD.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.240
I know.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.240
You're ADD.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.240
Yeah, there it is.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.240
You know?

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.240
I do.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.520
I couldn't finish Hitman, and that made me mad.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.280
I wanted to finish it, and it made me mad.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.280
What else is on your mind?

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:42.640
Okay, I have to tell you about the Mario Kart 64 thing.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.920
I have to tell you why.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.960
Why the Save Ghost thing?

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:53.040
It's because the Wii, the emulator for the N64 doesn't realize that it's not an N64 before.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.960
It's running on a Wii, so it's thinking it's on an N64.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:02.000
That's what an emulator is, but it's thinking that it's an N64, and it's thinking that it

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.520
has an N64 pack in it, but it thinks it needs that.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.320
It needs that, but in retrospect, it doesn't have it.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.520
I kind of sort of was implying that when I said that in order to make it work, they would

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:19.040
have to go and recode the game itself, and that's a lot more than just trying to emulate

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040
it correctly.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.040
But you're right.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.360
They would have to recode the game to instead of looking for the memory pack, look for the

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:32.560
Wii's memory, and that's not something that's easily done with a ten-year-old game.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.920
I know that other emulated sites like Project, I'm not going to say the rest, but they got

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.400
through that, but the Wii, it's built up emulation.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.720
It's only going to pull what it thinks.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.680
The save states that are on the cartridge will work fine on the Wii.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.880
It's just those cartridge games might not.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.960
I do want to say this, though, I do agree that Nintendo definitely should use that patching

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.720
feature to fix some of these things.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.540
Not so much the ghost thing, I could care less about that, but I would just love to

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:08.400
see them give little bonuses, especially the multiplayer.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.520
Especially with the old-ass 8-bit games like Mario Brothers, how much more valuable would

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.760
games like that be if we could play those online?

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.760
Seriously.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.760
Just one more second.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:25.200
I thought the emulation was good on the N64, wouldn't you be pissed if you played Mario

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.800
and it was off one millisecond?

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.800
Yeah.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.840
Alright, that's all I have to say.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.200
I do want to say one other thing, though, about the emulation is that one thing, having

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.840
the widescreen HD and everything, I noticed that the Xbox 360 is smart enough to put the

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.140
vertical letterbox on my games when I'm playing something that's not widescreen, but the Nintendo

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:49.200
Wii is not, and I really wish it was, and that is not a very hard fix.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.400
And yes, I realize I could dig up the TV remote and switch it that way, but it's so much easier

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.200
when the system just does it automatically.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.600
I would love to see Nintendo make that little patch.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.000
You're right, and that's it.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.680
I want you to get another call.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:02.680
No problem.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.560
Thank you, Ravenstaufen, for your opinion, as always.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.360
He had his agenda tonight, and he has 123 agenda.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360
Bravo.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360
Good job.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.280
Welcome your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or the Skype line.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.680
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.680
Who's this?

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.680
Hey, what's up?

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.680
It's the Rob D.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.680
Hi, the Rob D. How are you doing?

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.680
Not too bad.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.120
Well, actually, I'm a little bit sad, but it has nothing to do with anything other than

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.200
the Super Bowl, so I'm from Chicago.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.640
We're not too big on the Super Bowl here, but I understand it was a big thing for folks

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.640
around Chicago.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:39.600
I know one of our lesbians is from the immediate area around there and is a big Chicago fan,

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600
so I'm sure...

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.720
I mean, she's in Wisconsin and is a Bears fan, so...

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.400
Didn't she have cameras or something?

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.960
I don't think so, but I was secretly rooting for the Bears for her sake, so I'm very sorry.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:56.200
I was rooting for the Bears simply because I was hoping they'd make another music video.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.200
Super Bowl Shuffle?

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.200
Yes, exactly.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.520
My favorite life in that is probably Now I'm As Smooth As A Chocolate Swirl.

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.660
But you have to admit, and without getting too much further into sports, you have to

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:07.320
admit that opening touchdown was hilarious.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.320
Yeah, definitely.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.320
Comedy gold.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.880
What's on your mind tonight, game-wise?

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.640
Well basically, I have to talk about the whole ghost saving thing with a memory pack.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640
Popular topic tonight, yes.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.640
What's on your mind?

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:22.040
Well, I disagree that it has to do with hacking the game itself or altering the game itself

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040
in any way.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.760
I think that the emulator could be programmed to emulate a control pack itself, an older

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.760
memory pack.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.760
I mean...

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.760
I suppose...

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.760
I don't know.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.960
I guess maybe I'm just thinking...

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.080
The reason why my brain goes there is I'm thinking maybe it's just simply the way the

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.680
data is written, or you're talking about different types of memory.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.680
I don't know.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.680
My brain...

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.200
For some reason, I'm thinking in my mind it has to be the game that's recoded.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200
I don't know.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.320
I wish Nintendo would be more open, but you know they're not going to tell us the specifics.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.360
Well, I'm just curious, since every PC emulator has figured out a way to get around save data,

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.760
it would only take a little bit of ingenuity to get around it on the Wii.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.880
I suppose.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:01.320
But unfortunately, the Wii is so locked down when it comes to hacking and all that stuff.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.480
It's got to be Nintendo who does it, and I honestly don't think they care enough.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.000
I think they just want to start cranking out more virtual console games for us to buy.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.160
I think they want to get working on Pokemon Snap and whatever else on the 64 they're going

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.160
to be bringing us.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.160
Ocarina of Time.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.160
All that crap.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.320
Yeah, it's not a big deal for Ghost Data.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.600
I never used it in the 64 version anyway.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.200
Yeah, I didn't have a memory pack, so it's kind of a moot point to me.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.880
I'm like, oh, well that's too bad I can't save Ghost Data, but then again, I'm barely

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.400
playing this as it is because I have such bad gamer ADD.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:37.160
The other thing I'd like to comment on, though, is since Final Fantasy VI comes out this week

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.760
for the Game Boy Advance, I think that's a great thing.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.080
I love Final Fantasy VI.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.440
It's my favorite Final Fantasy game ever.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:48.760
Terra's theme is quite possibly my favorite piece of music from any game.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.080
The opera is one of the best scenes in video games.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:59.520
It could be the best scene, but the opera scene is possibly the best scene in video

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.940
game history, period.

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.760
When I went to the More Friends concert a couple years ago before E3 and they reenacted

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.640
that thing, like they had the actual opera singers, just chills.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:12.520
Even though the rest of the concert had sound glitches galore, that part was phenomenal.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.520
Phenomenal.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:19.720
But why haven't we seen a remake of Chrono Trigger?

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.960
Didn't they touch it on the PlayStation 1 at least?

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960
They did.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:23.960
Final Fantasy Chronicle.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:24.960
Yeah.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.360
You know, it's kind of like, why doesn't Nintendo do a new Kid Icarus?

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:33.680
It's kind of like, it squares little franchise that they're just kind of waiting for the

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.420
right time on, I suppose, to really wow us with something.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.420
But yeah, that is kind of interesting.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.000
Why haven't we seen a Chrono Trigger type game on the PS?

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.600
I wonder if the other part of it isn't Toriyama's stake in it.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.600
Maybe.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:51.320
Toriyama is a really big name in art in Japan, so it could possibly be his own stake in it.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:56.120
Yeah, but what other RPG could it give me to care about an anthropomorphic frog?

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.720
True.

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.760
Maybe they'll add one in Final Fantasy 6.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.760
Battle Toads.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.720
Hey, what happened to Battle Toads vs. Double Dragon?

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.400
Battle Toads was too fucking hard.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.400
Everyone gave up on it.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.260
Yeah, it took me forever to get through, but I did actually view that game, but that's

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.260
a different story altogether.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.320
That's all I had to say, so I'll leave you to the rest of the show.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.320
No problem.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.080
Thanks so much for your insight, Rob D. We've been enjoying your chat comments tonight.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.080
Thank you.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.080
All right, take care, buddy.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080
You too.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.080
Later.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.120
All right, let's go to another call right here on the line.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.360
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.360
Who's this?

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360
This is Brad from Pod Culture.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.360
Hey, Brad from Pod Culture.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.360
Hi.

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.360
How you doing, buddy?

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.360
Howdy.

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.600
I'm short, I'm fat, and I'm going bald, but other than that, okay.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.560
Well, real life sucks, but that's okay.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.960
That's why we have the internet.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.280
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.720
Not a whole lot.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.160
Just got a wee this week.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.160
Wee!

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.360
I see your username comment says this, too.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.360
Wee!

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.360
And I apologize.

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.720
I got your message about the friend code, but I've been so horrible at adding it.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.360
I have like four people I have to add, so I will add you, I promise.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.640
Rob's not as bad as me.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.640
I've got like ten people waiting.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.640
I have a queue.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.120
That's no big thing.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.320
I'm more interested in playing with the me's more than anything else.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.640
I will send you my doctor.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.680
I will send you the goat say me.

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.680
Somebody made me.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.680
It's disgusting.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.680
It's brilliant.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.680
Oh, Lord.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.680
I have Michael Jackson and the doctor.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.980
I think it was SSJ100Matt made it.

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.240
It's a goat say me.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.240
It's hilarious.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.840
That's so wrong on so many levels.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.840
But funny.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.240
Anyway, what else is on your mind regarding the wee?

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:29.320
Well, I got the Mario Kart 64, downloaded that today, and not only that, the problem

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:34.240
with the ghost data, I was having problems with plugging in my GameCube controller and

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.240
using it.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.920
Oh, because those games are optimized for the Wii Classic controller.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.400
I haven't tried the GameCube controller.

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.720
What were the problems you were having?

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.640
It's like the A button wouldn't work.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.640
And I know it's not the controller.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.440
I played that, played a NASCAR game on it the other day.

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.640
Oh, boy.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.160
Well, do you think it's going to be worth shelling out the money for a Classic controller

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.760
to get the optimized experience?

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.440
Which I went and did.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440
Did you really?

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440
Yeah.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.120
And did it play a lot better for you?

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.600
Other than the fact that that controller itself sucks.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.560
You don't like the Wii Classic controller?

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.560
No.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.040
What is it about it you don't like?

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.840
I guess I'm being used to the Xbox controller or PlayStation.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.760
It's just the way that it fits in the hands.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760
I see.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.240
It is a little – the thing that weirds me out about the controller is all the buttons

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.760
on the top of it.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.440
Like there's an L button, an R button, and then like a little Z, and these other little

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.440
nubs on it.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.320
And I'm like, there's too many buttons.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.040
Is it me or is the A and B buttons reversed from what they normally would be on the controller?

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.560
I think they're right, but sometimes if you play a lot of Japanese games, they're

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.360
usually backwards, and so that can kind of mess with you.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.280
It just seems like it's in a weird place.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.280
Yeah.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.960
And then what else was – oh, NintendoManiac64 says a Classic controller is needed for Super

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960
Nintendo games.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.840
I'd agree with that, because the GameCube had that funky layout for the buttons.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.040
I beg to differ.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.960
You don't – you use the GameCube controller on Super Nintendo games?

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.640
The Hori pad.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.920
Hori made a GameCube controller that was in the Super Nintendo layout.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.400
Oh, so you're not really using a GameCube controller.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400
I get it.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.400
Okay.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.280
If you're using a Classic controller, you've still got another way to do it.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280
Okay.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.280
I didn't even think about a third party GameCube controller.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.840
And the fact that the Hori pads came out in the U.S. at major retailers, so.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.440
Oh, there you go.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.080
Good insight, DarkSucker.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.360
All right.

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.080
So what other games have you been playing on your Wii, Bryce?

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:36.680
I downloaded Super Mario Brothers and – what the hell else was the other one I downloaded?

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.680
I downloaded two of them.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.680
Isn't it funny how you download all these games?

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680
R-Type.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.800
Are you going to download R-Type for Jamie?

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.800
She sends me the Wii points.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.800
You know what?

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.600
I'll go get you a Wii card if you promise me the first thing you download is R-Type.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.600
Oh, sure.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.000
You send me a Wii card, I'll download anything you want.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.520
Just wait until after I make my next school payment and I'll do it.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520
Wow.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520
Look at this, guys.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.520
Call in tonight.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.520
Jamie's giving away free Wii points.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.920
Only to my fellow Whovian.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.480
All right.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.480
It's like a contest.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.240
There's something nice about Dr. Who and Wii points.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.800
Send those emails to mailbag at orangefundstradio.com.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.400
I will send Wii points to whoever gets me a David Tennant signature.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.400
How's that?

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400
Oh, there you go.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.480
Actually, I could just do that with an envelope, but still.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.200
There you go.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.240
Zappy in our chat says, I love Dr. Who.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.240
Give me.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.240
All right.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.240
Brad, anything else on your mind tonight?

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.240
Yeah.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.120
The DOA movie actually doesn't suck.

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120
Really?

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.120
See, all I've heard is really negative things about it.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:40.080
So what – now, I know you reviewed it on your own program, but in a nutshell, what

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.000
were your thoughts on it?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.160
It's complete popcorn.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.880
There's not a whole lot of – I mean, it's all substance, but are all –

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.200
All style, no substance?

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.200
Yeah.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.200
Yeah.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.520
Well, I mean, it's a fun summer movie kind of thing.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.000
It's just fun.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
It's not –

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.080
So it's like – it's one of those movies where, like, turn your brain off for two hours

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.160
and just kind of be a mindless zombie and it's not so bad?

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.160
Oh, yeah.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.160
All right.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.160
That's cool.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.840
Why do you think it bypassed theaters?

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:17.760
I really don't know because I've paid 10 bucks to see movies that are 10 times worse

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.760
than that.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.760
That's true.

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.820
I did pay to see Lady in the Water.

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.840
Did you have the life – or is it – I'm sorry.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.440
Is it true in Dead or Alive movie that they have, like, life bars and the announcer in

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.440
it?

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.440
Yeah.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.020
Was that – that sounds cheesy.

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.020
Was it cheesy?

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.680
It's very cheesy in some places, yeah.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.160
Oh, well, I suppose you don't go see a Dead or Alive movie expecting Oscar-caliber Judi

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.540
Dench acting-in-it type content, although it would be kind of funny if Judi Dench was

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.280
in Dead or Alive, don't you think?

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.280
I don't –

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.280
What?

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.280
Forget it.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.280
No.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.280
Not funny.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.280
All right.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.800
Well, yeah, I hope they go to your program and check out the full review of Dead or Alive.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:01.800
All right.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:02.800
All right.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800
Well, Brad, thanks so much for calling in tonight.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.160
We've got to go to another call, but take care, buddy, okay?

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160
Later on, man.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.160
Peace.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.160
All right.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.160
A little mini movie review here on Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.640
Let's go to one more call.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.640
Hi.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.640
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.640
Who's this?

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.640
Hey.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.640
Shadownextgen in chat.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.640
Hi.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.640
Shadownextgen in chat.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.640
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.600
I apologize if you guys talked about this earlier as I was late to the show because

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.600
of the Super Bowl.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.600
All right.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.680
A lot of people have that excuse tonight, but try me.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680
What's up?

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:37.600
Do you guys have any idea about what Konami's, quote-unquote, earth-shattering news tomorrow

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.360
is going to be?

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.360
You know what?

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.840
We didn't bring this up, but I had read somewhere that they have earth-shattering

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.840
news coming on Monday.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.840
It's on their own website.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.840
Yeah.

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.840
They're advertising tomorrow.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.840
Earth-shattering news.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:55.400
And I saw that get picked up on Kotaku or Destructo or one of those sites.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.920
No, because they didn't tell us what it is on Thursday.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.240
I can guarantee you we talked earlier in the show about we weren't allowed to say some

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.800
things for some time, but I can guarantee you everything that we were allowed to say

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.800
has been said now.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.880
Here's the earth-shattering news.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.960
Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming soon.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.880
I have a feeling it's probably about one of the games we didn't see, like where was

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.400
the Metal Gear Solid 4 info.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.440
You know maybe that's it.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.360
Maybe it's the Metal Gear Solid release date because don't you remember her saying

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:27.880
something like, well, we want to give you the release date, but can we do that?

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.880
No.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.280
Didn't she kind of do that kind of thing?

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.840
Wasn't that how she was teasing the release date?

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:36.800
Or was she just smoking a bowl?

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.440
Doesn't she remind you just a little bit of what's-her-name from Nintendo, the parent

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.440
Kaplan or whatever?

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.440
I don't know.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:48.160
But anyway, I would say if it's that earth-shattering, it's the Metal Gear Solid 4 release date,

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.880
new trailer, something like that.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.240
Something that missed Konami Gamer's Day for whatever reason.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:16:01.600
A lot of people are thinking it's maybe Konami's confirmation of MGS4 on the 360.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.000
I have a feeling if that's going to happen, it's going to be a window where it's

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.320
going to be on the PS3 for six months and then it'll come out on the 360.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.760
It might be like Virtua Fighter and just be Blade.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.880
Yeah, that's essentially what I'm getting at is that it might be one of those things.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.760
Because I'll tell you what, Sony needs that so bad right now.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:28.520
And you can kind of tell that Konami's really backing the PSP more than almost anyone else.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.600
Konami is doing what they can for Sony.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.180
So they still are in the business of making money, but I have a feeling they're going

01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:36.640
to give at least a window.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.160
I would not expect that to be tomorrow's news.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.160
But I could be wrong.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160
That could be it.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:44.600
But I have a feeling you're going to get tomorrow the release.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.320
Unless it's something stupid, like remember the time when the guy got a lot of crap for

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.840
this, but Joystiq had this big announcement at one o'clock about what Nintendo's doing.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.480
Yeah, and it turned out to be just some chip thing.

01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.120
If it's not something stupid like that, I would imagine it's the Metal Gear Solid

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.120
release date.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120
Oh my God.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:08.400
Big kudos to the Rob D. Metal Gear Solid 4 will star Sub-Zero instead of Raiden.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.040
I see what you did there.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.040
Funny.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.480
Well, what do you hope it is, Shadow Next Gen?

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.360
Personally, like I said, I'd like to see Metal Gear on the 360.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.720
That would probably be for me.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:27.360
That way, one less reason for me to shell out $600.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:30.800
It would be bad news for Sony if that is what they announce tomorrow.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.640
Do you think Sony ought to just throw in the towel at that point?

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:39.280
What can Sony do if they're about to lose Metal Gear Solid to the 360?

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.760
I really couldn't tell you.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.960
Well, for one thing, they can start listening to their community like Microsoft does.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.960
Good idea.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:51.680
It seems like they keep telling us what we want instead of listening to what we want.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.680
That is true.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.460
They don't have anything quite like Major Nelson.

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.460
You got to give that to Microsoft.

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:59.840
I mean, Microsoft is by no means perfect, but at least they do have their outlet with

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:00.840
their community.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.240
You got to admit, though, Nintendo doesn't really listen to people either, but somehow

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.240
they get away with it.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.520
No, they don't, but I think they do a little bit better.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.840
But yeah, they could do better in that area as well.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:16.680
We seem to forgive Nintendo because they kind of at least deliver a little more than Sony

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.360
seems to have been recently, I think is what it comes down to.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.600
Well, I think, personally, I think the reason why Sony has gotten so much f**k over the

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.820
past year is just their PR.

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:29.020
If they wouldn't have said half of their stupid comments, they'd probably be in a much better

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.020
position right now.

01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.020
I would agree with you there.

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:36.160
Like the time when people will buy a PS3 even if there are no games for it.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.080
I guess that's true.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.160
Well, we will see what that announcement is, and we'll talk about it next week.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:45.840
So shout out next year, and I'm hoping you'll call us back next week and let us know about

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.840
the news, whatever it is.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.840
Yeah, all right.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:48.840
Jump through, guys.

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.840
All right.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.840
Take care, buddy.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.840
Have a good one.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.840
Yeah, you too.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:53.840
Later.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.840
That's going to do it for tonight's Skyline.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.960
Thank you so much to all our people calling in, and I apologize if we didn't get to your

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:58.960
call.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.880
We were getting hammered a lot there towards the end, but we just got to keep things moving.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.800
We're running a little late tonight, so we are going to go ahead and start to wrap up

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:07.800
the show.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.800
Any last minute stories, guys?

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.800
Yeah.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.800
All right.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.800
Yes, Loki.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.800
A few things.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.800
There's going to be a brand new wipeout.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:14.800
I know.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.800
This is a surprise.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:21.480
Brand new wipeout coming to the PS3 and PSP, and it actually looks pretty good.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:25.960
They have some screenshots up on that, you know, looks very similar to the other wipeout

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:26.960
games.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:32.840
Apparently, Microsoft is bringing Project Silphied over here for Square Enix, so they're

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.000
going to be publishing it stateside.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.480
I'm very much looking forward to that one.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.560
So we'll see the next-gen shooter on 360 soon.

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:46.520
Rumors are that according to Famitsu, Resident Evil 5 is delayed to 2008.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.120
I definitely believe that.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.120
Let's see.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:57.000
Another rumor here, and this apparently was actually coming from, I want to say Bungie.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.840
Yeah, actually it was from their last Bungie update.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:04.440
They were saying that you'll be able to modify the gravity in, I believe, multiplayer games,

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.840
so you can reduce the gravity to 50%.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.840
Oh boy.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.840
Jump even further.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.360
Hooray for low gravity games.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.360
You all know that's coming.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:15.280
Can I give some quick chat room comments to the last phone call here?

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:18.560
NM64 says, Skye, I think Nintendo surprised their fans.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.600
Sony tells fans what they want.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.620
The Rob D says, that's because Nintendo doesn't act like arrogant jerks and piss all over

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.800
our memories when they don't listen to us.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.760
Black Boy says, Nintendo totally doesn't listen to the consumers.

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:31.760
Let's see.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:36.240
Hitstun says, Konami announces Boktai game for PS3, yeah.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.200
You have to drag your PS3 out into the sun.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.000
It might cook itself.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:47.160
Bandit says, breaking news, Konami's tears can cure cancer, if only it was able to cry.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.400
How random.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.880
How ripped off from the Chuck Norris.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:51.880
Yeah, I get it.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:52.880
I get it.

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:53.880
Yeah.

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:59.340
Anyways, there was also another rumored list of titles coming out for the Wii.

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:05.600
This is supposedly from the new Game Pro issue, the March issue.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:11.880
On the list, we have 100 Bullets, which is supposed to hit in the fall, Alive, which

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.440
is being done by Ubisoft.

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:18.240
Remember, that's that one girl game thing that's supposed to make you cry and stuff.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240
Oh, yes.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.240
Oh, yes.

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.360
I remember that.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.000
A new Devil Kings game, which is very similar.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.640
It's Capcom's kind of Danksy Warriors type of game.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:34.240
A new Digimon game, DK Bongo Blast, I guess, is now coming out for the Wii.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.800
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, not a big surprise.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:40.400
Iron Man the movie game coming out in 2008.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.480
Kirby, a new Kirby game, 2007, I guess fall.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:47.760
Legend of the Dragon, I know Legend of the Dragon is coming out.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:53.040
Lost, they're supposed to be doing the game this year on that.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:58.840
Ratatouille, I know that's coming out, and that's actually not fall listed on here.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:04.720
Mario Kart for the Wii, Pilot Wings for the Wii, I don't believe that, but I guess we'll

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.040
see.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:12.500
A new Wii shooting game and some new Wii Sports, Wii Motor Sports, they're going to have that

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:15.000
airplane game that was shown in E3.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:22.240
Wii Music, which is supposed to come in October, TNA Impact, Jawa, which I have no idea what

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:28.600
that is, Space Station Tycoon, Dance Factory, Animal Crossing, Raid Over the River, which

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:39.640
actually looks pretty awesome, that's also coming out of the DS, and Sadness, we'll see.

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:42.880
Jamie's still on the Castlevania kick, and now she's trying to get me into it too.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:47.280
Sorry, I found a YouTube thing where someone has uploaded apparently the entire run of

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.280
the game.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:51.040
Real quick, because I know this makes for awesome radio, I wanted to show you, Rob,

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:56.480
a game I liked, I know you like Burnout, well this is another game, Flatout, they have the

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:02.920
first screenshots for Flatout Ultimate Carnage on xboxside.com, so I thought you might want

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:06.960
to check this out, because it looks very similar to Burnout, and it looks very good.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.440
Wow, that's very pretty.

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.760
It's like Burnout, but you can launch your driver through the windshield.

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:14.160
That is great, I'm going to so play that.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.160
Hooray.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.160
Yeah.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:20.640
Alright, any other last minute news, Loki, Dark Sakura, anyone?

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.600
Rondo of Blood is the best.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:23.600
Really?

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.600
Yes.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.600
I never knew.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:29.160
I guess that means we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.720
I do want to say this, I usually don't tease what's coming up next week on the program,

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.840
but next week, we have a juicy exclusive for you guys.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.240
One of our listeners, and I trust this person, has laid eyes on the script for the Alice

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:49.880
movie, and we are going to be divulging a lot of details on the Alice movie that you're

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:53.980
not supposed to know about right here on the program next week, so stay tuned for that.

01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:55.800
That's your teaser for next week.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.440
In the meantime, that means that's it, end of show.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.960
Thank you guys so much for tuning in, supporting independent radio, supporting Orange Launch

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:02.960
Radio.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.960
You guys are awesome.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:04.960
We love you to bits.

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.140
Loki, your final thought tonight?

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:13.360
My final thought is I'm completely done with Microsoft's retail training.

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.440
At least I'm caught up.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:19.920
By the way, chat room, yes, that is American McGee's Alice that we're talking about.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.720
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:29.600
Richter Belmont, I'm sorry, Richter, I actually got a really freaking busy week ahead of me,

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.840
so just, I need energy.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.480
My final thought is I want ice cream so bad right now, it hurts.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.000
I have ice cream.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.160
I want Baskin-Robbins or Cold Stone or something.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.240
I'm never eating it in and out again, by the way.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.240
Why?

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.240
Did you read the nutritional content?

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.240
Yes.

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.120
Yeah, that's a good way to stop eating fast food like ever again.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.160
I love their fries, the 400 calories for all those tasty, beautiful potatoes.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.560
I can just make them at home in the oven and then they're like 200.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.560
All right.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.360
You're going to cut up a potato and put it in the oven?

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.360
Yeah, I could do that.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.360
That's not bad.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:03.360
All right.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.360
That's it, folks.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.960
We'll be back next week with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.880
