00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:26,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, February 4th, 2007, first-hand accounts of the newest Konami games from their Gamers Day event, Denver Live goes straight from theaters to video to the internet, and did Windows Vista break your favorite PC games?

2
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:36,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,174
[SPEAKER_03]: This is episode number 218 for this February the 4th of 2007.

4
00:00:41,856 --> 00:00:47,322
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:48,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo.

6
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:49,344
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Jamie Summers?

7
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:50,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing.

8
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:51,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

9
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Been an interesting week.

10
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an interesting week.

11
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:55,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could say the same.

12
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:56,637
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a very interesting week.

13
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:57,578
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into that in a minute.

14
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello as well, though, to Tech Master Loki.

15
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:00,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

16
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:01,742
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

17
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:02,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good.

18
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:04,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have an interesting week as well?

19
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:06,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

20
00:01:06,648 --> 00:01:06,928
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

21
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:10,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for those of you that are new to our program, we just want to say hello and welcome.

22
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:16,741
[SPEAKER_03]: We were lucky enough to have a story of ours on the front page of Dig this week, so we're thinking we might have got a couple new people thanks to that.

23
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:20,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lawn Radio, a big howdy hello to you.

24
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:23,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for choosing to support independent podcasting, first off.

25
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:30,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And just so you know, we're a show made up of three friends who have kind of become friends to each other just through doing this program.

26
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:36,186
[SPEAKER_03]: We sit here and we talk about games every week, and the way that you would sit down and talk about

27
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:37,374
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:57,626
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes we're not always going to break the news.

29
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to talk about it and give you our viewpoints on it.

30
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:01,810
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dedicated to giving every gamer a voice.

31
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do that partially through our chat room as well.

32
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:05,413
[SPEAKER_03]: A big hello to the chat room.

33
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:11,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining us at chat.orangelandradio.com when we tape live here on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

34
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Also we have our Skype line which we'll open up later in the program.

35
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,925
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also an 800 number you can give us a call at and share your thoughts.

36
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:18,786
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll open that up later.

37
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:20,628
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way all you guys have a voice.

38
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:27,492
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and of course tonight they're talking a little bit in chat room about the Super Bowl, which is going on right now.

39
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:35,098
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess between the three of us, we kind of don't really keep tabs on what's going on in the Super Bowl.

40
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:39,481
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say the Puppy Bowl was awesome, and I'm kind of sad I missed the kitty halftime.

41
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:41,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy Bowl is kind of boring.

42
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:44,385
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Puppy Bowl is cute because they have the bowl cam.

43
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:45,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the bowl cam.

44
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:45,605
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

45
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:47,507
[SPEAKER_03]: They need like a Madden for puppies.

46
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:49,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

47
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking the puppy bowl would be something like that, and it wasn't.

48
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cute, but it was just three hours of cuteness.

49
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:28,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sitting in here working on some last minute things for the show, and I just hear out in the living room, DarkSakura, my roommate going, That was your roommate, that was not me.

50
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,041
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was you.

51
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It was both of you.

52
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:40,970
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

53
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on my ass in this chair playing Tech and Dark Resurrection on PSP.

54
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:50,795
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to get Dancing Blade because I played the old one and that was pretty cool.

55
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:54,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually did not play any Cooking Mama this week.

56
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:58,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you in a 12-step recovery program?

57
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:03,031
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm in a, oh my god, my midterms are next week type of thing, so.

58
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:05,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been studying muscle groups.

59
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:09,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I guess if I went back and played some, you know, Trauma Center, I'd be okay for class.

60
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:12,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Or something.

61
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:19,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I loaned out my copy of Trauma Center to a friend of mine who just got a Wii, so I'm sorry to say I don't have my version for you to practice on.

62
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,561
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a fun game.

63
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:22,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So fun.

64
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the Trauma Center version.

65
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:30,227
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've actually gotten pretty good at some of it, but it's still frustrating.

66
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, can't I just rub them until they're better?

67
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:34,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

68
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,014
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really been it, though.

69
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:38,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

70
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:44,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I played more of the Crackdown demo, like another three or four times yesterday.

71
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:45,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that game.

72
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:47,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't wait for the full thing to come out.

73
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:57,150
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's one of those games that I was like, well, you know, because everyone was saying, oh, it's kind of the demo, they didn't like the demo or anything like that originally when I was first hearing about it.

74
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of like, well, you know, I don't know if I'm going to like this.

75
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:04,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like it better because you can actually explore a lot more of the city.

76
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:15,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, you know, I did climb to the top of the tower in the middle of the city, which is fun, difficult, and a little bit, you know, a little bit of,

77
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,546
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

78
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:55,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool, kind of reminds me of NBA Jam a little bit because, you know, the players are doing stuff that you would normally not see anyone doing in basketball.

79
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,456
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty fun.

80
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:00,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a game I'd be picking up, but, you know, definitely a fun game.

81
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:05,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish NBA Jam would just come back, you know, because NFL Blitz is kind of lame.

82
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:08,920
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but NBA Jam was definitely one I could get into.

83
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,081
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was a lot of fun.

84
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:10,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was.

85
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:14,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I still love the old NFL Blitz, but this Blitz League shit's retarded.

86
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:17,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Some comments from chat room regarding your comments on Crackdown.

87
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:21,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, The grenade launcher in the Crackdown demo is so freaking awesome.

88
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You can literally just keep blowing everyone up with a single button push.

89
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Flying, flaming people equals automatic 10 out of 10 score.

90
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Mystic Gohan wants to know, how did you get up there?

91
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:32,622
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I get up there?

92
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:33,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Climbing.

93
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:37,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, it's just climbing.

94
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:38,748
[SPEAKER_02]: There's...

95
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:43,050
[SPEAKER_02]: If you keep climbing up the side of the building, you'll eventually get to this part where it's kind of flat.

96
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on one of the ends of the three towers, they have scaffolding.

97
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:50,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you jump on the scaffolding, you can kind of make your way up a little bit more.

98
00:06:51,557 --> 00:07:00,245
[SPEAKER_02]: But you really need to have at least a third level on your jumpy and stuff in order to be able to reach some of that.

99
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:02,127
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can get pretty high.

100
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:05,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fun.

101
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:08,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even more amazing, too, when you get that high.

102
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,851
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still see all the cars and people walking down below.

103
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:15,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's pretty amazing compared to Saints Row, which you wouldn't see any of that stuff.

104
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:17,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff would be glitching out and stuff.

105
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:19,614
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't wait.

106
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:22,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for Saints Row 2, whenever the hell that comes out.

107
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:26,057
[SPEAKER_02]: But Crackdown, that's going to hold me over for a long time.

108
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold you over to what?

109
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Grand Theft Auto?

110
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:29,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're waiting for?

111
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:30,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, Grand Theft Auto 4.

112
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:31,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

113
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:32,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

114
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,967
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, oh, I played Luminous a little bit.

115
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:42,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some more achievements playing the time attack stuff, and I think that's all I played.

116
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:43,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.

117
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:44,413
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

118
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:51,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my gaming week wasn't too thrilling because I'm still in my world of Warcrack mode, so I'm still playing there with the guilt.

119
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:52,893
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLandsRadio.com

120
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

121
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:48,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a film on there that one of my friends had seen that said I'd probably like called Hard Candy, which I decided to download in HD just because I wanted to see how was the HD delivery and everything.

122
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:52,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, the movie itself was kind of weird.

123
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:57,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess it was good for like the first 40 minutes and it was just like WTF and it was kind of gross.

124
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,259
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway...

125
00:08:58,632 --> 00:08:59,973
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

126
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:27,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you download the movie to your hard drive, you have 14 days to start watching it.

127
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:31,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you press the play button and start watching it, you have 24 hours to finish it.

128
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:36,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, you know, if I'm going to sit down and watch a movie, that was certainly ample time for me to finish it.

129
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:39,058
[SPEAKER_03]: But just so you know before you download any of that stuff.

130
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:42,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Picture quality, because I downloaded in HD, was pretty good.

131
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if HD gives me anything that much more than DVD does.

132
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:49,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, it's a little crisper.

133
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the colors stick out a little more.

134
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:53,164
[SPEAKER_03]: But is it worth...

135
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,146
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

136
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,531
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't having the slowdown problems that the store did when it first launched.

137
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:31,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, I guess maybe the curiosity factor settled down a lot and things, it's easier to get in there and download movies now.

138
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:38,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would recommend if there's a movie on there that interests you, you want to see how it looks, download one, try it for yourself, why not?

139
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:55,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I also downloaded for free because it was for free for a couple days the first episode of the Sarah Silverman program which was hilarious but the audio is off a little bit because we also taped my roommate taped it on the DVR and then I was like oh we can download it it'll be like perfect quality and while the video quality was great the sound was off

140
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:56,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

141
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:21,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to the chat room and seeing what the folks are saying there in the chat room.

142
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:22,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

143
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackboy says, God, Shelly Winter is in HD.

144
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:27,924
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not the old-ass Poseidon Adventure.

145
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:28,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the new one.

146
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,106
[SPEAKER_03]: What did the new one have in it?

147
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:32,508
[SPEAKER_03]: It had... What was that guy?

148
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:35,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in... God, I can't even remember his name.

149
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's the guy that's Snake in Revenge of New York or whatever?

150
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's Kurt Russell.

151
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Kurt Russell's in it.

152
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:43,337
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.

153
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:45,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike W. says, Rob is a movie snob.

154
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:47,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe a little bit.

155
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:47,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

156
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:51,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike W says, Rob only plays Xbox Live Arcade.

157
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, lately that's what I've been playing.

158
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:58,064
[SPEAKER_03]: There hasn't been a whole lot released on disc that I've wanted to play, but I enjoyed Heavy Weapon.

159
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:58,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Luminous.

160
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:01,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the Xbox Live Arcade games.

161
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:04,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I like those little, I don't want to say throwaway games, but the little like...

162
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:07,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have gamer ADD.

163
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:14,136
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've listened to this show long enough, you know that I never stick with one game for a long time, with the exception of the few MMOs I've played.

164
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:17,119
[SPEAKER_03]: And even then, I quit and go back and quit and go back all the time.

165
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Xbox Live Arcade games are perfect for me.

166
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:23,964
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do want to check out Fusion Frenzy, which is kind of the same thing.

167
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:28,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 40 minigames in one, but it's an actual release game as opposed to Xbox Live Arcade.

168
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:32,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm definitely looking forward to some of the Xbox Live Arcade news we have coming later in the show.

169
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:34,787
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

170
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:03,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunday nights at 6 o'clock or our rebroadcast on All Games, which is currently Monday at 5.30 Pacific and 9 a.m.

171
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:06,495
[SPEAKER_03]: on Tuesday Pacific time at AllGames.com.

172
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I hear those times might be changing in the near future.

173
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,298
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll let you know the details when that happens.

174
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:12,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we have a MySpace.

175
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:24,005
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a MySpace, if you want to come join us where the Internet goes to die, MySpace, the antichrist of the Internet, it's MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

176
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:24,226
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

177
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,101
[SPEAKER_07]: We have another community.

178
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have our LiveJournal community.

179
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:29,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And what else?

180
00:13:30,262 --> 00:13:30,923
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I forgetting?

181
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:32,003
[SPEAKER_03]: DeviantArt?

182
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a DeviantArt community?

183
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,905
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a few communities, thankfully.

184
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:35,945
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a DeviantArt community.

185
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:36,666
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Frapper.

186
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:37,446
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Frapper.

187
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:40,207
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our forums, too.

188
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:42,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I already plugged the forums.

189
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:42,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, fine.

190
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:43,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, then I'll plug them again.

191
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,410
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeSongsRadio.com Use them!

192
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,891
[SPEAKER_07]: My God, people, it's not hard.

193
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:49,332
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

194
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:51,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And we read them and respond a lot.

195
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I have more posts on the forums than anybody.

196
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably Loki and DarkSakura are up there, too.

197
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:56,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Not me.

198
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:57,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Not you?

199
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:59,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't you participating in the forums, you hypocrite?

200
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a hypocrite.

201
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:02,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm babysitting.

202
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:02,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I see.

203
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,031
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's get into some gaming news.

204
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:06,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to start it off.

205
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:14,256
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned at the top of the show, we were very lucky to have our coverage of Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party hit dig this week.

206
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:16,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you guys very much for giving us a dig on there.

207
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:21,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we reported, we were lucky enough to attend Konami Gamers Day earlier this week.

208
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll tell you more about it.

209
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:23,322
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

210
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:52,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people expected the DDR was going to come to the Wii.

211
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a matter of time.

212
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:54,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you.

213
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't expecting to hear it this early.

214
00:14:57,012 --> 00:15:02,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I kind of thought we would see it maybe... Like, doesn't it seem still early in the Wii's life for us to be getting this game?

215
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:03,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

216
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:04,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

217
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:04,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

218
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:04,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

219
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:06,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised at the timing of it.

220
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:12,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we wouldn't hear anything about it until at least E3, if not 2008, but it looks like we are getting it this year, at least according to the press release.

221
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:14,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, probably because there's not going to be another PlayStation 2 version this year, I would think.

222
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:15,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

223
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,692
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't show one off, so that would imply that, but I don't know.

224
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:28,358
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff they didn't show off at Konami Gamers Day, so they didn't say anything about Metal Gear Solid 4, except kind of cock-tease us with a release date and then not say anything.

225
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,839
[SPEAKER_03]: That was stupid.

226
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,060
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew.

227
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming soon.

228
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that's such a rough thing.

229
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:34,943
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew we all wanted to know it.

230
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:36,495
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

231
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that might leave it to a much bigger announcement coming up later.

232
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, so you think Silent Hill 5 is worthy of a press conference all on its own.

233
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:12,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

234
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:13,782
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

235
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,651
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

236
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:39,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting, the little demo.

237
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, of course, it's on the Wii.

238
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:08,952
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to wonder, how's the Wii Remote going to be used?

239
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, you use the Wii Remote in the game.

240
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:18,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I think this is more of a concept build, what we were looking at at the show, because it basically looked like DDR Supernova, but blue.

241
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:25,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And then every so often, an arrow would be replaced with this little icon that kind of looked like the Wii Remote and then unchecked next to each other.

242
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:25,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like a pause.

243
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:28,183
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still really experimenting with what the Wii thing is going to do.

244
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:50,010
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I want to mention something I didn't post anywhere on the site.

245
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Since Jason Enos was there, I took an opportunity to ask him a couple questions.

246
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:56,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked him, I said, So how about DDR in the Arcade?

247
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:58,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you want to say about DDR in the Arcade?

248
00:17:58,553 --> 00:18:00,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, of course, didn't really have anything to say.

249
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:05,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, What about that rumor there's an expansion coming to Supernova with, you know, the 2030, 203 or more songs?

250
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:07,537
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he didn't know anything about it.

251
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:09,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Which could be the polite way of saying no comment.

252
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:10,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

253
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:15,320
[SPEAKER_03]: But rest assured, those rumors that you've seen floating around the other DDR sites...

254
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason says you don't know about it, so that's what I'm going with.

255
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:19,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll trust him.

256
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:36,176
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting, though, is I was reading there are some rumored release dates, and I haven't heard anything about this yet, but that stupid Codemasters Dance Factory game was going to be coming to the Wii in March before DDR.

257
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:36,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.

258
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:42,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, I can tell you right now the game's going to be ass, just because the last one was ass.

259
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at some comments from chatroom.

260
00:18:44,987 --> 00:18:48,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, Silent Hill Origins is now the next Duke Nukem Forever.

261
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:48,729
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I hope not.

262
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaded says, Silent Hill, there won't be a 5.

263
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt that.

264
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:54,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are big words.

265
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:55,432
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 sold pretty well, didn't it?

266
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:56,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see why there wouldn't be a 5.

267
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:01,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Rama says, DDR Supernova 2, In The Groove, Dream On.

268
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:02,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream On.

269
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:03,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

270
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been following the Bomani scene for a long time.

271
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:09,658
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Groove songs are not coming to DDR.

272
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:17,620
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't have any insider knowledge to back that up, granted, but just having followed Konami and the Bonnie series as long as I have, it's not happening.

273
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop getting your hopes up about it, because you're going to be disappointed.

274
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not happening.

275
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:25,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Once that ruling passed, In the Groove was officially dead.

276
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:29,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, away from that, back to DDR on the Wii, because that's what we really want to talk about.

277
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,800
[SPEAKER_03]: What I thought was interesting is the selection screen.

278
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,041
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use the Wii remote to point and click at songs you wanted to play.

279
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had a cute little DDR arrow icon.

280
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:38,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

281
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all temporary right now.

282
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:41,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure.

283
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:41,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.

284
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:42,723
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think, Loki?

285
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:43,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you actually got to play it.

286
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:45,964
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think actually playing the game?

287
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:48,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it feel right?

288
00:19:48,405 --> 00:19:49,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it weird?

289
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:52,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like DDR hands and feet mode.

290
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:54,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

291
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:08,245
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you supported the eye toy.

292
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,827
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to have a hands and feet mode in that.

293
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:16,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, the thing is, though, if they do something like this, they could do some really interesting stuff with it.

294
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:20,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, instead of, you know, have a whole section of the song that's all done with your hands.

295
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:21,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that might be kind of cool.

296
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:26,338
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Jason was kind of implying, that they might want to do things where you do different motions.

297
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, he referenced Saturday Night Fever, like the disco pose.

298
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there might be a symbol that you have to do that kind of pose.

299
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,764
[SPEAKER_06]: They could do, like, what was in...

300
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:35,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Samba de Amigo

301
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:45,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, it's still way too early.

302
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:45,955
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

303
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than we know that there's DDR with possible stuff.

304
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:56,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say, though, when I played it, I thought it did feel like it played a lot like hands and feet mode because none of this extra stuff was in there.

305
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:57,903
[SPEAKER_03]: But I felt it was a lot cleaner.

306
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:01,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the problem I have with the iToy is the device just sucks.

307
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:05,208
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not in the exact right lighting, it doesn't work.

308
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:06,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not Konami's fault.

309
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the iToy sucks.

310
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:10,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I've not played one...

311
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:13,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Good thing with the eye toy, not one.

312
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:18,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to have the exact right lighting to make it work, and it never is right on DDR.

313
00:21:18,197 --> 00:21:24,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you have a house where you can get it to work every time, but the nice thing about playing this on the Wii was that it worked every time.

314
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:32,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you don't have to have the perfect white background in your house to get the Wiimote shaking to pick up.

315
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:36,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I liked about it, and it didn't matter where my hands or feet were, I could kind of do it wherever.

316
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,269
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of fun.

317
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:38,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

318
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:44,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had fun with it, and it certainly posed a... I mean, I was struggling on medium-level difficulty songs.

319
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:49,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So it certainly adds a whole new challenge to it, which I'm sure the purists will not be happy about, but...

320
00:21:50,837 --> 00:21:56,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I did find it interesting, though, that all the dance pads were just the GameCube dance pads.

321
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:08,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, in speculating that DDR was going to come out on the Wii, I wondered how they were going to do the wireless pad without lag, and it never occurred to me, duh, just use the GameCube pads, because there's GameCube controllers on the thing, and it looks like that's what they're doing.

322
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:14,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what, in the trailer, you could see clearly that even the non-Mario pads they used in the trailer were just plug-in

323
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:16,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

324
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:38,055
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're going to have a mode in this where you actually talk to each other and you have to do the same pose at a certain part in the song.

325
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:40,216
[SPEAKER_03]: They know they want that in one type of mode.

326
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:45,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to communicate with each other and say, okay, we're going to disco, we're going to disco, we're going to sprinkler, Roger Rabbit, I don't know, whatever.

327
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be interesting, I think, if nothing else.

328
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:51,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Also free play mode and workout mode.

329
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,560
[SPEAKER_03]: No sign of edit mode, but I don't see how you couldn't have a DDR right now without edit mode.

330
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't see why that wouldn't be coming for those that want to edit the Wii things into it.

331
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's way early.

332
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:01,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably just a technical issue for right now.

333
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:04,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to see more on it, we even have some pictures.

334
00:23:04,643 --> 00:23:08,706
[SPEAKER_03]: We took some pictures of the trailer, which hasn't come out anywhere else yet.

335
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:10,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a picture behind the scenes there.

336
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:14,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see Jason demoing it for some girl from some unknown press site who's giggling over it.

337
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,290
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see all that on our site.

338
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:20,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the only picture of the interface as it is now.

339
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:21,634
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's going to change.

340
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:22,655
[SPEAKER_03]: The interface is going to change.

341
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:24,296
[SPEAKER_03]: That was obviously a temporary interface.

342
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:27,858
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's all at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to see more information on that.

343
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:31,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki, what else did you see at Konami's Gamers Day that you enjoyed?

344
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:35,170
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually quite a few games there and I got to try a little bit of everything.

345
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:44,777
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first games I tried was Time Ace, which in the preview kind of reminded me of Time Pilot because you're playing in kind of different time periods and you're flying planes and stuff.

346
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:45,218
[SPEAKER_02]: The game...

347
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:49,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Itself actually reminded me, the graphics remind me of Prop Cycle.

348
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you remember that old arcade game.

349
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I freaking love Prop Cycle.

350
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:55,362
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like one of the most underrated arcade games ever.

351
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminded me very much of that.

352
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't you big on Prop Cycle, Jamie?

353
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:02,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked at an Amcor arcade when it came out.

354
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Prop Cycle's a bomb, man.

355
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,346
[SPEAKER_03]: You fanned yourself when you played it.

356
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:06,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I played it for free so much.

357
00:24:06,507 --> 00:24:07,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Prop Cycle.

358
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:08,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

359
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:14,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, but the game kind of reminds me of that, at least the level that they had you try out, where you're kind of playing this biplane thing.

360
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Time Ace, Time Pilot,

361
00:24:37,771 --> 00:24:41,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, both of them are bi-playing games where you're fighting in different time periods.

362
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,495
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems logical to me.

363
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:44,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

364
00:24:44,476 --> 00:24:47,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, for some stupid reason, did not make that connection.

365
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:48,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

366
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:51,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought that's what they were doing.

367
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:52,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong.

368
00:24:52,682 --> 00:24:57,246
[SPEAKER_02]: They could just be coming up with something that's almost identical and has almost the same name.

369
00:24:58,266 --> 00:24:58,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

370
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:03,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Another game I did play, though, was Coded Arms Contagion for the PSP.

371
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you, having played the first one...

372
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:09,623
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not good at all.

373
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:38,662
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, unfortunately, a problem with the system.

374
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:40,622
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game itself looks pretty good.

375
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:42,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's okay.

376
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:44,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't have very much fun with it.

377
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:47,584
[SPEAKER_02]: But what can you say, I guess?

378
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:50,965
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're used to playing first-person shooters on the PSP, then great.

379
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:51,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you want to check out.

380
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:56,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a good thing that they didn't do the random levels like they did the first one.

381
00:25:56,627 --> 00:26:00,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it kind of reminds me of a Metroid Prime type game.

382
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:01,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

383
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:05,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Dewey's Adventure, I know we saw the video of that.

384
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:06,365
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked okay.

385
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:09,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of reminded me of Kirby a little bit, actually.

386
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:11,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminded me of one of their own titles.

387
00:26:11,668 --> 00:26:14,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminded me of the Kororimpa.

388
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:15,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say that.

389
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:16,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Kororimpa?

390
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Kororimpa.

391
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say that word.

392
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminded me of Kororimpa.

393
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:21,183
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

394
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:44,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But he can't really do anything else.

395
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting the way you change the temperature and it's supposed to change the environments completely.

396
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:56,401
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually shake the controller certain ways to cause earthquakes or to cause wind and stuff like that.

397
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:58,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of unique for a platform game.

398
00:26:59,262 --> 00:27:06,950
[SPEAKER_03]: When they were about to announce Dewey's Adventure and they were showing the trailer and everything and they didn't tell us what the name of it was yet, didn't you think we were about to see Elebits 2?

399
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because... I totally thought that's what was coming.

400
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:12,475
[SPEAKER_02]: The cutscene for the artwork is exactly the same.

401
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:13,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly the same.

402
00:27:13,836 --> 00:27:14,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same style.

403
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:17,820
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the same people that did all the arts in Elebits to do this game.

404
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:20,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like it's in the same universe.

405
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:23,266
[SPEAKER_02]: It even had glowing creatures that were small.

406
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:23,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like...

407
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:26,804
[SPEAKER_02]: All they're doing is remaking Elebits all over again.

408
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I give Konami props for original stuff.

409
00:27:59,936 --> 00:28:01,477
[SPEAKER_03]: with that and Elebits and everything.

410
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:06,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how easy would it have been to just ported Castlevania to the Wii where you use the Wii as the whip?

411
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:07,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoop-de-doo!

412
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,300
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming up instead with original things for the Wii, which I think is kind of cute.

413
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,701
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want a Castlevania game where you use the Wii as the whip.

414
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:14,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we all want that.

415
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:15,782
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need it right now.

416
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:17,623
[SPEAKER_03]: We have this other Castlevania thing to look forward to.

417
00:28:17,643 --> 00:28:18,463
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about it in a minute.

418
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:19,524
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need another 3D Castlevania.

419
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:20,124
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

420
00:28:20,224 --> 00:28:22,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Castlevania 64 still burns a little bit.

421
00:28:22,945 --> 00:28:25,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, now, we have 3D Castlevanias that aren't that bad.

422
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:27,426
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not that good either.

423
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:29,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Castlevania 64 made my soul cry.

424
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:33,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to Symphony of the Night, everything since looks like poop.

425
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:33,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

426
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Compared to freaking Rondo of Blood, everything is poop.

427
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:38,813
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get there in a minute, sweetie.

428
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:39,754
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get there in a minute.

429
00:28:39,774 --> 00:28:44,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Symphony of the Night was great, but it wasn't a true Castlevania in my opinion.

430
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:52,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like Metroid featuring the Castlevania characters.

431
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:59,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying it was a bad game, it's one of my favorites ever, but it was Metroid featuring Castlevania characters.

432
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:03,911
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was like the best thing I've ever played, one of the best games I've ever played in my life.

433
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:12,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, I think the best video game ever made, I don't know how many times I've said this on the show, but I think the greatest video game of all time is Super Metroid.

434
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,462
[SPEAKER_03]: and so of course I love Symphony of the Night.

435
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:55,645
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was kind of cool definitely a lot of detail in there and it was kind of cool you can go around ripping heads off of little demons and throw them at them and stuff like that and the entire environment was pretty destructible so I think it definitely looks like a better game definitely a lot better than their last brawler that came out so it should be good

436
00:29:56,648 --> 00:29:57,988
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one, Wing Island.

437
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:05,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Wing Island on the Wii actually could very well be, you know, a sister game to Pilotwings.

438
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:09,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it pretty much is Pilotwings from what I've seen.

439
00:30:09,812 --> 00:30:14,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, once again, kind of the same art style as, you know, Prop Cycle.

440
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Very simple graphics, but it's fun.

441
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:25,136
[SPEAKER_02]: You play, you know, a squadron of biplanes and you do a bunch of different missions from fighting lost cows to delivering, you know,

442
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:35,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at chat trying to answer some questions.

443
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:41,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis Donovan for Prez in 08 asks, How did Rob get an Elebit for his 360 gamer picture?

444
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:48,202
[SPEAKER_03]: You're seeing a lot of people on Xbox do this now and it's all thanks to the Xbox webcam and the way I got an Elebit is that

445
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:49,543
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

446
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:14,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a Mario Kart as my background because you can import themes from pictures on your computer.

447
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:19,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you can do fun little customizable things with your 360 that kind of make you go, what?

448
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't bothered.

449
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have Perfect Dark.

450
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:24,381
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

451
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:30,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one that the public sees, I can't... Because, you know, you only see the camera pictures if you're on the friends list.

452
00:31:30,383 --> 00:31:31,743
[SPEAKER_03]: But what do I have?

453
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:34,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I just have one of the Pac-Man ghosts or something.

454
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:35,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I change it almost all the time.

455
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:36,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I change it like every week.

456
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:37,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

457
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:38,507
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like my MySpace.

458
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:40,768
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to change it all the time to keep it current.

459
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:41,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, look.

460
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you have Pac-Man background on your phone.

461
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:46,271
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a downloadable thing.

462
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you pay money for that?

463
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:49,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was bored.

464
00:31:50,093 --> 00:31:50,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Loser.

465
00:31:50,634 --> 00:31:51,814
[SPEAKER_07]: When I'm bored, I buy stuff.

466
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:53,676
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, like most women.

467
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:54,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

468
00:31:55,317 --> 00:31:56,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, hey.

469
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:57,738
[SPEAKER_03]: You're mad because it's true.

470
00:31:57,758 --> 00:31:59,139
[SPEAKER_07]: You stopped that right now.

471
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:04,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, hey.

472
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:06,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got a bottle thrown at me.

473
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:10,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I have a heart.

474
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,721
[SPEAKER_03]: It bleeds for you.

475
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:28,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's going to be our first Castlevania game that we have on the PSP.

476
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's interesting is that, you know, elements of it are new, but it's still kind of an old game.

477
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:40,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what the Dracula X Chronicles are is that you're going to have this old game, Rondo of Blood, which they said has never been in the U.S.

478
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:41,523
[SPEAKER_03]: before.

479
00:32:41,904 --> 00:32:42,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Never!

480
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:54,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't, but I can't stop thinking about Castlevania V. You know, even though that game was ass, I mean, really, that game was like the worst Castlevania game they ever made next to 64.

481
00:32:55,018 --> 00:33:02,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, but in Japan... Actually, I would rather play Castlevania 64 than Castlevania V. In Japan, by the way, it was released as Dracula XX.

482
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:03,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

483
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:11,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so, so, they kind of, but I mean, after you got past the first stage, a lot of it was different, so it wasn't really the same game, but in a way it was.

484
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:12,027
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway.

485
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:12,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm watching the trailer.

486
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:15,808
[SPEAKER_03]: That's as much as we got of Rondo of Blood previously.

487
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:19,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now we are going to get not only the classic Rondo of Blood game on the PSP.

488
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,191
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

489
00:33:37,944 --> 00:33:38,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I think so.

490
00:33:38,744 --> 00:33:38,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.

491
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:39,485
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hot.

492
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:39,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.

493
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,606
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hard to hear sound in there.

494
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:45,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you remember, though, the show where I brought in my Turbo Duo.

495
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,648
[SPEAKER_03]: That was before we were podcasting.

496
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:48,089
[SPEAKER_07]: And hope you got to play it on air.

497
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:49,150
[SPEAKER_03]: That was in like 2003 or 2004.

498
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was a few years ago.

499
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember that.

500
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:53,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll bring it back one day.

501
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:56,398
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it was a sexy game.

502
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:57,199
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks great.

503
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:01,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, love, love the 2D with the 3D look.

504
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the best thing I could compare it to is like if you played Super Smash Bros.

505
00:34:05,263 --> 00:34:12,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Melee and you've played that mode where you like actually are in the Mario game, but it's like all 3D-ified even though it's 2D.

506
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:15,048
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they did to Rondo of Blood in this enhanced mode.

507
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:15,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

508
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:16,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Instant...

509
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Impressed Points for me.

510
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:22,833
[SPEAKER_07]: The game mechanics are the same as 2D.

511
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can do the backflip.

512
00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:26,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just that, I was checking the timing of the moves.

513
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:28,977
[SPEAKER_07]: They're exactly the same as the PC Engine.

514
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:35,422
[SPEAKER_03]: It did play a little weird from the Castlevania games I'm used to, but I understand that's because the controls handled a little different back then.

515
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:40,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, something you have to remember, since this was before Symphony of the Night, you cannot just go anywhere you want.

516
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,686
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little more like Castlevania 3.

517
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:43,507
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real Castlevania.

518
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:44,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Castelvania 3 Castelvania 3

519
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:13,536
[SPEAKER_07]: and a lot of people who were wondering who Maria was, who didn't know any better, she was actually playable in Rondo of Blood if you rescued her.

520
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:17,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of her attacks were kind of stupid and cutesy little girly attacks.

521
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:23,543
[SPEAKER_07]: But they were also based after the four gods of Chinese mythology, which I thought was pretty funny.

522
00:35:23,723 --> 00:35:26,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they redid the graphics for the Uber attacks in this game too.

523
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:28,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it's nice.

524
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:32,169
[SPEAKER_07]: If you play the Saturn version though, she has those same attacks.

525
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:33,363
[SPEAKER_07]: DRACULA X CHRONICLES

526
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:49,737
[SPEAKER_03]: But they tease the idea that they might add new areas.

527
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:52,017
[SPEAKER_03]: They're thinking about going back and retooling that game.

528
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:55,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm theorizing, why not give us the Saturn version?

529
00:35:55,598 --> 00:36:00,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I realize, you know, you can't really port the Saturn, but give us what the Saturn version had with Maria and that whole scenario.

530
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,760
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

531
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the extra familiars.

532
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,341
[SPEAKER_07]: For America, it would be...

533
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:12,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be, you know, an addition because, of course, we didn't get the Saturn version.

534
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And as for the extra familiars, they were useless.

535
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:17,549
[SPEAKER_07]: They took them out for a reason, and I'm pretty glad that they did because they were stupid.

536
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,311
[SPEAKER_07]: All it was was another one of the same thing that you already had.

537
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:23,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, the item crash is hot.

538
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:27,214
[SPEAKER_03]: RavensDolphin says, I thought DarkSakura would be more excited about this.

539
00:36:27,694 --> 00:36:34,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, when she first found out, I think I had to hold the phone about 10 inches away from my ear because I was going deaf.

540
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:36,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going deaf from the squeaking.

541
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my copy while we were doing the show, remember?

542
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:41,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had gone to Anime Expo and, to put a long story short

543
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:07,835
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend Krista owed us money for our hotel room so she came back from Japan with a copy of Dracula X for me and called it even.

544
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:10,382
[SPEAKER_07]: She owed us about $120 and gave us the game.

545
00:37:39,581 --> 00:37:42,322
[SPEAKER_03]: All the honeycombs around the one that you hit.

546
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:44,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's kind of like how the puzzle works.

547
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,143
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to make lines of solid colors.

548
00:37:46,503 --> 00:37:50,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of those easy concept, but repeat playability.

549
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:54,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there was no sound, so it was hard for me to judge, does it have good music?

550
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is this game called Honeycomb Beat?

551
00:37:56,747 --> 00:37:58,807
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't really look like the music plays into it at all.

552
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:02,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I think beat is just what they call tapping the screen to flip all the things over.

553
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:06,390
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think if the price is right on this game, it could be a really good value buy.

554
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

555
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:47,115
[SPEAKER_03]: All the actions on the top screen, but when you pause the game or you tap things on the bottom screen, not only does the bottom screen show you the old arcade how to play banners, which I think is great.

556
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:52,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Those old things you used to see, like when you press the button, your thing will fly or whatever it is.

557
00:38:52,479 --> 00:39:01,046
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also flip the top screen so that you can play in brain training style mode, where you're holding the DS vertically.

558
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:08,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So for a more vertically oriented game like Puyen, it works great, because you don't really stretch the screen like you do if you're trying to squish it into the more horizontal.

559
00:39:09,091 --> 00:39:10,812
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought that was a really smart idea.

560
00:39:10,912 --> 00:39:20,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be a pretty good value, although granted, if you're an Xbox 360 owner, a lot of these games you've seen on live, or probably will be seeing on live a little later.

561
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,141
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of those same games, but you get them on the go on the DS.

562
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:28,352
[SPEAKER_03]: The next one I played is the game I can't pronounce.

563
00:39:28,472 --> 00:39:30,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Kororinpa.

564
00:39:30,754 --> 00:39:31,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddammit, Kororinpa.

565
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:32,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Kororinpa.

566
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Kororinpa.

567
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:35,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Kororinpa.

568
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:37,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Marble Mania on the Nintendo Wii.

569
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:40,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you remember those old things they had back when we were kids?

570
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:48,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Like those little marble mazes where you would turn the knobs left and right to move the marble around, but you didn't want them to fall in the holes like you tried to get it all the way to the end?

571
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:50,045
[SPEAKER_03]: That's this game.

572
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:54,628
[SPEAKER_03]: You tilt the Wii remote to tilt the grid around.

573
00:39:55,029 --> 00:40:01,073
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you could say in that sense, it's kind of like Marble Blast Ultra because there's, you know, like things that get in the way.

574
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:07,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one round that we played had these giant scissors that closed on the course and you didn't want your ball to be in there.

575
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, your ball could be all the, it could either be a little steel ball.

576
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:13,824
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be like a soccer ball, a basketball or a little penguin ball.

577
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:15,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, that's the one I had to play with.

578
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:16,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

579
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,614
[SPEAKER_03]: so that was that game and then Brooktown High was the last thing I played on the PSP and uh

580
00:40:54,005 --> 00:40:56,507
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

581
00:41:18,288 --> 00:41:19,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

582
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:47,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

583
00:41:56,758 --> 00:41:58,059
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

584
00:42:20,293 --> 00:42:22,595
[SPEAKER_03]: They had booth babes there promoting Brooktown.

585
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:26,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really the only thing they kind of went out and did all these little cheers.

586
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:31,301
[SPEAKER_03]: They really went all out for promoting that particular game at the show, which I thought was interesting.

587
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:32,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, DarkSakura?

588
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally cosplaying Annette's outfit.

589
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:37,386
[SPEAKER_03]: What, from Castlevania?

590
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:38,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

591
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:40,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having nothing to do with what I just said.

592
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:41,649
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm sorry.

593
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:45,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I was still looking at... They had some of the promo art up on GameSpy.

594
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:46,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's fine.

595
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:49,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the Brooktown a little bit.

596
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:55,886
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, the only thing that's disappointing is having played all the hentai, you know, dating sims out there.

597
00:42:58,387 --> 00:43:01,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, I did like, and I hope... What, you wanted to see 16-year-old Titty?

598
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:02,410
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gross.

599
00:43:02,611 --> 00:43:16,281
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I hope, I hope it had in the game, because they, did you notice in the trailer, they had kind of, you know, all the, you know, symbols for sex, you know, in there, like the rocket taking off and like the, you know, the...

600
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:20,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, the trailer!

601
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:32,980
[SPEAKER_03]: They did this weird-ass thing in the trailer where suddenly pictures of the game were replaced with these real-life imageries of a flower blooming and a rocket taking off and all this crazy stuff.

602
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that, like, you know, if you go in for a hot coffee or something like that, you know, that...

603
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:41,158
[SPEAKER_03]: This is gonna be really random, but did you see the new Psycho?

604
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:43,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, remember when Gus Van Sant remade Psycho?

605
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:46,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, in 1998 or something, he remade Psycho?

606
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:54,343
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things he did is he, like, in the death scenes, he added these random-ass clips that had nothing to do with it.

607
00:43:54,623 --> 00:44:02,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, when one person's getting stabbed, like, you see a train going through a tunnel, and, like, the clouds moving by in the sky, and it's, like, all this random shit.

608
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,947
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that reminded me of.

609
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:05,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

610
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:09,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that was Brooktown.

611
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Is chatroom giving you a hard time for being stuck on a Castlevania, DarkSakura?

612
00:44:17,466 --> 00:44:17,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

613
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:21,568
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

614
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:26,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to mention, though, Korinpa and Wing Island are both going to retail for $40 instead of $50.

615
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

616
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:29,751
[SPEAKER_03]: You picked that up through your distribution thing?

617
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:30,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they didn't say that at the show.

618
00:44:31,152 --> 00:44:32,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I picked it up.

619
00:44:32,693 --> 00:44:34,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I mentioned it maybe last week.

620
00:44:34,734 --> 00:44:35,114
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have.

621
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:35,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, but...

622
00:44:38,817 --> 00:44:42,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Other games at the show that they had, Death Junior Science Fair of Doom on the DS.

623
00:44:42,942 --> 00:44:43,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see it there.

624
00:44:44,163 --> 00:44:46,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It was playable, it's just not a lot of people were playing it.

625
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:47,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Death Junior fans.

626
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Go Pets on the Nintendo DS, which just interfaces with the PC.

627
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:53,913
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a DS and PC game, which I thought was interesting.

628
00:44:54,554 --> 00:44:57,017
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked to me like a cross between Animal Crossing and Nintendogs.

629
00:44:57,477 --> 00:44:58,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you'd probably love this game.

630
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:00,400
Maybe.

631
00:45:00,821 --> 00:45:01,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

632
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:02,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I might love this game.

633
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:03,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked interesting.

634
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,967
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphics looked a little rough, but it might have just been early stages.

635
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:08,829
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have it playable, just the preview.

636
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:10,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

637
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:11,872
[SPEAKER_03]: You talked about Hellboy already, right?

638
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:12,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

639
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:14,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Lost in Blue 2?

640
00:45:14,614 --> 00:45:15,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like the first one.

641
00:45:15,515 --> 00:45:16,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't care about the second one.

642
00:45:16,676 --> 00:45:17,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

643
00:45:17,237 --> 00:45:21,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some of the minigames, like the goat milking and the... No.

644
00:45:21,981 --> 00:45:25,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks literally exactly like the first one.

645
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:30,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Lunar Nights, which we told you about at F1 with Konami BBQ.

646
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:31,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty cool still.

647
00:45:31,825 --> 00:45:37,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And Winning 11 Pro Evo Soccer 2007 looked awesome on the 360.

648
00:45:39,371 --> 00:45:40,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Even on the PS2 it looks good.

649
00:45:41,093 --> 00:45:45,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks awesome, but to be honest, I couldn't get too excited about it because it's coming out next week.

650
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:50,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, why even waste the space with this game?

651
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's coming out

652
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:53,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, I mean, who cares?

653
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Make more console games!

654
00:46:39,946 --> 00:46:41,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop with all the portable games!

655
00:47:01,772 --> 00:47:03,273
[SPEAKER_02]: They had two last year.

656
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:11,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they had, you know, Rumble Roses, XX, Woo Goody, and then the follow-up smash hit, Bomberman.

657
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:14,937
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, two really awesome games for the 360.

658
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:20,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, well, this year they've got Hellboy, which Hellboy looks good.

659
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:21,739
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'll give them that.

660
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And DDR Universe.

661
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But put some more games on the 360.

662
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:28,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I guess, you know, winning 11 soccer, you know.

663
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:31,034
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

664
00:47:48,152 --> 00:47:54,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, oh goody, so we're going to see Karaoke Revolution, whatever the next one is, on 360 come fall.

665
00:47:55,455 --> 00:48:00,417
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, Kojima probably wants to take his time with Metal Gear Solid 4 since it's his last one.

666
00:48:00,717 --> 00:48:02,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he says that every time, dude.

667
00:48:02,377 --> 00:48:03,538
[SPEAKER_03]: He says that every time.

668
00:48:04,238 --> 00:48:05,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullshiz is his last one.

669
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:07,699
[SPEAKER_03]: There's money to be made.

670
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:08,320
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll come back.

671
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:14,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, I know unfortunately you didn't get to go because of school, but what do you think from the perspective of getting to read all about this?

672
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:17,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited about all this, or

673
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:19,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond just Castlevania?

674
00:48:19,518 --> 00:48:25,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Dracula X. I really don't care about anything but Dracula X. Really.

675
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing in the world.

676
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:33,182
[SPEAKER_03]: No Super Bowl, no Kororimpa.

677
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:43,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that one sounds interesting, but I really, my excitement over Dracula X is like phenomenal, monumental, bigger than a mole.

678
00:48:43,824 --> 00:48:44,505
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the creator.

679
00:48:44,545 --> 00:48:46,205
[SPEAKER_07]: In the terms of, you know.

680
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:49,933
[SPEAKER_03]: The creator of Castlevania was there.

681
00:48:50,956 --> 00:48:53,102
[SPEAKER_03]: He is still a fucking rock star.

682
00:48:53,303 --> 00:48:54,687
[SPEAKER_03]: He came out and said, I got a new hat.

683
00:48:55,852 --> 00:48:58,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a picture of him, remember?

684
00:48:58,513 --> 00:48:58,753
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cool.

685
00:48:58,773 --> 00:48:59,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

686
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:00,413
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran into him at E3, I remember that.

687
00:49:00,673 --> 00:49:02,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I have all the celebrity run-ins.

688
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:06,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to mention some things that kind of slipped under that most people didn't talk about.

689
00:49:07,415 --> 00:49:11,676
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some of the new lineups that they said for their plug-and-play stuff.

690
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:20,518
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them, which was really big and I'm surprised I didn't pick, Music Mania, which I don't know if it's like Beat Mania or Poppin' Music or something, but they have a 3 and 5 key mode.

691
00:49:21,818 --> 00:49:22,979
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

692
00:49:44,768 --> 00:49:46,629
[SPEAKER_07]: and also, you know, DDR.

693
00:49:46,689 --> 00:50:02,613
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a study going on by the, uh, West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency where they had, um, it was a 24 week at home clinical study where they had, um, people play, uh, DDR five days a week for at least 30 minutes and, uh, record their activity.

694
00:50:02,953 --> 00:50:03,873
[SPEAKER_07]: They had to help monitors.

695
00:50:03,893 --> 00:50:13,196
[SPEAKER_07]: They were tracking weight, blood pressure, arterial function, fitness level, uh, BMI, um, and general, uh, attitude toward exercise and, um,

696
00:50:14,036 --> 00:50:20,759
[SPEAKER_07]: These studies came by, and see, all their subjects, by the way, were above the 85th percentile for body mass index.

697
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:30,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Not all of them lost weight, but almost all of them were showing improved arterial function.

698
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:34,104
[SPEAKER_07]: They were showing general levels of well-being improved.

699
00:50:35,164 --> 00:50:36,605
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest thing on here, I thought, was...

700
00:50:37,546 --> 00:50:41,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Confidence and self-esteem improved.

701
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:48,793
[SPEAKER_07]: They were more willing to participate in activity because they were so active and had more faith in their bodies and their capabilities.

702
00:51:00,854 --> 00:51:04,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think that it's... I mean, we know exercise is healthy.

703
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:08,192
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that taking something that makes it really...

704
00:51:09,136 --> 00:51:16,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun, because in the average person's mind, I think, they're not going to see, oh, I'm exercising.

705
00:51:16,419 --> 00:51:22,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you don't have that whole, like, I can tell you from personal experience, I get weirded out with the idea of going to the gym.

706
00:51:22,301 --> 00:51:29,965
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something about that whole public sweating thing and the whole, you know, just like, and the whole, like, your bodybuilders, there's all those muscular people and everything.

707
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:34,126
[SPEAKER_03]: There's kind of that big fear that kind of goes with the gym and intimidation that comes with that.

708
00:51:34,627 --> 00:51:38,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have that when you're playing DDR, because it's like, I'm just playing a video game.

709
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:39,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't kicked out.

710
00:51:39,207 --> 00:51:39,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just Parapara.

711
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:03,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that was a good one too.

712
00:52:03,492 --> 00:52:12,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think the par par was more of a good aerobic workout than just DDRs because moving your arms with it, it's a lot more... Well, maybe that's what they hope to accomplish with this week.

713
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,582
[SPEAKER_07]: At any rate, there's a little bit more to this that I think is cool.

714
00:52:17,363 --> 00:52:19,845
[SPEAKER_07]: The office of a West Virginia governor...

715
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:40,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it looks like there's an association with the Department of Education and a few other facilities, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield, are giving financial support to eventually lead this into DDR games, training PE teachers, and promoting DDR clubs in West Virginia public schools.

716
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:44,070
[SPEAKER_03]: and Konami gets all the profits.

717
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:49,071
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay because it keeps new DDR games coming out at home and as long as they stay innovative, hey, they're fine by me.

718
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:52,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I just laugh for all those people who say, oh, DDR won't work in America.

719
00:52:54,313 --> 00:52:57,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you feel so stupid now.

720
00:52:58,515 --> 00:52:59,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

721
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:02,336
[SPEAKER_03]: This news is so huge that they even covered it on the national news.

722
00:53:02,376 --> 00:53:02,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear that?

723
00:53:03,936 --> 00:53:04,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

724
00:53:04,437 --> 00:53:05,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have a clip.

725
00:53:05,237 --> 00:53:05,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

726
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:17,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers in West Virginia announced Friday the results of a study that suggests playing the video game Dance Dance Revolution improves the health of overweight kids.

727
00:53:18,483 --> 00:53:21,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Though not as much as its rival game, Hamburger on a String.

728
00:53:25,388 --> 00:53:27,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, obviously that was from Saturday Night Live.

729
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:32,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still kind of funny nonetheless to see a little DDR joke make its way into Weekend Update there.

730
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:33,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Hamburger on a String.

731
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:34,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And who doesn't love...

732
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss Kevin Nealon doing the weekend update.

733
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I love that Amy Pollard.

734
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:39,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her.

735
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:39,937
[SPEAKER_03]: She's fine.

736
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:42,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as good as Tina Fey, but I love... She was with Upright Citizens Brigade.

737
00:53:43,198 --> 00:53:43,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

738
00:53:43,939 --> 00:53:44,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Hamburger on a string.

739
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And Miss Chevy Chase, too.

740
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:53,763
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we all know that the PlayStation 3 resembles a George Foreman grill or a grill of some sort.

741
00:53:54,103 --> 00:53:57,264
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, people have gone as far as making it into an actual grill.

742
00:53:57,744 --> 00:54:03,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now there's this one retailer in Akihabara that's...

743
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:09,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Selling some unofficial 6-axis soy sauce to go with the PlayStation 3 grill.

744
00:54:10,189 --> 00:54:11,030
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of a joke.

745
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:15,992
[SPEAKER_02]: They've basically rebranded some of the Bulldog brand soy sauce.

746
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:20,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's actually quite funny.

747
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,021
[SPEAKER_02]: They feature it in the smaller 20GB size or the larger 60GB size.

748
00:54:26,301 --> 00:54:28,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it 599 US dollars?

749
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:29,822
[SPEAKER_03]: 599 US dollars?

750
00:54:30,082 --> 00:54:31,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it made from giant enemy crabs?

751
00:54:31,882 --> 00:54:33,843
[SPEAKER_03]: No, in fact... Oh, these jokes will never get old!

752
00:54:34,223 --> 00:54:44,265
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually, it says, it's being sold at Segatsu Isagi, and it's being retailed for 399 yen, marked down from 499 yen, and 599 yen for the larger one.

753
00:54:48,662 --> 00:55:00,327
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's kind of funny though because it has a picture of Ken Kutaragi on the front there and it also has a picture of PlayStation 3 with the top lifted up with a grill on it.

754
00:55:00,587 --> 00:55:08,150
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I think that would be pretty cool if there was a grill on it because then you could eat and watch a Blu-ray movie at the same time.

755
00:55:10,111 --> 00:55:15,693
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone doesn't know, Akihabara is the technical district, I guess.

756
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:20,752
[SPEAKER_07]: You can buy all of your techie goods and now barbecue sauce.

757
00:55:22,093 --> 00:55:25,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to buy barbecue sauce when I go buy a stereo.

758
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:30,516
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Janai says, Six Axis equals most innovative controller ever.

759
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,157
[SPEAKER_03]: PS3 is the best.

760
00:55:33,078 --> 00:55:33,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to know.

761
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:39,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to know we have some Sony fans in chat because, you know, sometimes it feels like there are no Sony fans left in the world.

762
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,621
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad to see somebody is still standing behind him.

763
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:43,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

764
00:55:43,795 --> 00:55:46,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, certainly these guys are fans of Sony.

765
00:55:46,498 --> 00:55:48,801
[SPEAKER_03]: They just express their fanboyism in a different way.

766
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:51,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's, let's see, who did this?

767
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:57,892
[SPEAKER_03]: On the first day that firmware 3.10 came out, it got cracked.

768
00:56:00,435 --> 00:56:01,075
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of funny.

769
00:56:01,415 --> 00:56:12,899
[SPEAKER_03]: This was cracked by Team C plus D. And basically what happened is that, of course, they released the new firmware just a few days ago, and it got cracked right in the same day by this team who works hard to crack the games.

770
00:56:13,179 --> 00:56:18,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, to crack the firmware so that you can still continue to play your old school Nintendo games on your PSP.

771
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:21,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've already come out with a custom firmware for 3.1.

772
00:56:21,622 --> 00:56:22,763
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

773
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

774
00:56:23,223 --> 00:56:23,503
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

775
00:56:27,624 --> 00:56:35,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, now you can actually install the custom firmware, play all your updated games, and still be able to play your wonderful NES ROMs.

776
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:42,029
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Janai says, continuous Sony fanboyism saying, come on, Sony does what Nintendo don't.

777
00:56:42,749 --> 00:56:47,190
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD counters with, everyone stands behind Sony to laugh at them behind their back.

778
00:56:48,891 --> 00:56:52,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says, I'll wait for the PS3 to be redesigned and retailed for $149.

779
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:53,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it six more months.

780
00:56:53,992 --> 00:56:54,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.

781
00:56:56,153 --> 00:56:56,433
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

782
00:56:58,106 --> 00:56:59,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more PlayStation stories?

783
00:57:01,608 --> 00:57:04,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I suppose I have some information.

784
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:04,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

785
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:05,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Some.

786
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:13,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a little game that spawned a very interesting little music video called Saints Row.

787
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,377
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been confirmed that it will be going on to PS3.

788
00:57:21,098 --> 00:57:25,240
[SPEAKER_07]: It's staying sometime this spring and it will have a PlayStation Network support.

789
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that means multiplayer online.

790
00:57:30,162 --> 00:57:34,683
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no mention, however, if they're going to have any additional content.

791
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:41,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Saints Row and that game had some CD parts in it.

792
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:47,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you happen to be in some of the CD parts of Japan, you too can play the PlayStation 3.

793
00:57:48,075 --> 00:57:50,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of Japan's love hotels.

794
00:57:51,376 --> 00:57:54,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, that is one of those brothel hotels.

795
00:57:54,917 --> 00:58:01,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Casa de Dew in Shibuya, Tokyo.

796
00:58:02,118 --> 00:58:09,000
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, with, I guess, your stay at these love hotels, you can be able to play PlayStation 3 for free.

797
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:11,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that's great.

798
00:58:11,606 --> 00:58:19,809
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you know, I would be thinking, if you're staying at a love hotel, wouldn't you be going there for sex and not to play the PlayStation 3?

799
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:24,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is Sony trying to tell me the PlayStation 3 is better than sex?

800
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:33,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it one of those things where it's like, okay, I'm going here and not only will I get a hot chick to sleep with me, or borderline hot chick to sleep with me, but she'll play games with me.

801
00:58:33,993 --> 00:58:36,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, love hotels aren't really just that.

802
00:58:36,114 --> 00:58:39,155
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also where people meet for rendezvous with their

803
00:58:40,427 --> 00:58:41,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Significant other.

804
00:58:41,828 --> 00:58:49,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all she would have to do is bake me a pie, and it's like the full thing.

805
00:58:49,913 --> 00:58:51,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to get the death glare from Jamie.

806
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:53,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was interesting, though.

807
00:58:53,935 --> 00:59:00,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess that's pretty cool, because after you've done it, then you can play video games.

808
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like you never left home.

809
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to a previous story in chat, reading some comments here.

810
00:59:07,022 --> 00:59:10,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike W says, it was decrypted day one, talking about the firmware.

811
00:59:11,284 --> 00:59:12,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was cracked.

812
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:13,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Fault story, whatever.

813
00:59:13,485 --> 00:59:14,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if OLR gets it wrong.

814
00:59:14,805 --> 00:59:15,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know.

815
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:27,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Regardless, having the firmware get fucked with on day one, having some form of success with it, whether it be decryption or whatever it is, has got to say something.

816
00:59:28,572 --> 00:59:29,992
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't take them long to make a custom.

817
00:59:30,012 --> 00:59:31,533
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't take much longer after that anyway.

818
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:32,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

819
00:59:33,126 --> 00:59:36,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma is bold and says, PlayStation 3 equals Sony's final console.

820
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:41,608
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD says, What would you listen to in a love hotel while playing video games?

821
00:59:41,668 --> 00:59:44,808
[SPEAKER_03]: The I Want You to Watch Me Play Madden skit from MadTV.

822
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:47,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've ever seen that, but it's kind of funny.

823
00:59:50,209 --> 00:59:53,530
[SPEAKER_03]: RavensDolphin says, Loki is going there with Nelly to a love hotel.

824
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,090
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wouldn't be going there.

825
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:00,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I travel all the way to Japan to go to a love hotel?

826
01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:01,271
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ridiculous.

827
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:03,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom of Speech

828
01:00:27,785 --> 01:00:34,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, what they were trying to do is, you know, try to change it to say that Utah was going to be basically had to be sold just like pornography does.

829
01:00:35,971 --> 01:00:36,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

830
01:00:36,752 --> 01:00:38,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Republican Kay McCliff had this to say.

831
01:00:39,013 --> 01:00:47,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I am concerned when all the legal experts, including our own attorney general, as well as the sponsor, tell us that the bill is likely to fail in a constitutional challenge.

832
01:00:47,779 --> 01:00:53,844
[SPEAKER_03]: One where we cannot control the amount we spend because we spend our side and then we are potentially obliged to spend the legal costs of the other side.

833
01:00:54,704 --> 01:00:58,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Kay is trying to draft a substitute bill to replace the original.

834
01:00:59,266 --> 01:01:00,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave it to a Republican.

835
01:01:00,867 --> 01:01:07,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I don't want to turn this into a political war, but it's just general ignorance, I think, about the gaming community from everyone.

836
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:11,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of folks could stand to be educated, no matter who you are or how you vote.

837
01:01:12,212 --> 01:01:13,333
[SPEAKER_03]: But mostly Republicans.

838
01:01:13,893 --> 01:01:15,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people just don't get it.

839
01:01:15,874 --> 01:01:17,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just giving y'all a hard time.

840
01:01:18,215 --> 01:01:18,595
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

841
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:20,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but there is... I have some...

842
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:25,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have some news about someone who has his head up his ass that makes me happy.

843
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:28,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of, you know, Republicans.

844
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I won't go off on Republicans anymore.

845
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:39,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, sorry, there was some debate going on.

846
01:01:40,122 --> 01:01:40,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we start over, please?

847
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:41,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

848
01:01:42,423 --> 01:01:44,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

849
01:01:45,963 --> 01:01:48,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of someone who has his head up his ass...

850
01:01:50,108 --> 01:02:11,236
[SPEAKER_07]: he who shall not be named except right now Jack Thompson has been called on yet another complaint with the Florida Bar it's oh my god anyway there's a pending judicial review for five counts of professional misconduct against dumbass

851
01:02:12,594 --> 01:02:15,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be impersonal, right?

852
01:02:15,457 --> 01:02:23,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Against who shall not be named to be... Actually, he's supposed to be going to the State Supreme Court for action.

853
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:24,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's pretty cool.

854
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:26,350
[SPEAKER_07]: But the quote on here...

855
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:37,855
[SPEAKER_07]: In the suit, he who shall not be named represented the families of two Fayette, Alabama police officers and a police dispatcher murdered by an 18-year-old grand theft auto player in 2003.

856
01:02:38,176 --> 01:02:44,079
[SPEAKER_07]: At the time of his arrest for the killings, Devin Moore reportedly said, life is like a video game, you have to die sometime.

857
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Moore subsequently convicted of the murders now sits on Alabama's death row.

858
01:02:48,161 --> 01:02:51,923
[SPEAKER_07]: He who shall not be named was not involved in the criminal case against Moore.

859
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:52,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

860
01:02:56,337 --> 01:03:04,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, the other two complaints actually have to do with the attacks he made on Shock Radio in South Florida.

861
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:09,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I'm just so disgusted.

862
01:03:09,964 --> 01:03:13,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, I hope that he is disbarred.

863
01:03:13,866 --> 01:03:14,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope this is the end of it.

864
01:03:16,707 --> 01:03:19,909
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome if we never had to report on him again.

865
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:21,129
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the best thing ever.

866
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:22,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd hold a party.

867
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:25,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Ranma and Sha- I think- I think we would- You know what?

868
01:03:25,988 --> 01:03:27,970
[SPEAKER_03]: If this happens, we should throw a party.

869
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,531
[SPEAKER_03]: We absolutely should throw a party.

870
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:37,417
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a special party edition of Orange Lounge Radio, um, celebrating the vanquishment of he who shall not be named.

871
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:38,518
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get guests and everything.

872
01:03:38,558 --> 01:03:42,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you anything, cause you know Gamer Andy was a big part of that flower, and he doesn't live that far away.

873
01:03:42,461 --> 01:03:44,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you we could get him here to join our party.

874
01:03:44,143 --> 01:03:44,323
[SPEAKER_02]: We should

875
01:03:45,063 --> 01:03:48,904
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll hold a big, massive freaking party.

876
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:51,825
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll play Mortal Kombat Armageddon with custom characters.

877
01:03:52,765 --> 01:03:56,246
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll play nothing but video games where we put Jack Thompson in them.

878
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:58,546
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the Combine game?

879
01:03:59,026 --> 01:04:00,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, we'll play that too.

880
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:00,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

881
01:04:00,707 --> 01:04:01,807
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll play that too.

882
01:04:02,647 --> 01:04:03,587
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll piss them off.

883
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:06,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And our Music of Choice is 2 Live Crew and Ice-T.

884
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:08,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it on!

885
01:04:08,058 --> 01:04:08,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this idea!

886
01:04:08,899 --> 01:04:09,359
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

887
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:11,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should have this party anyway.

888
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:16,123
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but we're, okay, the party only happens if he gets disbarred.

889
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, is that the criteria?

890
01:04:18,244 --> 01:04:23,527
[SPEAKER_03]: If he gets disbarred in the state of Florida, OLR, he lost his license party.

891
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:26,489
[SPEAKER_07]: He who shall not be named is vanquished.

892
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:32,252
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if he is not disbarred, we send him a bag of poo in the mail.

893
01:04:33,175 --> 01:04:33,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Voldemort

894
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:57,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that idea.

895
01:04:58,068 --> 01:04:59,589
[SPEAKER_07]: He is just he who shall not be named.

896
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:02,131
[SPEAKER_03]: From here on out, we are calling him Jack Voldemort.

897
01:05:02,372 --> 01:05:03,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that idea.

898
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:16,323
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, the reason why I brought up Two Life Crew and Ice-T is that he was also instrumental in the whole cop killer scandal for Ice-T and for Two Life Crew's as nasty as they want to be.

899
01:05:16,623 --> 01:05:18,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll also listen to Howard Stern.

900
01:05:18,845 --> 01:05:19,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

901
01:05:20,186 --> 01:05:22,227
[SPEAKER_07]: We should copy it and send it to Howard Stern.

902
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:23,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe not.

903
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,942
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

904
01:05:56,004 --> 01:05:58,706
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's our chance to rant about whatever we want.

905
01:05:58,726 --> 01:06:00,007
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the FUs of the week.

906
01:06:00,147 --> 01:06:01,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it out of your system, DarkSakura.

907
01:06:01,848 --> 01:06:02,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two.

908
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:05,351
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one, FU to my uterus.

909
01:06:06,772 --> 01:06:13,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Next one is an FU to Roseville, Mitsubishi, you bastards!

910
01:06:14,597 --> 01:06:16,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this is what happens.

911
01:06:17,499 --> 01:06:19,080
[SPEAKER_07]: My husband has a 2006...

912
01:06:24,767 --> 01:06:29,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Lancer, um, Ralliard, sorry.

913
01:06:29,508 --> 01:06:31,869
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like a model under the evolution.

914
01:06:31,929 --> 01:06:33,789
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a nice, nice car.

915
01:06:34,809 --> 01:06:40,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And he uses it to go to work, and he uses it, you know, sometimes for a couple of Bay Area trips.

916
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:43,051
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't drive it really crazily.

917
01:06:43,371 --> 01:06:47,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I drive more violently than he does, and my car's still in good shape.

918
01:06:48,692 --> 01:06:51,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, um, the transmission balloons.

919
01:06:52,422 --> 01:07:00,745
[SPEAKER_07]: and he hadn't been, you know, in a car with only 15,000 miles on it that he's only had for a year, there's no reason for a transmission to go out that quickly.

920
01:07:01,165 --> 01:07:04,486
[SPEAKER_07]: So he took it to Roosevelt Mitsubishi.

921
01:07:05,126 --> 01:07:10,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And Bob Coffey, what I was saying is that it's the step under the Evo.

922
01:07:10,268 --> 01:07:11,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to what I said.

923
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:11,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

924
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:15,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And the FU to my uterus is for PMS.

925
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,130
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, back to the car.

926
01:07:20,558 --> 01:07:32,971
[SPEAKER_07]: When he took it in, this was... The car, first of all, has the 10-year warranty on it, bumper-to-bumper warranty.

927
01:07:33,932 --> 01:07:42,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So he took the car in and they said, well, you know, we have to strip it down to look at the transmission and if it's your fault, you pay $1,100 to fix it.

928
01:07:44,378 --> 01:07:51,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first of all, if you don't drive your car like shit, then there's no reason for the transmission to go out.

929
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:59,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, he said, the hell with that, um, and said, you're not gonna, you know, you're not gonna charge me for taking it apart, you're gonna do the diagnostic on it.

930
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:01,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, fine, then warranty won't cover it.

931
01:08:02,163 --> 01:08:10,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So he gets on the line with the, um, uh, with the, I guess, the Mitsubishi corporate, they have a big stink over it.

932
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:12,986
[SPEAKER_07]: He said the customer service girl was friendly, but...

933
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:40,958
[SPEAKER_07]: said that um the uh the caseworker was all like okay look we're gonna have them break down the uh the car for free it's our dime which they should have done in the first place hi and then they said if the um if they determine uh the transmission thing is his fault then they'll put it back together for free and let him take it wherever he feels that he needs to to pay less for it but um

934
01:08:42,228 --> 01:08:51,354
[SPEAKER_07]: If I start talking about how much I love my new WRX STI, you'll find out what happened.

935
01:08:51,834 --> 01:08:52,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading comments from chat.

936
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:54,936
[SPEAKER_03]: We had someone named TheUterus join chat.

937
01:08:55,236 --> 01:08:57,257
[SPEAKER_03]: That says, don't let your uterus drive your car.

938
01:08:57,998 --> 01:08:59,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ranma says, fucking cunt.

939
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:01,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to say, don't talk to Jamie like that.

940
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:01,960
[SPEAKER_03]: That's rude.

941
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, he was saying someone else.

942
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:10,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, and then also, but Ranma did say this, which I thought was really funny.

943
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:17,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So if Jack equals Voldemort, that means that Jamie equals Hermione, Skye equals Harry, and Loki equals Ron.

944
01:09:18,005 --> 01:09:21,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that means that I get Victor Crumb, and then the movie is kind of hot.

945
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:25,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do I get, Cho Chang?

946
01:09:27,169 --> 01:09:28,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Hippity-doo-dah.

947
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:28,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway.

948
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:29,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that it?

949
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:29,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

950
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you and your uterus done?

951
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:35,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Except she was really cool with this being, having that thick Scottish accent.

952
01:09:35,873 --> 01:09:36,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally didn't expect it.

953
01:09:36,893 --> 01:09:38,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you and your uterus finished?

954
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:41,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that men had cramps.

955
01:09:44,259 --> 01:09:46,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We do get cramps of a different sort.

956
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:49,746
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wish that men had hormone-related cramps.

957
01:09:51,989 --> 01:09:53,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love it.

958
01:09:55,073 --> 01:09:57,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe someday you can have balls.

959
01:09:57,896 --> 01:09:59,118
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I can kick you in them.

960
01:09:59,594 --> 01:10:01,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, uh, Loki.

961
01:10:01,895 --> 01:10:05,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wish women could drive better, but we don't always get what we want, do we now?

962
01:10:05,276 --> 01:10:05,896
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

963
01:10:06,116 --> 01:10:06,677
[SPEAKER_08]: That's you.

964
01:10:07,297 --> 01:10:10,938
[SPEAKER_02]: We did figure out why, we did figure out though why women drive bad.

965
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:18,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because estrogen causes you to have, you know, I don't know, some sort of balance problems or like, you know, the world spins or something.

966
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:19,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

967
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,203
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to use that as an excuse for now.

968
01:10:22,443 --> 01:10:23,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I drive really well.

969
01:10:23,163 --> 01:10:25,144
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a fight in the parking lot after the show.

970
01:10:25,164 --> 01:10:26,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I drive, Rob.

971
01:10:26,444 --> 01:10:26,764
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

972
01:10:27,124 --> 01:10:28,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I drive really well.

973
01:10:29,335 --> 01:10:30,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You drive like a bat out of hell.

974
01:10:31,016 --> 01:10:35,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you do get us from point A to point B the quickest way possible.

975
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that.

976
01:10:37,662 --> 01:10:39,083
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't cut people off.

977
01:10:39,643 --> 01:10:41,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't talk on my phone while I drive.

978
01:10:41,205 --> 01:10:42,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like somebody in this room.

979
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:45,708
[SPEAKER_04]: You cast hexes on people when you drive.

980
01:10:45,748 --> 01:10:47,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And they get out of my way.

981
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:49,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, finish.

982
01:10:50,492 --> 01:10:52,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember what my FU of the week was, too.

983
01:10:56,022 --> 01:11:06,210
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm just going to say bad to women drivers because there's been a lot of them, especially driving slow or they can't seem to navigate that minivan.

984
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:09,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if you can't fucking drive a car, just stay at home.

985
01:11:09,272 --> 01:11:11,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Just fuck everybody who drives a minivan.

986
01:11:12,975 --> 01:11:13,956
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't need one of those.

987
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:18,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And I swear to God I fucking hate people that drive, you know, SUVs.

988
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:26,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Off-road vehicles, mind you, that have to go over the fucking speed bumps like it's, like their car's made of glass.

989
01:11:26,701 --> 01:11:28,141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking off-road car.

990
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:30,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be able to handle a damn little speed bump.

991
01:11:30,362 --> 01:11:32,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my car could go over that super fast.

992
01:11:32,842 --> 01:11:33,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't yours?

993
01:11:34,102 --> 01:11:35,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, I'm having to loop the music.

994
01:11:35,662 --> 01:11:37,103
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to six minutes here.

995
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:39,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I have one, I have one more thing.

996
01:11:39,023 --> 01:11:39,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, goody.

997
01:11:39,683 --> 01:11:40,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one more.

998
01:11:40,423 --> 01:11:40,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

999
01:11:41,243 --> 01:11:44,464
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to people who think that just because you're married you need to start breeding.

1000
01:11:46,641 --> 01:11:47,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Moo!

1001
01:11:47,802 --> 01:11:48,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Moo!

1002
01:11:49,983 --> 01:11:53,365
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, children do not save a marriage.

1003
01:11:53,785 --> 01:11:54,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it worse.

1004
01:11:56,447 --> 01:12:01,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, if you can't afford... This is episode part FU, because that's all this segment's going to be.

1005
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:04,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Secondly, if you cannot afford the child, don't have one!

1006
01:12:05,752 --> 01:12:11,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Thirdly, if I say I don't want children, fucking respect what I have to say.

1007
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:17,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't keep pushing it until I go puke in the bathroom at Cattleman's.

1008
01:12:18,598 --> 01:12:19,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1009
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I do my FUs now?

1010
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:22,101
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1011
01:12:22,962 --> 01:12:24,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, fine.

1012
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,486
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week also goes to Jamie's uterus.

1013
01:12:28,286 --> 01:12:30,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would like to say an FU... Just kidding, heart.

1014
01:12:30,868 --> 01:12:31,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think she heard me.

1015
01:12:31,789 --> 01:12:33,010
[SPEAKER_07]: My uterus, my choice.

1016
01:12:33,691 --> 01:12:36,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also like to give an F and it's my choice to say FU.

1017
01:12:36,693 --> 01:12:37,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

1018
01:12:37,414 --> 01:12:39,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart, love you.

1019
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:41,177
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, I want to say FU to dentistry.

1020
01:12:42,165 --> 01:12:43,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1021
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:06,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like going to the dentist is like going to used car salesman sometimes.

1022
01:13:06,968 --> 01:13:07,729
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much pressure.

1023
01:13:08,029 --> 01:13:09,511
[SPEAKER_03]: No wonder people are afraid of the dentist.

1024
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:10,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not afraid of the dentist.

1025
01:13:10,592 --> 01:13:12,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I just fall asleep.

1026
01:13:12,634 --> 01:13:14,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the drill work I'm afraid of.

1027
01:13:14,095 --> 01:13:15,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid of the way they treat people.

1028
01:13:15,797 --> 01:13:16,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1029
01:13:16,157 --> 01:13:17,098
[SPEAKER_07]: You should go to my dentist.

1030
01:13:17,118 --> 01:13:17,719
[SPEAKER_07]: He's really cool.

1031
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:20,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think my insurance will let me, but that's a whole other F you.

1032
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:22,703
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to your testicles, by the way.

1033
01:13:22,723 --> 01:13:23,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1034
01:13:23,124 --> 01:13:24,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure, sure.

1035
01:13:24,245 --> 01:13:24,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

1036
01:13:26,767 --> 01:13:27,468
[SPEAKER_03]: F you, Jamie.

1037
01:13:29,136 --> 01:13:30,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God this is radio.

1038
01:13:30,537 --> 01:13:32,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Your tattoos sound like Grover.

1039
01:13:36,759 --> 01:13:37,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're blue.

1040
01:13:42,221 --> 01:13:45,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Octaves of Jamie that you normally don't listen.

1041
01:13:46,142 --> 01:13:51,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's picking up because she doesn't have the mic near her, but she's going about three octaves higher than we usually hear.

1042
01:13:51,424 --> 01:13:53,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1043
01:13:57,981 --> 01:13:58,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Far!

1044
01:13:58,121 --> 01:13:58,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Far!

1045
01:13:58,241 --> 01:13:58,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Far!

1046
01:13:58,342 --> 01:13:58,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Far!

1047
01:14:12,372 --> 01:14:13,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God this was a radio.

1048
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:29,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of near and far, one game that's near dear to my heart, Grand Theft Auto, is doing really well far away in Japan, where Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has taken number one in their sales charts.

1049
01:14:30,603 --> 01:14:59,610
[SPEAKER_02]: that is right beating out such DS titles as those brain training things fuck brain training it's all about killing hookers that's really what Japan needs and god damn it they just got their dose of killing hookers so way to go Japan you just need to get on the bandwagon now with Grand Theft Auto 4 then I could be killing I don't know more hookers from Japan Kevin DDR says what GTA can't do well in Japan it's doing well now it's number one

1050
01:15:00,273 --> 01:15:00,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob...

1051
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:26,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Winners don't use drugs.

1052
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:28,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the FBI warning.

1053
01:15:28,964 --> 01:15:29,624
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1054
01:15:29,704 --> 01:15:31,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, never do that again.

1055
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:35,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny and you know it.

1056
01:15:35,608 --> 01:15:36,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Never do that.

1057
01:15:36,889 --> 01:15:39,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of blue things, Sonic the Hedgehog is...

1058
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:44,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirt Devil, Upright Vacuum

1059
01:16:05,868 --> 01:16:09,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when they were selling the Wii for like, what was it, $1,119?

1060
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:11,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever was the release date.

1061
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:12,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody screwed up the database.

1062
01:16:12,831 --> 01:16:13,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Something similar happened here.

1063
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:16,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they just found out that Sonic the Hedgehog sucked.

1064
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:16,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha!

1065
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:17,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what you did there.

1066
01:16:18,313 --> 01:16:21,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I hadn't heard that joke a million times already on Kotaku.

1067
01:16:22,654 --> 01:16:23,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1068
01:16:24,315 --> 01:16:26,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of games that suck.

1069
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:28,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Unexpected.

1070
01:16:28,456 --> 01:16:29,517
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like totally rad.

1071
01:16:31,677 --> 01:16:32,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Burger King had...

1072
01:16:34,358 --> 01:16:41,682
[SPEAKER_07]: They reported higher than anticipated quarterly earnings because of the Xbox 360 promo games.

1073
01:16:41,963 --> 01:16:43,564
[SPEAKER_07]: At least that's what they figured.

1074
01:16:44,144 --> 01:16:49,607
[SPEAKER_07]: The games actually pulled sales up to $38 million in the U.S.

1075
01:16:49,767 --> 01:16:50,168
[SPEAKER_07]: alone.

1076
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:57,352
[SPEAKER_07]: How can these games have gone double-platinum?

1077
01:16:58,345 --> 01:17:00,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess with the fact that they were four bucks a piece.

1078
01:17:01,308 --> 01:17:07,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there are two million achievement point whores in the world who just needed the extra 600 points that these games would give.

1079
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:09,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Is actually what happened.

1080
01:17:09,295 --> 01:17:09,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

1081
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:12,719
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also now 99 cents each.

1082
01:17:13,299 --> 01:17:13,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about that.

1083
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,801
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.

1084
01:17:15,301 --> 01:17:18,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you haven't bought them yet... There are two that I still need.

1085
01:17:18,184 --> 01:17:19,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I only have Sneak King.

1086
01:17:19,945 --> 01:17:21,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you haven't bought it yet,

1087
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:22,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Might as well do it.

1088
01:17:22,797 --> 01:17:25,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because 99 cents, that's not bad for a game.

1089
01:17:25,758 --> 01:17:26,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it does suck.

1090
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,659
[SPEAKER_03]: These will be collector's things before too long.

1091
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,960
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be as rare as Rondo of Blood.

1092
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:32,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe not.

1093
01:17:33,521 --> 01:17:34,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's go.

1094
01:17:34,841 --> 01:17:36,222
[SPEAKER_07]: But Nowhere Near is awesome.

1095
01:17:36,822 --> 01:17:40,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear what games are coming out very soon that could soon become collector's items.

1096
01:17:40,984 --> 01:17:43,504
[SPEAKER_03]: You have any exclusives for us this week, Loki, on release dates?

1097
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:46,045
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I took time off work.

1098
01:17:46,085 --> 01:17:46,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

1099
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:48,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And there wasn't really, you know.

1100
01:17:48,812 --> 01:17:50,193
[SPEAKER_02]: much to mention anyway.

1101
01:17:50,313 --> 01:17:57,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we mentioned everything probably last week, and anything exclusive would have been at Konami's Gamer Day and all that fun stuff.

1102
01:17:58,476 --> 01:17:59,256
[SPEAKER_02]: What was I going to say, though?

1103
01:17:59,536 --> 01:18:01,677
[SPEAKER_02]: But this week, though, there's some good stuff coming out.

1104
01:18:02,217 --> 01:18:12,841
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a fan of Winning Eleven, you'll be happy to know that that is finally making its way out now on PlayStation 2, on the 360, DS, and PSP.

1105
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:14,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty awesome.

1106
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's going to be...

1107
01:18:19,231 --> 01:18:21,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there's not a lot of PlayStation 2 games coming out this week.

1108
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:22,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that for a fact.

1109
01:18:23,812 --> 01:18:30,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe the Final Fantasy 6 comes out on the Game Boy Advance this week, which is pretty awesome.

1110
01:18:32,015 --> 01:18:35,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely check that out, because I know... What was it?

1111
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:36,816
[SPEAKER_02]: 5 did really well.

1112
01:18:36,856 --> 01:18:37,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's picking up 5.

1113
01:18:38,597 --> 01:18:46,559
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be some more Wii's and DS lights coming to... I want to say to all the retailers this week as well, because I know...

1114
01:18:48,046 --> 01:18:49,527
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been out of stock for a long time.

1115
01:18:49,547 --> 01:18:51,968
[SPEAKER_02]: They were actually sold out at Nintendo for like the last two weeks.

1116
01:18:53,609 --> 01:19:00,972
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, let's see, other than that stuff, well, it was just a whole lot of crap coming out this week.

1117
01:19:02,393 --> 01:19:05,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to say that's probably, you know, what I'd really, oh, how could I forget this?

1118
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:08,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Diddy Kong Racing DS, that's coming out.

1119
01:19:08,256 --> 01:19:09,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been seeing commercials for that.

1120
01:19:09,897 --> 01:19:12,298
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to, you know, get your fix on like kind of, uh,

1121
01:19:13,044 --> 01:19:14,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart-type racing game.

1122
01:19:14,665 --> 01:19:15,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of cool.

1123
01:19:15,346 --> 01:19:17,668
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a create-your-own-track mode.

1124
01:19:17,688 --> 01:19:19,970
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically draw a track with the stylus, so that's kind of neat.

1125
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:25,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Artolico on PlayStation 2, another Atlus RPG, so definitely worth checking out.

1126
01:19:26,215 --> 01:19:33,561
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into puzzle games, Capcom Puzzle World on the PSP, so that was pretty fun because it has Puzzle Fighter on it.

1127
01:19:34,221 --> 01:19:38,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI on PlayStation 2, if you're a fan of that.

1128
01:19:39,707 --> 01:19:43,751
[SPEAKER_02]: and then MVP07 NCAA Baseball if you're into college baseball on PlayStation 2.

1129
01:19:44,612 --> 01:19:50,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say release date-wise, because I don't know if you explicitly stated this on an earlier show, but we did confirm that DDR Universe is February 27th.

1130
01:19:50,918 --> 01:19:51,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1131
01:19:51,939 --> 01:19:54,241
[SPEAKER_03]: So, almost March, but not quite.

1132
01:19:54,462 --> 01:19:57,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd also like to mention Lunar Nights on the DS is coming out this week.

1133
01:19:58,245 --> 01:19:58,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very cool.

1134
01:19:59,647 --> 01:20:01,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, that was a neat title, I might have to pick that up.

1135
01:20:02,645 --> 01:20:08,727
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, coming out in Japan, we like to cover Japanese release dates, too, because sometimes it's kind of interesting to see what they get a lot later.

1136
01:20:09,027 --> 01:20:12,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, what they get over there now, we may be getting over here pretty soon.

1137
01:20:12,868 --> 01:20:14,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if this might be one of them.

1138
01:20:14,348 --> 01:20:18,689
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Xbox 360, they're getting a badly needed role-playing game this week.

1139
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:22,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, Xbox kind of gets a lot of slack for not having a lot of choice when it comes to role-playing games.

1140
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:26,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sure, you have Phantasy Star, which is kind of borderline, and then you have Enchanted Arms.

1141
01:20:26,771 --> 01:20:29,092
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're getting a new game this week from Type.com.

1142
01:20:29,728 --> 01:20:30,889
[SPEAKER_03]: from Idea Factory.

1143
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:34,672
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Diario Rebirth Moon Legend.

1144
01:20:34,712 --> 01:20:39,436
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new RPG coming out on the Xbox 360 coming out in Japan on the 8th.

[SPEAKER_03]: It's also coming out with a little stick.

1149
01:20:53,047 --> 01:20:54,869

01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:59,352

1155
01:21:41,284 --> 01:21:47,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cover for Full House Kiss 2, it's four guys all surrounding a chick holding a bouquet.

1156
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:49,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what that means.

1157
01:21:50,135 --> 01:21:51,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, Dating Sim.

1158
01:21:51,256 --> 01:21:53,758
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all going to go banger.

[SPEAKER_03]: New Rainbow Island, Hurdy Gurdy Daibouken is coming out this week.

1163
01:22:11,914 --> 01:22:13,836
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be tons of fun, I'm sure.

1164
01:22:13,856 --> 01:22:14,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow Island!

1165
01:22:14,957 --> 01:22:15,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but it's kind of like...

1166
01:22:16,618 --> 01:22:17,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow Island!

1167
01:22:17,258 --> 01:22:17,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow Island!

1168
01:22:38,527 --> 01:22:43,328
[SPEAKER_07]: We have coming out February 6th, War Rock on PC.

1169
01:22:44,029 --> 01:22:48,830
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 8th, Sam & Max Episode 3, The Mole, The Mob, and The Meatball on PC.

[SPEAKER_03]: Cry Cry Cry Cry

1175
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:01,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Sob.

1176
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:05,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Weep.

1177
01:24:05,503 --> 01:24:05,763
[SPEAKER_02]: QQ.

1178
01:24:06,383 --> 01:24:13,805
[SPEAKER_02]: One movie that doesn't really need to be made is definitely spawned from a game with lots of sequels, DOA the movie.

1179
01:24:14,685 --> 01:24:18,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally it was going to be a theatrical movie, but then apparently they realized, hey, you know what?

1180
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:25,327
[SPEAKER_02]: This movie really sucks, so let's just release it straight to DVD, which means that someone dumped it to the internet.

1181
01:24:26,288 --> 01:24:27,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't the movie have Ali Larder in it?

1182
01:24:29,508 --> 01:24:35,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Allie Larder is the one chick on Heroes that nobody likes her storyline.

1183
01:24:35,873 --> 01:24:39,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Is she the one who plays the split personality?

1184
01:24:40,977 --> 01:24:42,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't even watched any and I know who that is.

1185
01:24:43,999 --> 01:24:45,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she's in the movie, right?

1186
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:48,543
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I saw was a scene of her in that place.

1187
01:24:50,704 --> 01:24:51,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Spoilers!

1188
01:24:51,765 --> 01:24:52,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I told Rob.

1189
01:24:53,226 --> 01:24:56,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It is available on Google Video and to be honest...

1190
01:24:57,208 --> 01:25:02,311
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to watch the whole thing, I guess it's better than spending the money to rent it or buy it.

1191
01:25:02,452 --> 01:25:08,776
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, I just hear it's just yet another really bad movie.

1192
01:25:09,556 --> 01:25:10,077
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't play.

1193
01:25:12,018 --> 01:25:16,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think they had originally it linked on... Don't they keep taking it down and stuff?

1194
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:18,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps getting taken down, but it is...

1195
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:27,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It does come back up, and if you read the Kotaku story, which links to the Destructoid story... It's like that Natalie Portman video when she rapped on SNL.

1196
01:25:27,339 --> 01:25:31,820
[SPEAKER_03]: They just kept taking it off of YouTube, and it kept coming right back.

1197
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's what you can do if you really want to watch it and keep it or whatever.

1198
01:25:35,841 --> 01:25:45,443
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always download the PSP or iPod versions, and you can download those straight to your PC, if you don't want to stream it later on.

1199
01:25:46,168 --> 01:25:53,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Brad from PodCulture, which is another indie podcast, is in our chat room right now and says, LOL, we just reviewed that on our latest episode.

1200
01:25:53,496 --> 01:25:56,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to hear Brad's review of Dead or Alive the movie.

1201
01:25:56,738 --> 01:26:07,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out podculture.blogspot.com This whole movie could have been made a lot better and worth watching if it were rated NC-17 and there was more nudity.

1202
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:10,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now, as it stands, there is no nudity in it.

1203
01:26:10,609 --> 01:26:15,553
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the main problem to why this... Because it doesn't matter if the movie sucked.

1204
01:26:15,774 --> 01:26:17,675
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it had nudity, it would have been great.

1205
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:23,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever's playing this Rondo of Blood is really bad.

1206
01:26:24,121 --> 01:26:24,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

1207
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:30,216
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the... You know, one of those sites taped me playing one of the game.

1208
01:26:30,236 --> 01:26:33,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who did it, but you know how like they do the... Did you keep getting picked up by the dragon?

1209
01:26:33,739 --> 01:26:33,979
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1210
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Then this isn't you.

1211
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:35,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

1212
01:26:37,042 --> 01:26:37,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1213
01:27:04,048 --> 01:27:05,329
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1214
01:27:24,874 --> 01:27:28,217
[SPEAKER_03]: and he had practiced before making cinematic versions of the game.

1215
01:27:28,598 --> 01:27:30,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So it should be interesting.

1216
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:36,145
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also made Audition, Chakushin Ari and one of Loki's favorites, Ichi the Killer.

1217
01:27:37,186 --> 01:27:38,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Ichi the Killer is awesome.

1218
01:27:38,527 --> 01:27:42,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So he should be very excited about this new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan.

1219
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:46,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if they tear some guy's face off and throw it against a wall, I mean, I don't see how that could be bad.

1220
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:47,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in Ichi the Killer.

1221
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:48,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Ichi the Killer.

1222
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:49,457
[SPEAKER_03]: E.G.

1223
01:27:49,477 --> 01:27:51,118
[SPEAKER_02]: the Killer is lost.

1224
01:28:11,929 --> 01:28:25,380
[SPEAKER_07]: A major UK retailer, HMV, their online store is taking pre-orders for PlayStation 3s, but you have to also purchase a 4GB PSP pack, so you'll be paying a total of £675.

1225
01:28:29,727 --> 01:28:37,531
[SPEAKER_07]: They're sending an email out that will say you become one of the lucky few who can pick up the PlayStation 3 at launch.

1226
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:47,736
[SPEAKER_07]: The quote says, at hmv.co.uk, we've been working with Sony to offer up to 5,000 customers an incredible deal when you buy the new Sony 4GB PSP.

1227
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:53,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone who takes advantage of this offer will get priority over other hmv.co.uk customers for the PlayStation 3.

1228
01:28:54,219 --> 01:29:01,726
[SPEAKER_07]: The deal also includes two PSP games, Kills and Liberation and Gangs of London for the price of $6.74.99.

1229
01:29:04,288 --> 01:29:12,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they expecting the same mass hysteria over there in the UK that they had over here at first, which then after Christmas just kind of dropped off like a rock?

1230
01:29:12,475 --> 01:29:15,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's the kind of shit we saw them doing over here when it came out.

1231
01:29:16,178 --> 01:29:18,080
[SPEAKER_07]: People went crazy and then realized the Wii was better.

1232
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:23,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1233
01:29:23,326 --> 01:29:24,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Wii is better.

1234
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:26,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the Wii had Zelda and all that.

1235
01:29:26,767 --> 01:29:29,908
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one good PlayStation 3 game out right now.

1236
01:29:30,908 --> 01:29:31,008
[SPEAKER_03]: One.

1237
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:33,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope more comes out.

1238
01:29:33,349 --> 01:29:43,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not that I want to see Sony fail, and it's not that I want to make fun of Sony, and I love my PlayStation 2, but goddamn, Sony.

1239
01:29:43,612 --> 01:29:44,512
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making it easy for us.

1240
01:29:44,632 --> 01:29:45,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1241
01:29:45,232 --> 01:29:46,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, God.

1242
01:29:47,992 --> 01:29:51,515
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have not touched our PS3 in, I want to say, about two weeks now.

1243
01:29:52,235 --> 01:29:58,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only reason we actually put anything in it was to watch Talladega Nights, and that was Dan, and I left the room.

1244
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry I grew up in Alabama.

1245
01:30:02,422 --> 01:30:06,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Canogram says, I hadn't played Zelda in two to three weeks due to virtual console.

1246
01:30:07,064 --> 01:30:09,366
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I forgot to say at the top of the show, I've been playing virtual console.

1247
01:30:09,386 --> 01:30:10,547
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other stuff I've been playing this week.

1248
01:30:10,587 --> 01:30:11,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart 64.

1249
01:30:12,488 --> 01:30:12,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1250
01:30:13,068 --> 01:30:14,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Still stuck on our type.

1251
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:17,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Zelda Link to the Past as well.

1252
01:30:17,222 --> 01:30:17,683
[SPEAKER_06]: R-Type.

1253
01:30:17,863 --> 01:30:20,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Zelda Link to the Past.

1254
01:30:20,424 --> 01:30:21,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Contra 3.

1255
01:30:22,165 --> 01:30:23,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I can play that on my Nintendo.

1256
01:30:25,847 --> 01:30:26,527
[SPEAKER_06]: R-Type.

1257
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:29,289
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Jamie and I have 50,000 consoles in my house.

1258
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:31,830
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all collecting dust too.

1259
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:32,731
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually might sell some.

1260
01:30:33,391 --> 01:30:33,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1261
01:30:33,951 --> 01:30:34,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1262
01:30:34,932 --> 01:30:36,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to find money.

1263
01:30:36,433 --> 01:30:38,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a Virtual Boy for no good reason.

1264
01:30:38,614 --> 01:30:39,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a Virtual Boy?

1265
01:30:39,334 --> 01:30:41,055
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to buy mine?

1266
01:30:41,075 --> 01:30:41,055
$5.

1267
01:30:41,095 --> 01:30:41,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously?

1268
01:30:41,675 --> 01:30:42,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go get $5 right now.

1269
01:30:43,036 --> 01:30:43,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1270
01:30:43,877 --> 01:30:44,317
Seriously?

1271
01:30:44,795 --> 01:30:46,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go get $5 right fucking now.

1272
01:30:48,237 --> 01:30:49,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have some change in my room.

1273
01:30:50,358 --> 01:30:50,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow.

1274
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:51,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take it for $6.

1275
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:51,539
$10?

1276
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:53,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I hear $10?

1277
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:54,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, bitch.

1278
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll buy $10.

1279
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:56,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I put down $10.

1280
01:30:56,801 --> 01:30:56,301
$15.

1281
01:30:56,841 --> 01:30:57,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we hear $15?

1282
01:30:57,182 --> 01:30:58,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that.

1283
01:30:58,162 --> 01:30:58,682
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not worth $15, no.

1284
01:30:58,983 --> 01:30:59,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1285
01:30:59,323 --> 01:30:59,103
$10!

1286
01:30:59,363 --> 01:31:02,144
