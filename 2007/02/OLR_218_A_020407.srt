00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is episode number 218 for this, February the 4th of 2007.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yo.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How you doing, Jamie Summers?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm doing.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Been an interesting week.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Been an interesting week? Yeah, I could say the same.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's been a very interesting week. We'll get into that in a minute.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Say hello as well though to Tech Master Loki.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hello.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How you doing, Loki?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm doing good.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Did you have an interesting week as well?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Alright.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, for those of you that are new to our program, we just want to say hello and welcome.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We were lucky enough to have a story of ours on the front page of DIG this week.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So we're thinking we might have got a couple new people thanks to that.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a big howdy hello to you.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you for choosing to support independent podcasting, first off.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And just so you know, we're a show made up of three friends who have kind of become friends to each other just through doing this program.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We sit here and we talk about games every week and the way that you would sit down and talk at a dinner after you've gone to an arcade from a long night of playing DDR or Tekken or Derby Owners Crack, whatever it is that you play at the arcade.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just kind of sitting around and chatting like old friends.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And sometimes we're lucky enough to break news here first because we have some inside contacts thanks to Loki being in the distribution world, among other things.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But sometimes we're not always going to break the news.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We're just going to talk about it and give you our viewpoints on it.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're dedicated to giving every gamer a voice and we do that partially through our chat room as well.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A big hello to the chat room.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Joining us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com when we tape live here on Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Also we have our Skype line which we'll open up later in the program. It's also an 800 number you can give us a call at and share your thoughts.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We'll open that up later.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So that way all you guys have a voice.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All right.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And of course tonight they're talking a little bit in chat room about the Super Bowl which is going on right now.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I guess between the three of us we kind of don't really keep tabs on what's going on in the Super Bowl.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But I will say the Puppy Bowl was awesome and I'm kind of sad I missed the kitty half time.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But the Puppy Bowl is kind of boring.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But the Puppy Bowl is cute because they have the bowl.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I like the bowl cam.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You know what? They need like a Madden for puppies.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Would you buy Puppy Bowl the game?

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There was a Japanese TV show that I used to have a few copies of on tape.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It was called Uri Nari Land and they had dog soccer and baby soccer and cow soccer.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The closest I've come is Mega Man soccer I'm sorry to say.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I was thinking the Puppy Bowl would be something like that and it wasn't.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It was cute but it was just three hours of cuteness.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Puppies playing.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I was sitting in here working on some last minute things for the show

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and I just hear out in the living room dark soccer and my roommate going.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That was your roommate that was not me.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No it was you.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Puppies.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It was both of you.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All right, well let's get into the game stuff.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:48,360
I was on my ass in this chair, playing Tech in Dark Resurrection on PSP, and I'm gonna

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,040
get Dancing Blade, because I played the old one, and that was pretty cool.

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,240
I actually did not play any Cooking Mama this week.

67
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,520
Are you in a 12-step recovery program?

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,360
No, I'm in a, oh my god, my midterms are next week type of thing, so I've been studying

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
muscle groups.

70
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,120
Well, I guess if I went back and played some Trauma Center, I'd be okay for class or something.

71
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,600
I loaned out my copy of Trauma Center to a friend of mine who just got a Wii, so I'm

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,720
sorry to say I don't have my version for you to practice on, but that's a fun game.

73
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
So fun.

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,880
I like the Trauma Center.

75
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,400
I've actually gotten pretty good at some of it, but it's still frustrating.

76
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,520
Can't I just rub them until they're better?

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,400
So yeah.

78
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
That's really doing it though.

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Alright.

80
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Loki, how was your gaming week?

81
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,320
I played more of the Crackdown demo, like, another three or four times yesterday.

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
I love that game.

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
I just can't wait for the full thing to come out.

84
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,920
You know, it's one of those games that I was like, well, you know, because everyone was

85
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,240
saying, oh, it's kind of the demo, they didn't like the demo or anything like that originally

86
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
when I was first hearing about it.

87
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,160
I was kind of like, well, you know, I don't know if I'm gonna like this.

88
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,400
I actually like it better because you can actually explore a lot more of the city.

89
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,840
I did climb to the top of the tower in the middle of the city, which is fun, difficult,

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,440
and a little bit, you know, a little bit frustrating at times because, you know, if you fall off

91
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,120
that thing, you're pretty dead because you're falling like 50 stories, but it's cool because

92
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,640
once I climbed to the top and I had like 10 seconds left, I jumped to my death trying

93
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,100
to land on another cop because that was funny, but yeah, it was great.

94
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,760
And then I tried out another demo, actually NBA Street Home Court, a little bit different

95
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,400
of a type of game that I'd normally play, but it's pretty cool.

96
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,960
It actually looks really good.

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,920
All the screenshots are definitely pretty accurate of how the game is.

98
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,720
It's pretty cool, kind of reminds me of NBA Jam a little bit because, you know, the players

99
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,080
are doing stuff that you would normally not see anyone doing in basketball, but it's pretty

100
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
fun.

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,760
It's not a game I'd be picking up, but, you know, definitely a fun game.

102
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,360
I really wish NBA Jam would just come back, you know, because NFL Blitz is kind of lame.

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,760
You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but NBA Jam was definitely one I could get

104
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
into.

105
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
That game was a lot of fun.

106
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
It really was.

107
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,160
I just love the old NFL Blitz, but this Blitz League shit's retarded.

108
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,800
Some comments from chat room regarding your comments on Crackdown.

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,760
Jeremy Todd 1 says, the grenade launcher in the Crackdown demo is so freaking awesome,

110
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,720
you can literally just keep blowing everyone up with a single button push.

111
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Flying flaming people equals automatic 10 out of 10 score.

112
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,600
Mr. Gohan wants to know, how did you get up there?

113
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,680
Jeremy How'd I get up there?

114
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Climbing.

115
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,400
Seriously, it's just climbing, you know.

116
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,400
If you keep climbing up the side of the building, you'll eventually get to this part where it's

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,680
kind of flat, then on one of the ends of the three towers, they have, like, scaffolding.

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,200
If you jump on the scaffolding, you can kind of make your way up a little bit more, but

119
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,480
you really need to have, like, you know, at least a third level on your, you know, jumping

120
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,920
and stuff in order to be able to reach some of that, but you can get pretty high.

121
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,780
It's pretty fun, and it's even more amazing, too, when you get that high, you can still

122
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,760
see all the cars and people walking down below.

123
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,000
I mean, that's pretty amazing, you know, compared to, like, Saints Row, which, you know, you

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,960
wouldn't see any of that stuff, stuff would be glitching out and stuff, but I can't wait.

125
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,680
I can't wait for Saints Row 2 whenever the hell that comes out.

126
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Crackdown!

127
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,800
That's going to hold me over for a long time.

128
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Hold you over until what?

129
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Oh, Grand Theft Auto?

130
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Is that what you're waiting for?

131
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Oh, yeah, Grand Theft Auto IV.

132
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Anything else?

133
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,120
No, actually, oh, I played Luminous a little bit, I beat some, I got some more achievements

134
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,320
playing the time attack stuff, and I think that's all I played, yeah, that's it.

135
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,440
Alright, well, my gaming week wasn't too thrilling because I'm still in my World of War Crack

136
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,280
mode, so I'm still playing there with the guild, which, by the way, if you're interested

137
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,860
in joining our guild, we have a few OLR listeners in there that I've been playing with and chatting

138
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
with, it's fun.

139
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,400
I was just on there about an hour before we went live tonight, and if you want to join,

140
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,860
there's more information on our forums, it's orangeonsready.com, click on forums, right

141
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,260
now we play on the Ravencrest server on the Horde side, for the Horde, anyway, it's fun.

142
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,200
So a lot of people are making their Blood Elves over there because it's a newer server.

143
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,680
But anyway, outside of War Crack, not a whole lot of other games per se, but I did finally

144
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,640
check out Xbox 360's movie marketplace, because when it first launched, there was really nothing

145
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,440
I wanted to see, but then they added a bunch of Lionsgate movies just like a week and a

146
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,660
half ago, it's kind of like the artsy, well, sometimes, sometimes they have big budget

147
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,480
films like Saw, and I guess The Descent was kind of up there, but usually it's like kind

148
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,620
of artsy films.

149
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,200
So there was a film on there that one of my friends had seen that said I'd probably like

150
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,240
called Hard Candy, which I decided to download in HD, just because I wanted to see how was

151
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,080
the HD delivery and everything, and well, the movie itself was kind of weird, I mean,

152
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,600
I guess it was good for like the first 40 minutes, then it was just like WTF, it was

153
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,320
kind of gross, but anyway, outside the movie, I mean, I realized that Microsoft can't do

154
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,400
anything about that, the quality wasn't too bad, I thought it was kind of weird, because

155
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,760
when you first start watching the movie, it actually continues to download the last portion

156
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,920
of the movie, so you can't really rewind or fast forward or any of that stuff for the

157
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,360
first little bit of the movie until I was about an hour in, then it finally finished

158
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,120
downloading the rest of the movie, so I could rewind, fast forward, whatever, and basically,

159
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,120
once you download the movie to your hard drive, you have 14 days to start watching it, and

160
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,720
then, once you press the play button and start watching it, you have 24 hours to finish it,

161
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,620
which you know, if I'm going to sit down and watch a movie, that was certainly ample time

162
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,860
for me to finish it, but just so you know before you download any of that stuff, picture

163
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,580
quality because I downloaded an HD was pretty good I don't know if HD gives me

164
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,980
anything that much more than DVD does I mean yeah it's a little crisper yeah the

165
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,940
colors stick out a little more but is it worth essentially six dollars that I'm

166
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,660
paying to download the HD movie to watch one time I don't know I don't know I

167
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,840
might be better off just getting the HD DVD player and getting a Netflix I don't

168
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,640
know yet so it's hard to tell too because hard candy wasn't exactly a movie

169
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,500
with lots of bang up special effects and things it would be easier maybe if I

170
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,480
downloaded something like Poseidon that might have more of that I don't know but

171
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,820
it wasn't bad I would use the service again because at least it wasn't having

172
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,820
the slowdown problems that the store did when it first launched whatever I guess

173
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,180
maybe the curiosity factor is settled down a lot and things it's easier to get

174
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,420
in there and download movies now so I I would recommend if there's a movie on

175
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,780
there that interests you you want to see how it looks download one try it for

176
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,860
yourself why not I also downloaded for free because it was for free for a

177
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,820
couple days the first episode of the Sarah Silverman program which is

178
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,260
hilarious but the audio is off a little bit as it because we also take my

179
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,460
roommate taped it on the DVR and then I was like oh we can download it'll be

180
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,500
like perfect quality and while the video quality was great the sound was off I

181
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,220
don't know if that was me or what the hell was going I don't mean the sound

182
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,100
was muted but the sound was like you know when the sound is like just a hair

183
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,820
off of the lips it just bugs the hell out of you because it looks like you're

184
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,940
watching an old karate movie or something yeah yeah it's bad so maybe

185
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:19,020
it's just my copy of it I don't know whatever going to the chat room and

186
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,300
seeing what the folks are saying there in the chat room let's see black boy

187
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,900
says God Shelley winters in HD no not that not the old ass Poseidon adventure

188
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,660
I mean the new one who then what the new one have in it it had was that guy it's

189
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,460
in them got it can you remember his name who's the guy that's a snake in revenge

190
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,180
of New York or whatever oh that's carousel carousals in it that's what it

191
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,660
is Mike W says that Rob is a movie snob yeah maybe a little bit I don't know

192
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,860
Mike W says Rob like only plays Xbox Live Arcade yeah lately that's what I've

193
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,060
been playing there hasn't been a whole lot released on discs that I've wanted

194
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,940
to play but I enjoyed heavy weapon I love luminous I love the Xbox Live

195
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,860
Arcade it's like those little little throwaway games with a little like

196
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,940
because I have gamer a DD if you've lived in the show long enough you know

197
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,140
that I never stick with one game for a long time with the exception of the few

198
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,900
MMOs I've played and even then I quit and go back and quit and go back all the

199
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,220
time so Xbox Live Arcade games are perfect for me but I do want to check

200
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,300
out fusion frenzy which is kind of the same thing it's like 40 minigames in one

201
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,140
but it's an actual release game as opposed to Xbox Live Arcade and I'm

202
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,980
definitely looking forward to some of the Xbox Live Arcade news we have coming

203
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,940
later in the show but first we're gonna get into the show tonight we have a no

223
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,420
right well let's get into some gaming news and we're gonna start it off as I

224
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,900
mentioned at the top of the show we were very lucky to have our coverage of dance

225
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,060
dance revolution hottest party hit dig this week so thank you guys very much

226
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,580
for giving us a dig on there and as we reported we were lucky enough to attend

227
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,060
Konami gamers day earlier this week and we'll tell you more about it throughout

228
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,900
the rest of the show here but of course you know since our show started many

229
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,300
years ago as a Bamani DDR music game type station we know a lot of our

230
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,080
longtime fans are very interested in this title and heck even some of you

231
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,300
guys who've come to listen to Orange Lounge Radio when we just tapped into

232
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,160
gaming in general you still can understand the dance dance revolution is

233
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,240
really up there it's the top if not one of the top maybe next to guitar here I

234
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,340
don't know music game franchises that people really follow so I think a lot of

235
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,460
people expected the DDR was going to come to the Wii it was just a matter of

236
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,220
time I don't know about you I wasn't expecting to hear it this early like I

237
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,100
kind of thought we would see it maybe like doesn't seem still early in the

238
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,620
Wii's life for us to be getting this game I don't know maybe maybe so I was

239
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,100
surprised at the timing of it I thought we wouldn't hear anything about it till

240
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,140
at least e3 if not 2008 but it looks like we are getting it this year at

241
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,860
least a cool point because it's not gonna be another PlayStation 2 version

242
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,860
this year I would think I don't know they didn't show one off so that would

243
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,580
that would imply that but I don't know there's a lot of stuff they didn't show

244
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,420
off economy gamers day so they didn't say anything about Metal Gear Solid 4

245
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,180
except kind of cock tease us with a release date and then not say anything

246
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,740
that was stupid they knew they knew me soon I was like that's such a they knew

247
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,740
we all wanted to know it they didn't say anything about Silent Hill origins I'm

248
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,100
wondering if that game got cancelled cuz coding on it's still it's still like

249
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,820
it's pushed back that's for sure Silent Hill now Silent Hill 5 was the game I

250
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,380
was thinking we were gonna see I cuz you know though we're gonna get a Silent

251
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,140
Hill 5 at some point the first four games are phenomenal there's the movie

252
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,860
and everything duh we have to get a Silent Hill 5 at some what nothing I

253
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,060
think economy gamers dating up about Silent Hill 5 doesn't that make you sad

254
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,180
dark soccer because I was looking forward to Silent Hill 5 not really why

255
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,620
because that sort might leave it to a much bigger announcement coming up later

256
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,380
ah so you think Silent Hill 5 is worthy of a press conference all on its own why

257
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,100
not okay fair enough maybe when they announce the sequel to the movie I don't

258
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,980
know well anyway a three new songs in DDR hottest party lips of an angel gonna

259
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,420
make you sweat and will buy a Naoki what's interesting with that is that the

260
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,220
teaser trailer teased that it was a brand new soundtrack from the ground up

261
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,060
and so it's kind of interesting because you have this lips of names are gonna

262
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,220
be sweat and then there was a weird cover of breakdown in there yes I

263
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,740
remember both of myself and Mel B we right when the trailer annual that was a

264
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,700
really weird version of that song it's like what the fuck was that and they

265
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,820
talk about a soundtrack spanning four decades worth of music so I'm wondering

266
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,220
if this isn't kind of like the direction we're gonna see for the soundtrack an

267
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,260
all-new soundtrack of like remade songs of the last four decades along with a

268
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,620
few economy originals like this will bow Naoki

269
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:06,380
uh-huh we'll see it was interesting a little demo now of course it's on the

270
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,920
ween you gotta wonder how's the Wii remote gonna be used and yes you use the

271
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,220
Wii remote in the game they add a little basically I think this is more of a

272
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,740
concept build what we were looking at at this at the show because it basically

273
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,060
looked like DDR supernova but blue and then like every so often an arrow would

274
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,620
be replaced with this little icon that kind of looked like the Wiimote and then

275
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,760
uncheck the other cause symbol kinda it looked kind of weird and you that was

276
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,020
just your indication of shake you could do anything you want but they were very

277
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,360
I mean Jason Enos who's like the producer for this that was there demo in

278
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,540
the game and he said this is he emphasized over and over again this is a

279
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,380
very early concept thing we just want people to know it's coming we're still

280
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:48,220
really experimenting with what the we thing is going to do by the way I want

281
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,740
to mention something I didn't post anywhere on the site since Jason Enos

282
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,100
was there I took an opportunity to ask him a couple questions and I asked him I

283
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,020
said so how about DDR in the arcade and anything you want to say about DDR in

284
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,740
the arcade and he of course didn't really have anything to say I said what

285
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,980
about that rumor there's an expansion coming to supernova with you know the

286
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,100
20 30 20 30 or more songs he said he didn't know anything about it which

287
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,700
could be the polite way of saying no comment I don't know but rest assured

288
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,580
those rumors that you've seen floating around the other DDR sites Jason says

289
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,140
you don't know about it so that's what I'm going with I'll trust him that's

290
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,100
interesting that is I was reading there's some rumored release dates and I

291
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,420
haven't heard anything about this yet but that was it that stupid Codemasters

292
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:36,300
dance factory game was gonna be coming to the Wii in March before DDR oh

293
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,340
interesting but I mean I can tell you right now the games could be ass just

294
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,180
because the last one is ass I'm looking at some comments from chat room Jeremy

295
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,340
Todd once says Silent Hill origins is now the next Duke Nukem forever god I

296
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,140
hope not jaded says Silent Hill there won't be a five I doubt that those those

297
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,620
are big where there's got four sold pretty well didn't it I'll see why there

298
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,820
wouldn't be a five all right Rama says DDR supernova 2 in the groove dream on

299
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,060
dream I'm sorry I've been following the Bahmani scene for a long time in the

300
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,500
groove songs are not is not coming to DDR and I I don't I don't have any

301
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,860
insider knowledge to back that up granted but just having followed Konami

302
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,740
in the biases as long as I have it's not happening stop getting your hopes up

303
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,860
about it because you're gonna be disappointed I'm sorry not happening

304
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,700
once that ruling passed in the groove was officially dead so anyway that away

305
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,100
from that back to DDR on the week that's what we really want to talk about yeah

306
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,500
what I thought was interesting is the selection screen you could use the Wii

307
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,860
remote to like point-and-click at songs you wanted to play and it had a cute

308
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,860
little DDR arrow icon I don't know just it's a long memory right now yeah I'm

309
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,060
sure I'm sure what did you think look because you actually got to play it what

310
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:50,100
did you think actually playing the game did it feel right was it weird it was

311
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,940
like DDR hands and feet mode but it's just it's it let me put it this way the

312
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,020
hands and feet mode was awkward this is just as equally as awkward at least as

313
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,780
it is right now and it's not it's just it doesn't it's almost like it doesn't

314
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,980
need to be there just because you know you supported the iToy you don't need to

315
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,300
have a hands and feet mode in that although the thing is though if they do

316
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,180
something like this they could do some really interesting stuff with it like

317
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,220
instead of you know have a whole section of the song that's all done with your

318
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,300
hands I mean that might be kind of cool that's what Jason was kind of implying

319
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,620
that they might want to do things where you do different motions like he

320
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,340
referenced Saturday Night Fever like the disco pose like there might be a symbol

321
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,820
that you have to do that kind of pose and that they could do like what was in

322
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,240
a samba de amigo that and that's what a lot of people are coming away from the

323
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,540
saying is that it sounds like it could be DDR mixed with samba de amigo and I

324
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,220
don't see any reason why that's not a possibility so I mean it right now it's

325
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,780
just it's still way too early it is and you know that there's DDR with possible

326
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,140
stuff I was able when I played it I thought it was it did feel like it

327
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,220
played a lot like hands and feet mode because none of this extra stuff was in

328
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,420
there but I felt it was a lot cleaner because the problem I have with the

329
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,660
itoy is the device just sucks yeah if you're not in the exact right lighting

330
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,300
it doesn't win that's not Konami's fault it's just the itoy sucks I'm sorry I've

331
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,100
not played one good thing with the itoy not one and you have to have the exact

332
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,660
right lighting to make it work and it never is right on DDR I don't know if

333
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,540
you have a house where you can get it to work every time but the nice thing about

334
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,100
playing this on the Wii was that it worked every time like it you you know

335
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,500
it you don't have to have the perfect white background in your house to get

336
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,140
the wiimote shaking to pick up so that's what I liked about it is that and it

337
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,380
didn't matter where my hands or feet where I could kind of do it wherever so

338
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,700
that was kind of fun so I I had fun with it and it certainly posed to I mean I

339
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,860
was struggling on medium level difficulty songs you know so it

340
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,780
certainly adds a whole new challenge to it which I'm sure the purists will not be

341
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,220
happy about but DDR needs to evolve I did find it interesting though that all

342
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,260
the dance pads were just the GameCube dance pads I think you know in speculating

343
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,700
that DDR was going to come out on the Wii I wondered how they were gonna do

344
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,340
the wireless pad without lag and it never occurred to me duh just use the

345
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,660
GameCube pads because there's GameCube controllers on the thing and looks like

346
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,100
that's what they're doing because that's what in the trailer you could see

347
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,900
clearly that even the non Mario pads they use in the trailer were just plug

348
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,060
in yeah the GameCube slots anyway just really quite wanted to quickly say about

349
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:23,020
DDR Wii before we move on also it's going to feature an updated battle mode

350
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,100
a support mode where I know they talked about they really want this to be the

351
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,220
family DDR they want this to be the game that mom dad kid brother sister all play

352
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,660
together and they they're gonna have a mode in this where you actually talk to

353
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,140
each other and you have to do the same pose at a certain part in the song they

354
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,220
know they want that in one type of mode so you have to communicate with each

355
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,180
other say okay we're gonna disco we're gonna disco whoa we're gonna sprinkler

356
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,900
Roger Rabbit I don't know whatever so that's gonna be interesting I think if

357
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,580
nothing else now also free play mode and work workout mode no sign of edit mode

358
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,660
but I don't see how you couldn't have a DDR right now without edit mode so I

359
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,800
don't see why that wouldn't be coming for those that want to edit the Wii

360
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,180
things into it yeah it's way early it's probably just a technical issue for

361
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,860
right now so if you want to see more on it we even have some pictures we took

362
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,820
some pictures of the trailer which hasn't come out anywhere else yet and

363
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,540
there's a picture behind the scenes there you can see Jason a demoing it

364
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,700
for some girl from some unknown press site who's giggling over it you see all

365
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,820
that on our site and we have the only picture of the interface as it is now

366
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,380
but that's going to change the interface is going to change that was obviously a

367
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,820
temporary interface but that's all at orange lounge radio.com if you want to

368
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,700
see more information on that so Loki what what else did you see economies

369
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,620
gamers say that you enjoyed there's actually quite a few games there and I

370
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,260
got to try a little bit of everything one of the first games I tried was time

371
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,380
ace which in the preview kind of reminded me of time pilot because you're

372
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,540
playing in kind of different time periods and you're flying planes and

373
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,700
stuff the game itself actually reminded me the graphics remind me of prop cycle

374
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,020
I don't know if you remember that old arcade game I freaking love prop cycle

375
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,540
that's like one of the most underrated arcade games ever it reminded me very

376
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,220
much of that it weren't you big on prop cycle Jamie I remember you looked at an

377
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,020
M car K when it came out yeah the prop cycle is a bomb and you fan yourself I

378
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,780
played it for free I love so much anyway sorry anyways but on the game kind of

379
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,380
reminds me of at least the level that they had you try out where you kind of

380
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,380
playing this biplane thing to be honest the game itself could very much be wing

381
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,020
island on the DS I mean you're just you know doing different missions you're

382
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,300
fighting you know planes in the air I mean it seemed pretty solid you know

383
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,540
graphics are a bit rough but I guess that's you know that's just a DS for you

384
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,220
what is it you were saying something about you thought this was a sequel to

385
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,620
time pilot I thought it was a sequel to time pilot that's I mean it makes it

386
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,140
time ace time pilot meaning both of them are biplane games where you're fighting

387
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,500
in different you know time periods it seems logical to me and interesting I

388
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,940
just know I for some stupid reason to not make that connection I don't know I

389
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,900
just thought that's you know what they were doing I could be wrong they could

390
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,900
just be kind of a something that's almost identical and has almost the same

391
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,520
name whatever another game I did play though was coded arms contagion for the

392
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,580
PSP and I can tell you having played the first one it still sucks and you know

393
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,940
it's very unfortunate because it looks like they really tried to make the game

394
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,980
load better it's just unfortunately for the PSP first-person shooters just suck

395
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,060
on the PSP and that's just because they don't have two analog sticks it's really

396
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,860
hard it's real sluggish to move around if maybe if they increase how fast you

397
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,740
turn and stuff in it might be a little bit better but it's just those four face

398
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,260
buttons using as like a second analog stick it's just not good at all that's

399
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,940
really unfortunately a problem with the system but you know the game itself

400
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,740
looks pretty good I mean it's okay I just I didn't have very much fun with it

401
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,620
but you know what can you what can you say yes if you're used to playing you

402
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,820
know first-person shooters on the PSP then great maybe one to check out

403
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,060
definitely a good thing that they didn't do the random levels like they did the

404
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:03,260
first one but it kind of reminds me like a Metroid Prime type game Dewey's

405
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,020
adventure I know we saw the video of that looked okay kind of reminded me of

406
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,140
Kirby a little bit actually reminded me of one of their own titles it reminded

407
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:18,340
me of the Koron Koron I can't say that Korin pa Korin pa I can't say that word

408
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,340
it reminded me of Korin pa kind of like in the way that you tilted the

409
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,860
environment around but yet with this additional angle of changing the

410
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,580
temperatures to change Dewey from a liquid to a solid and from a solid to a

411
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,420
gas and what were they saying something about like when he's in solid form he

412
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,580
damages enemies more but he's more difficult to control when he's in liquid

413
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,900
form he can't really damage enemies but he's easier to control and then when

414
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,780
he's in gas form he just kind of goes wherever he just but he can't really do

415
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,960
anything else it's very interesting the way you change temperature and it's

416
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,020
supposed to change the environments completely so it's a nice thing you can

417
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,740
actually shake the controller certain ways to you know cause earthquakes or to

418
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,380
like cause wind and stuff like that so that's kind of unique for a platform

419
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,380
game.

420
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,980
When they were about to announce Dewey�s Adventure and they were showing the trailer

421
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,740
and everything and they didn�t tell us what the name of it was yet, didn�t you think

422
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,020
we were about to see Elibits 2?

423
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,180
I totally thought that�s what was coming.

424
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,500
The cut scene for the artwork is exactly the same.

425
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,280
It�s the same style, they got the same people that did all the arts in Elibits to do this

426
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
game.

427
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,340
It even had glowing creatures that were small.

428
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,300
All they�re doing is remaking Elibits all over again.

429
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,420
But then when we actually heard about the concept, it was nothing like Elibits at all.

430
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
No, it�s not.

431
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,900
But I kind of thought it would be interesting to keep it in the same universe but just have

432
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,980
it be a different thing, because it�s almost like the same art style.

433
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,660
I could see it later on, they�re having a box set from this guy, it�s like a bunch

434
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,140
of different stories that are kind of in the same universe because they all seem to be

435
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,100
told the same way with really bad dialogue over the entire cut scene.

436
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
It was cute.

437
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
It was cute.

438
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
But yeah, it was okay.

439
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,820
There are tsunami props for original stuff with that in Elibits and everything.

440
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,180
How easy would it have been to have just ported Castlevania to the Wii where you use the Wii

441
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,180
as the whip?

442
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Whoopee-doo!

443
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,060
But they�re coming up instead with original things for the Wii, which I think is kind

444
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,060
of cute.

445
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,220
But I want a Castlevania game where you use the Wii as the whip.

446
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,800
I know we all want that.

447
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
We don�t need it right now.

448
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,420
We have this other Castlevania thing to look forward to we�re going to talk about in

449
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
a minute.

450
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
We don�t need another 3D Castlevania though.

451
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
That�s true.

452
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,420
Castlevania 64 still burns a little bit.

453
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,480
Hey now, we have 3D Castlevanias that aren�t that bad.

454
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
But they�re not that good either.

455
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,540
Castlevania 64 made my soul cry.

456
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,260
Compared to Symphony of the Night, everything since looks like poop.

457
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,260
I�m sorry.

458
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
No, no, no.

459
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,740
Compared to freaking Rondo of Blood, everything is poop.

460
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,740
We�ll get there in a minute, sweetie.

461
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
We�ll get there in a minute.

462
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
I know.

463
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,260
Well, Symphony of the Night was great, but it wasn�t a true Castlevania in my opinion.

464
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
It was like Metroid featuring�

465
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
Then fart in words.

466
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Then fart in words.

467
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
Then fart in words.

468
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,260
It was Metroid featuring the Castlevania characters.

469
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,660
I�m not saying it was a bad game.

470
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,820
It�s one of my favorites ever, but it was Metroid featuring Castlevania characters.

471
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,140
But it was the best thing I�ve ever played, one of the best games I�ve ever played in

472
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,140
my life.

473
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,900
And granted, I think the best video game ever made.

474
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,860
I don�t know how many times I�ve said this on the show, but I think the greatest

475
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,620
video game of all time is Super Metroid.

476
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,620
Dude, Metroidvania.

477
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,260
And so of course I love Symphony of the Night.

478
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,060
Junami said it best, though.

479
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,060
Metroidvania.

480
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
Whatever.

481
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,060
Anyway.

482
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,740
Anyway, so another game that wasn�t like Metroid, Hellboy, was actually pretty cool.

483
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,500
It�s kind of a beat-em-up type of game, of course, based on the Hellboy comic.

484
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,660
It looks really good from what I�ve seen so far, and they had one level that they were

485
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,940
demoing there at the moment.

486
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,700
And it was kind of cool.

487
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,580
Definitely a lot of detail in there, and it�s kind of cool you can go around ripping heads

488
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:45,420
off of little demons and throw them at them and stuff like that, and the entire environment

489
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,820
was pretty destructible.

490
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,240
So I think it definitely looks like a better game, definitely a lot better than their last

491
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,700
brawler that came out, so it should be good.

492
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,340
The other one, Wing Island.

493
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:06,380
Wing Island on the Wii actually could very well be a sister game to Pilotwings.

494
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,660
It pretty much is Pilotwings from what I�ve seen, and also once again kind of the same

495
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,200
art style as Prop Cycle.

496
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,540
Very simple graphics, but it�s fun.

497
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,820
You play a squadron of biplanes and you get a bunch of different missions from finding

498
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:29,460
lost cows to delivering goods to putting out fires and stuff like that.

499
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,420
So definitely kind of the same feel as a Pilotwings game.

500
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,340
I�m looking at chat trying to answer some questions.

501
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,060
Travis Donovan for Prez in �08 asks, �How did Rob get an Elibit for his 360 Gamer picture?�

502
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,060
You�re seeing a lot of people on Xbox do this now, and it�s all thanks to the Xbox

503
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,260
Webcam, and the way I got an Elibit is that I got one of the little stuffed Elibits from

504
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,240
GameStop even though I didn�t pre-order the game, but I got that and I just put it

505
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,300
up against a white background and took a picture with the Xbox Cam, because you can do custom

506
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,780
gamer pics with the Xbox Live Webcam.

507
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,620
I saw somebody else on my friend�s list, I want to say Rob Way or one of our listeners

508
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,260
has like a glowing Wii logo as his gamer picture.

509
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,620
A lot of people are doing cute things like that.

510
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,100
For a while I had a Mario Kart as my background because you can import themes from pictures

511
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,380
on your computer, so you can do fun little customizable things with your 360 that kind

512
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,380
of make you go, �What?�

513
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,380
I haven�t bothered.

514
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,180
I just have a perfect dark.

515
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,180
That�s fine.

516
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,620
And the one that the public sees, because you only see the camera pictures if you�re

517
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,740
on the friend�s list, but what do I have?

518
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,060
I think I just have one of the Pac-Man ghosts or something.

519
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,300
I change it almost all the time.

520
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,780
I change it like every week.

521
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,620
It�s like my MySpace.

522
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,900
You got to change it all the time to keep it current.

523
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Rob, look.

524
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
What?

525
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,380
Oh, you have Pac-Man background on your phone.

526
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,380
That�s cute.

527
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,380
It was a downloadable thing.

528
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,660
Did you pay money for that?

529
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,660
Yeah.

530
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,660
I was bored.

531
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
Loser.

532
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
When I�m bored, I buy stuff.

533
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,660
All right.

534
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,660
Like most women.

535
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
Hey!

536
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,660
Hey, hey, hey.

537
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
You�re mad because it�s true.

538
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Can you stop that right now?

539
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,660
Hey, hey, hey.

540
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Yikes.

541
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:07,020
I just got a bottle thrown at me.

542
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,020
You bitch.

543
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,020
All right.

544
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,020
Rob.

545
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
Rob Hart.

546
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,020
Bleeding.

547
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,020
It bleeds for you.

548
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,380
Bleeding black deafness from your heart.

549
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,380
All right.

550
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,500
Anyway, let�s talk about Castlevania.

551
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,580
This is something Jamie and I can agree on.

552
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:26,300
They showed Castlevania the Dracula X Chronicles for the PSP.

553
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,580
It�s going to be our first Castlevania game that we have on the PSP.

554
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,700
What�s interesting is that elements of it are new, but it�s still kind of an old game.

555
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,260
Basically, what the Dracula X Chronicles are is that you�re going to have this old game,

556
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,340
Rondo of Blood, which they said has never been in the U.S. before.

557
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,140
Never.

558
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:50,020
It hasn�t, but I can�t stop thinking about Castlevania V. Even though that game was ass,

559
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:55,060
I mean, really, that game was like the worst Castlevania game they ever made next to 64.

560
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,540
Well, yeah, but in Japan�

561
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,220
Actually, I would rather play Castlevania 64 than Castlevania V.

562
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,140
In Japan, by the way, it was released as Dracula XX.

563
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,140
Right.

564
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,140
Well, so they kind of�

565
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
Or death�

566
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,660
Or death, but I mean, after you got past the first stage, a lot of it was different, so

567
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,700
it wasn�t really the same game, but in a way, it was.

568
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,700
But anyway�

569
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,700
I�m watching the trailer.

570
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,780
That�s as much as we got of Rondo of Blood previously.

571
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,540
Well, now we are going to get not only the classic Rondo of Blood game on the PSP, but

572
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,820
they�re redoing it with Upped Graphics, and that�s what they showed�

573
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,820
Oh, this is sexy.

574
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
I know.

575
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,820
That�s what they showed at the show.

576
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,220
I�m watching IGNs.

577
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,940
The whole first stage was playable, so we got to play that, and it was awesome.

578
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,060
Now, the thing you have to remember about Rondo of Blood is since�

579
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,060
Did we redo the intro?

580
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,060
Yes.

581
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
It�s all CG.

582
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,060
But is it still in Gothic German?

583
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,060
Yes.

584
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
I think so.

585
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
That thought.

586
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,060
I think.

587
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,060
It was hard to hear sound in there, but I think.

588
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Well, you remember, though, the show where I brought in my turbo duo and hooked it up

589
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
and played it on air.

590
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,060
That was in like 2003 or 2004.

591
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
It was a long time ago.

592
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,060
Yeah, that was a few years ago.

593
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
Yeah, I remember that.

594
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
I�ll bring it back one day.

595
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,460
But yeah, it was a sexy game.

596
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,460
It looks great.

597
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,420
I love, love, love the 2D with the 3D look.

598
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,860
I mean, the best thing I could compare it to is like if you�ve played Super Smash

599
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,540
Brothers Melee and you�ve played that mode where you like actually are in the Mario game,

600
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,940
but it�s like all 3D-ified even though it�s 2D, that�s what they did to Rondo of Blood

601
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,940
in this enhanced mode.

602
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,940
It�s great.

603
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,360
Okay, instant impressed points for me.

604
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,780
The game mechanics are the same as 2D.

605
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,540
Yeah, you can do the back flip.

606
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
Not just that.

607
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,940
I was checking the timing of the moves.

608
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,060
They�re exactly the same as the PC engine.

609
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,660
It did play a little weird from the Castlevania games I�m used to, but I understand that�s

610
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,300
because the controls handled a little different back then.

611
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,260
Also something you have to remember, since this was before Castlevania the Night, you

612
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,300
cannot just go anywhere you want.

613
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,480
It�s a little more like Castlevania 3 kind of with the branching.

614
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,420
You can kind of branch off in different directions, but that�s about it.

615
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,900
Well, the whole point of the different directions, and I think that for people who aren�t familiar

616
00:34:53,900 --> 00:35:00,220
with Rondo of Blood, is that your ending is affected by how you play the game.

617
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,740
You�ve got secret hidden parts.

618
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:09,860
For example, a lot of people were wondering who Maria was, who didn�t know any better.

619
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,980
She was actually playable in Rondo of Blood if you rescued her, and all of her attacks

620
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:21,180
were kind of stupid and cutesy little girly attacks, but they were also based after the

621
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,700
four gods of Chinese mythology, which I thought was pretty funny.

622
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,940
Oh, they redid the graphics for the Uber attacks in this game, too.

623
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,940
Oh, yeah.

624
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,940
It�s nice.

625
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,780
When you play the Saturn version, though, she has the same attacks, only just on a grander

626
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
scale.

627
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,180
Symphony of the Night will also be included.

628
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,300
That�s why this is the Dracula X Chronicles, so you get two versions of Rondo of Blood

629
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,420
and Symphony of the Night for one game, and that�s pretty awesome.

630
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,660
Now, they�re not redoing the graphics for Symphony of the Night, but they tease the

631
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,620
idea that they might add new areas.

632
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,380
They�re thinking about going back and retooling that game, and I�m theorizing, why not give

633
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,380
us the Saturn version?

634
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,140
I mean, I realize you can�t really port the Saturn, but give us what the Saturn version

635
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,860
had with Maria and that whole scenario.

636
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,980
That would be awesome.

637
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,180
Or the extra familiars.

638
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:12,620
For America, it would be an addition, because of course we didn�t get the Saturn version,

639
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,820
and as for the extra familiars, they were useless.

640
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,260
They took them out for a reason, and I�m pretty glad that they did, because they were

641
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,260
stupid.

642
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,620
All it was was another one of the same thing that you already had.

643
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,940
Dude, the item crash is hot.

644
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,380
Ravens Dolphin says, �I thought Dark Sakura would be more excited about this.� Okay,

645
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,540
when she first found out, I think I had to hold the phone about 10 inches away from my

646
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:37,540
ear, because I was going deaf from the squeaking.

647
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:44,500
Seriously, when I was watching the trailer, I sat there and actually thought to myself,

648
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,980
�Jamie�s going to piss herself.� I mean, literally, because if you�ve listened to

649
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:53,540
this show ever since Episode One, Jamie never shuts up about Rondo of Blood, and what a

650
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,540
great game it is.

651
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,540
It�s my copy while we were doing the show, remember?

652
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,540
I do.

653
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:03,260
Because I had gone to Anime Expo, and to put the long story short, my friend Krista owed

654
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,180
us money for our hotel room, so she came back from Japan with a copy of Dracula X for me

655
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,300
and called it even.

656
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,300
She owed us about $120 and gave us the game.

657
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,380
There you go.

658
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,860
So I have a pretty copy of the game.

659
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,060
Oh my God, this is so hot.

660
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,700
All right, we've got to get to some other games real quick, though, that I got to play.

661
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:23,460
Honeycomb Beat was another game I played on the DS.

662
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,380
What I like about this puzzle game is it�s kind of different from anything I�ve played.

663
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,700
It�s not like anything on PopCap.

664
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,460
It uses a stylus.

665
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,260
Basically the grid looks like there�s a puzzle mode and a progressive, you know, lines

666
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,540
going up the screen mode.

667
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:40,940
And basically when you tap the DS stylus on the screen, you flip over all the honeycombs

668
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,540
around the one that you hit, and so that�s kind of like how the puzzle works.

669
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,540
You�re trying to make lines of solid colors.

670
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,460
So it�s one of those easy concept but repeat playability.

671
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,180
Unfortunately there was no sound, so it�s hard for me to judge, like, does it have good

672
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,180
music?

673
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,900
I mean, is this game called Honeycomb Beat?

674
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,780
But it doesn�t really look like the music plays into it at all.

675
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,580
I think beat is just what they call tapping the screen to flip all the things over.

676
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,740
But I think if the price is right on this game, it could be a really good value buy,

677
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,740
I think.

678
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,020
It�s a good solid puzzle game that�s something we haven�t played before.

679
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,820
What�s also going to be a good value is Konami Classics.

680
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,540
The full name of this game on the Nintendo DS is Konami Classics Series Arcades Hits,

681
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,660
but we�ll just call it Konami Classics.

682
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,900
It�s 15 arcade games.

683
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Essentially it�s MAME on your DS.

684
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,060
I don�t know a better way to describe it.

685
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:31,740
Contra, Gradius, Circus Charlie, Puyan, like all these really, just frankly some obscure

686
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,740
games.

687
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,500
I remember Puyan because it was a game I played on the Commodore 64.

688
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,840
But get this, all the actions on the top screen, but when you pause the game or you tap things

689
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,340
on the bottom screen, not only does the bottom screen show you like the old arcade how to

690
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,020
play banners, which I think is great, like those old things you used to see, like when

691
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,500
you press the button, your thing will fly or whatever it is.

692
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:59,140
You can also flip the top screen so that you can play in like brain training style mode,

693
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,460
you know, where you�re holding the DS vertically.

694
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,940
So for a more vertically oriented game like Puyan, it works great because you don�t

695
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,140
really stretch the screen like you do if you�re trying to squish it into the more horizontal.

696
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,980
So I thought that was a really smart idea.

697
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,820
So that�s going to be a pretty good value, although granted if you�re an Xbox 360 owner,

698
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,540
a lot of these games you�ve seen on live or probably will be seen on live a little

699
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
later.

700
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,360
So a lot of those same games, but you get them on the go on the DS.

701
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:36,820
The next one I played is the game I can�t pronounce, Kororimpa, Marble Mania on the

702
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,860
Nintendo Wii.

703
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,540
Okay, you remember those old things they had back when we were kids, like those little

704
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,720
marble mazes where you would turn the knobs left and right to move the marble around,

705
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,260
but you didn�t want them to fall in the holes, like you tried to get it all the way

706
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
to the end?

707
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,560
That�s this game on the Wii.

708
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,740
You tilt the Wii remote to tilt the grid around, and so you could say in that sense it�s

709
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,220
kind of like Marble Blast Ultra because there�s, you know, like things that get in the way.

710
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:06,180
Like one round that we played had these giant scissors that closed on the course and you

711
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,660
didn�t want your ball to be in there.

712
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,060
And by the way, your ball could either be a little steel ball, you could be like a soccer

713
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,860
ball, a basketball, or a little penguin ball, of course that�s the one I had to play with.

714
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,420
Not a monkey ball, that�s a different game, I�m sorry, but this game is kind of like

715
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,260
monkey ball I guess, but I actually felt this game controlled a little better than monkey

716
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,260
ball did.

717
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,380
I felt the controls were a little more polished on this game.

718
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,940
So I think if it�s released at a lower price point than your typical Wii game, I think

719
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,940
it�ll be a good buy.

720
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,040
It has multiplayer, and what�s interesting about multiplayer is you only need one Wii

721
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,740
remote because one person uses the Wii, one person uses the nunchuck to control because

722
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,780
you don�t really use buttons or anything, you just tilt the Wiimote around, which is

723
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,720
kind of interesting.

724
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
That was that game.

725
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:54,980
And then Brooktown High was the last thing I played on the PSP, and Brooktown High is

726
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,060
kind of a dating sim game.

727
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,020
It�s Konami basically trying to, what�s that game they had in Japan, Tokenshi Memorial

728
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:08,300
or what the, Tokimeki Memorial that they have over in Japan, this is them trying this in

729
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,880
the U.S., because you know, Konami sometimes takes a while to try things out that are successful

730
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,620
in Japan over in the U.S., like DDR, but this is them trying that.

731
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:22,100
And I gotta be honest, I don�t know if this is something I�d buy, but I played another

732
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,700
dating sim called Sprung, which is one of the most god-awful games I�ve ever played

733
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,380
in my life on the Nintendo DS, and this game was leaps and bounds better than that.

734
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,860
So as far as dating sims go, it wasn�t that bad, but I just don�t know if it�s the

735
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,100
kind of game I�m into.

736
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,100
I did like it�s very customizable, you can kind of tell it, you know, what sort of girls

737
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,980
you like and what your personality is like, and you can do a guy dating girls or a girl

738
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,420
dating guys.

739
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,500
Of course you haven�t seen the guys dating guys, but I hear it might be an Easter egg,

740
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,820
but I didn�t get anything official from the developers of the game, but regardless,

741
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:02,020
you can kind of get your character�s personality built by attending class and by the dialogues

742
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,020
you have.

743
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,200
Like I know they were saying things about if you claim to be a philosopher to impress

744
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,780
a girl, she might call you out on it and ask you a question about philosophy, and if you

745
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,540
don�t know the answer, you�re kind of screwed and you lose cool points with her.

746
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,580
So there are little things like that that are kind of interesting.

747
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,180
And I also thought it was interesting that they had like booth babes there promoting

748
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Brooktown.

749
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,380
It was the only thing they kind of went out and did all these little cheers.

750
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,700
They really went all out for promoting that particular game at the show, which I thought

751
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
was interesting.

752
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Yes, Dark Sakura.

753
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,700
I�m totally cosplaying Annette�s outfit.

754
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,420
What, from Castlevania?

755
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,420
Yeah.

756
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,980
Thank you for having nothing to do with what I just said.

757
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,980
No, I�m sorry.

758
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,020
I was still looking at � they had some of the promo art up on GameSpy.

759
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,020
Oh, that�s fine.

760
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:52,700
I played the Brooktown a little bit, and you know, the only thing that�s disappointing

761
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:58,900
is having played all the hentai, you know, dating sims out there.

762
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,900
I did like �

763
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,900
What?

764
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,900
You wanted to see 16-year-old Titty?

765
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,900
That�s gross.

766
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,900
No, no.

767
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:11,980
I hope it had in the game � did you notice in the trailer they had kind of all the symbols

768
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,980
for sex in there, like the rocket taking off and like the oil well going �

769
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,980
Oh, yeah.

770
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,620
I hope the god that�s in the game �

771
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,420
They did this weird-ass thing in the trailer where suddenly pictures of the game were replaced

772
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:32,180
with these real-life imageries of a flower blooming and a rocket taking off and all this

773
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,180
crazy stuff.

774
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,300
I hope that like, you know, if you go in for a hot coffee or something like that, you know,

775
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,300
that �

776
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,540
This is going to be really random, but did you see the new Psycho?

777
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:47,540
Like remember when Gus Van Sant remade Psycho, like in 1998 or something, he remade Psycho?

778
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:53,820
One of the things he did in the death scenes, he added these random-ass clips that had nothing

779
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,820
to do with it.

780
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,580
Like when one person is getting stabbed, like you see a train going through a tunnel and

781
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,500
like the clouds moving by in the sky and it�s like all this random shit.

782
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,100
That�s what that reminded me of, I mean, seriously.

783
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:13,580
Anyway, that was Brooktown.

784
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:17,380
Is Chat Room giving you a hard time for being stuck on a Castlevania Dark Sakura?

785
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,380
I don�t care.

786
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:26,460
I did want to mention that Korinpa and Wing Island are both going to retail for $40 instead

787
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,460
of $50.

788
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,460
Oh, cool.

789
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,660
You picked that up through your distribution thing because they didn�t say that at the

790
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,660
show.

791
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,900
Yeah, I picked it up, you know, I think I mentioned it maybe last week, whatever, but

792
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,900
yeah.

793
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,860
Other games at the show that they had, Death Junior Science Fair of Doom on the DS.

794
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,460
I didn�t see it there.

795
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,460
It was playable.

796
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,740
It�s just not a lot of people were playing it.

797
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,300
Sorry, Death Junior fans.

798
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,220
Go Pets on the Nintendo DS, which is interfaces with the PC.

799
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,600
It�s a DS and PC game, which I thought was interesting.

800
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,420
It looked to me like a cross between Animal Crossing and Nintendogs.

801
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,460
Jamie, you�d probably love this game.

802
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,040
I might love this game.

803
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,040
It looked interesting.

804
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,100
The graphics looked a little rough, but it might have just been early stages.

805
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,380
They didn�t have it playable, just the preview.

806
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,420
Let�s see, you talked about Hellboy already, right?

807
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,420
Yeah.

808
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,540
Lost in Blue 2.

809
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,540
I didn�t like the first one.

810
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,540
I didn�t care about the second one.

811
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,540
Sorry.

812
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:22,900
I played some of the mini-games, like the goat milking and the � no.

813
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,660
It looks literally exactly like the first one.

814
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,540
Lunar Nights, which we told you about at the F1 with Konami BBQ.

815
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:37,740
It looks pretty cool still, and Winning Eleven Pro Evo Soccer 2007 looked awesome on the

816
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,740
360.

817
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,100
That game looked � even on the PS2, it looked good.

818
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,500
It looks awesome, but to be honest, I couldn�t get too excited about it because it�s coming

819
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,500
out next week.

820
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:50,300
I mean, it�s like, why even waste the space with this game?

821
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,740
I mean, it�s coming out next week.

822
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,740
I mean, who cares?

823
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,740
It looked good, though.

824
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,740
I mean, it�s really nice looking.

825
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,140
I don�t really play a lot of sports games.

826
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,540
I�m thinking about picking this one up.

827
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,540
It looks that good.

828
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,540
So, I don�t know.

829
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,540
We�ll see.

830
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:06,460
Anyway, but we can�t end this story without saying something about the games that weren�t

831
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,460
there.

832
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,060
Of course, Metal Gear Solid 4.

833
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,160
We thought maybe we�d see another trailer, a playable demo, maybe, but nothing, nothing.

834
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,040
No Silent Hill 5, no Silent Hill Origins, no Coded Arms on the PlayStation 3, which

835
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,620
means it is probably true that the game was canceled, we�re thinking, or at least heavily

836
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,620
delayed.

837
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:27,280
Silent Hill Origins on the PSP vanished into thin air, just like most things in Silent

838
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,280
Hill.

839
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,920
So, very interesting what they didn�t show as much as what they did show.

840
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,660
What do you think about the lineup of Konami Gamers� Day overall, low-key, from being

841
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,860
at the show?

842
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,240
Make more console games.

843
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,740
Stop with all the portable games.

844
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,740
It was very interesting.

845
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,180
Remember when the first marketing lady, or whoever was up there, and I apologize I don�t

846
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,560
have my notes in front of you, she said something about that that�s where all the money is

847
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,560
right now.

848
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,560
Is that DS and PSP?

849
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,860
No, that�s not exactly true though.

850
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,980
Make some more 360 games.

851
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,640
Granted, they had two last year.

852
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:14,680
They had Rumble Roses XX, and then the follow-up Smash Hit Bomberman, two really awesome games

853
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:21,280
for the 360, and then this year they�ve got Hellboy, which Hellboy looks good, I�ll

854
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,860
give them that, and DDR Universe.

855
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:30,160
But put some more games on the 360, oh and I guess Winning Eleven Soccer, that�s great.

856
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,160
So three games this year.

857
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,320
I definitely don�t think we�ve seen everything for the year though.

858
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,920
This is what we� I mean, if you think about last year, we�ve only seen what�s coming

859
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,920
out through like summer, except for some of the DDR Wii won�t be out until the end of

860
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,880
the year, and some of those other ones, but most of the stuff is going to be out in summer.

861
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,000
Most of what they showed was going to be out in March, and I think we already talked about

862
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
most of that, but I mean, oh goody, so we�re going to see Karaoke Revolution, whatever

863
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,920
the next one is, on the 360 come fall.

864
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,520
SSJ100Matt says, �Kojima probably wants to take his time with Metal Gear Solid 4 since

865
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,400
it�s his last one.� Yeah, he says that every time, dude.

866
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,960
He says that every time.

867
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,320
Bullseye is his last one.

868
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,760
There�s money to be made.

869
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
He�ll come back.

870
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,560
Jamie, I know unfortunately you didn�t get to go because of school, but what do you think

871
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,560
from the perspective of getting to read all about this?

872
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,480
Are you excited about all this, or beyond just Castlevania?

873
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,440
Dracula X.

874
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,000
I really don�t care about anything but Dracula X, really.

875
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Nothing in the world.

876
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,680
No Super Bowl, no Koro Impa.

877
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:42,240
That one sounds interesting, but my excitement over Dracula X is phenomenal, monumental,

878
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,800
bigger than a mole in terms of chemistry.

879
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,600
The creator of Castlevania was there.

880
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
I know it.

881
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
I hugged him.

882
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,600
He is still a fucking rock star.

883
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,600
I hugged him.

884
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,440
He came out and said, �I got a new hat.� Put on his new hat.

885
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,240
I have a picture of him, remember?

886
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,240
Yeah, I know.

887
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,240
We ran into him in E3.

888
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,240
I remember that.

889
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,240
I know.

890
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,240
I have all the celebrity run-ins.

891
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,480
I want to mention some things that slipped under that most people didn�t talk about.

892
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,360
There were some of the new lineups that they set for their plug-and-play stuff.

893
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,560
One of them, which was really big and I�m surprised I didn�t pick, Music Mania, which

894
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,160
I don�t know if it�s Beat Mania or pop music or something, but they have a three

895
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,240
and five key mode, and it�s basically a music rhythm game.

896
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Even I missed this.

897
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,920
It was on the CD with the press stuff.

898
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,240
We�ll have to do a write-up on that and look at that.

899
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,560
What about the track and field?

900
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:37,680
I thought they have a plug-and-go track and field guild, like a power pad, old NES type

901
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,680
thing.

902
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,680
Very interesting.

903
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,680
I guess you could burn a lot of calories with that.

904
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,680
That�s what they�re encouraging.

905
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:49,280
Speaking of burning calories and also DDR, there was a study going on by the West Virginia

906
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:55,800
Public Employees Insurance Agency where they had, it was a 24-week at-home clinical study

907
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:01,960
where they had people play DDR five days a week for at least 30 minutes and record their

908
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
activity.

909
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
They had to help monitors.

910
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,360
They were tracking weight, blood pressure, arterial function, fitness level, BMI, and

911
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,220
general attitude toward exercise.

912
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:19,440
These studies came by, and see, all their studies, by the way, were above the 85th percent

913
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,320
offer body mass index.

914
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:30,240
Not all of them lost weight, but almost all of them were showing improved arterial function.

915
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,160
They were showing general levels of well-being improved.

916
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:41,800
The biggest thing on here, I thought, was confidence and self-esteem improved.

917
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,860
They were more willing to participate in activity because they were so active and had more faith

918
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,400
in their bodies and their capabilities.

919
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,740
In other words, it took this big study to prove that exercise, no matter in what form

920
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:03,120
it is, DDR or weightlifting or whatever it is, exercise is healthy?

921
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:09,360
We know exercise is healthy, but I think that taking something that makes it really fun

922
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:17,760
because in the average person's mind, I think, they're not going to see, oh, I'm exercising.

923
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,800
I can tell you from personal experience, I get weirded out with the idea of going to

924
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,800
the gym.

925
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,680
There's something about that whole public sweating thing and the whole body builders.

926
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,340
There's all those muscular people and everything.

927
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,840
There's kind of that big fear that kind of goes with the gym and intimidation that comes

928
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
with that.

929
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,680
You don't have that when you're playing DDR because it's like just playing a video game.

930
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,240
Even though there's a whole different side of it, like if you're playing at the arcade,

931
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,400
people call you gay or whatever, but fuck them.

932
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,720
It's about the fact that you're having fun with it.

933
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,720
I haven't kicked out.

934
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,720
I know.

935
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
That was the good old days at Roseville Golf Land.

936
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
We all used to go.

937
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,400
But, anyway, DDR is kind of different than that.

938
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,680
DDR is just kind of like having fun.

939
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,200
It's like, hey, we're playing a video game, making asses of ourselves.

940
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,200
That's funny.

941
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,200
It's healthy.

942
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
I miss Para Para.

943
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,200
Oh, yeah.

944
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,680
That was a good one, too.

945
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,880
I think the Para Para was more of a good aerobic workout than just DDR is because you

946
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,680
move in your arms with it.

947
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,680
It's a lot more.

948
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,000
Well, maybe that's what they hope to accomplish with this Wii thing.

949
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,920
Well, at any rate, there's a little bit more to this that I think is cool is the Office

950
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,200
of West Virginia Governor.

951
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,800
Actually, it looks like there's an association with the Department of Education and a few

952
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:33,240
other facilities, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield, are giving some financial support

953
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:39,920
to eventually lead this into DDR games, training PE teachers, and promoting DDR clubs in West

954
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,440
Virginia public schools.

955
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,440
And Konami gets all the profits, but that's okay because it keeps new DDR games coming

956
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,160
out at home, and as long as they stay innovative, hey, they're fine by me.

957
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:54,000
I just laugh for all those people who say, oh, DDR won't work in America.

958
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,960
I bet you feel so stupid now.

959
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,160
Well, you know what?

960
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,440
This news is so huge that they even covered it on the national news.

961
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,440
Did you hear that?

962
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,440
Really?

963
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,440
Yes.

964
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,440
I have a clip.

965
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,440
Hold on.

966
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,880
Researchers in West Virginia announced Friday the results of a study that suggests playing

967
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,920
the video game Dance Dance Revolution improves the health of overweight kids, though not

968
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,720
as much as its rival game, Hamburger on a String.

969
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,720
Okay.

970
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,840
Obviously, that was from Saturday Night Live.

971
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,880
It's still kind of funny, nonetheless, to see a little DDR joke make its way into Weekend

972
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,880
Update there.

973
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,880
I like Hamburger on a String.

974
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,880
And who doesn't love?

975
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,680
I miss Kevin Nealon doing the Weekend Update.

976
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,920
Yeah, but I love Amy Poehler.

977
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
I love her.

978
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,920
She's fine.

979
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,920
Not as good as Tina Fey, but I love her.

980
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,920
She was with Upright Citizens Brigade.

981
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
But anyway.

982
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Hamburger on a String.

983
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,920
Ha!

984
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,920
I miss Chevy Chase, too.

985
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
I know.

986
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,000
So, you know, we all know that the PlayStation 3 resembles a George Foreman grill or a grill

987
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
of some sort.

988
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah.

989
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,560
In fact, people have gone as far as making it into an actual grill.

990
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:07,000
Well, now there's this one retailer in Akihabara that's selling some unofficial 6-axis soy

991
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,760
sauce to go with the PlayStation 3 grill.

992
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,720
That's kind of a joke.

993
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:19,960
They've basically rebranded some of the Bulldog brand soy sauce and, yeah, it's actually quite

994
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
funny.

995
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,280
They feature it in the smaller 20GB size or the larger 60GB size.

996
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,080
Is it $599 US dollars?

997
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,560
Is it made from giant enemy crabs?

998
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
No.

999
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,280
All these jokes will never get old.

1000
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:43,080
It's actually, it's being sold at Sagatsu Isagi and it's being retailed for 3.99 yen

1001
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:48,760
marked down from 4.99 yen and 5.99 yen for the larger one.

1002
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,080
And it's kind of funny, though, because it has a picture of Ken Kataragi on the front

1003
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,080
there.

1004
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,080
Eating crabs?

1005
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,080
And it also has a picture of...

1006
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,480
The PlayStation 3 with the top lifted up with the grill on it.

1007
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,200
To be honest, I think that would be pretty cool if there was a grill on it because then

1008
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:10,160
you could eat and watch a Blu-ray movie at the same time.

1009
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:18,680
If anyone doesn't know, Akihabara is the technical district, I guess, where you can buy all of

1010
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,000
your techie goods and now barbecue sauce.

1011
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,400
I really want to buy barbecue sauce when I go buy a stereo.

1012
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,840
DJ Jenai says, 6-axis equals most innovative controller ever.

1013
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,240
PS3 is the best.

1014
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,960
Glad to know we have some Sony fans in chat because sometimes it feels like there are

1015
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:43,040
no Sony fans left in the world, so I'm glad to see somebody is still standing behind them.

1016
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,520
Anyhow, certainly these guys are fans of Sony.

1017
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:52,320
They just express their fanboyism in a different way because it's, let's see, who did this?

1018
00:55:52,320 --> 00:56:00,520
On the first day that firmware 3.10 came out, it got cracked.

1019
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,520
That's kind of funny.

1020
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,740
This was cracked by team C plus D and basically what happened is that of course they released

1021
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,720
the new firmware just a few days ago and it got cracked right in the same day by this

1022
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,240
team who works hard to crack the games, I'm sorry, to crack the firmware so that you can

1023
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,600
still continue to play your old school Nintendo games on your PS3.

1024
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:29,520
And they've already come out with custom firmware for 3.1, so great, now you can actually install

1025
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,360
the custom firmware, play all your updated games, and still be able to play your wonderful

1026
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,120
NES ROMs.

1027
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:42,760
DJ Jenai says, continuous is Sony fanboyism, saying, come on, Sony does what Nintendon't,

1028
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:48,800
the Rob D counters with, everyone stands behind Sony, to laugh at them behind their back.

1029
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:54,440
Rama says, I'll wait for the PS3 to be redesigned in retail for $149, give it six more months.

1030
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,440
Ouch.

1031
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,360
All right, any more PlayStation stories?

1032
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,280
I suppose I have some information.

1033
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,280
Okay.

1034
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,280
Some.

1035
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:13,120
Well, there's a little game that spawned a very interesting little music video called

1036
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,120
Saints Row.

1037
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:22,360
It's been confirmed that it will be going on to PS3, it's saying that sometime this

1038
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:30,280
spring it will have PlayStation Network support, and so that means multiplayer online.

1039
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,800
There was a mention, however, if they're going to have any additional content.

1040
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:43,240
Speaking of Saints Row, and that game had some CD parts in it, well, if you happen to

1041
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:49,560
be in some of the CD parts of Japan, you too can play the PlayStation 3 in one of Japan's

1042
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:55,000
love hotels, and yes, that is one of those brothel hotels.

1043
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:05,880
Casa Di Du in Shibuya, Tokyo, they have, with, I guess, your stay at these love hotels, you

1044
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,620
can be able to play PlayStation 3 for free.

1045
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:15,440
So I guess that's great, but at the same time, you know, I would be thinking, if you're staying

1046
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,480
at a love hotel, wouldn't you be going there for sex and not to play the PlayStation 3?

1047
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,920
Or is Sony trying to tell me the PlayStation 3 is better than sex?

1048
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,520
Or is it one of those things where it's like, okay, I'm going here, and not only will I

1049
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,700
get a hot chick to sleep with me, or borderline hot chick to sleep with me, but she'll play

1050
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,700
games with me?

1051
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,240
Well, love hotels aren't really just that.

1052
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,280
They're also where people meet for rendezvous with their significant other.

1053
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:49,760
And then all she would have to do is bake me a pie, and it's like the full thing.

1054
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,280
I just wanted to get the death glare from Jamie.

1055
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,880
I thought that was interesting, though.

1056
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:00,280
I mean, I guess that's pretty cool, because after you've done it, then you can play video

1057
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,280
games.

1058
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,320
And it's just like you never left home.

1059
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,960
Going back to a previous story in chat, reading some comments here, Mike W. says, it was decrypted

1060
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,400
day one, talking about the firmware.

1061
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
Then it was cracked.

1062
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Fault story, whatever.

1063
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,440
I don't care if OLR gets it wrong.

1064
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:23,840
Regardless, having the firmware get fucked with on day one, and having some form of security,

1065
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:28,600
to obsess with it, whether it be decryption or whatever it is, has got to say something.

1066
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,120
And it didn't take much longer after that, anyway.

1067
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,600
Ramas Bolden says, PlayStation 3 equals Sony's final console.

1068
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,920
The Rob D says, what would you listen to in a love hotel while playing video games?

1069
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,840
I want you to watch me play Madden Skip from Mad TV.

1070
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:50,280
I don't know if you've ever seen that, but it's kind of funny.

1071
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,960
Ravens Dolphin says, Loki is going there with Nelly to a love hotel.

1072
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,720
No, I wouldn't be going there.

1073
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,720
Why would I travel all the way to Japan to go to a love hotel?

1074
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,720
That's ridiculous.

1075
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,720
All right.

1076
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:10,640
Well, speaking of good lovin', there's this interesting thing here in Utah.

1077
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,960
They have that games as porn bill that keeps trying to pass over and over again.

1078
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:22,480
Well, unfortunately, the State House Committee of Utah voted to hold the legislation for

1079
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,840
the third time the other day, and the reason is freedom of speech.

1080
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,400
So of course, what they were trying to do is try to change it to say that Utah was going

1081
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,080
to be basically had to be sold as like pornography does.

1082
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:40,640
Let's see, Republican Kay McCliff had this to say, I am concerned when all the legal

1083
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,020
experts including our own Attorney General as well as the sponsor tell us that the bill

1084
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,160
is likely to fail in a constitutional challenge, one where we cannot control the amount we

1085
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,840
spend because we spend our side and then we are potentially obliged to spend the legal

1086
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,760
costs of the other side.

1087
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,360
Kay is trying to draft a substitute bill to replace the original.

1088
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,360
Leave it to a Republican.

1089
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:04,000
Well, you know, I don't want to turn this into a political war, but it's just general

1090
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,600
ignorance, I think, about the gaming community from everyone, and I think a lot of folks

1091
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,140
could stand to be educated no matter who you are or how you vote.

1092
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,140
I think a lot of-

1093
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,140
But mostly Republicans.

1094
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,600
I think a lot of people just don't get it.

1095
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,280
I'm just giving y'all a hard time.

1096
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,280
All right.

1097
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,840
Well, but there is- I have some- I do have some news about someone who has his head up

1098
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:29,120
his ass that makes me happy, speaking of, you know, Republicans.

1099
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,680
Sorry, I won't go off on Republicans anymore.

1100
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:39,840
There- Okay, sorry, there was some debate going on.

1101
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,840
Can we start over, please?

1102
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,840
Yes.

1103
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,840
Okay, thank you.

1104
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:51,680
Um, speaking of someone who has, uh, his head up his ass, um, he who shall not be named

1105
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:57,800
except right now, Jack Thompson, um, has been, um, called on yet another complaint with the

1106
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,800
Florida Bar.

1107
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,240
Um, it's- Oh my God.

1108
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:09,400
Anyway, there's a pending judicial review, um, for five counts of professional misconduct

1109
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,600
against, uh, dumbass.

1110
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,920
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be, you know, impersonal, right, um, against, uh, he who shall not be

1111
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:22,320
named to be, um, actually he's supposed to be going to the, uh, State Supreme Court,

1112
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,440
uh, for, uh, action.

1113
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,440
That's pretty cool.

1114
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,040
But the, uh, quote on here, um, says, uh, in the suit, uh, he who shall not be named

1115
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,800
represented the families of two Fayette, Alabama police officers and a police dispatcher murdered

1116
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,120
by an 18-year-old grand theft auto player in 2003.

1117
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,300
At the time of his arrest for the killings, Devin Moore reportedly said, life is like

1118
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,920
a video game, you have to die sometime.

1119
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,200
More subsequently convicted of the murders now sits on Alabama's death row.

1120
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,760
He who shall not be named was not involved in the criminal case against Moore.

1121
01:02:52,760 --> 01:03:00,400
Um, yeah, honestly, the other, the other, um, two complaints actually have to do with,

1122
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:08,520
um, the attacks he made, um, on shock radio in South Florida and, um, you know, I'm just

1123
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,520
so disgusted.

1124
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,760
Really, I, I hope that, I hope that he is disbarred.

1125
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,800
I hope this is the end of it.

1126
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,160
And we never- That would be awesome if we never had to report

1127
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,160
on him again.

1128
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,080
That would be the best thing ever.

1129
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,080
I'd hold a party.

1130
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,000
Uh, Rama and Shay, I think, I think we would- You know what?

1131
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,280
If this happens, we should throw a party.

1132
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,560
We absolutely should throw a party.

1133
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:36,200
We have a special party edition of Orange Lounge Radio, um, celebrating the vanquishment

1134
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,520
of he who shall not be named.

1135
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
We'll get guests and everything.

1136
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,560
I bet you anything, because, you know, gamer Andy was a big part of that flower and he

1137
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,560
doesn't live that far away.

1138
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,560
I bet you we could get him here to join our party.

1139
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:49,280
We'll get, we'll invite some, we'll get, we'll hold a big, massive frickin' party if this

1140
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,280
happens.

1141
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,280
We'll play World Combat Armageddon.

1142
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,280
Yes.

1143
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,280
Custom characters.

1144
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,520
We'll play nothing but video games where we put Jack Tonsom in them, Tonsom in them.

1145
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,880
What about the, uh, the Combine game?

1146
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,280
Sure, we'll play that too.

1147
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,280
Why not?

1148
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,280
We'll play that too.

1149
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,880
And, and, and, and, and- That'll piss him off.

1150
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,320
And our Music of Choice's Two Life crew and Ice-T.

1151
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,320
Bring it on!

1152
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,320
I love this idea!

1153
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,320
You know what?

1154
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,320
I think we should have this party anyway!

1155
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,120
No, but we're, okay, the party only happens if he gets disbarred.

1156
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,120
Okay?

1157
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,280
Is that, is that the criteria?

1158
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,840
If he gets disbarred- If he gets disbarred-

1159
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:24,740
In the state of Florida, OLR, he lost his licensed party.

1160
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:27,000
He who shall not be named is vanquished.

1161
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,880
However, if he is not disbarred, we send him a bag of poo in the mail.

1162
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,880
No, no, no.

1163
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,880
We're not children.

1164
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,880
Come on.

1165
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:41,960
Maybe we could call this bar is open party.

1166
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,520
Going to the chatroom, Rama says, isn't he who shall not be named Voldemort?

1167
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,600
So should we start- So do you, do you see the metaphor here?

1168
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,720
Should we start calling him Jack- Should that be his new nickname, Jack Voldemort?

1169
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,560
Jack Voldemort.

1170
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,080
I love that idea.

1171
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,680
He is just he who shall not be named.

1172
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,320
From here on out, we are calling him Jack Voldemort.

1173
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,320
I love that idea.

1174
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,840
And by the way, the reason why I brought up Two Life Crew and Ice-T is that he was also

1175
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:13,040
instrumental in the whole, you know, the cop killer scandal for Ice-T and for Two Life

1176
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,640
Crew's as nasty as they want to be.

1177
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,640
Wasn't that what it was called?

1178
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,760
And we'll also listen to Howard Stern because- Yes, we should copy it and send it to Howard

1179
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,760
Stern.

1180
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,440
Oh, I love this idea.

1181
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,440
Here's hoping.

1182
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,320
Would this all happen like next week if it happens?

1183
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,320
I missed the dates in there.

1184
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,320
I hope it happens.

1185
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,920
I don't think the dates were listed.

1186
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,460
Everything in the legal thing is a slow process.

1187
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:36,460
We'll see.

1188
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,960
I'll have to check my legal sites.

1189
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,960
All right.

1190
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,120
Anyway, any time, you know, it's become tradition on this program.

1191
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:48,440
Any time a story about Jack Voldemort comes up, you know what's going to happen next.

1192
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:52,600
That's right.

1193
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:58,680
It's our chance to rant about whatever we want.

1194
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,240
It's the FUs of the week.

1195
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,800
Get it out of your system, Darkstalker.

1196
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,280
I have two.

1197
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,000
The first one, FU to my uterus.

1198
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:14,520
Next one is an FU to Roseville, Mitsubishi, you bastards.

1199
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,520
Okay.

1200
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,520
This is what happens.

1201
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:28,200
My husband has a 2006 Lancer- Oh god, what Lancer does he have?

1202
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
A rally art, sorry.

1203
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,000
So it's like a model under the evolution.

1204
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,920
It's a nice, nice car.

1205
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:40,240
And he uses it to go to work, and he uses it, you know, sometimes for a couple of Bay

1206
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,240
Area trips.

1207
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,120
He doesn't drive it really crazily.

1208
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:49,800
I drive more violently than he does, and my car is still in good shape.

1209
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,600
Well, the transmission blew.

1210
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,880
And he had, you know, a car with only 15,000 miles on it, he's only had it for a year.

1211
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,720
There's no reason for a transmission to go out that quickly.

1212
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,200
So he took it to Roseville, Mitsubishi.

1213
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:10,280
And Bob Coffee, what I was saying is that it's the step under the Evo.

1214
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,280
Listen to what I said.

1215
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,680
Hi.

1216
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,360
And the FU to my uterus is for PMS.

1217
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:20,680
But anyway, back to the car.

1218
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:32,040
When he took it in, this was, the car first of all has the 10 year warranty on it, bumper

1219
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,920
to bumper warranty.

1220
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,760
So he took the car in, and they said, well, you know, we have to strip it down to look

1221
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,080
at the transmission, and if it's your fault, you pay $1100 to fix it.

1222
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,640
Well, first of all, if you don't drive your car like shit, then there's no reason for

1223
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,920
the transmission to go out.

1224
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:58,000
So he said, to hell with that, and said, you're not going to charge me for taking it apart,

1225
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,760
you're going to do the diagnostic on it.

1226
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,160
Like fine, then the warranty won't cover it.

1227
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:10,120
So he gets on the line with the, I guess the Mitsubishi corporate, they have a big stink

1228
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,120
over it.

1229
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:19,000
He said the customer service girl was friendly, but said that the caseworker was all like,

1230
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,320
hey look, we're going to have them break down the car for free, it's our dime, which they

1231
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,960
should have done in the first place, hi!

1232
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:34,680
And then they said if they determine the transmission thing is his fault, then they'll put it back

1233
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:39,760
together for free, and let him take it wherever he feels that he needs to to pay less for

1234
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,760
it.

1235
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:51,120
So, if I start talking about how much I love my new WRX STI, you'll find out what happened.

1236
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,280
We had some, I'm reading comments from chat, we had someone named the uterus join chat,

1237
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,080
that says don't let your uterus drive your car.

1238
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,640
And Rama says fucking cunt, and I'm going to say don't talk to Jamie like that, that's

1239
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,640
rude.

1240
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,640
Can I talk to, no, no, no.

1241
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,520
I know, he was saying someone else.

1242
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,480
Let's see, and then also, but Rama did say this, which I thought was really funny.

1243
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:16,000
He said, so if Jack equals Voldemort, that means that Jamie equals Hermione, Sky equals

1244
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,720
Harry, and Loki equals Ron.

1245
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:24,520
Dude, that means that I get Victor Crumb, and then the movie gets kind of hot.

1246
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,160
What do I get, Cho Chang?

1247
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:30,280
Hippity doo da, alright, anyway, was that it?

1248
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,280
Are you and your uterus done?

1249
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:36,160
Except she was really cool with this being, having that thick Scottish accent, I totally

1250
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,160
did it, it's perfect.

1251
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,960
Are you and your uterus finished?

1252
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,280
I wish that men had cramps.

1253
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,600
We do get cramps in a different story.

1254
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:51,840
I wish that men had hormone related cramps.

1255
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:55,240
I would love it.

1256
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,560
Maybe someday you can have balls.

1257
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,960
You'd all be big babies.

1258
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,600
And so I can kick you in them.

1259
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,840
Alright, uh, Loki, well I wish we could drive better, but we don't always get what we want,

1260
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,840
do we now?

1261
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,840
You know what?

1262
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,840
Fuck you.

1263
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,200
We did figure out why, we did figure out though why women drive bad, it's because estrogen

1264
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:17,200
causes you to have, you know, I don't know, some sort of balance problems, or like, you

1265
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,840
know, the world spins or something, I don't know, we're just going to use that as an excuse

1266
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,840
for now.

1267
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,840
I drive really well.

1268
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,120
There's going to be a fight in the parking lot after the show.

1269
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,120
I drive rough.

1270
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,120
What?

1271
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,440
I drive really well.

1272
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:34,120
You drive like a bat out of hell, I mean, you do get us from point A to point B the

1273
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,120
quickest way possible.

1274
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,120
I'll give you that.

1275
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:42,200
But, I don't cut people off, I don't talk on my phone while I drive, I'm like somebody

1276
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,200
in this room.

1277
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,560
You cast hexes on people when you drive.

1278
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,720
And they get out of my way.

1279
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,720
Loki, finish.

1280
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:57,080
Um, I don't even remember what my FU of the week was to, uh, so yeah, I'm just going to

1281
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:01,640
say bad to women drivers because there's been a lot of them, especially driving slow or

1282
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,440
that, you know, they can't seem to, you know, navigate that minivan, you know, it's like

1283
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,440
if you can't fucking drive a car, just stay at home.

1284
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:15,280
Just fuck everybody who drives a minivan that doesn't need one of those.

1285
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:20,720
And I swear to god I fucking hate people that drive, you know, SUVs, off-road vehicles,

1286
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:25,800
mind you, that have to go over the fucking speed bumps like it's, like their car's made

1287
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,800
of glass.

1288
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,280
It's a fucking off-road car, it should be able to handle this damn little speed bump.

1289
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,880
I know my car could go over that super fast.

1290
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,880
Why can't yours?

1291
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,240
Oh my god, I'm having to loop the music, we're going to six minutes here.

1292
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,120
Actually, I have one, I have one more thing.

1293
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,120
Oh goody.

1294
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,120
I have one more.

1295
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,120
Alright.

1296
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,000
FU to people who think that just because you're married you need to start breeding.

1297
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Moooo.

1298
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Moooo.

1299
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,840
First of all, children do not save a marriage.

1300
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,400
It makes it worse.

1301
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,280
Secondly, if you can't afford...

1302
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,680
This is episode part FU, because that's all this segment's going to be.

1303
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,720
Secondly, if you cannot afford the child, don't have one.

1304
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:13,440
Thirdly, if I say I don't want children, fucking respect what I have to say.

1305
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,920
Don't keep pushing it until I go puke in the bathroom at Cattleman's.

1306
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,560
Thank you.

1307
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,560
Can I do my FUs now?

1308
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,560
No.

1309
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,560
Do I get to do my FUs?

1310
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,560
Okay, fine.

1311
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,560
Alright.

1312
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,880
So my FU of the week also goes to Jamie's uterus, and then I would like to say an FU.

1313
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,880
Just kidding.

1314
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,880
Heart.

1315
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:32,880
I don't think she heard me.

1316
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,880
My uterus, my choice.

1317
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,360
I would also like to give an FU, and it's my choice to say FU.

1318
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,360
Just kidding.

1319
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,360
Heart.

1320
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,360
Love you.

1321
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:45,200
No, seriously though, I want to say FU to dentistry, because oh my god, my dental bills.

1322
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,720
And it's not like my teeth are that awful.

1323
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,360
I don't think I have, like I've not got some crazy thing going on, like a gap or anything.

1324
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,680
It's just like, oh my god, I have so much money, and I can't afford her dental stuff,

1325
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,400
so it sucks.

1326
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,320
And then I got like a temporary crown way in the back where you can't even see it, and

1327
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,840
it fell out two days after I got it.

1328
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,840
I mean, come on.

1329
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,760
I just feel like every time, I feel like going to the dentist is like going to used car salesmen

1330
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,760
sometimes.

1331
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,760
There's so much pressure.

1332
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,760
No wonder people are afraid of the dentist.

1333
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,760
I'm not afraid of the dentist.

1334
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,760
I just fall asleep.

1335
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,080
It's not just, it's not the drill work I'm afraid of.

1336
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,560
I'm afraid of the way they treat people.

1337
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,560
Anyway.

1338
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,560
You should go to my dentist.

1339
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,560
She's really cool.

1340
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,560
I don't think my insurance will let me.

1341
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,560
That's a whole other FU.

1342
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,560
FU to your testicles, by the way.

1343
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,560
Thank you.

1344
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,560
Oh, sure, sure, anytime.

1345
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,560
FU, Jamie.

1346
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,640
Thank god, this is radio.

1347
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:36,880
Your testicles sound like Grover.

1348
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:42,280
Well they're blue.

1349
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,080
Welcome to octaves of Jamie that you normally don't listen.

1350
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,880
I don't know if it's picking up because she doesn't have the mic near her, but she's going

1351
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:58,040
to listen about three octaves higher than we usually hear.

1352
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:12,600
On this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, giggling schoolgirls, near, far, near, far.

1353
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,240
Thank god this is radio.

1354
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:21,800
Speaking of near and far, one game that's near dear to my heart, Grand Theft Auto, is

1355
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:28,080
doing really well far away in Japan, where Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has taken number

1356
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,760
one in their sales charts.

1357
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,760
That is right.

1358
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,280
Beating out such DS titles as those brain training things.

1359
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,280
Fuck brain training.

1360
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,480
It's all about killing hookers.

1361
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:42,600
That's really what Japan needs, and god damn it, they just got their dose of killing hookers.

1362
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,320
So way to go Japan.

1363
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,680
You just need to get on the bandwagon now with Grand Theft Auto IV, then I could be

1364
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:53,160
killing more hookers from Japan.

1365
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,640
Kevin DDR says, what, GTA can't do well in Japan?

1366
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,000
It's doing well now.

1367
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
It's number one.

1368
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,840
But I mean, should that be such a big deal?

1369
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,840
I mean, it's number one here.

1370
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,680
Was it not allowed to do well in there?

1371
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,560
Usually US games don't do very well in Japan.

1372
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:14,080
So I would think, you know, that, you know.

1373
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,320
Rob says, sounds like the OLR crew just got ahold of the wacky weed.

1374
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,320
No, we don't.

1375
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,160
I don't know about the other two, but I don't really do that.

1376
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:23,840
Drinking's fine, but we're not drunk either tonight, and only when drinking responsibly.

1377
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,840
So.

1378
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,840
Rob.

1379
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,840
Winners don't use drugs.

1380
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,840
Remember the FBI warning.

1381
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,840
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1382
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,840
What?

1383
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,840
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1384
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,840
What?

1385
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:32,840
Never do that again.

1386
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,740
It was funny and you know it.

1387
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,920
Never do that.

1388
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:45,520
Speaking of blue things, Sonic the Hedgehog is, had a funny little misprint on Amazon

1389
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,480
and a little screen shot made its way to Kotaku this week and they labeled the story Sonic

1390
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:55,160
the Vacuum Cleaner because they put a little picture of Sonic the Hedgehog under Dirt Devil

1391
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,520
Upright Vacuum.

1392
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:01,000
Obviously this is some type of database mistake, but it makes people LOL nonetheless because

1393
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,480
it's kind of funny to see things wrong like that.

1394
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:11,120
Like remember when they were selling the Wii for like $1,119 or whatever was the release

1395
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,120
date?

1396
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,120
Somebody screwed up the database?

1397
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,120
Something similar happened here.

1398
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,000
Maybe they just found out that Sonic the Hedgehog sucked?

1399
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Haha!

1400
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,280
I see what you did there because I hadn't heard that joke a million times already on

1401
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,280
Kotaku.

1402
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,540
Speaking of games that suck, Unexpected.

1403
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,400
This is like totally rad.

1404
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:40,080
The Burger King had, they reported higher than anticipated quarterly earnings because

1405
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:44,140
of the Xbox 360 promo games, at least that's what they figured.

1406
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:51,600
The games actually pulled sales up to $38 million in the US alone.

1407
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:58,240
And so, how can these games have gone double platinum?

1408
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,560
I guess with the fact that they were $4 a piece.

1409
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:06,080
Because there are 2 million achievement point whores in the world who just needed the extra

1410
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,160
600 points that these games would give is actually what happened.

1411
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,160
I guess.

1412
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,160
They are also now $0.99 each.

1413
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,360
I heard about that, that's crazy.

1414
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,000
So if you haven't bought them yet.

1415
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,680
There are two that I still need, I only have Sneak King.

1416
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:24,920
Yeah, if you haven't bought it yet, might as well do it, because $0.99, that's not bad

1417
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:25,920
for a game.

1418
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:26,920
Even if it does suck.

1419
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,960
You can collect collector's things before too long.

1420
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,560
It will be as rare as Rondo of Blood, okay maybe not.

1421
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,960
But nowhere near as awesome.

1422
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,680
Let's hear what games are coming out very soon that could soon become collector's items.

1423
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,720
Do you have any exclusives for us this week, Loki, on release dates?

1424
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:50,520
No, because I took time off work and there wasn't really much to mention anyway.

1425
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:54,520
We mentioned everything probably last week and anything exclusive would have been at

1426
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,560
Konami's Gamer Day and all that fun stuff.

1427
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,640
What was I going to say though?

1428
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,240
But this week though, there's some good stuff coming out.

1429
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,600
If you are a fan of Winning Eleven, you'll be happy to know that that is finally making

1430
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:13,240
its way out now on PlayStation 2, on the 360, DS, and PSP.

1431
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,560
So that's pretty awesome.

1432
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:21,520
Also there's going to be, actually there's not a lot of PlayStation 2 games coming out

1433
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,760
this week, I know that for a fact.

1434
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,500
I do believe the Final Fantasy VI comes out on the Game Boy Advance this week, which is

1435
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,060
pretty awesome.

1436
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:37,160
So definitely check that out, because I know, what is it, Five did really well, everybody's

1437
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,640
picking up Five.

1438
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:45,360
There should be some more Wii's and DS Lite's coming to, I want to say to all the retailers

1439
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,600
this week as well, because I know they've been out of stock for a long time.

1440
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:55,440
They were actually sold out on Nintendo for the last two weeks.

1441
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:02,460
Other than that stuff, wow, it was just a whole lot of crap coming out this week.

1442
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:06,320
So I want to say that's probably what I'd really, oh, how could I forget this, Diddycom

1443
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,320
Racing DS, that's coming out.

1444
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,320
So if you know.

1445
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,320
I've been seeing commercials for that.

1446
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:15,400
If you want to get your fix on a Mario Kart type racing game, and this is kind of cool,

1447
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,400
they've got a create your own track mode, you basically draw a track with the stylus,

1448
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:25,520
so that's kind of neat, R. Tonleko on Playstation 2, another Atlus RPG, so definitely worth

1449
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,520
checking out.

1450
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:32,200
If you're into puzzle games, Capcom Puzzle World on the PSP, so that was pretty fun,

1451
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,280
because it has Puzzle Fighter on it.

1452
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:39,800
Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI on Playstation 2, if you're a fan of that.

1453
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:44,560
And then MVP07 NCAA Baseball if you're into college baseball on Playstation 2.

1454
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,480
I just want to say release date wise, because I don't know if you explicitly stated this

1455
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:52,000
on an earlier show, but we did confirm that DDR Universe is February 27th.

1456
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,800
So almost March, but not quite.

1457
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,520
And I'd also like to mention Lunar Nights on the DS is coming out this week.

1458
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,520
Oh, very cool.

1459
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,320
Good, that was a neat title, I might have to pick that up.

1460
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,800
Coming out in Japan, we like to cover Japanese release dates too, because sometimes it's

1461
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,680
kind of interesting to see what they get a lot later, and also what they get over there

1462
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,240
now we may be getting over here pretty soon, and I wonder if this might be one of them

1463
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:18,960
on the Xbox 360, they're getting a badly needed role playing game this week, because

1464
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,720
you know Xbox kind of gets a lot of slack for not having a lot of choice when it comes

1465
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,720
to role playing games.

1466
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:26,160
I mean sure you have Phantasy Star, which is kind of borderline, and then you have Enchanted

1467
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:31,780
Arms, but they're getting a new game this week from Type, or I'm sorry from Idea Factory,

1468
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:37,340
it's called Diario Rebirth Moon Legend, it's a new RPG coming out on the Xbox 360, coming

1469
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,160
out in Japan on the 8th.

1470
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:44,880
It's coming out in Japan this week on the 8th, Fusion Frenzy 2 on the Xbox 360, coming

1471
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:50,040
out on the Playstation 3, Virtua Fighter 5 makes it's way this week on February 8th,

1472
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,720
that should be pretty cool, it's also coming out with a little stick, a Virtua stick is

1473
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,160
coming out just for that game.

1474
01:20:56,160 --> 01:21:06,620
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, guess what Jamie, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai, that's

1475
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:12,360
the subtitle for Cooking Mama on the Wii, coming out this week by Taito over there in Japan,

1476
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:19,040
oh she's over here to correct me, my horrible pronunciations, Minatoishio ni Orioi Taikai,

1477
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,040
I'm getting better, Taikai, give me that, I'm getting better, you're getting better,

1478
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:30,520
alright and coming out on the Playstation 2, Outrun 2 is coming out, Stella Deuce, and

1479
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:38,640
one of my favorite title names for this week coming from Capcom, Full House Kiss 2 is coming

1480
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:45,960
out on the Playstation 2, and the cover for Full House Kiss 2, it's four guys all surrounding

1481
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:55,320
a chick holding a bouquet, so you know what that means, they're all going to go banger.

1482
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:01,320
Coming out on other systems, the Nintendo DS has Jet Impulse and Luminous Arc and Morita

1483
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:06,320
Shogi on the DS, all coming out this week, and lastly do we have anything on the PSP,

1484
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:13,120
we do, New Rainbow Island, Herdy Gurdy Daibuken is coming out this week, that should be tons

1485
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:19,100
of fun I'm sure, I know, but it's kind of like, Bubble Bobble in general, like I remember

1486
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,720
like the retro Bubble Bobble stuff used to be cool, but ever since that whole no boss

1487
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,360
on level 30 thing I just, Rainbow Island, I'm burned down on that shit, Rondo of Blood,

1488
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,360
alright anyway.

1489
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:35,320
Okay, well, for our friends in the UK, there are some games coming out, which is a good

1490
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:41,840
thing because games coming out, you know, is fun, we have coming out February 6th, War

1491
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:50,120
Rock on PC, on the 8th, Sam & Max Episode 3, the Mole, the Mob, and the Meatball on PC,

1492
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:57,160
on the 9th though, just a crap ton of games, Avatar the Last Airbender on damn near everything,

1493
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:04,320
Battle Stations Midway, Battle Zone, Blade Dancer, Lineage of Light, Bomberman, Charlotte's

1494
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:12,400
Web on a few things, Deep Labyrinth, Maelstrom, Magical Starsign, Metal Slug Anthology, Naruto,

1495
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:19,560
Ultimate Ninja, Okami, scrolling down because I'm running out of room, Saint Seiya the Hades,

1496
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:25,080
Space Empires V, The Professor's Brain Trainer, Logic, and Memory, The Sims Life Stories,

1497
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:30,240
Thrillville, Totally Spies 2, Undercover, and that's it so far.

1498
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:33,000
Did you say they're getting Okami this week?

1499
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,160
Yeah, PlayStation 2.

1500
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:38,600
Now since way too many people overlooked that game over here, I'm leaving it up to you folks

1501
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,040
over in the UK to show Okami a little love so we make sure we get a sequel out of that

1502
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,040
game.

1503
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,040
Sound fair?

1504
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,040
I didn't know there was a Saint Seiya game.

1505
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,880
I don't think you're going to get a sequel since Clover Studios is gone.

1506
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:52,800
Oh fuck, that's right, huh?

1507
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,920
Lots of Metal Slug, everybody.

1508
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:55,920
Lots of Metal Slug.

1509
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,800
Okami's sequel is now sitting with my Guardian Legends sequel somewhere.

1510
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,000
Cry.

1511
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,240
Sob.

1512
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,360
Leap.

1513
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,520
QQ.

1514
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:11,360
Anyways, one movie that doesn't really need to be made is definitely going to be spawned

1515
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,960
from a game with lots of sequels, DOA the movie.

1516
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,160
Apparently it was going to be a theatrical movie but then apparently they realized, hey,

1517
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,160
you know what?

1518
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:20,160
The movie really sucks.

1519
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:25,000
So let's just release it straight to DVD, which means that someone dumped it to the

1520
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
internet.

1521
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,520
Doesn't the movie have Ally Larter in it?

1522
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,520
Who is...

1523
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,520
Devin Alki in it.

1524
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,520
Yeah.

1525
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,680
Ally Larter is the one chick on Heroes that nobody likes her storyline and everybody who

1526
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,320
TiVo's it fast-forward her scenes.

1527
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:40,120
Is she the one who plays the split personality?

1528
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,120
Yes.

1529
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,520
I haven't even watched any and I know who that is.

1530
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,440
I think she's in the movie, right?

1531
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,920
The only thing I saw was a scene of her in that place.

1532
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,800
I, you know, I...

1533
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,800
Spoilers!

1534
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,800
I told Rob.

1535
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,800
I know.

1536
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:58,160
It is available on Google Video and to be honest, if you really want to watch the whole

1537
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:02,600
thing I guess it's better than spending the money to rent it or buy it.

1538
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:09,580
But really, I just hear it's just yet another really bad movie.

1539
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:11,080
It won't play.

1540
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,720
Well, I think they had originally it linked on.

1541
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,520
Don't they keep taking it down and stuff?

1542
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:19,120
It keeps getting taken down, but it is.

1543
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:24,080
It does come back up and if you read the Kotaku story which links to the structural story.

1544
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,380
It's like that Natalie Portman video when she rapped on SNL.

1545
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:32,000
They just kept taking it off of YouTube and it kept coming right back.

1546
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,900
But here's what you can do if you really want to, you know, watch it and keep it or whatever.

1547
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:41,060
You can always download the PSP or iPod versions and you can download those straight to your

1548
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:42,060
PC.

1549
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:46,520
If you don't want to stream it later on.

1550
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,080
Brad from Pod Culture which is another indie podcast is in our chat room right now and

1551
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,560
says, LOL we just reviewed that on our latest episode.

1552
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:59,340
So if you want to hear Brad's review of Dead or Alive the movie, check out podculture.blogspot.com.

1553
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:04,520
This whole movie could have been made a lot better and worth watching if it were rated

1554
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,640
NC-17 and there was more nudity.

1555
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:13,520
Because right now as it stands there is no nudity in it so that is the main problem to

1556
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,880
why this, because it doesn't matter if the movie sucked, as long as it had nudity it

1557
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:21,240
would have been great.

1558
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:24,000
Whoever is playing this rondo of blood is really bad.

1559
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,640
I mean how about the, you know, how about the...

1560
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:30,240
You know one of those sites taped me playing one of the game.

1561
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,880
I don't know who did it, but you know how like they do the...

1562
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,760
Did you keep getting picked up by the dragon?

1563
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,760
No.

1564
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:35,760
Then this isn't you.

1565
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,760
Oh good.

1566
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,880
Because you know like sometimes they hook up their equipment like as you're playing

1567
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,880
it and they're taken.

1568
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,880
Like that happened...

1569
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:45,400
I know some of the Rumble Roses XX clips out there were mean because like I was sucked

1570
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,440
so bad I was getting owned and like so there's some Rumble Roses XX clip out there and I'm

1571
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,360
playing the chick who's getting killed really bad.

1572
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,360
I'm sorry.

1573
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,600
I'm sorry if I keep going back to...

1574
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,880
I know, total tangent stuff.

1575
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:56,880
Anyway.

1576
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,840
We will beat the Dracula out of her during the break folks, so don't worry.

1577
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,160
Oh, oh, oh.

1578
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:09,080
There is a new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan this spring.

1579
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,360
Sega and Toei Studios are teaming up for a feature-length adaptation.

1580
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:22,240
It's Ryugo Goto-ku is the Yakuza name, part two is coming out.

1581
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:28,680
It's coming out from Miike and he had practiced before making cinematic versions of the game,

1582
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,560
so should be interesting.

1583
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:37,120
He's also made Audition, Chakushin Ari, and one of Loki's favorites, Ichi the Killer.

1584
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,320
Ichi the Killer is awesome.

1585
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:43,160
He should be very excited about this new Yakuza flick coming out in Japan because if they

1586
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,260
tear some guy's face off and throw it against a wall, I mean, I don't see how that could

1587
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,600
be bad like in Ichi the Killer.

1588
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,600
That was gross.

1589
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,880
I still will not watch that.

1590
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,260
You don't think they have a special edition of that out now, I think?

1591
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:55,720
It's pretty violent.

1592
01:27:55,720 --> 01:28:00,720
If they have a super violent version of the movie, I would totally watch that.

1593
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,000
I remember seeing it somewhere.

1594
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,400
Well, at any rate, you know, there's I'm sure people who are going to be a little violent

1595
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,780
over this bit of information.

1596
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:19,520
A major UK retailer, HMV, their online store, is taking pre-orders for PlayStation 3s, but

1597
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:27,480
you have to also purchase a 4GB PSP pack, so you'll be paying a total of £675.

1598
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:35,720
They're sending an email out that will say you become one of the lucky few who can pick

1599
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:38,080
up the PlayStation 3 at launch.

1600
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:44,240
The quote says, at HMV.co.uk, we've been working with Sony to offer up to 5,000 customers an

1601
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:48,200
incredible deal when you buy the new Sony 4GB PSP.

1602
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:52,760
Sony takes advantage of this offer, will get priority over other HMV.co.uk customers for

1603
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,240
the PlayStation 3.

1604
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:59,400
The deal also includes two PSP games, Kills and Liberation and Gangs of London, for the

1605
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:04,320
price of £674.99.

1606
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,240
Are they expecting the same mass hysteria over there in the UK that they had over here

1607
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:12,240
at first, which, you know, then after Christmas just kind of dropped off like a rock?

1608
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,640
I mean, is that, because that's the kind of shit we saw them doing over here when it came

1609
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:16,640
out.

1610
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:18,840
It's crazy, and then realize the Wii was better.

1611
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:23,640
Well, again, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, and, you know.

1612
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,640
So the Wii is better.

1613
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,840
Well, yeah, and the Wii had Zelda and all that.

1614
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,560
There's one good PlayStation 3 game out right now.

1615
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,560
One.

1616
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,400
I really hope more comes out.

1617
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:38,040
I mean, I, it's not that I want to see Sony fail, and it's not that I want to make fun

1618
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:43,440
of Sony, and I love my PlayStation 2, but, God damn, Sony.

1619
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,560
They're making it easy for us.

1620
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,040
I know, it's like, God, argh!

1621
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:52,360
We actually have not touched our PS3 in, I want to say, about two weeks now.

1622
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:56,800
And the only reason we actually put anything in it was to watch Talladega Nights, and that

1623
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,080
was Dan, and I left the room.

1624
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,320
I'm sorry I grew up in Alabama.

1625
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:07,120
Alpha Canagram says, I hadn't played Zelda in two to three weeks due to Virtual Console.

1626
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,520
You know, I forgot to say at the top of the show I've been playing Virtual Console, that's

1627
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,520
the other stuff I've been playing this week.

1628
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:13,280
Mario Kart 64, awesome.

1629
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,680
Still stuck on R-Type.

1630
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,840
I've been playing Zelda, Link to the Past, as well.

1631
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,840
R-Type.

1632
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,040
Zelda, Link to the Past, Super Contra 3.

1633
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:25,800
I can play that on my Nintendo.

1634
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:26,800
R-Type.

1635
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,760
My name's Jamie, and I have 50,000 consoles in my house.

1636
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:31,920
They're all collecting dust, too.

1637
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,240
We actually might sell some.

1638
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,240
Really?

1639
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,240
Yeah.

1640
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,240
I'll have to find money.

1641
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,440
I want a Virtual Boy, for no good reason.

1642
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,440
Do you have a Virtual Boy?

1643
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,440
You want to buy mine?

1644
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,440
Five dollars.

1645
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,440
Seriously?

1646
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,440
Five dollars right now.

1647
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,440
I don't know.

1648
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:48,080
I'm going to get five dollars right fucking now.

1649
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,040
I might have some change in my room.

1650
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,040
Alright, anyhow.

1651
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,040
I'll take it for six.

1652
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,040
Ten?

1653
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,040
Do I hear ten?

1654
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,040
Fuck you, bitch.

1655
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,040
I'll buy ten.

1656
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,040
I put down ten.

1657
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,040
Fifteen.

1658
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,040
Do we hear fifteen?

1659
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,040
Fuck that.

1660
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,040
It's not worth fifteen dollars.

1661
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,040
Yay!

1662
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,040
Ten dollars!

1663
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,040
Guess what?

1664
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,040
I lied.

1665
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,040
You're a bitch.

1666
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,040
Alright, anyway.

1667
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,040
You still love me.

1668
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,040
Maybe.

1669
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,640
While we all fight out how we're going to buy the console behind the scenes and play

1670
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:16,880
OLR Bay, while we do that, we're going to take a quick break.
