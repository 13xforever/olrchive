00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Loco King!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, February 11th, 2007, Xbox gamerscore whores might get rewarded soon,

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
an old PC gaming franchise is said to be coming back,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and we have some exclusive news on the Alice movie.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello, everybody out there on the Internet.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are that podcast on the Internet

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
dedicated to video gaming and gaming culture

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and what you, the gamer, really want to know.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I'm here to help you through that.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Joining me, as always, say hello to my lovely co-hosts

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
in that corner, the happiest bunny on the farm,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Roar.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Fresh off the highway.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Seriously.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How many small furry animals did you run over on your way here?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Absolutely zero.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's good to know.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How many SUV drivers did you run off the road on your way here?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Fifty.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
All right. Good to hear.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Good job.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Massa.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Loki.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How you doing, Loki?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Good.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Did you run anyone off the road on the way here?

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, only in game earlier.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
All right.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's good to hear.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
First off, I want to apologize for my sound tonight

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
because, A, I'm recovering from a cold,

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
so I sound a little bit congested.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I got the plague.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I guess in 2007 this will be the year of Rob getting the plague

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
instead of Jamie getting the plague all the time,

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so that's entertaining.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You'll have the plague if you develop bronchial pneumonia

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and lose 20 pounds in three weeks.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hopefully it's not that.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I tried to get an appointment with a doctor,

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
but they were like,

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The earliest the doctor can see you is Tuesday.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's what she sounded like, too.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The earliest the doctor can see you is Tuesday.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is on Friday.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm like, Tuesday.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, I hope to be better by Tuesday,

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
so I guess an appointment's not necessary.

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's like, ah, jerks.

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Urgent care.

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My co-pays hire for urgent care.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't want to deal with that.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Anyway, I'm doing better on my own

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
by taking over-the-counter drugs.

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Drugs are my friend.

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Over-the-counter, all legal.

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All right.

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Anyhow.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, that only suppresses your healing process.

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, whatever.

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Anyhow.

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, also, and then the microphone I used to use, dead.

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Dead as hell, run over by too many rolling chairs here in the office.

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's dead a million times over,

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so I have a new microphone that sounds like I'm talking out of a tin can,

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
even though this microphone probably costs twice as much

73
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
as Loki's microphone that he's using.

74
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Which the top is falling off of this microphone.

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, that's just lovely to hear.

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, then you'll have a tin can microphone soon, too.

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
My microphone's working just fine.

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I want that, but that was donated to us.

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I have no idea where that microphone came from.

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I know who it came from.

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I know where it came from.

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I mean, I know who donated it.

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We don't want to get them.

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Really?

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because we need two more like that.

86
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Guitar center.

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Really?

88
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And that's where we're going.

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We're going shopping.

90
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Any place that sells microphones.

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We're going shopping.

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No, dude, I got this at Radio Shack.

93
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I was like, oh, Radio Shack, you know, they have like ten different microphones.

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You need radio crap.

95
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, I mean, this microphone, I don't want to tell you how much it was,

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but I'll say it was twice as much as that one,

97
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and it has the tin can sound to it.

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, I don't know.

99
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think it'll just take some getting used to.

100
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Just put it up to your neck and go, hello.

101
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Next week in front of me is funny.

102
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, really?

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay.

104
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Being told secrets from Jamie.

105
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, maybe we will get a shopping spree next week.

106
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who knows?

107
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wait, are you saying I should do this, Loki?

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hello, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

109
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
All right.

110
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Anyway, I'm being rude and have not introduced our special guest yet.

111
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So, these are some buddies of Orange Lounge Radio.

112
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Say hello to Rice Princess.

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
She's been on the show before.

114
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes, I have.

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hello.

116
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How are you?

117
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She's the one that never like talks loud enough,

118
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
so you can never hear her in the microphone.

119
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sorry.

120
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So, Rice Princess, I want you to just yell at me tonight.

121
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Just yell.

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You fucking asshole!

123
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There you go.

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Great.

125
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hi.

126
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now we can hear you.

127
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
All right.

128
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And also say hello to Eddie.

129
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yep.

130
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's me.

131
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Have you ever been on this show before, Eddie?

132
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, like three or four years ago.

133
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Big, fruity, gay Eddie.

134
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Casper the Gay.

135
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's me.

136
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Casper the Gay.

137
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Eddie the Friendly Gay.

138
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What kind of games are you into since you've never been on the show before?

139
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Never been on the show before.

140
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You haven't been on here since we've been podcasting.

141
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
When you were on the show, we had like five people listening,

142
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and we thought we were the shit.

143
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Including us in the room.

144
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's exactly.

145
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It was like the live studio audience was it.

146
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We were live performers.

147
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But now we have this whole internet podcast, iPod thing.

148
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's crazy.

149
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
All right.

150
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So what type of games are you into?

151
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Fantasy adventure.

152
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

153
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm a diehard Nintendo fanboy, which everybody I guess is not as bad anymore,

154
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
because Wii's pretty cool.

155
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But yep.

156
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Fantasy adventure kind of games like Zelda.

157
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It was-

158
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
RPGs.

159
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Was Zelda like your favorite game that came out last year, you'd say?

160
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

161
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Twilight Princess by far.

162
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What would you say is your favorite video game of all time,

163
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
just so we have something to go off of here?

164
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Of all time?

165
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Probably like Link to the Past, something like that.

166
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So you're a total Link fanboy.

167
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Nerd.

168
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Nerd.

169
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Nerdy nerd.

170
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All right.

171
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, Casper the Gay, do you follow gaming news a lot?

172
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you follow the gaming culture?

173
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

174
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I log on to the IGN sometimes.

175
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Really?

176
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You shouldn't log on to those big money sites, though.

177
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, I know.

178
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The correct answer is,

179
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I read independent blogs like Destructoid and Kotaku.

180
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There you go.

181
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Whatever Rob said.

182
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And I'll go to Orange Lounge Radio for all my news,

183
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and Augames.com, they're the shit.

184
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There you go.

185
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Good job, Eddie.

186
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, good.

187
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's what it sounds like.

188
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right.

189
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Also, no.

190
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Actually, you know, as far as the big box...

191
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why is Eddie Mr. Bill?

192
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know.

193
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
As far as the big box sites go,

194
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
IGN doesn't bug me nearly as bad as some of the others.

195
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah.

196
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Anyway, let's see.

197
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm reading chat room,

198
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
because we also have the chat room is always here

199
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to lend their perspective as well.

200
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We love our chat room.

201
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's see.

202
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What do we have here?

203
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
J.P. Bond says,

204
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yay Rice Princess.

205
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Dark Knight says,

206
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What is up, our home girl?

207
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You didn't say it right, Rob.

208
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm doing very good.

209
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How about you?

210
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Good.

211
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's see.

212
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Act Deaf says,

213
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Isn't every gay person friendly?

214
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No.

215
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No.

216
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Absolutely not.

217
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've dated some real bitches in the past.

218
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, no, no.

219
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No, no.

220
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No, no, no, no.

221
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In fact, we could name some on this program,

222
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
but we're above that.

223
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not.

224
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
All I have to say...

225
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All of you.

226
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, I'm just kidding.

227
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you like to listen to the live shows on Orange Laundrio,

228
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
because, you know, we don't just do this podcast.

229
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We have live shows there as well.

230
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Wednesday happens to be guys on the show,

231
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and it's our Valentine's Day special.

232
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We're going to be calling some of our exes on air

233
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and wishing them a happy Valentine's Day,

234
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
so that'll be a good time.

235
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Anyway, let's see.

236
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
J.P. Bond says,

237
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I am gay, and I am far from friendly.

238
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know, I met J.P. Bond in person.

239
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He was just shy.

240
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, man, he's gay?

241
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

242
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I thought, like, he was a straight boy that had a crush on me,

243
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
because he was happy that I was on.

244
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was like, oh, yes, I'm going to get a boy...

245
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You should know this.

246
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Weren't we just talking the other day?

247
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I promise we'll get into video game news soon.

248
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Weren't we just saying the other day

249
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
when I was watching Lifetime movies,

250
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
because I was sick, and when I'm home sick,

251
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I watch Lifetime movies, and there was a...

252
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You happened to be over.

253
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I was watching one.

254
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There was a commercial for Gay, Straight, or Taken.

255
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes.

256
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And you were like,

257
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I was born to be on that show.

258
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Apparently, I'm not.

259
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm going to be, like, the worst person ever.

260
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm going to get it totally wrong.

261
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Have you heard of this show, Dark Soccer?

262
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Gay, Straight, or Taken on Lifetime?

263
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's...

264
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
TV?

265
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, I know.

266
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I know you don't watch Lifetime,

267
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
so that's why I'm sharing this with you.

268
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't even have cable, Rob.

269
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay.

270
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The extent of my cable is court TV.

271
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Are you familiar with Lifetime, vagina television?

272
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you familiar with Lifetime?

273
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

274
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Television, vagina...

275
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I haven't watched Lifetime in easily three years.

276
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Right.

277
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, Lifetime is, like, women's TV, and, like, you know, all the...

278
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's why I don't watch it.

279
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's stupid.

280
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The movies they have on there are, like, the best movies ever.

281
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They have, like, you know, Final Justice, the story of the woman who stood, you know,

282
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in, like, you know...

283
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Who stood in line at Walmart.

284
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,600
The story of the woman who was horribly raped and murdered and had, you know, a Lifetime

285
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
movie made out of her.

286
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
And had ear mites.

287
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Right.

288
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I frickin' love Lifetime movies.

289
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Or the most recent one...

290
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I should pick up a Lifetime movie.

291
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Was the Fantasia...

292
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
You should be a Lifetime movie.

293
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
No way.

294
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,920
Dark Sakura, the gamer girl of the millennia, I don't know.

295
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,360
The Fantasia Burino story was one I just recently watched.

296
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,240
But anyway, my point is, there's commercials for this show, this new show they're doing,

297
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,640
Gay, Straight, or Taken.

298
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a dating show, and the thing is that a woman goes out on a date with a gay man,

299
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,280
a straight man, and a guy who's already married or taken, has a girlfriend.

300
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,600
And at the end is when she finds it, like, she has to pick which one's which, and if

301
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,080
she correctly picks the straight man, then they win, like, a fabulous, you know, date

302
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,000
prize, like, Hawaii-type thing.

303
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,360
But if she picks one of the others, then they win a prize, and she gets nothing.

304
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,160
Yeah, because whiny straight girls have it so hard.

305
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
What?

306
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,560
So, is this something you would watch?

307
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
No.

308
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Hell no.

309
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,680
Should they make a...

310
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,320
Is this a video game that would appeal to gamer girls?

311
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Is this...

312
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,280
Because, you know, there's always that thing going around, like, how do we get women into

313
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
gaming?

314
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
How...

315
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Because I've got two women in here.

316
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
I know how to make...

317
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
How do we get women into gaming?

318
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,540
Do we need Lifetime to bring out, like, you know, the video voyeur, the Susan Wilson video

319
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,540
game?

320
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,540
Is that...

321
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,540
Is that what we need?

322
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
I'm having a terrible hair day.

323
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,200
Oh, my God, that movie was so bad.

324
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,000
Video games need more violence.

325
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is that how to get women into gaming?

326
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's how to get men into gaming.

327
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
More violence?

328
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'd like to see more titties in gaming.

329
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Definitely.

330
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Wait a minute.

331
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Wait a minute.

332
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
No, no, no.

333
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,640
We need boobs and blood.

334
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Exactly.

335
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
More guy-on-guy spanking.

336
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Wait, wait, wait.

337
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm...

338
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
I'm done with that.

339
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Women who...

340
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Okay, you guys are telling me that...

341
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:32,200
It's all about... it's all about Dead or Alive, Extreme, and Rumble Roses, and Rule of Roses

342
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,520
candy.

343
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,760
It's all about sequels to the Desperate Housewives PC game.

344
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,320
Because if there's a skill that's vastly needed in this world, it's, you know, cooking and

345
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
cleaning.

346
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,760
All right, going to the chat room for some comments, Jared Jay says, Rob, you just crossed

347
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,640
from respectable gay to stereotypical uber gay.

348
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,680
Whatever, girlfriend, whatever.

349
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
You don't know me.

350
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
I'm down.

351
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Oh, snap, girl.

352
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
No, that is so not me.

353
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
That is so not me.

354
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm sorry.

355
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
It's really not...

356
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,600
That's so not you when you're sober.

357
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,160
Yeah, when I'm drunk, maybe.

358
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Let's see.

359
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,480
Gaming Nerd says, my parents watched it one day.

360
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
It was pretty creepy.

361
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,440
JV Mon says, I hate gay, straight, or taken.

362
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Let's see.

363
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,040
Padrino says, what if the taken guy is gay?

364
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,200
I don't know.

365
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I don't know.

366
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
What if the taken guy is gay?

367
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,400
Yeah, there was the gay guy that was taken on the show before.

368
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,480
It's always a straight guy that's taken.

369
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,760
But see, here's the thing, though, and even when we talked it over and we were saying,

370
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
what if?

371
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,920
You know, we were put in that situation.

372
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
It's like, fuck that.

373
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,560
Just do whatever it takes to win the vacation.

374
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
We'll forgive you.

375
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
It's like, that's...

376
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
I don't know.

377
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,880
All you need to do is grab their junk and see which one gets an erection unless you're

378
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
really ugly.

379
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Then it doesn't work.

380
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
You know?

381
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
What if the taken one is in a bad relationship?

382
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
I'm sorry.

383
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Were we a video game podcast?

384
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Because I just...

385
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
I kind of forgot.

386
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
All right.

387
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Well, then I'm...

388
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm turning this car on.

389
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Games.

390
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Yeah.

391
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Jamie, how was your gaming week?

392
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
What type of video games have you been playing this week?

393
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Games with boobs.

394
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Oh, Dead or Alive?

395
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
No.

396
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
I...

397
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,920
My midterm is tomorrow for massage therapy, so I've actually been studying anatomy all

398
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,760
week and playing...

399
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,600
I did play a little bit of Cookie Mama just because I couldn't sleep.

400
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,600
And I was going to borrow Rule of Rose from Chris, and she couldn't find her...

401
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Couldn't find the game.

402
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
We found the case, but not the game.

403
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
So, oh well.

404
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,800
Oh, I did play...

405
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,240
I actually did play a whole crap load of Creature from the Black Lagoon Pinball.

406
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,760
A whole crap load of it.

407
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,920
And oh, I also played Twilight Zone.

408
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,840
Right now, though, we're fixing our Rocky and Bullinkle machine, and we got an Earthshaker,

409
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,800
which is old-school cool pinball.

410
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,440
Well, how are you fitting any more pinball machines in that?

411
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Aren't you going to be selling some?

412
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Oh, okay.

413
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
We have nine pinball machines.

414
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
No, you're not.

415
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,200
Well, one of them's Will's, because we gave him, we sold him our Judge Dredd, and we wanted

416
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
to get rid of the Johnny Mnemonic.

417
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,680
I told Dan that if he gets rid of the Star Trek pinball, I would murder him in his sleep.

418
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,480
So we're probably going to sell our Guns N' Roses machine.

419
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
And maybe...

420
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Aww, that's sad.

421
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
I love that machine.

422
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Well, then come over and play it before we sell it.

423
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm going to.

424
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,940
Because I need money for a Doffy's.

425
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940
After the show, okay?

426
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
And, and...

427
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

428
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,240
You're going to charge me quarters?

429
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
No.

430
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:23,480
We need to sell them so that I can use the money from Dan's pinball machines, mine.

431
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Alpha Canagram says, oh snap, Rocky and Bullinkle, oh snap.

432
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,560
I love Rocky and Bullinkle, but well, the problem with our Rocky and Bullinkle machine

433
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,240
is that we need a new, a new board for it, for a new, for the ROM set.

434
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,440
And right now the board's like, I'm going to be broken for a while and, you know, paying

435
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
for school.

436
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,280
I've got to decide what's more important, my education or pinball, which is really hard

437
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,120
choice, but you know.

438
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,600
Mike W says, don't worry, Mama will fix it.

439
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,880
Cookie Mama reference, of course.

440
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Insert ellipse here.

441
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Okay, thanks, bye.

442
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,680
You need to have Sugar Mama the game.

443
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,880
Yeah, I played that.

444
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Wow.

445
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,320
Loki, how was your gaming week?

446
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
My gaming week was good.

447
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,800
I played more of the Crackdown demo, again.

448
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,480
I found the grenade launcher, which, you know, makes the game a lot more fun.

449
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,680
And then, what else did I do?

450
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,040
I tried, oh, I played a little bit of, oh God, what the hell is that crappy PopCap game?

451
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,840
I don't know, some crappy PopCap game that's on live.

452
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,200
And yeah, I don't know, I just, trying to get you even points.

453
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,400
I got bored real quick, so.

454
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,560
And then, let's see, played more Resistance.

455
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm actually playing it the second time through, and you get some more weapons, so it's like

456
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,040
mildly fun, more fun, I guess.

457
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,920
And then, actually, ironically enough, we were over at my sister's house yesterday,

458
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,400
and once we got done playing board games, they popped in Driver 3, because they're borrowing

459
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
my PlayStation 2 right now.

460
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,440
And apparently, her and her boyfriend, their favorite thing to do now is to stay up late

461
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,760
at night playing this game, just watching how crappy the game is.

462
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,520
And it's so bad that we were actually watching my sister play it, and we knew we would watch

463
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,320
a replay of it, and the replay wasn't doing what she did in the game.

464
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,500
The replay actually glitched out, and it was, it looked like we were watching like the Discovery

465
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,440
Channel, like a video of some lizard or something, because the character kept ducking and popping

466
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,120
back up and stuff and running around, and it ended up in the water somehow.

467
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,960
And there was actually another time that she was driving, and this car falls, like it looks

468
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,800
like it drove off the top of a roof of a building and just like crashed into this background

469
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
all of a sudden.

470
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,200
I was like, what the fuck is this?

471
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,880
It was just so retarded, so I have to play more Driver 3 now, because I forgot how crappy

472
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,720
that game is, and probably now it's like dirt cheap, so maybe pick up an actual copy of

473
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,500
it instead of a pirated copy on my PlayStation 2 hard drive.

474
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,640
And then play it on the PlayStation 3.

475
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,160
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

476
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,480
Looking forward to playing some new stuff this week, hopefully.

477
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,120
Jared Jay says, oh god, I still can't believe I paid $50 for Driver 3 back in the day.

478
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
And you know what?

479
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,840
I can't believe I paid $50 for a game I played a little bit this week, Fusion Frenzy 2.

480
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,040
I picked up this game because the demo was kind of fun, and I thought, oh well, you know,

481
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,100
I love those little mini games, this will be, you know, a good time.

482
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,680
The best way I can describe this game is unpolished.

483
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,880
I mean, it's just, it feels sloppy, like all these little cutscenes are bleh, and the games

484
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
all look the same, and it's so bland.

485
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,600
How could a game with 40 mini games, that's basically think Mario Party without the big

486
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,860
board, be so frickin' bland?

487
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
But it is.

488
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,320
I was just so bored.

489
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,480
And then I'm thinking, like, Fusion Frenzy 1 really wasn't anything to write home about,

490
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
was it?

491
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Eddie, you watched me play this game, right?

492
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,520
Yeah, I just, I came over like an hour ago, and Rob was playing it.

493
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,200
It's just, it's really generic.

494
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,600
I mean, it looks like I revamped the graphics from, like, F-Zero on GameCube, and just like,

495
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,960
you know, they keep looping the same animation through.

496
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,240
Which is amazing, because the developers are completely different.

497
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,800
Yeah, but yeah, it, to me, had the same look to it, and it was just kind of generic, and

498
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,320
like, all the different, there's, the characters are all the same, it's just they're different

499
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,840
colors, and they use the same animation loops, like, over and over again, instead of actually,

500
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,720
like, having new cutscenes, and it's just, yeah, I just think they rush through it.

501
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,960
So I do not recommend Fusion Frenzy 2, unless you want easy achievement points.

502
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,760
Go rent it, because you can get through the achievements pretty easy, as I understand

503
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
it.

504
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,720
I racked up 75 pretty quickly, just playing through it once, and it wasn't anything that

505
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,140
difficult, so, yawn.

506
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,420
And I know we're going to talk later in the show about the rewards program, but it's,

507
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,900
for those of you guys that are hoping to get this as a reward, you might find that they're

508
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,480
just trying to unload the extra copies they're bound to have, because this game is not fun.

509
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
I'm sorry.

510
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Well, here's the thing, like, thank God that the Halo beta wasn't included with this game.

511
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,160
Good point.

512
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,000
Root Beer Tapper's another game I played this week on Xbox Live Arcade, and I love the old

513
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
school Tapper.

514
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,280
You know, I know a lot of people have been giving Microsoft some shit for putting up

515
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,320
all these, like, old classic video games up on Xbox Live recently, but actually the ones

516
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,600
that they put up recently, like Rally-X and Root Beer Tapper, I actually remember from

517
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,960
my childhood and love.

518
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,000
So the only problem with Root Beer Tapper is that they really didn't do much to it.

519
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,620
They put a co-op and competitive mode in it, but it's stupid.

520
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,560
You don't see the other player on your screen at all.

521
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,960
All you see is, you see their score and how they're progressing in the game.

522
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
That's it.

523
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,960
So it doesn't lend itself very much to a co-op or, and they didn't even redo the graphics

524
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,480
or anything, so, I mean, I guess it's good that it's only $5, which is the cheapest that

525
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,120
Microsoft will charge any game, but expect this game to be the free toss-in on a lot

526
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,520
of upcoming bundle stuff like Xbox Live cards and things, because I just, I don't think

527
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,520
it's, as much as I love Root Beer Tapper, it didn't get the same treatment a lot of

528
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,840
the other games did, therefore, I don't think it's as good of a value, and it pains me to

529
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
say that.

530
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,600
What's, I was just, you mentioned that it's $5 is the cheapest, that's how it is on the

531
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,800
Virtual Console and Nintendo, what is with that, I mean, to me, that's still kind of

532
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,120
expensive for a game that, like, came out, like, 20 years ago, you know, they made their

533
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,040
money on it, they're just selling the bits over the internet, it's just, it's kind of

534
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
weird to me.

535
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,440
A lot of people have been making the same complaints you have, does a game like, I don't

536
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
know, Tennis, and I'm not talking Wii Sports Tennis, I'm talking old-school 8-bit Tennis,

537
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,680
does this game like Tennis really justify the same price as a game like Super Mario

538
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Brothers?

539
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,120
Especially when I can go buy, like, a Nintendo for pretty cheap and buy the cartridges for

540
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:42,680
like 50 cents or less, I mean, it's like, or even if you want to go the illegal route,

541
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,040
download the ROM, which takes, like, a split second to download because it's really super

542
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,920
tiny, you know, only a few kilobytes, and it's like, wow, all this time that you, and

543
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,440
you didn't, they didn't add, like, multiplayer, no, if they added multiplayer over, you know,

544
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,040
their online network, oh, that's right, they don't have an online network, they just, you

545
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,200
know, Wii Connect 24, which just lets me know when there's a message to download, it doesn't

546
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,320
actually download the message.

547
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,680
Comments from our chat room, Jeremy Todd 1 says, I hate Root Beer Tapper, but of course,

548
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,000
I didn't play it a long time ago, so that nostalgia factor isn't there, but whatever,

549
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,800
I still think the game sucks.

550
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,580
Brad from Pod Culture says, I've been playing the hell out of Root Beer Tapper, fun times,

551
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,360
so differing opinions, I guess download the demo, see if it's something you like, so there

552
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
you go.

553
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,200
Alright, yeah, there's a chat room brawl breaking out over Root Beer Tapper, in fact, I think

554
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,280
some Root Beer glasses have just been shattered.

555
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,920
Why can't it just be Tapper with the beer?

556
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Because it was Budweiser, and that was sponsored, and so you got product placement in there,

557
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,340
it's like why you couldn't do Mike Tyson's Punch-Out now, right?

558
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,340
Same type of thing.

559
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,080
Because he bit people's ears off, that's why he can't.

560
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Yeah, he's a cannibal.

561
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,880
Yeah, actually, Nintendo is going to be re-skinning Punch-Out, and it's going to be Mike Tyson's

562
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,680
Ear-Biting and Women-Raping, actually is going to be coming out to the Wii Virtual Console,

563
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,300
for only $5, Eddie!

564
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,920
It's going to play like Oonga Boonga.

565
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,880
Get the Wii-mote and just like, thrust it in there.

566
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,360
For those that don't know what Oonga Boonga is, just don't look it up, just don't research

567
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,680
it, don't look it up on Wikipedia.

568
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,080
You should totally see it.

569
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Oh man, Loki.

570
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,840
You can address those cards and letters to loki at orangelonestrader.com.

571
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,720
It's the finger up the ass for a tickets game.

572
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,480
Why can't we have ticket games like that over here, that'd be hilarious.

573
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,360
Let's see, let's go over and check in with Rice Princess and Casper the Gay, and see

574
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,140
if there's anything they've been playing this week, real quick.

575
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,560
I've been playing Oonga Booga, but like, on my own body, with someone else, but I don't

576
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,680
want to spend tickets, I'm just like, ooh, awesome, keep playing.

577
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
You're disgusting.

578
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,000
Eddie, what have you been playing this week?

579
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I've been playing!

580
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay, what?

581
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Hat sex!

582
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,520
Are you guys drunk on this program tonight?

583
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
They're wearing hats.

584
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,640
I know this is radio, maybe we can take some pictures of both of them, but they're wearing

585
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
hats.

586
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,920
And like, Rice Princess is wearing a freakin' shamrock hat, that's like not even March yet.

587
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,400
Eddie, Casper the Gay, what have you been playing?

588
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,760
Yeah, big surprise, I downloaded Link the Bass when it came out on Virtual Console,

589
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,760
but I was kind of mad, I was like, that was $8, I was like, holy crap, but I was like,

590
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,720
you know, I haven't played that game in like 10 years, I should play it, but I mean, it's

591
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,120
like, it's cool, I love the old school stuff, but you know, it takes like 10 minutes now

592
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,200
to get all three pendants at the beginning, it's like, which is still fun though, I mean,

593
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,440
it's good old school stuff, but yeah, if Nintendo's listening, bring down your prices, I mean,

594
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,400
it's like, $2 for an NES game would not be too low.

595
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,840
Yes, actually, all of Nintendo is listening to this program, Reggie Fils-Aime is a very

596
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
loyal listener.

597
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Yeah, pretty much.

598
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Sure.

599
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,460
Oh, I forgot, I've been playing Super Mario World.

600
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,000
I beat it, I beat Super Mario World, because I'm awesome, I used Star World to get there

601
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
quickly.

602
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Hey, Rob, you know, I've beaten Super Mario World 2.

603
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Hey, Jamie, kiss my ass.

604
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,720
No, I don't know where that's been.

605
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
I'll help you out there, um.

606
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,240
You guys are filthy.

607
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,440
It's a tag, bonk.

608
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
All right, um.

609
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,360
You're being so brown, because, you know, it has to do with your butt, I guess, I don't

610
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
know.

611
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Oh my god!

612
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
I like your shirt.

613
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,360
We watched the bullshit episode about the ass last night.

614
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Video games, anybody?

615
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Has anybody played them?

616
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,280
I'm trying to segue into video games again by commenting on your shirt.

617
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Oh, sure, yes.

618
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
It's a lovely shirt.

619
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,400
I am, I'm wearing a very hot tanooki shirt, I'm gonna pose for the camera right now, look

620
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,360
at me, I'm all sexy, I'm, you know, god damn it.

621
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,320
You can't even see the tanooki when you do that, Rob, move your fucking microphone.

622
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,720
This is great radio, by the way.

623
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,200
No, it's not at all.

624
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
It's never been good.

625
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,520
We were just gonna mention my shirt, yes, I have a tanooki Mario in my shirt.

626
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,200
You know, I got accosted by a stranger in Radio Shack today, it was like, no, seriously,

627
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,600
this is how it went, dude, dude, that's an awesome shirt, dude, that is an awesome shirt.

628
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,000
Did you walk into the fraternity in Radio Shack or something?

629
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,960
Apparently so, because the guy's like, dude, that shirt is awesome, dude, I just got a

630
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,040
wee today, I got a wee at Target, I swear to god, I'm not making this up, and then the

631
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,360
woman behind the counter was like, um, was that the Mario where you, like, killed things

632
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
with your tail?

633
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,080
Because I'm not sure, because I've been sitting behind here all day doing nothing, and it's

634
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,960
starting to get my brain, because nobody shops at Radio Shack.

635
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Rob.

636
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
What?

637
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,120
Oh, more pictures, I feel like a- Do you want a satellite TV?

638
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,440
I feel like Anna Nicole Smith, only alive, this is nice.

639
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,240
I'm taking a picture of Rob's shirt, one, two, five.

640
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Ah, thank you.

641
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
It's blurry, oh well.

642
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,160
All right, anyway, let's get- And I'm not uploading it either.

643
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,280
Let's get into some actual gaming news, because we don't really have any housekeeping tonight.

644
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Visit our Myspace- I do.

645
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Oh, you have some housekeeping?

646
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
What do you want to say?

647
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,080
Well, just that you need some housekeeping.

648
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Shut up.

649
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,640
Loki, save this show with some awesome exclusives, that would be, like, the best thing ever,

650
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,160
if you could, like, give us some video game news no one's heard yet.

651
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,320
How about the entire lineup for Xbox 360 from Microsoft this year, that'd be great.

652
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
How about that?

653
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:12,360
Let's start off, then, with Blue Dragon, which has been announced now for July 11th, so look

654
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,520
forward to that.

655
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,480
Project Silpheed on the 360.

656
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Awesome.

657
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:27,080
For May 16th, Tenchu Z coming out June 12th, Two Human also May 16th, Mass Effect coming

658
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:35,280
out May 30th, Shadowrun June 13th, Forza 2 is slated for May 16th as well, man, that's

659
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,480
going to be a pretty big day, because I know Halo 3 is set around that time, too.

660
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm sure some of this stuff is going to move, but.

661
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,400
And then on top of all those games we have coming out, of course, they're going to be

662
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,080
having a 4,000 point live card coming out in April, so if you didn't really want to

663
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,280
spend $20 on live points at the store, now you can spend $40 on live points at the store,

664
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,360
or actually, no, that's more than $50, I'm sorry.

665
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,720
I was kind of wondering at first why they would be doing this, but then I think the

666
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,360
movie rentals, you know, you can spend a lot of points really quickly on the movie rentals,

667
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,520
so folks that are downloading the HD movies, I can see.

668
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,280
Those cards sell well because people buy them as gifts, so.

669
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
I can see that.

670
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,760
They're like iTunes cards.

671
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Exactly.

672
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,920
So, that's going to be pretty cool.

673
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,840
Tetris Evolution is actually coming out.

674
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,760
Remember, Tetris Grandmaster was one of the launch titles in Japan, now it's making it

675
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
over here.

676
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,080
This 360 game I've seen, this is a retail price point of $29.99 when it's coming out

677
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
in March.

678
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Good job.

679
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,480
A moment of applause, please, for this.

680
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,360
Applause, please.

681
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Low price points are awesome.

682
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
That was the wrong one-handed clap.

683
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
I've got some bad news, though.

684
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,840
That doesn't sound one-handed clapping.

685
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:49,640
Mario Party 8 has been delayed to June, or not June, May 15th, so I don't know.

686
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
How do you know this?

687
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,120
This is groundbreaking news.

688
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,960
Because us distributors talk to the publishers on a daily basis, so they will give us updates

689
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,600
to dates all the time, and even usually before press releases go out we get announcements

690
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,800
for stuff that hasn't been announced yet, or maybe announced at certain retail spots

691
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,800
but no one's paying attention.

692
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Don't worry, guys.

693
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,560
You can play Fusion Frenzy 2 in the meantime and then poop on it because it's bad.

694
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,840
Because you had to play Fusion Frenzy.

695
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,200
Well, to be honest, though, most of the Wii games coming out now have party games in them.

696
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,440
I know Sonic the Hedgehog, the brand new one, Sonic and the Secret Rings, has actually party

697
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
games in it as well.

698
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
They look kind of fun.

699
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Wait.

700
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
I have a question.

701
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Yes.

702
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Rice Princess has a question.

703
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Yes.

704
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Are the Secret Rings cock rings?

705
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Low key.

706
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:46,600
And then finally, the remakes, Final Fantasy I and II, are slated for the PSP June 13th.

707
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
That's huge.

708
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,880
So that'll be pretty nice as well.

709
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
Wow.

710
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,760
Those are some huge dates you're giving us there.

711
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,040
Good job, Low Key.

712
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,480
So I'm just glad to see that some actual games are coming out.

713
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm not sure if Microsoft's going to be stacking that many games in May.

714
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,560
They might try to shuffle stuff around a little bit to kind of spread out the fun, but lots

715
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,160
of good stuff for the summer.

716
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Awesome.

717
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,640
Did you just paste that picture of my shirt?

718
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Yes, I did.

719
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
Oh my gosh.

720
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Oh wow.

721
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,000
And you can see my big fat stomach in there.

722
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's very nice.

723
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Good job.

724
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,260
I got a cool shirt today.

725
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,880
Some of the perks of being in our chat room live when the show is going on Sunday at 6

726
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
o'clock.

727
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
What'd you get?

728
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
This is Captain America for President.

729
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,400
I love Captain America.

730
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,160
I want a shirt that says Reggie Fils-Aime for President, because he would regulate.

731
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I'd go for Captain America.

732
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,560
And then like Link could be Vice President.

733
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,000
That would be awesome.

734
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
What?

735
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
What?

736
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,040
Rice Princess, you remember the rule in the studio is if you say something, you have to

737
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
say it in a mic.

738
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Yeah, damn it.

739
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Rob, I hate you.

740
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
I've hated you for years.

741
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Oh, thank you.

742
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I love you too.

743
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Aww.

744
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Aww.

745
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Don't really touch me, Rob.

746
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,200
What the hell is wrong with the program tonight?

747
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
I don't know.

748
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,680
Oh, Fireboma says Sky needs to lose a good 200 pounds.

749
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Who?

750
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
In related news, Fireboma.

751
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
No, no, no.

752
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Who?

753
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Fireboma.

754
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Fireboma, out.

755
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,800
In related news, Fireboma just got kicked from chat.

756
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
There you go.

757
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Yay.

758
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Fireboma, you're out.

759
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Yeah.

760
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,040
If you come back in, Fireboma, I'm going to sit on you.

761
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,360
For those who have never seen Rob, he's like the skinniest man ever.

762
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
What?

763
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,640
The only way your ass would weight 500 pounds is if you wore a metal diaper and you pooped

764
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
in it.

765
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,960
Anyway, God, what is wrong with this program tonight?

766
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Shit.

767
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Pure shit.

768
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,680
No, I was just saying that I saw a really cute shirt that was caps lock, cruise control

769
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,240
for awesome, and I really want that shirt a lot.

770
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
What is that a reference to?

771
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
I don't even get it.

772
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
Do you know what caps lock is?

773
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,920
Well, I know what the caps lock is, but- It's cruise control for awesome.

774
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Hello.

775
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
You don't get it?

776
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,600
I saw this other one where the front says ding and on the back it says grats.

777
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,040
I really want that one.

778
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
That one I get.

779
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Yeah.

780
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
You would because you're a nerd.

781
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Yeah.

782
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
I've been playing lots of World of Warcraft this week, by the way.

783
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
So have I.

784
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
All right.

785
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Anyhow.

786
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,440
Boo.

787
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,680
Let's go into some other news.

788
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,840
I promised last week we would have some news on the Alice movie.

789
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,920
This would be American McGee's Alice, as you know, being made into a movie.

790
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,200
Now, I apologize to the source because I don't think I'm supposed to name the source, but

791
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,000
if you want it to be named, then I apologize, but this information is coming from a very

792
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,760
trusted source of Orange Lounge Radio, somebody I've been working with for a while who just

793
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,320
happened to come across this.

794
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,360
I can't really say how, but got to read the script, the current script as it is for Alice.

795
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,120
Now keep in mind, these things change all the time.

796
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,600
So I know a lot of folks are going to sit out there and go, yeah, right, OLR is full

797
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
of it.

798
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,080
I reasonably believe this is accurate, the way the movie stands today.

799
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,160
It doesn't sound like BS.

800
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,080
It sounds pretty legit, but it might change by the time the movie comes out.

801
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,840
I'm curious what you guys think of this.

802
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,880
So here, I'm going to read from this, and I want to say thanks again to our source.

803
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,360
So I'm going to keep anonymous, but if you want me to name you, let me know.

804
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
I'll name you next week.

805
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,080
Alice as a child is confronted by her parents due to her uncontrollable fascination with

806
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
Wonderland.

807
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,960
Against Alice's protest that Wonderland exists, Alice's father takes down possibly

808
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,120
anything in her room that would insinuate any thought related to Wonderland.

809
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,180
Later that night, the house is burned down, and the only survivor found is Alice, splattered

810
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,240
with blood on her body.

811
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,400
Forward to the future, Alice is staying in a mental institution.

812
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:35,680
An MD, Dr. Hatfield, is interested in Alice and transfers her to another institution,

813
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,120
even though doctors tell Hatfield that Alice is impossible to cure.

814
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,680
Alice then begins a new treatment at the new institution, which is looking more and more

815
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,000
abnormal to Alice.

816
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,400
Alice's old meds are no longer given to her.

817
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,600
The other patients are deranged, but one sane doctor named Doyle seems to be the only

818
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,560
sane one, and Alice pleads to him for help as she claims she's not who or what she

819
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
really is.

820
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,360
Alice's treatments are getting worser and crueler and gets wind of Hatfield's surgeries.

821
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,640
After escaping a scuffle from getting into her first surgery, she follows a rabbit she

822
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,240
barely saw in the middle of her struggle and follows it into you-know-where.

823
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,280
Apparently, there were some notes on the script as well, some possible movies, because some

824
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,760
movie names were written on here, some movies that this could be influenced from.

825
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,360
12 Monkeys, 7, Perfect Storm, Pan's Labyrinth, Jacob's Ladder, What Dreams May Come, Lord

826
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,880
of the Rings, and then some bands were written on there as well, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry,

827
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,760
Butthole Surfers, specifically Chris Vrenna of Nine Inch Nails as well, Electronic Industrial

828
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,000
Hip Hop Music, and then this is the movie genre, Psycho Horror Action.

829
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,480
So what do you think?

830
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,600
Sounds kind of neat?

831
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Sounds true to the game?

832
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
What do you think?

833
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
It sounds neat.

834
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,960
I haven't played the game, but it sounds neat.

835
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,520
I did years ago, but I don't remember it very well.

836
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,000
I watched a speed run of the game.

837
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Did you?

838
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It could be okay.

839
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah, so it sounds like it could be interesting.

840
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,440
Mention a movie I saw today.

841
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
What's that?

842
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
I saw Pan's Labyrinth today.

843
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Oh, how was that?

844
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,600
Did you like that?

845
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,360
My roommate's been raving about that.

846
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,600
I didn't know if I should cry or be happy, so I just went, oh, it was really good.

847
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Interesting.

848
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Okay.

849
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Let's see.

850
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
I'm going...

851
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Except the original title wasn't even Pan's Labyrinth.

852
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,200
I don't know why they called it that.

853
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,680
The Rob D says Alice then gets treatment from a Dr. House, making reference to the TV show,

854
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
I guess.

855
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,400
JV Mon says, this sounds awesome.

856
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,680
So it could be very interesting.

857
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,720
Padrino says, I do believe it can be real since the scripts have to make the rounds.

858
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,600
I believe it's real too, but I think, as most scripts do, it's probably going to change

859
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,120
a bunch before we see the final product.

860
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
But there you have it.

861
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,840
Your first look into what the Alice movie has in store.

862
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,080
All right.

863
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,840
So how about some other news circulating the internet this week?

864
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,520
Well, there's a little bit of happiness going on.

865
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:54,520
For all of us who have been begging and pleading for Nintendo to do a kitty-kitty version of

866
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,360
Nintendogs, well, somebody else is doing it.

867
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,080
Crave is putting out Purr Pals for the DS.

868
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,520
You can choose 40 breeds of kitties, and pet them, and love them, and call them George,

869
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,160
and you can raise them, you know.

870
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,280
It's funny this mentions modifying cat behavior.

871
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
No.

872
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,080
You just call them modified cats.

873
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
Cats modify your behavior.

874
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,280
Am I the only one disappointed that they did not call this Pussy Pals?

875
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,000
Yes, you are.

876
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,080
I love that this article put up a cat macro, though.

877
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,840
It says, where is your god now?

878
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,200
Are you going to be picking up Purr Pals?

879
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Probably.

880
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Can it do Nintendogs justice?

881
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Because, just, just.

882
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,920
It's a really different graphical style.

883
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
What's a kitty?

884
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,280
The graphical style is totally different from, like, a Nintendogs.

885
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,560
It's not realistic cats.

886
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,120
It's like cartoony alien cats.

887
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Well, then never mind.

888
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,260
They have a video of it on iGn.

889
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,680
They have a video of it on other sites?

890
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,800
I usually avoid iGn, like, the plague, though.

891
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
You know.

892
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,240
Except, except I got Matthew Brando with blood.

893
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
They do have a lot of videos.

894
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,680
You know, there was a cats game that's already been out on the DS that you can do the exact

895
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
same thing.

896
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,480
It's called Cats with a Z at the end, you know, because they're extreme.

897
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
I don't know.

898
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
They do a dogs one, too.

899
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
Yeah, they have the dogs, horses, hamsters.

900
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,280
Wait, do these cats, like, go base jumping and, like, extreme snowboarding and stuff?

901
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,480
They're hardcore cats.

902
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,040
They do crystal meth and go to raves.

903
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,840
Wow.

904
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,240
They should have it, like, you know, they should have it where the cats actually start

905
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,520
scratching the DS, and you're like, what the fuck?

906
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,720
Why is there a throw up in my DS, you know, just stuff like that.

907
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,200
They should hack up hairballs and then poo on your, you know, your bathroom rug.

908
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,960
Of course, the chat room is all clamoring out in unison for Love Hamster, which was

909
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
a game we talked about.

910
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,820
Hamster does not have a P in it.

911
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,240
The Rob D says, you're just an intense pussy, Rob.

912
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,920
Anyway, speaking of crap, Codemasters' last Bubble Bobble game, Bubble Bobble Revolution,

913
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,600
was crap because you couldn't pass level 30.

914
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,120
What kind of a game is that?

915
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,680
Well, they're going back and recalling them so you can actually send it into Codemasters

916
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,080
and get a brand new copy that'll be fixed, and you can actually pass level 30.

917
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,280
That's good to know.

918
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,440
So if you happen to be unfortunate enough to have bought this game and haven't sold

919
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,840
it back yet, you may want to seek a better copy from Codemasters.

920
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,200
I think it would be great if there were only 31 levels, so they like send it in and it's

921
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,800
only one more level, and it's like, oh, okay.

922
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Gotcha.

923
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Wow.

924
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:46,440
Yeah, and that's the same, GS68 has the same thing in chat, but can you pass level 31?

925
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Don't know.

926
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
What do you think, guys?

927
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,040
Now, do we ease up on the folks behind Bubble Bobble for the DS and not make any more level

928
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
30 jokes?

929
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
No.

930
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,760
You know what I think it really was?

931
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,800
I think they just didn't finish it on time, so they purposely made it so you couldn't

932
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,520
pass 30, and so that gave them more time to create more levels and stuff.

933
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,080
And they're like, yeah, now we've fixed it.

934
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,400
Yeah, now you can totally get past level 30.

935
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,760
I've read an interesting theory about that this is just a reflection of the general laziness

936
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,880
in QA and testing, because what the 360 and other next-gen systems have allowed you to

937
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,640
do with patching, because companies are too spoiled now with the whole patching thing.

938
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,040
If bugs are discovered, eh, they can go back and patch it.

939
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,920
But the problem is you can't really patch a DS game without doing a massive recall.

940
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,800
So I mean, is this maybe why this happened?

941
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Possibly.

942
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,440
I mean, they obviously didn't play test it, because if, you know, oh, I can't pass level

943
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
30.

944
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
I just must suck.

945
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,880
I mean, other people would be better than I am.

946
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,600
All right.

947
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,040
Well moving on into other news, speaking of big letdowns, you might remember we even got

948
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,900
a call on this last week.

949
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,760
Somebody had said, hey, what do you think Konami's big announcement is?

950
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,860
Because remember we gave the rundown on Konami Gamer's Day last week, right, about the show

951
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,240
and all the games we played.

952
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,560
But Konami had put on their site, hey, boys and girls, stay tuned until Monday, because

953
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,180
we got some big shit, yo, that we're going to be laying down.

954
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
What was it?

955
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,180
I know what it is.

956
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,180
What?

957
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,000
They released a controller that you could play Frogger on.

958
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,040
No, that's actually old news.

959
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,000
I forgot to mention that during my gaming week.

960
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,120
I think that they released it, somebody had diarrhea when they went out.

961
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,080
Actually, I forgot to mention that Rice Princess and Casper the Gay and Xtaphir all got me

962
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,460
this little USB Frogger controller.

963
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,240
And all you have to do is plug it into the USB port and it installs the game and you

964
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
can play it.

965
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,520
And I'm here to tell you, the game sucks.

966
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Balls.

967
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,720
Horrible, horrible, sloppy, wrinkly balls is what this game sucks.

968
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
It's horrid.

969
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Ew.

970
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
That's gross.

971
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,800
And I spent more time staring at the now loading screen than I did actually playing the game.

972
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,560
Well, that's half the fun.

973
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,480
Was this like on clearance?

974
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
No.

975
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Yeah, meaning yes.

976
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Not.

977
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
How many dollars am I holding up?

978
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Yes.

979
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,840
Was it seriously four bucks?

980
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Wow.

981
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
It might be worth four bucks.

982
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,760
Not to make fun of Konami or anything, but I know.

983
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Hey, look.

984
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,480
We gave glowing reviews of Gamers' Day last week, so I think I can say this shitty little

985
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,000
four dollar thing sucks, okay?

986
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,720
They're not going to cry.

987
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,880
Do you remember the first Gamers' Day we went to and even the second, like that summer thing,

988
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,480
that they had like a whole booth set up that they'd show you how to use the USB key thing?

989
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,840
I'm like, you fucking just plug it into a USB port.

990
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
How hard is that?

991
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,360
Uh, I can't get it in there right.

992
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
What the hell?

993
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,640
I mean, literally you just plug it in and it goes.

994
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,560
I mean, how do you fuck that up?

995
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,200
It's not supposed to go in my ass?

996
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Damn it.

997
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,640
Alright, well anyway, so Konami, even though we've gotten way off track, Konami said they

998
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,200
were going to make this big announcement on Monday, and then here it was.

999
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Here was the big announcement.

1000
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Here it is.

1001
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,240
Last week, Konami announced new games in its Castlevania and DDR series.

1002
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,440
It's going to be an incredible 2007, so stay tuned to these pages for the latest from Konami.

1003
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,800
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

1004
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,120
I mean, everybody was thinking, oh, it's going to be the Metal Gear Solid 4 information.

1005
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,640
Oh, it's going to be Silent Hill Origins.

1006
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Oh, Silent Hill 5.

1007
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,760
No, it was, hey, our big announcement is that we already made our announcement.

1008
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Sorry.

1009
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
What?

1010
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
That's it?

1011
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
That was it.

1012
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Not even a reach around?

1013
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
No.

1014
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Nothing.

1015
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
I'm bitter.

1016
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Nothing.

1017
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
No.

1018
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,280
Any shitty, shitty, USB Frogger games for everybody.

1019
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
Yay.

1020
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
No.

1021
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,760
If only Bar Man Act Zero were $4.

1022
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,640
I'm tempted to wrap this up in toilet paper and give it away on the station to a lucky

1023
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
listener.

1024
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,280
Wait, is there going to be poop on that toilet paper?

1025
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
No, maybe.

1026
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Ew.

1027
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
But I don't want it.

1028
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
No.

1029
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Maybe some Hershey's Kisses or something.

1030
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
All right.

1031
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Anyway.

1032
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,280
From your butt.

1033
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
What is wrong with tonight's program?

1034
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
I don't know.

1035
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,320
Rice Princess and Eddie the Gay are here, but this program's off tonight.

1036
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,520
Did you say Eddie the Gay?

1037
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Eddie the Gay.

1038
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
Eddie Casper the Gay.

1039
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,520
That's his full name, right?

1040
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,520
I know I'm awesome.

1041
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
All right.

1042
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
Who's got the next story?

1043
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Is it me?

1044
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Your mom.

1045
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Oh, no.

1046
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Jamie, I believe it's you.

1047
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Is it?

1048
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Oh.

1049
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Yes.

1050
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
I'm not your mom.

1051
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,040
That would be wrong.

1052
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,960
Looks like Activision has a hair up their ass because they're suing their own people.

1053
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,080
Not really their own people, but they're suing people who worked on Guitar Hero now.

1054
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:43,760
Remember that whole big stink they were having with the Ant Commandos for the unlicensed

1055
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
guitar controller?

1056
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:53,160
Well, they're suing them again and also including as defendants some folks that were with Red

1057
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Octane previously, that would be John Tam, Corey Fong.

1058
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,880
Wasn't John Tam the dude that went to your house?

1059
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Yes, he is.

1060
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
How funny.

1061
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
He was pretty funny.

1062
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
I mean, not funny.

1063
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
I'm sorry, John.

1064
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
It's not funny, but just interesting.

1065
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Sorry.

1066
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Small world.

1067
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,720
I'll just sit down and shut up.

1068
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,760
Well, also included is Corey Fong and Jamie Yang, who were...

1069
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,160
They actually started another company since then that's working in conjunction with the

1070
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Ant Commandos.

1071
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,640
So, in other words, these guys left Red Octane to go work with the Ant Commandos on a yet

1072
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,720
unannounced game that probably has something to do with guitars?

1073
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,920
Well, Activision is accusing them of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, misappropriating

1074
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,720
trade secrets and confidential information, breach of contract, interference with constructional

1075
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,880
relations and being stinky.

1076
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm glad they don't remember before 2005.

1077
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:00,080
I mean, just, hmm, Guitar Freaks, ring a bell, anybody, no.

1078
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,800
I even brought that up in a conversation, like, well, yeah, but we're different.

1079
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
No, you're not.

1080
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
To be fair, they are.

1081
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,840
Okay, they have five buttons.

1082
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,940
Guitar Hero, no, it's more than that.

1083
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,940
You know it.

1084
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:17,480
The game has a completely different look and feel than Guitar Freaks does, and it's crossed

1085
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,040
over into popularity in a way.

1086
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
I'm sorry.

1087
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
I'm sorry, Bomani fans.

1088
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
Guitar Freaks could never do.

1089
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
Okay, fine.

1090
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,760
If I put Keyboard Mania and made it look like Karaoke Revolution, oh, look, I got Keyboard

1091
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,840
Hero.

1092
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,080
That's all they fucking did is they changed the way the game looks.

1093
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,360
Okay, great.

1094
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,040
The notes come at me instead of straight up.

1095
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,200
You know what other game did the exact same thing?

1096
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
In the groove.

1097
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:44,800
Is that different from you have a game like, I don't know, you have a platformer game like

1098
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,860
Mario where he jumps and hits things, and then you have another game with a hero, like,

1099
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,480
I don't know, The Legend of Kage where he jumps and hits things.

1100
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
I don't know.

1101
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
That's really obscure.

1102
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
It's exactly the same.

1103
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
That's exactly the same.

1104
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
It's a move on.

1105
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
So why isn't it a problem there?

1106
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,760
Because they're stupid and they don't want to make a big fuss about it.

1107
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,760
But here's the thing.

1108
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
Here's where I have a problem.

1109
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,920
I have a problem when you have the second person to come along and copy something and

1110
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,320
say, oh, we're the originators of this stuff.

1111
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,940
Bullshit, you were the originators.

1112
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,720
You have no room to talk because this other company wants to make a guitar game.

1113
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,840
That's just like when Street Fighter II was out there and then fighting games became popular.

1114
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,840
You know what?

1115
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,720
If say Mortal Kombat or whatever came down the line.

1116
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,720
Mortal Kombat.

1117
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,720
Thank you.

1118
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
That's an excellent example.

1119
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,720
What about King of Fighters?

1120
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
What about World Heroes?

1121
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
What about Art of Fighting?

1122
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
What about Street Fighter?

1123
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,760
Well, Art of Fighting, World Heroes and King of Fighters were all SNK so they could get

1124
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
away with it.

1125
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
That's fine.

1126
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,760
Here's what I'm saying.

1127
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
But they're all Street Fighter.

1128
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,760
Here's what I'm saying, though.

1129
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,040
Fatal Fury actually had multi-plane fighting, but sorry.

1130
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,480
Okay, well, here's what I'm saying.

1131
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,160
If the fucking originators of Fatal Fury came out and said, oh, we're pissed off that people

1132
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,320
are copying our game, no, fuck them.

1133
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,960
They were second in line or third in line.

1134
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,380
They have no room to talk.

1135
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,760
It's just like, you know, if the originators of In the Groove came out and said, oh, well,

1136
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,720
we're pissed off that, you know, Dance Factory came out, well, fuck you, you copied someone

1137
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
else.

1138
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,040
The fighting games were actually around well before Street Fighter, but also, let's not

1139
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,560
forget, though, remember the old houses for Obscure?

1140
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,440
Pac-Man versus KC Crazy Chase for The Odyssey 2.

1141
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,280
That game is now so hard to find because of being sued by Williams and Midway, but it's

1142
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,280
the same thing.

1143
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,660
Maze games have been around in a physical form before there were, remember the old mouse

1144
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,520
trap games?

1145
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,080
They existed beforehand.

1146
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:41,280
I just think it's just a double standard right now that they really, well, the whole problem

1147
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,920
is that Konami didn't do anything to, you know, protect their guitar freaks, you know,

1148
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,020
patents or whatever they had there, so now they can't really, you know, stand on that.

1149
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:55,440
But I still think it's retarded that they're suing over, you know, this game that, you

1150
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,840
know what, Harmonix is working on something else right now and it's gonna blow this shit

1151
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,720
away and then whatever, everyone's gonna get a big boner over that, so whatever.

1152
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,680
Anywho, speaking of Guitar Hero, Activision is definitely showing their interest in Nintendo

1153
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:19,080
platforms talking about doubling their, or aggressively targeting the Wii and DS for

1154
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,880
titles such as, you know, the Spider-Man Shrek, etc., and talking about bringing Guitar Hero

1155
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,880
to the Wii.

1156
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,160
Although, what I've been reading, though, is it might not actually be Guitar Hero, might

1157
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:36,680
be some other guitar game, but still, though, yeah, I guess you could do that, but the DS,

1158
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,680
I don't know about that, that'd be kinda dumb, but we'll see.

1159
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,680
Yeah, how exactly do you do Guitar Hero on the DS?

1160
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,680
Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap, that's kinda dumb.

1161
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,680
Yeah.

1162
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,780
I don't know.

1163
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,680
Maybe something would like you hold the chords with the stylus, I don't know, that's kinda

1164
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,080
lame, but then that's why I don't design games, I guess.

1165
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,160
Maybe I'll have a fun peripheral.

1166
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,520
Anyhow, some other Konami music game related news, I should state, by the way, we were

1167
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:09,840
the first website anywhere in the planet to run the official song list of DDR Universe

1168
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,000
on the Xbox 360, the default song list is what it's gonna look like there.

1169
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,120
Our very own staffer Mel B. did some work on that and found that, so if you wanna see

1170
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,040
that, head on over to orangeontree.com.

1171
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,920
Very interesting lineup, I gotta say, Cascada, every time we touch is in it, Rapper's Delight

1172
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,320
by the Sugarhill Gang is in it, that's gotta be fun, and Kylie Minogue is in it as well,

1173
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,320
so it's gonna be fun.

1174
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,720
I hope it has an equally retarded video like it did in Pump It Up.

1175
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,040
I don't know, we'll see.

1176
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,040
That was hilarious.

1177
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:42,440
Also, I wanted to say this regarding official Konami music games, there's an interesting

1178
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,920
report on Bomani Style that was run earlier this week, we received our first confirmation

1179
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,760
from Betzen that Beatmania 2DX Arcade will soon be testing in the next few weeks in Illinois

1180
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,760
at Brunswick Zone in Naperville.

1181
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:02,800
No version has been confirmed as of yet, although it is rumored to be Beatmania 2DX Gold.

1182
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,960
What this is basically saying is that, possibly, Betzen could be distributing Beatmania 2DX

1183
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Gold here in the States.

1184
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,020
Usually Beatmania 2DX machines have to be imported from other countries, which is why

1185
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,180
you see them so, so rarely.

1186
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:20,000
But very interesting that they would do this now, because Konami didn't announce a Beatmania

1187
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,680
2 at their Gamers' Day, and they came out with Beatmania 1 last year, which makes me

1188
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,320
think, I don't know if Beatmania 2 is coming out for the home.

1189
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,880
So what would be the strategy of them trying to release one in the arcades?

1190
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,360
I don't know.

1191
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
What do you think, though?

1192
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,880
Do you think they should release Beatmania 2DX over here in the arcades, or do you think

1193
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,880
it's a lost cause?

1194
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,340
Well, there's been places that have had it for years anyway.

1195
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,200
But they're very niche places, you know?

1196
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,960
Yeah, and the thing is, is that the majority of arcades are really going to be really lazy

1197
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,040
and not want to upkeep that type of machine.

1198
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,280
So if it's going to be around, it's only going to be at major places that are guaranteed

1199
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,280
to be well-kept.

1200
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,200
Other than that, they're going to be wasting however many thousand dollars a machine is

1201
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,120
on something they don't want to keep up.

1202
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,820
JV Mon says, get hype through the arcades, and then people would be like, hey, I want

1203
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,820
to play that at home.

1204
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:11,200
So maybe this is a way for them to re-light a fire under the Beatmania franchise at home.

1205
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,200
I don't know.

1206
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:17,320
I had heard the series didn't do that bad, but the fact that they didn't announce the

1207
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,440
sequel kind of makes you worry.

1208
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,440
Eh, not really, because I'm wondering if they just don't know what they're going to do with

1209
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,440
platforms.

1210
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,040
I mean, if you think about it, say they haven't started Beatmania 2 yet, where's the PlayStation

1211
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,200
2 going to be, say, in November?

1212
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,520
I mean, they don't know.

1213
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,480
So it's kind of a risky thing to do.

1214
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,000
That's why there weren't really any PlayStation 2 games announced at Gamers' Day.

1215
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,120
Gaming Nerd says something interesting, 2DX barely gets any money in the U.S. to begin

1216
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,120
with.

1217
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
2DX Gold will be no different.

1218
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:52,160
But what if they take the Beatmania 2DX machines out of the niche arcades that have them now,

1219
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,720
you know, the arcades that are willing to import games, and they put them in your local

1220
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,720
bowling alley?

1221
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,080
You know, your local other arcade would stand to make more.

1222
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,840
And plus, the machines are going to be cheaper if they're done here domestically.

1223
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,760
They're going to be half as much, I think.

1224
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,760
I don't know.

1225
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,760
I'm just guessing.

1226
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,600
But they might stand to make more in profit.

1227
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,600
Just a thought.

1228
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,920
Especially those machines, it's just that they have, you know, the giant plasma screen

1229
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
on it and stuff.

1230
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,400
I mean, granted, there are a lot of machines nowadays that have, you know, giant plasma

1231
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,400
screens.

1232
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,640
But, you know, I know with Golf Land, for example, we have little kids fucking breaking

1233
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
that shit.

1234
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:31,880
You know, replacing a plasma screen isn't cheap, and that's, you know, bad.

1235
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,280
One can only hope, though, that if we're going to get it, it's going to at least be in good

1236
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,280
shape.

1237
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:41,720
I have a little bit of something that will be in good shape, because, well, it's brand

1238
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,720
new.

1239
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,800
So, we have our UK release dates.

1240
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
How's that sound?

1241
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Yippee!

1242
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:53,000
Coming out on the 16th is a bunch of stuff.

1243
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,280
We have Armed Assault, or is it Arm A, I guess?

1244
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,200
Arthur and the Invisibles, Cartoon Network Racing, Excite Truck, God Hand, Infernal,

1245
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,720
Mario Hoops 3 on 3, Over the Hedge, Hammy Goes Nuts, Sherlock Holmes, The Awakened,

1246
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:15,800
Supreme Commander, Toko Race Driver 3, and Tortuga, Two Treasures.

1247
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,120
Great.

1248
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,480
Wow.

1249
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,720
Great.

1250
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,120
Sorry, I seem kind of short.

1251
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,120
Well, it's...

1252
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,200
Yeah, I guess it's a slow month.

1253
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,120
I'm looking at the Japanese release dates, they're not much longer, but...

1254
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,120
Yeah.

1255
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,040
I mean, the U.S., it's a pretty decent week, at least.

1256
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,400
We're going to see some new stuff for the Wii with Wii Play, so if you're short a remote

1257
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,520
and need to buy one for cheap, Wii Play is the way to go.

1258
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,520
And then, of course, if you're not in, or don't have a Wii, on PlayStation 2, Ghost

1259
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:52,320
Rider, which is kind of a rip-off of God of War, but, you know, God of War's not a bad

1260
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,920
game, so definitely worth checking out.

1261
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,320
It's also cheap, only $29.99.

1262
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,560
I played Ghost Rider at E3, I don't know how much the game's changed, I mean, granted it's

1263
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,560
been six months.

1264
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,080
But that game sucked ass at E3, I'm sorry, it was horrid.

1265
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,560
It looks a lot better now.

1266
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,000
Well, that's encouraging, because maybe they took all the negative feedback from E3 and

1267
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
did some retooling, so...

1268
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,200
I think so, it looks pretty...

1269
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,560
Alright, then I retract my statement, a game can change a lot in six months.

1270
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,800
It looks very similar to God of War, like a very ripped-off God of War.

1271
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,560
Anyways, the Warriors is coming out on PSP, and that's pretty inexpensive as well, only

1272
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,320
$19.99, so definitely check it out.

1273
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,880
Ratchet & Clank Size Matters on the PSP, if you're a Ratchet & Clank fan.

1274
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,760
Galactic Civilizations 2, Dark Avatar, the expansion pack for that game is finally coming

1275
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,760
out.

1276
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,880
Test Drive Unlimited on PC, finally making its way to market.

1277
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:50,560
Gurumen, A Monsterous Adventure on the PSP, brand new Atlus game.

1278
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:56,280
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas on the PSP, lots of PSP love this week.

1279
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:02,280
Monster Kingdom Jewel Summoner... what?

1280
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,280
I'm sorry, I...

1281
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,280
Stop making comments behind me!

1282
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:10,120
No, we're not making comments at you, I've been, I'm flashing my chest at Irene.

1283
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:15,160
Stop getting Irene excited, it's really, it's really distracting.

1284
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,160
Anyways...

1285
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,360
Thank God we're not a TV show.

1286
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,360
Dream Lords on the PC, brand new MMO.

1287
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,440
And then finally, a GameStop exclusive, Chulip, when I gotta tell you this game looks like

1288
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,440
a...

1289
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,440
Wait, it's a GameStop exclusive?

1290
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,200
It's a GameStop exclusive, and it looks like a piece of doggy shit.

1291
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:38,040
Wait, I played this game at E3 like two years ago when it was first, it was cute, I mean,

1292
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,040
it isn't, is it $19.99?

1293
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,160
Because that might be okay.

1294
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,860
But yeah, I mean, it isn't gonna win any awards, but it was cute, I mean, you know what you're

1295
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,860
getting into, okay?

1296
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,360
It's a game called Chulip for Christ's sake.

1297
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,520
Yeah.

1298
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,520
It's a kissing simulator.

1299
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,520
Yeah, it's a kissing game.

1300
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,520
You go around, you kiss people.

1301
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Oh man, that's gonna...

1302
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,520
What?

1303
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,560
It's gonna, it's like a sexual harassment game.

1304
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,160
It's gonna sell really well amongst the nerds, because they'll need practice kissing, because

1305
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,920
they don't kiss anyone else, except for their moms.

1306
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,920
That's so wrong.

1307
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,720
No, um, no, Chulip is a $30 game.

1308
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,720
What?

1309
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,720
$29.99.

1310
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,720
Thank God.

1311
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,080
It'll be in the bargain bin in three weeks.

1312
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Come on.

1313
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,080
You know it and I know it.

1314
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,080
Come on.

1315
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,720
Is that it?

1316
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,720
That's it.

1317
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,360
Japanese games coming out on February 15th on the PlayStation 2.

1318
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,480
There's not a lot, actually, across the various systems.

1319
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,480
Nothing on 360 or any of that stuff, but we have on PlayStation 2 Appleseed EX is coming

1320
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,140
out from Sega.

1321
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:46,640
They also are putting on Castlevania Curse of Darkness to Konami best hits.

1322
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,880
I should also mention this game, Shining Force EXA is coming out.

1323
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,560
Also Soul Cradle, Sekai o Kuro Mano is coming out.

1324
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,560
I know.

1325
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,560
Shut up, Irene.

1326
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,560
I butchered every...

1327
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,760
That's why they have me do the Japanese release dates, because I can't pronounce any of them.

1328
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,760
That was awesome.

1329
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,760
Shut up.

1330
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,760
I hate you.

1331
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,760
Sumimasen.

1332
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:12,840
Zero no Suikaima is coming out as well from Marvelous Entertainment on the PlayStation

1333
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,920
2.

1334
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:20,120
Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Bleach DS 2nd is coming out, and this game sounds like it

1335
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,120
might be fun.

1336
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,120
Death Note, Kira Game.

1337
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,120
Yes.

1338
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,120
I want that.

1339
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,120
It's coming out.

1340
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,120
What the hell is Death Note?

1341
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,120
I don't even know.

1342
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,120
Death Note is awesome.

1343
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,120
What is it?

1344
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,120
It's awesome.

1345
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,120
Okay.

1346
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,120
Okay.

1347
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,120
Thanks, Jamie.

1348
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,120
They're really descriptive.

1349
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,120
Hey, hey, hey.

1350
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,120
I'm going to preorder that shit right now.

1351
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,120
So, shut up.

1352
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,680
Death Note is a manga done by the same one who did Hikaru no Go.

1353
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,360
It's really, really, really, really, really, really, really cool.

1354
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,520
They just did a movie, and they're working on a second movie, and the anime is out right

1355
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
now.

1356
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,920
It's super awesome.

1357
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,600
It's about a guy who finds the notebook of a death god and then starts killing people.

1358
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,040
And that's all I'm going to say, because everyone should be reading it.

1359
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:11,120
And if that's not your cup of tea, Luminous 2 is coming out on the PSP in Japan.

1360
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,160
I'm not sure what songs they got different than we did, but I know they have some other

1361
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,280
songs there instead.

1362
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,760
I think we read them on a previous episode, so you'll have to go back and look, because

1363
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,160
I'm feeling too lazy.

1364
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,920
But I do want to point out also on Sony PSP, Tales of Destiny 2.

1365
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,000
If you're a Tales of Destiny fan, there you have it.

1366
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Oh, Rob.

1367
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,160
Domo arigato for that news.

1368
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,160
Shut up.

1369
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:39,220
Well, actually, why don't you reserve your Domo arigato for Dark Sakura, because she

1370
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:44,400
is going to give you her website of the week, and it's the place on the internet that you

1371
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,280
should definitely be checking out right now.

1372
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,280
It's not mine to give.

1373
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,280
All right.

1374
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,720
Well, we do.

1375
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,920
It's the gift that keeps on giving here on Orange One's Radio.

1376
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,240
Someone's sick and deranged website.

1377
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,240
All right.

1378
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,020
Well, you've found it, and you're highlighting it here for us.

1379
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,840
So arigato, Dark Sakura.

1380
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:08,320
Isn't that what Scott over on All Games calls you, Dark Sakura?

1381
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,200
Dark, dark, ball Sakura.

1382
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,440
Hearts, love you.

1383
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,240
Are you done?

1384
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,240
Yes.

1385
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,960
And the site of the week.

1386
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,960
Shut up, Rob.

1387
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,960
Sorry.

1388
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,960
I love that site.

1389
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,960
Let me introduce this again.

1390
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,960
I'm sorry.

1391
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,280
Let me try this again here.

1392
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,280
No, no, no, no.

1393
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,280
Just fucking play the music.

1394
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,280
I'm talking.

1395
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,280
No, no, no, no.

1396
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,280
Today's website of the week.

1397
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,280
No, no, no.

1398
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,280
Hold on.

1399
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,280
No.

1400
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,280
We're going to give this a proper...

1401
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,280
Jamie's kicking Rob's ass.com.

1402
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,280
All right.

1403
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,280
I'm sorry for butchering your name.

1404
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,280
So here we go.

1405
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,280
We're going to give...

1406
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,280
Here we go.

1407
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,280
Ready?

1408
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,280
It's time for Dark Sakura's hardcore website of the week.

1409
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,280
Yeah.

1410
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:54,280
We should do that from now on.

1411
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:01,280
Today's website of the week is davidtennis.com.

1412
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,280
Dude, I want to look up the extra music again.

1413
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,280
As I said, today's website of the week is davidtennis.com because I couldn't think of

1414
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,280
anything else.

1415
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,280
Oh, never mind.

1416
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,280
So much for the hardcore.

1417
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,280
Meow, meow, meow.

1418
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
Meow, meow, meow.

1419
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,280
That would be david-tennis.com.

1420
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:25,520
He is the man who plays the 10th doctor on Doctor Who and I love him.

1421
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,520
That's all.

1422
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:30,280
I think we should just change this feature to Doctor Who website of the week.

1423
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,280
Yeah, the Doctor Who website of the week.

1424
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,280
Hey, I haven't done a Doctor Who site in like three months.

1425
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,280
I could bite my ass in a non-literal way.

1426
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,280
Yes, Rice Princess has a question.

1427
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,280
I do.

1428
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,280
Can I help you?

1429
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,280
Eddie wants to know.

1430
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,280
Yes.

1431
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,280
In any of the Lincoln...

1432
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,280
Well, it was just, what, Ocarina of Time and...

1433
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,280
No, no.

1434
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,280
What ended up being the only village in the land of Hyrule in the Zelda games, Irene and

1435
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,280
I pronounce it differently and we're going to start a debate.

1436
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,280
I pronounce it Kakariko Village and Irene pronounces it...

1437
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,280
Kakariko.

1438
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,280
Maybe Kakariko.

1439
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,280
And she's Asian so she's probably right.

1440
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,280
Kakapupi.

1441
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,280
Kakapupi Village.

1442
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,280
All of us Whitey's back in the 90s called it Kakariko Village.

1443
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,080
Yeah, but if you read the Kana in Japanese it has pretty much even pronunciation on every

1444
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,800
syllable it would be Kakariko.

1445
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,280
I didn't know the village had a name.

1446
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,280
Are you serious?

1447
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,280
Like the village...

1448
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,280
That's exactly what I was going to say.

1449
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,280
It's the village that has the chickens that you beat up that all attack you.

1450
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,280
That's a really long title for it.

1451
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,280
I mean, it is the village.

1452
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,280
That's what Kakariko means.

1453
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,280
It means town of chickens.

1454
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,280
Town of chickens.

1455
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,280
The town of avenging chickens.

1456
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:46,480
Anyways, speaking of avenging chickens, we have a brand new program that's being started

1457
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:53,280
by Microsoft and kind of teaming up with Old Spice Deodorant to...

1458
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,280
No, I'm sorry, this is really funny because you know that stereotype.

1459
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,280
Any other game would be uncivilized.

1460
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,280
No, but you know like the gamer that's been sitting at home all day racking up these 10,000...

1461
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,280
I'm sorry.

1462
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,280
Finish your story.

1463
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
I apologize for interrupting.

1464
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,280
Any who.

1465
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,280
Then I'll make my deodorant joke.

1466
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:18,600
They're basically challenging Xbox Live users who are in America to add at least 1,500 achievement

1467
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,640
points to their gamer score between February 12th and April 12th.

1468
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,960
And depending on what your gamer score is now, starting off, that will depend on what

1469
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,240
prize package you win.

1470
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,880
And here are the different prize packages for you that you could possibly earn by wasting

1471
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,680
this much time.

1472
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:45,720
If your gamer score is 0 to 4,999, you can earn a game picture, a dashboard theme, and

1473
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,920
Contra for Xbox Live Arcade.

1474
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,220
That's level 1.

1475
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:58,280
Level 2, which is between 5,000 and 9,999 gamer points, you receive everything from

1476
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,680
the level 1 package as well as 100 Microsoft points and a contest t-shirt.

1477
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,680
Oh my god!

1478
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,680
That's awesome!

1479
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,680
Dude!

1480
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,680
Dude!

1481
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,680
I love your shirt!

1482
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,680
Dude!

1483
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:19,180
Any who, if you have over 10,000 gamer points, you will earn the level 1 package, 200 Microsoft

1484
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,960
points, a t-shirt, and Fusion Frenzy 2.

1485
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,960
Oh my god!

1486
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,960
A t-shirt!

1487
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,960
Dude!

1488
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,960
Dude!

1489
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,960
Dude, I gotta get that t-shirt!

1490
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
That game fucking sucks!

1491
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,080
But I gotta get the t-shirt!

1492
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,800
And by the way, we here at Orange Launch Radio are excited to announce that there's actually

1493
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:41,000
some secret levels that have not yet been unveiled, but here's the deal.

1494
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,140
If you have 20,000 gamer points or more, you're in level 4, and Old Spice will actually send

1495
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:53,360
you free deodorant, because you probably need it if your gamerscore has gotten to be that

1496
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,360
high.

1497
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,360
Actually, I'm not gonna include it in every level, because all of this stinks, so...

1498
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,680
They're like, no, no, no, we don't care about the prizes, we really just want to get the

1499
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,360
deodorant to you and we're masking it with the prizes.

1500
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:08,440
And if your gamerscore is 50,000 or above, you're on level 5, and Old Spice is going

1501
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:13,920
to send you a free blow-up doll, because you probably need one of those as well.

1502
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,520
But you know what, the best prize is in level 6, they actually send someone to punch you

1503
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,760
in the gob.

1504
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,760
QQ!

1505
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:36,280
But if you, to enter this wonderful contest, just simply go to xbox.com slash rewards,

1506
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:43,440
and you can enter after, well basically after the 12th, so hurry up and get those 1500 achievement

1507
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,240
points so you can score that wonderful Fusion Frenzy 2, hooray!

1508
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,320
Travis Donovan from our Saturday Night Program here at Orange Lounge says, worst product

1509
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,760
tie-in promo ever.

1510
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:00,080
Black Wolf from the other Sunday Night Program on the other network, allgames.com says, level

1511
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:05,320
3 package equals 830 point value plus t-shirt plus Bill Gates' favorite game.

1512
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,000
Oh my god, Fusion Frenzy 2 is Bill Gates' favorite game?

1513
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
What a loser!

1514
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,320
That's probably the only game he's played this year.

1515
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:17,560
He's like, that's my favorite game.

1516
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,280
Mystic Goan says, I'm so tired of hearing, wow, you play so much, your stink is going

1517
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,280
through the mic.

1518
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,320
Thanks, Old Spice!

1519
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,800
QQ!

1520
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:33,800
Anyhow, something else that is going to cause people to not leave the house for today, actually

1521
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,920
I should ask real quick, are you going to participate in this, Loki?

1522
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,340
Fuck no, Fusion Frenzy 2?

1523
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,840
No, but you're not at that level, your gamer score is not 10,000.

1524
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,840
T-shirt?

1525
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,840
I know, free t-shirt.

1526
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,840
Oh, t-shirt.

1527
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,840
Something to work out.

1528
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,720
I'm going to be doing Crackdown, so if I finish Crackdown that quick, I guess.

1529
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,080
DDR Universe is going to be an easy 1,000 points.

1530
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,080
DDR Universe, yeah.

1531
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,080
All right.

1532
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,080
Cookie Party.

1533
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,080
Anyhow, what?

1534
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,080
Cookie Party?

1535
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,080
What?

1536
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,080
Cookie Party.

1537
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,080
You eat a Cookie Party t-shirt?

1538
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,280
Fuck yeah, I would be renting, I'd be going to Blockbuster right now to rent like frickin'

1539
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,440
NBA Live 06 or whatever those games are, I don't play, but I have the easiest gamer

1540
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,440
scores in the world.

1541
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,320
They give away a Cookie Party t-shirt, I'm all about that, and if you don't understand

1542
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,320
the joke, that's too bad.

1543
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,160
The Halo 3 beta invite.

1544
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,240
Halo 3 beta invites the picture that are included with Crackdown, like the little slip that

1545
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:28,400
comes in has been leaked out to the internet, and here's the catch about the Halo 3 beta,

1546
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,540
you have to have the Crackdown disc to be able to play the Halo 3 beta, so no buying

1547
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,640
the game, taking the slip out for the Halo 3 thing, and then selling the game back.

1548
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,080
You actually have to hang onto the game, probably past the return window, to actually play the

1549
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,160
Halo 3 beta online.

1550
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:51,200
Just another thing too, the Halo 3 beta might not be available right as you pick up Crackdown.

1551
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,520
I hope nobody's expecting that, it's not going to be.

1552
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,920
I hope people don't think that's what's going to happen.

1553
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,680
It just means that you're going to get into the beta whenever it's available.

1554
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:09,040
Is that a subtle way for them to let people know that they're cracking down on that returning

1555
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,040
thing?

1556
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,960
Okay, I ruined that joke.

1557
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,320
Say goodbye to Rice Princess, everyone.

1558
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,320
It's the last show.

1559
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,760
It's nice knowing you, Rice Princess.

1560
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,760
Thanks for playing.

1561
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,760
You lose.

1562
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,760
Ball failed.

1563
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:24,760
Well, in other gaming news, there is a particular little game that a lot of people were sort

1564
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,520
of obsessed of that didn't go so well in Japan called Loco Roco.

1565
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,920
Well, the sequel is now playable.

1566
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:42,720
You can go actually onto the website and there is a downloadable version.

1567
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,720
Did you download it?

1568
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,720
Not yet.

1569
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,720
Are you going to?

1570
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,720
I haven't been home.

1571
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,720
I see.

1572
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,720
She got her hair did this weekend.

1573
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,720
I got my hair did.

1574
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,720
Yeah.

1575
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:56,720
Now, there also is though a little bit of a rumor stating that it could be possible

1576
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,680
this will be a PS3 version, but honestly, I'm really thinking that it should just stay

1577
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:08,460
PSP because that type of game really lends itself well to the PSP, especially since you're

1578
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:14,320
turning the six success is not going to be as much fun as the system itself or rocking

1579
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,800
the system itself.

1580
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:21,160
Yeah, I'm hoping it'll go on PSP as well because PSP, actually, PSP is having a little bit

1581
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,920
of a resurgence with the Castlevania and some of these other games that are coming out.

1582
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,200
It's importable ops and all these Konami's support behind PSP.

1583
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,840
It's actually becoming more and more like a system people ought to be checking out,

1584
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,040
especially if a price cut isn't.

1585
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,040
I bought another PSP.

1586
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,040
Did you?

1587
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,040
Yeah.

1588
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,040
Good job.

1589
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,040
I bought it off of a friend.

1590
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,040
What's this?

1591
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,040
Your fourth?

1592
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,040
Well, I only have two now.

1593
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,040
Only?

1594
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,040
Yeah.

1595
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,960
Well, basically, this one is going to be... I'm going to put the Dark Alex firmware on there

1596
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:51,960
now.

1597
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:58,640
It's because my friend, he mistreats his PSP, so he broke the buttons and the analog sticks,

1598
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,720
so I have to fix that, but I bought it for three bucks.

1599
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,920
By the way, if you're listening to us on a PSP, you should visit OLRPSP.com.

1600
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,120
Loki hasn't updated it in about a year, but it's still pretty, and there's a background

1601
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,120
that you can download.

1602
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,120
There will be new stuff eventually.

1603
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,120
Sure, there will.

1604
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,120
And I'm working on stuff.

1605
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,360
Right after you finish the Wii website, too, right?

1606
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,760
Actually, that has to do with the OLR PSP.

1607
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,760
Oh, wheely.

1608
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,760
Wow.

1609
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,760
That's lame.

1610
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,760
Anyways.

1611
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,000
It's better than OPSP, really.

1612
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,760
Some cool stuff, though, that you might be able to do in the future will include Skype,

1613
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:40,760
because apparently, speaking of the new firmwares coming out, they have dissected the firmware,

1614
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:49,400
and they have found a little line of code here in 311 that talks about the Skype plug-in,

1615
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,960
so it's something that will be coming out possibly later on.

1616
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,160
But that's kind of cool, though.

1617
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,440
So Skype support coming soon to your PSP.

1618
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,440
How is that going to work?

1619
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,440
That's special.

1620
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,960
Because there's no microphone on it.

1621
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,640
Well, they have headsets for it.

1622
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,280
You can use headsets for...

1623
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,920
What ever happened to the DS thing that was like Skype?

1624
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,800
Remember when they showed that at E3?

1625
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,080
Like they had the white Wi-Fi voice thing?

1626
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,080
Voice over IP?

1627
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,080
Yeah.

1628
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,640
Just like they have in Metroid Prime Hunter.

1629
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,600
Oh, they put it in one game, Big Wow.

1630
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:23,800
Actually, no, they have it in the new Diddy Kong Racing.

1631
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,360
I think you're missing my point.

1632
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:30,200
My point is, where is the standalone app where I can use this to call my friends across the

1633
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,200
US for free?

1634
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:36,520
Rob, now, if they had a standalone app, that would mean that they're embracing online.

1635
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,840
They don't want to let everyone know that they're embracing online.

1636
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,840
It's a secret.

1637
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,940
Oh, because they haven't actually embraced online.

1638
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,480
They're actually making the internet harder, is what Nintendo does.

1639
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,480
You don't understand, Rob.

1640
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,480
You don't understand.

1641
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,480
Wii Connect 24.

1642
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,480
It's connected all the time.

1643
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,040
That means it's connected to something out there.

1644
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,960
Something that makes my Wii glow.

1645
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,520
But when I turn it on to see what that something is, there's nothing there.

1646
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,960
But shortly after I turned it on, there's stuff there.

1647
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,120
It's just it lets me know soon there will be more stuff there.

1648
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,300
Wake me up when the Wii downloads my porn for me.

1649
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,300
What the fuck is...

1650
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,680
Honestly, and I hate to go on a rant about it again, but what the fuck is up with Wii

1651
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,680
Connect 24?

1652
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,680
It doesn't download my messages.

1653
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,080
I don't have current weather.

1654
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,600
I don't have current news.

1655
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,480
It doesn't download any updates.

1656
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,280
What the fuck is it doing?

1657
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,120
Is your Wii on?

1658
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,560
Yes, my Wii is on.

1659
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,920
No, no, it's devil power making it glow.

1660
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,200
You should be a Nintendo customer service rabbi.

1661
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,920
Oh yeah, because I've had the total opposite experience.

1662
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,760
My Wii starts glowing, I turn it on, and there's messages right there.

1663
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,440
All the updates are downloaded without me having to do anything, so I don't know what

1664
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,440
you're doing.

1665
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,440
It's because you're like the biggest...

1666
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,720
No, but don't you have to click in and actually do the update manually, right?

1667
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,720
You still have to click the...

1668
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,720
Yeah, I just had to do that.

1669
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,720
What?

1670
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,720
I've never had to do that.

1671
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,720
Okay.

1672
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,000
Do you have the news channel on your Wii right now?

1673
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I do.

1674
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,220
Yeah, when there's a new server, because they're not just going to do that without you wanting

1675
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,220
to do it.

1676
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,360
But the messages are there.

1677
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,960
The updates have like...

1678
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,660
Yeah, it'll tell you right away.

1679
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,660
That was the thing.

1680
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,880
The thing about the 24s was to do all that shit without you having to think about it,

1681
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,880
right?

1682
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,600
Not the extra apps though, because you have to choose what apps you want.

1683
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,080
Like I'd be kind of mad if I wanted, and I was like, I don't want that app, and it was

1684
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,080
on there, you know?

1685
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,760
But like the messages, I don't have to download them.

1686
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,900
They're already there when I turn it on.

1687
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:30,760
You do realize that those downloading apps that you so call, those are actually firmware

1688
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,760
updates.

1689
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,040
The apps were meant to be on the system, and all you're doing is updating the firmware.

1690
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:39,740
So yes, you are having to download the updates it's not doing for you automatically.

1691
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,760
It's not downloading the programs, say like the internet browser, that you actually had

1692
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,760
to download.

1693
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,760
Yeah!

1694
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,480
But what if you don't want the internet browser?

1695
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,480
Too bad!

1696
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,480
Then don't download it!

1697
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,480
Oh, why?

1698
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,420
The internet browser you don't have to download, it's news and weather.

1699
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,920
You need your news and weather.

1700
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,360
Oh yeah, I really need that really bad.

1701
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,000
I would like to take a quick poll of all the Wii owners in the room.

1702
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,120
How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?

1703
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,160
How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?

1704
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,360
I will go first.

1705
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,140
I've used the forecast channel twice, and the news channel three times.

1706
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:17,920
And once was this week because I was looking for pictures of Anna Nicole Smith.

1707
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,000
Loki.

1708
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,120
I used the forecast channel once today, but it had weather from midnight, which said it

1709
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:28,800
was still raining, yet outside it's blurring sun, so apparently that was wrong.

1710
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,360
And Loki went outside in a huge park going, man, fuck the Wii!

1711
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,240
I just wanted to know if it was raining later, but I'd have to go in and...

1712
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,920
How about you open a window, dumbass, that's going to tell you if it's raining or not.

1713
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,600
Well, I know if it's raining now, I want to know if it's raining later, hence the forecast.

1714
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,240
I don't want to know what it's doing now, I mean, because I can just look out a window.

1715
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,680
We can open it now, Kat.

1716
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
Exactly.

1717
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,800
I don't want to know what weather it was at midnight, oh great, it was raining while I

1718
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,800
was asleep.

1719
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,800
Excellent!

1720
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,800
That's great to know!

1721
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,360
In case I was outside when I was sleeping!

1722
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,360
So it...

1723
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,360
That's stupid.

1724
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,040
Well, the Sleepwalkers of America, thank you, you insensitive fuck.

1725
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,440
Well, they would know after the fact, they'd be like, what the fuck?

1726
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,440
It's raining!

1727
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,760
They're like, oh man, I have pneumonia, this sucks.

1728
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:17,120
DarkSakura, how many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?

1729
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,000
She's holding up a big fat zero.

1730
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Eddie?

1731
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,760
Just one time when I first got it.

1732
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,200
Dan just used it, though.

1733
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,240
Like every day?

1734
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,400
I just happened to be in the living room and he had it up while I was sleeping.

1735
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,400
Okay, so once.

1736
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,000
More than that, but I just thought once.

1737
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,080
I haven't used either before, but I use the foreskin channel a lot.

1738
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,480
It's my favorite one.

1739
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,880
Why are you on the... who invited you on tonight's program?

1740
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,880
Nobody did, did they?

1741
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,880
Me?

1742
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,880
That's what I thought.

1743
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,880
I invited myself.

1744
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,880
I remembered why you haven't been on this program in a while.

1745
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,000
Anyway, moving on to other news.

1746
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:57,680
News coming out of DICE, the DICE show, D-I-C-E, coming out of Las Vegas, the PSP and the PS3

1747
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,200
networks will be joining together.

1748
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:04,120
That was coming from Phil Harrison, quote, this year we'll be adding some functionality

1749
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,200
to the PSP that will unify our approach.

1750
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,520
So we really don't know what exactly that means yet.

1751
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:15,360
That means I don't have to buy a PlayStation 3 to download PlayStation 1 games to my PSP.

1752
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,440
If maybe that means that they'll have the same look and feel of the store or what's

1753
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,520
going on, but we don't really know.

1754
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:27,480
That means that the PlayStation Portable will actually have a network store, since it doesn't

1755
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,480
right now.

1756
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:32,560
That'll be kind of nice, because the Sony website isn't even that great on the PSP.

1757
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,560
I don't know if you've gotten to it.

1758
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,560
It's not that great.

1759
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:42,960
I try not to go to it, because it's lame.

1760
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,480
I'm reading comments in chatroom, by the way, who's given some feedback on the whole debate

1761
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,800
we were having in here.

1762
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,160
James Patrick says, forecast is good here in Texas, it told me it was going to rain

1763
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,160
a couple of times.

1764
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,160
Interesting.

1765
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,400
Burshad says, wait, we are gamers, we are in the basement, no windows.

1766
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,640
Oh, I forgot.

1767
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,640
Sorry about that.

1768
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,640
How could I forget?

1769
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,040
Oh, yeah, because we're on the second story.

1770
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,040
Anyhow.

1771
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:16,520
Well, I actually read an article last week about an HMV UK retailer who was doing a PSP

1772
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,760
PS3 bundle.

1773
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:24,720
They have retracted it now due to consumer pissed-offness.

1774
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,720
They've heard the people.

1775
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,720
Is that the legal term?

1776
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,220
Yes, pissed-offness.

1777
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:33,360
They have heard the people, they have gone back and said that for anyone who's participated

1778
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:39,480
in the pre-order, they will give them an option of just ordering the PS3 or get the bundle.

1779
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:48,560
The PS3 is going to cost £425 on the March 23 release in Europe with 220,000 units to

1780
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,760
be available on that day.

1781
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:57,240
But, yeah, if you're going through HMV, you can just order just the PS3 now, although

1782
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,240
I don't know why.

1783
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,720
There's only one good game on it.

1784
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,240
So they did this in response to customer demand?

1785
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,240
Pretty much.

1786
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,920
So the tribe has spoken?

1787
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,160
The PMS of the masses have spoken.

1788
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,160
I see.

1789
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,160
All right.

1790
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,220
Well, there's some other news that came out of DICE this week as well, featuring some

1791
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:21,440
wonderful announcements of stuff, including the PlayStation Ducks are back and their own

1792
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:27,200
game now called Super Rub-a-Dub, and apparently the game looks very similar to the arcade

1793
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,920
game Bubbles, which is kind of interesting.

1794
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:36,960
You tilt the screen around, moving the mother duck to collect the baby ducks and reach the

1795
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,960
end.

1796
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:44,000
Yeah, that will be coming sometime soon, I guess.

1797
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,720
And then, of course, they were talking about SingStar for the PlayStation 3 and how the

1798
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:55,560
PlayStation Store will be supporting that as well.

1799
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,280
So that's not a big surprise.

1800
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,560
And of course, also talking about how people will be able to create their own custom user

1801
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,040
pages, including video performances of them singing.

1802
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:13,680
I assume that you would need the eye toy for this, or the EYE OF JUDGEMENT, or whatever.

1803
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,880
And then, of course, they were talking about- Will Simon Cowell be a part of the Eye of

1804
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,880
Judgment?

1805
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,880
I thought it was awful.

1806
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,240
No, they will not.

1807
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,560
I think you should take a gun and shoot yourself in the face.

1808
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,240
And then finally, the PlayStation 3 online platform will continue to evolve aggressively.

1809
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:32,920
Well, that's great, because one game, or less than one game a month, kind of sucks

1810
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,880
right now with your PlayStation online store.

1811
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,000
I know people bitch about no updates to the Xbox 360s market, but jeez.

1812
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,440
Yeah, at least Xbox 360s gains stuff on a weekly basis, at least.

1813
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:50,160
I have yet to see some new demos come to the PlayStation 3 store.

1814
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,240
But it's early for PlayStation.

1815
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,160
Xbox was slow in the beginning as well.

1816
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,800
Yeah, I remember that, but still though, come on.

1817
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,840
I don't want to see an update- Oh, there's new stuff on the PlayStation Store!

1818
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:05,200
It's a new PS1 game that you can't play on the PS3, you need to play it on your PSP.

1819
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,200
Well, fuck you.

1820
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,480
Raven's Dolphin says, Loki, I think the duck is a joke I do not know.

1821
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,040
What's the duck joke?

1822
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:16,280
The duck they showed at every new console launch, it's like the tech demo that they

1823
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,280
had.

1824
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:23,880
Oh, the way they build a tub with the rubber ducks to do how many on-screen polygons.

1825
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:30,400
That was on the very first disc, the PS position demo disc.

1826
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,840
Well speaking of PlayStation, at least the portable types, they're going to get you in

1827
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,800
trouble in New York City pretty soon.

1828
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,200
But don't worry, Sony fanboys, Nintendo DS is a fair game as well.

1829
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:44,640
This is the reason, three pedestrians have been killed in Brooklyn since September because

1830
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:50,200
they step into the road while using an electronic device and it distracts them from people yelling,

1831
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,200
watch out!

1832
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,320
You know, hey, get out of the way, there's a car coming.

1833
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:58,020
And what they're thinking about doing now is that they're going to pass a law that says,

1834
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:02,160
it's legislation, it hasn't been passed yet, but it's on the table, about you could be

1835
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:08,240
charged a $100 fine if you're using a PSP, a Nintendo DS, an iPod, a Blackberry, or a

1836
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,960
mobile phone, all while crossing the road.

1837
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,880
So I think it's dangerous to use a device and walk.

1838
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,120
What about people driving?

1839
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,080
Oh, it's dangerous too, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1840
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,160
Well, she is illegal there too, isn't it?

1841
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:26,080
But well, yeah, I mean, that's already illegal in New York City, but you have to remember

1842
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,080
the very...

1843
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,080
It's illegal here too, Rob.

1844
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:32,200
Well, not yet, but it almost is, but keep this in mind is that...

1845
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,600
I switched to speakerphone anyway.

1846
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,800
Back off, lady.

1847
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,700
The thing you have to remember too, in New York City, hello, it's unlike any other city

1848
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:40,700
when you're talking about pedestrians.

1849
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,280
I mean, there's so freaking many pedestrians.

1850
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,440
So it really is kind of its own unique little world.

1851
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,440
You know what?

1852
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,440
They make the laws for a reason.

1853
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,400
They're trying to protect people, not inhibit what they're doing.

1854
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,680
Apparently it takes a few retarded people stepping out in the traffic, jaywalking while

1855
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,600
talking on their cell phone or playing a fucking game.

1856
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,000
Who would the fucking play a game and walk in the first place is what I want to know,

1857
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
but whatever.

1858
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So they're doing it.

1859
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,320
Some of our New York City living friends chime in on this in the chat.

1860
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,580
Rama says, Sky, some people are too stupid to pay attention.

1861
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:15,520
You do not turn the volume up to the point where you cannot hear a honking horn.

1862
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:19,040
Legend of Zaku says, looks like this guy hasn't heard about natural selection.

1863
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,040
Amen to that.

1864
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,080
What do you guys think about this law?

1865
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,760
Is this a needed law, a necessity?

1866
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:33,000
I think that Darwinism should just be let work because that would cleanse the gene pool.

1867
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Wow.

1868
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,180
All right.

1869
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:39,440
I think we have to blame Grand Theft Auto for this because in Grand Theft Auto you run

1870
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,440
over people.

1871
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,960
So therefore Grand Theft Auto is to blame because these people are getting run over

1872
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,000
by cars.

1873
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,480
It makes perfect sense.

1874
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,240
Where is the justice with these damn M-rated games?

1875
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:53,740
We need to take them off the shelves because clearly it's not incompetent people that are

1876
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,240
causing deaths.

1877
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,240
It is these M-rated games.

1878
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:03,960
How do they know that the drivers aren't playing their PSPs while they're driving?

1879
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,200
Like maybe it's their fault.

1880
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,560
Maybe the driver is playing driver.

1881
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:11,720
Yeah, and then a car just falls right in front of them out of the sky.

1882
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,840
I just got punched in the face by a gay man.

1883
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,080
I think it's kind of a silly piece of legislation right there.

1884
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,080
But that's just me.

1885
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,080
I live in New York.

1886
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,080
I don't know.

1887
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:25,200
But seriously, I think that if you're stupid enough to not pay attention when you're crossing

1888
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,880
the road, you pretty much have it coming.

1889
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:34,440
I think it's one thing, if it was like a little kid who wasn't old enough to have the common

1890
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,440
sense.

1891
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,280
Well, the parents should be there to tell them to look out.

1892
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,280
Exactly.

1893
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,640
Well, okay, but if they're walking home from school, but then again the parents should

1894
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,960
still tell them in advance.

1895
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:48,480
They should teach them to look both ways before crossing the street, cross walks, and freaking

1896
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,920
pay attention because people are stupid.

1897
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,080
The drivers aren't going to pay any more attention than they are.

1898
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:59,080
If I'm crossing the road, hell yeah, I'm going to look and make sure that nobody's coming

1899
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,080
for me.

1900
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:06,640
I think that if you think that your video game is more important than your life, by

1901
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:12,360
all means play your game and spare the rest of us your DNA.

1902
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:17,640
I was thinking they shouldn't pass that so that people can still be getting hit by cars

1903
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,560
while they're doing that, and then I can just run over and take their PSP while they're

1904
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,000
on the ground, dying, and I'm like, yes, I have a PSP now.

1905
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Oh, you're so sympathetic.

1906
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I know.

1907
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I would totally do that.

1908
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Yeah, me too.

1909
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
It's like you're stupid.

1910
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
You don't deserve one of these.

1911
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,480
Well, I sense the angst rising in this room, and you know what happens when the angst rises?

1912
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,480
People die.

1913
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:49,360
It's time for the FUs of the week here, boys and girls.

1914
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,360
I love the FUs of the week.

1915
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,040
Dark soccer, then start us off.

1916
01:20:54,040 --> 01:21:01,760
A big FU to the medical industry for being more interested in selling us drugs than actually

1917
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:11,760
fixing the problem, because they give you all these drugs that do nothing but treat

1918
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:18,240
the symptoms or suppress the symptoms that your body creates to help you heal, and making

1919
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:23,720
us more and more and more and more dependent on them, when I think it's one thing that

1920
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:28,920
if you say have diabetes and need insulin, that's one thing.

1921
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:38,080
That's chronic condition, but if you have the flu and think, oh my God, I need to take

1922
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,720
this drug and this drug and this drug and this drug, when all you have to do is drink

1923
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:47,440
some tea, take some vitamin C, and take some time off work and sleep, you don't need to

1924
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:53,580
pay the whole reason that the medical field is so fucked up right now, because people

1925
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:57,040
are too dependent on treating symptoms.

1926
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:03,640
I've learned so much since going into massage therapy about how the body works.

1927
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:08,200
And also, if you're stressed out, take some fucking time and breathe.

1928
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:12,120
You're dumping adrenaline and other toxins into your liver, you are making yourself fucking

1929
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,840
sick, just stop and breathe.

1930
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,360
I'm done.

1931
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,840
Low key.

1932
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:23,560
Shut up, Fireballa, fuck you, and it'll give happy endings.

1933
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,120
If you want to join our chat room, you too can get yelled at by Dr. Stalker.

1934
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:34,500
I'd like to make an epi to the highway patrol in California, because I saw them speeding

1935
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,960
and not changing lanes using their blinker.

1936
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,080
One of them did that, so props to him, but the other fucking guy, what kind of example

1937
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,040
are you setting for these other drivers out there?

1938
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,680
No wonder they're driving like assholes, because you drive like an asshole too, and they think

1939
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:53,000
it's okay because the lawman's driving, you know, I don't give a shit if you can do that,

1940
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
whatever.

1941
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,480
So fuck that, and yeah, that's all I got.

1942
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,960
I'm not very angry today.

1943
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:08,880
Oh, yeah, fuck Activision for, you know, suing people over Guitar Hero, the completely original

1944
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,920
guitar game out there.

1945
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:17,240
My FU of the week goes to my doctor for not being available when I meet her, and to the

1946
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:21,680
dentist for my temporary crown falling out a second time.

1947
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,960
That's just lovely.

1948
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:24,960
Rice Princess, do you have any FUs?

1949
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:25,960
Any angst you'd like to get off your chest?

1950
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:26,960
Yeah, I wanted to say FUs, too, because you're playing this version of One Night Angel, and

1951
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:27,960
you should be playing the piano version.

1952
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:28,960
Hello?

1953
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:29,960
Jamie's Choice, not mine.

1954
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,960
Oh, okay.

1955
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,960
Well, you can play that one.

1956
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,960
This is more hardcore.

1957
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:40,600
Yeah, so it would be in honor of Eddie and I. I remember that one from our show.

1958
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,600
I do.

1959
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,600
And nobody else does.

1960
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
Yeah, that's okay.

1961
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Rice Princess.

1962
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
Well, then we can refresh their memories by reenacting it on their own.

1963
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,600
I think I deleted that in P3.

1964
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,920
I think I'm gonna punch you.

1965
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,960
Eddie, any FUs of the week you want to give?

1966
01:23:53,960 --> 01:24:02,120
Yeah, I'm FUing whiny, immature, straight girls to steal, like, eyes from me, so, huh.

1967
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,120
Me too.

1968
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,120
Well.

1969
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,720
Stupid straight girl.

1970
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,720
Look out.

1971
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:11,400
That was a good comeback.

1972
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,960
Look out.

1973
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,560
You need a third eye for that one.

1974
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,560
Nobody understands that.

1975
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,560
I know.

1976
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,560
I know, because no one listens to The Wednesday Show.

1977
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,240
Anyhow, I think now's a very good time to take a break.

1978
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:27,080
I don't know about you kids, but I think now's a good break time.

1979
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,320
So we're gonna take a break right now.

1980
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,600
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1981
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:37,160
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1982
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,160
a week.

1983
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:51,160
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
