00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:26,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, February 11th, 2007, Xbox Gamerscore whores might get rewarded soon, an old DC gaming franchise is said to be coming back, and we have some exclusive news on the Alice movie.

2
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

3
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:42,393
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video gaming and gaming culture and what you, the gamer, really want to know.

5
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:43,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm here to help you through that.

6
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:44,874
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:45,754
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:48,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-hosts.

9
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:51,716
[SPEAKER_05]: In that corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:52,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Roar.

11
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:53,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Fresh off the highway.

12
00:00:53,868 --> 00:00:55,189
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:21,893
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, I want to apologize for my sound tonight because A, I'm recovering from a cold, so I sound a little bit congested.

14
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:30,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the plague, so I guess in 2007 this will be the year of Rob getting the plague instead of Jamie getting the plague all the time, so that's entertaining.

15
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:31,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Urgent care.

16
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:00,318
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

17
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:31,186
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like I'm talking out of a tin can, even though this microphone probably costs twice as much as Loki's microphone that he's using.

18
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:33,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Which the top is falling off of this microphone.

19
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:34,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's just lovely to hear.

20
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:36,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you'll have a tin can microphone soon, too.

21
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,671
[SPEAKER_08]: My microphone's working just fine.

22
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:40,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that, but that was donated to us.

23
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:41,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea where that microphone came from.

24
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:43,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I know who it came from.

25
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:46,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where it came from, but I mean, I know who donated it.

26
00:02:46,777 --> 00:02:47,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I know where to get them.

27
00:02:47,698 --> 00:02:47,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

28
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:49,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we need two more like that.

29
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Center.

30
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Then that's where we're going.

32
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:52,381
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going shopping.

33
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:53,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Any place that sells microphones.

34
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:54,923
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going shopping.

35
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,689
[SPEAKER_05]: No, dude, I got this at Radio Shack.

36
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, Radio Shack, you know, they have like 10 different microphones.

37
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, radio crap.

38
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, this microphone, I don't want to tell you how much it was, but I'll say it was twice as much as that one, and it has the tin can sound to it.

39
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:09,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

40
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:11,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it just takes some getting used to.

41
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:13,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put it up to your neck and go, hello.

42
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:15,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

43
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:16,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

44
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:20,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I was being told secrets from Jamie, so maybe we will get a shopping spree next week.

45
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:20,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

46
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, are you saying I should do this, Loki?

47
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:22,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie,

48
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:52,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, that's me.

49
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie, have you ever been on this show before, Eddie?

50
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:55,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like three or four years ago.

51
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Big, fruity, gay Eddie.

52
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Casper the gay, that's me.

53
00:03:59,057 --> 00:03:59,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Casper the gay.

54
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:04,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie the Friendly Gay, what kind of games are you into since you've never been on the show before?

55
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:05,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Never been on the show before.

56
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:07,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least, you haven't been on here since we've been podcasting.

57
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:10,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you were on the show, we had like five people listening and we thought we were the shit.

58
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:12,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Including us in the room.

59
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:15,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, it was like the live studio audience was it.

60
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,508
[SPEAKER_05]: We were live performers.

61
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:19,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we have this whole like internet podcast, iPod thing, it's crazy.

62
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:20,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so what type of games are you into?

63
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:27,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy Adventure, yeah, I'm a diehard Nintendo fanboy, which everybody, I guess is not as bad anymore because Wii's pretty cool, but yep.

64
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy Adventure, kind of games like Zelda.

65
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:31,537
[SPEAKER_05]: RPGs.

66
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:34,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Was Zelda like your favorite game that came out last year, you'd say?

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Twilight Princess by far.

68
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:38,143
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you say is your favorite video game of all time?

69
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:39,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so we have something to go off of here.

70
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:40,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Of all time?

71
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:42,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably like Link to the Past, something like that.

72
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're a total Link fanboy.

73
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:45,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd.

74
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd.

75
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:47,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerdy nerd.

76
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:47,932
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

77
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:51,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Casper the Gay, do you follow gaming news a lot?

78
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:53,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you follow the gaming culture?

79
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:55,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I log on to the IGN sometimes.

80
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

81
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

82
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:58,135
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't log on to those big money sites, though.

83
00:04:58,156 --> 00:04:58,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know, I know.

84
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:03,957
[SPEAKER_10]: The correct answer is, I read independent blogs like Destructoid and Kotaku.

85
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:04,937
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

86
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:05,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever Rob said.

87
00:05:08,278 --> 00:05:11,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll go to Orange Lounge Radio for all my news and awgames.com.

88
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,439
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the shit.

89
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:13,099
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

90
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:13,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, Eddie.

91
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good.

92
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:15,860
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I sound like.

93
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,200
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, no.

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you know, as far as the big box... Why is Eddie Mr. Bill?

96
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:20,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

97
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,081
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as...

98
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:25,882
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the big box sites go, IGN doesn't bug me nearly as bad as some of the others.

99
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:26,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

100
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:29,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's see.

101
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:34,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm reading chat room because we also have the chat room is always here to lend their perspective as well.

102
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:35,290
[SPEAKER_05]: We love our chat room.

103
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:36,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

104
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:37,192
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we have here?

105
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:39,173
[SPEAKER_05]: JV Mon says, Yay, Rice Princess.

106
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:42,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Knight says, What is up, our home girl?

107
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:45,058
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't even say it right, Ron.

108
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing very good.

109
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,680
[SPEAKER_09]: How about you?

110
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:48,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

111
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:49,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

112
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:52,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, isn't every gay person friendly?

113
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:53,156
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

114
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:53,896
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

115
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:57,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I've dated some real bitches in the past.

116
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,156
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

117
00:05:58,717 --> 00:05:59,617
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

118
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:02,677
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we could name some on this program, but we're above that.

119
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:03,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not.

120
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:04,438
[SPEAKER_05]: All of you.

121
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,998
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just kidding.

122
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:11,659
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm going to say, if you like to listen to the live shows on Orange Lingerie, because, you know, we don't just do this podcast.

123
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,779
[SPEAKER_05]: We have live shows there as well.

124
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday happens to be Guys on the Show, and it's our Valentine's Day special.

125
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:21,222
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be calling some of our exes on air.

126
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:22,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

127
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And wishing them a happy Valentine's Day, so that'll be a good time.

128
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:29,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's see.

129
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:33,330
[SPEAKER_05]: JV Mon says, I am gay and I am far from friendly.

130
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:34,751
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I met JV Mon in person.

131
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:35,352
[SPEAKER_05]: He was just shy.

132
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:36,012
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a little quiet.

133
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:37,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's gay.

134
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:38,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

135
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,060
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

136
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:09,796
[SPEAKER_09]: TV?

137
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

138
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:12,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you don't watch, so that's why I'm sharing this with you.

139
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:13,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even have cable, Rob.

140
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:14,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but okay.

141
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:16,379
[SPEAKER_08]: The extent of my cable is Court TV.

142
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you familiar with Lifetime, Vagina Television?

143
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:19,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you familiar with Lifetime?

144
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

145
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Television?

146
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't watched Lifetime in easily three years.

147
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:24,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

148
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Lifetime is like women's TV and like, you know, all the... That's why I don't watch it.

149
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:28,743
[SPEAKER_08]: It's stupid.

150
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:31,424
[SPEAKER_05]: The movies they have on there are like the best movies ever.

151
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,124
[SPEAKER_05]: They have like, you know...

152
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:38,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Justice, the story of the woman who stood in line at Walmart for a PS3.

153
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:44,271
[SPEAKER_05]: The story of the woman who was horribly raped and murdered and had a Lifetime movie made out of her.

154
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:44,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And had ear mites.

155
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I freaking love Lifetime movies.

156
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the most recent one.

157
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:50,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I should pick up a Lifetime movie.

158
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be a Lifetime movie.

159
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:51,976
[SPEAKER_08]: No way.

160
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:54,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Sakura, the gamer girl of the millennia.

161
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:55,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

162
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:59,260
[SPEAKER_05]: The Fantasia Barino story was one I just recently watched.

163
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,441
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, my point is, there's commercials...

164
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:05,483
[SPEAKER_05]: for this new show they're doing, Gay, Straight, or Taken.

165
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:13,525
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dating show, and the thing is that a woman goes out on a date with a gay man, a straight man, and a guy who's already married or taken, has a girlfriend.

166
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:16,987
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end is when she finds it.

167
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:24,629
[SPEAKER_05]: She has to pick which one's which, and if she correctly picks the straight man, then they win a fabulous date prize, like Hawaii type thing.

168
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,170
[SPEAKER_05]: But if she picks one of the others, then they win a prize, and she gets nothing.

169
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because whiny straight girls have it so hard.

170
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:32,445
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

171
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this something you would watch?

172
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:35,133
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

173
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:37,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell no!

174
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:41,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a video game that would appeal to gamer girls?

175
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:47,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know there's always that thing going around like, how do we get women into gaming?

176
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got two women in here.

177
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:52,035
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we get women into gaming?

178
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:57,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we need lifetime to bring out the video voyeur, the Susan Wilson video game?

179
00:08:57,657 --> 00:08:59,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what we need?

180
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:04,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm having a terrible hair day.

181
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Video games need more violence.

182
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,144
[SPEAKER_05]: is that how to get women into gaming?

183
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:23,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to see more titties in games definitely wait a minute we need boobs and blood more guy on guy spanking wait, wait, wait I'm done with that it's all about Dead or Alive Extreme and Rumble Roses

184
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,767
[SPEAKER_08]: and Rule of Roses Candy.

185
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:37,688
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about sequels to the Desperate Housewives PC game.

186
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:43,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if there's a skill that's vastly needed in this world, it's cooking and cleaning.

187
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, going to the chat room for some comments.

188
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Jared J says, Rob, you just crossed from respectable gay to stereotypical uber gay.

189
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:52,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, girlfriend, whatever.

190
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:53,332
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know me.

191
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:54,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Sit down.

192
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, snap, girl.

193
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:57,813
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so not me.

194
00:09:58,053 --> 00:09:58,793
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so not me.

195
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

196
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:00,013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really not...

197
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,935
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so not you when you're sober.

198
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:04,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, when I'm drunk, maybe.

199
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:05,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

200
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:07,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Nerd says, my parents watched it one day.

201
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty creepy.

202
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:11,364
[SPEAKER_05]: JV Mon says, I hate gay straight or taken.

203
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:12,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

204
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Padrino says, what if the taken guy is gay?

205
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:16,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

206
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:19,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, what if the taken guy is gay?

207
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:21,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was the gay guy that was taken on the show before.

208
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:23,170
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a straight guy that's taken.

209
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:28,456
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, here's the thing though, and even, we talked it over, like we were saying, what if, you know, we were put in that situation.

210
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:33,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, fuck that, just, you know, do whatever it takes to win the vacation, we'll forgive you.

211
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:35,844
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, that's, I don't know.

212
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:37,266
All you need to do is like,

213
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:38,905
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'll see you next time.

214
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:58,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Dead or Alive?

215
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,407
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole crap load of it.

216
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,148
[SPEAKER_08]: And, oh, I also play Twilight Zone.

217
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:41,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, though, we're fixing our Rocky and Bullwinkle machine, and we got an Earthshaker, which is old-school, cool pinball.

218
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:44,333
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you fitting any more pinball machines in there?

219
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:45,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually going to be selling some.

220
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:45,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

221
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:47,154
[SPEAKER_08]: We have nine pinball machines.

222
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, one of them's Will's.

223
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:54,137
[SPEAKER_08]: We sold him our Judge Dredd.

224
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:56,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to get rid of the Johnny Mnemonic.

225
00:11:56,557 --> 00:12:00,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I told Dan that if he gets rid of the Star Trek pinball, I would murder him in his sleep.

226
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're probably going to sell our Guns N' Roses machine.

227
00:12:04,118 --> 00:12:04,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's sad.

228
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:05,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that machine.

229
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:07,279
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe we'll then come over and play it before we sell it.

230
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:07,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to.

231
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I need money for Adolfis.

232
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:10,559
[SPEAKER_05]: After the show, okay.

233
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait.

234
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,040
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to charge me quarters?

235
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:14,780
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

236
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,721
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to sell them so that I can use the money from Dan's pinball machines.

237
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:21,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine.

238
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:25,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Canogram says, Oh, snap!

239
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:26,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocky and Bullwinkle.

240
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:27,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, snap.

241
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:36,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Rocky and Bullwinkle, but... Well, the problem with our Rocky and Bullwinkle machine is that we need a new board for it, for the ROM set.

242
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:39,426
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now the board's like, I'm going to be broken for a while.

243
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:45,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, paying for school, so I've got to decide what's more important, my education or pinball.

244
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is a really hard choice, but, you know.

245
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:50,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike W. says, Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

246
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,688
[SPEAKER_05]: CookieMama reference, of course.

247
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:55,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Insert Ellipse here.

248
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:57,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thanks, bye.

249
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,970
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to have SugarMama the game.

250
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:04,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I play that pretty often.

251
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:04,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

252
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:06,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

253
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:07,214
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week was good.

254
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I played more of the Crackdown demo, again.

255
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:12,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I found the grenade launcher, which makes the game a lot more fun.

256
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, what else did I do?

257
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a little bit of...

258
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh god, what the hell is that crappy PopCap game?

259
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:26,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's some crappy PopCap game that's on live.

260
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:28,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah.

261
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:31,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I'm just trying to get shooting points.

262
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:34,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got bored real quick, so.

263
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:36,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, let's see.

264
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Played more Resistance.

265
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:41,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually playing it the second time through.

266
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get some more weapons, so it's like mildly fun.

267
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:46,906
[SPEAKER_06]: More fun, I guess.

268
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:48,446
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

269
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,165
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

270
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,181
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

271
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,119
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

272
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,604
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just so retarded, so I have to play more Driver 3 now because I forgot how crappy that game is.

273
00:14:51,144 --> 00:15:00,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And probably now it's dirt cheap, so maybe pick up an actual copy of it instead of a pirated copy on my PlayStation 2 hard drive.

274
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And then play it on the PlayStation 3.

275
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:06,596
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that's pretty much it.

276
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:10,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to playing some new stuff this week, hopefully.

277
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Jared J says, oh god, I still can't believe I paid $50 for Driver 3 back in the day.

278
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:17,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

279
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:23,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe I paid $50 for a game I played a little bit this week, Fusion Frenzy 2.

280
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:29,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up this game because the demo was kind of fun, and I thought, oh, well, you know, I love those little mini-games.

281
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:30,589
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be, you know, a good time.

282
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:33,590
[SPEAKER_05]: The best way I can describe this game is unpolished.

283
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just, it feels sloppy.

284
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:40,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, all these little cutscenes are bleh, and the games all look the same, and it's so bland.

285
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:47,557
[SPEAKER_05]: How could a game with 40 mini-games that's basically Think Mario Party without the big board be so freaking bland?

286
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:48,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is.

287
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:48,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just so...

288
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:51,616
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

289
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:30,818
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics from F-Zero on GameCube And just like, you know, they keep looping the same animation Which is amazing because the developers are completely different Yeah, but yeah, to me it had the same look to it And it was just kind of generic And the characters are all the same, it's just they're different colors And they use the same animation loops over and over again Instead of actually having new cutscenes And it's just, yeah, I just think they rushed through it So I do not recommend Fusion Frenzy 2 Unless you want easy achievement points Go rent it because you can get through the achievements pretty easy As I understand it

290
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:36,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I racked up 75 pretty quickly just playing through it once and it wasn't anything that difficult, so yawn.

291
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:50,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we're going to talk later in the show about the rewards program, but for those of you guys that are hoping to get this as a reward, you might find that they're just trying to unload the extra copies they're bound to have because this game is not fun.

292
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

293
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:51,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing.

294
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:55,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God that the Halo beta wasn't included with this game.

295
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Root Beer Tapper Root Beer Tapper

296
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:29,976
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't see the other player on your screen at all.

297
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:35,740
[SPEAKER_05]: All you see is their score and how they're progressing in the game.

298
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:36,221
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

299
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:39,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't lend itself very much to a co-op.

300
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:42,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And they didn't even redo the graphics or anything.

301
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:47,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I guess it's good that it's only $5, which is the cheapest that Microsoft will charge any game.

302
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:55,196
[SPEAKER_05]: But expect this game to be the free toss-in on a lot of upcoming bundle stuff, like Xbox Live cards and things, because I just...

303
00:17:56,026 --> 00:18:02,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's... As much as I love Root Beer Tapper, it didn't get the same treatment a lot of the other games did.

304
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:04,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, I don't think it's as good of a value.

305
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:06,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And it pains me to say that.

306
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:07,977
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned that it's five bucks at the cheapest.

307
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,738
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it is on the Virtual Console and Nintendo.

308
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:10,539
[SPEAKER_04]: What is with that?

309
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to me, that's still kind of expensive for a game that came out like 20 years ago.

310
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:18,405
[SPEAKER_04]: They made their money on it, they're just selling the bits over the internet.

311
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,506
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of weird to me.

312
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:21,888
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people have been making the same complaints you have.

313
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:27,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Does a game like, I don't know, Tennis, and I'm not talking Wii Sports Tennis, I'm talking old school 8-bit Tennis.

314
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:31,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Does a game like Tennis really justify the same price as a game like Super Mario Bros.?

315
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:38,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when I can go buy a Nintendo for pretty cheap and buy the cartridges for like 50 cents or less.

316
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even if you want to go the illegal route, download the ROM, which...

317
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,901
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

318
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:12,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, comments from our chatroom.

319
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:17,518
[SPEAKER_05]: JeremyTodd1 says, I hate Root Beer Tapper, but of course I didn't play it a long time ago, so that nostalgia factor isn't there.

320
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:19,079
[SPEAKER_05]: But whatever, I still think the game sucks.

321
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Brad from PodCulture says, I've been playing the hell out of Root Beer Tapper.

322
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun times.

323
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:24,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So, differing opinions.

324
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:27,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess download the demo, see if it's something you like.

325
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:28,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

326
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:33,157
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a chatroom brawl breaking out over Root Beer Tapper.

327
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:36,501
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I think some Root Beer glasses have just been shattered.

328
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:38,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't it just be Tapper with the beer?

329
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:41,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was Budweiser and that was sponsored.

330
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:42,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you got product placement in there.

331
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:44,991
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like why you couldn't do Mike Tyson's Punch-Out now.

332
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:45,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

333
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:46,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Same type of thing.

334
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:48,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's because he bit people's ears off.

335
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,615
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why... Yeah, he's a cannibal.

336
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:55,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually, Nintendo is going to be re-skinning Punch-Out!!

337
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:02,824
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's going to be Mike Tyson's ear-biting and women-raping actually is going to be coming out to the Wii Virtual Console for only $5, Eddie!

338
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:04,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to play like Oonga Boonga.

339
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the Wiimote and just, like, thrust it in there.

340
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:12,951
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who don't know what Oonga Boonga is, just...

341
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:15,185
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the finger up the ass game.

342
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:16,407
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just don't research it.

343
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:17,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't look it up on Wikipedia.

344
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:18,769
[SPEAKER_08]: You should totally see it.

345
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:19,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, Loki.

346
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,012
[SPEAKER_05]: You can address those cards and letters to Loki at orangebonusradio.com.

347
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,375
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the finger up the ass for a tickets game.

348
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:28,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't we have ticket games like that over here?

349
00:20:28,537 --> 00:20:29,298
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be hilarious.

350
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:30,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

351
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:38,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go over and check in with Rice Princess and Casper the Gay and see if there's anything they've been playing this week real quick.

352
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:43,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing Ooga Booga, but, like, on my own body with someone else.

353
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:44,056
[SPEAKER_09]: You're disgusting.

354
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:45,797
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't dispense tickets.

355
00:20:45,897 --> 00:20:48,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just like, ooh, awesome.

356
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:49,498
[SPEAKER_05]: You're disgusting.

357
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:51,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie, what have you been playing this week?

358
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:54,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing Hot Sex.

359
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys drunk on this program tonight?

360
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,421
[SPEAKER_11]: They're high on life.

361
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:01,321
[SPEAKER_05]: They're wearing hats.

362
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is radio.

363
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:04,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can take some pictures and put them on the website.

364
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:05,042
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're wearing hats.

365
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:05,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like...

366
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:10,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Rice Princess is wearing a frickin' Shamrock hat, and it's like not even March yet.

367
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:15,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie, uh, Eddie, Casper the Game, what have you been playing?

368
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, big surprise, I downloaded, uh, Link the Bass when it came out on Virtual Console, but I was kinda mad, I was like, that was $8, I was like, holy crap.

369
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:21,854
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

370
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:46,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I forgot.

371
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:48,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing Super Mario World.

372
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:49,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I beat it.

373
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I beat Super Mario World because I'm awesome.

374
00:21:50,937 --> 00:21:51,817
[SPEAKER_04]: You beat it last night.

375
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I used Star World to get there quickly.

376
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Rob.

377
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I've beaten Super Mario World 2.

378
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:56,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Jamie.

379
00:21:56,702 --> 00:21:57,803
[SPEAKER_05]: About 10 years ago.

380
00:21:57,823 --> 00:21:58,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiss my ass.

381
00:21:59,425 --> 00:21:59,725
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

382
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:01,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Boonga boonga my ass?

383
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:02,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where that's been.

384
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:05,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll help you out there, Rob.

385
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:06,392
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are filthy.

386
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Explicit tag.

387
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:08,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Boonk.

388
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:08,694
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

389
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:11,864
[SPEAKER_09]: because, you know, it has to do with your butt, I guess.

390
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:13,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God!

391
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I like your shirt.

392
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:18,227
[SPEAKER_08]: We watched the bullshit episode about the ass last night.

393
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:19,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games?

394
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:20,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody?

395
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:21,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody play them?

396
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:25,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to segue into video games again by commenting on your shirt.

397
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:26,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sure, yes.

398
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:26,751
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lovely shirt.

399
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:27,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

400
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:28,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wearing a very hot Tanuki shirt.

401
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:29,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pose for the camera right now.

402
00:22:30,313 --> 00:22:30,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at me.

403
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:31,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all sexy.

404
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:32,334
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.

405
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:34,215
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't even see the Tanuki when you do that, Rob.

406
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Move your fucking microphone.

407
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:36,356
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great radio, by the way.

408
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:37,917
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not at all.

409
00:22:38,878 --> 00:22:39,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to god I'm not making this up.

410
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the woman behind the counter was like, um...

411
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the Mario where you, like, killed things with your tail?

412
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:14,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm not sure.

413
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:20,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've been sitting behind here all day doing nothing, and it's starting to get in my brain, because nobody shops at Radio Shack.

414
00:23:21,781 --> 00:23:22,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

415
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:22,742
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

416
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:23,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, more pictures.

417
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like... Do you want a satellite TV?

418
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:28,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like Anna Nicole Smith, only alive.

419
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:29,165
[SPEAKER_05]: This is nice.

420
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:31,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm taking a picture of Rob's shirt.

421
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:32,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Too soon?

422
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:33,848
[SPEAKER_08]: One, two, five.

423
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:35,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, thank you.

424
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:35,936
[SPEAKER_08]: It's blurry, oh well.

425
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:38,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway, let's get into... And I'm not uploading it either.

426
00:23:39,037 --> 00:23:42,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some actual gaming news, because we don't really have any housekeeping tonight.

427
00:23:43,078 --> 00:23:45,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Visit our MySpace... Oh, you have some housekeeping?

428
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:46,099
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want to say?

429
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:48,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just that you need some housekeeping.

430
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:50,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

431
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:54,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, save this show with some awesome exclusives.

432
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,123
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be, like, the best thing ever if you could, like,

433
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:58,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us some video game news no one's heard yet.

434
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:03,464
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the entire lineup for Xbox 360 from Microsoft this year?

435
00:24:03,504 --> 00:24:04,184
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great.

436
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:04,745
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

437
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:11,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start off then with Blue Dragon, which has been announced now for July 11th.

438
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:13,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So look forward to that.

439
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:15,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Sylphid on the 360 for May 16th.

440
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:17,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Tenchu Z coming out June 12th.

441
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:25,610
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 Human, also May 16th.

442
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect, coming out May 30th.

443
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:30,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Shadowrun, June 13th.

444
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:35,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza 2 is slated for May 16th as well.

445
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:36,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that's going to be a pretty big day.

446
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know Halo 3 is around that time too.

447
00:24:39,493 --> 00:24:40,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure some of this stuff is going to move.

448
00:24:40,694 --> 00:24:45,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on top of all those games we have coming out, of course,

449
00:24:46,091 --> 00:24:49,213
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be having a 4,000 point live card coming out in April.

450
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:55,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you didn't really want to spend $20 on live points at the store, now you can spend $40 on live points at the store.

451
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:58,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, I actually know that's more than $50.

452
00:24:58,938 --> 00:24:59,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

453
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:06,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of wondering at first why they would be doing this, but then I think the movie rentals, you know, you can spend a lot of points really quickly on the movie rentals.

454
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:11,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So folks that are downloading the HD movies, I can see... Those cards sell well because people buy them as gifts.

455
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:12,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can see that.

456
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,007
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like iTunes cards.

457
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:14,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

458
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:14,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

459
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:17,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be pretty cool.

460
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:19,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Tetris Evolution is actually coming out.

461
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember Tetris Grandmaster was one of the launch titles in Japan.

462
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's making over here the cheapest 360 game I've seen.

463
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:31,582
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a retail price point of $29.99 when it's coming out in March.

464
00:25:31,843 --> 00:25:32,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

465
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:34,704
[SPEAKER_05]: A moment of applause, please, for this.

466
00:25:35,164 --> 00:25:35,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Applause, please.

467
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:39,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Low price points are awesome.

468
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Got some bad news though.

469
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:44,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Party 8 has been delayed to June.

470
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Or not June, May.

471
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:49,038
[SPEAKER_06]: May 15th.

472
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:50,379
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you know this?

473
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:52,480
[SPEAKER_06]: This is groundbreaking news.

474
00:25:52,680 --> 00:26:01,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Because us distributors talk to the publishers on a daily basis, so they will give us updates to dates all the time.

475
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:06,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And even usually before press releases go out, we get announcements for stuff that hasn't been announced yet.

476
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:10,995
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe announced at certain retail spots but no one's paying attention.

477
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:18,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry guys, you can play Fusion Frenzy 2 in the meantime and then poop on it because it's bad.

478
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you had to play Fusion Frenzy.

479
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:25,184
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest though, most of the Wii games coming out now have party games in them.

480
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:30,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Sonic the Hedgehog, the brand new one, Sonic and the Secret Rings has actually party games in it as well.

481
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:31,268
[SPEAKER_06]: They look kind of fun.

482
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:34,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Rice Princess has a question.

483
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Are the Secret Rings

484
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:46,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, the remakes of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 are slated for the PSP June 13th.

485
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:47,058
[SPEAKER_06]: That's huge!

486
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:49,280
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll be pretty nice as well.

487
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, those are some huge dates you're giving us there.

488
00:26:52,682 --> 00:26:53,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, Loki.

489
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:57,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just glad to see that some actual games are coming out.

490
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:00,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if Microsoft's going to be stacking that many games in May.

491
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:05,153
[SPEAKER_06]: They might try to shuffle stuff around a little bit to kind of spread out the fun, but

492
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:07,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of good stuff for the summer.

493
00:27:09,592 --> 00:27:10,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

494
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:13,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you just paste that picture of my shirt?

495
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

496
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:14,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

497
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:16,717
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of blurry.

498
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:18,759
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see my big fat stomach in there.

499
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:19,519
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very nice.

500
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a cool shirt today.

501
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the perks of being in our chat room live when the show is going on Sunday at 6 o'clock.

502
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:28,466
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Captain America for President.

503
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:31,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Captain America.

504
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:34,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a shirt that says Reggie Fils-Aimé for President.

505
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:37,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd vote for Captain America.

506
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:38,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, damn it.

507
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:45,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I hate you, and I've hated you for years.

508
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

509
00:27:47,393 --> 00:27:49,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you, too.

510
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:52,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, hugs.

511
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:53,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't really touch me, Rob.

512
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:55,577
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is wrong with the program tonight?

513
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:56,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

514
00:27:57,437 --> 00:27:59,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Fireboma says Sky needs to lose a good 200 pounds.

515
00:27:59,939 --> 00:27:59,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh!

516
00:28:05,276 --> 00:28:15,404
[SPEAKER_09]: In related news, Fireboma just got kicked from chat.

517
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:18,587
[SPEAKER_05]: If you come back in, Fireboma, I'm going to sit on you.

518
00:28:18,987 --> 00:28:21,950
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who have never seen Rob, he's like the skinniest man ever.

519
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:23,111
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

520
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:27,875
[SPEAKER_08]: The only way your ass would weigh 500 pounds is if you wore a metal diaper.

521
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:29,879
[SPEAKER_08]: And you pooped in it?

522
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:32,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, God, what is wrong with this program tonight?

523
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:34,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit, pure shit.

524
00:28:34,282 --> 00:28:41,426
[SPEAKER_09]: No, um, I was just saying that I saw a really cute shirt that was, um, Caps Lock, Cruise Control for Awesome.

525
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,608
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really want that shirt a lot.

526
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:44,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what is that a reference to?

527
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:45,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even get it.

528
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what Caps Lock is?

529
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:51,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know what the Caps Lock is, but... It's Cruise Control for Awesome!

530
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:52,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you don't get it?

531
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:56,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And I saw this other one where the front says Ding, and on the back it says Grapp.

532
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:58,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Alice in Wonderland

533
00:29:16,747 --> 00:29:19,468
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be American McGee's Alice, as you know, being made into a movie.

534
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:24,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I apologize to the source, because I don't think I'm supposed to name the source.

535
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:27,152
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you wanted to be named, then I apologize.

536
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:34,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But this information is coming from a very trusted source of Orange Laundry, somebody I've been working with for a while, who just happened to come across this.

537
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:38,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really say how, but got to read the script, the current script as it is for Alice.

538
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, keep in mind, these things change all the time.

539
00:29:42,037 --> 00:29:46,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Alice, as a child, is confronted by her parents due to her uncontrollable fascination with Wonderland.

540
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Against Alice's protest that Wonderland exists, Alice's father takes down possibly anything in her room that would insinuate any thought related to Wonderland.

541
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:25,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Later that night, the house is burned down and the only survivor found is Alice, splattered with blood on her body.

542
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:29,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Forward to the future, Alice is staying in a mental institution.

543
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:38,575
[SPEAKER_05]: An MD, Dr. Hatfield, get it, is interested in Alice and transfers her to another institution, even though doctors tell Hatfield that Alice is impossible to cure.

544
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:43,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Alice then begins a new treatment at the new institution, which is looking more and more abnormal to Alice.

545
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:55,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Alice's old meds are no longer given to her, the other patients are deranged, but one sane doctor named Doyle seems to be the only sane one, and Alice pleads to him for help as she claims she's not who or what she really is.

546
00:30:55,733 --> 00:31:00,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Alice's treatments are getting worse and crueler, and gets wind of Hatfield's surgeries.

547
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:09,165
[SPEAKER_05]: After escaping a scuffle from getting into her first surgery, she follows a rabbit she barely saw in the middle of her struggle and follows it into you-know-where.

548
00:31:09,645 --> 00:31:18,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, apparently there were some notes on the script as well, some possible movies, because some movie names were kind of written on here, some movies that this could be influenced from.

549
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:24,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Twelve Monkeys, Seven, Perfect Storm, Pan's Labyrinth, Jacob's Ladder, What Dreams May Come, Lord of the Rings.

550
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:29,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some bands were written on there as well, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Butthole Surfers,

551
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:39,377
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically Chris Vrena of Nine Inch Nails as well, electronic industrial hip-hop music, and then this is the movie genre, psycho horror action.

552
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:40,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what do you think?

553
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:42,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds kind of neat?

554
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds true to the game?

555
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:43,899
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

556
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:45,259
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds neat.

557
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played the game, but it sounds neat.

558
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I did years ago, but I don't remember it very well.

559
00:31:49,581 --> 00:31:50,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched a speedrun of the game.

560
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:51,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you?

561
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:53,263
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be okay.

562
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:55,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it sounds like it could be interesting.

563
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:56,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Mention a movie I saw today.

564
00:31:57,325 --> 00:31:57,625
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

565
00:31:58,105 --> 00:31:59,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw Pan's Labyrinth today.

566
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:00,737
[SPEAKER_05]: JV Mon says, this sounds awesome.

567
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:25,432
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be very interesting.

568
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Padrino says, I do believe it can be real since the scripts have to make the rounds.

569
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's real too.

570
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:34,016
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, you know, as most scripts do, it's probably going to change a bunch before we see the final product.

571
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:34,676
[SPEAKER_05]: But there you have it.

572
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:38,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Your first look into what the Alice movie has in store.

573
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:39,978
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

574
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:42,759
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about some other news circulating the Internet this week?

575
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's a little bit of happiness going on.

576
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,382
[SPEAKER_08]: For all of us who have been...

577
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:55,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Begging and pleading for Nintendo to do a kitty kitty version of Nintendogs.

578
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:56,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, somebody else is doing it.

579
00:32:57,273 --> 00:32:59,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Crave is putting out Purr Pals for the DS.

580
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:08,786
[SPEAKER_08]: You can choose 40 breeds of kitties and pet them and love them and call them George and you can raise them, you know.

581
00:33:10,308 --> 00:33:10,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It's...

582
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:13,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny, this mentions modifying cat behavior.

583
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:15,016
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

584
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:18,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, cats modify your behavior.

585
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I the only one disappointed that they did not call this Pussy Pals?

586
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,361
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that this article put up a cat macro, though.

587
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:29,782
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, where is your god now?

588
00:33:31,783 --> 00:33:33,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to be picking up Purr Pals?

589
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:34,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

590
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:36,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Can it do Nintendogs justice?

591
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:36,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Because...

592
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

593
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:39,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Kitty.

594
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:42,364
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphical style is totally different from like a Nintendog.

595
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:43,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not realistic cats.

596
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like cartoony alien cats.

597
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:45,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then never mind.

598
00:33:46,008 --> 00:33:47,590
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a video of it on IGN.

599
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,672
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a video of it on other sites?

600
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:51,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually avoid IGN like the plague, though.

601
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:52,135
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.

602
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Except I got lots of Rondo of blood.

603
00:33:56,212 --> 00:33:57,112
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have a lot of videos.

604
00:33:57,152 --> 00:34:00,494
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there was a Cats game that's already been out on the DS.

605
00:34:00,754 --> 00:34:02,315
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do the exact same thing.

606
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:06,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Cats, with a Z at the end, you know, because they're extreme.

607
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:07,737
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a dogs one, too.

608
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:10,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they have the dogs, horses, hamsters.

609
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:16,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, do these cats, like, go base jumping and, like, extreme snowboarding and stuff?

610
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:18,363
[SPEAKER_05]: They're hardcore cats.

611
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,464
[SPEAKER_05]: They do crystal meth and go to raves.

612
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:26,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

613
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:32,638
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have it like, you know, they should have it where the cats actually start scratching the DS and you're like, what the fuck?

614
00:34:32,818 --> 00:34:34,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is your throw up in my DS?

615
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,679
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just stuff like that.

616
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,701
[SPEAKER_08]: They should hack up hairballs and then poo on your, you know, your bathroom rug.

617
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:45,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the chat room is all clamoring out in unison for Love Hamster, which was a game we talked about.

618
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:47,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Hamster does not have a pee in it.

619
00:34:47,764 --> 00:34:50,105
[SPEAKER_05]: TheRobD says, you're just an intent pussy, Rob.

620
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:51,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha ha ha!

621
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:49,408
[SPEAKER_05]: you may want to seek a better copy from Codemasters I think it would be great if there were only 31 levels so they like send it in and it's only one more level and it's like oh okay gotcha thank you wow yeah and that's the same GS68 asks the same thing in chat but can you pass level 31 don't know so what do you think guys now do we do we ease up

622
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:54,537
[SPEAKER_05]: on the folks behind Bubble Bobble for the DS and not make any more level 30 jokes?

623
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:55,658
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

624
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:57,699
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I think it really was?

625
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:05,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they just didn't finish it on time, so they purposely made it so you couldn't pass 30, and so that gave them, like, more time to create more levels and stuff.

626
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:07,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, yeah, now we've fixed it.

627
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:09,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, now you can totally get past level 30.

628
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:16,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've read an interesting theory about that this is just a reflection of the general laziness in QA and testing, because, like, what

629
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:20,716
[SPEAKER_05]: The 360 and other next-gen systems have allowed you to do it with patching.

630
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:24,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Because companies are too spoiled now with the whole patching thing.

631
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:26,580
[SPEAKER_05]: If bugs are discovered, eh, they can go back and patch it.

632
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,643
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is, you can't really patch a DS game without doing a massive recall.

633
00:36:30,843 --> 00:36:34,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, is this maybe why this happened?

634
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:36,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.

635
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:42,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they obviously didn't playtest it because if, you know, oh, I can't pass level 30, I just must suck.

636
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:44,833
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay, other people will be better than I am.

637
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:46,294
So.

638
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:47,636
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

639
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:50,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, moving on into other news.

640
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:55,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of big letdowns, you might remember we even got a call on this last week.

641
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody had said, hey, what do you think Konami's big announcement is?

642
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:04,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember we gave the rundown on Konami Gamers Day last week, right, about the show and all the games we played.

643
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:12,327
[SPEAKER_05]: But Konami had put on their site, hey, boys and girls, stay tuned until Monday because we got some big shit, yo, that we're going to be laying down.

644
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:13,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what it is.

645
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:13,607
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?

646
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:14,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what it is.

647
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:14,688
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

648
00:37:15,293 --> 00:37:15,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

649
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:35,731
[SPEAKER_05]: All got me this little USB Frogger controller, and all you have to do is plug it into the USB port and it installs the game and you can play it.

650
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:38,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm here to tell you, the game sucks balls.

651
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:40,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what we wanted for you.

652
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:44,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Horrible, horrible, sloppy, wrinkly balls is what this game sucks.

653
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:45,333
[SPEAKER_05]: It's horrid.

654
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:46,813
Ew, that's gross.

655
00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:51,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, I spent more time staring at the now-loading screen than I did actually playing the game.

656
00:37:52,054 --> 00:37:53,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's half the fun.

657
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:54,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this, like, on clearance?

658
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:55,854
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

659
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, meaning yes.

660
00:37:57,915 --> 00:37:58,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Not.

661
00:37:58,495 --> 00:37:58,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

662
00:37:58,775 --> 00:37:59,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a dollar.

663
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:03,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it seriously four bucks?

664
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

665
00:38:04,643 --> 00:38:05,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be worth four bucks.

666
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:14,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to make fun of Konami or anything, but... Hey, look, we gave glowing reviews of Gamers Day last week, so I think I can say this shitty little $4 thing sucks, okay?

667
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,308
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to cry.

668
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:28,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember the first Gamers Day we went to, and even the second, like that summer thing, that they had a whole booth set up that they'd show you how to use the USB key thing?

669
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:28,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like...

670
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:31,134
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

671
00:38:53,007 --> 00:38:55,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And then here was, here was the big announcement.

672
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:56,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Here was this quote.

673
00:38:56,888 --> 00:39:00,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, Konami announced new games in its Castlevania and DDR series.

674
00:39:01,169 --> 00:39:05,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be an incredible 2007, so stay tuned to these pages for the latest from Konami.

675
00:39:08,331 --> 00:39:09,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

676
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:14,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everybody was thinking, oh, it's going to be the Metal Gear Solid 4 information.

677
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:15,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's going to be Silent Hill Origins.

678
00:39:15,713 --> 00:39:16,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Silent Hill 5.

679
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:20,754
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was, hey, our big announcement is that we already made our announcements.

680
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:21,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

681
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:21,334
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

682
00:39:21,687 --> 00:39:22,107
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it?

683
00:39:22,147 --> 00:39:22,647
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it!

684
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:24,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even a reach around?

685
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

686
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:27,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm bitter.

687
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:28,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

688
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:33,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Free shitty USB Frogger games for everybody!

689
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:34,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

690
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:41,757
[SPEAKER_06]: If only Barman X Zero were $4.

691
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:46,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tempted to wrap this up in toilet paper and give it away on the station to a lucky listener.

692
00:39:48,618 --> 00:39:50,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there going to be poop on that toilet?

693
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,420
[SPEAKER_05]: No, maybe.

694
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew, but I don't want it.

695
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:54,802
[SPEAKER_05]: No, maybe some Hershey's Kisses or something.

696
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:55,823
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyway.

697
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:56,843
[SPEAKER_11]: From your butt.

698
00:39:56,943 --> 00:39:58,704
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with tonight's program?

699
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:04,368
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like it's, oh, I know, it's that Rice Princess and Eddie the Gay are here, but this program's like off tonight.

700
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:06,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say Eddie the Gay?

701
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:07,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie the Gay.

702
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie Casper the Gay.

703
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:09,591
[SPEAKER_05]: That's his full name, right?

704
00:40:13,754 --> 00:40:14,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm awesome.

705
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:16,576
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, who's got the next story?

706
00:40:16,676 --> 00:40:17,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it me?

707
00:40:17,096 --> 00:40:17,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom.

708
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:18,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

709
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:20,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, I believe it's you.

710
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:21,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it?

711
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:21,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

712
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:21,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

713
00:40:22,164 --> 00:40:23,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not your mom.

714
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:24,645
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be wrong.

715
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:30,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So, looks like Activision has a hair up their ass.

716
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:32,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're suing their own people.

717
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not really their own people.

718
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,792
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're suing people who worked on Guitar Hero now.

719
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:44,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that whole big stink they were having with the Ant Commandos for the unlicensed guitar controller?

720
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're suing them again.

721
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:54,398
[SPEAKER_08]: and also including as defendants some folks that were with Red Octane previously.

722
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:01,861
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be John Tam, Corey... Wasn't John Tam the dude that went to your house?

723
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:02,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, he is.

724
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:03,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh, funny.

725
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:03,922
[SPEAKER_08]: He was pretty cool.

726
00:41:03,942 --> 00:41:04,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not funny.

727
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, John.

728
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not funny, but just interesting.

729
00:41:09,004 --> 00:41:09,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

730
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:10,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Small world.

731
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just sit down and shut up.

732
00:41:13,683 --> 00:41:25,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Also included is Corey Fong and Jamie Yang, who actually started another company that's working in conjunction with the Ant Commandos.

733
00:41:27,687 --> 00:41:36,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, these guys left Red Octane to go work with the Ant Commandos on a yet unannounced game that probably has something to do with guitars.

734
00:41:36,836 --> 00:41:49,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Activision is accusing them of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, misappropriating trade secrets, and confidential information, breach of contract, interference with construction relations, and being stinky.

735
00:41:49,923 --> 00:41:52,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad they don't remember, like, before 2005.

736
00:41:53,365 --> 00:41:55,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just, hmm.

737
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:57,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Katara freaks.

738
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:57,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Ring a bell?

739
00:41:58,268 --> 00:41:58,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody?

740
00:41:59,188 --> 00:41:59,508
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

741
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:02,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I even brought that up in a conversation.

742
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, well, yeah, but we're different.

743
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:06,354
[SPEAKER_05]: No you're not!

744
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:07,495
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, they are.

745
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:09,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, they have five buttons.

746
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:11,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero, no, it's more than that.

747
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:12,379
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it.

748
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:12,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it.

749
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,143
[SPEAKER_05]: The game has a completely different look and feel than Guitar Freaks does.

750
00:42:16,522 --> 00:42:19,044
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's crossed over into popularity in a way.

751
00:42:19,064 --> 00:42:19,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

752
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:20,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Bomani fans.

753
00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:21,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar freaks could never do.

754
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:22,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine.

755
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:27,310
[SPEAKER_06]: If I put Keyboard Mania and made it look like Karaoke Revolution, oh, look, I got Keyboard Hero.

756
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,653
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all he fucking did is they changed the way the game looks.

757
00:42:30,993 --> 00:42:32,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

758
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:34,756
[SPEAKER_06]: The notes come at me instead of straight up.

759
00:42:34,996 --> 00:42:36,978
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what other game did the exact same thing?

760
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:37,818
[SPEAKER_05]: In the groove.

761
00:42:37,898 --> 00:42:41,521
[SPEAKER_05]: How is that different from you have a game like...

762
00:42:42,942 --> 00:42:53,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, you have a platformer game like Mario where he jumps and hits things, and then you have another game with a hero like, I don't know, The Legend of Kage where he jumps and hits things.

763
00:42:53,508 --> 00:42:54,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, that's really obscure.

764
00:42:54,548 --> 00:42:55,609
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exactly the same.

765
00:42:55,629 --> 00:42:57,250
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly the same.

766
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So why isn't it a problem there?

767
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:00,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat

768
00:43:28,211 --> 00:43:29,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, that's an excellent example, though.

769
00:43:29,371 --> 00:43:30,412
[SPEAKER_05]: What about King of Fighters?

770
00:43:30,472 --> 00:43:31,572
[SPEAKER_05]: What about World Heroes?

771
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:32,552
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Art of Fighting?

772
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:33,473
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Street Fighter?

773
00:43:33,553 --> 00:43:37,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Art of Fighting, World Heroes, and King of Fighters were all SNK, so they can get away with it.

774
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:37,614
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

775
00:43:37,654 --> 00:43:38,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I'm saying, though.

776
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:39,535
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're all Street Fighter.

777
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:40,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I'm saying, though.

778
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:43,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Finn Fury actually had multi-plane fighting.

779
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:45,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, here's what I'm saying.

780
00:43:45,437 --> 00:43:50,200
[SPEAKER_06]: If the fucking originators of Fatal Fury came out and said, Oh, we're pissed off that people are copying our game.

781
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,220
[SPEAKER_06]: No, fuck them.

782
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,602
[SPEAKER_06]: They were second in line or third in line.

783
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,122
[SPEAKER_06]: They have no room to talk.

784
00:43:55,302 --> 00:44:02,947
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, you know, if the originators of In the Groove came out and said, Oh, we're pissed off that, you know, Dance Factory came out.

785
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:03,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, fuck you.

786
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,108
[SPEAKER_08]: You copied someone else.

787
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:07,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Sighting games were actually around well before Street Fighter.

788
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:10,671
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, let's not forget, though, remember the old... How's this for obscure?

789
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:10,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

790
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:15,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Pac-Man vs. KC Crazy Chase for the Odyssey 2.

791
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:22,206
[SPEAKER_08]: That game is now so hard to find because of being sued by Williams and Midway.

792
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:23,928
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's the same thing.

793
00:44:24,488 --> 00:44:30,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Maze games have been around in a physical form before there were... Remember the old Mousetrap games?

794
00:44:31,454 --> 00:44:32,655
[SPEAKER_08]: They existed beforehand.

795
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:36,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's just a double standard right now that they really...

796
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:40,460
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what this country was founded on, double standards.

797
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:49,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the whole problem is that Konami didn't do anything to protect their guitar freaks, patents or whatever they had there, so now they can't really stand on that.

798
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:54,068
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still think it's retarded that they're suing over this game.

799
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:55,789
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

800
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:58,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Harmonix is working on something else right now.

801
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,211
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to blow this shit away, and then whatever.

802
00:45:00,251 --> 00:45:03,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's going to get a big boner over that, so whatever.

803
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:04,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho.

804
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:24,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of Guitar Hero, Activision is definitely showing their interest in the Nintendo platforms, talking about doubling their, or aggressively targeting the Wii and DS for titles such as the Spider-Man, Shrek, etc., and talking about bringing Guitar Hero to the Wii.

805
00:45:25,396 --> 00:45:30,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, what I've been reading, though, is it might not actually be Guitar Hero, it might be some other guitar game.

806
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:35,000
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, though, yeah, I guess you could do that, but

807
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,471
[SPEAKER_06]: The DS, I don't know about that.

808
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:38,871
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be kind of dumb.

809
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,272
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll see.

810
00:45:41,192 --> 00:45:43,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, how exactly do you do Guitar Hero on the DS?

811
00:45:43,553 --> 00:45:44,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

812
00:45:44,753 --> 00:45:45,373
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of dumb.

813
00:45:45,613 --> 00:45:45,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

814
00:45:46,194 --> 00:45:46,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

815
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:50,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe something with like you hold the chords with the stylet.

816
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:51,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

817
00:45:51,235 --> 00:45:51,936
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of lame.

818
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,517
[SPEAKER_05]: But then that's why I don't design games, I guess.

819
00:45:55,737 --> 00:45:56,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll have a thumb peripheral.

820
00:45:58,118 --> 00:46:01,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, some other Konami music game related news.

821
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:04,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I should state, by the way, we were the first website anywhere

822
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:10,963
[SPEAKER_05]: and the planet to run the official song list of DDR Universe on the Xbox 360.

823
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:13,024
[SPEAKER_05]: The default song list, what it's going to look like there.

824
00:46:13,985 --> 00:46:17,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Our very own staffer, Mel B, did some work on that and found that.

825
00:46:17,547 --> 00:46:19,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to see that, head on over to orangeontrader.com.

826
00:46:19,908 --> 00:46:21,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting lineup, I've got to say.

827
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:23,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Cascada, you know, Every Time We Touch is in it.

828
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:26,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Rapper's Delight by the Sugar Hill Gang is in it.

829
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:27,012
[SPEAKER_05]: That's got to be fun.

830
00:46:27,432 --> 00:46:30,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kylie Minogue is in it as well, so it's going to be fun.

831
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:33,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it has an equally retarded video like it did in Pump It Up.

832
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:34,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, we'll see.

833
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:35,744
[SPEAKER_06]: That was hilarious.

834
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:40,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I wanted to say this regarding official Konami music games.

835
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:45,027
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an interesting report on Bomani Style that was run earlier this week.

836
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:54,990
[SPEAKER_05]: We received our first confirmation from Betson that Beatmania 2DX Arcade will soon be testing in the next few weeks in Illinois at Brunswick Zone in Naperville.

837
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:01,172
[SPEAKER_05]: No version has been confirmed as of yet, although it is rumored to be Beatmania 2DX Gold.

838
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:02,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

839
00:47:02,717 --> 00:47:08,940
[SPEAKER_05]: What this is basically saying is that possibly Betson could be distributing Beatmania 2DX gold here in the States.

840
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually Beatmania 2DX machines have to be imported from other countries, which is why you see them so, so rarely.

841
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:26,807
[SPEAKER_05]: But very interesting that they would do this now, because Konami didn't announce a Beatmania 2 at their Gamers Day, and they came out with Beatmania 1 last year, which makes me think, I don't know if a Beatmania 2 is coming out for the home.

842
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:30,849
[SPEAKER_05]: So what would be the strategy of them trying to release one in the arcades?

843
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:31,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

844
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:32,910
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, though?

845
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think they should release Beatmania 2DX over here in the arcades, or do you think it's a lost cause?

846
00:47:38,374 --> 00:47:40,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's been places that's had it for years anyway.

847
00:47:42,297 --> 00:47:43,938
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're very niche places, you know?

848
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:50,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and the thing is that the majority of arcades are really going to be really lazy and not want to upkeep that type of machine.

849
00:47:51,003 --> 00:47:55,225
[SPEAKER_08]: So if it's going to be around, it's only going to be at major places that are guaranteed to be well kept.

850
00:47:55,286 --> 00:48:00,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, they're going to be wasting however many thousand dollars a machine is on something they don't want to keep up.

851
00:48:02,222 --> 00:48:06,585
[SPEAKER_05]: JV Mon says get hype through the arcades and then people would be like, hey, I want to play that at home.

852
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:10,908
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe this is a way for them to light a fire under the Beatmania franchise at home.

853
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:11,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

854
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:19,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I had heard the series didn't do that bad, but the fact that they didn't announce a sequel kind of makes you worry.

855
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:23,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh, not really, because I'm wondering if they just don't know what they're going to do with platforms.

856
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:29,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you think about it, say they haven't started a Beatmania 2 yet, where's the

857
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:32,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Say in November.

858
00:48:32,247 --> 00:48:33,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they don't know.

859
00:48:33,448 --> 00:48:36,250
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of a risky thing to do.

860
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:40,034
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why there weren't really any PlayStation 2 games announced at Gamers Day.

861
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:42,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Nerd says something interesting.

862
00:48:42,636 --> 00:48:44,417
[SPEAKER_05]: 2DX barely gets any money in the U.S.

863
00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:45,218
[SPEAKER_05]: to begin with.

864
00:48:45,418 --> 00:48:46,840
[SPEAKER_05]: 2DX Gold will be no different.

865
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:52,064
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, what if they take the Beatmania 2DX machines out of the niche arcades that have them now?

866
00:48:52,124 --> 00:48:53,625
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the arcades that are willing to import games.

867
00:48:53,886 --> 00:48:55,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And they put them in your local bowling alley.

868
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:59,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Your local other arcade would stand to make more.

869
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:02,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, the machines are going to be cheaper if they're done here domestically.

870
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,693
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be half as much, I think.

871
00:49:03,793 --> 00:49:04,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

872
00:49:04,214 --> 00:49:04,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just guessing.

873
00:49:05,395 --> 00:49:08,317
[SPEAKER_05]: But they might stand to make more profit.

874
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:08,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a thought.

875
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:14,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, those machines, it's just that they have the giant plasma screen on it and stuff.

876
00:49:14,803 --> 00:49:18,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, there are a lot of machines nowadays that have giant plasma screens.

877
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:19,547
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know,

878
00:49:20,526 --> 00:49:28,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I know with Golfland, for example, when you have little kids fucking breaking that shit, replacing a plasma screen isn't cheap, and that's, you know, bad.

879
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:35,470
[SPEAKER_08]: One can only hope, though, that if we're going to get it, it's going to at least be in good shape.

880
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:41,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have a little bit of something that will be in good shape because, well, it's brand new.

881
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:44,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have our UK release dates.

882
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:45,293
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that sound?

883
00:49:45,993 --> 00:49:46,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Yippee!

884
00:49:47,393 --> 00:49:49,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming out on...

885
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,940
[SPEAKER_08]: The 16th is a bunch of stuff.

886
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,161
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Armed Assault.

887
00:49:56,941 --> 00:49:58,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Arm A, I guess?

888
00:49:59,282 --> 00:50:14,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Arthur and the Invisibles, Cartoon Network Racing, Excite Truck, God Hand, Infernal, Mario Hoops 3 on 3, Over the Hedge, Hammy Goes Nuts, Sherlock Holmes, The Awakened, Supreme Commander, Toko, Race Driver 3, and Tortuga, Two Treasures.

889
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:18,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

890
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:19,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

891
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:21,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

892
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:23,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I seem kind of short.

893
00:50:23,992 --> 00:50:25,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's... Yeah, I guess it's a slow month.

894
00:50:25,993 --> 00:50:26,853
[SPEAKER_06]: All at the same time, yeah.

895
00:50:27,253 --> 00:50:28,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at the Japanese release dates.

896
00:50:28,634 --> 00:50:30,075
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not much longer, but... Yeah.

897
00:50:30,635 --> 00:50:33,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the U.S., it's a pretty decent week, at least.

898
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:35,418
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see some new stuff for the Wii with Wii Play.

899
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:40,801
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're, you know, short or remote and need to buy one for cheap, Wii Play is the way to go.

900
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:50,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, if you're not in or don't have a Wii, on PlayStation 2, Ghost Rider, which is kind of a ripoff of God of War, but...

901
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,649
[SPEAKER_06]: God of War is not a bad game, so definitely worth checking out.

902
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:55,009
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also cheap, only $29.99.

903
00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:57,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Ghost Rider at E3.

904
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how much the game's changed.

905
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, it's been six months.

906
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,131
[SPEAKER_05]: That game sucked ass at E3.

907
00:51:02,171 --> 00:51:02,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, it was horrid.

908
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:04,311
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks a lot better now.

909
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:08,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's encouraging, because maybe they took all the negative feedback from E3 and did some retooling.

910
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

911
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:10,533
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks pretty... All right, then.

912
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:11,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I retract my statement.

913
00:51:12,033 --> 00:51:13,373
[SPEAKER_05]: A game can change a lot in six months.

914
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:15,614
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks very similar to God of War-like.

915
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Very ripped off of God of War.

916
00:51:18,394 --> 00:51:25,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, The Warriors is coming out on PSP, and that's pretty inexpensive as well, only $19.99.

917
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely check it out.

918
00:51:28,282 --> 00:51:32,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Ratchet & Clank Size Matters on the PSP, if you're a Ratchet & Clank fan.

919
00:51:32,846 --> 00:51:38,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Galactic Civilizations 2 Dark Avatar, the expansion pack for that game is finally coming out.

920
00:51:39,652 --> 00:51:43,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Test Drive Unlimited on PC, finally making its way to the market.

921
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:47,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Guramin, A Monstrous Adventure on the PSP.

922
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:49,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Brand new Atlus game.

00:51:50,547 --> 00:51:52,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas on the PSP.

924
00:51:53,008 --> 00:51:54,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of PSP love this week.

925
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:57,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Monster Kingdom Jewel Summoner.

926
00:52:00,972 --> 00:52:01,212
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

927
00:52:02,392 --> 00:52:02,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

928
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop making comments behind me!

929
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:05,814
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're not making comments at you.

930
00:52:05,894 --> 00:52:08,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm flashing my chest at Irene.

931
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:11,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop getting Irene excited.

932
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:12,897
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really...

933
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:15,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Really distracting.

934
00:52:15,644 --> 00:52:16,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

935
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:17,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God we're not a TV show.

936
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:19,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream Lords on the PC.

937
00:52:20,226 --> 00:52:21,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Brand new MMO.

938
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:26,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, a GameStop exclusive, Tulip.

939
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:28,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta tell you, this game looks like... Wait, it's a GameStop exclusive?

940
00:52:28,649 --> 00:52:29,729
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a GameStop exclusive.

941
00:52:29,769 --> 00:52:30,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Jesus.

942
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:32,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks like a piece of... Wait, wait.

943
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:37,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I played this game at E3 like two years ago when it was first... It was cute.

944
00:52:37,352 --> 00:52:38,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it isn't... Is it 1999?

945
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:39,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that might be okay.

946
00:52:39,773 --> 00:52:40,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

947
00:52:43,007 --> 00:52:47,010
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, yeah, I mean, it isn't going to win any awards, but it was cute.

948
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know what you're getting into, okay?

949
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:50,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game called Tulip, for Christ's sake.

950
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:51,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

951
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:54,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a kissing simulator.

952
00:52:54,394 --> 00:52:55,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a kissing game.

953
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:56,536
[SPEAKER_05]: You go around, you kiss people.

954
00:52:56,876 --> 00:52:58,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, that's going to sell really well.

955
00:52:58,777 --> 00:52:58,857
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

956
00:52:58,877 --> 00:53:00,438
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a sexual harassment game.

957
00:53:00,498 --> 00:53:06,942
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to sell really well amongst the nerds, because they'll need practice kissing, because they don't kiss anyone else except for their moms.

958
00:53:09,744 --> 00:53:10,685
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so wrong.

959
00:53:15,251 --> 00:53:17,352
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Tulip is a $30 game.

960
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:17,352
$29.99.

961
00:53:18,993 --> 00:53:22,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be in the bargain bin in three weeks.

962
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:23,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

963
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:24,876
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it and I know it.

964
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:25,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

965
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:27,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

966
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:27,918
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

967
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:31,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Japanese games coming out on February 15th on the PlayStation 2.

968
00:53:32,248 --> 00:53:34,729
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot, actually, across the various systems.

969
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:36,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing on 360 or any of that stuff.

970
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:40,250
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have on PlayStation 2, Appleseed EX is coming out from Sega.

971
00:53:41,111 --> 00:53:45,652
[SPEAKER_05]: They also are putting Castlevania Curse of Darkness into Konami Best Hits.

972
00:53:46,712 --> 00:53:50,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I should also mention this game, Shining Force EXA is coming out.

973
00:53:51,714 --> 00:53:53,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Soul Cradle.

974
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:56,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Sekai Okuro Mano is coming out.

975
00:53:57,412 --> 00:53:58,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up, Irene.

976
00:53:58,352 --> 00:54:03,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I butcher it every... That's why they have me do the Japanese release dates, because I can't pronounce any of them.

977
00:54:03,294 --> 00:54:03,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

978
00:54:04,175 --> 00:54:05,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate you.

979
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:13,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero no Tsukaima is coming out as well from Marvelous Entertainment on the PlayStation 2.

980
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:18,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Bleach DS Second is coming out.

981
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:20,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And this game sounds like it might be fun.

982
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:22,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Death Note, Kira Game.

983
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

984
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:24,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I want that.

985
00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:24,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out.

986
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,220
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is Death Note?

987
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:26,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know.

988
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Death Note is awesome.

989
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:27,820
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

990
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:28,781
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

991
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:30,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks, Jamie.

992
00:54:30,621 --> 00:54:31,562
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really descriptive.

993
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:33,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, fuck.

994
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pre-order that shit right now.

995
00:54:34,843 --> 00:54:35,443
[SPEAKER_08]: So, shut up.

996
00:54:36,163 --> 00:54:40,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Death Note is a manga done by the same one who did Hikaru no Go.

997
00:54:41,585 --> 00:54:43,966
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really, really, really, really, really, really, really cool.

998
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:49,708
[SPEAKER_08]: They just did a movie, and they're working on a second movie, and the anime's out right now.

999
00:54:50,428 --> 00:54:50,668
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's

1000
00:54:51,437 --> 00:54:52,538
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super awesome.

1001
00:54:52,818 --> 00:54:58,321
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about a guy who finds the notebook of a death god and then starts killing people.

1002
00:54:59,962 --> 00:55:02,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all I'm going to say because everyone should be reading it.

1003
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:10,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's not your cup of tea, Luminous 2 is coming out on the PSP in Japan.

1004
00:55:11,148 --> 00:55:16,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what songs they got different than we did, but I know they have some other songs there instead.

1005
00:55:16,331 --> 00:55:17,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we read them on a previous episode.

1006
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:20,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll have to go back and look, because I'm feeling too lazy.

1007
00:55:21,048 --> 00:55:24,488
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do want to point out, also on Sony PSP, Tales of Destiny 2.

1008
00:55:24,548 --> 00:55:27,169
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a Tales of Destiny fan, there you have it.

1009
00:55:27,729 --> 00:55:28,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Rob.

1010
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:30,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Domo Arigato for that news.

1011
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:31,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1012
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:46,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, why don't you reserve your Domo Arigato for DarkSakura, because she is going to give you her website of the week, and it's the place on the internet that you should definitely be checking out right now.

1013
00:55:46,274 --> 00:55:47,154
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not mine to give.

1014
00:55:47,394 --> 00:55:48,034
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we do...

1015
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:53,114
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the gift that keeps on giving here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1016
00:55:53,134 --> 00:55:55,315
[SPEAKER_08]: It's someone's sick and deranged website.

1017
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well you've found it and you're highlighting it here for us.

1018
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:00,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So, arigato, DarkSakura.

1019
00:56:01,636 --> 00:56:03,377
[SPEAKER_07]: He's gonna kick you, Rob.

1020
00:56:05,217 --> 00:56:06,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that what Scott over on All Games calls you?

1021
00:56:07,038 --> 00:56:07,758
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

1022
00:56:09,218 --> 00:56:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark... DarkBallSakura?

1023
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:13,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearts, love ya.

1024
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:17,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you done?

1025
00:56:17,781 --> 00:56:18,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1026
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:23,040
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's Hardcore Website of the Week!

1027
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

1028
00:56:50,914 --> 00:56:52,635
[SPEAKER_07]: We should do that from now on.

1029
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:57,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Today's website of the week is davidtenant.com.

1030
00:56:57,957 --> 00:57:04,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I want to look up the X music again.

1031
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed that one.

1032
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:11,303
[SPEAKER_08]: No, as I said, today's website of the week is davidtenant.com because I couldn't think of anything else.

1033
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:12,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, never mind.

1034
00:57:12,803 --> 00:57:13,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So much for the hardcore.

1035
00:57:14,784 --> 00:57:15,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Meow, meow, meow.

1036
00:57:15,925 --> 00:57:16,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Meow, meow, meow.

1037
00:57:17,662 --> 00:57:19,983
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be david-tenant.com.

1038
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:23,203
[SPEAKER_08]: He is the man who plays the 10th Doctor on Doctor Who.

1039
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:25,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love him.

1040
00:57:25,804 --> 00:57:26,144
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

1041
00:57:27,004 --> 00:57:29,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should just change this feature to Doctor Who site of the week.

1042
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:31,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Doctor Who website of the week.

1043
00:57:31,225 --> 00:57:33,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I haven't done a Doctor Who site in like three months.

1044
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:37,226
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bite my ass in a non-literal way.

1045
00:57:39,947 --> 00:57:41,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Rice Princess has a question.

1046
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:41,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

1047
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:42,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I help you?

1048
00:57:42,568 --> 00:57:43,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Eddie wants to know.

1049
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:43,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1050
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:49,111
[SPEAKER_09]: In any of the Link... Well, it was just, what, Ocarina of Time and... No, no.

1051
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:56,573
[SPEAKER_04]: What ended up being the only village in the land of Hyrule in the Zelda games, Irene and I pronounce it differently, and we're going to start a debate.

1052
00:57:56,893 --> 00:58:00,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I pronounce it Kakariko Village, and Irene pronounces it...

1053
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:01,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Kakariko.

1054
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be Kakariko.

1055
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:04,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's Asian, so she's probably right.

1056
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:06,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Kakapoopi is what it is.

1057
00:58:06,454 --> 00:58:07,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Kakapoopi Village.

1058
00:58:07,435 --> 00:58:10,137
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us whiteys back in the 90s called it Kakariko Village.

1059
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:16,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but if you read the kana, and the Japanese has pretty much even pronunciation on every syllable, it would be Kakariko.

1060
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:18,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know the village had a name.

1061
00:58:18,724 --> 00:58:20,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you serious?

1062
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:23,108
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly what I was going to say.

1063
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:25,790
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a village that has the chickens that you beat up that all attack you.

1064
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:29,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it is the village.

1065
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:30,790
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Kakariko means.

1066
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,552
[SPEAKER_08]: It means town of chickens.

1067
00:58:33,912 --> 00:58:35,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Town of avenging chickens.

1068
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:52,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, speaking of avenging chickens, we have a brand new program that's being started by Microsoft and kind of teaming up with Old Spice Deodorant to...

1069
00:58:54,744 --> 00:59:00,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the... No, I'm sorry, this is really funny, because you know that stereotype... Because any other game would be uncivilized.

1070
00:59:01,088 --> 00:59:09,333
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but you know, like, the gamer that's been sitting at home all day, racking up these $10... I'm sorry, finish your story, I apologize for interrupting.

1071
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:10,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll make my deodorant joke.

1072
00:59:10,894 --> 00:59:21,381
[SPEAKER_06]: They're basically challenging Xbox Live users, who are in America, to add at least 1,500 achievement points to their gamer score between February 12th and April 12th.

1073
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:29,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And depending on what your gamer score is now, starting off, that'll depend on what prize package you win.

1074
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:34,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And here are the different prize packages for you that you could possibly earn by wasting this much time.

1075
00:59:35,648 --> 00:59:47,698
[SPEAKER_06]: If your gamer score is 0 to 4,999, you can earn a game picture, a dashboard theme, and Contra for Xbox Live Arcade.

1076
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:50,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, that's level 1.

1077
00:59:51,055 --> 01:00:03,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Level 2, which is between 5,000 and 9,999 gamer points, you receive everything from the level 1 package, as well as 100 Microsoft points and a contest t-shirt.

1078
01:00:04,424 --> 01:00:05,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god!

1079
01:00:05,485 --> 01:00:06,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome!

1080
01:00:06,445 --> 01:00:07,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude!

1081
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:08,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I love your shirt!

1082
01:00:08,827 --> 01:00:09,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude!

1083
01:00:10,388 --> 01:00:15,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho, if you have over 10,000 gamer points, you will earn...

1084
01:00:16,618 --> 01:00:22,139
[SPEAKER_06]: The Level 1 Package, 200 Microsoft Points, a T-Shirt, and Fusion Frenzy 2.

1085
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:23,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god!

1086
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:24,960
[SPEAKER_03]: A T-Shirt!

1087
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:25,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude!

1088
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude!

1089
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I gotta get that T-Shirt!

1090
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,861
[SPEAKER_03]: That game fucking sucks, but I gotta get the T-Shirt!

1091
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:40,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, we here at Orange Launch Radio are excited to announce that there's actually some secret levels that have not yet been unveiled, but here's the deal.

1092
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:53,560
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have 20,000 gamer points or more, you're in level 4 and Old Spice will actually send you free deodorant because you probably need it if your gamer score has gotten to be that high.

1093
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:56,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to include it in every level because all of these stink.

1094
01:00:57,163 --> 01:00:58,784
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, no, no, no, we don't care about the prizes.

1095
01:00:58,824 --> 01:01:01,846
[SPEAKER_09]: We really just want to get the deodorant to you and we're masking it with the prizes.

1096
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:02,967
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

1097
01:01:02,987 --> 01:01:05,549
[SPEAKER_05]: The best prizes in level 6, they actually send someone to punch you in the gob.

1098
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:39,320
[SPEAKER_06]: To enter this wonderful contest, just simply go to xbox.com slash rewards and you can enter after the 12th.

1099
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:46,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Hurry up and get those 1500 achievement points so you can score that wonderful Fusion Frenzy 2.

1100
01:01:47,228 --> 01:01:47,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray.

1101
01:01:48,189 --> 01:01:53,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Travis Donovan from our Saturday night program here at Orange Lounge says, Worst product tie-in promo ever.

1102
01:01:54,727 --> 01:02:05,136
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf from the other Sunday Night program on the other network, AllGames.com, says Level 3 package equals 830 point value plus t-shirt plus Bill Gates' favorite game.

1103
01:02:05,736 --> 01:02:07,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, Fusion Frenzy 2 is Bill Gates' favorite game?

1104
01:02:08,919 --> 01:02:09,740
[SPEAKER_06]: What a loser.

1105
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,882
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably the only game he's played this year.

1106
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,203
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, that's my favorite game.

1107
01:02:17,546 --> 01:02:21,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Mystic Gohan says, I'm so tired of hearing, wow, you play so much, your stink is going through the mic.

1108
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:22,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Old Spice!

1109
01:02:28,752 --> 01:02:33,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, something else that is going to cause people to not leave the house for today.

1110
01:02:33,655 --> 01:02:34,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I should ask real quick.

1111
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to participate in this, Loki?

1112
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:37,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck no!

1113
01:02:37,677 --> 01:02:38,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Fusion Frenzy 2?

1114
01:02:39,258 --> 01:02:41,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but you're not at that level.

1115
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:42,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Your gamer score is not 10,000.

1116
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, free t-shirt.

1117
01:02:47,182 --> 01:02:50,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be playing Crackdown, so if I finish Crackdown that quick, I guess.

1118
01:02:50,724 --> 01:02:52,265
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Universe is going to be an easy 1,000 points.

1119
01:02:52,305 --> 01:02:52,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow...

1120
01:02:55,768 --> 01:02:56,949
[SPEAKER_05]: The Halo 3 Beta Invite

1121
01:03:18,206 --> 01:03:25,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo 3 Beta invites the picture that are included with Crackdown, like the little slip that comes in has been leaked out to the internet.

1122
01:03:26,129 --> 01:03:28,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the catch about the Halo 3 Beta.

1123
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:32,571
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have the Crackdown disc to be able to play the Halo 3 Beta.

1124
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:36,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So no buying the game, taking the slip out for the Halo 3 thing, and then selling the game back.

1125
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:43,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually have to hang on to the game, probably past the return window, to actually play the Halo 3 Beta online.

1126
01:03:43,775 --> 01:03:44,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And just another thing, too.

1127
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:50,264
[SPEAKER_06]: The Halo 3 beta might not be available right as you pick up Crackdown.

1128
01:03:50,844 --> 01:03:52,665
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I hope nobody's expecting that.

1129
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:53,485
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be.

1130
01:03:53,545 --> 01:03:55,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope people don't think that's what's going to happen.

1131
01:03:56,886 --> 01:04:00,507
[SPEAKER_05]: It just means that you're going to get into the beta whenever it's available.

1132
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:09,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like a subtle way for them to let people know that they're cracking down on that returning...

1133
01:04:11,926 --> 01:04:13,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Say goodbye to Rice Princess, everyone.

1134
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:13,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the last show.

1135
01:04:14,247 --> 01:04:15,588
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice knowing you, Rice Princess.

1136
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:16,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for playing.

1137
01:04:16,669 --> 01:04:17,029
[SPEAKER_05]: You lose.

1138
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:17,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Failed.

1139
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:28,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in other gaming news, there is a particular little game that a lot of people were sort of obsessed of that didn't go so well in Japan called LocoRoco.

1140
01:04:28,896 --> 01:04:31,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the sequel is now playable.

1141
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:39,843
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go actually onto the website and there is a downloadable version available.

1142
01:04:42,657 --> 01:04:43,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you download it?

1143
01:04:43,677 --> 01:04:44,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet.

1144
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:44,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to?

1145
01:04:44,577 --> 01:04:45,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I haven't been home.

1146
01:04:46,078 --> 01:04:46,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

1147
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,738
[SPEAKER_05]: She got her hair did this weekend.

1148
01:04:48,758 --> 01:04:49,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I got my hair did.

1149
01:04:49,478 --> 01:04:49,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1150
01:04:50,738 --> 01:05:11,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, there also is, though, a little bit of a rumor stating that it could be possible this will be a PS3 version, but honestly, I'm really thinking that it should just stay PSP, because that type of game really lends itself well to the PSP, especially, you know, since you're turning the six success, you know, is not going to be as much fun as

1151
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:13,308
[SPEAKER_08]: The system itself.

1152
01:05:14,109 --> 01:05:15,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Rocking the system itself.

1153
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm hoping it'll go on PSP as well.

1154
01:05:18,871 --> 01:05:25,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Because PSP, you know, actually PSP's having a little bit of a resurgence with the Castlevania and some of these other games that are coming out.

1155
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:29,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in Portable Ops and all these Konami's support behind PSP.

1156
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:34,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually becoming more and more like a system people ought to be checking out.

1157
01:05:34,818 --> 01:05:36,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if a price cut is in the future.

1158
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:37,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought another PSP.

1159
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:37,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you?

1160
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1161
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:38,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

1162
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought it off of a friend.

1163
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:40,161
[SPEAKER_06]: What's this, your 4th?

1164
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:43,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I only have two now.

1165
01:05:44,521 --> 01:05:44,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Only?

1166
01:05:45,322 --> 01:05:45,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1167
01:05:45,782 --> 01:05:51,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, basically, this one is going to be... I'm going to put the Dark Alex firmware on there now.

1168
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:59,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's because my friend, he mistreats his PSP, so he broke the buttons and the analog sticks, so I have to fix that.

1169
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:01,395
[SPEAKER_06]: But I bought it for three bucks.

1170
01:06:01,715 --> 01:06:05,999
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, if you're listening to us on a PSP, you should visit olrpsp.com.

1171
01:06:06,741 --> 01:06:09,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki hasn't updated it in about a year, but it's still pretty.

1172
01:06:09,362 --> 01:06:10,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a background that you can download.

1173
01:06:10,503 --> 01:06:11,944
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be new stuff eventually.

1174
01:06:11,984 --> 01:06:12,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, there will.

1175
01:06:12,804 --> 01:06:13,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm working on stuff.

1176
01:06:13,525 --> 01:06:15,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Right after you finish the Wii website, too, right?

1177
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:19,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that has to do with the PSP.

1178
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:20,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

1179
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's lame.

1180
01:06:24,991 --> 01:06:25,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

1181
01:06:25,391 --> 01:06:26,952
[SPEAKER_05]: This is better than OPSP, really.

1182
01:06:26,992 --> 01:06:32,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, some cool stuff, though, that you might be able to do in the future will include Skype.

1183
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:33,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Because apparently...

1184
01:06:34,873 --> 01:06:48,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the new firmwares coming out, they have dissected the firmware and they have found a little line of code here in 3.11 that says, it talks about the Skype plugin.

1185
01:06:49,303 --> 01:06:54,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something that will be coming out possibly later on, but that's kind of cool though.

1186
01:06:55,067 --> 01:06:58,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So Skype support coming soon to your PSP.

1187
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,031
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that going to work?

1188
01:07:01,071 --> 01:07:03,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's no microphone on it.

1189
01:07:04,351 --> 01:07:05,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have headsets for it.

1190
01:07:05,572 --> 01:07:09,836
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use headsets for... Whatever happened to the DS thing that was like Skype?

1191
01:07:09,876 --> 01:07:11,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when they showed that at E3?

1192
01:07:11,677 --> 01:07:13,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they had the Wi-Fi voice thing?

1193
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:14,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Voice over IP?

1194
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like they have in Metroid Prime Hunter?

1195
01:07:17,682 --> 01:07:18,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they put it in one game.

1196
01:07:18,983 --> 01:07:19,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Big wow.

1197
01:07:19,983 --> 01:07:24,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no, they have it in the new Diddy Kong Racing.

1198
01:07:24,047 --> 01:07:25,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're missing my point.

1199
01:07:25,348 --> 01:07:30,452
[SPEAKER_05]: My point is where is the standalone app where I can use this to call my friends across the U.S.

1200
01:07:30,492 --> 01:07:30,852
[SPEAKER_05]: for free?

1201
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:36,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, now if they had a standalone app, that would mean that they're embracing online.

1202
01:07:37,035 --> 01:07:40,879
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to let everyone know that they're embracing online.

1203
01:07:40,959 --> 01:07:41,660
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a secret.

1204
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, because they haven't actually embraced online.

1205
01:07:44,864 --> 01:07:47,627
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually making the internet harder, is what Nintendo does.

1206
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:48,367
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't understand, Rob.

1207
01:07:48,488 --> 01:07:49,108
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't understand.

1208
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:49,989
[SPEAKER_06]: We connect 24.

1209
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:51,411
[SPEAKER_06]: It's connected all the time.

1210
01:07:51,471 --> 01:07:53,053
[SPEAKER_06]: That means it's connected to...

1211
01:07:54,108 --> 01:07:55,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Something out there.

1212
01:07:55,749 --> 01:07:57,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that makes my Wii glow.

1213
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:01,152
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I turn it on to see what that something is, there's nothing there.

1214
01:08:01,412 --> 01:08:04,373
[SPEAKER_06]: But shortly after I turn it on, there's stuff there.

1215
01:08:04,894 --> 01:08:07,835
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just it lets me know soon there will be more stuff there.

1216
01:08:08,075 --> 01:08:10,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Wake me up when the Wii downloads my porn for me.

1217
01:08:11,217 --> 01:08:15,959
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck is... Seriously, and I hate to go on a rant about it again, but what the fuck is up with Wii Connect 24?

1218
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:17,320
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't download my messages.

1219
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have current weather.

1220
01:08:19,141 --> 01:08:20,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have current news.

1221
01:08:20,982 --> 01:08:22,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't download any updates.

1222
01:08:22,422 --> 01:08:23,523
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck is it doing?

1223
01:08:24,272 --> 01:08:25,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Is your Wii on?

1224
01:08:26,793 --> 01:08:28,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, my Wii is on.

1225
01:08:29,214 --> 01:08:32,676
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's devil power making it glow.

1226
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:35,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be a Nintendo customer service rep.

1227
01:08:36,258 --> 01:08:37,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had the total opposite experience.

1228
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:40,600
[SPEAKER_04]: My Wii starts glowing, I turn it on, and there's messages right there.

1229
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,981
[SPEAKER_04]: All the updates are downloaded without me having to do anything, so I don't know what you're doing.

1230
01:08:45,502 --> 01:08:49,024
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but don't you have to click in and actually do the update manually?

1231
01:08:49,424 --> 01:08:49,644
[SPEAKER_05]: What?! !

1232
01:08:53,174 --> 01:08:54,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never had to do that.

1233
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have the news channel on your Wii right now?

1234
01:08:58,097 --> 01:08:58,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1235
01:08:58,577 --> 01:09:02,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when there's a new server, because they're not just going to do that without you wanting to do it.

1236
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:07,743
[SPEAKER_04]: But the messages are there, the updates of like, yeah, it'll tell you right away.

1237
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:12,846
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the thing, is that Wii Connect 24 is supposed to do all that shit without you having to think about it, right?

1238
01:09:13,587 --> 01:09:16,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the extra apps, though, because you have to choose what apps you want.

1239
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:19,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'd be kind of mad if I won, and I was like, I don't want that app, and it was on there, you know?

1240
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:21,612
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, the messages, I don't have to download them.

1241
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:23,085
[SPEAKER_04]: They're already there when I turn it on.

1242
01:09:45,131 --> 01:09:46,432
[SPEAKER_06]: What if you don't want the internet browser?

1243
01:09:46,452 --> 01:09:47,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad!

1244
01:09:47,193 --> 01:09:48,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Then don't download it!

1245
01:09:48,854 --> 01:09:50,795
[SPEAKER_06]: The internet browser you don't have to download.

1246
01:09:50,915 --> 01:09:51,976
[SPEAKER_06]: It's news and weather.

1247
01:09:52,376 --> 01:09:53,577
[SPEAKER_06]: You need your news and weather.

1248
01:09:54,598 --> 01:09:56,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I really need that really bad.

1249
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:00,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to take a quick poll of all the Wii owners in the room.

1250
01:10:00,982 --> 01:10:05,946
[SPEAKER_05]: How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?

1251
01:10:06,086 --> 01:10:08,067
[SPEAKER_05]: How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?

1252
01:10:08,368 --> 01:10:09,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go first.

1253
01:10:09,488 --> 01:10:13,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used the forecast channel twice and the news channel three times.

1254
01:10:14,082 --> 01:10:17,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And once was this week because I was looking for pictures of Anna Nicole Smith.

1255
01:10:18,124 --> 01:10:18,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1256
01:10:19,105 --> 01:10:27,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I used the forecast channel once today, but it had weather from midnight, which said it was still raining, yet outside it's blurring sun, so apparently that was wrong.

1257
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:32,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki went outside in a huge parka going, Man, fuck the week!

1258
01:10:33,356 --> 01:10:33,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1259
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,882
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?

1260
01:10:52,902 --> 01:10:54,102
[SPEAKER_06]: She's holding up a big fat zero.

1261
01:10:54,162 --> 01:10:54,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Eddie?

1262
01:11:21,088 --> 01:11:22,330
[SPEAKER_05]: One time, when I first got it.

1263
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan just used it, though.

1264
01:11:25,134 --> 01:11:25,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, every day?

1265
01:11:26,336 --> 01:11:29,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I just happened to be in the living room and he had it up while I was leaving.

1266
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:29,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so once.

1267
01:11:30,281 --> 01:11:32,785
[SPEAKER_08]: More than that, but I saw it once.

1268
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:36,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't used either before, but I use the Foreskin channel a lot.

1269
01:11:37,768 --> 01:11:38,289
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1270
01:11:55,188 --> 01:11:59,432
[SPEAKER_05]: The PSP and the PS3 networks will be joining together.

1271
01:12:00,132 --> 01:12:01,854
[SPEAKER_05]: That was coming from Phil Harrison.

1272
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:06,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, this year we'll be adding some functionality to the PSP that will unify our approach.

1273
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:10,421
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really don't know what exactly that means yet.

1274
01:12:10,461 --> 01:12:14,205
[SPEAKER_06]: That means I don't have to buy a PlayStation 3 to download PlayStation 1 games to my PSP.

1275
01:12:15,323 --> 01:12:21,185
[SPEAKER_05]: If maybe that means that they'll have the same look and feel of the store or what's going on, but we don't really know.

1276
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:28,068
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that the PlayStation Portable will actually have a network store, since it doesn't right now.

1277
01:12:28,868 --> 01:12:32,790
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of nice, because the Sony website isn't even that great on the PSP.

1278
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've gone to it.

1279
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:34,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that great.

1280
01:12:34,891 --> 01:12:38,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I try not to go to it, because it's lame.

1281
01:12:38,512 --> 01:12:38,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame.

1282
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:47,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm reading comments in chat room, by the way, who's giving some feedback on the whole debate we were having in here.

1283
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:50,302
[SPEAKER_05]: James Patrick says, Forecast is good here in Texas.

1284
01:12:50,363 --> 01:12:51,784
[SPEAKER_05]: It told me it was going to rain a couple times.

1285
01:12:53,025 --> 01:12:53,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1286
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Bershaz says, Wait, we are gamers.

1287
01:12:56,689 --> 01:12:57,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We are in the basement.

1288
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,191
[SPEAKER_05]: No windows.

1289
01:12:58,691 --> 01:12:59,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I forgot.

1290
01:12:59,712 --> 01:13:00,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

1291
01:13:00,693 --> 01:13:01,554
[SPEAKER_05]: How could I forget?

1292
01:13:01,714 --> 01:13:03,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, because we're on the second story.

1293
01:13:05,018 --> 01:13:05,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1294
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:06,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Well.

1295
01:13:08,742 --> 01:13:17,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually read an article last week about an HMV UK retailer who was doing a PSP, PS3 bundle.

1296
01:13:17,707 --> 01:13:23,530
[SPEAKER_08]: They have retracted it now due to consumer pissed-offness.

1297
01:13:24,531 --> 01:13:26,392
[SPEAKER_08]: They've heard the people... Is that the legal term?

1298
01:13:26,572 --> 01:13:27,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, pissed-offness.

1299
01:13:28,213 --> 01:13:29,413
[SPEAKER_08]: They have heard the people.

1300
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:33,956
[SPEAKER_08]: They have gone back and said that for anyone who's participated in the pre-order...

1301
01:13:34,488 --> 01:13:36,389
[SPEAKER_08]: They did this in response to customer demand.

1302
01:14:04,602 --> 01:14:05,703
[SPEAKER_05]: PMS of the Masses

1303
01:14:28,717 --> 01:14:29,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is kind of interesting.

1304
01:14:29,837 --> 01:14:37,020
[SPEAKER_06]: You tilt the screen around, moving the mother duck to collect the baby ducks and reach the end.

1305
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that will be coming sometime soon, I guess.

1306
01:14:43,882 --> 01:14:53,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, they were talking about SingStar for the PlayStation 3 and how the PlayStation Store will be supporting that as well.

1307
01:14:55,506 --> 01:14:57,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, that's not a big surprise.

1308
01:14:58,237 --> 01:15:06,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you know, also talking about how people will be able to create their own custom user pages, including video performances of them singing.

1309
01:15:07,304 --> 01:15:11,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume that you would need the eye toy for this, or the eye of judgment, or whatever, you know.

1310
01:15:13,608 --> 01:15:17,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, they were talking about Will Simon Cowell be a part of the eye of judgment?

1311
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:18,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was awful.

1312
01:15:19,573 --> 01:15:20,253
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they will not.

1313
01:15:20,293 --> 01:15:22,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you should take a gun and shoot yourself in the face.

1314
01:15:23,513 --> 01:15:28,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, the PlayStation 3 online platform will continue to evolve aggressively.

1315
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:35,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's great, because one game, or less than one game a month, kind of sucks right now with your PlayStation online store.

1316
01:15:35,957 --> 01:15:39,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people bitch about no updates to the Xbox 360's market, but geez.

1317
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:45,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, at least Xbox 360's getting stuff, you know, on a weekly basis at least.

1318
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:49,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I have yet to see some new demos come to the PlayStation 3 store.

1319
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:51,909
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's early, I mean, for PlayStation.

1320
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:54,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Xbox was slow in the beginning as well.

1321
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:56,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that, but still, though, I mean, come on.

1322
01:15:57,872 --> 01:15:58,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to see an update.

1323
01:15:59,152 --> 01:16:00,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's new stuff on the PlayStation store.

1324
01:16:00,733 --> 01:16:03,334
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new PS1 game that you can't play on the PS3.

1325
01:16:03,654 --> 01:16:04,915
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to play it on your PSP.

1326
01:16:05,135 --> 01:16:05,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fuck you.

1327
01:16:06,555 --> 01:16:09,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven's Dolphin says, Loki, I think the duck is a joke I do not know.

1328
01:16:09,377 --> 01:16:10,037
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the duck joke?

1329
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:14,813
[SPEAKER_06]: The duck they showed at every new console launch.

1330
01:16:14,853 --> 01:16:16,475
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the tech demo that they had.

1331
01:16:17,876 --> 01:16:18,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the rubber duckie.

1332
01:16:18,837 --> 01:16:22,880
[SPEAKER_08]: The way they filled the tub with the rubber ducks to do how many on-screen polygons.

1333
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:28,364
[SPEAKER_08]: That was on the very first disc, the PS position demo disc.

1334
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:39,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of PlayStation, at least the portable types, they're going to get you in trouble in New York City pretty soon, but don't worry, Sony fanboys, Nintendo DS is a fair game as well.

1335
01:16:39,393 --> 01:16:40,014
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the reason

1336
01:16:40,424 --> 01:16:41,585
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1337
01:16:57,327 --> 01:16:58,708
[SPEAKER_05]: It's legislation.

1338
01:16:58,728 --> 01:17:00,410
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't been passed yet, but it's on the table.

1339
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:10,380
[SPEAKER_05]: You could be charged a $100 fine if you're using a PSP, a Nintendo DS, an iPod, a Blackberry, or a mobile phone all while crossing the road.

1340
01:17:10,921 --> 01:17:12,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1341
01:17:12,102 --> 01:17:13,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's interesting.

1342
01:17:13,563 --> 01:17:16,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Dangerous to use a device and walk?

1343
01:17:16,787 --> 01:17:18,028
[SPEAKER_06]: What about people driving?

1344
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:20,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's dangerous, too!

1345
01:17:20,663 --> 01:17:21,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1346
01:17:21,424 --> 01:17:22,806
[SPEAKER_08]: It is illegal there, too, isn't it?

1347
01:17:23,067 --> 01:17:27,253
[SPEAKER_05]: But, well, yeah, I mean, that's already illegal in New York City, but you have to remember... It's illegal here, too, Rob.

1348
01:17:27,313 --> 01:17:29,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind... Well, not yet, but it almost is.

1349
01:17:29,456 --> 01:17:29,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

1350
01:17:29,977 --> 01:17:33,382
[SPEAKER_05]: But keep this in mind, is that... I switched to speakerphone anyway.

1351
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Back off, lady!

1352
01:17:35,891 --> 01:17:36,291
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1353
01:17:58,576 --> 01:18:02,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Who the fuck can play a game and walk in the first place is what I want to know, but, you know, whatever.

1354
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:03,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're doing it.

1355
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:08,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our New York City living friends chime in on this in the chat.

1356
01:18:08,324 --> 01:18:11,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, Sky, some people are too stupid to pay attention.

1357
01:18:11,546 --> 01:18:14,889
[SPEAKER_05]: You do not turn the volume up to the point where you cannot hear a honking horn.

1358
01:18:15,509 --> 01:18:18,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of Zaku says, looks like this guy hasn't heard about natural selection.

1359
01:18:19,853 --> 01:18:20,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen to that.

1360
01:18:20,994 --> 01:18:22,255
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think about this law?

1361
01:18:22,695 --> 01:18:24,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a needed law?

1362
01:18:24,477 --> 01:18:25,037
[SPEAKER_05]: A necessity?

1363
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:27,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I think...

1364
01:18:28,127 --> 01:18:32,128
[SPEAKER_08]: That Darwinism should just be let work because that would cleanse the gene pool.

1365
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:33,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1366
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:34,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1367
01:18:36,269 --> 01:18:40,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have to blame Grand Theft Auto for this because in Grand Theft Auto you run over people.

1368
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:44,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore, Grand Theft Auto is to blame because these people are getting run over by cars.

1369
01:18:44,972 --> 01:18:46,052
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes perfect sense.

1370
01:18:46,312 --> 01:18:48,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is the justice with these damn M-rated games?

1371
01:18:49,213 --> 01:18:54,514
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to take them off the shelves because clearly it's not incompetent people that are causing deaths.

1372
01:18:55,215 --> 01:18:56,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It is these M-rated games.

1373
01:18:58,226 --> 01:18:59,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1374
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:29,365
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1375
01:19:51,616 --> 01:19:52,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1376
01:20:12,409 --> 01:20:18,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking they shouldn't pass that so that people can still be getting hit by cars while they're doing that.

1377
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:22,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I can just run over and take their PSP while they're on the ground, dying.

1378
01:20:22,495 --> 01:20:24,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, yes, I have a PSP now.

1379
01:20:24,136 --> 01:20:25,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're so sympathetic.

1380
01:20:25,096 --> 01:20:25,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1381
01:20:26,057 --> 01:20:26,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I would totally do that.

1382
01:20:27,078 --> 01:20:27,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, me too.

1383
01:20:27,898 --> 01:20:28,799
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you're stupid.

1384
01:20:28,839 --> 01:20:29,939
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't deserve one of these.

1385
01:20:30,019 --> 01:20:32,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I sense the angst rising in this room.

1386
01:20:32,481 --> 01:20:34,442
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what happens when the angst rises?

1387
01:20:35,202 --> 01:20:36,123
[SPEAKER_05]: People die.

1388
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:49,223
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for the FUs of the week here, boys and girls.

1389
01:20:49,323 --> 01:20:51,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the FUs of the week.

1390
01:20:51,225 --> 01:20:53,667
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, then start us off.

1391
01:20:54,107 --> 01:21:02,514
[SPEAKER_08]: A big FU to the medical industry for being more interested in selling us drugs than actually fixing the problem.

1392
01:21:07,978 --> 01:21:17,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they give you all these drugs that do nothing but, you know, treat the symptoms or suppress the symptoms that your body, you know, creates to help you heal.

1393
01:21:17,927 --> 01:21:21,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And making us more and more and more and more and more dependent on them.

1394
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:27,856
[SPEAKER_08]: When I think, you know, it's one thing that if you, like, say, have, like, diabetes and need insulin.

1395
01:21:27,876 --> 01:21:28,577
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one thing.

1396
01:21:28,737 --> 01:21:30,719
[SPEAKER_08]: That's chronic condition.

1397
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,202
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, if you have the flu...

1398
01:21:35,205 --> 01:22:02,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And think, oh my god, I need to take this drug and this drug and this drug and this drug When all you have to do is drink some tea, take some vitamin C, and take some time off work and sleep You don't need to pay the whole reason that the medical field is so fucked up right now Is because people are too dependent on treating symptoms I've learned so much since going into massage therapy about how the body works

1399
01:22:03,604 --> 01:22:07,266
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, if you're stressed out, take some fucking time and breathe.

1400
01:22:08,107 --> 01:22:10,849
[SPEAKER_08]: You're dumping adrenaline and other toxins into your liver.

1401
01:22:10,889 --> 01:22:12,550
[SPEAKER_08]: You are making yourself fucking sick.

1402
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Just stop and breathe.

1403
01:22:16,772 --> 01:22:17,072
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1404
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:18,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1405
01:22:19,294 --> 01:22:20,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up, Firebomba.

1406
01:22:20,294 --> 01:22:20,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you.

1407
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:22,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give happy endings.

1408
01:22:22,596 --> 01:22:27,099
[SPEAKER_05]: See, if you want to join our chatroom, you too can get yelled at by DarkSakura.

1409
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:32,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to make a nephew to the Highway Patrol in California.

1410
01:22:32,642 --> 01:22:32,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1411
01:22:33,258 --> 01:22:35,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not very angry today.

1412
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1413
01:23:02,069 --> 01:23:11,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Activision for suing people over Guitar Hero, the completely original guitar game out there.

1414
01:23:11,896 --> 01:23:21,302
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week goes to my doctor for not being available when I need her, and to the dentist for my temporary crown falling out a second time.

1415
01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:22,323
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just lovely.

1416
01:23:23,924 --> 01:23:25,225
[SPEAKER_05]: RicePrincess, do you have any FUs?

1417
01:23:25,305 --> 01:23:26,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Any angst you'd like to get off your chest?

1418
01:23:27,025 --> 01:23:32,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wanted to say F you too because you're playing this version of One Man Angel when you should be playing the piano version.

1419
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:33,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

1420
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:34,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's choice, not mine.

1421
01:23:34,951 --> 01:23:35,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1422
01:23:35,432 --> 01:23:37,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can play that one.

1423
01:23:37,733 --> 01:23:40,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it would be an honor if Amy and I remember that one.

1424
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:42,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, but nobody else does.

1425
01:23:42,637 --> 01:23:43,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's okay.

1426
01:23:43,758 --> 01:23:47,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then we can refresh their memories by reenacting it on their own.

1427
01:23:47,181 --> 01:23:48,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I deleted that MP3.

1428
01:23:48,202 --> 01:23:49,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to punch you.

1429
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:51,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Eddie.

1430
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:51,784

[SPEAKER_05]: Look out!

01:24:09,328 --> 01:24:11,209
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a good comeback, right?

1438
01:24:11,309 --> 01:24:12,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Look out!

1439
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:14,452
[SPEAKER_09]: You need a third eye for that.

1440
01:24:16,214 --> 01:24:17,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody understands that.

1441
01:24:17,615 --> 01:24:18,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody on the internet.

1442
01:24:18,356 --> 01:24:20,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know, because no one listens to the Wednesday show.

1443
01:24:20,357 --> 01:24:20,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Jerk.

1444
01:24:21,252 --> 01:24:24,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, I think now's a very good time to take a break.

1445
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you kids, but I think now's a good break time.

1446
01:24:27,035 --> 01:24:28,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to take a break right now.

1447
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:30,957
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
