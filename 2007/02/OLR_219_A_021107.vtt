00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Loco King!

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, February 11th, 2007, Xbox gamerscore whores might get rewarded soon,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
an old PC gaming franchise is said to be coming back,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
and we have some exclusive news on the Alice movie.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello, everybody out there on the Internet.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
We are that podcast on the Internet

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
dedicated to video gaming and gaming culture

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
and what you, the gamer, really want to know.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And I'm here to help you through that.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Joining me, as always, say hello to my lovely co-hosts

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
in that corner, the happiest bunny on the farm,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Roar.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Fresh off the highway.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Seriously.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
How many small furry animals did you run over on your way here?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Absolutely zero.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
That's good to know.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
How many SUV drivers did you run off the road on your way here?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Fifty.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
All right. Good to hear.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Good job.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Massa.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Loki.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hello.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Good.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Did you run anyone off the road on the way here?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
No, only in game earlier.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
All right.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
That's good to hear.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
First off, I want to apologize for my sound tonight

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
because, A, I'm recovering from a cold,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
so I sound a little bit congested.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I got the plague.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I guess in 2007 this will be the year of Rob getting the plague

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
instead of Jamie getting the plague all the time,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
so that's entertaining.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
You'll have the plague if you develop bronchial pneumonia

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
and lose 20 pounds in three weeks.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Hopefully it's not that.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I tried to get an appointment with a doctor,

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
but they were like,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
The earliest the doctor can see you is Tuesday.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
That's what she sounded like, too.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
The earliest the doctor can see you is Tuesday.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
This is on Friday.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm like, Tuesday.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Well, I hope to be better by Tuesday,

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
so I guess an appointment's not necessary.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Thank you.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
It's like, ah, jerks.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Urgent care.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
My co-pays hire for urgent care.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I don't want to deal with that.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Anyway, I'm doing better on my own

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
by taking over-the-counter drugs.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Drugs are my friend.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Over-the-counter, all legal.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
All right.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Anyhow.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh, that only suppresses your healing process.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh, whatever.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Anyhow.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Oh, also, and then the microphone I used to use, dead.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
Dead as hell, run over by too many rolling chairs here in the office.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
It's dead a million times over,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
so I have a new microphone that sounds like I'm talking out of a tin can,

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
even though this microphone probably costs twice as much

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
as Loki's microphone that he's using.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Which the top is falling off of this microphone.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Oh, that's just lovely to hear.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, then you'll have a tin can microphone soon, too.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
My microphone's working just fine.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I want that, but that was donated to us.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I have no idea where that microphone came from.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
I know who it came from.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I know where it came from.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I mean, I know who donated it.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
We don't want to get them.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Really?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Because we need two more like that.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Guitar center.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Really?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
And that's where we're going.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
We're going shopping.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Any place that sells microphones.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
We're going shopping.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
No, dude, I got this at Radio Shack.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I was like, oh, Radio Shack, you know, they have like ten different microphones.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
You need radio crap.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, I mean, this microphone, I don't want to tell you how much it was,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
but I'll say it was twice as much as that one,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
and it has the tin can sound to it.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
So, I don't know.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I think it'll just take some getting used to.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Just put it up to your neck and go, hello.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Next week in front of me is funny.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Oh, really?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Okay.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Being told secrets from Jamie.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
So, maybe we will get a shopping spree next week.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Who knows?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Wait, are you saying I should do this, Loki?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Hello, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
All right.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Anyway, I'm being rude and have not introduced our special guest yet.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
So, these are some buddies of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Say hello to Rice Princess.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
She's been on the show before.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yes, I have.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Hello.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
How are you?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
She's the one that never like talks loud enough,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
so you can never hear her in the microphone.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Sorry.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
So, Rice Princess, I want you to just yell at me tonight.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Just yell.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
You fucking asshole!

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
There you go.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Great.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Hi.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Now we can hear you.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
All right.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
And also say hello to Eddie.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Yep.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
That's me.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Have you ever been on this show before, Eddie?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, like three or four years ago.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Big, fruity, gay Eddie.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Casper the Gay.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
That's me.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Casper the Gay.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Eddie the Friendly Gay.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
What kind of games are you into since you've never been on the show before?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Never been on the show before.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
You haven't been on here since we've been podcasting.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
When you were on the show, we had like five people listening,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
and we thought we were the shit.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Including us in the room.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
That's exactly.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It was like the live studio audience was it.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
We were live performers.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
But now we have this whole internet podcast, iPod thing.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
It's crazy.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
All right.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
So what type of games are you into?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Fantasy adventure.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm a diehard Nintendo fanboy, which everybody I guess is not as bad anymore,

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
because Wii's pretty cool.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
But yep.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Fantasy adventure kind of games like Zelda.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
It was-

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
RPGs.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Was Zelda like your favorite game that came out last year, you'd say?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Twilight Princess by far.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
What would you say is your favorite video game of all time,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
just so we have something to go off of here?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Of all time?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Probably like Link to the Past, something like that.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So you're a total Link fanboy.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Nerd.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Nerd.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Nerdy nerd.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
All right.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, Casper the Gay, do you follow gaming news a lot?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Do you follow the gaming culture?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I log on to the IGN sometimes.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Really?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You shouldn't log on to those big money sites, though.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, I know.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
The correct answer is,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
I read independent blogs like Destructoid and Kotaku.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
There you go.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Whatever Rob said.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And I'll go to Orange Lounge Radio for all my news,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
and Augames.com, they're the shit.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
There you go.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Good job, Eddie.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah, good.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That's what it sounds like.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
All right.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Also, no.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Actually, you know, as far as the big box...

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Why is Eddie Mr. Bill?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
I don't know.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
As far as the big box sites go,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
IGN doesn't bug me nearly as bad as some of the others.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Anyway, let's see.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm reading chat room,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
because we also have the chat room is always here

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
to lend their perspective as well.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
We love our chat room.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Let's see.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
What do we have here?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
J.P. Bond says,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Yay Rice Princess.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Dark Knight says,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
What is up, our home girl?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
You didn't say it right, Rob.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I'm doing very good.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
How about you?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Good.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Let's see.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Act Deaf says,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Isn't every gay person friendly?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
No.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
No.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Absolutely not.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I've dated some real bitches in the past.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
No, no, no.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
No, no.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
No, no, no, no.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
In fact, we could name some on this program,

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
but we're above that.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
I'm not.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
All I have to say...

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
All of you.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
No, I'm just kidding.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
If you like to listen to the live shows on Orange Laundrio,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
because, you know, we don't just do this podcast.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
We have live shows there as well.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Wednesday happens to be guys on the show,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
and it's our Valentine's Day special.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
We're going to be calling some of our exes on air

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
and wishing them a happy Valentine's Day,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
so that'll be a good time.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
Anyway, let's see.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
J.P. Bond says,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I am gay, and I am far from friendly.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
You know, I met J.P. Bond in person.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
He was just shy.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Oh, man, he's gay?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yes.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
I thought, like, he was a straight boy that had a crush on me,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
because he was happy that I was on.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I was like, oh, yes, I'm going to get a boy...

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
You should know this.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Weren't we just talking the other day?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I promise we'll get into video game news soon.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Weren't we just saying the other day

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
when I was watching Lifetime movies,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
because I was sick, and when I'm home sick,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I watch Lifetime movies, and there was a...

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
You happened to be over.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
I was watching one.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
There was a commercial for Gay, Straight, or Taken.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Yes.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
And you were like,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I was born to be on that show.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Apparently, I'm not.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
I'm going to be, like, the worst person ever.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm going to get it totally wrong.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Have you heard of this show, Dark Soccer?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Gay, Straight, or Taken on Lifetime?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
It's...

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
TV?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah, I know.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I know you don't watch Lifetime,

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
so that's why I'm sharing this with you.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
I don't even have cable, Rob.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Okay.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
The extent of my cable is court TV.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Are you familiar with Lifetime, vagina television?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Are you familiar with Lifetime?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Yes.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Television, vagina...

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I haven't watched Lifetime in easily three years.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Right.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, Lifetime is, like, women's TV, and, like, you know, all the...

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
That's why I don't watch it.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
It's stupid.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
The movies they have on there are, like, the best movies ever.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
They have, like, you know, Final Justice, the story of the woman who stood, you know,

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
in, like, you know...

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Who stood in line at Walmart.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.600
The story of the woman who was horribly raped and murdered and had, you know, a Lifetime

07:43.600 --> 07:44.600
movie made out of her.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.600
And had ear mites.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.600
Right.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.600
I frickin' love Lifetime movies.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.600
Or the most recent one...

07:48.600 --> 07:49.600
I should pick up a Lifetime movie.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.600
Was the Fantasia...

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
You should be a Lifetime movie.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.600
No way.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.920
Dark Sakura, the gamer girl of the millennia, I don't know.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.360
The Fantasia Burino story was one I just recently watched.

07:59.360 --> 08:04.240
But anyway, my point is, there's commercials for this show, this new show they're doing,

08:04.240 --> 08:05.640
Gay, Straight, or Taken.

08:05.640 --> 08:10.000
It's a dating show, and the thing is that a woman goes out on a date with a gay man,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.280
a straight man, and a guy who's already married or taken, has a girlfriend.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.600
And at the end is when she finds it, like, she has to pick which one's which, and if

08:18.600 --> 08:23.080
she correctly picks the straight man, then they win, like, a fabulous, you know, date

08:23.080 --> 08:25.000
prize, like, Hawaii-type thing.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.360
But if she picks one of the others, then they win a prize, and she gets nothing.

08:28.360 --> 08:32.160
Yeah, because whiny straight girls have it so hard.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.160
What?

08:33.160 --> 08:35.560
So, is this something you would watch?

08:35.560 --> 08:36.560
No.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.560
Hell no.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.680
Should they make a...

08:39.680 --> 08:42.320
Is this a video game that would appeal to gamer girls?

08:42.320 --> 08:43.320
Is this...

08:43.320 --> 08:47.280
Because, you know, there's always that thing going around, like, how do we get women into

08:47.280 --> 08:48.280
gaming?

08:48.280 --> 08:49.280
How...

08:49.280 --> 08:50.280
Because I've got two women in here.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.280
I know how to make...

08:51.280 --> 08:52.280
How do we get women into gaming?

08:52.280 --> 08:57.540
Do we need Lifetime to bring out, like, you know, the video voyeur, the Susan Wilson video

08:57.540 --> 08:58.540
game?

08:58.540 --> 08:59.540
Is that...

08:59.540 --> 09:00.540
Is that what we need?

09:00.540 --> 09:01.540
I'm having a terrible hair day.

09:01.540 --> 09:05.200
Oh, my God, that movie was so bad.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.000
Video games need more violence.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Is that how to get women into gaming?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
It's how to get men into gaming.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
More violence?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I'd like to see more titties in gaming.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Definitely.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Wait a minute.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Wait a minute.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
No, no, no.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.640
We need boobs and blood.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.640
Exactly.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.640
More guy-on-guy spanking.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.640
Wait, wait, wait.

09:19.640 --> 09:20.640
I'm...

09:20.640 --> 09:21.640
I'm done with that.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.640
Women who...

09:22.640 --> 09:24.640
Okay, you guys are telling me that...

09:24.640 --> 09:32.200
It's all about... it's all about Dead or Alive, Extreme, and Rumble Roses, and Rule of Roses

09:32.200 --> 09:33.520
candy.

09:33.520 --> 09:38.760
It's all about sequels to the Desperate Housewives PC game.

09:38.760 --> 09:43.320
Because if there's a skill that's vastly needed in this world, it's, you know, cooking and

09:43.320 --> 09:44.320
cleaning.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.760
All right, going to the chat room for some comments, Jared Jay says, Rob, you just crossed

09:47.760 --> 09:50.640
from respectable gay to stereotypical uber gay.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.680
Whatever, girlfriend, whatever.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
You don't know me.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.680
I'm down.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
Oh, snap, girl.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.600
No, that is so not me.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.800
That is so not me.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.800
I'm sorry.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.800
It's really not...

10:00.800 --> 10:02.600
That's so not you when you're sober.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.160
Yeah, when I'm drunk, maybe.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.160
Let's see.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.480
Gaming Nerd says, my parents watched it one day.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.480
It was pretty creepy.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.440
JV Mon says, I hate gay, straight, or taken.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.440
Let's see.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.040
Padrino says, what if the taken guy is gay?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.200
I don't know.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.200
I don't know.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.200
What if the taken guy is gay?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.400
Yeah, there was the gay guy that was taken on the show before.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.480
It's always a straight guy that's taken.

10:23.480 --> 10:26.760
But see, here's the thing, though, and even when we talked it over and we were saying,

10:26.760 --> 10:27.760
what if?

10:27.760 --> 10:28.920
You know, we were put in that situation.

10:28.920 --> 10:29.920
It's like, fuck that.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.560
Just do whatever it takes to win the vacation.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.560
We'll forgive you.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.560
It's like, that's...

10:34.560 --> 10:35.560
I don't know.

10:35.560 --> 10:40.880
All you need to do is grab their junk and see which one gets an erection unless you're

10:40.880 --> 10:41.880
really ugly.

10:41.880 --> 10:42.880
Then it doesn't work.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.880
You know?

10:43.880 --> 10:44.880
What if the taken one is in a bad relationship?

10:44.880 --> 10:45.880
I'm sorry.

10:45.880 --> 10:46.880
Were we a video game podcast?

10:46.880 --> 10:47.880
Because I just...

10:47.880 --> 10:48.880
I kind of forgot.

10:48.880 --> 10:49.880
All right.

10:49.880 --> 10:50.880
Well, then I'm...

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
I'm turning this car on.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.880
Games.

10:52.880 --> 10:53.880
Yeah.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.880
Jamie, how was your gaming week?

10:54.880 --> 10:55.880
What type of video games have you been playing this week?

10:55.880 --> 10:56.880
Games with boobs.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.880
Oh, Dead or Alive?

10:58.880 --> 10:59.880
No.

10:59.880 --> 11:00.880
I...

11:00.880 --> 11:04.920
My midterm is tomorrow for massage therapy, so I've actually been studying anatomy all

11:04.920 --> 11:08.760
week and playing...

11:08.760 --> 11:14.600
I did play a little bit of Cookie Mama just because I couldn't sleep.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.600
And I was going to borrow Rule of Rose from Chris, and she couldn't find her...

11:18.600 --> 11:19.600
Couldn't find the game.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
We found the case, but not the game.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
So, oh well.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.800
Oh, I did play...

11:22.800 --> 11:27.240
I actually did play a whole crap load of Creature from the Black Lagoon Pinball.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.760
A whole crap load of it.

11:29.760 --> 11:34.920
And oh, I also played Twilight Zone.

11:34.920 --> 11:39.840
Right now, though, we're fixing our Rocky and Bullinkle machine, and we got an Earthshaker,

11:39.840 --> 11:41.800
which is old-school cool pinball.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.440
Well, how are you fitting any more pinball machines in that?

11:44.440 --> 11:45.440
Aren't you going to be selling some?

11:45.440 --> 11:46.440
Oh, okay.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.440
We have nine pinball machines.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.440
No, you're not.

11:48.440 --> 11:55.200
Well, one of them's Will's, because we gave him, we sold him our Judge Dredd, and we wanted

11:55.200 --> 11:56.480
to get rid of the Johnny Mnemonic.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.680
I told Dan that if he gets rid of the Star Trek pinball, I would murder him in his sleep.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.480
So we're probably going to sell our Guns N' Roses machine.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.480
And maybe...

12:04.480 --> 12:05.480
Aww, that's sad.

12:05.480 --> 12:06.480
I love that machine.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.480
Well, then come over and play it before we sell it.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.480
I'm going to.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.940
Because I need money for a Doffy's.

12:09.940 --> 12:10.940
After the show, okay?

12:10.940 --> 12:11.940
And, and...

12:11.940 --> 12:12.940
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.240
You're going to charge me quarters?

12:14.240 --> 12:15.240
No.

12:15.240 --> 12:23.480
We need to sell them so that I can use the money from Dan's pinball machines, mine.

12:23.480 --> 12:28.480
Alpha Canagram says, oh snap, Rocky and Bullinkle, oh snap.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.560
I love Rocky and Bullinkle, but well, the problem with our Rocky and Bullinkle machine

12:31.560 --> 12:37.240
is that we need a new, a new board for it, for a new, for the ROM set.

12:37.240 --> 12:41.440
And right now the board's like, I'm going to be broken for a while and, you know, paying

12:41.440 --> 12:42.440
for school.

12:42.440 --> 12:46.280
I've got to decide what's more important, my education or pinball, which is really hard

12:46.280 --> 12:48.120
choice, but you know.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.600
Mike W says, don't worry, Mama will fix it.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.880
Cookie Mama reference, of course.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.880
Insert ellipse here.

12:55.880 --> 12:56.880
Okay, thanks, bye.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.680
You need to have Sugar Mama the game.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.880
Yeah, I played that.

13:02.880 --> 13:03.880
Wow.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.320
Loki, how was your gaming week?

13:06.320 --> 13:07.320
My gaming week was good.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.800
I played more of the Crackdown demo, again.

13:09.800 --> 13:13.480
I found the grenade launcher, which, you know, makes the game a lot more fun.

13:13.480 --> 13:17.680
And then, what else did I do?

13:17.680 --> 13:23.040
I tried, oh, I played a little bit of, oh God, what the hell is that crappy PopCap game?

13:23.040 --> 13:27.840
I don't know, some crappy PopCap game that's on live.

13:27.840 --> 13:32.200
And yeah, I don't know, I just, trying to get you even points.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.400
I got bored real quick, so.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.560
And then, let's see, played more Resistance.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.840
I'm actually playing it the second time through, and you get some more weapons, so it's like

13:43.840 --> 13:48.040
mildly fun, more fun, I guess.

13:48.040 --> 13:53.920
And then, actually, ironically enough, we were over at my sister's house yesterday,

13:53.920 --> 14:00.400
and once we got done playing board games, they popped in Driver 3, because they're borrowing

14:00.400 --> 14:02.400
my PlayStation 2 right now.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.440
And apparently, her and her boyfriend, their favorite thing to do now is to stay up late

14:06.440 --> 14:10.760
at night playing this game, just watching how crappy the game is.

14:10.760 --> 14:15.520
And it's so bad that we were actually watching my sister play it, and we knew we would watch

14:15.520 --> 14:19.320
a replay of it, and the replay wasn't doing what she did in the game.

14:19.320 --> 14:24.500
The replay actually glitched out, and it was, it looked like we were watching like the Discovery

14:24.500 --> 14:29.440
Channel, like a video of some lizard or something, because the character kept ducking and popping

14:29.440 --> 14:33.120
back up and stuff and running around, and it ended up in the water somehow.

14:33.120 --> 14:37.960
And there was actually another time that she was driving, and this car falls, like it looks

14:37.960 --> 14:41.800
like it drove off the top of a roof of a building and just like crashed into this background

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
all of a sudden.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.200
I was like, what the fuck is this?

14:45.200 --> 14:49.880
It was just so retarded, so I have to play more Driver 3 now, because I forgot how crappy

14:49.880 --> 14:55.720
that game is, and probably now it's like dirt cheap, so maybe pick up an actual copy of

14:55.720 --> 15:01.500
it instead of a pirated copy on my PlayStation 2 hard drive.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.640
And then play it on the PlayStation 3.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.160
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.480
Looking forward to playing some new stuff this week, hopefully.

15:11.480 --> 15:17.120
Jared Jay says, oh god, I still can't believe I paid $50 for Driver 3 back in the day.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.120
And you know what?

15:18.120 --> 15:24.840
I can't believe I paid $50 for a game I played a little bit this week, Fusion Frenzy 2.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.040
I picked up this game because the demo was kind of fun, and I thought, oh well, you know,

15:28.040 --> 15:31.100
I love those little mini games, this will be, you know, a good time.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.680
The best way I can describe this game is unpolished.

15:33.680 --> 15:38.880
I mean, it's just, it feels sloppy, like all these little cutscenes are bleh, and the games

15:38.880 --> 15:41.120
all look the same, and it's so bland.

15:41.120 --> 15:45.600
How could a game with 40 mini games, that's basically think Mario Party without the big

15:45.600 --> 15:47.860
board, be so frickin' bland?

15:47.860 --> 15:48.860
But it is.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.320
I was just so bored.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.480
And then I'm thinking, like, Fusion Frenzy 1 really wasn't anything to write home about,

15:53.480 --> 15:54.480
was it?

15:54.480 --> 15:55.480
Eddie, you watched me play this game, right?

15:55.480 --> 15:57.520
Yeah, I just, I came over like an hour ago, and Rob was playing it.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.200
It's just, it's really generic.

15:59.200 --> 16:04.600
I mean, it looks like I revamped the graphics from, like, F-Zero on GameCube, and just like,

16:04.600 --> 16:05.960
you know, they keep looping the same animation through.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.240
Which is amazing, because the developers are completely different.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.800
Yeah, but yeah, it, to me, had the same look to it, and it was just kind of generic, and

16:11.800 --> 16:14.320
like, all the different, there's, the characters are all the same, it's just they're different

16:14.320 --> 16:17.840
colors, and they use the same animation loops, like, over and over again, instead of actually,

16:17.840 --> 16:21.720
like, having new cutscenes, and it's just, yeah, I just think they rush through it.

16:21.720 --> 16:26.960
So I do not recommend Fusion Frenzy 2, unless you want easy achievement points.

16:26.960 --> 16:30.760
Go rent it, because you can get through the achievements pretty easy, as I understand

16:30.760 --> 16:31.760
it.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.720
I racked up 75 pretty quickly, just playing through it once, and it wasn't anything that

16:34.720 --> 16:37.140
difficult, so, yawn.

16:37.140 --> 16:41.420
And I know we're going to talk later in the show about the rewards program, but it's,

16:41.420 --> 16:45.900
for those of you guys that are hoping to get this as a reward, you might find that they're

16:45.900 --> 16:50.480
just trying to unload the extra copies they're bound to have, because this game is not fun.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.480
I'm sorry.

16:51.480 --> 16:56.480
Well, here's the thing, like, thank God that the Halo beta wasn't included with this game.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.160
Good point.

16:59.160 --> 17:04.000
Root Beer Tapper's another game I played this week on Xbox Live Arcade, and I love the old

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
school Tapper.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.280
You know, I know a lot of people have been giving Microsoft some shit for putting up

17:08.280 --> 17:13.320
all these, like, old classic video games up on Xbox Live recently, but actually the ones

17:13.320 --> 17:16.600
that they put up recently, like Rally-X and Root Beer Tapper, I actually remember from

17:16.600 --> 17:17.960
my childhood and love.

17:17.960 --> 17:23.000
So the only problem with Root Beer Tapper is that they really didn't do much to it.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.620
They put a co-op and competitive mode in it, but it's stupid.

17:27.620 --> 17:30.560
You don't see the other player on your screen at all.

17:30.560 --> 17:35.960
All you see is, you see their score and how they're progressing in the game.

17:35.960 --> 17:36.960
That's it.

17:36.960 --> 17:41.960
So it doesn't lend itself very much to a co-op or, and they didn't even redo the graphics

17:41.960 --> 17:46.480
or anything, so, I mean, I guess it's good that it's only $5, which is the cheapest that

17:46.480 --> 17:51.120
Microsoft will charge any game, but expect this game to be the free toss-in on a lot

17:51.120 --> 17:56.520
of upcoming bundle stuff like Xbox Live cards and things, because I just, I don't think

17:56.520 --> 18:01.520
it's, as much as I love Root Beer Tapper, it didn't get the same treatment a lot of

18:01.520 --> 18:04.840
the other games did, therefore, I don't think it's as good of a value, and it pains me to

18:04.840 --> 18:05.840
say that.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.600
What's, I was just, you mentioned that it's $5 is the cheapest, that's how it is on the

18:08.600 --> 18:11.800
Virtual Console and Nintendo, what is with that, I mean, to me, that's still kind of

18:11.800 --> 18:16.120
expensive for a game that, like, came out, like, 20 years ago, you know, they made their

18:16.120 --> 18:19.040
money on it, they're just selling the bits over the internet, it's just, it's kind of

18:19.040 --> 18:20.040
weird to me.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.440
A lot of people have been making the same complaints you have, does a game like, I don't

18:23.440 --> 18:27.120
know, Tennis, and I'm not talking Wii Sports Tennis, I'm talking old-school 8-bit Tennis,

18:27.120 --> 18:31.680
does this game like Tennis really justify the same price as a game like Super Mario

18:31.680 --> 18:32.680
Brothers?

18:32.680 --> 18:36.120
Especially when I can go buy, like, a Nintendo for pretty cheap and buy the cartridges for

18:36.120 --> 18:42.680
like 50 cents or less, I mean, it's like, or even if you want to go the illegal route,

18:42.680 --> 18:48.040
download the ROM, which takes, like, a split second to download because it's really super

18:48.040 --> 18:54.920
tiny, you know, only a few kilobytes, and it's like, wow, all this time that you, and

18:54.920 --> 18:59.440
you didn't, they didn't add, like, multiplayer, no, if they added multiplayer over, you know,

18:59.440 --> 19:03.040
their online network, oh, that's right, they don't have an online network, they just, you

19:03.040 --> 19:08.200
know, Wii Connect 24, which just lets me know when there's a message to download, it doesn't

19:08.200 --> 19:11.320
actually download the message.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.680
Comments from our chat room, Jeremy Todd 1 says, I hate Root Beer Tapper, but of course,

19:14.680 --> 19:18.000
I didn't play it a long time ago, so that nostalgia factor isn't there, but whatever,

19:18.000 --> 19:19.800
I still think the game sucks.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.580
Brad from Pod Culture says, I've been playing the hell out of Root Beer Tapper, fun times,

19:23.580 --> 19:28.360
so differing opinions, I guess download the demo, see if it's something you like, so there

19:28.360 --> 19:29.360
you go.

19:29.360 --> 19:34.200
Alright, yeah, there's a chat room brawl breaking out over Root Beer Tapper, in fact, I think

19:34.200 --> 19:36.280
some Root Beer glasses have just been shattered.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.920
Why can't it just be Tapper with the beer?

19:38.920 --> 19:42.920
Because it was Budweiser, and that was sponsored, and so you got product placement in there,

19:42.920 --> 19:46.340
it's like why you couldn't do Mike Tyson's Punch-Out now, right?

19:46.340 --> 19:47.340
Same type of thing.

19:47.340 --> 19:50.080
Because he bit people's ears off, that's why he can't.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.080
Yeah, he's a cannibal.

19:51.080 --> 19:56.880
Yeah, actually, Nintendo is going to be re-skinning Punch-Out, and it's going to be Mike Tyson's

19:56.880 --> 20:01.680
Ear-Biting and Women-Raping, actually is going to be coming out to the Wii Virtual Console,

20:01.680 --> 20:03.300
for only $5, Eddie!

20:03.300 --> 20:07.920
It's going to play like Oonga Boonga.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.880
Get the Wii-mote and just like, thrust it in there.

20:10.880 --> 20:16.360
For those that don't know what Oonga Boonga is, just don't look it up, just don't research

20:16.360 --> 20:17.680
it, don't look it up on Wikipedia.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.080
You should totally see it.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.080
Oh man, Loki.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.840
You can address those cards and letters to loki at orangelonestrader.com.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.720
It's the finger up the ass for a tickets game.

20:25.720 --> 20:30.480
Why can't we have ticket games like that over here, that'd be hilarious.

20:30.480 --> 20:35.360
Let's see, let's go over and check in with Rice Princess and Casper the Gay, and see

20:35.360 --> 20:39.140
if there's anything they've been playing this week, real quick.

20:39.140 --> 20:44.560
I've been playing Oonga Booga, but like, on my own body, with someone else, but I don't

20:44.560 --> 20:48.680
want to spend tickets, I'm just like, ooh, awesome, keep playing.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.680
You're disgusting.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.000
Eddie, what have you been playing this week?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
I've been playing!

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Okay, what?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Hat sex!

20:55.000 --> 21:00.520
Are you guys drunk on this program tonight?

21:00.520 --> 21:01.520
They're wearing hats.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.640
I know this is radio, maybe we can take some pictures of both of them, but they're wearing

21:04.640 --> 21:05.640
hats.

21:05.640 --> 21:10.920
And like, Rice Princess is wearing a freakin' shamrock hat, that's like not even March yet.

21:10.920 --> 21:15.400
Eddie, Casper the Gay, what have you been playing?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.760
Yeah, big surprise, I downloaded Link the Bass when it came out on Virtual Console,

21:18.760 --> 21:21.760
but I was kind of mad, I was like, that was $8, I was like, holy crap, but I was like,

21:21.760 --> 21:24.720
you know, I haven't played that game in like 10 years, I should play it, but I mean, it's

21:24.720 --> 21:28.120
like, it's cool, I love the old school stuff, but you know, it takes like 10 minutes now

21:28.120 --> 21:31.200
to get all three pendants at the beginning, it's like, which is still fun though, I mean,

21:31.200 --> 21:35.440
it's good old school stuff, but yeah, if Nintendo's listening, bring down your prices, I mean,

21:35.440 --> 21:38.400
it's like, $2 for an NES game would not be too low.

21:38.400 --> 21:42.840
Yes, actually, all of Nintendo is listening to this program, Reggie Fils-Aime is a very

21:42.840 --> 21:43.840
loyal listener.

21:43.840 --> 21:44.840
Yeah, pretty much.

21:44.840 --> 21:45.840
Sure.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.460
Oh, I forgot, I've been playing Super Mario World.

21:48.460 --> 21:53.000
I beat it, I beat Super Mario World, because I'm awesome, I used Star World to get there

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
quickly.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Hey, Rob, you know, I've beaten Super Mario World 2.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Hey, Jamie, kiss my ass.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.720
No, I don't know where that's been.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.720
I'll help you out there, um.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.240
You guys are filthy.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.440
It's a tag, bonk.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.440
All right, um.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.360
You're being so brown, because, you know, it has to do with your butt, I guess, I don't

22:12.360 --> 22:13.360
know.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.360
Oh my god!

22:14.360 --> 22:15.360
I like your shirt.

22:15.360 --> 22:19.360
We watched the bullshit episode about the ass last night.

22:19.360 --> 22:20.360
Video games, anybody?

22:20.360 --> 22:21.360
Has anybody played them?

22:21.360 --> 22:25.280
I'm trying to segue into video games again by commenting on your shirt.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.280
Oh, sure, yes.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.280
It's a lovely shirt.

22:27.280 --> 22:30.400
I am, I'm wearing a very hot tanooki shirt, I'm gonna pose for the camera right now, look

22:30.400 --> 22:32.360
at me, I'm all sexy, I'm, you know, god damn it.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.320
You can't even see the tanooki when you do that, Rob, move your fucking microphone.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.720
This is great radio, by the way.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.200
No, it's not at all.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.200
It's never been good.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.520
We were just gonna mention my shirt, yes, I have a tanooki Mario in my shirt.

22:42.520 --> 22:46.200
You know, I got accosted by a stranger in Radio Shack today, it was like, no, seriously,

22:46.200 --> 22:52.600
this is how it went, dude, dude, that's an awesome shirt, dude, that is an awesome shirt.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.000
Did you walk into the fraternity in Radio Shack or something?

22:55.000 --> 22:58.960
Apparently so, because the guy's like, dude, that shirt is awesome, dude, I just got a

22:58.960 --> 23:05.040
wee today, I got a wee at Target, I swear to god, I'm not making this up, and then the

23:05.040 --> 23:10.360
woman behind the counter was like, um, was that the Mario where you, like, killed things

23:10.360 --> 23:12.360
with your tail?

23:12.360 --> 23:18.080
Because I'm not sure, because I've been sitting behind here all day doing nothing, and it's

23:18.080 --> 23:20.960
starting to get my brain, because nobody shops at Radio Shack.

23:20.960 --> 23:21.960
Rob.

23:21.960 --> 23:22.960
What?

23:22.960 --> 23:26.120
Oh, more pictures, I feel like a- Do you want a satellite TV?

23:26.120 --> 23:29.440
I feel like Anna Nicole Smith, only alive, this is nice.

23:29.440 --> 23:34.240
I'm taking a picture of Rob's shirt, one, two, five.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.240
Ah, thank you.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.240
It's blurry, oh well.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.160
All right, anyway, let's get- And I'm not uploading it either.

23:39.160 --> 23:43.280
Let's get into some actual gaming news, because we don't really have any housekeeping tonight.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.280
Visit our Myspace- I do.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.280
Oh, you have some housekeeping?

23:45.280 --> 23:46.280
What do you want to say?

23:46.280 --> 23:50.080
Well, just that you need some housekeeping.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.080
Shut up.

23:51.080 --> 23:55.640
Loki, save this show with some awesome exclusives, that would be, like, the best thing ever,

23:55.640 --> 23:59.160
if you could, like, give us some video game news no one's heard yet.

23:59.160 --> 24:04.320
How about the entire lineup for Xbox 360 from Microsoft this year, that'd be great.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.320
How about that?

24:05.320 --> 24:12.360
Let's start off, then, with Blue Dragon, which has been announced now for July 11th, so look

24:12.360 --> 24:13.520
forward to that.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.480
Project Silpheed on the 360.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.480
Awesome.

24:17.480 --> 24:27.080
For May 16th, Tenchu Z coming out June 12th, Two Human also May 16th, Mass Effect coming

24:27.080 --> 24:35.280
out May 30th, Shadowrun June 13th, Forza 2 is slated for May 16th as well, man, that's

24:35.280 --> 24:39.480
going to be a pretty big day, because I know Halo 3 is set around that time, too.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.640
I'm sure some of this stuff is going to move, but.

24:42.640 --> 24:46.400
And then on top of all those games we have coming out, of course, they're going to be

24:46.400 --> 24:51.080
having a 4,000 point live card coming out in April, so if you didn't really want to

24:51.080 --> 24:56.280
spend $20 on live points at the store, now you can spend $40 on live points at the store,

24:56.280 --> 24:59.360
or actually, no, that's more than $50, I'm sorry.

24:59.360 --> 25:02.720
I was kind of wondering at first why they would be doing this, but then I think the

25:02.720 --> 25:06.360
movie rentals, you know, you can spend a lot of points really quickly on the movie rentals,

25:06.360 --> 25:09.520
so folks that are downloading the HD movies, I can see.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.280
Those cards sell well because people buy them as gifts, so.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.280
I can see that.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.760
They're like iTunes cards.

25:14.760 --> 25:15.760
Exactly.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.920
So, that's going to be pretty cool.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.840
Tetris Evolution is actually coming out.

25:19.840 --> 25:23.760
Remember, Tetris Grandmaster was one of the launch titles in Japan, now it's making it

25:23.760 --> 25:24.760
over here.

25:24.760 --> 25:31.080
This 360 game I've seen, this is a retail price point of $29.99 when it's coming out

25:31.080 --> 25:32.080
in March.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.080
Good job.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.480
A moment of applause, please, for this.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.360
Applause, please.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.360
Low price points are awesome.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.360
That was the wrong one-handed clap.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.360
I've got some bad news, though.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.840
That doesn't sound one-handed clapping.

25:42.840 --> 25:49.640
Mario Party 8 has been delayed to June, or not June, May 15th, so I don't know.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.640
How do you know this?

25:50.640 --> 25:53.120
This is groundbreaking news.

25:53.120 --> 25:59.960
Because us distributors talk to the publishers on a daily basis, so they will give us updates

25:59.960 --> 26:04.600
to dates all the time, and even usually before press releases go out we get announcements

26:04.600 --> 26:09.800
for stuff that hasn't been announced yet, or maybe announced at certain retail spots

26:09.800 --> 26:12.800
but no one's paying attention.

26:12.800 --> 26:13.800
Don't worry, guys.

26:13.800 --> 26:18.560
You can play Fusion Frenzy 2 in the meantime and then poop on it because it's bad.

26:18.560 --> 26:19.840
Because you had to play Fusion Frenzy.

26:19.840 --> 26:25.200
Well, to be honest, though, most of the Wii games coming out now have party games in them.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.440
I know Sonic the Hedgehog, the brand new one, Sonic and the Secret Rings, has actually party

26:29.440 --> 26:30.440
games in it as well.

26:30.440 --> 26:31.440
They look kind of fun.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.440
Wait.

26:32.440 --> 26:33.440
I have a question.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.440
Yes.

26:34.440 --> 26:35.440
Rice Princess has a question.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.440
Yes.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.440
Are the Secret Rings cock rings?

26:37.440 --> 26:38.440
Low key.

26:38.440 --> 26:46.600
And then finally, the remakes, Final Fantasy I and II, are slated for the PSP June 13th.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.600
That's huge.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.880
So that'll be pretty nice as well.

26:49.880 --> 26:50.880
Wow.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.760
Those are some huge dates you're giving us there.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.040
Good job, Low Key.

26:54.040 --> 26:57.480
So I'm just glad to see that some actual games are coming out.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.960
I'm not sure if Microsoft's going to be stacking that many games in May.

27:00.960 --> 27:06.560
They might try to shuffle stuff around a little bit to kind of spread out the fun, but lots

27:06.560 --> 27:09.160
of good stuff for the summer.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.160
Awesome.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.640
Did you just paste that picture of my shirt?

27:13.640 --> 27:14.640
Yes, I did.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.640
Oh my gosh.

27:15.640 --> 27:16.640
Oh wow.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.000
And you can see my big fat stomach in there.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
That's very nice.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Good job.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.260
I got a cool shirt today.

27:23.260 --> 27:26.880
Some of the perks of being in our chat room live when the show is going on Sunday at 6

27:26.880 --> 27:27.880
o'clock.

27:27.880 --> 27:28.880
What'd you get?

27:28.880 --> 27:29.880
This is Captain America for President.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.400
I love Captain America.

27:32.400 --> 27:36.160
I want a shirt that says Reggie Fils-Aime for President, because he would regulate.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.160
I'd go for Captain America.

27:37.160 --> 27:38.560
And then like Link could be Vice President.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.000
That would be awesome.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
What?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
What?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.040
Rice Princess, you remember the rule in the studio is if you say something, you have to

27:45.040 --> 27:46.040
say it in a mic.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.040
Yeah, damn it.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.040
Rob, I hate you.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.040
I've hated you for years.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.040
Oh, thank you.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.040
I love you too.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.040
Aww.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.040
Aww.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.040
Don't really touch me, Rob.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.200
What the hell is wrong with the program tonight?

27:56.200 --> 27:57.200
I don't know.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.680
Oh, Fireboma says Sky needs to lose a good 200 pounds.

28:00.680 --> 28:01.680
Who?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.680
In related news, Fireboma.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.680
No, no, no.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.680
Who?

28:04.680 --> 28:05.680
Fireboma.

28:05.680 --> 28:06.680
Fireboma, out.

28:06.680 --> 28:10.800
In related news, Fireboma just got kicked from chat.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.800
There you go.

28:12.800 --> 28:13.800
Yay.

28:13.800 --> 28:14.800
Fireboma, you're out.

28:14.800 --> 28:15.800
Yeah.

28:15.800 --> 28:19.040
If you come back in, Fireboma, I'm going to sit on you.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.360
For those who have never seen Rob, he's like the skinniest man ever.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.360
What?

28:23.360 --> 28:29.640
The only way your ass would weight 500 pounds is if you wore a metal diaper and you pooped

28:29.640 --> 28:30.640
in it.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.960
Anyway, God, what is wrong with this program tonight?

28:32.960 --> 28:33.960
Shit.

28:33.960 --> 28:34.960
Pure shit.

28:34.960 --> 28:40.680
No, I was just saying that I saw a really cute shirt that was caps lock, cruise control

28:40.680 --> 28:44.240
for awesome, and I really want that shirt a lot.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.240
What is that a reference to?

28:45.240 --> 28:46.240
I don't even get it.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.240
Do you know what caps lock is?

28:47.240 --> 28:50.920
Well, I know what the caps lock is, but- It's cruise control for awesome.

28:50.920 --> 28:51.920
Hello.

28:51.920 --> 28:52.920
You don't get it?

28:52.920 --> 28:57.600
I saw this other one where the front says ding and on the back it says grats.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.040
I really want that one.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.040
That one I get.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.040
Yeah.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.040
You would because you're a nerd.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.040
Yeah.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.040
I've been playing lots of World of Warcraft this week, by the way.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.040
So have I.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.040
All right.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.040
Anyhow.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.440
Boo.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.680
Let's go into some other news.

29:12.680 --> 29:16.840
I promised last week we would have some news on the Alice movie.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.920
This would be American McGee's Alice, as you know, being made into a movie.

29:19.920 --> 29:25.200
Now, I apologize to the source because I don't think I'm supposed to name the source, but

29:25.200 --> 29:29.000
if you want it to be named, then I apologize, but this information is coming from a very

29:29.000 --> 29:32.760
trusted source of Orange Lounge Radio, somebody I've been working with for a while who just

29:32.760 --> 29:34.320
happened to come across this.

29:34.320 --> 29:39.360
I can't really say how, but got to read the script, the current script as it is for Alice.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.120
Now keep in mind, these things change all the time.

29:42.120 --> 29:46.600
So I know a lot of folks are going to sit out there and go, yeah, right, OLR is full

29:46.600 --> 29:47.600
of it.

29:47.600 --> 29:52.080
I reasonably believe this is accurate, the way the movie stands today.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.160
It doesn't sound like BS.

29:53.160 --> 29:57.080
It sounds pretty legit, but it might change by the time the movie comes out.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.840
I'm curious what you guys think of this.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.880
So here, I'm going to read from this, and I want to say thanks again to our source.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.360
So I'm going to keep anonymous, but if you want me to name you, let me know.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.360
I'll name you next week.

30:06.360 --> 30:11.080
Alice as a child is confronted by her parents due to her uncontrollable fascination with

30:11.080 --> 30:12.080
Wonderland.

30:12.080 --> 30:15.960
Against Alice's protest that Wonderland exists, Alice's father takes down possibly

30:15.960 --> 30:20.120
anything in her room that would insinuate any thought related to Wonderland.

30:20.120 --> 30:24.180
Later that night, the house is burned down, and the only survivor found is Alice, splattered

30:24.180 --> 30:26.240
with blood on her body.

30:26.240 --> 30:29.400
Forward to the future, Alice is staying in a mental institution.

30:29.400 --> 30:35.680
An MD, Dr. Hatfield, is interested in Alice and transfers her to another institution,

30:35.680 --> 30:39.120
even though doctors tell Hatfield that Alice is impossible to cure.

30:39.120 --> 30:42.680
Alice then begins a new treatment at the new institution, which is looking more and more

30:42.680 --> 30:44.000
abnormal to Alice.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.400
Alice's old meds are no longer given to her.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.600
The other patients are deranged, but one sane doctor named Doyle seems to be the only

30:50.600 --> 30:54.560
sane one, and Alice pleads to him for help as she claims she's not who or what she

30:54.560 --> 30:55.560
really is.

30:55.560 --> 31:01.360
Alice's treatments are getting worser and crueler and gets wind of Hatfield's surgeries.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.640
After escaping a scuffle from getting into her first surgery, she follows a rabbit she

31:05.640 --> 31:09.240
barely saw in the middle of her struggle and follows it into you-know-where.

31:09.240 --> 31:14.280
Apparently, there were some notes on the script as well, some possible movies, because some

31:14.280 --> 31:18.760
movie names were written on here, some movies that this could be influenced from.

31:18.760 --> 31:24.360
12 Monkeys, 7, Perfect Storm, Pan's Labyrinth, Jacob's Ladder, What Dreams May Come, Lord

31:24.360 --> 31:28.880
of the Rings, and then some bands were written on there as well, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry,

31:28.880 --> 31:34.760
Butthole Surfers, specifically Chris Vrenna of Nine Inch Nails as well, Electronic Industrial

31:34.760 --> 31:40.000
Hip Hop Music, and then this is the movie genre, Psycho Horror Action.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.480
So what do you think?

31:41.480 --> 31:42.600
Sounds kind of neat?

31:42.600 --> 31:43.600
Sounds true to the game?

31:43.600 --> 31:44.600
What do you think?

31:44.600 --> 31:45.600
It sounds neat.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.960
I haven't played the game, but it sounds neat.

31:46.960 --> 31:49.520
I did years ago, but I don't remember it very well.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.000
I watched a speed run of the game.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Did you?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
It could be okay.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Yeah, so it sounds like it could be interesting.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.440
Mention a movie I saw today.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.440
What's that?

31:58.440 --> 31:59.440
I saw Pan's Labyrinth today.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.440
Oh, how was that?

32:00.440 --> 32:01.600
Did you like that?

32:01.600 --> 32:03.360
My roommate's been raving about that.

32:03.360 --> 32:08.600
I didn't know if I should cry or be happy, so I just went, oh, it was really good.

32:08.600 --> 32:09.600
Interesting.

32:09.600 --> 32:10.600
Okay.

32:10.600 --> 32:11.600
Let's see.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.600
I'm going...

32:12.600 --> 32:13.600
Except the original title wasn't even Pan's Labyrinth.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.200
I don't know why they called it that.

32:16.200 --> 32:20.680
The Rob D says Alice then gets treatment from a Dr. House, making reference to the TV show,

32:20.680 --> 32:21.680
I guess.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.400
JV Mon says, this sounds awesome.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.680
So it could be very interesting.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.720
Padrino says, I do believe it can be real since the scripts have to make the rounds.

32:28.720 --> 32:32.600
I believe it's real too, but I think, as most scripts do, it's probably going to change

32:32.600 --> 32:34.120
a bunch before we see the final product.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.120
But there you have it.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.840
Your first look into what the Alice movie has in store.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.080
All right.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.840
So how about some other news circulating the internet this week?

32:42.840 --> 32:47.520
Well, there's a little bit of happiness going on.

32:47.520 --> 32:54.520
For all of us who have been begging and pleading for Nintendo to do a kitty-kitty version of

32:54.520 --> 32:57.360
Nintendogs, well, somebody else is doing it.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.080
Crave is putting out Purr Pals for the DS.

33:00.080 --> 33:05.520
You can choose 40 breeds of kitties, and pet them, and love them, and call them George,

33:05.520 --> 33:12.160
and you can raise them, you know.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.280
It's funny this mentions modifying cat behavior.

33:14.280 --> 33:15.280
No.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.080
You just call them modified cats.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.080
Cats modify your behavior.

33:18.080 --> 33:22.280
Am I the only one disappointed that they did not call this Pussy Pals?

33:22.280 --> 33:25.000
Yes, you are.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.080
I love that this article put up a cat macro, though.

33:28.080 --> 33:31.840
It says, where is your god now?

33:31.840 --> 33:34.200
Are you going to be picking up Purr Pals?

33:34.200 --> 33:35.200
Probably.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.200
Can it do Nintendogs justice?

33:36.200 --> 33:37.200
Because, just, just.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.920
It's a really different graphical style.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.920
What's a kitty?

33:39.920 --> 33:42.280
The graphical style is totally different from, like, a Nintendogs.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.560
It's not realistic cats.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.120
It's like cartoony alien cats.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.120
Well, then never mind.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.260
They have a video of it on iGn.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.680
They have a video of it on other sites?

33:49.680 --> 33:51.800
I usually avoid iGn, like, the plague, though.

33:51.800 --> 33:52.800
You know.

33:52.800 --> 33:56.240
Except, except I got Matthew Brando with blood.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.240
They do have a lot of videos.

33:57.240 --> 34:01.680
You know, there was a cats game that's already been out on the DS that you can do the exact

34:01.680 --> 34:02.680
same thing.

34:02.680 --> 34:06.480
It's called Cats with a Z at the end, you know, because they're extreme.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.480
I don't know.

34:07.480 --> 34:08.480
They do a dogs one, too.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.320
Yeah, they have the dogs, horses, hamsters.

34:10.320 --> 34:17.280
Wait, do these cats, like, go base jumping and, like, extreme snowboarding and stuff?

34:17.280 --> 34:18.480
They're hardcore cats.

34:18.480 --> 34:24.040
They do crystal meth and go to raves.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.840
Wow.

34:26.840 --> 34:30.240
They should have it, like, you know, they should have it where the cats actually start

34:30.240 --> 34:32.520
scratching the DS, and you're like, what the fuck?

34:32.520 --> 34:35.720
Why is there a throw up in my DS, you know, just stuff like that.

34:35.720 --> 34:40.200
They should hack up hairballs and then poo on your, you know, your bathroom rug.

34:40.200 --> 34:44.960
Of course, the chat room is all clamoring out in unison for Love Hamster, which was

34:44.960 --> 34:45.960
a game we talked about.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.820
Hamster does not have a P in it.

34:47.820 --> 34:51.240
The Rob D says, you're just an intense pussy, Rob.

34:51.240 --> 34:56.920
Anyway, speaking of crap, Codemasters' last Bubble Bobble game, Bubble Bobble Revolution,

34:56.920 --> 34:59.600
was crap because you couldn't pass level 30.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.120
What kind of a game is that?

35:01.120 --> 35:06.680
Well, they're going back and recalling them so you can actually send it into Codemasters

35:06.680 --> 35:13.080
and get a brand new copy that'll be fixed, and you can actually pass level 30.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.280
That's good to know.

35:14.280 --> 35:18.440
So if you happen to be unfortunate enough to have bought this game and haven't sold

35:18.440 --> 35:23.840
it back yet, you may want to seek a better copy from Codemasters.

35:23.840 --> 35:28.200
I think it would be great if there were only 31 levels, so they like send it in and it's

35:28.200 --> 35:33.800
only one more level, and it's like, oh, okay.

35:33.800 --> 35:34.800
Gotcha.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.800
Wow.

35:35.800 --> 35:46.440
Yeah, and that's the same, GS68 has the same thing in chat, but can you pass level 31?

35:46.440 --> 35:47.440
Don't know.

35:47.440 --> 35:48.440
What do you think, guys?

35:48.440 --> 35:54.040
Now, do we ease up on the folks behind Bubble Bobble for the DS and not make any more level

35:54.040 --> 35:55.040
30 jokes?

35:55.040 --> 35:56.040
No.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.760
You know what I think it really was?

35:57.760 --> 36:01.800
I think they just didn't finish it on time, so they purposely made it so you couldn't

36:01.800 --> 36:05.520
pass 30, and so that gave them more time to create more levels and stuff.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.080
And they're like, yeah, now we've fixed it.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.400
Yeah, now you can totally get past level 30.

36:10.400 --> 36:14.760
I've read an interesting theory about that this is just a reflection of the general laziness

36:14.760 --> 36:19.880
in QA and testing, because what the 360 and other next-gen systems have allowed you to

36:19.880 --> 36:24.640
do with patching, because companies are too spoiled now with the whole patching thing.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.040
If bugs are discovered, eh, they can go back and patch it.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.920
But the problem is you can't really patch a DS game without doing a massive recall.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.800
So I mean, is this maybe why this happened?

36:34.800 --> 36:35.800
Possibly.

36:35.800 --> 36:41.440
I mean, they obviously didn't play test it, because if, you know, oh, I can't pass level

36:41.440 --> 36:42.440
30.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.440
I just must suck.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.880
I mean, other people would be better than I am.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.600
All right.

36:48.600 --> 36:54.040
Well moving on into other news, speaking of big letdowns, you might remember we even got

36:54.040 --> 36:55.900
a call on this last week.

36:55.900 --> 36:59.760
Somebody had said, hey, what do you think Konami's big announcement is?

36:59.760 --> 37:03.860
Because remember we gave the rundown on Konami Gamer's Day last week, right, about the show

37:03.860 --> 37:05.240
and all the games we played.

37:05.240 --> 37:09.560
But Konami had put on their site, hey, boys and girls, stay tuned until Monday, because

37:09.560 --> 37:13.180
we got some big shit, yo, that we're going to be laying down.

37:13.180 --> 37:14.180
What was it?

37:14.180 --> 37:15.180
I know what it is.

37:15.180 --> 37:16.180
What?

37:16.180 --> 37:18.000
They released a controller that you could play Frogger on.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.040
No, that's actually old news.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.000
I forgot to mention that during my gaming week.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.120
I think that they released it, somebody had diarrhea when they went out.

37:25.120 --> 37:30.080
Actually, I forgot to mention that Rice Princess and Casper the Gay and Xtaphir all got me

37:30.080 --> 37:32.460
this little USB Frogger controller.

37:32.460 --> 37:35.240
And all you have to do is plug it into the USB port and it installs the game and you

37:35.240 --> 37:36.240
can play it.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.520
And I'm here to tell you, the game sucks.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.520
Balls.

37:39.520 --> 37:44.720
Horrible, horrible, sloppy, wrinkly balls is what this game sucks.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.720
It's horrid.

37:45.720 --> 37:46.720
Ew.

37:46.720 --> 37:47.720
That's gross.

37:47.720 --> 37:51.800
And I spent more time staring at the now loading screen than I did actually playing the game.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.560
Well, that's half the fun.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.480
Was this like on clearance?

37:55.480 --> 37:56.480
No.

37:56.480 --> 37:57.480
Yeah, meaning yes.

37:57.480 --> 37:58.480
Not.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.480
How many dollars am I holding up?

38:00.480 --> 38:01.480
Yes.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.840
Was it seriously four bucks?

38:03.840 --> 38:04.840
Wow.

38:04.840 --> 38:05.840
It might be worth four bucks.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.760
Not to make fun of Konami or anything, but I know.

38:08.760 --> 38:09.760
Hey, look.

38:09.760 --> 38:13.480
We gave glowing reviews of Gamers' Day last week, so I think I can say this shitty little

38:13.480 --> 38:15.000
four dollar thing sucks, okay?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.720
They're not going to cry.

38:16.720 --> 38:22.880
Do you remember the first Gamers' Day we went to and even the second, like that summer thing,

38:22.880 --> 38:28.480
that they had like a whole booth set up that they'd show you how to use the USB key thing?

38:28.480 --> 38:32.840
I'm like, you fucking just plug it into a USB port.

38:32.840 --> 38:33.840
How hard is that?

38:33.840 --> 38:36.360
Uh, I can't get it in there right.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.360
What the hell?

38:37.360 --> 38:40.640
I mean, literally you just plug it in and it goes.

38:40.640 --> 38:44.560
I mean, how do you fuck that up?

38:44.560 --> 38:46.200
It's not supposed to go in my ass?

38:46.200 --> 38:47.200
Damn it.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.640
Alright, well anyway, so Konami, even though we've gotten way off track, Konami said they

38:50.640 --> 38:54.200
were going to make this big announcement on Monday, and then here it was.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.200
Here was the big announcement.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.200
Here it is.

38:57.200 --> 39:01.240
Last week, Konami announced new games in its Castlevania and DDR series.

39:01.240 --> 39:07.440
It's going to be an incredible 2007, so stay tuned to these pages for the latest from Konami.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.800
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

39:09.800 --> 39:14.120
I mean, everybody was thinking, oh, it's going to be the Metal Gear Solid 4 information.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.640
Oh, it's going to be Silent Hill Origins.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.640
Oh, Silent Hill 5.

39:16.640 --> 39:20.760
No, it was, hey, our big announcement is that we already made our announcement.

39:20.760 --> 39:21.760
Sorry.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.760
What?

39:22.760 --> 39:23.760
That's it?

39:23.760 --> 39:24.760
That was it.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.760
Not even a reach around?

39:25.760 --> 39:26.760
No.

39:26.760 --> 39:27.760
Nothing.

39:27.760 --> 39:28.760
I'm bitter.

39:28.760 --> 39:29.760
Nothing.

39:29.760 --> 39:30.760
No.

39:30.760 --> 39:34.280
Any shitty, shitty, USB Frogger games for everybody.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.280
Yay.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.280
No.

39:36.280 --> 39:41.760
If only Bar Man Act Zero were $4.

39:41.760 --> 39:46.640
I'm tempted to wrap this up in toilet paper and give it away on the station to a lucky

39:46.640 --> 39:47.640
listener.

39:47.640 --> 39:51.280
Wait, is there going to be poop on that toilet paper?

39:51.280 --> 39:52.280
No, maybe.

39:52.280 --> 39:53.280
Ew.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.280
But I don't want it.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.280
No.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.280
Maybe some Hershey's Kisses or something.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.280
All right.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.280
Anyway.

39:58.280 --> 39:59.280
From your butt.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.280
What is wrong with tonight's program?

40:00.280 --> 40:01.280
I don't know.

40:01.280 --> 40:04.320
Rice Princess and Eddie the Gay are here, but this program's off tonight.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.520
Did you say Eddie the Gay?

40:06.520 --> 40:07.520
Eddie the Gay.

40:07.520 --> 40:08.520
Eddie Casper the Gay.

40:08.520 --> 40:13.520
That's his full name, right?

40:13.520 --> 40:14.520
I know I'm awesome.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.520
All right.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.520
Who's got the next story?

40:16.520 --> 40:17.520
Is it me?

40:17.520 --> 40:18.520
Your mom.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.520
Oh, no.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.520
Jamie, I believe it's you.

40:20.520 --> 40:21.520
Is it?

40:21.520 --> 40:22.520
Oh.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.520
Yes.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.520
I'm not your mom.

40:24.520 --> 40:28.040
That would be wrong.

40:28.040 --> 40:32.960
Looks like Activision has a hair up their ass because they're suing their own people.

40:32.960 --> 40:37.080
Not really their own people, but they're suing people who worked on Guitar Hero now.

40:37.080 --> 40:43.760
Remember that whole big stink they were having with the Ant Commandos for the unlicensed

40:43.760 --> 40:44.760
guitar controller?

40:44.760 --> 40:53.160
Well, they're suing them again and also including as defendants some folks that were with Red

40:53.160 --> 41:00.160
Octane previously, that would be John Tam, Corey Fong.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.880
Wasn't John Tam the dude that went to your house?

41:01.880 --> 41:02.880
Yes, he is.

41:02.880 --> 41:03.880
How funny.

41:03.880 --> 41:04.880
He was pretty funny.

41:04.880 --> 41:05.880
I mean, not funny.

41:05.880 --> 41:06.880
I'm sorry, John.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.880
It's not funny, but just interesting.

41:08.880 --> 41:09.880
Sorry.

41:09.880 --> 41:10.880
Small world.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.720
I'll just sit down and shut up.

41:12.720 --> 41:19.760
Well, also included is Corey Fong and Jamie Yang, who were...

41:19.760 --> 41:25.160
They actually started another company since then that's working in conjunction with the

41:25.160 --> 41:26.160
Ant Commandos.

41:26.160 --> 41:32.640
So, in other words, these guys left Red Octane to go work with the Ant Commandos on a yet

41:32.640 --> 41:36.720
unannounced game that probably has something to do with guitars?

41:36.720 --> 41:41.920
Well, Activision is accusing them of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, misappropriating

41:41.920 --> 41:46.720
trade secrets and confidential information, breach of contract, interference with constructional

41:46.720 --> 41:49.880
relations and being stinky.

41:49.880 --> 41:53.600
I'm glad they don't remember before 2005.

41:53.600 --> 42:00.080
I mean, just, hmm, Guitar Freaks, ring a bell, anybody, no.

42:00.080 --> 42:04.800
I even brought that up in a conversation, like, well, yeah, but we're different.

42:04.800 --> 42:05.800
No, you're not.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.800
To be fair, they are.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.840
Okay, they have five buttons.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.940
Guitar Hero, no, it's more than that.

42:11.940 --> 42:12.940
You know it.

42:12.940 --> 42:17.480
The game has a completely different look and feel than Guitar Freaks does, and it's crossed

42:17.480 --> 42:19.040
over into popularity in a way.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.040
I'm sorry.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.040
I'm sorry, Bomani fans.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.040
Guitar Freaks could never do.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.040
Okay, fine.

42:23.040 --> 42:26.760
If I put Keyboard Mania and made it look like Karaoke Revolution, oh, look, I got Keyboard

42:26.760 --> 42:27.840
Hero.

42:27.840 --> 42:31.080
That's all they fucking did is they changed the way the game looks.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.360
Okay, great.

42:32.360 --> 42:35.040
The notes come at me instead of straight up.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.200
You know what other game did the exact same thing?

42:37.200 --> 42:38.200
In the groove.

42:38.200 --> 42:44.800
Is that different from you have a game like, I don't know, you have a platformer game like

42:44.800 --> 42:49.860
Mario where he jumps and hits things, and then you have another game with a hero, like,

42:49.860 --> 42:53.480
I don't know, The Legend of Kage where he jumps and hits things.

42:53.480 --> 42:54.480
I don't know.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.480
That's really obscure.

42:55.480 --> 42:56.480
It's exactly the same.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.480
That's exactly the same.

42:57.480 --> 42:58.480
It's a move on.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.480
So why isn't it a problem there?

43:00.480 --> 43:02.760
Because they're stupid and they don't want to make a big fuss about it.

43:02.760 --> 43:03.760
But here's the thing.

43:03.760 --> 43:04.760
Here's where I have a problem.

43:04.760 --> 43:08.920
I have a problem when you have the second person to come along and copy something and

43:08.920 --> 43:11.320
say, oh, we're the originators of this stuff.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.940
Bullshit, you were the originators.

43:12.940 --> 43:16.720
You have no room to talk because this other company wants to make a guitar game.

43:16.720 --> 43:21.840
That's just like when Street Fighter II was out there and then fighting games became popular.

43:21.840 --> 43:22.840
You know what?

43:22.840 --> 43:26.720
If say Mortal Kombat or whatever came down the line.

43:26.720 --> 43:27.720
Mortal Kombat.

43:27.720 --> 43:28.720
Thank you.

43:28.720 --> 43:29.720
That's an excellent example.

43:29.720 --> 43:30.720
What about King of Fighters?

43:30.720 --> 43:31.720
What about World Heroes?

43:31.720 --> 43:32.720
What about Art of Fighting?

43:32.720 --> 43:33.720
What about Street Fighter?

43:33.720 --> 43:36.760
Well, Art of Fighting, World Heroes and King of Fighters were all SNK so they could get

43:36.760 --> 43:37.760
away with it.

43:37.760 --> 43:38.760
That's fine.

43:38.760 --> 43:39.760
Here's what I'm saying.

43:39.760 --> 43:40.760
But they're all Street Fighter.

43:40.760 --> 43:41.760
Here's what I'm saying, though.

43:41.760 --> 43:44.040
Fatal Fury actually had multi-plane fighting, but sorry.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.480
Okay, well, here's what I'm saying.

43:45.480 --> 43:49.160
If the fucking originators of Fatal Fury came out and said, oh, we're pissed off that people

43:49.160 --> 43:51.320
are copying our game, no, fuck them.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.960
They were second in line or third in line.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.380
They have no room to talk.

43:55.380 --> 43:59.760
It's just like, you know, if the originators of In the Groove came out and said, oh, well,

43:59.760 --> 44:04.720
we're pissed off that, you know, Dance Factory came out, well, fuck you, you copied someone

44:04.720 --> 44:05.720
else.

44:05.720 --> 44:08.040
The fighting games were actually around well before Street Fighter, but also, let's not

44:08.040 --> 44:12.560
forget, though, remember the old houses for Obscure?

44:12.560 --> 44:17.440
Pac-Man versus KC Crazy Chase for The Odyssey 2.

44:17.440 --> 44:23.280
That game is now so hard to find because of being sued by Williams and Midway, but it's

44:23.280 --> 44:24.280
the same thing.

44:24.280 --> 44:29.660
Maze games have been around in a physical form before there were, remember the old mouse

44:29.660 --> 44:31.520
trap games?

44:31.520 --> 44:34.080
They existed beforehand.

44:34.080 --> 44:41.280
I just think it's just a double standard right now that they really, well, the whole problem

44:41.280 --> 44:45.920
is that Konami didn't do anything to, you know, protect their guitar freaks, you know,

44:45.920 --> 44:50.020
patents or whatever they had there, so now they can't really, you know, stand on that.

44:50.020 --> 44:55.440
But I still think it's retarded that they're suing over, you know, this game that, you

44:55.440 --> 44:58.840
know what, Harmonix is working on something else right now and it's gonna blow this shit

44:58.840 --> 45:03.720
away and then whatever, everyone's gonna get a big boner over that, so whatever.

45:03.720 --> 45:10.680
Anywho, speaking of Guitar Hero, Activision is definitely showing their interest in Nintendo

45:10.680 --> 45:19.080
platforms talking about doubling their, or aggressively targeting the Wii and DS for

45:19.080 --> 45:23.880
titles such as, you know, the Spider-Man Shrek, etc., and talking about bringing Guitar Hero

45:23.880 --> 45:24.880
to the Wii.

45:24.880 --> 45:29.160
Although, what I've been reading, though, is it might not actually be Guitar Hero, might

45:29.160 --> 45:36.680
be some other guitar game, but still, though, yeah, I guess you could do that, but the DS,

45:36.680 --> 45:40.680
I don't know about that, that'd be kinda dumb, but we'll see.

45:40.680 --> 45:43.680
Yeah, how exactly do you do Guitar Hero on the DS?

45:43.680 --> 45:45.680
Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap, that's kinda dumb.

45:45.680 --> 45:46.680
Yeah.

45:46.680 --> 45:47.780
I don't know.

45:47.780 --> 45:51.680
Maybe something would like you hold the chords with the stylus, I don't know, that's kinda

45:51.680 --> 45:55.080
lame, but then that's why I don't design games, I guess.

45:55.080 --> 45:58.160
Maybe I'll have a fun peripheral.

45:58.160 --> 46:02.520
Anyhow, some other Konami music game related news, I should state, by the way, we were

46:02.520 --> 46:09.840
the first website anywhere in the planet to run the official song list of DDR Universe

46:09.840 --> 46:14.000
on the Xbox 360, the default song list is what it's gonna look like there.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.120
Our very own staffer Mel B. did some work on that and found that, so if you wanna see

46:18.120 --> 46:20.040
that, head on over to orangeontree.com.

46:20.040 --> 46:24.920
Very interesting lineup, I gotta say, Cascada, every time we touch is in it, Rapper's Delight

46:24.920 --> 46:29.320
by the Sugarhill Gang is in it, that's gotta be fun, and Kylie Minogue is in it as well,

46:29.320 --> 46:30.320
so it's gonna be fun.

46:30.320 --> 46:33.720
I hope it has an equally retarded video like it did in Pump It Up.

46:33.720 --> 46:35.040
I don't know, we'll see.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.040
That was hilarious.

46:36.040 --> 46:42.440
Also, I wanted to say this regarding official Konami music games, there's an interesting

46:42.440 --> 46:46.920
report on Bomani Style that was run earlier this week, we received our first confirmation

46:46.920 --> 46:52.760
from Betzen that Beatmania 2DX Arcade will soon be testing in the next few weeks in Illinois

46:52.760 --> 46:55.760
at Brunswick Zone in Naperville.

46:55.760 --> 47:02.800
No version has been confirmed as of yet, although it is rumored to be Beatmania 2DX Gold.

47:02.800 --> 47:07.960
What this is basically saying is that, possibly, Betzen could be distributing Beatmania 2DX

47:07.960 --> 47:09.960
Gold here in the States.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.020
Usually Beatmania 2DX machines have to be imported from other countries, which is why

47:13.020 --> 47:15.180
you see them so, so rarely.

47:15.180 --> 47:20.000
But very interesting that they would do this now, because Konami didn't announce a Beatmania

47:20.000 --> 47:23.680
2 at their Gamers' Day, and they came out with Beatmania 1 last year, which makes me

47:23.680 --> 47:27.320
think, I don't know if Beatmania 2 is coming out for the home.

47:27.320 --> 47:30.880
So what would be the strategy of them trying to release one in the arcades?

47:30.880 --> 47:32.360
I don't know.

47:32.360 --> 47:33.360
What do you think, though?

47:33.360 --> 47:36.880
Do you think they should release Beatmania 2DX over here in the arcades, or do you think

47:36.880 --> 47:37.880
it's a lost cause?

47:37.880 --> 47:42.340
Well, there's been places that have had it for years anyway.

47:42.340 --> 47:44.200
But they're very niche places, you know?

47:44.200 --> 47:47.960
Yeah, and the thing is, is that the majority of arcades are really going to be really lazy

47:47.960 --> 47:51.040
and not want to upkeep that type of machine.

47:51.040 --> 47:54.280
So if it's going to be around, it's only going to be at major places that are guaranteed

47:54.280 --> 47:55.280
to be well-kept.

47:55.280 --> 47:59.200
Other than that, they're going to be wasting however many thousand dollars a machine is

47:59.200 --> 48:02.120
on something they don't want to keep up.

48:02.120 --> 48:05.820
JV Mon says, get hype through the arcades, and then people would be like, hey, I want

48:05.820 --> 48:06.820
to play that at home.

48:06.820 --> 48:11.200
So maybe this is a way for them to re-light a fire under the Beatmania franchise at home.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.200
I don't know.

48:12.200 --> 48:17.320
I had heard the series didn't do that bad, but the fact that they didn't announce the

48:17.320 --> 48:19.440
sequel kind of makes you worry.

48:19.440 --> 48:23.440
Eh, not really, because I'm wondering if they just don't know what they're going to do with

48:23.440 --> 48:24.440
platforms.

48:24.440 --> 48:30.040
I mean, if you think about it, say they haven't started Beatmania 2 yet, where's the PlayStation

48:30.040 --> 48:32.200
2 going to be, say, in November?

48:32.200 --> 48:33.520
I mean, they don't know.

48:33.520 --> 48:36.480
So it's kind of a risky thing to do.

48:36.480 --> 48:41.000
That's why there weren't really any PlayStation 2 games announced at Gamers' Day.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.120
Gaming Nerd says something interesting, 2DX barely gets any money in the U.S. to begin

48:45.120 --> 48:46.120
with.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.120
2DX Gold will be no different.

48:47.120 --> 48:52.160
But what if they take the Beatmania 2DX machines out of the niche arcades that have them now,

48:52.160 --> 48:54.720
you know, the arcades that are willing to import games, and they put them in your local

48:54.720 --> 48:55.720
bowling alley?

48:55.720 --> 48:59.080
You know, your local other arcade would stand to make more.

48:59.080 --> 49:01.840
And plus, the machines are going to be cheaper if they're done here domestically.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.760
They're going to be half as much, I think.

49:03.760 --> 49:04.760
I don't know.

49:04.760 --> 49:05.760
I'm just guessing.

49:05.760 --> 49:08.600
But they might stand to make more in profit.

49:08.600 --> 49:09.600
Just a thought.

49:09.600 --> 49:13.920
Especially those machines, it's just that they have, you know, the giant plasma screen

49:13.920 --> 49:14.920
on it and stuff.

49:14.920 --> 49:18.400
I mean, granted, there are a lot of machines nowadays that have, you know, giant plasma

49:18.400 --> 49:19.400
screens.

49:19.400 --> 49:24.640
But, you know, I know with Golf Land, for example, we have little kids fucking breaking

49:24.640 --> 49:25.640
that shit.

49:25.640 --> 49:31.880
You know, replacing a plasma screen isn't cheap, and that's, you know, bad.

49:31.880 --> 49:35.280
One can only hope, though, that if we're going to get it, it's going to at least be in good

49:35.280 --> 49:36.280
shape.

49:36.280 --> 49:41.720
I have a little bit of something that will be in good shape, because, well, it's brand

49:41.720 --> 49:42.720
new.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.800
So, we have our UK release dates.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.800
How's that sound?

49:46.800 --> 49:47.800
Yippee!

49:47.800 --> 49:53.000
Coming out on the 16th is a bunch of stuff.

49:53.000 --> 49:59.280
We have Armed Assault, or is it Arm A, I guess?

49:59.280 --> 50:04.200
Arthur and the Invisibles, Cartoon Network Racing, Excite Truck, God Hand, Infernal,

50:04.200 --> 50:09.720
Mario Hoops 3 on 3, Over the Hedge, Hammy Goes Nuts, Sherlock Holmes, The Awakened,

50:09.720 --> 50:15.800
Supreme Commander, Toko Race Driver 3, and Tortuga, Two Treasures.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.120
Great.

50:17.120 --> 50:18.480
Wow.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.720
Great.

50:19.720 --> 50:24.120
Sorry, I seem kind of short.

50:24.120 --> 50:25.120
Well, it's...

50:25.120 --> 50:27.200
Yeah, I guess it's a slow month.

50:27.200 --> 50:30.120
I'm looking at the Japanese release dates, they're not much longer, but...

50:30.120 --> 50:31.120
Yeah.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.040
I mean, the U.S., it's a pretty decent week, at least.

50:33.040 --> 50:37.400
We're going to see some new stuff for the Wii with Wii Play, so if you're short a remote

50:37.400 --> 50:42.520
and need to buy one for cheap, Wii Play is the way to go.

50:42.520 --> 50:46.520
And then, of course, if you're not in, or don't have a Wii, on PlayStation 2, Ghost

50:46.520 --> 50:52.320
Rider, which is kind of a rip-off of God of War, but, you know, God of War's not a bad

50:52.320 --> 50:53.920
game, so definitely worth checking out.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.320
It's also cheap, only $29.99.

50:56.320 --> 50:59.560
I played Ghost Rider at E3, I don't know how much the game's changed, I mean, granted it's

50:59.560 --> 51:00.560
been six months.

51:00.560 --> 51:03.080
But that game sucked ass at E3, I'm sorry, it was horrid.

51:03.080 --> 51:04.560
It looks a lot better now.

51:04.560 --> 51:08.000
Well, that's encouraging, because maybe they took all the negative feedback from E3 and

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
did some retooling, so...

51:09.000 --> 51:10.200
I think so, it looks pretty...

51:10.200 --> 51:13.560
Alright, then I retract my statement, a game can change a lot in six months.

51:13.560 --> 51:18.800
It looks very similar to God of War, like a very ripped-off God of War.

51:18.800 --> 51:25.560
Anyways, the Warriors is coming out on PSP, and that's pretty inexpensive as well, only

51:25.560 --> 51:28.320
$19.99, so definitely check it out.

51:28.320 --> 51:32.880
Ratchet & Clank Size Matters on the PSP, if you're a Ratchet & Clank fan.

51:32.880 --> 51:38.760
Galactic Civilizations 2, Dark Avatar, the expansion pack for that game is finally coming

51:38.760 --> 51:39.760
out.

51:39.760 --> 51:43.880
Test Drive Unlimited on PC, finally making its way to market.

51:43.880 --> 51:50.560
Gurumen, A Monsterous Adventure on the PSP, brand new Atlus game.

51:50.560 --> 51:56.280
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas on the PSP, lots of PSP love this week.

51:56.280 --> 52:02.280
Monster Kingdom Jewel Summoner... what?

52:02.280 --> 52:03.280
I'm sorry, I...

52:03.280 --> 52:04.280
Stop making comments behind me!

52:04.280 --> 52:10.120
No, we're not making comments at you, I've been, I'm flashing my chest at Irene.

52:10.120 --> 52:15.160
Stop getting Irene excited, it's really, it's really distracting.

52:15.160 --> 52:16.160
Anyways...

52:16.160 --> 52:18.360
Thank God we're not a TV show.

52:18.360 --> 52:22.360
Dream Lords on the PC, brand new MMO.

52:22.360 --> 52:27.440
And then finally, a GameStop exclusive, Chulip, when I gotta tell you this game looks like

52:27.440 --> 52:28.440
a...

52:28.440 --> 52:29.440
Wait, it's a GameStop exclusive?

52:29.440 --> 52:32.200
It's a GameStop exclusive, and it looks like a piece of doggy shit.

52:32.200 --> 52:38.040
Wait, I played this game at E3 like two years ago when it was first, it was cute, I mean,

52:38.040 --> 52:41.040
it isn't, is it $19.99?

52:41.040 --> 52:43.160
Because that might be okay.

52:43.160 --> 52:47.860
But yeah, I mean, it isn't gonna win any awards, but it was cute, I mean, you know what you're

52:47.860 --> 52:48.860
getting into, okay?

52:48.860 --> 52:51.360
It's a game called Chulip for Christ's sake.

52:51.360 --> 52:53.520
Yeah.

52:53.520 --> 52:54.520
It's a kissing simulator.

52:54.520 --> 52:55.520
Yeah, it's a kissing game.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.520
You go around, you kiss people.

52:56.520 --> 52:57.520
Oh man, that's gonna...

52:57.520 --> 52:58.520
What?

52:58.520 --> 53:00.560
It's gonna, it's like a sexual harassment game.

53:00.560 --> 53:04.160
It's gonna sell really well amongst the nerds, because they'll need practice kissing, because

53:04.160 --> 53:09.920
they don't kiss anyone else, except for their moms.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.920
That's so wrong.

53:11.920 --> 53:17.720
No, um, no, Chulip is a $30 game.

53:17.720 --> 53:18.720
What?

53:18.720 --> 53:19.720
$29.99.

53:19.720 --> 53:20.720
Thank God.

53:20.720 --> 53:23.080
It'll be in the bargain bin in three weeks.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.080
Come on.

53:24.080 --> 53:25.080
You know it and I know it.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.080
Come on.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.720
Is that it?

53:27.720 --> 53:28.720
That's it.

53:28.720 --> 53:32.360
Japanese games coming out on February 15th on the PlayStation 2.

53:32.360 --> 53:35.480
There's not a lot, actually, across the various systems.

53:35.480 --> 53:39.480
Nothing on 360 or any of that stuff, but we have on PlayStation 2 Appleseed EX is coming

53:39.480 --> 53:41.140
out from Sega.

53:41.140 --> 53:46.640
They also are putting on Castlevania Curse of Darkness to Konami best hits.

53:46.640 --> 53:51.880
I should also mention this game, Shining Force EXA is coming out.

53:51.880 --> 53:56.560
Also Soul Cradle, Sekai o Kuro Mano is coming out.

53:56.560 --> 53:57.560
I know.

53:57.560 --> 53:58.560
Shut up, Irene.

53:58.560 --> 53:59.560
I butchered every...

53:59.560 --> 54:02.760
That's why they have me do the Japanese release dates, because I can't pronounce any of them.

54:02.760 --> 54:03.760
That was awesome.

54:03.760 --> 54:04.760
Shut up.

54:04.760 --> 54:05.760
I hate you.

54:05.760 --> 54:06.760
Sumimasen.

54:06.760 --> 54:12.840
Zero no Suikaima is coming out as well from Marvelous Entertainment on the PlayStation

54:12.840 --> 54:13.920
2.

54:13.920 --> 54:20.120
Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Bleach DS 2nd is coming out, and this game sounds like it

54:20.120 --> 54:21.120
might be fun.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.120
Death Note, Kira Game.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.120
Yes.

54:24.120 --> 54:25.120
I want that.

54:25.120 --> 54:26.120
It's coming out.

54:26.120 --> 54:27.120
What the hell is Death Note?

54:27.120 --> 54:28.120
I don't even know.

54:28.120 --> 54:29.120
Death Note is awesome.

54:29.120 --> 54:30.120
What is it?

54:30.120 --> 54:31.120
It's awesome.

54:31.120 --> 54:32.120
Okay.

54:32.120 --> 54:33.120
Okay.

54:33.120 --> 54:34.120
Thanks, Jamie.

54:34.120 --> 54:35.120
They're really descriptive.

54:35.120 --> 54:36.120
Hey, hey, hey.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.120
I'm going to preorder that shit right now.

54:37.120 --> 54:38.120
So, shut up.

54:38.120 --> 54:41.680
Death Note is a manga done by the same one who did Hikaru no Go.

54:41.680 --> 54:44.360
It's really, really, really, really, really, really, really cool.

54:44.360 --> 54:49.520
They just did a movie, and they're working on a second movie, and the anime is out right

54:49.520 --> 54:51.520
now.

54:51.520 --> 54:52.920
It's super awesome.

54:52.920 --> 54:58.600
It's about a guy who finds the notebook of a death god and then starts killing people.

54:58.600 --> 55:03.040
And that's all I'm going to say, because everyone should be reading it.

55:03.040 --> 55:11.120
And if that's not your cup of tea, Luminous 2 is coming out on the PSP in Japan.

55:11.120 --> 55:15.160
I'm not sure what songs they got different than we did, but I know they have some other

55:15.160 --> 55:16.280
songs there instead.

55:16.280 --> 55:19.760
I think we read them on a previous episode, so you'll have to go back and look, because

55:19.760 --> 55:21.160
I'm feeling too lazy.

55:21.160 --> 55:24.920
But I do want to point out also on Sony PSP, Tales of Destiny 2.

55:24.920 --> 55:28.000
If you're a Tales of Destiny fan, there you have it.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Oh, Rob.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.160
Domo arigato for that news.

55:31.160 --> 55:32.160
Shut up.

55:32.160 --> 55:39.220
Well, actually, why don't you reserve your Domo arigato for Dark Sakura, because she

55:39.220 --> 55:44.400
is going to give you her website of the week, and it's the place on the internet that you

55:44.400 --> 55:46.280
should definitely be checking out right now.

55:46.280 --> 55:47.280
It's not mine to give.

55:47.280 --> 55:48.280
All right.

55:48.280 --> 55:50.720
Well, we do.

55:50.720 --> 55:53.920
It's the gift that keeps on giving here on Orange One's Radio.

55:53.920 --> 55:55.240
Someone's sick and deranged website.

55:55.240 --> 55:56.240
All right.

55:56.240 --> 55:58.020
Well, you've found it, and you're highlighting it here for us.

55:58.020 --> 56:00.840
So arigato, Dark Sakura.

56:00.840 --> 56:08.320
Isn't that what Scott over on All Games calls you, Dark Sakura?

56:08.320 --> 56:12.200
Dark, dark, ball Sakura.

56:12.200 --> 56:14.440
Hearts, love you.

56:14.440 --> 56:17.240
Are you done?

56:17.240 --> 56:18.240
Yes.

56:18.240 --> 56:21.960
And the site of the week.

56:21.960 --> 56:22.960
Shut up, Rob.

56:22.960 --> 56:23.960
Sorry.

56:23.960 --> 56:24.960
I love that site.

56:24.960 --> 56:25.960
Let me introduce this again.

56:25.960 --> 56:26.960
I'm sorry.

56:26.960 --> 56:28.280
Let me try this again here.

56:28.280 --> 56:29.280
No, no, no, no.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.280
Just fucking play the music.

56:30.280 --> 56:31.280
I'm talking.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.280
No, no, no, no.

56:32.280 --> 56:33.280
Today's website of the week.

56:33.280 --> 56:34.280
No, no, no.

56:34.280 --> 56:35.280
Hold on.

56:35.280 --> 56:36.280
No.

56:36.280 --> 56:37.280
We're going to give this a proper...

56:37.280 --> 56:38.280
Jamie's kicking Rob's ass.com.

56:38.280 --> 56:39.280
All right.

56:39.280 --> 56:40.280
I'm sorry for butchering your name.

56:40.280 --> 56:41.280
So here we go.

56:41.280 --> 56:42.280
We're going to give...

56:42.280 --> 56:43.280
Here we go.

56:43.280 --> 56:44.280
Ready?

56:44.280 --> 56:47.280
It's time for Dark Sakura's hardcore website of the week.

56:47.280 --> 56:48.280
Yeah.

56:48.280 --> 56:54.280
We should do that from now on.

56:54.280 --> 57:01.280
Today's website of the week is davidtennis.com.

57:01.280 --> 57:07.280
Dude, I want to look up the extra music again.

57:07.280 --> 57:11.280
As I said, today's website of the week is davidtennis.com because I couldn't think of

57:11.280 --> 57:12.280
anything else.

57:12.280 --> 57:13.280
Oh, never mind.

57:13.280 --> 57:14.280
So much for the hardcore.

57:14.280 --> 57:15.280
Meow, meow, meow.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.280
Meow, meow, meow.

57:16.280 --> 57:19.280
That would be david-tennis.com.

57:19.280 --> 57:25.520
He is the man who plays the 10th doctor on Doctor Who and I love him.

57:25.520 --> 57:26.520
That's all.

57:26.520 --> 57:30.280
I think we should just change this feature to Doctor Who website of the week.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.280
Yeah, the Doctor Who website of the week.

57:31.280 --> 57:34.280
Hey, I haven't done a Doctor Who site in like three months.

57:34.280 --> 57:38.280
I could bite my ass in a non-literal way.

57:38.280 --> 57:41.280
Yes, Rice Princess has a question.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.280
I do.

57:42.280 --> 57:43.280
Can I help you?

57:43.280 --> 57:44.280
Eddie wants to know.

57:44.280 --> 57:45.280
Yes.

57:45.280 --> 57:46.280
In any of the Lincoln...

57:46.280 --> 57:48.280
Well, it was just, what, Ocarina of Time and...

57:48.280 --> 57:49.280
No, no.

57:49.280 --> 57:53.280
What ended up being the only village in the land of Hyrule in the Zelda games, Irene and

57:53.280 --> 57:56.280
I pronounce it differently and we're going to start a debate.

57:56.280 --> 58:00.280
I pronounce it Kakariko Village and Irene pronounces it...

58:00.280 --> 58:01.280
Kakariko.

58:01.280 --> 58:02.280
Maybe Kakariko.

58:02.280 --> 58:04.280
And she's Asian so she's probably right.

58:04.280 --> 58:05.280
Kakapupi.

58:05.280 --> 58:06.280
Kakapupi Village.

58:06.280 --> 58:10.280
All of us Whitey's back in the 90s called it Kakariko Village.

58:10.280 --> 58:15.080
Yeah, but if you read the Kana in Japanese it has pretty much even pronunciation on every

58:15.080 --> 58:16.800
syllable it would be Kakariko.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.280
I didn't know the village had a name.

58:18.280 --> 58:19.280
Are you serious?

58:19.280 --> 58:20.280
Like the village...

58:20.280 --> 58:22.280
That's exactly what I was going to say.

58:22.280 --> 58:26.280
It's the village that has the chickens that you beat up that all attack you.

58:26.280 --> 58:28.280
That's a really long title for it.

58:28.280 --> 58:29.280
I mean, it is the village.

58:29.280 --> 58:30.280
That's what Kakariko means.

58:30.280 --> 58:32.280
It means town of chickens.

58:32.280 --> 58:33.280
Town of chickens.

58:33.280 --> 58:36.280
The town of avenging chickens.

58:36.280 --> 58:46.480
Anyways, speaking of avenging chickens, we have a brand new program that's being started

58:46.480 --> 58:53.280
by Microsoft and kind of teaming up with Old Spice Deodorant to...

58:53.280 --> 58:58.280
No, I'm sorry, this is really funny because you know that stereotype.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.280
Any other game would be uncivilized.

59:00.280 --> 59:06.280
No, but you know like the gamer that's been sitting at home all day racking up these 10,000...

59:06.280 --> 59:07.280
I'm sorry.

59:07.280 --> 59:08.280
Finish your story.

59:08.280 --> 59:09.280
I apologize for interrupting.

59:09.280 --> 59:10.280
Any who.

59:10.280 --> 59:11.280
Then I'll make my deodorant joke.

59:11.280 --> 59:18.600
They're basically challenging Xbox Live users who are in America to add at least 1,500 achievement

59:18.600 --> 59:22.640
points to their gamer score between February 12th and April 12th.

59:22.640 --> 59:27.960
And depending on what your gamer score is now, starting off, that will depend on what

59:27.960 --> 59:29.240
prize package you win.

59:29.240 --> 59:33.880
And here are the different prize packages for you that you could possibly earn by wasting

59:33.880 --> 59:35.680
this much time.

59:35.680 --> 59:45.720
If your gamer score is 0 to 4,999, you can earn a game picture, a dashboard theme, and

59:45.720 --> 59:49.920
Contra for Xbox Live Arcade.

59:49.920 --> 59:51.220
That's level 1.

59:51.220 --> 59:58.280
Level 2, which is between 5,000 and 9,999 gamer points, you receive everything from

59:58.280 --> 01:00:03.680
the level 1 package as well as 100 Microsoft points and a contest t-shirt.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.680
Oh my god!

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.680
That's awesome!

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680
Dude!

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.680
Dude!

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680
I love your shirt!

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680
Dude!

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:19.180
Any who, if you have over 10,000 gamer points, you will earn the level 1 package, 200 Microsoft

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:22.960
points, a t-shirt, and Fusion Frenzy 2.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960
Oh my god!

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960
A t-shirt!

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960
Dude!

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960
Dude!

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960
Dude, I gotta get that t-shirt!

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960
That game fucking sucks!

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.080
But I gotta get the t-shirt!

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.800
And by the way, we here at Orange Launch Radio are excited to announce that there's actually

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:41.000
some secret levels that have not yet been unveiled, but here's the deal.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.140
If you have 20,000 gamer points or more, you're in level 4, and Old Spice will actually send

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:53.360
you free deodorant, because you probably need it if your gamerscore has gotten to be that

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.360
high.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.360
Actually, I'm not gonna include it in every level, because all of this stinks, so...

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:59.680
They're like, no, no, no, we don't care about the prizes, we really just want to get the

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.360
deodorant to you and we're masking it with the prizes.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:08.440
And if your gamerscore is 50,000 or above, you're on level 5, and Old Spice is going

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.920
to send you a free blow-up doll, because you probably need one of those as well.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.520
But you know what, the best prize is in level 6, they actually send someone to punch you

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.760
in the gob.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.760
QQ!

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:36.280
But if you, to enter this wonderful contest, just simply go to xbox.com slash rewards,

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:43.440
and you can enter after, well basically after the 12th, so hurry up and get those 1500 achievement

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:48.240
points so you can score that wonderful Fusion Frenzy 2, hooray!

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.320
Travis Donovan from our Saturday Night Program here at Orange Lounge says, worst product

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.760
tie-in promo ever.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.080
Black Wolf from the other Sunday Night Program on the other network, allgames.com says, level

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:05.320
3 package equals 830 point value plus t-shirt plus Bill Gates' favorite game.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.000
Oh my god, Fusion Frenzy 2 is Bill Gates' favorite game?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
What a loser!

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.320
That's probably the only game he's played this year.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.560
He's like, that's my favorite game.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.280
Mystic Goan says, I'm so tired of hearing, wow, you play so much, your stink is going

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.280
through the mic.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.320
Thanks, Old Spice!

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.800
QQ!

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.800
Anyhow, something else that is going to cause people to not leave the house for today, actually

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.920
I should ask real quick, are you going to participate in this, Loki?

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.340
Fuck no, Fusion Frenzy 2?

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.840
No, but you're not at that level, your gamer score is not 10,000.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.840
T-shirt?

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.840
I know, free t-shirt.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.840
Oh, t-shirt.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.840
Something to work out.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.720
I'm going to be doing Crackdown, so if I finish Crackdown that quick, I guess.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.080
DDR Universe is going to be an easy 1,000 points.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.080
DDR Universe, yeah.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.080
All right.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.080
Cookie Party.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.080
Anyhow, what?

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.080
Cookie Party?

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.080
What?

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.080
Cookie Party.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.080
You eat a Cookie Party t-shirt?

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.280
Fuck yeah, I would be renting, I'd be going to Blockbuster right now to rent like frickin'

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.440
NBA Live 06 or whatever those games are, I don't play, but I have the easiest gamer

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440
scores in the world.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.320
They give away a Cookie Party t-shirt, I'm all about that, and if you don't understand

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.320
the joke, that's too bad.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.160
The Halo 3 beta invite.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:23.240
Halo 3 beta invites the picture that are included with Crackdown, like the little slip that

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.400
comes in has been leaked out to the internet, and here's the catch about the Halo 3 beta,

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.540
you have to have the Crackdown disc to be able to play the Halo 3 beta, so no buying

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.640
the game, taking the slip out for the Halo 3 thing, and then selling the game back.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.080
You actually have to hang onto the game, probably past the return window, to actually play the

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.160
Halo 3 beta online.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:51.200
Just another thing too, the Halo 3 beta might not be available right as you pick up Crackdown.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.520
I hope nobody's expecting that, it's not going to be.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.920
I hope people don't think that's what's going to happen.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.680
It just means that you're going to get into the beta whenever it's available.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:09.040
Is that a subtle way for them to let people know that they're cracking down on that returning

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.040
thing?

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.960
Okay, I ruined that joke.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.320
Say goodbye to Rice Princess, everyone.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.320
It's the last show.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.760
It's nice knowing you, Rice Princess.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:16.760
Thanks for playing.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.760
You lose.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.760
Ball failed.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:24.760
Well, in other gaming news, there is a particular little game that a lot of people were sort

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:28.520
of obsessed of that didn't go so well in Japan called Loco Roco.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.920
Well, the sequel is now playable.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:42.720
You can go actually onto the website and there is a downloadable version.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720
Did you download it?

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.720
Not yet.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.720
Are you going to?

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.720
I haven't been home.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.720
I see.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.720
She got her hair did this weekend.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:49.720
I got my hair did.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720
Yeah.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:56.720
Now, there also is though a little bit of a rumor stating that it could be possible

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.680
this will be a PS3 version, but honestly, I'm really thinking that it should just stay

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:08.460
PSP because that type of game really lends itself well to the PSP, especially since you're

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:14.320
turning the six success is not going to be as much fun as the system itself or rocking

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.800
the system itself.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:21.160
Yeah, I'm hoping it'll go on PSP as well because PSP, actually, PSP is having a little bit

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.920
of a resurgence with the Castlevania and some of these other games that are coming out.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.200
It's importable ops and all these Konami's support behind PSP.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.840
It's actually becoming more and more like a system people ought to be checking out,

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.040
especially if a price cut isn't.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.040
I bought another PSP.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040
Did you?

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.040
Yeah.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.040
Good job.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.040
I bought it off of a friend.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.040
What's this?

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.040
Your fourth?

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.040
Well, I only have two now.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.040
Only?

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.040
Yeah.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.960
Well, basically, this one is going to be... I'm going to put the Dark Alex firmware on there

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960
now.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:58.640
It's because my friend, he mistreats his PSP, so he broke the buttons and the analog sticks,

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.720
so I have to fix that, but I bought it for three bucks.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:06.920
By the way, if you're listening to us on a PSP, you should visit OLRPSP.com.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.120
Loki hasn't updated it in about a year, but it's still pretty, and there's a background

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.120
that you can download.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.120
There will be new stuff eventually.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.120
Sure, there will.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.120
And I'm working on stuff.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.360
Right after you finish the Wii website, too, right?

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.760
Actually, that has to do with the OLR PSP.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.760
Oh, wheely.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.760
Wow.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.760
That's lame.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.760
Anyways.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.000
It's better than OPSP, really.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.760
Some cool stuff, though, that you might be able to do in the future will include Skype,

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:40.760
because apparently, speaking of the new firmwares coming out, they have dissected the firmware,

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:49.400
and they have found a little line of code here in 311 that talks about the Skype plug-in,

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.960
so it's something that will be coming out possibly later on.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.160
But that's kind of cool, though.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:00.440
So Skype support coming soon to your PSP.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.440
How is that going to work?

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.440
That's special.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.960
Because there's no microphone on it.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.640
Well, they have headsets for it.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.280
You can use headsets for...

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.920
What ever happened to the DS thing that was like Skype?

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.800
Remember when they showed that at E3?

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.080
Like they had the white Wi-Fi voice thing?

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.080
Voice over IP?

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.080
Yeah.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.640
Just like they have in Metroid Prime Hunter.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.600
Oh, they put it in one game, Big Wow.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.800
Actually, no, they have it in the new Diddy Kong Racing.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.360
I think you're missing my point.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.200
My point is, where is the standalone app where I can use this to call my friends across the

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.200
US for free?

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.520
Rob, now, if they had a standalone app, that would mean that they're embracing online.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.840
They don't want to let everyone know that they're embracing online.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.840
It's a secret.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.940
Oh, because they haven't actually embraced online.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:48.480
They're actually making the internet harder, is what Nintendo does.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480
You don't understand, Rob.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480
You don't understand.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.480
Wii Connect 24.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480
It's connected all the time.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:56.040
That means it's connected to something out there.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.960
Something that makes my Wii glow.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.520
But when I turn it on to see what that something is, there's nothing there.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.960
But shortly after I turned it on, there's stuff there.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.120
It's just it lets me know soon there will be more stuff there.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.300
Wake me up when the Wii downloads my porn for me.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.300
What the fuck is...

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.680
Honestly, and I hate to go on a rant about it again, but what the fuck is up with Wii

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.680
Connect 24?

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.680
It doesn't download my messages.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.080
I don't have current weather.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.600
I don't have current news.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.480
It doesn't download any updates.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.280
What the fuck is it doing?

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.120
Is your Wii on?

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.560
Yes, my Wii is on.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.920
No, no, it's devil power making it glow.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.200
You should be a Nintendo customer service rabbi.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.920
Oh yeah, because I've had the total opposite experience.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.760
My Wii starts glowing, I turn it on, and there's messages right there.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.440
All the updates are downloaded without me having to do anything, so I don't know what

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.440
you're doing.

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.440
It's because you're like the biggest...

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.720
No, but don't you have to click in and actually do the update manually, right?

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.720
You still have to click the...

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.720
Yeah, I just had to do that.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720
What?

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.720
I've never had to do that.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720
Okay.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.000
Do you have the news channel on your Wii right now?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I do.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.220
Yeah, when there's a new server, because they're not just going to do that without you wanting

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.220
to do it.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.360
But the messages are there.

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.960
The updates have like...

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.660
Yeah, it'll tell you right away.

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:09.660
That was the thing.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.880
The thing about the 24s was to do all that shit without you having to think about it,

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880
right?

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.600
Not the extra apps though, because you have to choose what apps you want.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.080
Like I'd be kind of mad if I wanted, and I was like, I don't want that app, and it was

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.080
on there, you know?

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.760
But like the messages, I don't have to download them.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.900
They're already there when I turn it on.

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:30.760
You do realize that those downloading apps that you so call, those are actually firmware

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.760
updates.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.040
The apps were meant to be on the system, and all you're doing is updating the firmware.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:39.740
So yes, you are having to download the updates it's not doing for you automatically.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.760
It's not downloading the programs, say like the internet browser, that you actually had

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.760
to download.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.760
Yeah!

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.480
But what if you don't want the internet browser?

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.480
Too bad!

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.480
Then don't download it!

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.480
Oh, why?

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:52.420
The internet browser you don't have to download, it's news and weather.

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.920
You need your news and weather.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.360
Oh yeah, I really need that really bad.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.000
I would like to take a quick poll of all the Wii owners in the room.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.120
How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.160
How many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.360
I will go first.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.140
I've used the forecast channel twice, and the news channel three times.

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:17.920
And once was this week because I was looking for pictures of Anna Nicole Smith.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.000
Loki.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.120
I used the forecast channel once today, but it had weather from midnight, which said it

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.800
was still raining, yet outside it's blurring sun, so apparently that was wrong.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.360
And Loki went outside in a huge park going, man, fuck the Wii!

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.240
I just wanted to know if it was raining later, but I'd have to go in and...

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.920
How about you open a window, dumbass, that's going to tell you if it's raining or not.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.600
Well, I know if it's raining now, I want to know if it's raining later, hence the forecast.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.240
I don't want to know what it's doing now, I mean, because I can just look out a window.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.680
We can open it now, Kat.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680
Exactly.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.800
I don't want to know what weather it was at midnight, oh great, it was raining while I

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:54.800
was asleep.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.800
Excellent!

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:56.800
That's great to know!

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.360
In case I was outside when I was sleeping!

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.360
So it...

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.360
That's stupid.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.040
Well, the Sleepwalkers of America, thank you, you insensitive fuck.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.440
Well, they would know after the fact, they'd be like, what the fuck?

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.440
It's raining!

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.760
They're like, oh man, I have pneumonia, this sucks.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.120
DarkSakura, how many times have you used the news channel and the forecast channel?

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.000
She's holding up a big fat zero.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Eddie?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.760
Just one time when I first got it.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.200
Dan just used it, though.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.240
Like every day?

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.400
I just happened to be in the living room and he had it up while I was sleeping.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.400
Okay, so once.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.000
More than that, but I just thought once.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.080
I haven't used either before, but I use the foreskin channel a lot.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.480
It's my favorite one.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.880
Why are you on the... who invited you on tonight's program?

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880
Nobody did, did they?

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880
Me?

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880
That's what I thought.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880
I invited myself.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.880
I remembered why you haven't been on this program in a while.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.000
Anyway, moving on to other news.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.680
News coming out of DICE, the DICE show, D-I-C-E, coming out of Las Vegas, the PSP and the PS3

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.200
networks will be joining together.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.120
That was coming from Phil Harrison, quote, this year we'll be adding some functionality

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.200
to the PSP that will unify our approach.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.520
So we really don't know what exactly that means yet.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.360
That means I don't have to buy a PlayStation 3 to download PlayStation 1 games to my PSP.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.440
If maybe that means that they'll have the same look and feel of the store or what's

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.520
going on, but we don't really know.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:27.480
That means that the PlayStation Portable will actually have a network store, since it doesn't

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.480
right now.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:32.560
That'll be kind of nice, because the Sony website isn't even that great on the PSP.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560
I don't know if you've gotten to it.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.560
It's not that great.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:42.960
I try not to go to it, because it's lame.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.480
I'm reading comments in chatroom, by the way, who's given some feedback on the whole debate

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.800
we were having in here.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.160
James Patrick says, forecast is good here in Texas, it told me it was going to rain

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.160
a couple of times.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.160
Interesting.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.400
Burshad says, wait, we are gamers, we are in the basement, no windows.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.640
Oh, I forgot.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.640
Sorry about that.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.640
How could I forget?

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.040
Oh, yeah, because we're on the second story.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.040
Anyhow.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:16.520
Well, I actually read an article last week about an HMV UK retailer who was doing a PSP

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.760
PS3 bundle.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:24.720
They have retracted it now due to consumer pissed-offness.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.720
They've heard the people.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.720
Is that the legal term?

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.220
Yes, pissed-offness.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:33.360
They have heard the people, they have gone back and said that for anyone who's participated

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:39.480
in the pre-order, they will give them an option of just ordering the PS3 or get the bundle.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:48.560
The PS3 is going to cost £425 on the March 23 release in Europe with 220,000 units to

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.760
be available on that day.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:57.240
But, yeah, if you're going through HMV, you can just order just the PS3 now, although

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.240
I don't know why.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.720
There's only one good game on it.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.240
So they did this in response to customer demand?

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.240
Pretty much.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.920
So the tribe has spoken?

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.160
The PMS of the masses have spoken.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.160
I see.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.160
All right.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.220
Well, there's some other news that came out of DICE this week as well, featuring some

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:21.440
wonderful announcements of stuff, including the PlayStation Ducks are back and their own

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:27.200
game now called Super Rub-a-Dub, and apparently the game looks very similar to the arcade

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.920
game Bubbles, which is kind of interesting.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.960
You tilt the screen around, moving the mother duck to collect the baby ducks and reach the

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.960
end.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:44.000
Yeah, that will be coming sometime soon, I guess.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.720
And then, of course, they were talking about SingStar for the PlayStation 3 and how the

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.560
PlayStation Store will be supporting that as well.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.280
So that's not a big surprise.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.560
And of course, also talking about how people will be able to create their own custom user

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.040
pages, including video performances of them singing.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:13.680
I assume that you would need the eye toy for this, or the EYE OF JUDGEMENT, or whatever.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.880
And then, of course, they were talking about- Will Simon Cowell be a part of the Eye of

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.880
Judgment?

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880
I thought it was awful.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.240
No, they will not.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.560
I think you should take a gun and shoot yourself in the face.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:28.240
And then finally, the PlayStation 3 online platform will continue to evolve aggressively.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.920
Well, that's great, because one game, or less than one game a month, kind of sucks

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.880
right now with your PlayStation online store.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.000
I know people bitch about no updates to the Xbox 360s market, but jeez.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.440
Yeah, at least Xbox 360s gains stuff on a weekly basis, at least.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.160
I have yet to see some new demos come to the PlayStation 3 store.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.240
But it's early for PlayStation.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.160
Xbox was slow in the beginning as well.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.800
Yeah, I remember that, but still though, come on.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.840
I don't want to see an update- Oh, there's new stuff on the PlayStation Store!

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:05.200
It's a new PS1 game that you can't play on the PS3, you need to play it on your PSP.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.200
Well, fuck you.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.480
Raven's Dolphin says, Loki, I think the duck is a joke I do not know.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.040
What's the duck joke?

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:16.280
The duck they showed at every new console launch, it's like the tech demo that they

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280
had.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:23.880
Oh, the way they build a tub with the rubber ducks to do how many on-screen polygons.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:30.400
That was on the very first disc, the PS position demo disc.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.840
Well speaking of PlayStation, at least the portable types, they're going to get you in

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.800
trouble in New York City pretty soon.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.200
But don't worry, Sony fanboys, Nintendo DS is a fair game as well.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.640
This is the reason, three pedestrians have been killed in Brooklyn since September because

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:50.200
they step into the road while using an electronic device and it distracts them from people yelling,

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.200
watch out!

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.320
You know, hey, get out of the way, there's a car coming.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:58.020
And what they're thinking about doing now is that they're going to pass a law that says,

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:02.160
it's legislation, it hasn't been passed yet, but it's on the table, about you could be

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:08.240
charged a $100 fine if you're using a PSP, a Nintendo DS, an iPod, a Blackberry, or a

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.960
mobile phone, all while crossing the road.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:16.880
So I think it's dangerous to use a device and walk.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.120
What about people driving?

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:21.080
Oh, it's dangerous too, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.160
Well, she is illegal there too, isn't it?

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:26.080
But well, yeah, I mean, that's already illegal in New York City, but you have to remember

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.080
the very...

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.080
It's illegal here too, Rob.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.200
Well, not yet, but it almost is, but keep this in mind is that...

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.600
I switched to speakerphone anyway.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.800
Back off, lady.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.700
The thing you have to remember too, in New York City, hello, it's unlike any other city

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:40.700
when you're talking about pedestrians.

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.280
I mean, there's so freaking many pedestrians.

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:46.440
So it really is kind of its own unique little world.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.440
You know what?

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.440
They make the laws for a reason.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.400
They're trying to protect people, not inhibit what they're doing.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.680
Apparently it takes a few retarded people stepping out in the traffic, jaywalking while

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.600
talking on their cell phone or playing a fucking game.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.000
Who would the fucking play a game and walk in the first place is what I want to know,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
but whatever.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So they're doing it.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.320
Some of our New York City living friends chime in on this in the chat.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.580
Rama says, Sky, some people are too stupid to pay attention.

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:15.520
You do not turn the volume up to the point where you cannot hear a honking horn.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:19.040
Legend of Zaku says, looks like this guy hasn't heard about natural selection.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.040
Amen to that.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.080
What do you guys think about this law?

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.760
Is this a needed law, a necessity?

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:33.000
I think that Darwinism should just be let work because that would cleanse the gene pool.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Wow.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.180
All right.

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:39.440
I think we have to blame Grand Theft Auto for this because in Grand Theft Auto you run

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.440
over people.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.960
So therefore Grand Theft Auto is to blame because these people are getting run over

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.000
by cars.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.480
It makes perfect sense.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.240
Where is the justice with these damn M-rated games?

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:53.740
We need to take them off the shelves because clearly it's not incompetent people that are

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.240
causing deaths.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.240
It is these M-rated games.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:03.960
How do they know that the drivers aren't playing their PSPs while they're driving?

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.200
Like maybe it's their fault.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.560
Maybe the driver is playing driver.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:11.720
Yeah, and then a car just falls right in front of them out of the sky.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.840
I just got punched in the face by a gay man.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:18.080
I think it's kind of a silly piece of legislation right there.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.080
But that's just me.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.080
I live in New York.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.080
I don't know.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:25.200
But seriously, I think that if you're stupid enough to not pay attention when you're crossing

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.880
the road, you pretty much have it coming.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:34.440
I think it's one thing, if it was like a little kid who wasn't old enough to have the common

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.440
sense.

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.280
Well, the parents should be there to tell them to look out.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280
Exactly.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.640
Well, okay, but if they're walking home from school, but then again the parents should

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.960
still tell them in advance.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:48.480
They should teach them to look both ways before crossing the street, cross walks, and freaking

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:51.920
pay attention because people are stupid.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.080
The drivers aren't going to pay any more attention than they are.

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:59.080
If I'm crossing the road, hell yeah, I'm going to look and make sure that nobody's coming

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.080
for me.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:06.640
I think that if you think that your video game is more important than your life, by

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:12.360
all means play your game and spare the rest of us your DNA.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:17.640
I was thinking they shouldn't pass that so that people can still be getting hit by cars

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.560
while they're doing that, and then I can just run over and take their PSP while they're

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.000
on the ground, dying, and I'm like, yes, I have a PSP now.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Oh, you're so sympathetic.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I know.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I would totally do that.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Yeah, me too.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
It's like you're stupid.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
You don't deserve one of these.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.480
Well, I sense the angst rising in this room, and you know what happens when the angst rises?

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.480
People die.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:49.360
It's time for the FUs of the week here, boys and girls.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.360
I love the FUs of the week.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.040
Dark soccer, then start us off.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:21:01.760
A big FU to the medical industry for being more interested in selling us drugs than actually

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:11.760
fixing the problem, because they give you all these drugs that do nothing but treat

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:18.240
the symptoms or suppress the symptoms that your body creates to help you heal, and making

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:23.720
us more and more and more and more dependent on them, when I think it's one thing that

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.920
if you say have diabetes and need insulin, that's one thing.

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:38.080
That's chronic condition, but if you have the flu and think, oh my God, I need to take

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.720
this drug and this drug and this drug and this drug, when all you have to do is drink

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:47.440
some tea, take some vitamin C, and take some time off work and sleep, you don't need to

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:53.580
pay the whole reason that the medical field is so fucked up right now, because people

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:57.040
are too dependent on treating symptoms.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:03.640
I've learned so much since going into massage therapy about how the body works.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:08.200
And also, if you're stressed out, take some fucking time and breathe.

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:12.120
You're dumping adrenaline and other toxins into your liver, you are making yourself fucking

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.840
sick, just stop and breathe.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.360
I'm done.

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.840
Low key.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:23.560
Shut up, Fireballa, fuck you, and it'll give happy endings.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.120
If you want to join our chat room, you too can get yelled at by Dr. Stalker.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:34.500
I'd like to make an epi to the highway patrol in California, because I saw them speeding

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:38.960
and not changing lanes using their blinker.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.080
One of them did that, so props to him, but the other fucking guy, what kind of example

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.040
are you setting for these other drivers out there?

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.680
No wonder they're driving like assholes, because you drive like an asshole too, and they think

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:53.000
it's okay because the lawman's driving, you know, I don't give a shit if you can do that,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
whatever.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.480
So fuck that, and yeah, that's all I got.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.960
I'm not very angry today.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:08.880
Oh, yeah, fuck Activision for, you know, suing people over Guitar Hero, the completely original

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.920
guitar game out there.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:17.240
My FU of the week goes to my doctor for not being available when I meet her, and to the

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:21.680
dentist for my temporary crown falling out a second time.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.960
That's just lovely.

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:24.960
Rice Princess, do you have any FUs?

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.960
Any angst you'd like to get off your chest?

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.960
Yeah, I wanted to say FUs, too, because you're playing this version of One Night Angel, and

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:27.960
you should be playing the piano version.

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:28.960
Hello?

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:29.960
Jamie's Choice, not mine.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:30.960
Oh, okay.

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.960
Well, you can play that one.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:32.960
This is more hardcore.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:40.600
Yeah, so it would be in honor of Eddie and I. I remember that one from our show.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.600
I do.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.600
And nobody else does.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.600
Yeah, that's okay.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.600
Rice Princess.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.600
Well, then we can refresh their memories by reenacting it on their own.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.600
I think I deleted that in P3.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.920
I think I'm gonna punch you.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.960
Eddie, any FUs of the week you want to give?

01:23:53.960 --> 01:24:02.120
Yeah, I'm FUing whiny, immature, straight girls to steal, like, eyes from me, so, huh.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.120
Me too.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.120
Well.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.720
Stupid straight girl.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:06.720
Look out.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:11.400
That was a good comeback.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.960
Look out.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:16.560
You need a third eye for that one.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.560
Nobody understands that.

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.560
I know.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.560
I know, because no one listens to The Wednesday Show.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.240
Anyhow, I think now's a very good time to take a break.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.080
I don't know about you kids, but I think now's a good break time.

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.320
So we're gonna take a break right now.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:32.600
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
