Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for Part B of our podcast.
If this is the first time you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, remember that we do broadcast in two parts because we tape live on Sunday nights for about three hours, or as tonight's going, maybe about four hours.
And there's some bonus stuff that you can only hear when you listen to us live or when you listen to us on our rebroadcast over at allgames.com, which is Mondays at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time and Tuesdays at 9 a.m.
We like all games because it's this big...
and many more.
More rare games are going to make their way, I guess, to the DS.
Well, probably not the case, but according to Microsoft's VP, Shane Kim, he spoke to 1UP and basically told them a cameo or Viva Pinata on DS makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways from a franchise perspective.
I think it's fair to say we're going to continue to invest in Viva Pinata, but you probably won't see it on the PSP.
I would say you probably won't see it on the DS either because that's still a competing system with them, I mean.
That seems so weird to me.
So you're basically saying people are assuming because of the fact he said that.
Yeah.
I mean, and this just further lends that thing that Microsoft is secretly in bed with Nintendo, but they are so the bottom because Reggie just keeps, you know, regulating on Microsoft that, you know, no, we don't want to form a partnership with Microsoft.
We'd rather you buy more of our games and more of our components.
So Microsoft is totally being a submissive bottom in this relationship because now they're talking about, oh, but Nintendo, I'll totally put Viva Pinata inside you.
I don't know.
Is it just me?
It would work, but first off, Viva Pinata, the graphics wouldn't look right.
I mean, it's just another kind of,
Not really a Pokemon type of game, but it's your breeding stuff.
I don't know.
SSJ100Matt says, maybe Microsoft should give Nintendo advice on internet play.
You win.
Yeah, seriously.
Bandit says, hey Rare.
Yes, I'm talking with my mouth full.
I can do that.
It's partly my show too.
Bandit says, hey Rare, give me Killer Instinct already.
I say that with a mouthful of donut.
Fuck that, you get Banjo-Kazooie.
Eww.
Kazooie wasn't that bad.
I guess it was.
Mike W. says, Major Nelson, Major Nelson, Major Nelson Hearts Nintendo.
So does Trixie.
I remember reading on one of Trixie's blogs on Xbox.
I have no idea why I was reading Trixie's blog.
I was bored on the internet and that's where I found myself.
But, because whenever I hear Trixie, I think of the stripper in the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but never mind.
So I'm like, do you perform with the cast?
Anyway, but Trixie, she wrote her Christmas list, and one of the things on the Christmas list was a Wii.
Then I was like, aren't you guys supposed to be competitors?
So Microsoft, again, being the submissive big old bottom.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
That's your thing.
Can I say personally, though, that I'm actually really impressed at how the Xbox 360 just took off.
I mean, again, I'm more of a spectator because of the money.
But, I mean, at the very beginning, having an Xbox was just, oh, you know, you have a console that freezes.
And everybody's giving crap to all my friends who initially went out and bought an Xbox, and the 360 seems to be kicking some serious ass.
So, I mean, that seems to be exciting, and it's actually something that I enjoyed as well when I started to play it.
I love Spamusement.
So the spam email subject line was, are you man enough for this?
And what it was, is it was an Xbox with a deep fryer attachment.
And that was the problem with the original Xbox, is it was too butch.
But the Xbox 360... And the controller was just too fucking big!
The Xbox 360, you know, it's still butch, you know, it's not gay, but it's a little fruity.
And that's okay.
It's got like Viva Pinata.
No, you go first.
I was this close, actually, to getting my boyfriend the Xbox 360.
I'm too good.
I got my ex a PSP for Christmas.
I was this close to actually getting my boyfriend a 360, because that's what he loves, because he loves the Xbox for Christmas, but...
JV Mon sums it up perfectly.
The 360 is metrosexual.
Not to, I hate going back to the, well no I don't, but not to go too much back to the gay issue, but I get a magazine called The Advocate, which is basically a gay and lesbian magazine specifically.
Is that GLAAD's agenda?
I am a gay gamer, I'm not the biggest fan of GLAAD, because sometimes they get their panties ruffled too easy.
I don't know who it was, but they were talking about how video games are starting to bring more of that in, and they were talking, like Bully was one of them, Sims 2, but they talked about Gears of War, like the two main characters, like no one can convince me that those two characters are not boning each other.
Well, look, one of the achievements is called I Wish I Knew How to Quit You, or like Dom Curious, I don't remember what it was called, something like that.
Oh no, I thought it was like, I can't quit you, Dom, or something like that.
It's one of the achievements in Gears of War.
There's subtleties there.
Meg's giving me huge shit about it.
It's like, they are not!
It's nothing major.
It's just an LOL moment.
It's not trying to make a statement or anything.
Like, oh...
Cliffy B is like secretly a gay supporter.
Maybe he is.
Who cares?
It's a video game.
Who cares?
I can't tear away my boyfriend from Gears of War at Best Buy.
Does that make him kind of gay?
You've contaminated your microphone with gay.
Because I'll totally go for the guy that said he'd marry me for liking that adventure game.
I got gay from Rob a long time ago with the Pepsi bong.
All right, anyhow.
At Golfland.
And I'm being asked by several people, please tell me you aren't a crab person.
No, well, both of us, because we're both gay.
Did you ever see that episode of South Park with the crab people?
Queer Eye?
Never mind.
Do we ever talk video games on this show?
Yes, we do once in a while, and this is a very interesting sort of game that's coming to the DS.
There's a new brand of toys in Japan called Treasure Gaust, and it's going to be coming to the DS.
Well, get this.
You remember how, like, Boktai used sunlight, and there was another game in Japan that used barcodes?
Take your DS to a power plant.
Take it to a power plant.
Or get a blacklight in your house because that thing will send that thing off the rockets.
I wonder if a fridge magnet will fuck with this game.
Do they have those stones that make noise?
So there you go.
Treasure Gauss coming to the DS.
Boy, the DS now really does everything.
Well, that's kind of cool, though, because it's like degaussing your monitor.
It's certainly something new.
Well, here is something new, but not really.
We get more Harvest Moon.
Duh, award of the week.
Harvest Moon DS will be out on the 13th of April I know at least in the UK I'm not sure if that's also applying to the US because I got my information off of UK stuff however it's more cows and more sheep and you get tutorials on how to raise your animals and plant seeds and crops and make money on your farm fall asleep while playing a video game
and have sex with Harvest Sprites and the Witch Princess.
I'm awake.
No, really.
And then you can actually get married in the game.
You have 25 villagers and you can go fishing.
All they'll do is just nag you to fucking tend to the animals.
You can probably, you know, hump the sheep or something.
All they do is stay at home and watch Oprah while you're out milking the cow.
I have a Harvest Moon sheep.
I do.
I do.
He sleeps by my bed with Stitch.
Gaming Nerd says, I'm buying this game.
Whee!
There you go.
Anyways, um, so... John Dorian says, I think Harvest Moon for the DS already came out.
I think... I don't know if this is a new one.
I think this is a new one.
Wow.
I mean, there's a new Harvest Moon game every year on every platform, so, you know, it's the same fucking thing every time.
I'm sorry, I'm not a big Harvest Moon fan, if you can't already tell.
I find the game to be incredibly boring, yet I love Animal Crossing.
So obviously, my taste in games is fucked.
I admit it, okay?
Evangelicals love Animal Crossing.
Evangelicals love Animal Crossing?
I don't know why.
Why would Evangelicals... You should have seen the shit we were doing in Animal Crossing.
I got one of my animals to always say, you cunt, after everything they said.
Can I have a fish, you cunt?
And then, like, we painted gay pride symbols and put them all over town.
Remember the girl in my village who was their village lesbian?
My Animal Crossing village was an evangelical nightmare.
On my DS one, though, we had our village lesbian, and when she moved out, we cried.
No, I remember that.
I remember that.
Because she moved to Julie's village.
It's because I hit her with a bug net so much.
She moved to Julie's village.
And she was a PE teacher.
She had gym equipment.
That's right.
She had gym equipment in her house.
She was such a lesbian.
And so we made a little rainbow sign to be outside of her house.
Do you know why Animal Crossing is sick?
Because we're talking about these people like they're real.
You know you liked Olivia.
That's the one I think I got to say you cunt after everything.
There's nothing funnier than getting video game characters to say shit and poop.
Yay!
How about Pee Pee Kaka?
Anyway.
I had one that said that.
So, Capcom.
Yeah, they're awesome.
And they used to have a studio called Clover, which put out such games like Okami, Beautiful Joe, fun stuff like that.
Well, of course, you remember Clover went buh-bye.
Dekki Kamiya
And I probably butchered those names.
But it should be interesting.
Hopefully we get some more original games, kind of like... Actually, they worked on... What was it?
Gunhand?
I think that was the name of that.
Godhand, that's what it was.
That was okay.
But yeah, awesome.
More studios making more games.
I have, on another completely different tangent, I have the news that might save PlayStation 3.
And here it is.
There's a rumor going around that there are, because based off reports from Japan, that the head of the Sony Financial Division is suggesting that a PlayStation 3 price cut in 2007 may be on the way.
Now it seems like there's a story about this like every other week, but this one's really been circulating around the different blogs, so we hope there's a little bit of truth to it, but the honest end of it is, if there is a price cut coming, it's probably not until Christmas.
because they'll try to lie to fire under PS3 sales.
They're going to have to because Halo 3 is going to be a big problem.
I would say if they want to be smart, they'll cut the price of the PlayStation 3 the same day as the Halo 3 comes out.
That would be the best thing ever.
We'll see what happens.
Well, as for other things that we're seeing happening, and I really wish we weren't seeing this happen, there's an Aqua Teen Hunger Force game on the PS2.
And this is what you get for drinking beer milkshakes.
Yeah.
It's a golfing game.
I know.
It's just... Extreme combat golf, they call it.
Whose story is this?
Well, I'm just hoping.
Interesting.
Can I say something?
Okay, tell us more about the game, Jamie.
Go right ahead.
Can I say something completely random first?
Yeah.
Jamie likes to do that to my stories.
This has nothing to do with gaming at all, but you know how in Rocky Horror Picture Show at the end, you always have, like, if you ever go see it live in the theater, when Riff Raff and Magenta come back into the, they're sometimes dressed up as famous couples or some type of coupling.
Like, you know, maybe they'll come, like, I remember one time when I actually performed as Riff Raff, we came out as the characters from Brokeback Mountain.
and, you know, just like couples like that.
Well, last night, they came out in these giant cardboard cutouts of Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
And it was the best gold scene I'd ever seen in my life.
Dinner is papayas!
Something like that.
Sorry, that random moment was brought to you by... I was just sort of in shock because I'm like, it's bad enough that it's Aqua Teen Hunger Force, but they have to just completely turn the state in my heart and making it combat golf with sawed-off shotguns.
Midway, stop taking the LSD, please.
You are not a hero.
You cannot tell the future through Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
Lay off the drugs.
Next, please.
I want to read some comments from chat real quick.
Going to, let's see, back to the PlayStation 3 story.
Let's have T says, PlayStation 3 needs a price cut.
That's the only way that it might become a real threat to Microsoft.
SSJ100 Matt says, Aqua Teen Hunger Force game.
The only game that won't be in Boston.
To which WB Bulldogs tags along to that.
The Boston Scare was a bunch of bullshit.
Media blowing things out of proportion.
Got the show a lot of visibility, although I hear it didn't help in the ratings.
That's too bad.
The ratings are doing pretty good as it is.
I mean, yeah, the show is doing fine as it is, so what can you do?
Anyways.
Cool!
Mikotov's going to let me borrow Hotel Dusk.
I've been wanting to play this.
You mean book.
You can't have the game.
He's loaning it to me.
Oh, game list!
You know, every time you...
Every time I'm on this frickin' show, you say that, Rob.
Every single time.
It doesn't mean anything, I swear.
Heart... Broken.
Oh, okay, I get to read a story now.
That's great.
Anyways, apparently the team behind Ico is working on a brand new title for the PS3.
People are hoping that it's a brand new version of Shadow Colossus or even Ico.
Um...
Although it's probably going to be something original that looks yet very similar to both those two games.
So, no word on what it is, but we know that they're working on something.
There's something coming soon.
You gotta love gaming news like that.
Something is coming.
Something is coming to the PlayStation 3 and it's got a big schnauzer.
It's Q-Bert, you perverts.
Qbert's coming to the PlayStation 3 on February 22nd.
Hey, that's this week.
$4.99, undercutting the cost of the average Microsoft game by one cent.
Good job, Sony.
And, of course, Qbert will have the online leaderboards.
It's going to be in 720p.
And apparently players will be fighting against each other to see who can be the supreme noser.
Because that's the number one person on the leaderboard is the supreme noser.
I'm sorry.
Q-Bert jumped the shark when they had the Q-Bert cartoon, although that was kind of cool.
But I do love the Q-Bert game.
I do love the fact that Sony can't really say anything about their PlayStation Network right now because there's nothing on it!
Nothing!
There's nothing on there.
There's like six games and a few demos and that's it.
To be honest, the fucking Nintendo Network has more stuff on it than the Sony Network does.
I mean, come on.
Put out some more shit.
I don't care if this is stuff that's already been on the 360 or whatever.
More games.
Seriously.
More demos.
I mean, ooh, full auto 2 demo.
Only months after the game came out.
Hooray.
And you know what?
The game still sucks.
And I don't know.
They just need more shit.
Qbert is not filling the void that they need.
More original stuff.
And no PSP ports.
Stop it with the goddamn PSP ports.
Well, why don't we move away from Sony's stinky poop pile of a camp and go to the Nintendo World?
Although this is actually pretty poopy, too.
Cooking Mama Cook-Off has actually been pushed back.
Sorry.
In Europe.
Sorry, Europe.
The original release date was March 29th.
Now it's pushed back to May 10th.
They are not listing a reason.
That's really crappy, isn't it?
Don't worry, Europe.
Mama will fix it.
Had to, sorry.
We love you, Europe.
Even though we don't like the band.
Okay, well, you know, news of Cooking Mama getting delayed, even if it doesn't directly affect us here in the U.S., we feel your angst, our listeners overseas.
We feel your angst, and therefore we dedicate this podcast
FUs of the week segment to our overseas listeners.
DarkSakura, start us off with the angst.
Fuck you to accidents.
Because I banged my wrist into a big metal pole today and I have this big bruise and now I have this big swollen scald on my hand from your freaking T, Rob.
You didn't have to.
But it was yummy, thank you.
I didn't buy it.
Oh, thank you.
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, um, F you to having to pay $800 to buy a massage table.
Loki!
Um, I don't really have anything other than, I guess, um, F you to people that can't, you know, abide by street dates.
You know, I know that's a bit, you know, hypocritical, but yeah.
It's an exception, because you see, the rules state that you cannot sell it, rent it, or make it available to the public in that form.
Playing it is not on there.
Playing it is okie-dokie, so that's all I did is play it.
I didn't sell it or rent it, so I'm off scuffery.
But anyways, other people though, even people that should know better, like some of the comp USA's and EB games out there,
There's a big fucking sticker on it that says do not sell before 2.20.
Don't be a dumb fuck.
I mean, you're not getting paid that much money to do your job.
And I mean, honestly, no one gives a shit if you have the game, you know, days before everybody else.
Everyone's going to forget it, you know, down the line anyway.
So, who gives a crap?
But I need more people to buy this game so I can play with them online.
Because it's going to be fun.
I'm thinking about it, but $60 is a lot to spend.
I mean, look how much I played Gears of War.
It's fun.
It really is fun.
I'll think about it.
You've got to bring your copy over second place.
All right.
My view of the week goes to my voice, because I'm losing it again, and that sucks.
Because, you know, for those who say I talk too much on this show, do realize I'm used to talking all day and getting paid for it for a living in the teaching world.
So, yeah, losing my voice and having to go to my day job tomorrow is going to kind of suck.
Luckily, I could just give my class a test.
I'm off, Rob.
Well, you suck.
I'll be at home enjoying my day off for you.
Good.
You have fun with that, bitch.
All right.
I mean, I love you.
Where's that?
Your inaugural FUs of the week.
What do you want to angst on?
Oh, yeah, I get to break my FU of the week theory.
It's funny because, as my friends like to say after work, I love to get my hate on.
But I'm having such a good time being up here up north of NorCal Rules.
and SoCal's Rules, even though I'm an LA native.
But my fuck you of the week is so funny because I hate, I hate, I love to get my hate on.
Let it all out, baby, let it all out.
Let it all out.
I'm like, seriously, what can I say?
I guess my F you of the week, you go to my ex-boyfriend, not because I'm bitter, okay, I am a little bit, but because he has every reason.
Which one?
Oh, not him.
Oh, because I was going to say that one you have never seen.
Oh, F.U.
of the week to him, too, but David, a.k.a.
S.Kalian, big gamer nerd, and he likes to make anime music videos.
Uh-oh.
What if he listens to the show?
He probably does.
That's why I'm doing it.
Oh, boy.
And instead of going out, which is okay, because I would pay for everything anyway, and I got on the PSP, because you know why?
Because I'm the best ex-girlfriend ever.
But we used to play...
And last but not least, some lesbian FUs from Chris.
I have two quick ones.
I won't be too long.
One, F you to the Scientology Center for fucking roping my father into it.
Leave my father alone.
He's old, he's bitter, and he has money.
Knock the fuck off.
I'm so sick of it.
And F you to the week to me.
Because... You're awesome.
Yeah, but... I don't... I wish I could do more...
I know I rant about something every week around here with Meg D, but she lives in Wisconsin.
She goes to school full time.
She's at work part-time and she's got ASUN coming up where she's being in costume and stuff like that.
And she's just so stressed out.
And I F you to me for not being able to do something to help her more.
You know what?
She's obviously got a gal who loves her very much.
And a lot of people in this world are not that lucky.
So that's what you can give.
I just wish I could do more for her.
Thanks for watching!
Wow.
She'll enjoy that.
Somehow we went from I love my girlfriend so much to fuck you, Maisie.
Fuck you right in your ear hole.
She knows I love her.
I bought her a pink leather collar.
I love Maisie, too.
She's great.
I'm sorry.
I have one last fuck you of the week, and that's to Gears of War for hypnotizing my boyfriend.
He never wants to leave the fucking best buy.
Oh, Gears of War.
So, yeah.
Anyone else?
I need a new boyfriend.
Any volunteers?
It's a popular game.
Well, I don't swing that way, but I'll pose in pictures and stuff so you can tell your family.
What, at Disneyland?
Yeah.
I love you to death, but you're gay and you act it!
I am not gay!
What are you talking about?
How can anyone mistake you for her husband?
Sorry.
Alright, I'm done.
Back to gaming news.
Because they couldn't hear him talk in the picture.
In fact, on my MySpace, Chris left me a comment where I'm holding the gay lightsaber from Disneyland.
I had it in my big one.
It says, use the gay force, Rob.
Oh, I need to add that to my pictures now that I have 300 pictures, so I'm going to do that.
Alright, sorry.
Gaming news.
Anybody, somebody, help.
Anyways, so...
Out of all the retarded shit that come out for gamers, this has to be up there with some of them.
Headshot, the energy bar.
Yes, you too can buy a fucking energy bar called Headshot and be uber cool because you eat fucking energy bars that have to do with gaming while you're gaming.
Ooh, you're fucking awesome.
And, you know, while you're at it, I want you to wash that Headshot down with some balls.
Ooh, that sounds like fun!
Come on, Jamie, I know I'm your husband, but can I drink some balls?
I'm going to get hate mail from GLAAD, even though I'm gay.
Isn't that ironic?
We should tell Mr. Spanky about that.
Alright, anyhow.
Yeah, headshot.
Wow, that's something else.
Oh, and that was the other thing.
I believe...
It was this website, UncommonLoot.com, that was running the story about that.
It looks so awful.
It probably tastes like ass, too.
Some people like the taste of ass.
You like ass?
Well, we have the drink for you.
Wasn't there a drink on English.com or something that was A-S-S-E or something?
It was a type of candy.
Pocari Sweat's actually really good.
Wait, what was I going to say?
Um...
Oh, Rob D in chat said, if Rob and Jamie were married, one of them would be dead by now.
So true.
That would be Rob.
So true.
Well, really?
All right.
Anyhow, let's get into some PC gaming news, because I know it's been a pretty interesting show tonight with some very random stuff, but there's nothing more hardcore than PC gaming, because seriously, PC gamer fans are like, they're like, fuming at the mouth hardcore.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Mist Online went live this week.
This is a game a lot of folks have been like, ooh, even Marissa's casting it.
No, Mist is not dead.
Through the service GameTap, you can play Mist Online.
It's $9.95 a month for GameTap, and you get access to like hundreds of games, not just this.
And it launched on February 15th.
Now, right now, it's only available to GameTap subscribers, but apparently they're going to make the game available as like a direct download in other countries.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No, I actually really want to check this out.
I'm going to really try to play this and review it for next week's show because I keep saying, oh, I've got to play Salmon Max.
I really need to spend some quality time with GameTap.
Salmon Max, yay!
But I keep going back to WoW because it's crack.
Salmon Max, yay!
War crack.
Sorry.
Anyway.
Well, just a little bit of information.
For fans of Gears of War who have a PC, it's eventually going to be on the PC.
It was actually confirmed by Epic's VP, Mark Raine, said that it's not just a rumor, it's going to happen, just not soon.
He just said it's inevitable.
I guess it's not a really big surprise.
I mean, you know, it's one of Microsoft's biggest, if they want
More people to come over to the PC bandwagon.
Why not put something out for those that don't have the 360?
Gears of War is a huge title.
Makes perfect sense.
I don't know why it took them this long to simply acknowledge it.
Anyways, so there's going to be a brand new action-oriented role-playing game coming out to the PC.
Silverfall by Atari and Monte Cristo Games is finally gone gold.
It's scheduled to be released on March 20th.
and will retail for $39.95.
It actually looks pretty cool, kind of a little fantasy mixed with technology type of role-playing game.
I guess it's kind of like a Final Fantasy.
Plus, the cover has boobs on it, so you gotta buy it because of the boobies.
What do you think, Jamie?
Let me see.
Not bad.
She probably has back problems.
Glory's, Glory's, Boobs!
So there you have it.
So where the Wii does not have a camera, now you're going to get this on the Xbox 360.
That's going to be interesting.
It's going to work fantastic.
Yeah, I know.
Those camera games are not that great.
Just like the eye toy.
But Rayman's Raving Rabbids doesn't exactly have a lot of, like, I would think in translating some of those games, there's not a lot of motion-intensive stuff in that game.
You know what I mean?
Like, I can't imagine there would be that much motion.
There's a lot of motion going on in that game.
Never mind.
Forget it.
Just don't buy it.
It's a horrible game.
Alright, I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Let's see.
Let's go on to DarkSakura's website of the week.
I was trying to see if there was good chat comments.
Sorry if I sounded sidetracked.
No, they're talking about breasts.
They're all talking about boobs.
Although, I do have to say, holy shit, it's boobs get in the car from GS68.
My rebuttal to that was going to the Boobs BRB.
All right, well, I also want to hear your rebuttal to the website of the week, because every week DarkSakura surfs the website up and down and left and right to find her favorite website.
I don't know if it will be Doctor Who related this week.
We will soon find out.
Here we go.
Yes, she does surf the website up and down.
I say the web... Shut up.
The website of the week is the Orange Ons Radio Forums.
No.
Um...
You know, Rob, stop the music.
Stop the music.
The website of the week is very personal to me.
Very important.
You know, I think that we're forgetting the presence of greatness in our lives.
We should all bow down and pay homage to our Lord and Master.
The Flying Spaghetti Monster Oh my god, yes So the site dedicated to our noodley lord master I am a pastafari and I must confess Blessed be his noodley goodness, ramen The site is What the fuck happened to this show?
Seriously, what fucking show am I on?
In the name of the noodle
I love carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates are so good.
The site is www.venganza.org for a little bit of history.
The great one was discovered through a series of detections along the same lines as intelligent design.
And if intelligent design can't exist, why can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster?
Just for a brief commercial for Pastafarianism, our heaven has a beer volcano and a stripper factory.
So I recommend that everybody, or just worship the IPU, whatever, just go visit the site and soon you will become one of us.
Because, hey, if, you know, Scientology exists, why can't the Flying Spaghetti Monster exist?
Wait, there's actually a million dollar prize if you can prove that the Flying Spaghetti Monster does not exist.
There's no way to do it.
No.
In fact, there's tons of photographic evidence on the site.
Yeah, like drawings.
So... No, there's real life pictures.
If we go out to dinner at the Olive Garden, and I decide I don't like my food, because Olive Garden's food does taste a little bit, you know... It's an insult to Italians.
I...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
This has the best Valentine on it.
It says, I love you, but you must die.
Rob, the best part about Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is that we have flimsy moral standards.
Can I get gay married in Pastafarian?
Absolutely.
Can't you be ordained in Pastafarian?
You can be ordained in anything.
God bless Pastafarian.
That's it.
I'm a registered minister in California.
Wasn't that from an episode of South Park?
By the end of March, I will be an ordained minister of Pastafarianism.
Wait a minute.
This was in an episode of South Park where Mrs. Garrison says something about the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
I remember this distinctly.
It came about when someone was trying... The whole thing with the... Intelligent design.
Intelligent design.
You know, God invented the Earth and that kind of thing, and they're trying to teach it in schools.
It's like, that's bullshit.
It's not science.
Whatever you may believe, it's not science.
It's not science.
There's nothing to back it up.
So these guys said, well, shit, we might as well have a pasta creature that can fly around and, you know, has a beer volcano in his head.
And they use the same type of disjointed argument, the intelligent design.
Every time you talk about a spaghetti monster, I think about Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs.
Yeah!
He ate himself.
I actually think that Pizza the Hut is one of the avatars of his noodley goodness.
It was fully inspired, I think.
It's a funny site.
Go see it.
God damn it.
I have been touched by the noodley appendage.
My heart is open.
We'll be changing the name of the show from Orange Lounge Radio Video Game Radio to Orange Lounge Radio from what the fuck ever.
Sorry, Rob.
No, it's alright.
It's funny.
It's alright.
Last week was just as bad.
Folks in chat seem to be digging it, so whatever.
As long as they're happy, Rob.
As long as they're happy.
That's right, as long as the masses are pleased.
I mean, seriously, we can't talk about video games all day long.
I mean, you have to have a life outside of games.
Really?
Or else when will you ever get an orgasm?
Seriously.
Whee!
Whee!
I found... I'm not going to say that on air.
But we are going to get back into some gaming news.
I'm not going to say that on air.
Are we?
Loki, yes?
Yes, if someone gives me a microphone.
Anyways, so the wonderful game that I've been playing, Crackdown, it only has 900 assuming points.
It is missing 100 of them.
I know.
Everyone pause.
That's tragic news, but they are coming later on in a free downloadable thing.
What they're going to be doing for the last 100 points, well, they don't really know yet.
What they're doing is watching how people play the game,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't think there is a lobby in this game.
I know Loki likes Crackdown a whole lot, but there's only a few things I can think of that are even better than Crackdown.
Loki must agree.
And one of them would be zombies.
And there's really... Hell yeah, I love zombies.
There's only really one thing... What?
Loki disagrees.
Zombies are not better than Crackdown?
No, they're not.
Well, okay.
Crack is better than Crackdown.
No, you're wrong.
That's okay.
There's only one thing better than zombies, believe it or not, and that would be Hideo Kojima.
And would you believe...
That the meeting of this awesomeness, these two worlds of awesome, could be in the near future.
Hideo Kojima spoke to Edge Magazine and said the following, quote, of course Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid, blah, blah, blah.
Quote, the zombie idea I have is a bit different.
Imagine a large town where half the inhabitants are zombies.
Users would subscribe, get inside the town, and get bitten.
At that stage, they become undead and can't control their character.
All they can do is modify the camera angles.
They would see their character attacking humans and have to pay to just watch.
The only way they could end it is by opening another account, hunting themselves down, and killing themselves.
Of course, the problem is that your second character can get bitten as well.
Wasn't this already done in a Resident Evil game?
I think of Infected for PSP.
No, there was, I want to say a Resident Evil game that was played online.
Outbreak?
Yeah, I think it might have been Outbreak.
Hideo Kojima Adventures in Nudie Island Half The Residence Hot Naked Chicks
Okay?
You would have people subscribing four times just to have four different people in this fucking island.
And I tell ya, that is gonna be better than any fucking zombie game ever.
Beauty and the Geek MMO?
And you know what happens?
And if you get bitten by the naked chicks, you know, if you're into that kind of thing, then you turn into another naked chick or something.
Isn't the downside, though, that half of those quote-unquote naked chicks are men playing as naked chicks?
That would be me.
Girls don't play video games.
I always play women in MMOs, always.
That's why, I don't know, the naked chicks would be only controlled by AI, so it'd never be men playing.
Oh, so you're never actually having real sex, ever.
Doesn't matter, you're never having real sex in this game anyways.
If you want real sex, go and fucking get a woman.
Festering Rash in our chat, which I believe is just DMN under a different name, says, Loki, it's called Second Life.
Touche!
Not lesbians.
Sorry, Chris.
But, like, you know, hardcore, like, guy-on-guy action.
No, I said Chris.
No, not Shane.
I'm sorry you're here.
Alright.
I love one-sided conversations on the radio.
So professional.
Anyhow.
Shall we move on?
Why not?
You know what?
I have better things to do.
No, I'm kidding.
For everybody who was...
into Amplitude who played Amplitude Online.
Sony is giving the online server the boot right at the ass.
The Amplitude online server is going away.
It will be, I believe actually was it down now?
It went off on Sunday, right?
I think today was the last hurrah.
7pm Eastern Time, so it's gone already.
Aww, that's sad, kinda.
That's so sad that a game that's a few years old loses its online content.
Buy a new game!
How about they make one as good as Amplitude?
That would be awesome.
Give me Guitar Hero Online.
You jerk.
I don't care if Marissa hates Guitar Hero, I'd play it.
I liked Amplitude and I did play it online.
Of course, not
Not in two years, but lately I have, Chris.
Okay, this is not the Let's Cry About Rob Not Getting Laid show.
Hey, guess what?
What?
If you thought that Gran Turismo HD was an awesome preview of what Gran Turismo 5 may be someday, whenever the fuck it comes out, well, guess what?
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is coming out later this year, and it's supposed to be
Yet another fucking demo of what Gran Turismo 5 is going to be.
Hurrah.
And actually they were saying that if, I think the original Gran Turismo 4 prologue, you actually have to buy that.
So, I don't know.
Great, another fucking demo of Gran Turismo.
Guess what?
The first one sucked.
I didn't like it.
The second one?
Probably not going to download it.
Gran Turismo 5?
Probably not going to buy it.
So, hooray.
James Patrick in chat commenting on the MMO thing says, Mass Effect will probably have gay romance.
Is Sky looking forward to that?
No, because as I said earlier, I always play chicks in MMOs because everybody's nicer to you when you're a chick in an MMO.
And I don't want to do a lesbian thing.
That's gross.
Yeah, World of Warcraft people.
Yeah, but first of all, fuck you.
Second of all... Right now?
Yeah, right now, Rob.
Punch fans back on.
I just think that's a part of the history of the internet, because my father...
I almost want to make a gay.com account right now impersonating as a woman I'll put Chris's picture as my profile or something
and go into a chat room and put, hey, lezzies.
See what happens.
We were going to do that for my ex-boyfriend, who is so totally gay, as an April Fool's joke, put his profile and his address and stuff.
That's so wrong.
He needs help admitting his gayness.
Yeah, okay.
This show is very gay today, I'm sorry.
The first step is admitting you're gay.
We already did that.
1-877-GAME-OLR is only local in the United States and Canada, meaning that's where it's only toll free.
If you are abroad in another country, we encourage you to download Skype and call us on our username, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
They're all going to call in for Marissa.
We'll see what happens.
Let's go to the first call, boys and girls.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Did I not actually pick up a call?
My bad.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DT?
Say no.
My husband will hunt you down.
Kind of.
He says kind of.
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.
Dan will step on you.
He's a groupie that respects boundaries.
Yeah.
That's fair.
I prefer fanboys.
All right.
Well, what kind of games have you been playing this week, Dark Tetsuya?
Just stuff on the league.
There must have been something that compelled you to pick up the phone and call in.
Was there a story tonight that particularly touched a nerve with you?
Well, the AOU stuff.
Ah, the arcade stuff we talked about in Part 8, like the Silent Hill game and DDR Supernova.
What do you think of all that?
Oh, it sounds pretty cool.
I'm stoked about Supernova 2.
Yeah, did you think Supernova was a real, like, did it kind of rescue the DDR series?
I think so.
Very cool.
What features would you like to see new in Supernova 2?
I mean, just new songs, or what would you like to see Konami do with Supernova 2?
Well, except in the new song, they should probably put in the link mode.
Ah, link mode.
Ah, so like you can use your memory card from the home version on the arcade.
That's a good idea.
Hopefully it'll happen.
Do you like to track your data?
Yeah.
Actdeft, who changed his name to ActdeftMarissaFan in chat, says remember to put in link mode.
There you go.
Very cool.
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dr. Tsuyo?
I just thought that Silent Hill game was cool.
Yeah, it does.
Do you think Silent Hill's going to work as a first-person shooter?
It might.
I guess we'll see when we play the game, huh?
Yeah.
Do you think the graphics look okay?
I mean, DarkSakura was kind of knocking the graphics earlier, saying that PlayStation 2 had better graphics.
What do you think?
Right.
No, no, they look pretty good.
Kind of atmospheric.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think Silent Hill's going to suck as a first-person shooter.
Why do you think it's going to suck as a first-person shooter?
I don't know.
It's just not going to be atmospheric enough, I don't think.
Do you think it's going to fall into the same pattern that the Resident Evil Gun Survivor games did?
Yes, definitely.
You know, I actually liked the second one.
I got to play the Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, and I thought it was pretty cool, but...
I'm really trying to reserve my judgment for actually playing it.
I just love Silent Hill.
But nah, I like the atmosphere and the whole ambience about it.
I don't think it'll work.
What do you think would make it cool?
Apart from Pyramid Heads.
But it has nurses!
I don't know.
I'm just not a really big fan of first person shooters, I guess.
So if you were going to design a Silent Hill arcade game, how would you make it?
I probably wouldn't make one, to be honest.
Fair enough.
Alright, well, I think you have a fan here in studio who wanted to say hello to you, Sesha, since you called in.
Go ahead and say hello.
Hi, hot, sexy British guy.
That's Rice Princess, by the way.
Hey, Rice Princess.
How's it going?
Good.
I'm really tired, actually.
It's 5 a.m.
Oh, my God.
Aw, and he stayed up to listen to us.
No, to listen to us, right?
Princess, not you.
Okay, I'm going to go and cry in a corner.
Not true.
He did ask about her.
Aw, that's so sweet.
And he's all sexy.
You guys should add each other on MySpace or something.
Oh, my God, we totally should.
Do you use MySpace, Sesha?
Yeah, I do.
Oh, type it to Sky in the chat room.
He's on my friends list.
Oh, is he?
Really?
Well, now.
All right.
Well, there you go.
You don't have a girlfriend that's going to get pissed if you're talking to Rice Princess online, are you?
No.
Okay.
All right.
There you go.
Sweet.
All right.
Because she loves Silent Hill and could talk all about the first person games with you, I guess.
I don't know.
Yeah.
All right.
She might convince me.
Oh, hey.
So, I've got a bet going now.
Why, what's that?
I bet Irene can convince.
Oh, man.
I'll give you $50.
No, I'm kidding.
Which is like next to nothing in pounds, right?
Yeah, that's totally nothing at all.
See you guys.
Bye, sexy British guy.
Have you ever even seen a picture?
No, I don't care.
He sounds hot.
That's very not superficial of you.
That's very nice.
I know.
No, he sounds really hot, dude.
I saw his picture.
He's cute.
Note to all guys.
I think he's cute.
Get fake British accents.
It'll work.
Well, next week on Orange Sounds Radio, we're going to be talking about... Instant softie there.
Hello.
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
Is that what I'm doing wrong?
Is that why I can't get laid?
Is that why I haven't had a date in so long?
Well, let's go to another call, shall we?
Hello, you're on Tea with Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Oh god, that voice turned me on.
Hi, DMN!
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you.
Hi, DMN.
Right now!
Hi, everybody.
Hi!
You had to come to my birthday party, you bastard.
I'll try.
Okay.
Something about Crackdown I actually wanted to talk about.
Alright, what's that?
I don't know if any of you guys heard, but a Halo 3 demo came with Crackdown.
No, no, no, no, careful.
Don't call it a demo.
It's a beta.
Bill Gates will personally come sodomize you if you call it a demo.
It doesn't come with a demo.
It will be available for download later.
But here's the thing I don't get is that rabid Halo fanboys who wank off to Master Chief are basically saying, Oh my God, I have to pay $60 to play the beta.
It's a beta.
Yeah.
No you don't, you could have done all those other things like register and be drawn randomly or play Halo 2 for some amount of time and be the first 13,333 people.
Or you could unbunch your wedgie and just wait for the real game to come out.
And that's what I'm saying.
It's a beta test.
It's one of the first console games I've ever known of that's having a public beta test.
It's like I was saying earlier in the show.
Even though 11 billion people are in the Halo 3 beta, and I'm very sorry to Mike W. who was complaining earlier about being a Halo fan and being the only person not in the beta.
I'm not in the beta either, but I don't care.
For some reason, people want to be in this beta because it makes their internet penis bigger.
Because it's like, I was in the Halo 3 beta.
Well, you and half the internet.
It's pretty ridiculous.
Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, DMN?
Uh, STFU, we're looking for a guest.
Anybody who's listening live would like to be a guest.
We're taping Tuesday night, so shoot me an eye.
Why don't you have Rice Princess as a guest?
Oh, DarkSakura.
I want to, but I'm actually, and I was going to say something about that.
I forgot that my class that I thought was Friday is actually on Tuesday.
I'm actually taking chakra mapping.
Metaphysical shit.
At my massage therapy school.
Interesting.
Do you want me to manipulate your energy, DMN?
I don't have any energy today.
I ran out of it.
Why don't you have Marissa on?
She's welcome to come on if she wants.
Whee!
I say you get a bunch of girls on your show this week and see how you like it when you have more girls than guys on the show.
I see what you did there.
You kind of put your own show name in there.
All right.
Tune in to SCFU on Thursday nights right here on Orange Laundry.
It's 7 o'clock Pacific.
It's a good time.
Usually.
Have a good one, DMN.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Wait, do we have a picture?
Wait, is this a picture?
Yeah.
All right.
I want to see the British guy.
I know.
We all want to see.
Rice Princess ran over.
Let's see.
Let's see.
Oh.
British guy's hot.
He's kind of young.
Yeah, but he's still hot.
British guy is hot.
You're going to scare the poor guy off.
Dude, you're a pimp, man.
He's never going to come to chat again.
He's never going to come to chat again.
Look at his other pictures real quick.
All right.
Even Shane, like, randomly appeared out of nowhere.
I heard something about a British guy.
Dude, he's got... Okay, that's awesome.
He's got very nice eyes.
All right.
Anyway, can we go to another call?
May we please go to another call?
All right, let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Watch Radio.
Who's this?
No, my last name.
Hi, Rana.
It's not Ranma.
Is this Ranma?
Who is it?
It's Extover calling.
Shut up, Extover!
It's Extover calling from the living room.
I'm so not Ranma.
That's so funny.
Did I sound black?
No, I'm totally white.
Okay, the few times that I've been on this show and Ranma has called in, he's like scratchy like he's calling from his cell phone because his what's it called?
Get off the fucking phone!
Oh, that makes sense.
Anyway, bye!
Fucker.
No cookie!
I hate this show.
By the way, by the way, Marissa, Actdeft is now ActdeftMarissaFan.
Yay!
We gotta go, we gotta go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Taunch Radio.
Who's this?
Static.
Hello?
Can you hear us?
Okay, unfortunately that caller did not go through, and it was a new caller, and I feel bad that I had to hang up, but... No, you don't.
Well, you know, I just, you know, I appreciate new people taking the effort to call in, but unfortunately we couldn't hear you.
Maybe there was lag or something.
Actdeft says, heart, Marissa.
Heart, you too.
Here's also a PSA for any new caller from the show.
I know, and that's why I felt bad, because I wanted to hear from Uni.
Use the power of evil.
All right, that's all right.
We'll go to another call in the meantime.
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is a long-time listener, Dark Knight, rising from the dead.
Hi, Dark Knight.
Hi, it's DK.
It's been a long time since we heard from you, buddy.
What's on your mind?
Nothing much.
I thought I might give... Ooh, hold on.
I know.
Feedback's horrible, isn't it?
He's my southern buddy.
Okay, I'm good.
Yeah, I just want to give a little mini-review on Diddy Kong.
I saw it in the chat room earlier about it.
Please do.
I haven't played this game yet.
I'm curious if I should pick it up.
It's okay, but like they said, it's more like a rehash of the N64 version.
Really?
It seemed like a rehash of the N64 version.
The only difference is that some of the minigames will incorporate the use of the stylus.
Is it sort of like how Mario on the DS, the launch title, was just kind of Mario 64 with some extra frills?
Exactly.
Like I said, it was more of a rehash, if anything else.
Like when you're doing your turbo boost, you know how on the N64 one you usually hit the buttons?
To do the turbo boost on this one, you actually got to use the stylus to boost your level up to do the boost.
Well, would you recommend the game to others?
Yeah, no.
What was it?
Yeah, yes, no?
Yeah, you know?
Yeah, you know.
I mean...
Yes to some diehard fans, but if you've never played Diddy Kong before or something like that, you might want to pass.
So people that are expecting to play Mario Kart DS Part 2, they're going to be disappointed, you think?
Just about, if anything else.
Alright, well, so noted.
Anything else you want to comment on on tonight's show?
Like I said, it's been a long time calling the show.
I miss talking to y'all guys at times.
Well, we miss having you call in, so feel free to call us anytime.
You know where to find us.
Yeah, usually, though, I'm calling on Travis' show, and he can tell you that I have been a good appearance on that show lately.
Travis has a great show, and all the callers just enhance to that show, no matter how good or bad they are.
So it's a good time.
Especially since he has a NASCAR partner, so yeah.
That's Saturday nights on Orange Launch Radio, by the way.
Check it out.
Travis Donovan.
All right, Dark Knight, have a good one, and thanks so much for your call.
No problem.
You have a good night.
You too.
Later, guys.
Later.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
I like hearing from Dark Knight.
I like hearing from all our callers.
If you're wondering and you're sitting at home and asking yourself, why do the same people call in every week?
Because they can.
Orange Lounge Radio is an open forum.
And if you are sick and tired of hearing the same people every week on this show, as awesome as they are, you need to start calling in too.
And you can do that by listening to us Sunday nights live at 6 o'clock Pacific time.
Or you can leave us a voicemail at any time during the week.
We haven't had a lot of them lately, so we haven't had anything to play.
But 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number if you ever want to leave a voicemail.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey there, this is Let's Have Tea.
Hi, what's up, G?
Is that it?
Let's have tea.
Oh, let's have tea.
I thought he said, what's up, G?
Word, yo!
Did I fuck up that name?
My bad.
I actually had a little tea earlier.
What's on your mind, Let's Have Tea?
I was actually wondering what your thoughts was on the XNA thing.
On XNA, the amateur development studio for Xbox.
Anybody have a thought on this?
I talk too much on the show, so I'm deferring.
I have a thought that I really haven't cared too much about it.
But you're not really into the programming stuff.
You just want to play the game, right?
Oh, no.
I like seeing the behind-the-scenes stuff.
It's just I'm like... I guess maybe I'm too saturated right now.
Yeah, and maybe it's like for you... I go looking for behind-the-scenes stuff all the time.
I just got done watching behind-the-scenes of Silent Hill 3.
I think I would love to see...
I don't know a lick about video game programming.
XNA does nothing for me.
But I'm excited at the prospect of, you know, it's going to make original games because there's going to be independent developers, you know, one-man, two-man, three-man teams out there making their own games.
And I want to see some of those on, you know, Xbox Live and see what original content's out there.
I mean, look at some of the games that have been developed for the web that are starting to get big now.
You have Flow, Line Rider, you know, those types of things.
I think XNA could produce more stuff like that.
Oh yeah, definitely.
I'm on a few teams for 3D modeling and such.
Excuse me?
The 3D modeling is hard stuff, so.
I think we're having a little bit of lag and that happens because our internet's getting hammered here.
I guess I'll ask you one last question and hopefully you can make this out.
What would be your response to this question?
What do you hope XNA can accomplish in the next six months, a year?
I'm really looking forward to seeing more original content.
because most game developers now are too afraid of making something new rather than just continuing with sequels and such.
So XNA will be able to have independent developers and small online teams be able to make something new and original.
All right.
Well, good luck.
It sounds like you're doing some of that XNA stuff yourself.
So good luck to the things that you're modeling and all that.
And let us know if you work on any games that show up
I think that's a good idea, actually, because it seems like, to be vulgar, as I usually am, that games are just turning into long series of porns with the same name.
You know, Depressed Men 10.
Some original games would be nice, and again, I'm not well-versed in the PSP at all, but I actually gave it to my ex-boyfriend, being very stupid and very broken.
I forgot to get him a game as well, but he didn't care because he was excited about everything that was homebrew.
I have to say...
That is some amazing insight from a casual gamer that games are starting to sound like porn titles.
Because you're kind of right, and I've never thought about it that way before, but it's kind of true.
Cooking Mama.
Let's poke Mama's steak.
Mama likes hot, press that steak.
Let's have tea.
Thanks so much for the call, okay, buddy?
Of course.
Have a good one.
What's up, G?
What's up, G?
What's up, G?
What's up, G?
I played it once.
Lesbians love sheep.
I don't know what that means, but I don't even want to know.
I like my plushie from Harvest Moon.
But you don't really play the games?
Not really.
I used to just watch people play it, and I thought it was amusing.
You got one.
Are you a Harvest Moon player?
Yes, I am.
My sister and mom got me Harvest Moon More Friends of Mineral Town for Christmas.
And, seriously, that game is like crack.
I mean, my sister and I would play it just, you know, to like say, who's going to marry who or something.
It was really stupid.
Well, okay, try to sell me on this game for a minute, because I'm not a huge Harvest Moon person.
Why should I play Harvest Moon?
Well, you start out...
You're trying to save... Well, the first one I played, you are trying to save this town called Mineral Town.
And basically, if you take three years to sell as many crops as you can, bring as much reputation to the town, which is Mineral Town... Wait, I've got to play this game for three years?
No, the days last a few hours, right?
The days last for about ten minutes, to be totally honest.
And...
Well, it's kind of like that with the more friends of Miller Town, which you're basically playing as a female instead of a male.
And you can actually marry somebody on that game.
You can actually marry men when you're on the woman's version, and you can marry a woman on the men's version.
Lame.
No gay marriage.
Can you partner?
Can you get a civil union?
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
I played The Sims.
We're used to it.
We're used to it.
Alright, well, one more question for you, even though you're the one that called us.
What makes this game different from, like, Animal Crossing?
Well, you...
Okay, maybe the wrong person.
You don't have to go take the pink dresser from cat person's house to the dog person and then take a letter to the owl person.
You just grow shit and sell it.
And then you feed your dog.
I don't remember getting the sheep in Harvest Moon to say, you cunt.
Am I right?
That's totally true.
But you do have to comb your horse.
Yes, you do.
And you have to comb it all the time.
And kick your cow.
Do you get to tip the cows, though?
No, you can't.
I don't think you can.
Do you tip your cows?
No.
I don't think they give you that option.
Uni, I know your name is really simple, but I love it.
I just saw a thing with a unicorn today and I geeked out because of my girl.
If I remember right, isn't it based off of Yuna from Final Fantasy X?
Uh-huh, yes.
That was my DDR nickname back when I was playing in Rhode Island.
At least your teacher didn't name you.
A lot of girls that are into games seem to really enjoy Yuni.
I mean, not Yuni.
If they like Yuni, they sure do.
I mean, Yuna from Final Fantasy X.
She's like a role model for girls or something.
I'm actually a lot like her in real life.
You mean she's normal?
Yeah, I know.
Weird, huh?
There you go.
Not that there's anything wrong with the big boobies.
There's nothing wrong with the big boobies at all.
Yeah.
Anyways, I should let you guys go.
Yeah, thanks.
Thank you for the advice.
We love you, Uni.
All right, take care, Uni.
Thanks for the call.
We appreciate it.
Bye.
Bye.
All right.
I am so pathetic.
We'll probably do, like, one more call here on the show.
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can always call us on the old-fashioned Skype line or whatever you want to do.
What was Yuna from?
Final Fantasy X. I've not played that game.
You should.
It's a good game.
Well, I haven't been able to pick it up, so that's why.
I saw a unicorn today.
I was like, unicorns, and I saw her name.
A unicorn?
That is so fucking pathetic.
Wow, you're interesting.
Oh, my God.
But I love you.
Alright, let's do at least one more call here.
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.
Who's this?
It's Raven's Dolphin.
Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
What's on your mind, buddy?
I am the saddest attorney in the world.
I object to that.
Objection.
Overruled, motherfucker!
I am a legal secretary.
Well, thank you.
Alright, what is legally on your mind, dude?
Well, legally, I did get my hands on Phoenix Wright's Justice for All.
What'd you think?
I love it.
It is kind of like an attenuation of the game, but hey, it's Phoenix Wright, and you all should pick it up.
It's great.
Tell me what I'm in for if I've never played Phoenix Wright before.
What can I expect from Phoenix Wright, either the first or second one?
All right, this one, you know, Phoenix Wright's a text game, so you have to click a lot and read a lot, and you have to find clues and contradictions in the game.
And if you don't find things...
Things get a little hairy, you know.
If you mess up and show Judge the wrong kind of evidence, he will go, uh-uh, not true.
And he will go, bang.
And you'll look stupid.
Because the story is so insane and it's like Law and Order.
Have you ever played something like this before?
The story's so driven.
It's a very story-driven game.
You want to see how the story's progressing.
Like the Edgeworth trial, I'm not going to give away anything.
All I'm saying is, holy shit, holy shit.
So it's got a good story, like Law & Order, like an episode of Law & Order.
What about the girl with the whip?
Yeah.
What about the girl with the whip?
Oh my God.
Doesn't she make you miss things?
I like that girl.
I saw art stuff of her, and she was fucking hot.
Was that on, like, DeviantArt?
No!
Oh.
No, you do not go there for concept art.
You go there for porn, Rob.
What's the difference between a lawyer and a catfish?
What?
One's a scum-sucking bottom feeder, and the other's a fish.
Very nice, very nice.
Raven's dog.
Raven's dog.
Yeah, what else?
How did you fail?
I haven't heard this.
I love all games, but they almost produce too much show that I can't stay on top of it a lot.
So you have to kind of tell me, what were they saying?
Real quick.
Of course it was 360 fun because
You've got a bunch of hardcore gamers in there.
I'm not, well, I love everyone, but then, you know, if you put a bunch of hardcore gamers, they're going to pick the 360 because it's the best, and that's all I have to say.
And they ask me that, why does the graphics suck, and I go, they don't suck, it's because it's based off of GameCube architecture.
And then I defend it and say, the GameCube architecture is actually pretty strong, just look at Resident Evil 4.
I know, it's, you know, it's not like the graphics are bad.
It's just, it's gameplay versus graphics.
And that's not to say that the Xbox has crappy gameplay.
It's just that the Wii does something a little different.
They're different.
I don't, it's so hard to compare the two.
But, I don't know.
That's just my thought.
Because I love them both.
I'm totally a Wii 60 person.
I totally am.
That's me.
I'm not, I'm not sold on Sony.
I'm not sold on Sony yet.
At least this generation.
Last generation, I was totally an S2 fanboy.
Okay, that's it.
Yeah, we better go.
Take care, Ravenstolphin, though.
Have a nice one, and we appreciate you calling.
Okay, you too.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Well, I know a lot of people have been trying to get through tonight, and I apologize.
We're not going to be able to take everyone's calls.
We've run a little long in both segments, if you can't tell, so we've got to wrap it up.
Any last-minute stories here in studio?
Yes, actually.
Okay, what's up?
Just for anyone who is a fan of Darwinia, Uplink, or Defcon, Introversion is actually stating that they're planning on putting out console games.
They haven't really said much yet, but there is a little bit of speculation that Subversion might be heading that way, which is a game they're currently developing.
Alright.
Anyways, there's a rumor going on saying that the next channel possibly for the Wii would be the Nintendo Power channel.
I heard about this.
That's interesting.
I don't know.
I wouldn't buy Nintendo Power, so I guess this would be the only way I'd see it.
Anywho... You better have Howard and Esther.
There's also another rumor saying that a PS3 will be released to compete with the Xbox 360 Core unit.
It, too, will not feature a hard drive as well, and possibly lower the price down to $250. $250.
I guess that's kind of cool, because, I mean, you can probably find a laptop hard drive for pretty cheap.
But, whatever.
Also, Final Furlong is coming to the Wii.
For those who may not know Final Furlong, Final Furlong is a horse racing game.
It was in the arcade, and when you play it, it makes it look like you're fucking a horse.
That game was great!
Hence, we used to call it the horse sex game.
So, in this, I guess it would be... Hunt the horse.
You know...
So is this, say, the cowboy ride a horse?
Also, in another Grand Theft Auto negative story, apparently Richard O. Jones, a writer for Black Voice News, wrote concerns about racial stereotypes in video games.
One such video game he's kind of mad at is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, in which Jones...
It says it relates to the player who assumes the lead character of Carl Johnson, a down-on-his-luck black criminal who roams the city streets stealing cars and helping gang members knock off rivals in drive-by shootings.
Okay, but apparently he didn't play the other games where he played other ethnicities doing the same damn thing.
We all hate equally.
Sides.
Yeah, hate knows no color boundaries.
Everybody hates.
That should be the next Wii channel.
Not everybody votes, everybody poops, everybody hates.
It's just a big bitch board.
What do you hate right now?
I hate OLR.
What do you hate more than anything at this very moment, Rob?
This show.
Chris?
I'm just kidding, I love this show.
I want to see a Wii webcam channel where you can go visit other people's webcams.
The Wii porn channel.
For people who have Wiis.
Wii Wiis.
PornTube!
What I hate more than anything right now is the fact that PornTube upgraded their Flash Player so I can no longer use it on my Wii.
Sad, huh?
I know.
Anything else from anyone?
I guess that's it.
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts if we can.
First off, before we wrap up the show, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into and supporting Independent Podcast Radio.
You guys are awesome, and we do this show for you guys, the loyal ones who listen to us.
All we ask, if you like the show, you'll notice no ads on our site.
No, I mean, live 365 ads, we can't control that because we, you know, they pay the royalty fees, so that's a small concession, but it's the site itself, no ads, podcast itself, you know, no ads as it stands right now, and no plans in the foreseeable future, although someday we may have to make money.
But we do this show, the goodness of our hearts, all we ask, tell one person about Orange Lounge Radio.
Even if it's your...
Least favorite person in the world, tell them about Orange Lounge Radio so that maybe they'll check it out.
Because that's the only way we can promote, because we don't have the marketing muscle of magazines and television channels and all that stuff.
All we have is us and you guys, the OL Army.
So, even Marissa's ex.
All right.
So tell somebody about Orange Lounge Radio, and that's all we ask.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and it's like she's not having a happy time right now if she could she'd drop everything that she's doing and come out here to be less stressed but she's not she's sticking through school which was a really hard decision for her and stuff so if people can send out some good thoughts towards her go to her myspace or something give her a comment or something and make her happy just to let you know just to ease some of it because I think she needs it because I love her and she needs happy
Gaming Nerd says, God, why don't we all trade MySpaces so we can stalk one another?
You know, Orange Launch Radio has a MySpace, and you can add us.
It's MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
We're not hard to find.
But if you suck, I'm not adding you.
All right.
Thank you, and of course, you know, I love making... Speaking of you suck.
Marissa.
Yay!
Congratulations on your first full OLR episode.
And you know what?
Based on your comments you've been making, you're much more of a gamer than you lead on.
Yeah.
You follow this stuff more than you'd admit.
I...
You know more about gaming than I think you want to admit.
But thanks for coming and for your insight.
And what's your final thought?
Oh, yay, this is so much fun.
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for putting up with my ass.
And my last... Oh, yay, hugs from Eggsy.
My final thought would be...
People at me on MySpace.
I hate MySpace, I do.
To be perfectly honest with those that don't like it.
But it's unfortunately a necessary evil.
It is.
It really is.
I say the same thing.
It's where the internet goes to die.
That's true.
I thought that was 4chan.
That too.
It's like cake or death.
4chan or MySpace.
So yes, my final thought is yay.
Thank you to everybody, especially fans.
Even if you're just fans for my boobies, that's fine too.
It's radio though, so it's hard.
It's really big though.
They are really big.
If you like me or if you want to see my boobies, well, not naked.
www.myspace.com slash M-A-R-I-S-S-A-M-E-I-Z-E-L or if you don't like Myspace and it's Myspace bad, just like sunlight, M-A-R-I-S-S-A-C-O-N-G-U-S-T-O at gmail.com.
Email me.
Whatever.
Cool.
This was so much fun.
Thank you again.
No problem.
And we'll have to play some folk rock on a later episode of Orange Lounge.
Oh, I get so many good friends.
Give the listeners some culture.
I've played James Hurley on my show before.
James Hurley is awesome.
And James Lee Stanley is my favorite.
He has the best sideburns ever.
He does.
He has pointy sideburns.
You need to play a Marissa song on the next pop-up at the volume.
If Marissa would give me some.
Oh, yay.
And just to promote a friend, James Lee Stanley is an awesome musician who put a picture of me in a Jessica Rabbit outfit on his album.
She's got that on her MySpace, too.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
Thank you guys so much.
It was a blast.
No problem.
Thank you for coming.
And ease up on the Guitar Hero hate.
All right.
Loki, your final thought.
I got to play more Crackdown.
Two of the three gangs done.
One last one left.
The Asians are always the hardest to kill.
I don't even know how to take that comment or what kind of hate mail we're going to get from that.
Rice Princess, do you have a final thought?
I like British guys.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Kirby's my final thought.
DarkSakura.
If Megzi is listening by any chance, you fully have my sympathy because I am right now working full time, going to school 12 hours a week.
And actually this week I'm taking two extra classes and have to do 10 documented massages by the end of the year.
I'm sorry, by the end of March.
And then have to take more classes and then find a way to quit my job.
So I totally feel your pain.
I am suffering with you.
Megzi!
Okay, bye.
All right.
That concludes another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for supporting Independent Radio.
And next week, we'll talk about video games at some point.
We promise.
See you guys later.
