Orange Lounge Radio
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
And we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 221 for this February the 25th of 2007.
And we're here with part B of our podcast.
If it's your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you should dip back into our archives.
Visit www.orangeloungeradio.com.
You can hear the first half of this show where we talked about the virtual console and how Perrin Kaplan is always the introduction to the opposite sketch and much more.
We even took some calls, which is a rarity for part A.
So now we're going to get into part B, some more news.
DarkSakura is not here this week, but she'll be joining us for a tape segment in part B to do the mailbag, because we always welcome your emails at mailbag.orangelaunch.radio.com.
It is an interactive show.
It's not just about us.
I mean, we're just some schmoes on the internet like you.
We want to always welcome you guys to interact with the program.
We also have our chat room, hi chat room, waiting to interact with us.
Also in part B tonight, beat the host.
So Loki's looking forward to getting beat up a little bit.
If they choose me.
If they choose you.
Anyways.
So, apparently the rumor that Warhawk was going to be a download title is going to be true, I guess.
According to 1UP's Sam Kennedy, he apparently just recently was shown by Incognito the brand new Warhawk game, and it is going to be a download title.
And a quote from him, What Warhawk is apparently evolved into is a multiplayer-only title featuring ground-and-air combat that will be downloadable from the PlayStation Network.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
on the PlayStation Network.
Is it, you know, is it really this title's that weak that it can't be released retail?
Or is it just that, you know, the PlayStation Network doesn't have anything on it?
I mean, or a combination of the two.
Blaze doubts the truth behind this.
Blaze in the chatroom says 1UP is a tool of Satan, therefore they lie.
Very true, but, you know, I would take it if they're going and actually visiting the studio that...
You know, maybe this is the case.
But then again, you know, they haven't officially announced it yet, so I guess we could still call it rumor.
Would you buy this?
Nope.
Downloadable?
Not at all.
You know what, though?
I go, how much is it possibly going to be downloadable?
Maybe $25?
And then it would have been $60 as a retail title.
I'll have to see what the price is going to be on this, because I know one of the things that they're pushing is full downloadable games.
So if they're just going to test the waters with, you know, Warhawk, it better be good.
You know, I'll wait and hear the reviews on it, you know,
That'll determine whether I purchase it or not, because it's just like, you know, Q-Bert.
Q-Bert's a downloadable title, and just because it's downloadable doesn't mean I'm going to buy it.
I mean, it's crap, so I'll wait.
Misty in our chatroom says, aren't most game sites tools of Satan?
Yeah, that's true.
And actually, that gives me a chance to work in a plug for allgames.com, where our show is rebroadcast every week, Monday nights at 5.30, and, well, unless they run long, which they usually do, and Pacific Time and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
Allgames.com actually endorsed by Satan himself, actually.
So check it out.
Hot.
Yeah, that's hot, really.
Literally, whoa, yeah.
Alright.
Do you care about Warhawk and All Rise Princess?
I don't even know what the hell that is.
They had it on PlayStation 1.
It's like a biplane, like old shooting type game.
I mean, you're into bi.
It was done by the same people that did Twisted Metal.
And it was one of those kind of air combat games, but
It was one of the big things that they were showing off the 6-axis controller at E3, and I remember laughing my ass off when I saw the guy demoing it, and he barely landed this thing on the little landing pad, because the thing was practically falling off of the landing pad, because he just sucked balls at actually using this.
So that was kind of funny.
I would have loved to see him land it and the whole thing tip over and fall into the water, but alas...
Some other PlayStation 3 news for you guys.
If you guys have been kind of QQing over the fact that there's not a lot of, and I don't mean lining up, a lot of PlayStation 3 exclusives coming out.
What's interesting is that they are going to be getting some exclusives for Spider-Man 3, which I believe is a Sony picture movie, if I'm not mistaken.
And what's interesting about it is that Activision will be putting out a PlayStation 3 exclusive version of Spider-Man 3, but it's just the collector's edition that's exclusive.
The game itself will still be out on other platforms, but with the collector's edition exclusive to the PlayStation 3, you get some webisodes...
Special Spider-Man 3 trailers as well.
As well as you get to play as the second Green Goblin in the game.
There's going to be some missions.
Thank you for ruining the next part of the story.
Well, I thought you were done.
No, I was not done.
You paused.
You were a long pauser.
It's fine.
But I will say this.
It also interfaces with the 6-axis controller.
What, you don't care about Spider-Man 3, Eddie?
No, but does the PlayStation 3 version exclusively suck?
I don't know.
It's a little early to judge, but...
No, it's not.
Speaking of fucking over things, PlayStation 3 is going to be $1,000 in Australia.
That's Australian dollars, of course.
But that still equals up to $788 US or â‚¬599.
Yeah, that kind of sucks.
Holy crap, mate.
It's expensive.
Isn't it?
Apparently they say that it's the same price as the European PS3.
It's just because the current exchange rate and the small population size of Australia, they're just going to get fucked over.
Put another PlayStation 3 on the barbie.
You hear those clicks?
Those are all of our Australian listeners unsubscribing right there.
You know what, though?
The thing is, it may be more expensive, but you know what?
They're going to be including...
Casino Royale
Mel B says, PS3, Australian for Ripped Off.
Like the commercials for the beer, get it?
And then Ranma says, Crikes, Australia taking one up the arse.
You have the worst Australian accent.
I have the worst accent, period.
You do.
My Australia sounds like a Scottish guy and my British sounds like an Australian guy.
It all just kind of sounds the same.
It's like your t-shirt dude slash straight guy, whatever.
You just don't try very hard, do you, Rob?
Look, I'm not on this show because I'm funny, okay?
We know that.
I don't know why I'm on this program.
Yeah, we don't know either.
I really don't know.
Oh, I'm on this program to give release dates to you every week from Japan.
And, well, where there's being made fun of of the Australians, heck, why don't we just travel on over to Japan?
Let's make fun of them, too.
And their release dates for the upcoming week.
Coming out, let's see, on March 1st for the PlayStation 3, Gundam Musou.
God, is this the Gundam game we got here?
No, Gundam Musou is even better.
That's Mobile Suit Gundam, isn't it?
It's Mobile Suit Gundam mixed with Dynasty Warriors.
And there's a moose in it, too.
It's Dynasty Gundam, where you're fighting hundreds and hundreds of AI retarded... That's a pass, thank you.
Robots.
Let's see, what's coming out over on the Nintendo Wii?
Densha Dego Shinkansen EX Aku Daikan 3
I like this because this is the best cover I think I've ever seen.
Is it like you have these real people and there's this guy on the cover that's making this face like, Huh?
What do you want?
He's like, I farted.
You looking at me, bitch?
I don't know what the hell type of game this is.
It's a strategy game.
I'm going to post the link there in chatroom for those who want to see the cover of that game.
That's one of my favorite covers I've seen in a long time.
Let's see.
What else do we have coming out over in Japan?
on the Nintendo DS.
A handful of games coming out.
Super Robot Taisen W is coming out.
And let's see.
Ooh, Disney Meteos is almost out.
That's March 5th.
Disney Meteos?
Oh, that's the U.S.
Like Meteos?
Never mind.
March 5th in the U.S., sorry.
Coming soon.
Let's see if there's any other release dates.
That's all I got.
Not a big week for releases in Japan.
Darn.
I'm also doing Euro release dates tonight, though, because DarkSakura's not here.
So let me quickly get...
Let me geek them out getting out some release dates.
Let's see.
The Elder Scrolls on the PSP is slated for March 1st.
Also slated for March 1st, Legend of Zelda The Phantom Hourglass.
That doesn't sound right.
I thought that game got hella delayed.
You got hella delayed.
That's interesting.
What the hell?
These don't even sound like legitimate release dates.
They're talking about Resident Evil 5 on the Xbox 360?
What?
No.
I think there's just some placeholders on this calendar here.
I would believe this though, Yu-Gi-Oh!
GX coming out on the second for the PSP.
That certainly seems legit.
Still no one cares.
Sonic and the Secret Rings for the Wii also on the second.
There you have it.
Awesome.
Wait, speaking of Resident Evil, is that on your agenda tonight?
I don't think so.
The Resident Evil 3 trailer came out for the movie?
No, it definitely was not on the agenda tonight.
Oh, well, the trailer's out.
And?
So go watch it.
It's called Resident Evil Extinction.
It actually doesn't show a lot.
Actdeft says Resident Evil 3 was filmed in my city.
Do you live in Raccoon City?
Are there a lot of raccoons?
Okay, yeah, so that's it.
That's all I wanted to say.
Let's get some definite for sure release dates, Loki.
Nothing's ever definite for sure.
I shouldn't try and fill in for Jamie.
I just shouldn't.
Let's see, some exclusive stuff real quick, and this isn't all that great.
I mean, it's already been announced, Command & Conquer 3 for the 360.
It is coming out now, though, May 9th, so that's kind of cool.
Definitely need some more real-time strategy stuff.
This one's kind of interesting, but not too exciting.
Backyard Football 08, and this is one of those franchises, it's the only kid franchise for sports games, and it is coming to the Wii and PlayStation 2.
So, but that's all the way in September 27th.
But, you know, definitely a budget Atari title that they keep putting out each year.
Ryoma says Backyard Football is the best ever.
Okay, well, there you go.
The best ever.
I'll stick with that.
Anyways, this week, though, we've got some good stuff coming out.
On the 360, we have Bullet Witch, which is going to be pretty awesome.
And, you know, if you're definitely looking for some scantily clad witches fighting demons...
Oh, perfect.
And I do believe that there is a download where you can get a schoolgirl outfit for her, so that's awesome.
Also on the 360, Dance Dance Revolution Universe finally making its way out, and I'm picking this up.
I can't wait to try it out.
Of course, I'm not going to be able to use a dance pad, but, you know, upstairs apartment and all.
Samurai Warriors 2 Empires.
I'm buying it anyway.
Listeners can deal.
If I have to hear them practicing guitar or piano or whatever the hell they have down there, they're going to hear me playing DDR.
Samurai Warriors 2 Empires
Um, 07, the show's also coming out on PlayStation 2.
On the Wii, we've got SSX Blur, which, you know, SSX is an awesome snowboarding game, so definitely check that out.
PlayStation 3, you've got Formula 1 Championship Edition.
If you're a racing fan, you might like that.
On the PSP, Chili Con Carnage, uh, which is, I believe, Total Overdose on the PSP now.
And, uh, 300 March to Glory, uh, PSP game based on the upcoming Frank Miller movie and comic.
Um,
Finally, also on the PC, we've got Jade Empire Special Edition, which looks pretty cool.
Also, Sims 2 Seasons, expansion pack for Sims 2.
And I do believe that is it.
Oh, I think Luminous Plus might be coming.
No, I think that already came out.
Can't remember.
That's moved around so many times.
I think it did, because DMM mentioned it when he called in earlier.
Yeah, but I think stores got it early, so they might have broken street on it.
I'm almost positive.
I saw it at a GameStop like two months ago.
But as much as I love Luminous, I'm not buying it again.
I have it on PSP twice.
I have it on 360.
I don't need it again.
Really, I don't.
It's a good game.
It's good, but it's not, you know, freaking buy it four times good.
Then, of course, you know, on Virtual Console, though, you've got, you know, what is it, Ocarina of Time coming out?
So, you know, if you want to purchase a game...
Virtually, you can go ahead and do that.
Yeah, because I don't already have the GameCube disc and the version.
How many times have they released that game?
Too many.
All right.
Anyhow, speaking of buying things, one of the places very popular for folks to buy games at is Circuit City.
Well, what's interesting about this is that Circuit City is testing a new program online and at select stores today.
They are now dabbling in used game sales.
So it looks like they want to start competing with places like GameStop.
Of course, this means games are usually selling about $5 cheaper than they usually do.
The prices, it appears, according to reports, are about the same that you would see at a GameStop.
But of course, Circuit City wants a piece of that.
A billion dollar market, apparently, that GameStop EB Games has.
I think a little competition for GameStop would be a healthy thing.
So I totally support this.
Although I have to admit, I don't usually shop at Circuit City.
But maybe that's part of it.
Another reason they want to do this is maybe they'd like to get their foot in the door a little more with games.
So I welcome the price competition.
I don't think GameStop could buy Circuit City very easily like they did EB Games and whatever else they've been buying lately.
So I think this will be a good thing.
Yeah, it is a good thing as long as they don't kind of go along the same lines of their ads and coupons policy, which means that, well, for example, there was a situation that happened.
Last month, Circuit City had a flyer that ran an ad which promised to save you up to $40 when you buy your Wii with them.
It says, as long as you visited the website, printed the flyer, went to the shop, they give you the discount.
Later on, though, they said they'd take it all back.
They said the discount actually comes with a statement, qualifying purchases excluding gaming hardware, and took the coupon off the site completely.
But apparently people went to the store and...
wanted the discount and they couldn't get it.
And then of course they complained to the Better Business Bureau and so on and so forth.
And the response was apparently the Better Business Bureau received a ton of responses for it.
One of the things they basically got from Circuit City was that they reserved the right to make changes to advertisements and coupons, etc.
at
Whatever they want.
So, you know, where they can print out, you can have a coupon for, you know, $40 off of a system or something.
They can go ahead and bait and switch.
Huge comments from chat room on these two topics.
Joshi16 says, Circuit City will give up, me thinks.
ShadowCharlie says, Circuit City, they can go fuck themselves.
DDRDollarBill says, Circuit City will fall soon.
Blaze says, competition for GameStop is important because there's little competition out there.
James Patrick says, GameStop killed EB Games.
I hate them for that.
HitStun says, I'm starting to really miss Funkoland.
And that made a lot of people go, Funkoland!
Funkoland was awesome.
The way you say it's funny, like Funkoland.
Funkland.
Exactly, like it's so funky.
It's got a lot of funk to it.
Funkoland.
All right.
Yeah.
Well, we have some other stuff coming up in this segment, including Beat the Host.
Beat the Host.
And of course we need to find a worthy competitor to play Beat the Host tonight.
So if you want to guess some arcade retro classics here with us, we're going to be asking a question here very soon.
But we have a couple more stories for you first.
And that is this one, which I think is very interesting.
Apparently Digg is trying to trademark its name.
You know Digg.com, D-I-G-G.com, they're trying to trademark their name.
And let me work in a cheap plug, if you would, Orange Lingerieo is on Digg.
And we used to be on the first page, but WC Radio really kicked our butt.
Thanks.
Thanks for that, Speedy.
No, just kidding.
But a lot of shows are kicking our butt there on Digg, including the CorpCasts.
So we need help.
So if you would like to dig our show, head on over to Digg.com, click on Podcasts, search Warren's Lounge, you'll find us.
Give us a dig.
I'm sure somebody will post a link in chat.
We could also use reviews on iTunes.
And I'll tell you what, we actually had two people post reviews last week.
So OLR is the Festering Rash of Internet Radio.
Awesome.
Awesome work.
And then Uni made a more serious review.
Awesome work, people.
I'm so proud of the OL Army.
So we definitely need more DIGs and more reviews.
Anyhow, so you know DIG, the social networking site.
Well, get this.
Apparently, LucasArts is trying to interfere with this trademark.
They have actually put in an injunction or whatever, filed an opposition, shall we say, because they had a game in 1995 called The DIG.
And because DIG has a gaming page...
and you have this game called The Dig LucasArts says is too confusing.
But, what?
It's not even spelled the same way or anything.
Like, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
That is terrible.
It's pretty bad.
Apparently it is spelled the same way.
Is it The Dig?
No.
Because this is D-I-G-G and The Dig is just like a dig.
Well, I forgot that The Dig even existed.
Me too.
How could you forget?
It was such a good game.
I don't know.
That's stupid.
Stupid LucasArts.
It's all George Lucas' fault.
Because he makes crappy fixes to his Star Wars movies.
Anyways, so speaking of putting the blame on others.
Wait, I have to say this.
Speedy in chat says, Dig Dug should sue.
That's true.
If the Dig can sue, why can't Dig Dug?
Why doesn't Dig Dug sue the Dig?
Because when you dig stories, don't you say, dug it?
Like it says, hey, you dug it.
Hey man, I dug it.
You know what, Namco, get on that.
I think, um, like, grave robbers and those guys should sue people too.
That's it.
Sorry, that was stupid.
Now I'm really sorry I interrupted Loki.
I know.
Anyways, a Seattle, Washington, um, news station and, unfortunately, you know, they're retarded, but, um,
KOMO TV, they reported on the sexual predators that are on Xbox Live.
And they're blaming Xbox Live for, you know, apparently people.
Remember this whole story with, you know, the kid getting kidnapped and, you know, they apparently had some pictures on live or something like that.
Anyways, they're documenting this 13-year-old boy playing Gears of War, which, okay, that right there is a mature-rated game.
Parents obviously not paying attention to what this kid is doing.
Thank you, by the way, case in point.
I think this makes the whole story a piece of shit, right there.
That they taped a 13-year-old playing Gears of War when it says clearly right there on the label, it's a mature game.
Anyways, though, but it says, a parent is helpless to do anything, and a grown man playing the Lolia character...
for Game Points.
And then that basically went on to talk a little bit about... It's all sensationalism, basically.
But they were also talking about how there's no way that the parents have to be online or with their kids, I guess, or something, in order for the parental blocking to work or something.
Either way, it was one of those stories done by a local station for ratings that obviously had no facts whatsoever.
regarding the subject.
And of course, everybody jumps on it like, you know, creepy.
Hey, baby.
Why don't you come over here and I'll show you the size of my Xbox Live points card.
Oh, yeah.
That was terrible, Rob.
And so is this story.
I know.
Whoa, don't yell at me.
I concur with you.
This has to be... I have to laugh at this.
This is also... They have a picture from...
Fancy Star Universe, which it says right here, it says 500 for pics, 1,000 for nude cam show.
Oh, my God.
Dark Tattooian chat says, want to see my gamer score?
Oh, gosh.
It says people are from Ohio, Kansas, and I'm from Washington.
You can just talk to each other really clear.
I've met other people as far away as Russia.
And then it says the parents are talking about it.
And we're really concerned.
Our problem is parents don't see this as a threat yet.
Of course, they're not paying attention to what their kid's doing.
Anyways, you've got to check out the article.
It's hilarious.
ComoTV.com slash news slash 5983826.html Or just probably just search on the website and you'll find it.
Online Gaming World is a Forum for Sex Predators.
That's the story article.
But it's funny.
Hey Rob, you want to come over and see my huge stiff boner?
Actually, coming from a woman, I kind of would like to see how you're going to pull that off.
Okay, $500 for pics, $1,000 for live webcam action, whatever the fuck it's in.
Okay, here's another one right here.
They're talking about, apparently this kid Adam, I think this is the 13 year old that they're talking about.
His mother, Karen Epstein...
She does not know about the blocking features on Xbox Live.
When she opened Adam's online account, she handed him over the setup so that he can do all the setup stuff for the account.
Okay, well apparently this parent is just stupid because she's handing over this stuff to her kid and letting him get in basically all this trouble and stuff.
And to be honest, I mean, if you're really that concerned about your kid...
And to be honest, I don't think she even knows that there's a threat out there with this stuff until the news person says, Did you know your kid could get raped from Xbox Live?
And then she's like, Whoa, what the fuck?
And related news, according to that one news story we talked about a couple months ago, PictoChat is raping children everywhere.
Did you hear about this?
Ew.
Horrible.
I'm going to start using PictoChat now.
Ross Princess is horny.
Whatever.
You can't rape the willing rice princess.
This is true.
Hey little boys.
No, just kidding.
Wash my brain.
Never be clean.
Here it is, kids.
Tonight's question.
And the first one to send this in a private message to me in the chat room gets to play Beat the Host tonight.
And you have to be willing to use Skype or call our 800 number to be a part of the game.
Now, tonight's topic is classic gaming, right?
So the question is,
If you're a classic gaming expert, this should be no problem for you.
On what board number does Pac-Man crash?
That is, on what board number does Pac-Man crash?
There you go.
I posted it on the chat room, so if you know your classic games, you know what I'm talking about.
So there it is.
All right, meanwhile, controversial stories like our last one always generate a lot of emails, and we always get a lot of good emails to our mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
and through the magic of the space-time continuum, DarkSakura is here tonight to read us our emails.
Hi, Jamie.
Yo, this is the voice from beyond who isn't here because of family business.
Um, here is the, uh, mailbag, and the first email comes from some guy- And thank God I'm here, too, to interrupt you.
Because it just wouldn't be a mailbag segment if I couldn't talk too damn much.
Rob, I hate your Mac.
Hey, bring your own laptop next time.
B-Y-O-L.
Hey, I was gonna give you a free massage, so, fight me.
Massage my butt.
No, I'm not into the glute massage, sorry.
Massage my middle finger.
Right there.
I massaged Christopher's.
Did you?
Yes.
Alright.
Good to be here.
DarkSakura's Obsession with Collection
and Loki's tech news, even when he gets so angry he fumbles his words, lol.
But I don't have the time and patience to sift through the nonsense to get the info I need.
He didn't say he unsubscribed.
I thought I said he unsubscribed.
No, but patience.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yeah, I'm a firm believer in family values, as in I believe in the value of... Never mind.
Sorry, you're getting off topic.
We need to talk more about games.
Is this about a video game?
Is your grandpa a video game?
I don't think he is.
He's not migrant.
All right, you say your piece, I'll say mine.
Okay, anyway.
I think, yeah, to a degree it's gotten a little bit crazy.
But, you know, those are like how the shows used to be back in the day.
And I think it's kind of fun to let loose and be kind of silly once in a while.
Because really...
Ratings state other than what you just said However, I like to keep it a bit more in line Finding the balance is kind of hard Sometimes you do have to let loose and be a little bit silly Everybody needs a change A little break Change is good for you Maybe you need to be silly more often
You're one of those people who, it seems to me, that your energy is rooted in your root chakra, which is the first one.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
All right, look, look.
I want to say my piece.
You know, I agree with what you're saying.
It's about balance, and the trick is that we have to find the right balance on this program between, you know, too crazy and too, you know, too much hardcore games.
Because honestly, you know, there's like 300 video game podcasts out there.
You know, granted, just because we were one of the first ones out there doesn't mean that, you know, people will automatically, you know, tune into us because we were one of the first.
We have to compete with 300 podcasts, everything from other independent podcasts to corporate podcasts.
Although I don't see the other independent podcasts really as competitions.
I actually want to say thank you to the emailer in a strange way because the other podcast he says he's going to go listen to instead are at least both independent podcasts that are just fine shows.
But there wasn't an instead there.
Well, whatever.
Anyway.
So regardless, but it's interesting because â€“
For me, I know I've listened to one of those shows before, and they kind of have an off-topic-ness of their own.
That's not a bad thing.
I think you have to have a personal touch.
That's what makes all these shows unique.
So, you know, we're still trying to find the balance in a way.
Yeah, I was a little crazy the past couple weeks, but, you know, it was fun.
I think what makes me happy about this one, though, is that he cared enough to tell us.
That's true.
And, I mean, that to me just seems like is, you know, hey, I want you guys to do better, you know.
So, I mean, if that's the case, that's sort of the vibe I was getting.
So, I hope that's the case.
Dude, I hope you're still listening.
I'm sorry for picking on you.
I pick on everybody out of love.
But, you know, honestly, that helps us do better.
So, if you stick with us, keep giving us that chance, you know, you'll...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'll be eating cake.
Well, have fun.
Bring me back some cake.
Is it ice cream cake?
I don't know.
It's for Grandfather.
Cake the video game?
Cake the band?
So, next email.
Yes, next email.
From AZHP.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
I'm not a dude.
PS3 Price Drop
Now, do you guys think this is a wise decision?
Would they make more money by keeping the same price but having a cheaper cost of production?
Or would they benefit from having a larger install base with a price cut to get more software sales?
It just feels like Sony of America doesn't even know what Sony Japan is doing or thinking.
They're all just winging it.
I love the PS2, even though I'm on my third one because they keep breaking.
But they just keep doing the wrong thing at the wrong time with the PS3 and PSP.
What's going on?
You know...
I would rather pay more for a quality product.
That's my thought.
That's actually sort of why I like my first generation Japanese PS2.
Because even though they had parts that wore out a little bit faster, they were a little bit better made in terms of their sturdiness.
It's business.
They're always wanting to make things cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and not change the price.
They want to make it transparent to the buyer.
You're not going to know the difference.

So, you know, granted, Sony doesn't want to keep taking such a big hit, so they do want to cut corners.
But again, it's about a balance.
If they can maybe save $100 on a system, pass along $50 of that savings to me, at least it'll be the illusion of, hey, the price is falling, even though they're going to actually gain a little more money, if that makes sense.
Well, and I hate to keep comparing things to my massage therapy, but it's actually a lot of what they talk about in the business aspect of that is that when you're trying to get clients in, and in this case comparing it would be new buyers, you make like an introductory price.
You make like a special, you know, get your PS3 at the sale date, you know, maybe like a corporate sponsored sale.
They get a bajillion buyers, you know what I mean.
They get more people purchasing it.
and then have it be at the regular price.
They can say, oh, well, this is a good product.
It's really worthwhile for you to buy it.
And then other people will come back.
And that's, you know, I think, how you do it.
All right.
I hope you're listening, Sony.
Sony never listens to us.
Kasarai just needs a massage.
He needs Jamie to touch his chakra.
Not by me.
I'm sorry.
There's people I... Give him a happy ending.
Rob.
Heart.
Okay, this one comes from Twist.
Twist.
I think Twist is a new writer, too.
Hi, Twist.
I think that you're awesome.
Anyway, hey, OLR.
A few things I want to write about today.
First off, I was at GameStop today.
I'm so sorry.
And there were two Sony men there.
Sony, big capital letters.
I guess they were just checking on their PS3 demo setup or something.
The assistant manager there, a friend of mine, was talking to one of them and asked when the US will see any white PSPs.
The man explained it probably wouldn't happen.
They watched Nintendo sell their multicolored systems and learned a little from it.
Owning every colored system seems to be a trend in Japan and not America.
Also, if a white PSP were to be released and someone who wanted a white PSP went to a store to buy one and they only had black ones available, they would leave the store and not buy any PSP.
They would therefore be losing out on a PSP sale.
Those were the excuses he gave.
And instantly the sex stopped.
She later explained...
She used to hate video games.
She would get mad at her little brother all the time when they were younger and her father would chase him off the TV when he would be playing.
So why the sudden interest, I asked.
She figured out that she hated them maybe because her brother never let her play and no one ever taught her.
So I thought maybe every girl is a potential gamer but can't express it because of game-hugging brothers.
I don't know, I used to just kick my brothers off and play myself.
Last thing, Evolution Fighting Game Tournament, evo2k.com.
You guys should check it out.
It's a great experience.
People here take fighting games to a whole other level.
You guys have the Bimani community.
I have the fighting game community, lol.
That's all.
Love the show.
Keep it up.
No matter how off-topic the show goes, it's always great.
You know, the fighting game community, they're some pretty hardcore people.
You know, I don't follow that scene a whole lot because I suck at fighting games.
But, yeah, it's pretty hardcore there.
I like Smash Brothers, though, but I suck at it.
There's just a funny story.
There's a guy who's well known in the cosplay community now named Chris, Chris Tang.
A long time ago when we first met him, he worked for Capcom and brought his own joystick over to our house and proceeded to be on like a level five difficulty while Dan was at like a one difficulty.
And Dan actually beat him around and he said that that was the most fun he's ever had playing because someone actually managed to beat him.
So losing once in a while isn't so bad.
If you beat everybody that's around you, then... That's why I kind of... You know, I love fighting games, but there are people who get way too into it, who get too good for the game to be enjoyable, I think.
Have I told my Street Fighter II chick story on this air once?
One time I was in L.A., and I was on, like, a trip, and it was when I was younger, probably about 17, and we were at a comic book shop late one night.
It was, like, after closing, but for some reason a bunch of people were still there.
There were all these hardcore Street Fighter II people playing,
And I walked in, I didn't know much about the game, and I was playing Chun-Li, and I kicked all their asses.
I did.
But the thing is, is that I probably beat like eight of them in a row, and they were getting pissed, like, who is this guy, what the hell is he doing?
You know, it was probably because I was doing some new, I was some new blood, and they all knew each other's techniques, probably.
So they kicked my ass.
Well, finally, you know when I went down?
When some girl walked in, and she also picked Chun-Li, she schooled me.
So...
Julia, who on Tekken... Julia and Jin both have...
Moves that block throws.
And so I was just using them over and over again and managed to piss them off so badly that they left all of their credits in the machine and left.
And I, of course, took advantage of it.
I'm not going to let any credits go to waste.
Very nice.
I love being a girl gamer.
I think we completely got off topic of that email, but oh well.
That's what happens when you email us.
This one comes from Radink.
I guess that's how it's pronounced.
Hey OLR, love the show.
I was curious as to what the closing song of the show was.
It is iFuturelist by Kiri Yamaoka.
Oh my god.
Fame producer of the Silent Hill series.
Uber email.
Okay, this is from McFloyd.
This is a great email.
Dear OLR Crew, I haven't emailed in a while, so I thought it was about time I did.
Speaking of emailing, whatever happened to the letter of the week?
Did it just phase out because I haven't heard one being announced for a while?
The only reason I think about it is because my first email was the letter of the week, and I was ecstatic about it, and I haven't heard much since then.
You know what?
It's been... Okay, I know this is hardly an excuse, but I have been horrendously busy.
Well, also, just we haven't gotten a lot of Uber emails lately.
Yours is it.
Congratulations.
You're a second-time winner.
We don't get a lot of Uber emails.
I think the idea behind the Letter of the Week was for the Uber emails that were just too long to read on air, we would have them just be the Letter of the Week and everybody could go read them on their own time.
But we haven't gotten a lot of those lately.
You know what?
This one's it.
It's the longest email we've received by default you win.
But actually, it's a really good email.
I'm going to finish reading it.
Okay.
and finding more and more that graphics really do affect what I think of a system.
I love my Xbox 360 because it has games like Gears of War and I'm very excited about the effects in Halo 3 from what I've been reading on the Benji website.
Although I don't know if I'll be buying a PS3, it still really impresses me as everything looks so realistic.
If Sony made some better decisions and the price went down a bit, I might even consider getting the PS3, mainly because it has the processing power to make major games perform well and possibly to make the dashboard, or whatever it's called on the PS3, very sleek, easy to navigate, and a simple place to put music, pictures, movies, etc.
In a few years, I would see the PS3 and Xbox 360 as good game consoles, but I'm worried about the Wii.
It doesn't have the power to play games that will make people gasp in admiration, or the space right off the bat to store large amounts of information.
It has the graphics of a game generation that was supposed to last five years, and it's supposed to last for a generation that could be even longer.
The controller is innovative, there's no doubt, but games like Katamari Damacy pulled off innovation with regular PS2 controller and peripherals can always be made.
Software like the Wii channels can very easily be copied by Sony or Microsoft.
So why haven't they done it?
I think, again, it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
And on the Wii, you have Wii Sports, Zelda Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, and on the PlayStation 3, you have Mobile Suit Gundam, Sonic the Hedgehog.
Granted, you have Resistance, but Resistance...
Is Resistance $600 plus $60?
No, okay, let me give PS3 benefits out.
$500 plus $60 plus, you know, whatever the component cable costs to make the game look good.
Is it worth that?
Is it that good?
I say no.
For the average gamer, no.
But whereas the Wii, you know, again, the Wii is going towards a different audience than you, the hardcore gamer.
They're accomplishing their goal very beautifully, I think.
Honestly, I know a lot of people.
I mean, look, we have Marissa in here last week.
We've had, you know, I've had other people I know that don't really play a lot of games or haven't played a lot since 8-Bit Nintendo.
Grandparents are playing the Wii.
Yeah, you know, just even outside the grandparents, because I think a lot of the, like, you know, anti-Nintendo crowd says, like, oh,
Well, a grandma may play Wii bowling, but does that mean she goes out and buys a Wii?
I don't know, but that means that grandma's going to think about that for her kids.
Actually, I was at Target a couple of days ago and saw this lady probably in her early 60s buying a Wii, and we were in line together.
So I asked her, I was like, so this is for your grandkids?
She's like, no, it's for me.
You know, I don't want to come off sounding like a Nintendo fanboy.
To be fair...
Sony, you know, has the potential.
You're right.
This guy's right.
The system's got a lot of processing power.
It's got a lot of potential.
But at the same time, so does the Wii.
We know Nintendo always keeps secrets about systems.
They don't show off till later.
The Wii really, truly has not gone online yet.
I think they will, despite the whole friend code thing.
I just have this feeling that, you know, once you really sit down and play Animal Crossing with Wii Connect 24, it's going to be a different type of experience all its own.
But in the meantime, I still think Microsoft will always be the king of gaming, online gaming in this case.
But I don't know.
We'll see.
We'll see.
It's just too early.
I mean...
Wake me up when Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII are out.
Then I can really assess the PlayStation 3.
But right now, it's a pretty box with nothing inside it.
That's how I feel.
Actually, mine's dusty now.
I mean, if I were to show... It's a shiny, dusty collector.
If I were to show my mom Resistance, she might go, well, it's nice looking.
But if I were to show my mom Wii Sports, she'd go...
and so on.
There's one other issue that's been bothering me.
The way people rate games.
I find it disturbing, and this doesn't just relate to video games, that sex is as much a bigger deal than violence for the ratings as it's a much worse thing.
For those who really understand what violence does, I suppose it's okay that violence is so prominent in video games, but when little kids grew up seeing in movies and games that violence is not such a big deal and sex is awkward or wrong, or when people do it, they're somehow breaking the rules, it definitely sets them on the wrong path for looking at life.
I think that as long as games and shows are separated from reality, it's okay.
But when kids are becoming saturated with these ideas coming from them from all directions, it's hard for parents to give them the right information when the media controls their kids' minds.
My point with all this is that you have to give the parents a break because entertainment, video games included, is affecting children, and there will always be friends with systems to play or TVs to watch.
Even parents try their hardest to stop it.
That would require an impossible amount of patience and strength.
Yeah, I can see it from that angle.
I do understand that.
But I think that it's just a matter of... Actually, you phrased it beautifully.
Parents don't often have the courage to teach their children about life early on.
I think that if they started off educating their children, that would avoid a lot of the problems.
Make sure that if their child's going to see something that
It's not a big deal to her.
It's just like
www.DarkSakura.com
because their logic â€“ they're not fully developed.
Their logic is not all there.
If you say, hey, this happens, this is what goes on, they're going to be in a better position to assimilate what they're seeing.
It's very interesting you bring up that point because I kind of â€“ one other little thing.
I don't know if I was maybe mishearing or misreading into this letter, but I'm also hearing that this is â€“
The society and the parents have a way bigger problem with sex and games than they do with violence and games.
And that's just American culture in general.
I mean, you're not just talking about video games there.
It is movies.
It is TV.
Sex is always looked at way harsher than violence.
I mean, seriously, a movie says the F word twice and it gets rated R. But, you know, you can blow up limbs and heads and, you know, sometimes you can still get away with a PG-13.
Yet we have this real problem with underage sex in this country.
Interesting, hmm?
I don't know, you kind of apply what you're saying there, and when it's taboo, people want to do it.
I bet if mom and dad talked more about them having sex in front of the kids, kids would never want to have sex, ever.
I'm joking, I'm not a parent, I don't know.
Just something that, more information that I've taken from my classes, one of my teachers said that, um,
DarkSakura.com
Adrenaline into your liver, which is shortening your lifespan in general.
You're not breathing properly.
But also, you know, there's this whole attitude that sex is something that you don't discuss.
It's something that you keep hidden, where it's offensive.
I'm willing to discuss sex on this program anytime.
Well, and you know, and there's some people who are, who don't need it so much.
You know, I'm not gonna.
There's some people I know that do need it, because, you know, oh boy.
It really, but it is, I think, you know, it is, I think, an important part of your overall well-being.
It's a balance that it creates.
And when we treat it like it's a disease, when we treat it like it's something that's disgusting, that's foul and immoral, you really take something that's very healthy for you and treat it, it's like having the cure for cancer.
and thinking that it's, and treating it illegal.
All the emails have this balance theme going on tonight.
I fully believe in balance.
I think it's a good thing.
But, you know, it's just that whole, that's, you know, I hate to go off on the tangent like that, but that's my view toward how America views sex.
Because if you go to a lot of other countries where people just, you know, go around topless or, you know, where nudity is on TV and no one treats it like a big deal, look at their rate of sex crimes, you know.
I'm going to start a trend right here.
I'm going to go around topless in studio right now.
You know what, Rob?
I can't.
But it's, you know, if you take a look at it, we have such a high rate of sex crime because I think it's because we do treat it like it's a disease.
Well, your thoughts are always welcomed out there.
I'm sorry for going off on it.
But, you know, it's...
It's actually something that's been sort of sitting on my head for a while because I really noticed it, you know, and video games are just another symptom of it, you know, the whole hot coffee thing is like, dude, why?
It's got an M rating anyway, didn't it?
I believe so.
Yeah, so.
But they said it should have been AO, but that's R versus NC-17.
But anyway.
Whatever.
So the last phrase here.
And by the way, Loki got pwned.
He was so confident about the Halo 3 release in spring, yet on the Bungie website, a picture had the ad campaign came out.
And at the bottom, Fall 2007 was written boldly and clearly.
I guess no one's perfect, but he was still wrong.
Okay, that's all.
Bye.
Listen to last week, part A. I called him on it.
P.S.
He has some good reasoning, though, so take a listen.
P.S.
Since the Wii is 7th generation and the Xbox 360 is 2nd generation for Microsoft, the term for Wii and 360 owner should actually be Wii 69.
I'm not sure how that math came about, but all right.
Okay.
We'll take it.
We have one from Lee.
Hi, Lee.
Who is apparently writing us from London.
Well, hello.
Hiya, guys.
Would you like to sit down and have some tea and crumpets?
I got an email complimenting me on the British accent, by the way, to my personal email box.
Really?
Yes.
I haven't done mine on here, have I?
I don't know.
We're running long.
One thing I really like about being from Alabama, if you look up, the southern accent is actually derived from... Balance, Jamie, balance.
Hey, I'm going to talk about it.
The southern accent is actually derived from the West England type region of accent.
Did you read that on Wikipedia?
Yeah.
No, I didn't.
I actually took a linguistics class.
But you can find it on Wikipedia, though.
Anyway, back to the email.
Hiya, guys.
Just wanted to comment on your marketing strategy.
Rob suggested at the end of your last show that all listeners go out and let one person know about OLR.
I think this may be an unnecessarily slow process and hamper your efforts at world media domination.
If my math is correct, and it most likely isn't,
Lee, Lee, Lee
Lee is the new marketing manager of Orange Lounge Radio.
I like the way you think, Lee.
Welcome aboard, Lee.
Welcome aboard.
Send me a plane ticket, please.
I like the way this man thinks.
Therefore, at the end of the show, from now on, I will be encouraging everyone to tell two people.
Now they have to tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio, and you can all thank Lee for that.
I like the way he thinks.
That was brilliant.
Last email, which is going to segment...
Play my music, Rob!
Good morning!
One of my friends, another listener, linked me to this site a few days ago, and I thought it was cute.
Perhaps it could be a website of the week or something of the sort.
It at least deserves an honorable mention.
Objection!
Which we have discussed on the site before.
I have seen previous user-made objections, so this is good.
It's about time we named this the site of the week.
However, yeah, you're right, it's about time.
So it's objection.mrdictionary.net.php
And we actually have one submitted in this email.
So you actually had an objection put in the email?
Yep, and it's loading the text right now.
Clearly, DarkSakura should choose objection as the website of the week.
Evidence shows that it is 99% amazing.
I'd like to know what type of evidence that is, but all right.
We'll take it.
That sounds like one of my live demo entries too.
Anyway, that'll do it for both the website of the week and for emails.
Keep them coming, y'all.
All right.
Any closing words you want to say to the listeners at home, DarkSakura, before we vanish you into what's current and live on the show right now?
I didn't say what I was playing this week.
All right.
Well, quickly tell us about your gaming week.
I played World of Warcraft.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Thanks to my dear best friend, Chris.
I am playing again.
I don't have Burning Crusade yet because, well, I have to pay $300 at the end of March and $500 to buy a massage table in April, so I'm kind of broke.
However, I played my first human.
I played a warlock, and I hate kobolds.
What server are you on?
Raven... Ravencrest?
Oh, the server we all play.
Wait a minute.
I was trying to say Ravenloft.
Wait, Ravencrest, but you're a human.
Yes.
What's your character's name?
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and Misty has sent us 20,000 emails from her phone.
So you can email like Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio on your phone?
I can do that too.
Interesting.
But I like this one.
Hey, I miss you guys a lot.
I'm just going to go ahead and get a brand new computer once my tax money gets here.
Misty's funny.
She sends me a lot of random AOL messages too, but it's cool.
They make me chuckle.
Dude, it's the doctor!
On that note, we better go back to the present time.
So quickly, your final thought.
Anybody in the Sacramento, Roseville, Citrus Heights area, in April I will be a licensed massage therapist and my rates are $75 an hour for me to come to your house and give you the best massage ever.
Is this the Orange San Diego video game show or the massage show?
Because I'm starting to wonder.
Will you massage people while they play video games?
Maybe.
Maybe.
DarkSakura.com
Did you hear about this, Eddie?
I don't know.
Did you see the list that GamesRadar posted of the five game characters with one foot in the closet?
I did not, but I'd love to hear it.
You might want to turn on that mic.
I did not, but I'd love to hear it.
Well, I don't know if I want to really read the whole list, but basically it was a bit of a controversial article.
They said Kratos from God of War, Marcus Fenix from Gears of War, Frank West from Dead Rising, and Vaan from Final Fantasy XII.
That's true.
But you know what's interesting?
What's interesting is kind of the way they went about saying it is they used a lot of gay stereotypes.
You know, like, so-and-so is, you know, cross-dresses, so he must be gay, because he looks like a chick, so he must be gay.
That's stupid.
That's pretty dumb.
And what's interesting is it caught the radar of Gay.com, which is not a gaming site, it's a gay site.
It caught the radar of Gay.com's UK edition, as well as another site, PinkNews.com.
and they publicly yelled at these GamesRadar article.
Pink News said, quote, What is the point of outing characters?
Is this yet another bunch of childish straight boys laughing at gay people?
And the author of the gay.com article was elaborating that the article had a very facetious tone to it and basically was making jokes about the LGBT community.
And I guess because they pegged Frank West as being gay because he dresses up in women's clothes and children's clothes.
Yeah, I mean, gamer guys are... Not the ones that listen to this show!
Yeah, I can see that, where they'd be kind of homophobic.
They make hot guys, too.
Have you never played any of the Castlevania games?
Where the hell have you been?
What is that one game that came out?
God Hand?
That game is pretty ripping on gay people.
I haven't seen this game.
God Hand is for PS2.
The game looks pretty good, but it's pretty over-the-top porn for 14-year-old straight guys.
You can spank, but only the female characters.
There's these really flaming gay villains.
The whole game is supposed to be a parody on Kung Fu games or whatever.
It's like Kung Fu Hustle the game.
That's basically what it's supposed to be.
Yeah, but in every trailer they show the spank attack.
But you could only spank the female villains.
They didn't program it, so you could just spank anyone.
So I don't know, that's pretty one-sided to me.
Interesting.
I don't know, I read the original list that GamesRadar posted.
I just thought it was stupid.
Okay, dude.
Right.
Sure, dude.
Dude.
Yeah, sure, dude.
The guy from Gears of War is totally gay.
Yeah, you got it.
What?
Yeah, because he's thinking about his buddies too much and all that.
And Kratos is totally gay because he doesn't bang two chicks at the same time in two different games.
Uh-huh.
And he doesn't wipe his ass with tree bark.
I mean...
Where was Makoto on the list?
That's the reason I didn't take the list.
I guess maybe because it was about closeted game characters, whereas Makoto in Enchanted Arms was a... Where is the king of the cosmos?
Or Seymour.
Or where is King, the biggest lesbian in all of video games?
Oh my god, she's totally a lesbian.
Yeah, I'm kind of with you though, Skye.
I don't really care.
Yeah, I don't really care.
I mean, whoa, you know, it's like, I just, you know, I want there to be a game where you spank guys.
You like Sims-type games where you can just do whatever you want.
Yeah, pretty much.
Yeah, as long as they let me do stuff to guys in the games.
You're gay.
Only willing ones, of course.
Yeah, well, yeah, no, yeah, of course.
I mean, geez.
Come on now.
Uh-huh.
Come on.
Gays are gay.
Uh, let's see.
James Patrick says, God Hand, the main character is gay, right?
Or becomes gay.
That's what the X-Play video seemed to suggest.
Yeah.
Of course, that's
A lot of things, a lot of X-Play videos suggest gay themes for games and... Yeah, that's, that's kind of what this article struck me as.
It was like an X-Play review.
Like, it's trying, like, way too hard to be funny, but I just don't laugh.
That's what it is.
Yep.
Alright.
So that's it.
I don't have my feathers ruffled over it.
I just kind of go, GamesRadar's wearing enough egg on their face over it.
I don't need to be all senior.
Oh, it's homophobic and blah blah blah.
No, it wasn't.
It was just stupid.
There's a difference.
There's a difference between homophobia and stupidity.
Nobody really cares about you guys.
So every month it seems to be that there's a story out there about somebody killing somebody and somehow they're tying it into violent video games.
And that was the case also with a Milwaukee murder.
15-year-old Nathan Moore was a murderer of Rex Baum, an alcoholic transient.
And apparently Nathan Moore was quoted saying it was just like a violent video game.
Killing the guy reminded him of a violent video game.
So of course everyone went, ah, it's games to blame and stuff like that.
Well, the stepmom of Nathan actually was a dedicated Penny Arcade reader, and she actually wrote him a letter regarding the whole thing.
And it's actually quite interesting because they talk about how the kid is just kind of just crazy, getting in trouble in every which way, and
No, it doesn't... She basically points out it's not the game... Not video game's fault, and it did not make him who he was.
He was already fucked up to begin with, so... I do think it's kind of interesting that at least there's someone out there that's willing to say, Hey, this is not the case.
And I believe someone pointed out... I can't remember where it was, but they pointed out that, you know...
He may be crazy, but he's not stupid.
He knows that he can get some sort of crazy insanity plea with saying that, oh, video games made me do it type of thing.
So I think he's just trying to use that to get off a little bit.
I don't know.
To get off?
Ew.
To get off from being you.
I love we can always count on the serious perspective from Rice Princess.
Do you have any serious thoughts on this?
Yeah.
That was it.
I farted.
Everybody say goodbye to Rice Princess, folks.
She won't be back last week.
Shut your face.
Anybody have any comments on that?
I do.
Moving right along then.
You guys are assholes.
Microsoft has been caught in a lawsuit and a federal jury ordered Microsoft to pay $1.5 billion dollars
to the telecom group Alcatel Lucent for violating two patents related to digital music.
Basically, it all has to do with MP3 encoding and decoding, and that has to do with Windows Media Player.
You might be going, what the hell does this have to do with gaming?
Well, it's because a part of this suit has to do with speech coding and video coding used in the Xbox 360, which makes you go, hmm, will future Microsoft's products be hampered by this?
Or is this just a case of a jury wanting to get back at Microsoft because they're evil or whatever it is?
I think that they're just going to pay this.
And unlike Sony, they're actually going to pay for the rights or whatever that they may have infringed on and just license them.
I think they do that actually for the Rumble technology.
They license the Rumbling patents or whatever.
Although some companies decide to remove them altogether because they don't want to shell out money.
But whatever.
So, um, you know, on a completely different topic though, um, you gotta love the Russians, and they came up with this wonderful, you know, and this is like such a horrible stereotype, but, um, they've come up with a Russian, a massively multiplayer online drinking game.
Oh my god, that's awesome!
And apparently it's, um,
You would take this special shot glass that would plug into your computer via USB.
And when you logged into a special chat room, the glass keeps track of how much alcohol you have left, just to make sure that you're keeping up.
What if I put water in it?
Ha!
I fooled the computer!
Well, aren't you Elite Hacker?
I hacksword your shot glass.
With water...
Or can't you just, like, pour it out into another cup?
Or, you know, like, there's tons of different ways you could hack into it.
I'll give it all to Irene, because she's poor and can't afford it.
Yeah, I'll take it.
Well, couldn't you just go on one of those adult sites and put up a picture of somebody else?
I mean, that's about the same thing as... Or can't you just, like, drink at home, like, with your friends, and not have to do it on the computer with a bunch of people you don't know?
Like, that's pretty sad.
This sounds, to be honest, this sounds like something that they would have in, like, Second Life.
KaneVM says, in our chatroom again, chat.orangealternative.com, KaneVM says, MMO drinking?
Hell yeah!
Blackboy says, that game sounds awesome.
Blaze says, innocent people will die over this game.
And GS68 says, you'll die of water intoxication.
That's true, I do live in Sacramento.
And apparently people like to do that here.
Oh god.
What?
It's true!
Don't give me the too soon.
Too soon, too soon.
Don't give me that.
Okay, yeah, you know all those people that made those comments were like, under 21, and like, oh my god, it's so cool, a drinking game.
I don't think Black Boy, when Black Boy participates in, I know they call it Free Play Friday, but I call it Drunken Orgy over at All Games on Fridays, so I think he's over 21.
Oh man, they have Drunken Orgies?
We've got to pick up the slack here.
Mississippi Orgies.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, it is the end of February sweeps.
How are we going to top that on the All Games Network?
We're going to murder someone live on air.
I know.
Bye, Rob.
And you wondered why LankyStyle came back.
All right, LankyStyle, just put this plastic bag on your head, and I've got a rubber band.
Too soon, too soon.
I love you.
Hearts to you.
He's really acknowledging me.
I know how we can pull through the sweeps.
Oh man, our ratings are number one.
So anyway, let's go back.
Alright, well no, I know exactly how we can pull through for sweeps.
Are you okay, LankyStyle?
I didn't mean it.
What, an apology to LankyStyle?
Yeah.
He's giving me pouting face.
It's like unsubscribe, unsubscribe right there.
Alright.
Anyway.
Don't misrepresent me.
What?
I said don't misrepresent me.
At least I finally got you to talk.
Fuck.
Alright.
You're mean now, Rob.
I know, I'm a jerk.
Alright.
Alright.
Let's see, I'm looking at chat room.
Blackboy says, did anyone see the photo of me teabagging stalker Oscar?
See, look, we're going to lose sweeps, you guys.
We're going to fucking lose.
Oh, man.
Against this.
Come on, teabagging?
That's it, I'm going to have to go and teabag Rice Princess right now.
Get the hell away from me.
He's really walking towards me.
Bend over.
Ah!
Ah!
No!
How much do I owe you?
All right, anyway, we've got to go to our next segment, which is a great sweeps trick.
It's playing a good old-fashioned game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And we have a game called Beat the Host And we asked a qualifier question earlier in chat And that was, which board does Pac-Man crash on?
And we have our winner on the line Hi, you're on Orange House Radio, you there?
Hey, how's it going?
Hey, who is this?
It's the Rob D Rob D, what board does Pac-Man crash on?
256 That's right, the 256 board is when half of it glitches But apparently, you can actually still get past it But you have to be superhuman
Basically, if you memorize everything, it supposedly is possible, and there is a way to hack the ROM and get around that and make it normal, I think, but I don't know.
That's according to Wikipedia, so I don't know too much about it.
All right, good job.
You and I got the answer from the same place.
All right.
I do have a question to ask you before we get into this.
All right, why not?
Why are you dodging us and hold them?
I was out Saturday night.
I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to dodge you guys.
But Saturday night is a busy night, especially when I work during the week.
I will definitely join you guys, though.
I hear that All Games is expanding to do tournaments throughout the week.
So I will definitely join.
But I will join on a Saturday.
I promise.
But I do Rocky every other Saturday, and that keeps me kind of busy.
All right.
Fair enough.
I just forgot to give you a little grief for that.
All right.
Thank you for the public humiliation in front of thousands.
I mean 20.
No problem.
The Humiliation in front of 20 listeners.
Alright.
Alright, Rob D, you ready to play Beat the Host?
Of course.
Well, then we need some cheesy theme music.
What the fuck is this?
That's right, it's time to play Beat the Host!
No, I'm kidding, I'm not gonna do that.
Alright, the way Beat the Host works is you're gonna choose somebody here in studio to challenge.
You can challenge Casper the Gay, also known as Big Gay Eddie.
You can challenge Big Gay Eddie.
You can challenge Loki...
You can challenge Rice Princess or Lanky Style.
And tonight's topic is classic video games.
We have changed up the rules a little bit, but I'll explain that as we move on.
First off, Rob D., who are you going to challenge?
You know what?
I'll press my luck a little bit.
I'll go with Loki.
Loki!
Loki's being challenging.
Surprise.
Everyone picks Loki.
All right.
He's like the center square.
He's the Whoopi Goldberg of our program.
All right.
10 Classic Arcade Games
What we're going to do is you're going to have two minutes to guess the ten games.
So I will continue to play the music until you correctly guess the song.
This goes for you as well, Loki.
I'll continue to play the music until you correctly guess the song, at which point I'll go to the next song.
However, you can always skip ahead to the next song by just saying, pass.
You want to go to the next song.
So you have two minutes to knock all ten of them out.
Sounds good.
And if you beat Loki, you win a fabulous prize.
Are you on MySpace, Rob D.?
Yes, I am.
All right, then, Rob D., by winning tonight, you'll earn a space in our MySpace Top Friends.
Now, are we supposed to do this like the old one where we just shout out the answers, or do we want to write them down?
No, this time it's not like the way we used to do it where we have to say it all at the end.
You're going to say it while it's going on.
And tonight is a killer.
You're probably going to run through a bunch of games until you get it right.
But if I don't say anything, then you haven't guessed it right yet.
All right.
All right, Loki is now going to leave the studio and head to our isolation booth.
Somebody keep an eye on him and make sure he's not cheating.
Isolation booth.
We have an isolation booth.
Like the old game shows.
So out of curiosity, is the Orange Lounge Radio MySpace friend list easier or harder to get onto than Scott Rubin's friends list on Xbox Live?
It's actually a little harder because I finally got onto Scott Rubin's friends list on Xbox Live.
And I'm almost kicked out of Orange Lounge's top 20.
Anybody want to talk shit about Loki while he's not here?
Alright, Rob D, you ready to start?
You know it.
Alright, then here we go.
Your two minutes begins now.
Pass.
Pass.
I'm going to say Missile Commander, Defender.
Actually, Defender.
Defender.
No, no.
Defender.
Not Defender.
I'm going to say R-Type.
No.
I'll have to skip this one.
Pass.
Um, BurgerTime?
Yes, correct.
One.
Tapper?
No.
One minute left.
No idea.
You gonna pass?
Yeah.
That's Frogger.
Yes, correct.
Pass.
Pass.
30 seconds left.
20 seconds.
I do know this one, but I forget what it is, so I'm going to pass on that.
All right.
15 seconds.
Astro's?
Five, no, four, three, two, one.
Time's up!
Ah, I suck.
That was hard, you didn't even get to the last one.
This is a tough category tonight.
Our chat room's even struggling tonight, but you did get two right, and that may be enough to beat Loki.
So we shall see.
I don't know, my classic arcade game knowledge is a little bit limited on that one, fortunately.
Good luck, Loki.
All right, well, here we go.
We're going to bring Loki back in studio.
If LankyStyle would please go grab Loki.
How is LankyStyle doing?
He actually got a few of them, yeah.
He would have been a very formidable opponent.
All right, well, it's a good thing Rob D didn't pick him.
I'm glad he picked a total loser like Loki.
Hi, Loki, how you doing?
Welcome back.
Loki's wearing the wedding shirt that Jamie and I got him, the one that says Game Over.
Yes.
All right.
All right, well, I can't tell you what Rob D got just yet, but we'll see.
It's a tough category.
Anyway, I need you to look that way.
All right, and you're going to name off.
I don't want them to see what songs are on screen.
So here we go.
Again, just say pass if you want to pass.
You have two minutes, and your two minutes starts right now.
Yes.
Pass.
Pass.
DigDug?
No.
Mr. Dew?
No.
BurgerTime?
Yes.
Pass.
Pass.
Contra?
Nope.
One minute.
Pass.
TikTok.
Yes.
Pass.
45 seconds.
Pass.
30 seconds.
Pass.
We're back to when you passed the first time.
1942.
No.
Minecraft.
No.
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, all done.
All right, let's add it up.
Let's see how you guys did.
Loki, actually I should say Rob D got two right, but Loki got three right.
Loki, you win.
You know, in a lot of them I recognized, I was like, I couldn't place them.
It was really hard tonight.
Charm was doing very well, though.
Rob D, I'm so sorry you didn't win.
That happens.
Good job, Loki.
All right.
Better luck next time, though.
You want to hear the right answers, though?
I bet you want to know them.
Yes, I do.
Oh, damn it.
Are we allowed to guess them?
Or Tempest and Bubble Bobble in there?
Yes, they both were.
What were you thinking, Rice Princess?
Are we allowed to guess them as you go on?
Sure, why not?
Okay, so just play them.
You didn't cheat, though, because the names are up on the screen.
No, I can't even see from here.
Okay, good.
Here we go.
What do you think, Rice Princess?
This is Bubble Bobble.
Loki guessed that one.
What do you think this one is?
Robotron?
No.
Oh.
I have no fucking clue.
Tempest.
That's one.
Oh.
All right.
Somebody got this.
This is Burger Time.
We both got that, actually.
Yeah, I've got no clue.
No idea?
Nope.
Even, I think if I let it go in here a little bit more, it's the... Hold on.
I think it's right here.
You might recognize this.
You remember that?
Crystal Castles!
Crystal Castles.
Oh, yeah.
Alright, this looks stronger.
That's stronger.
This one's a real toughie.
I don't know if anyone got this right.
This is a tough one.
I think somebody in studio said it though.
This could be Zaxxon.
It is Zaxxon.
Oh, damn it!
Zaxxon.
Good job.
This one's one of my favorites.
I'll give you a hint because it involves penguins.
Sega made.
Push cubes around and swoosh little blobs.
Pango.
It's Pango.
Okay, this one is the killer.
I don't know if anyone got this one.
I wasn't watching chat.
Namco made.
In most of their collections of games.
Knights of the Round?
Nope.
Sword Game, incredibly slow-moving character, The Tower of Druaga.
The Tower of Druaga was the last one.
I know, I'm like, what?
I said it was a killer.
All right, there it was, your ten songs, Bubble Bobble, Tempest, Burger Time, Crystal Castles, Frogger, 1943, Dig Dug, Zaxxon, Pengo, Tower of Druaga.
That was killer, but Rob D., you made a good showing, and we appreciate your participation.
All right, thanks for taking my call, and thanks for letting me participate.
And as a consolation prize, a lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni.
All right, sounds great.
All right, have a good one.
San Francisco treat.
I'll see you guys later.
All right, later, buddy.
Rice Princess-a-roni.
Rice Princess-a-roni?
Yeah, sure.
All right, there you go.
All right.
Dark Tetsuya said he would have gotten five, and he knew the Tower of Druaga.
Looks like some folks knew Pingo.
That was very good.
You know, Zaxxon sounded so familiar, and then I just had to think about it for a little bit.
I'm like, ah, crap.
That was a tough one.
And by the way, I pulled all those games off GameTap earlier today because I have a bunch of those games.
And it's really easy for me to dump when the game is on a computer, the audio.
And when I picked Zaxxon at first, I was like, oh, it'll be easy to recognize.
And like I was playing, I was like, this is really hard.
Maybe I should switch it out.
But no, I kept it in there.
But the Tower of Draugr, man, that's killer.
That is freaking killer.
You know what would be cool?
You should do old PC games or something like that because no one would get that stuff.
All right.
Rob D in chat, he's back in chat and yelling...
Coji Kondo
If you know who he is, anyway.
He's the author.
Yeah, he made Legend of Zelda music, Star Fox, Mario.
I mean, the guy's a legend, right?
Well, he is going to be performing at Video Games Live this year in San Francisco.
That's March 9th at 8 p.m.
That's the show during the Game Developers Conference, which I may or may not be going to.
I'm still trying to work out some last-minute details.
I'm hoping to go to...
I really wanna go just to see this.
I think it'll be great.
A lot of the songs they play...
at a Video Games Live.
I don't know if I get, but I think it would be really cool.
You know, like, I did not get into some of the LucasArts games like a lot of people did.
I mean, I do love Loom and Monkey Island, some of that stuff, but apparently they're going to have some LucasArts stuff, and apparently there's going to be a Contra presentation, which should be interesting.
But when I think about Contra, I don't think about the music.
Is it just me?
I don't know.
Some of the last, you know, games were pretty, you know, heavy metal, which would be kind of cool to see perform live.
Oh, yeah, Kira.
That would be awesome.
All right.
Well, I guess we've got one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR.
So, you know, the big story is Itagaki is working on something new, and something that doesn't have to do with boobies, apparently.
Is it day rape?
No, it's not day rape.
But here's the thing, though.
Everyone's like...
Thank you for watching!
Why?
We're back to that again, huh?
Did you say me and Almond Joy here?
Oh, yay.
Oh, sorry.
We're on the air.
I love Almond Joy.
Coconut.
Dude, almonds.
Or as my dad would say, Ammon Joy.
Oh, it's shaped like an egg.
I can shove it up your ass.
You'd probably like that.
You have some almonds?
Some almonds?
That's what my dad says.
You like almonds?
Almonds are crunchy.
You know they have a big almond factory in downtown Sacramento.
Oh, yeah?
Diamond.
Have you ever driven by it?
Oh, yeah.
We're on a video game show.
Well, I guess we should let some callers call in and direct the show otherwise.
1-877-GAME-OLR, there's always our Skype line, username OrangeLoungeRadio.
There's more information on our website, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, by clicking on Interact With Us.
Let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Raven's Dolphin.
Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
Oh, I got time to eat my egg here.
You like Almond Joys?
I love Almond Joys.
I know, it's good stuff.
All right, what's on your mind, buddy?
I like GameTap, especially Abe Lincoln Must Die.
I haven't even played that.
What the hell is that?
That sounds awesome.
That's a new Sam & Max episode.
Oh.
No, I need to play the Sam & Max games.
If you played Sam & Max, you would know, does the carpet match the drapes?
I don't want to know the answer to that.
I seriously need to ban myself from World of Warcraft for a week so I can play some of these computer games I've been missing.
Have you checked out Myst Online?
I haven't gotten into it, but I heard it's great.
I want to.
Are you a fan of Myst, Eddie?
I
I'm a huge fan of Myst.
I love Myst.
It's awesome.
And, yeah, it's cool.
I'm surprised you don't know about Myst online, then.
It just opened up on Valentine's Day.
And he has this, like, Christmas little boy face on right now.
Well, yeah, because I'm, like, probably the only person who still likes point-and-click games, so I'm like, oh, Myst!
Point-and-click.
Alright, Ravenstaff and Will, what else do you have in mind tonight?
Uh, I... Oh, I got a point to pick with Loki.
Alright, Loki.
Raven's Dolphin is going to pick your bones.
Ew.
All right, what's on your mind?
Loki, you said about 15-inch television.
I own a 15-inch television, and I'm not gay, and you said go buy a PC monitor.
I don't have money.
My mom said, here, have this 15-inch HDTV monitor.
Wouldn't you like it for games?
And I said, yes.
When in the hell did he say that 15-inch monitors made you gay?
I don't even remember saying that.
I never said that.
It's interactive.
Oh, when you are on all games on Monday, you must have said it.
I don't even remember saying that.
You know what?
Scott totally sets us up to say mean things so we get angry listeners.
No, I think what I was saying... I think what I was saying... I can't remember...
Oh, I remember now.
Because someone had a 15-inch LCD TV or whatever, and they spent, I forget how much money on it.
And I said, well, you should just go buy a fucking monitor because they're a lot cheaper.
You can get a 19-inch or even a 21-inch or whatever, and you can do HD on a PC monitor.
So just spend the money on that instead.
Yeah.
All right, well, there.
I never said gay, though, ever in that, you know, argument.
I said retarded, but not gay.
I was improv-ing.
All right.
What else?
One more thing.
It's always one more thing.
All right.
It's your trademark, though, you know?
Yeah.
You should have... Do you have a MySpace Raven's Dolphin?
Yes, I do.
Okay, yeah.
You need to get one and put a little picture of yourself on there with little text on it that says, one more thing, and, like, you should have, like, a little picture of you going, like, with a hand.
One.
One.
What's your one more thing?
My headset is orange for Orange Lounge Radio Aww I just threw up in my mouth Alright, thanks Raven Stolfen, you're cool You too, bye Alright, take care, bye Let's go to another phone call What was that?
What the hell did I do there?
I have no idea I'm eagerly anticipating chicken shoot Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.
Hi, Paradox Vincent!
What's on your mind?
Not much.
Not much?
Well, what the hell are you calling us for tonight?
What do you want to talk to us about?
I just think that on the Best Buy story, did that cover their internal...
The whole scandal on their big internal internet is their external internet website.
No, we did not cover that story.
What the hell is this about?
So the Best Buy, their internal is the external site?
What's this about?
Well, basically, I've heard that they'll offer sales on their external website, which you can access from home.
and they'll say, oh, well, there's a sale on this, so I want to go pick it up, you know, pick up this camera that's been discounted down to $130.
But then you go and they won't let you have it.
Yeah, and then they say, oh, that sale ended at 7 plus time and you said, well, I checked the website and they say, oh, the website must have been responding slowly, let's go check this one in store and then they'll go check it and show you, see where it ended at this date
and, um, I just think that's true.
and then you have Walmart and Target both sell things on their website that they don't even sell in the stores the reason why they don't show you that price on there is because sometimes they will have an agreement with the publisher or whoever
DarkSakura.com
And a lot of times Best Buy is retarded, though, because I went in for a camera that was marked down and priced like a couple hundred dollars, and they said they didn't have it, but they were retarded because it was actually last year's model that, you know, it was marked down.
They had it in, like, a shelf.
They had to actually open up, like, a cabinet to get this thing out.
So it might be just retarded for an employee.
I don't even think that they say that it's online only sale.
I really don't think that it is an online only sale.
I just think it's really too shady for anything.
Is it shady?
Yes.
Is it illegal?
No.
So there's really not a lot we can do about it but take our dollars elsewhere.
Yeah, and I'm also really excited about the gold testing in Naperville because I'm really hoping that
means they'll bring it out here and that the arcade in Arizona will get gold because it seriously needs an upgrade from that.
You know, again, I think, again, he's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold.
If you don't know, if you're a new listener to Orange Lounge, you don't know the Bomani music game scene.
He's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold, which is basically the 14th release for Japan, the first one they're testing in the arcades here, although they did put the game out as Beatmania on U.S.
consoles a while ago.
Yeah, you know, I think if the machine does insanely well, which it has the potential to do, I think you're going to have a lot of people driving in to play the machine from nearby areas.
I think you're going to start seeing this.
The only blockade is going to be the machine is still going to be one of the more expensive ones to purchase.
But I think you're going to see arcades around the areas take the plunge.
I'm sure the Golf Land chain, which is big on the West Coast, especially California, Arizona, I'm sure they'll take the plunge.
They usually do at Bomani Games.
I really wish they do.
And I think that's what they might have been working on while they wanted to work on Beat Mini US 2.
I think they might have... Maybe?
Maybe they said, what the hell are we doing two separate games for?
Let's just make it the same.
And I say, it's about time.
Yeah.
I do think it's about time.
Alright.
Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for the call.
Take care, buddy.
And we'll see you next time, alright?
Alright.
Later.
and we'll keep our fingers and toes crossed that they will bring the game to you very soon.
To all of us, because I would like to play 2DX Gold.
I don't know about you.
LankyStyle, you're a big fan of Beatmania 2DX, aren't you?
I used to be.
Did you hear about Beatmania 2DX Gold testing over here in the US?
Nope.
What's that?
The 14th version.
Why did you stop playing Beatmania 2DX?
I've been doing other things.
Like masturbating?
No.
Okay.
Like writing a book?
Yes.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Sorry to call in again, but I do have a couple of comments to make about games.
All right.
Well, Rob D., I suppose, as long as you're going to keep it on topic.
But no talking about Ammonjoys, or I'll have to hang up.
I don't think you have to worry about that from me.
All right.
Okay, so, I don't know.
You guys were talking about the Wii earlier and how it does have problems with...
with games and games coming out, and the lack of games for it, for that matter.
I don't know, I think that all three consoles have trouble with games at this point.
Actually, yeah, they do all have trouble with games in some way, shape, or form.
The 360 has a lack of variety with its games.
If you're an RPG fan, if you're a fighting game fan, if you're a platformer fan, I can't imagine you're too thrilled with the 360's game lineup.
True, and you just said Rice Princess right there, right?
Oh my god, you're my hero, Kirsten.
This is why you have never been a big Microsoft fan, correct?
Pretty much, yeah.
Are you going to change your mind on 360 anytime soon?
No.
Not even Blue Dragon?
Nope.
Sorry, Rob D, keep going.
And then the Wii, obviously.
It just came out, but it does have some trouble with games right now.
I think a lot of third-party developers are unwilling to hop on the bandwagon, or were unwilling to hop on the bandwagon because of the odd nature of the controller.
and now I think by Christmas you'll see a lot more developers willing to give it a shot.
Do you think maybe it's just the time of year?
Like, you know, because this is usually kind of a slow period for games.
We don't see a lot of big games start really hitting until summer.
Like, you know, come May, June, we'll start seeing more games in November.
Whoa, big flood of games.
Do you think maybe that's just part of it, why we feel a little bit robbed right now?
No pun intended.
Probably, but I think that's...
The E3 PowerPoint Expo in May will be very telling.
The PowerPoint Expo?
To see what people announce and see what people have for the Wii, the PS3, and the 360.
I'm hearing that the E3 Elitism Expo is actually supposed to be now possibly all the way to October.
Well, because distribution is in a whole different category, so... Oh yeah, that.
Isn't it funny how no one's excited about E3 now?
Oh, fuck E3.
Who gives a shit?
It's going to be... Well, there went our invite.
Well, it's no longer a rock star show like it used to be.
Oh, yeah.
Well, actually, yeah.
Yeah, it's no longer a big show, and rock star is never there anyways, so we went and see Grand Theft Auto.
Dude.
Well, I meant rock stars and, like, giant sound systems and that sort of thing.
Look, last year when I got diverted walking around the booth because of Paris Hilton, I was pissed.
I was so pissed.
I was like, this show just makes me mad.
Yep.
Although I did have a great time.
I did have a great time.
It was really fun to play all the new games and talk about them, but damn, Paris Hilton.
I mean, man, fuck her.
Anything else, Rob?
I don't know.
I think this Christmas is going to be very interesting.
I think the coming years are going to be very interesting because the console race is really wide open this year.
Well, this generation.
The established leaders problems are well documented.
Sony's got a lot of problems because they're trying to make a they're trying to release a system that's
All-in-One Media Center for $600 when all we want is a game machine.
We ask a lot of people on the program what the PS3 can do to get a bigger foot in the marketplace here and get some of their love back from all us PS2 loyalists, because I'll tell you, I love my PlayStation 2, but I'm not so hot on the PlayStation 3.
I'm going to ask you, what will Sony do, you think?
I think we might see a price drop by this Christmas, honestly.
I don't know how they're going to survive otherwise.
I really don't.
$600?
$500? $500?
It's a lot easier to convince kids' parents or even to convince 20 to 30-year-olds or teenagers with jobs to get the 360, which is going to have a price drop.
You know that by this Christmas.
No question about that.
They're well overdue for one.
Or the Wii, which is $250.
You know what, though?
If worse comes to worse, though, you'll get your lame movie tie-in games that'll sell like crazy.
Wasn't Cars the biggest selling game last year?
or something?
I don't know.
It was some lame movie tie-in game.
It was like the highest selling game last year.
There was, well, Madden.
Madden's always the big one.
And movie tie-in stuff, I don't know.
Cars did okay, but it came out back in June and then the sales had already died by the time it came into Christmas, so.
Zappy says Cars was number three, Madden was number one.
But I'm just saying, although there may not be a lot for us hardcore gamers, the casual gamers and the kiddies, they do have a really big pull in this market we often neglect when we're coming up with all these consensuses.
Yeah, but yeah, it is Sony, so who knows if they'll actually have that price drop.
We'll see.
I hope so, for their sake.
Because otherwise I don't know how they're going to... Well, actually, again, the thing is, we'll see where the Japanese developers go, too.
The ones that make the platformers, the RPGs, the fighting games, because they're not too high on Microsoft.
Well, at least they always have Ridge Racer.
Exactly.
And the Eye of Judgment.
I know what they're going to do, Rob, to save themselves.
Sony's going to include a copy of Rainbow Island with the system.
That's a brilliant idea.
I know.
God, you should go work for Sony.
I shouldn't.
Thank you, Rob, for the call.
All right, thanks for taking me again.
No problem.
I won't play your show anymore.
All right, no problem.
Later.
Bye.
We just kind of hit the answer button on whoever's on deck, but unfortunately we got to call it a night.
We're running kind of long.
We took a bunch of calls in Part A. We've had a lot of people on the show tonight.
Although we do appreciate all you guys calling in.
We're sorry to those digging through.
There were seriously like five people still hammering the line, so I'm so sorry to those of you guys.
We'll try to get you guys next week.
I'm sorry.
Aw, you make me feel bad.
Do you want to do one real quick?
Yeah, sure, even though you just hung up on something.
Real, real, real freaking quick.
Okay, 60 seconds.
Orange House Radio, who's this?
Legend of Zaku.
Alright, Zaku, get it out.
Um, just the fact that it's my understanding that the PS3 is just going to become that sinking ship, the Titanic.
Yes, it is.
I'll never let go, Zaku.
I'll never let go.
Oh, please, yes.
I'm just worried about, you know, honestly, you know, what I'm worried about right now is other games, you know, such as Crackdown, selling other things like, you know, for example, the Halo 3 beta.
I mean, seeing that Crackdown is a really good game, I don't know if, you know, the Halo 3, all that hype might actually, you know, help the series in the long term.
Zaku, with the remaining 15 seconds, how can Sony get out of this mess?
Minus the Final Fantasy XIII and Metal Gear Solid 4.
Minus the two big ones.
Everybody knows about those.
Minus those two.
They need to get more downloadable content, more downloadable games.
Flow and Qbert, I think, are not cutting it right now.
So they need that and just, you know... But what about Warlock?
Oh yeah, that too, but...
But you have to also consider that it needs to compete with the likes of the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console.
They need to get all their cards out just to be in the same footing.
You know what they need?
Achievement points.
Seriously.
That too.
All right.
Zaku, gotta let you go, but thanks so much for the call.
All right.
Later, buddy.
All right.
Bye.
That's it.
All right.
I just feel bad for this one.
Hi, who's this?
It's Ranma.
You know, I'm still pissed that I was on a pod coming up from a con while I missed an awesome show last week.
I'm sorry to hear that.
30 seconds.
Quick, con review.
Okay.
Con was great.
One of the guys in the chat, Mr. Wonderful, will be doing a complete con report for you guys and you should have it by next week.
Also to reiterate for Best Buy, yes, they do price max, but the trick is there's got to be a local store in the area.
How's that?
That's beautiful.
Thank you, Ranma.
Later.
Bye.
All our calls should be like that.
Wow, he's like fucking in and out.
He knows the sound of it.
I know.
You just do that every time.
In and out.
Like, get it out.
Beautiful.
Whip it out now.
30 seconds or die.
That'd be beautiful.
Okay.
All right.
I don't know what just happened there, but I do know it's time to ask if there's any last-minute stories.
Loki?
Loki has his hand out for a microphone.
Give me...
LaserCats
Speaking of which, God damn it, right there, that's what the PlayStation 3 needs.
LaserCats the game.
Show of hands, if they put out LaserCats the game on the PlayStation 3, who would buy?
All the hands in the room are up.
My feet are up too.
Oh my god, there it is.
Dude, somebody put a phone call into Sony right now.
Dude, look up Sony's number.
Can we call them right now?
And speaking of which, we need to go play LaserCats.
Yo, soon.
Alright, fine.
Keys are true.
Dude, LaserCats, the game could save the PlayStation 3.
Oh my god.
I want a LaserCat.
I really do.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, do they?
Oh my god, they totally should.
Paradox, Vincent, Chat, Hands, Feet, SSJ100, Matt, LaserCats over Thundercats.
ActDeft says nope.
No, they should just have a LaserCats cover for the Wiimote.
There you go.
Alright, sorry to interrupt.
Anyway.
Let's make one.
We'll sell it on eBay.
Just like cut out a stuffed animal cat.
Just like take the stuffing out of a stuffed animal cat.
No, no, no.
And like slide it over the window.
No, we're going to go further.
We're going to get an actual cat, you know, get a taxidermist to make one.
Meow, meow, meow.
Hey, Eddie, you forgot one thing.
I just started using laser cat skin.
I love laser cats.
Oh, God.
We should be designing games.
And cats.
Let's quit the show and start Orange Lounge Games, even though that Konami might sue us over that.
We'll just start, you know, Orange Tabby Cat.
Or, I don't know, we'll start, you know, Peach Lounge Games or something.
That's terrible.
How about Sunrise?
Yeah, there you go, Sunrise.
I don't know, Tangerine.
Or Irene Mooning Me.
I don't know.
All right.
Okay.
Anything else, Loki?
That's about it.
Alright.
We're dorks.
Gaming Nerd says Samurai Laser Cats.
Samurai Laser Cats.
I used to watch that cartoon.
Joshi says Orange Soda Lounge Games.
There you go.
Orange Crush Lounge Games.
Oh my god, that would be another copyright infringement.
Like two at once.
Alright, anyway.
I know.
Moving on, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
Rice Princess, thanks for being here and ruining the show with your dry wit as always.
Your final thought.
Dry wit, what?
Well, I was thinking of this very serious, poignant matter.
It's about time.
Yeah.
Eddie, your final thought.
Hot tubs are cool.
Pervert.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
I hate people!
Loki, your final thought.
Blue mittens!
Loki, your final thought.
I guess reject false... Fuck the reject false icons.
Worship those false icons like never before.
Bow down to the golden cow.
Don't listen to Moses.
I've got a golden cow.
My final thought is
and Ammon Joy.
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.
Please leave us a five-star retune on iTunes.
Please leave us a dig.
What do we have to do?
I will send Rice Princess over there to make love to you if that's what it takes.
It's getting hot.
You should declare your love for Rice Princess in a five-star iTunes review.
Aw, you truly should.
Actually, I got a message from SpeedyF40.
It says, tell Rice Princess that I still have a crush on her because she sounds like a freak.
Aw, that's kind of scary.
There's going to be a love triangle going on here.
Oh, my God.
With who?
All right.
With Stacia.
Do you like farting, Speedy?
What?
Because you need to like that to be with Rice Princess.
Well, Rice Princess will choose who her heart belongs to based on who leaves the most five-star iTunes reviews.
There you go.
And who sends me golden wow.
No, in all seriousness, actually, remember what our new marketing director said.
Tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio.
That's all we ask.
And then if those two people tell two more people... Oh, my God.
Are you Ron Poupeel?
Like, if you tell someone, we'll give you a free food diet drink.
We'll throw in a free Am and Joy egg.
That's already been eaten.
I'll send you the wrapper.
I'll autograph it and put it on eBay.
It'll sell for billions.
It'll sell for nothing.
All right.
We really need to end the show now, so cue the outgoing music, please.
Cue, cue.
