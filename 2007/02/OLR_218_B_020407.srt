00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:19,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening.

5
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:25,553
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taping live on February the 4th of 2007.

6
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:33,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, if you want to join us for a live taping sometime, it's Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

7
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:50,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, we know there's a big football game that just wrapped up, and folks are probably still at their parties, but here we are, because we're loyal to the show, we love you guys, and we love all of you that are in chat right now, even though there is still that football game, post-game stuff going on, and whatever show is on after it this year, and

8
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:51,418
[SPEAKER_07]: and all that stuff going on.

9
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:53,920
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you guys for being loyal and tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

11
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's starting us off in the next segment here?

12
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:09,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently there's news that Sony was basically saying... A spokesman from Sony, Dave... His name sounds like Cracker.

13
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:11,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Craker, I guess.

14
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:18,371
[SPEAKER_05]: He was quoted... They were talking about the whole, you know, format wars and stuff and talking about...

15
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:22,506
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 vs. 360 and stuff.

16
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:30,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one of the things that they were talking about also was the Nintendo Wii and saying that it wasn't even in the same category as PlayStation 3.

17
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:35,017
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, the Wii could be considered as an impulse buy more than anything else.

18
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:40,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Which everyone was like, oh my god, you know, that's so crazy that he would say that, but I don't really think that's a...

19
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:42,837
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:08,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the Wii an impulse buy?

21
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:15,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tell me what average person just happens to have, you know, 350 bucks lying around.

22
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, usually we have things to pay, like bills.

23
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, that's a car payment, you know?

24
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, somehow the three of us manage it.

25
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:29,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but we also, you know, if we were responsible about it, planned out that purchase, right?

26
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:32,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and I did not budget a PlayStation 3.

27
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:34,003
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I didn't buy them.

28
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:36,944
[SPEAKER_03]: We budgeted our PlayStation 3, we budgeted our Wii...

29
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:41,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I budgeted the Wii, but I did not budget a PlayStation 3, which is why I don't have one.

30
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:51,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to have mine three days early, so... And JV Mon in our chatroom comes back with the classic, Your mom is an impulse buy.

31
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:53,013
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty funny.

32
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:54,653
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I said JV Mon.

33
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:55,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Last night!

34
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:57,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

35
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And TheRobD says, That's what happens when it's at a lower price than $599 US dollars.

36
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:03,856
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little easier to be in it.

37
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It has more than 15 games.

38
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:06,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm...

39
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:08,914
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not downloading new content for me.

41
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:34,754
[SPEAKER_05]: All it's doing is sending me messages that I can download some more content.

42
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking where is this automatic downloading shit?

43
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:40,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there for the purpose of illuminating your living room in a blue glow.

44
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:46,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo does not like to come out swinging with their stuff.

45
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Haven't you noticed this about them?

46
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:50,258
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't like to reveal all the secrets of their consoles.

47
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:51,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Like look at what happened with the DS.

48
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:55,639
[SPEAKER_07]: No one knew that thing would have voice thing over the internet or even have internet play at all.

49
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was kind of hinted at, but never was that announced.

50
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:02,291
[SPEAKER_07]: But Nintendo, for whatever reason, chooses to roll this out slowly.

51
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360, they come out swinging.

52
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:08,253
[SPEAKER_07]: They lay their cock out on the table and say, thwack, here you go.

53
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:09,813
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all right here.

54
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:19,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's really a fundamental difference between Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo is the way they kind of... Even Sony, their online network, there's nothing on there.

55
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:20,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me something to buy.

56
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:21,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemmings?

57
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:23,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Gran Turismo.

58
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:25,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Gran Turismo's free, okay?

59
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,179
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's still nothing to buy in there.

60
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,179
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no new demos.

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,320
[SPEAKER_05]: There's PSP download games.

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,201
[SPEAKER_05]: That's completely useless.

63
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:33,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Make the PSP download that shit.

64
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do I have to have a PlayStation 3 to download this crap?

65
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:41,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the PSP is capable of downloading this stuff to, you know, off the internet.

66
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:45,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if it's, you know, going to take too long to do that, download it on your PC.

67
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:46,767
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be able to be done.

68
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it probably sells some more of those virtual, you know, those...

69
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:51,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

70
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:06,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

71
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:22,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

72
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:24,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And only one game... Old games.

73
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:26,966
[SPEAKER_05]: One game supports Wii Connect 24, and that's Elebits.

74
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:30,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, I haven't gotten shit from Elebits, you know, on the Wii Connect 24.

75
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like me to send you an Elebit picture for use in Elebits?

76
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do this for you, so you'll stop being such a bitch.

77
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:35,934
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

78
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:36,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.

79
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:44,401
[SPEAKER_05]: But the whole thing, it's just, you know, I thought that this would eliminate the fact of me having to wait to download these updates or, you know, whatever.

80
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:46,083
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, they're not using this shit.

81
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:51,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back to a very dirty comment I made earlier.

82
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:54,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma says, Xbox 360's cock puts a consumer's eye out.

83
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,692
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya says, Rob just likes to say cock.

84
00:05:58,153 --> 00:05:58,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't?

85
00:05:59,254 --> 00:05:59,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't?

86
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:01,215
[SPEAKER_02]: You like to say other things.

87
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:02,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to say all dirty words.

88
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to say all types of dirty words.

89
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:04,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't?

90
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, even though we saw that Sony was being cocky in that last story.

91
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:10,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

92
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:10,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Cock.

93
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,151
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Nintendo accepting an award.

94
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:19,873
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii and WarioWare won an International Toy Fair award.

95
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:25,576
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool, except when they said WarioWare won, they spelled it W-E-A-R.

96
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:37,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyway, they won this International Toy Fair award, and they chose the Wii because, quote, encourages playing PC games in groups instead of alone, even though it's

97
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:39,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really a PC game.

98
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:40,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's a whole other story.

99
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:46,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, quote, the product not only appeals to player types with an affinity to PCs, but also to new age groups.

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Making it sound like I'm going to like, you know, take herbs.

101
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,145
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking out of their ass.

102
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:58,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just these folks, you know, they don't really deal with gaming every day.

103
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:59,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, you know.

104
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:02,550
[SPEAKER_07]: They're used to giving awards to like Tickle Me Elmo.

105
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:15,200
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's kind of what makes this newsworthy is that the Wii has kind of jumped that boundary as becoming recognition as a toy in general and not just a gaming system.

106
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of interesting.

107
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:17,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

108
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:19,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't think they get it.

109
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:22,066
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think this is pretty cool information though.

110
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:26,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Atari Europe is announcing a Godzilla game for the Wii.

111
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry for the...

112
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:30,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

113
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,292
[SPEAKER_03]: and are aiming for the title of King of All Monsters.

114
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be Queen, Godzilla's female.

115
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,574
[SPEAKER_03]: She laid eggs.

116
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:02,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

117
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:11,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but it's a game that you basically work the storyline as you progress.

118
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty cool.

119
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Very dynamic.

120
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:17,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially given that you're using the Wii controller for it.

121
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:20,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm glad to see Rampage is coming out over there.

122
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:20,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

123
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:22,976
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

124
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:44,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

125
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I getting the finger?

126
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:08,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

127
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Mothra wouldn't use shit.

128
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:11,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually when it's silent, I'm getting the finger.

129
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:17,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Would Mothra just fly up into space and fly into the sun because moths are, you know, attracted to fire?

130
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Moths are stupid.

131
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:23,071
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a dumb... Why the hell would they create a moth, you know, monster anyways?

132
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,392
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the dumbest thing ever.

133
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,275
[SPEAKER_03]: But Gamera was cool.

134
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamera is really neat.

135
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:31,315
[SPEAKER_07]: FlyingTurtle.

136
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:34,936
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time I played a Godzilla game was the old-ass NES game.

137
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:37,157
[SPEAKER_05]: The Super NES game was fucking awesome.

138
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:38,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it NES?

139
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:38,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

140
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:39,518
[SPEAKER_07]: It was NES.

141
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:43,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had a King of Monsters game, which wasn't really Godzilla, but pretty much.

142
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,099
[SPEAKER_07]: On Neo Geo.

143
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:45,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

144
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget it.

145
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:55,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what's kind of interesting, though, and this is, I guess, you know, your random Nintendo game sighting.

146
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:58,063
[SPEAKER_05]: They have an Easter egg in their

147
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:16,417
[SPEAKER_05]: DS Dictionary thing, because we don't get any actual non-games over here, but apparently, if you look up the word for ball, you can actually find, it says one of two translations in the dictionary, one of them that's grayed out.

148
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:22,421
[SPEAKER_05]: If you click on the grayed out one, it brings up the Game & Watch game, Ball, so you get to play that.

149
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a little Easter egg that's thrown in there.

150
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hooray, I love Ball.

151
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:30,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Mr. Game & Watch.

152
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:55,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, of course, a lot of these rumors come from patents and trademark offices, and that's where GoNintendo's getting their idea from.

153
00:10:56,206 --> 00:11:02,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo filed a punch-out trademark again in April of 2005, and it was recently updated on January 11th.

154
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:17,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, who knows if they're just kind of holding on to it, just making sure no one else tries to take the name or whatever they're doing, but certainly when you look at something like Wii Boxing, you can't help but go, it's just a matter of time before this comes out on, you know, punch-out on the...

155
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,060
[SPEAKER_07]: on the Wii.

156
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,441
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too bad it won't be Mike Tyson's Punch Out, though.

157
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:23,963
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be Mike Tyson's Ear Fest.

158
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:29,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Mike Tyson's... Never mind.

159
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make a really bad joke here.

160
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:33,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on before I get myself in trouble.

161
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,449
[SPEAKER_02]: You know... I just wanted to say I really love this game.

162
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:39,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Nintendo Wii.

163
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure his Wii... Never mind.

164
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I love Biting Off Ears and Rape.

165
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this should make a lot of people very, very happy.

166
00:11:51,003 --> 00:12:00,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's favorite luchador, Strong Bad, is on the Wii, kinda.

167
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:15,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Our favorite developer, VitElectrics, has created VDeletrics, which is a collection of some of their games that are remastered for Wii Control.

168
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:24,539
[SPEAKER_03]: and the quote says the guys at VitElectrics have reworked a few of your favorite games for use on your favorite wave around controller game system.

169
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is great.

170
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:37,948
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Strong Bad Zone, Secret Collect, Kid Speedy, More to Come, Population Tire, and More to Come.

171
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:46,154
[SPEAKER_03]: You can basically go to your Wii browser to the I guess

172
00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:52,085
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the VitElectrics page that, of course, is associated with HomestarRunner.com.

173
00:12:53,506 --> 00:13:00,630
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's V-I-D-E-L-E-C-T-R-I-X dot com slash V-I-I-V-E.

174
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:07,387
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I predicted a while ago Homestar Runner was going to jump the shark and sell out to, like, Cartoon Network, but I guess I've been wrong.

175
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:10,849
[SPEAKER_07]: They still have been just kind of trekking along with their web following there.

176
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:15,971
[SPEAKER_07]: But now it's interesting to kind of see them tiptoeing into the console games a little bit, you know?

177
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:25,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think it's pretty great that this started off as, you know, kind of not that great books for children, and it just turned into this big internet phenomenon.

178
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:25,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

179
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,321
[SPEAKER_07]: It just goes to show that good things come to those who wait, right?

180
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:32,382
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a Peasants Tale the game on Wii.

181
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:37,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So since we've been doing this show five years now, just about, we should be getting those rewards anytime soon now, huh?

182
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:38,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

183
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:39,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

184
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:40,525
[SPEAKER_02]: That was funny.

185
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,626
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just be right here waiting for you.

186
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:44,227
[SPEAKER_02]: La la la la la.

187
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:52,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, other things you can do with your Wii, of course, non-kosher things like modding it.

188
00:13:53,666 --> 00:14:00,210
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, there have been three teams that have been releasing their announcements for Wii mod chips.

189
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:06,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So, before or not, we're going to have backups and region-free Wiis, which is always good.

190
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:08,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the region-free part, at least.

191
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:26,673
[SPEAKER_05]: One of these teams, Team Cyclops, they announced their Wii mod chip, which is supposed to be able to play backups of both Wii and GameCube games, GameCube Homebrew, imports of GameCube games, as well as DVD-R and support.

192
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:31,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're supposed to be able to have it as stealth as well.

193
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:37,960
[SPEAKER_05]: One other one that's actually supposed to be coming out pretty soon is called the Wii Key.

194
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:45,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And that one's also going to be able to be updated via DVD, so it's supposed to be future-proof, much like the PlayStation 3.

195
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:56,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's supposed to be able to play backups of both Wii and GameCube games, different region GameCube games and backups, multi-disc games, and etc.

196
00:14:56,544 --> 00:15:04,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, this one's actually supposed to start shipping on February 7th, so maybe we'll find out a little bit more of this next week.

197
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:05,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, interesting.

198
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:07,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to order one?

199
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:11,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to solder for shit, so probably not.

200
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you used to do that.

201
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:16,650
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've seen any of my solder jobs, they're awful.

202
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:22,854
[SPEAKER_03]: You know somebody who has a very expensive soldering iron who has experience with doing these types of things now?

203
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:24,396
[SPEAKER_07]: You?

204
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:25,977
[SPEAKER_03]: My hubby.

205
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:28,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, from the pinball stuff.

206
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:30,640
[SPEAKER_03]: He fixes his own pinball machines and has put together his main cabinets.

207
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get him to mod your Wii.

208
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:32,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

209
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:32,622
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

210
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:40,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyhow, one thing that you can do on the Wii, of course, is play old games, which is funny because, you know, most people want to hack them to install emulators on them.

211
00:15:40,084 --> 00:15:41,104
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Wii has one built in.

212
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:49,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But the emulators are not perfect, as folks are finding out this week in downloading Mario Kart 64, because you cannot save ghost data in Mario Kart 64.

213
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:49,988
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

214
00:15:50,368 --> 00:16:00,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo says, quote, due to unavoidable technical reasons, unfortunately, it is not possible to save ghost data from Mario 64's time trials in the virtual console version of the game.

215
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:10,173
[SPEAKER_07]: They did place messages advising users about this before they download the game when the Wii Shop channel is first accessed and in the More Details tab on the individual game page.

216
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:10,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's true.

217
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:12,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I did notice that in the manual.

218
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:14,395
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in big red letters.

219
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,016
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't save ghost data.

220
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:18,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly think people are making too big a deal out of this.

221
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:23,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have a memory pack when I owned Mario Kart 64, so I never had ghost data anyway.

222
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:26,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, how many people had a Nintendo 64, let alone the memory pack?

223
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:30,655
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

224
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:51,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Like virtual memory cards on the PlayStation 3.

225
00:16:51,792 --> 00:17:01,497
[SPEAKER_07]: But you'd be talking about going in and editing Mario Kart 64's game information to do that, because it'd be talking about accessing data a whole other way.

226
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:04,558
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to rewrite the game, recompile the game.

227
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:07,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps they could patch it with, I don't know...

228
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:10,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Weekend Act 24 that they're not using?

229
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:10,972
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to do it.

230
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:12,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo says they're not going to do it.

231
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,957
[SPEAKER_03]: The PC emulators, though, always saved the information.

232
00:17:16,238 --> 00:17:24,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the ROMs themselves actually have the emulator built into it when you're downloading it, so it wouldn't be that hard for them to fix that.

233
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,409
[SPEAKER_03]: All they have to do is edit the emulator.

234
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:27,650
[SPEAKER_05]: But no.

235
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:29,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, why should they?

236
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:32,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Because no one really cares about that shit anyways.

237
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Legend of Zaku agrees and says, ghost data?

238
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:35,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Who the fuck uses that?

239
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:38,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's probably followed up by Boko Fett saying, I love ghost mode.

240
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob D seems to agree they could include a patch with the game.

241
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,897
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all coming from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

242
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Hitstun says, oh, come on, you can't emulate a friggin' controller pack?

243
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:51,939
[SPEAKER_07]: NM64 says, Sky, I think you only download the emulator once per system.

244
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure on the specifics of that, possibly.

245
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:24,592
[SPEAKER_05]: But you see, the thing though is once you've purchased the game, you can delete it and re-download it again.

246
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:29,993
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that's the case, they can say, okay, there's an update to this game, please re-download it, and boom, done.

247
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:32,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I thought WeConnect24 was supposed to do all that automatically.

248
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:37,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, WeConnect24 is a service that they sell but don't actually fucking use.

249
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:39,215
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not a surprise.

250
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,036
[SPEAKER_07]: They did the same thing on the DS.

251
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:42,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing.

252
00:18:43,837 --> 00:18:44,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

253
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:45,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, anyhow.

254
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:46,429
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

255
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Slim Pickens this week, though, right, DarkSakura?

256
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot of emails?

257
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:14,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we got a bunch of big fat ones.

258
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:14,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there you go.

259
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:15,988
[SPEAKER_07]: We like long letters.

260
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the emails comes from GS191.

261
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:25,216
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I'm not reading the part about Jennifer Strange because, honestly, I'm sick of it.

262
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:28,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Although we appreciate the feedback, I think we're all trying to move on from that whole thing.

263
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:29,680
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you for your insight.

264
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty much a lot of the same as, you know, what we're thinking.

265
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:32,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

266
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:41,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was also the disclaimer that we didn't have... Just because Loki wasn't on a mic, Loki said, we just can't continue to drown ourselves in that information.

267
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:43,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like meat in here.

268
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's eating a hamburger and he left the cart open, which you know what that means.

269
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:48,465
[SPEAKER_07]: French fries stealing, fries stealing.

270
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:50,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take like a whole handful.

271
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:52,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go.

272
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:56,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Hurry up and eat them.

273
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:57,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk with your mouth full, hurry.

274
00:19:57,692 --> 00:19:57,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

275
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the flapper map.

276
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:02,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor GS191.

277
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:04,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Gets his email read with fries in our mouth.

278
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:09,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the one reading the email.

279
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:09,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

280
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the Frapper map, the bane of my existence.

281
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I really don't know what to do.

282
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:22,215
[SPEAKER_11]: These are good fries.

283
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,256
[SPEAKER_08]: They're elephant pie.

284
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:23,796
[SPEAKER_08]: They're pretty good.

285
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:25,798
[SPEAKER_11]: That one was too salty, though.

286
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

287
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I really don't know what to do anymore about the Frapper map.

288
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:37,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Ever since the switch from Google Maps to Yahoo Maps, the performance of the website has gone down a lot.

289
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:47,689
[SPEAKER_11]: We really screwed up the editing to the point that you can go to your forums, you can do that, but it takes out the shoutout listings on the Frapper page.

290
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,811
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're forced to use their forums if you want to see shoutouts on the page.

291
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you use your own forums, it automatically takes the shoutouts off the page.

292
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:00,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Being the administrator of the Frapper map

293
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at a fork in the road.

294
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,462
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many times that I was so discontent with the map, I almost leave the map and start over again.

295
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:18,505
[SPEAKER_03]: The one good thing is that there is an embedded HTML option when I customize the map, so that gives me some hope on getting this to where I like it, and hopefully everyone else does too.

296
00:21:19,705 --> 00:21:24,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, the map has 141 members, but I know that there is a much larger community out there.

297
00:21:25,006 --> 00:21:27,747
[SPEAKER_03]: With more support, it will motivate me further, hopefully.

298
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:33,216
[SPEAKER_03]: So as of now, I will keep it up, but if the Frapper screws up again, I just don't know what to do.

299
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:36,379
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to support the Frapper map, and I will do my best to maintain it.

300
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:36,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

301
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:37,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at our Frapper map.

302
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,400
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty nice.

303
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it up on screen here.

304
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:42,463
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to see it, it's Frapper.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

305
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:47,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's really nothing to this besides just the fact it's kind of cool to see where our listeners are.

306
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:52,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And you notice we have a lot scattered throughout the U.S., but what I'm really noticing a lack of

307
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,781
[SPEAKER_07]: is the pins over in the UK.

308
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:55,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.

309
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:56,423
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like three pins over there.

310
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

311
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:58,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we got more listeners than that over there.

312
00:21:58,545 --> 00:21:59,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And then look, Australia.

313
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,808
[SPEAKER_07]: If I go over to Australia, there's like a pin.

314
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to especially not that, you know, we love our US listeners.

315
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:10,036
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to really see some of our international listeners put a pin in the map somewhere.

316
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:13,259
[SPEAKER_07]: But I am going to steal what they do at All Games Interactive.

317
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to replace what's over here.

318
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,362
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to put a big map up here.

319
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:21,710
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're going to put pins in whenever we get calls and emails from different parts of the world.

320
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,571
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have one color for calls and one color for emails.

321
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:25,531
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to start our own real life Frapper.

322
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:29,212
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the meantime, the online one will have to do Frapper.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

323
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:30,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was a fan created thing.

324
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:33,313
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you to this emailer who created it.

325
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:34,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Hugs and kisses.

326
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:36,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, next email.

327
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:37,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, guys.

328
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:39,015
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Dollar Bill here.

329
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:46,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the updates from Konami Gamers Day, which now made my picking of the newest system very difficult.

330
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:47,132
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why.

331
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:55,056
[SPEAKER_03]: This weekend I was in the Chinatown section here in New York, and while browsing through the anime, picked up three series I haven't seen yet.

332
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:58,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also checking out the imports and had some thoughts.

333
00:22:58,518 --> 00:23:03,401
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, in order to play imported games, most systems would need to be modified in some fashion.

334
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:11,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I can recall back in the cartridge systems where you'd have to buy an adapter to play these games or actually just break open your Super Nintendo.

335
00:23:12,164 --> 00:23:13,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that Super Nintendo one was funny.

336
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:20,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Or having your CD, DVD-based systems modified with a mod chip or swap disc or paperclip.

337
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:21,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

338
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:28,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the Game Boy DS systems did not need any modification, which is probably why I enjoyed them the most.

339
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,170
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is this.

340
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,622
[SPEAKER_03]: For the systems I did not list that are current are the following true.

341
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:40,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360, region locked, no safe mod exists, safe as in you will not be banned from Xbox Live.

342
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii, region locked, no mod exists yet.

343
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:45,727
[SPEAKER_03]: PS3, not region locked on PS3 games, region locked on PS2 games.

344
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:47,588
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP, not region locked.

345
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:57,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking this because I'm going to be getting back into purchasing import titles, not just the Ben Mani stuff, but also some of their wrestling games.

346
00:23:58,243 --> 00:24:08,890
[SPEAKER_03]: which has been more original and fun than the SmackDown vs. Raw and other little oddities such as DONDBZ vs. One Piece vs. Naruto.

347
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:18,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care about playing backup copies honestly and I don't want to get one system of each as that would be a waste of money.

348
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:22,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they would just let everyone pick and choose what to play regardless of where it's coming from.

349
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:26,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywho, I could go on for another hour, but I'll leave it like that.

350
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,131
[SPEAKER_03]: See you guys in the chatroom tonight.

351
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:29,792
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

352
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:30,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss free stuff sometimes.

353
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:38,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe the PlayStation 3 regions for the game, at least Blu-ray, I know Region 1 is both Japan and the United States.

354
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:43,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So, when we talk about importing Japanese games, I think that works.

355
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:46,726
[SPEAKER_05]: At least, I don't know about the movies might work, but the games, I'm not sure.

356
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:53,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, once again, you probably just need to check, maybe, with import sites to deal with that kind of stuff, whether that'll work or not.

357
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:55,029
[SPEAKER_05]: 360, I know, doesn't.

358
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be in San Francisco this weekend, so if I go by Mikado, I can ask them there, since they keep up with all that.

359
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:08,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, because I know they were saying that it is and then it isn't, but I know it's not region-free, but I think that we're in the same region as Japan now.

360
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:09,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Interesting.

361
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:10,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

362
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:13,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that makes sense, because we're both NTSC.

363
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:16,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not like it's going to matter for anything in a...

364
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,941
[SPEAKER_03]: High Definition Format, but I can sort of see it.

365
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:23,943
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom says, you can use the GameCube freeloader on the Wii.

366
00:25:24,283 --> 00:25:25,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Positive, I've seen it done.

367
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:26,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a freeloader.

368
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:30,486
[SPEAKER_05]: But, that's only for GameCube games, that's not for Wii games.

369
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:34,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm still going to check it out though, I want to try it for myself.

370
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:38,249
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

371
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:42,951
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really only a matter of time though before anything that is region locked will be unlocked.

372
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I am one of those people who said, I'm not modding my PS2 and went out and bought a JPS2.

373
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:51,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Ditto.

374
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:52,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it too.

375
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:55,488
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 2 Japanese games do not work on a US PlayStation 2.

376
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:57,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a PlayStation 3.

377
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:08,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know somebody in chat, I think Blackboy says PS2 Japanese games work on PlayStation 3, but actually one of the sites had video of trying Kingdom Hearts 2, the import on a PlayStation 3, and it came up with an error message.

378
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:10,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not sure if that's true.

379
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:12,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

380
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:16,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one thing, though, that I am curious about, though, is the freeloader.

381
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:24,570
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're going to have... Well, not the freeloader, but what was the one for PlayStation hard drive?

382
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:26,611
[SPEAKER_05]: HD loader?

383
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:27,912
[SPEAKER_03]: HD loader, that was it.

384
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:29,553
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're going to be coming out with something like that.

385
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:30,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure eventually, someday.

386
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:32,795
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still out there for the PlayStation 2s.

387
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:39,879
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can find the old style one or even the new style one, you can download the HD loader that actually fits on your memory card.

388
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you just plug in a USB drive.

389
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:46,246
[SPEAKER_05]: or USB hard drive or something like that.

390
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:49,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works great for imports.

391
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:53,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they even have the thing where you can, you know, I guess it's the same thing.

392
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:58,937
[SPEAKER_03]: You download it directly to your hard drive on the system.

393
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:09,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not that we're condoning that eye roll, but, you know, I wonder if they're going to have something like that for PS3 and then that makes the importing...

394
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:16,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you remember back in the days with the GameCube how they had the whole GD-ROM rip through the VMU unit.

395
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:17,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

396
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they'd be doing something along those lines too.

397
00:27:20,466 --> 00:27:23,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to clarify, it looks like I understand why I misunderstood Blackboy.

398
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:27,408
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, I've played Japanese PlayStation 2 games on the Japanese PlayStation 3.

399
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:28,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, that'll work.

400
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:32,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought he meant Japanese PlayStation 2 to US PlayStation 3, and that's what the video was of.

401
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:33,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So, oops.

402
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

403
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email, and this comes from Neki, our friend.

404
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:46,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Heya OLR, didn't get around to emailing last week, but I got some stuff today.

405
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:48,372
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my second time typing this.

406
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:51,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Since the first one screwed up, I hope it doesn't happen again.

407
00:27:52,193 --> 00:27:53,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out Attachment 1.

408
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:57,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I didn't actually see there was attachments with this one.

409
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:04,898
[SPEAKER_03]: It will show the Wii with over 4 million sales, the 360 with 10 million, and the PS3 with a tiny 1 million.

410
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:05,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Owned.

411
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:13,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just like to give a big shout out towards my home forum site, dscommunity.co.uk.

412
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,628
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice and fun, so everyone join the forums.

413
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:16,969
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your free shout out.

414
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:28,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, and by the way, we are doing a DS tournament on Wednesday starting from, it looks like July 2nd this year at about 7 to 12 p.m.

415
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:28,893
[SPEAKER_03]: GMT.

416
00:28:29,353 --> 00:28:33,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone is welcome, but it would be a good idea to join the forums first, plus we got chat.

417
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:35,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, there's your free plug.

418
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:35,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Free plug.

419
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, did they plug us on their forums?

420
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:41,033
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

421
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:43,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Plug us on your forums now, because we're awesome.

422
00:28:45,234 --> 00:28:45,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, fries.

423
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:46,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock.

424
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:51,336
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, a question for me is where it got the music... Dude, fries.

425
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:53,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, like, hungry.

426
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:55,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't eaten since those pancakes today.

427
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:55,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, email.

428
00:28:56,197 --> 00:28:56,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry.

429
00:28:58,178 --> 00:28:58,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Neki.

430
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,940
[SPEAKER_03]: A question for me was where did it get the music for the show.

431
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:04,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I really...

432
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:13,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want about the FUs of the week, your website of the week, and the show's ending music.

433
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:19,921
[SPEAKER_03]: The FUs of the week music is actually from the Final Fantasy VII Advent Children movie.

434
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:21,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the One Winged Angel.

435
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,786
[SPEAKER_07]: The big final battle in that movie, yep.

436
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:33,148
[SPEAKER_03]: The website of the week music, isn't that Journey to Wonderland?

437
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,691
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's the mailbag music is Journey to the Wonderland.

438
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:39,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Website of the week is from DDR Ohastas.

439
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:39,992
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

440
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:40,652
[SPEAKER_07]: That's candy.

441
00:29:44,974 --> 00:29:47,634
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually dance to that in a Japanese version of DDR.

442
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:48,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done it.

443
00:29:48,415 --> 00:29:48,895
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

444
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:53,676
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ohasta is the Ohastation kids version.

445
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:54,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cute.

446
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:55,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

447
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:58,218
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the Ohaska?

448
00:29:58,558 --> 00:29:59,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Ohaska.

449
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,532
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a lot of cute songs in it.

450
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:01,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

451
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:05,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And our ending show music, Rob knows that one because it's from Beatmania.

452
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:08,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Sakura Yamaoka, iFutureList.

453
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Also in DDR Supernova, I believe.

454
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:12,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

455
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:16,915
[SPEAKER_07]: The Godly and Studly Akira Yamaoka, who produces Silent Hill now as well.

456
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:21,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually watching the making of Silent Hill 3, and he was in it, and he sounded really hoarse.

457
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:22,037
[SPEAKER_07]: He's such a rock star.

458
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:23,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I met him once, like three years ago.

459
00:30:24,218 --> 00:30:24,738
[SPEAKER_07]: He was pretty cool.

460
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:25,179
[SPEAKER_03]: He was awesome.

461
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:26,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I like his business cards.

462
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:28,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, can't think of anything else.

463
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the podcast.

464
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Really enjoy it.

465
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:30,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it up.

466
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:31,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Nike.

467
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:31,541
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

468
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:34,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a Doctor Who thing you might get very excited about.

469
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:36,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't read it all as it's long.

470
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:37,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctor Who the game?

471
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:39,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

472
00:30:40,524 --> 00:30:41,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we talk about something like that?

473
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:42,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

474
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:45,096
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Bandit.

475
00:31:06,803 --> 00:31:07,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi guys, how's it going?

476
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Been listening to the show for a while and decided to send in an email for a change.

477
00:31:11,946 --> 00:31:16,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to stop and voice an opinion that I've had for a while about moving to the next gen.

478
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:26,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, when you look at the shiny new hardware that's out there from the big three, you may want to go out and buy the newest and greatest, but at this point, I've seen a reason to do so yet.

479
00:31:27,696 --> 00:31:32,939
[SPEAKER_03]: After all of these years of playing games, mostly competitive type games, I've become more of a casual gamer than anything.

480
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I find myself spending more time reading gaming

481
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,842
[SPEAKER_03]: and use through various online sites than actually playing them.

482
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:48,447
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really hard not to just throw down the cash and buy a new console on any of the launches but I had to take a step back and look at what I currently have.

483
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,269
[SPEAKER_03]: The prime console I own is the PS2.

484
00:31:52,269 --> 00:32:01,455
[SPEAKER_03]: When I actually took a look back at the games that I've yet to play over the years I realized that purchasing a new console would be a bad idea especially considering the prices of games now.

485
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:05,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually never played God of War, Devil May Cry 1 or 3 and many...

486
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:11,003
[SPEAKER_03]: and other critically acclaimed titles like these.

487
00:32:11,884 --> 00:32:13,685
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not enough time in the day to play everything.

488
00:32:13,925 --> 00:32:14,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played some of those.

489
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:21,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I really missed a lot of great titles on the PS2 by only playing certain games such as Madden and Tekken 5.

490
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:31,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly with the case of Tekken 5, I would spend hours learning a character's move list and practicing before visiting a group of the best local players here in Pittsburgh who go by the name of Steel City Tekken.

491
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:35,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe me, the practice had to be done to stand a chance against them.

492
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:37,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

493
00:32:55,962 --> 00:32:57,984
[SPEAKER_03]: The price of one $60 next-gen title.

494
00:32:58,524 --> 00:33:08,852
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you haven't yet made the commitment to any new next-gen console, I would go as far as to say that the PS2 has one of the two greatest library of games ever on any console.

495
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:12,394
[SPEAKER_03]: The original NES will always be first, in my opinion.

496
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:15,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Also remember that the PS2 is not dead yet.

497
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:19,940
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have Luminous Live, God of War 2, and Final Cut of Kingdom Hearts 2 to play soon.

498
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:25,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I decided to stick with the PS2 a little longer, I went out and picked up a few games that I missed.

499
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:33,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I grabbed Syphon Filter Omega Stream, Devil May Cry Collector's Box Set, and Area 51, not the original that was in the arcades on the PS1 Saturn, for less than $60.

500
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:37,394
[SPEAKER_03]: A 5 to 1 game ratio really sounds good to me right now.

501
00:33:38,094 --> 00:33:41,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I could write much more to prove my point, but I'm sure everyone can see where I'm coming from.

502
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, have a great show, and long live the PS2.

503
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:48,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I stopped playing Kingdom Hearts 2 as soon as they announced the final cut because I'm going to start over on that one

504
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,151
[SPEAKER_07]: ShadowHeartsRPG Series ShadowHeartsRPG Series

505
00:34:27,259 --> 00:34:28,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for taking so long.

506
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely recommend that you give this series a try.

507
00:34:31,182 --> 00:34:34,624
[SPEAKER_03]: The first Shadow Hearts game, however, is hard to find, so you might have to find it on eBay.

508
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:36,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in your opinions about the series.

509
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:37,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great night.

510
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:38,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow Next Gen.

511
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:42,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have various links to them, so I'm going to check them out a little bit later.

512
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:44,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadow Hearts, the series?

513
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

514
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the last one that came out, New World, looked pretty good.

515
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:53,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't play it because I don't have time to play every obscure RPG out there.

516
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:53,956
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um,

517
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:55,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looked pretty cool.

518
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:59,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a unique concept, kind of set in the 1940s, I believe.

519
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:22,732
[SPEAKER_05]: And you play like a detective son who ends up finding these portals to another dimension almost, and this stuff starts coming through and basically has to fight it with a bunch of your usual typical RPG plot, a bunch of people that have no reason to be together, kind of come together and then

520
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Fight Monsters and stuff.

521
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,674
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a lot of folks in the chatroom agree with my gamer ADD perspective.

522
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:33,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, you're not the only one who does that.

523
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:35,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Paradox Vincent says, OMG, thank you, Sky.

524
00:35:35,598 --> 00:35:36,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, thank you.

525
00:35:36,198 --> 00:35:36,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not alone.

526
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:38,039
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I play music games.

527
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:50,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, to go back to what I had said in Part A about somebody had said all I ever seem to play are Xbox Live Arcade games, I think that might go help to explain it right there is that Xbox Live Arcade games, again, they're quick and not a lot of time and really satisfy my gamer ADD.

528
00:35:51,587 --> 00:35:54,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet why I keep going back to World of Warcraft, I'll never understand.

529
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:55,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the social aspect of that.

530
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,033
[SPEAKER_03]: My whole thing is, that's sort of why I was stuck on Cooking Mama for that long.

531
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:23,910
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, I was thinking about it, and I own a lot of games that I haven't given the attention that I'd like to give So like, I'm going back, I've started over on Popola Cross, just because you know how I was up in arms about how much I wanted to play that game You know, for years, and so I actually started over on Popola Cross so I can get to where I got before and actually play through it this time

532
00:36:24,335 --> 00:36:25,496
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

533
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:51,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not getting paid to play games eight hours a day.

534
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,718
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody wanted to do that, great.

535
00:36:52,778 --> 00:37:01,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because essentially that's what you do when you visit those big websites like, you know, I'm not going to name them, but the ones that are sponsored by magazine companies and things.

536
00:37:02,104 --> 00:37:12,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, keep in mind, like, just my next week, I'm going to school four nights next week, doing a CPR class, working on a website, working on art commissions, and working full time.

537
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that's a standard week.

538
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,652
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I...

539
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:27,185
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't get to have free time all the time to do all the stuff that we would like to do, to play all the games.

540
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:28,985
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I do have free time, it's all about the games.

541
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:40,528
[SPEAKER_03]: What I was trying to say is that that's why when we do the show, we actually come and tell each other so that we can each give each other the impression of what we're looking at.

542
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:45,830
[SPEAKER_03]: What's quick and easy to play, what's going to be a little time consuming, what project's going on, that type of thing.

543
00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:47,946
[SPEAKER_03]: and no more email, by the way.

544
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:48,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes sense.

545
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:50,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I got some spam, which I deleted.

546
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:51,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I can say this.

547
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:59,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I got an email and I neglected to mention this during housekeeping, but I'll mention it next week so it's at the top of the show because I know not everyone listens to the whole thing.

548
00:37:59,754 --> 00:38:10,362
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to confirm that Orange Lingerie is going to be back at Faname Con this year, which is being held from May 25th to May 28th at the San Jose Convention Center in California.

549
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:13,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

550
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:15,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there for the weekend.

551
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:18,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I just found this out too.

552
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:26,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's younger brother, his stepbrother, is getting married the weekend before that.

553
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:29,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will definitely be there Saturday and Sunday.

554
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:32,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Friday afternoon if I can at all.

555
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,181
[SPEAKER_03]: FanimeCon is the sideshow.

556
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:09,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely need to remake my Tamari costume because the last one that was made was too big.

557
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:11,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually thinking about starting to watch Bleach.

558
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:54,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I watch Bleach and I pour it in the washer alright anyways so not having anything to do with Bleach or anime or anything like that apparently well unless you lived under a rock or something you probably didn't realize well Vista just came out all 50 billion OMG it did?

559
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,520
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah really I'm just rushing right out to go buy it

560
00:39:58,939 --> 00:39:59,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I did with XP.

561
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:13,722
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you happen to be gaming on a PC that has the parental control set on it, it might actually break some of your casual games like games that use Wild Tangent.

562
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:18,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And according to your gamer, DirectX creator Alex St.

563
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:26,905
[SPEAKER_05]: John says basically that they tried making sure that it wouldn't break

564
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:55,048
[SPEAKER_05]: all the different games out there they thought they covered everything but unfortunately Wild Tangent is denoted as spyware by the anti-spyware applications in Vista and says normally the software is generally harmless but it does get installed without isn't Wild Tangent the games that come with AOL Instant Messenger because those games are spyware I'm sorry yeah I think so Wild Tangent is spyware so

565
00:40:55,765 --> 00:41:00,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, I mean, it's not a huge deal, but just thought you might want to know.

566
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:08,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there are some people that like casual games like Christopher and... Blackboy says, wow, Loki's news is old, they patched this already.

567
00:41:09,695 --> 00:41:10,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is old.

568
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:13,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's just like, I don't care.

569
00:41:13,477 --> 00:41:19,301
[SPEAKER_07]: But nevertheless, you know, isn't it funny that they rolled out an operating system and it broke half the games on it?

570
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:21,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, why should I upgrade to Windows Vista?

571
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:22,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody?

572
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:22,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody.

573
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:27,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Would anybody like to tell me why I need to drop the money right now to upgrade to Windows Vista?

574
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:27,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to.

575
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:28,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you have to upgrade your computer, too.

576
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't, what?

577
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:30,800
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to upgrade your computer, too.

578
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand why I need to upgrade right now.

579
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:34,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not.

580
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:37,424
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all the more reason for me to just buy my iMac.

581
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:38,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw Windows.

582
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:42,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, between the PC I have now and the Mac, I'm doing just fine.

583
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:44,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need Windows Vista.

584
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:44,888
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

585
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:46,849
[SPEAKER_07]: You look like you want to say something smart-ass so bad.

586
00:41:47,649 --> 00:41:48,130
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hurting you.

587
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:48,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

588
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,310
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

589
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:49,751
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

590
00:41:49,771 --> 00:41:51,191
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are fine with your Macs.

591
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:52,332
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great, you know.

592
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure games will come to it eventually.

593
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:59,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play PC games, and the only PC game I play is World of Warcraft.

594
00:41:59,622 --> 00:42:01,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have Guild Wars on my laptop, so I don't have to worry about it.

595
00:42:02,443 --> 00:42:05,424
[SPEAKER_07]: JeremyTodd1 says, There's no reason to upgrade right now.

596
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:06,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Simple as that.

597
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:08,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Just upgrade in a couple of years and there's actually a reason to upgrade.

598
00:42:09,746 --> 00:42:12,427
[SPEAKER_07]: DDRDollarBill says, Vista has had a lot of returns.

599
00:42:12,807 --> 00:42:13,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

600
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:15,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

601
00:42:15,568 --> 00:42:15,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe later.

602
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:18,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha.

603
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:19,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Vista doesn't run anything.

604
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:20,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

605
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:21,752
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

606
00:42:40,402 --> 00:42:40,782
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

607
00:42:58,715 --> 00:42:59,316
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

608
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:31,545
[SPEAKER_07]: We look forward to extending that commitment with this expansion as well as with future Blizzard releases.

609
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:37,790
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like if we get it here, you're going to get it in China from the 9, even if it is a little bit later on.

610
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,051
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to just wait for all the localization and stuff.

611
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:46,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have to do that for Japanese games, so it's only fair that that side of the world has to wait for us once in a while.

612
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:48,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then they get the joy of patching.

613
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:50,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, how beautiful.

614
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:52,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you get to patch World of Warcraft seven times before you can play it.

615
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:53,076
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much fun.

616
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:55,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it won't patch, and then you have to download it and do it yourself.

617
00:43:55,997 --> 00:43:56,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

618
00:43:56,777 --> 00:43:57,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

619
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:59,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, can I suggest this real quick?

620
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,960
[SPEAKER_07]: X-Fire has a patching system built in that's actually pretty good.

621
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:07,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say, you wouldn't think I would usually endorse a program like X-Fire, but it actually is really cool.

622
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:08,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like X-Fire.

623
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:12,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a great little application, anyway, for a PC gamer.

624
00:44:12,264 --> 00:44:12,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

625
00:44:12,785 --> 00:44:13,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, take your word for it, Rob.

626
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:14,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, please do.

627
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:14,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

628
00:44:16,494 --> 00:44:20,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of MMOs, there is an MMO coming to the UK.

629
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Two Worlds.

630
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:26,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being released on a PC and Xbox 360.

631
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:35,551
[SPEAKER_03]: The good thing about it, it's a free-roaming RPG that's the orc versus human deal.

632
00:44:38,654 --> 00:44:40,376
[SPEAKER_03]: But the cool thing is that it's...

633
00:44:44,093 --> 00:44:45,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting tongue-tied today.

634
00:44:46,534 --> 00:44:55,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It has unique quests, a one-on-one arena battle, horse races, and customizable characters with no level capping.

635
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:57,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

636
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I can truly be a god character in that game.

637
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear it's very similar to... Oblivion.

638
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:04,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

639
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:05,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Very similar to Oblivion.

640
00:45:05,684 --> 00:45:08,485
[SPEAKER_07]: JeremyTel1 wants to point out and clarify from what he's read about the game.

641
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,966
[SPEAKER_07]: The 360 version only has 8-player multiplayer.

642
00:45:11,046 --> 00:45:12,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Only the PC version is an MMO.

643
00:45:13,448 --> 00:45:14,468
[SPEAKER_07]: 8 players is still not bad.

644
00:45:14,988 --> 00:45:15,589
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still fun.

645
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,669
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still an OL army.

646
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:18,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And 8 players.

647
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:19,030
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be fun.

648
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's what I want to know, because I haven't really read up on much.

649
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if Crackdown is more than two players co-op, because that'd be awesome if you have like four people.

650
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:28,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

651
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

652
00:45:30,413 --> 00:45:33,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we'll see more when the game comes out, because if it's coming on 360, we'll probably get a demo.

653
00:45:34,254 --> 00:45:34,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So who knows?

654
00:45:35,714 --> 00:45:35,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

655
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:37,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so...

656
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,631
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures

657
00:46:02,545 --> 00:46:07,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so that's gonna become an Alien Hominid HD, which is kind of an HD upgrade to the original Alien Hominid game.

658
00:46:08,447 --> 00:46:11,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Band of Bugs, which is supposed to be by Ninja Bee.

659
00:46:11,128 --> 00:46:13,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a, I guess, a strategy game.

660
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:14,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's kind of neat.

661
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania Symphony of Night.

662
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,531
[SPEAKER_05]: No big surprise there.

663
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:18,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Catan.

664
00:46:18,771 --> 00:46:19,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Settlers Catan.

665
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:22,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, that was one that was rumored to be coming at some point.

666
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:22,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Eats.

667
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Chowdown.

668
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:26,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, kind of a

669
00:46:26,858 --> 00:46:29,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Different game, I guess it's a port of a PC title by the same name.

670
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Luxor 2, which should make Nelly happy, another kind of Zuma clone type of thing.

671
00:46:35,524 --> 00:46:38,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Paperboy, Rootbeard Tapper.

672
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:40,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Paperboy and Rootbeard Tapper are awesome.

673
00:46:40,408 --> 00:46:45,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you guys bitch about the classic coin-op ports, but these are some true classics that are underrated, I think.

674
00:46:46,252 --> 00:46:51,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my favorite of the list here, Worms HD is going to be coming out, and that's awesome.

675
00:46:52,716 --> 00:46:55,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have epic Worms...

676
00:46:57,422 --> 00:46:58,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Worms is awesome.

677
00:46:58,322 --> 00:46:59,043
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's interesting, though?

678
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:04,206
[SPEAKER_07]: We neglected to say this in our coverage of Konami Gamers Day, but did you notice they had nothing on Xbox Live Arcade?

679
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:08,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very surprised we didn't see Castlevania Symphony of the Night on our Live Arcade, because they had it at CES.

680
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:13,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have thought that's what they would have used their 360s for instead of showing Wii 11.

681
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:17,514
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of what I thought we were going to see, too, but I guess not.

682
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:18,094
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

683
00:47:19,701 --> 00:47:19,861
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOXLIVE

684
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:41,469
[SPEAKER_07]: That's without Halo 3 beta stuff.

685
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:46,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if people are maybe downloading this to see if it's worth it, if they want to do the Halo 3.

686
00:47:46,514 --> 00:47:47,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played the demo.

687
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:49,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't get into it.

688
00:47:49,276 --> 00:47:53,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to do co-op with somebody who can kind of show me what the hell I'm supposed to be doing because I didn't get it.

689
00:47:54,675 --> 00:47:55,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm stupid sometimes.

690
00:47:55,335 --> 00:47:59,577
[SPEAKER_05]: You can punch people and throw them in the cars and then throw cars on top of them.

691
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try it again.

692
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:08,300
[SPEAKER_05]: What's great, though, is they have achievements for throwing dead bodies into the air and then bouncing rockets off of them.

693
00:48:08,781 --> 00:48:12,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just have to come over and watch you play at some point and see if it's worth it for me.

694
00:48:12,662 --> 00:48:16,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear I'm going to sign up for a game rental site or something this week so I stop buying all this stuff new.

695
00:48:17,404 --> 00:48:17,764
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

696
00:48:19,685 --> 00:48:22,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I guess that's all I have to say about Crackdown.

697
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:35,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is different games to be downloaded, especially Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live Arcade.

698
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:49,565
[SPEAKER_03]: They were talking about the memory card coming out that was supposed to be 256 megabytes, but the pre-order on GameStop's website is 512 megabytes for the portable memory.

699
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:52,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, they gave it a secret upgrade.

700
00:48:52,907 --> 00:48:53,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's 512.

701
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,281
[SPEAKER_07]: or is it a typo on GameStop's end?

702
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:57,362
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think, Loki?

703
00:48:57,662 --> 00:49:09,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard of anything official about them upgrading that, although I'm assuming that we'll find something new or find out something about it pretty soon, if not at all.

704
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:11,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems kind of logical that would happen, though, right?

705
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:13,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

706
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:20,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it makes sense, because 256, to me, the price point for it was a bit more expensive, and I mean, really...

707
00:49:21,343 --> 00:49:22,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why you'd buy a memory unit anyways.

708
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:25,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, spend the extra money and just get a hard drive.

709
00:49:25,226 --> 00:49:26,026
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I say.

710
00:49:26,126 --> 00:49:29,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Just get the damn hard drive, unless you really have a need to take that shit with you on the go.

711
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:30,810
[SPEAKER_07]: There's really no point.

712
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:31,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

713
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:36,333
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, no idea if this is official yet.

714
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:42,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine, I don't think it's going to be a typo, because I think originally they had 256 on there, so they probably just got it updated.

715
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:43,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

716
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:44,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

717
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:45,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll keep my eyes out.

718
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do.

719
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:47,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Eyes and ears.

720
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:48,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll have to check them out.

721
00:49:50,854 --> 00:50:03,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, beyond the bigger memory cards, there is going to be another epic game coming to the Xbox 360, as well as a PlayStation 3 Unreal Tournament.

722
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:14,845
[SPEAKER_05]: One unique thing about this, and I think we mentioned this back on an earlier show, they're going to be allowing mods to be used on the PlayStation 3 and the 360 version, probably as well as the PC.

723
00:50:16,204 --> 00:50:20,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, they're also going to be including user-created mods as well.

724
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:29,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's actually kind of cool that they're allowing mods on there, because I know there's been some pretty good mods available for, you know, just Unreal and Half-Life 2 and stuff.

725
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:32,298
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be really cool to see some of the stuff downloadable online.

726
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, no idea when this game's coming out.

727
00:50:37,145 --> 00:50:39,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the idea of user mods coming out online.

728
00:50:39,866 --> 00:50:51,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the only time I can think of user-created content outside of an MMO that I've seen on Xbox, it would be DDR steps on DDR Ultramix 2 through 4 or whatever had the steps you could download online.

729
00:50:52,313 --> 00:50:55,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't see a whole lot of user-created content, so that's kind of cool, I think.

730
00:50:55,775 --> 00:50:55,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

731
00:50:57,622 --> 00:51:03,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, what's kind of cool, a Flash-based computer game called N. Which I used to play religiously.

732
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:05,747
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

733
00:51:06,908 --> 00:51:09,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Describe N. I've never played N. What is N all about, Loki?

734
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:16,354
[SPEAKER_05]: N kind of has this stick figure, like ninja type of character that you run around and you're collecting... Oh, God, I've watched you play this game before.

735
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:18,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what... Okay, sorry, keep going.

736
00:51:18,939 --> 00:51:20,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, it's pretty awesome though.

737
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:30,443
[SPEAKER_05]: You just run around and you collect stuff and there's like, as the levels get, you know, go on it gets harder and harder and there's like missiles and stuff you have to dodge and you just have to make it through like the time limit and stuff.

738
00:51:30,563 --> 00:51:32,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I've totally seen you play this game before.

739
00:51:32,064 --> 00:51:32,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now I know what it is.

740
00:51:33,104 --> 00:51:35,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, N Plus is coming out on Live Arcade later this year.

741
00:51:35,945 --> 00:51:36,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you be buying that?

742
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

743
00:51:37,285 --> 00:51:38,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, very cool.

744
00:51:38,686 --> 00:51:47,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, who knows how long it's going to get delayed because by this time we were supposed to see Castle Crashers but, you know, not that we're bitter or anything like the rest of you.

745
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:50,854
[SPEAKER_07]: The website of the week is thecastlevaniadungeons.com

746
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:29,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get there by going to castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com I will be, of course, posting a link in the chatroom, which I have actually already done once today.

747
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:35,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was posting links to images of the original Rondo of Blood.

748
00:52:35,578 --> 00:52:40,781
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go into the site, it has write-ups on every one of the games.

749
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:44,463
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the first thing that you see is actually a big screen print of...

750
00:52:45,382 --> 00:53:14,567
[SPEAKER_03]: The updated Rondo of Blood There's artwork, multimedia, emulation, fanfiction It's really cool I've actually been going on this site in upwards of 8 years now It really is the, I'd have to say, most in-depth Castlevania site ever And really, I can't say good enough about it It really is up there In fact, this site actually, if Dan told me right

751
00:53:15,094 --> 00:53:22,320
[SPEAKER_03]: inspired his site that he used to have back in the day, which was Neo Strider's Strider Zone, if you wouldn't ever remember that.

752
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:23,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerds.

753
00:53:24,082 --> 00:53:27,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I did his graphics for him, so it's partly my site too.

754
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:30,047
[SPEAKER_03]: But Casting the Dungeon is just fantastic.

755
00:53:30,447 --> 00:53:32,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Kudos to the folks that run it.

756
00:53:32,589 --> 00:53:36,973
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have been just keeping it awesome for years and so cool.

757
00:53:37,694 --> 00:53:38,074
[SPEAKER_03]: So go there.

758
00:53:38,894 --> 00:53:40,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I mean, after the show.

759
00:53:40,335 --> 00:53:43,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Why am I not surprised the Castlevania site made it for her website of the week?

760
00:53:43,456 --> 00:53:45,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was going to be History.com.

761
00:53:46,298 --> 00:53:48,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you just gave away what next week was likely to be.

762
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,020
[SPEAKER_03]: No, next week isn't History.com.

763
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I am completely shocked.

764
00:53:52,581 --> 00:53:53,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely shocked.

765
00:53:53,662 --> 00:53:54,222
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I thought.

766
00:53:54,922 --> 00:54:00,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, there are some other weird news that managed to leak out this week.

767
00:54:01,065 --> 00:54:07,869
[SPEAKER_05]: This website, DVD Empire, they were making big news about exiting the video game business.

768
00:54:08,424 --> 00:54:14,549
[SPEAKER_05]: and apparently gave their top 8 reasons why they are leaving the game business.

769
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:17,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, most people are like, who the fuck's DVD Empire?

770
00:54:17,912 --> 00:54:23,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the only way I've heard of them before is because, well, a couple reasons.

771
00:54:23,317 --> 00:54:28,401
[SPEAKER_05]: One, they're the legit side of adult DVD Empire, which, you know, is big on adult movies.

772
00:54:29,786 --> 00:54:32,148
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is, we actually sell to them.

773
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:35,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we did at one time, I guess, because now they're out of the business.

774
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:45,882
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just thought it was interesting, some of the reasons that they mentioned that they're leaving the game's business, because it actually doesn't make any sense.

775
00:54:47,524 --> 00:54:49,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think a lot of sites are covering this.

776
00:54:49,225 --> 00:54:50,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me just real quickly go down the list.

777
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:54,699
[SPEAKER_05]: 1.

778
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Video game industry does not care.

779
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,643
[SPEAKER_05]: The video game industry only cares about the mass emergence like Toys R Us, Walmart, Best Buy, etc.

780
00:54:59,683 --> 00:55:05,468
[SPEAKER_05]: They completely ignore the needs and wants of medium or small game retailers and blow with how they do it.

781
00:55:05,948 --> 00:55:07,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's sort of true.

782
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:12,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're not going to be able to bring in a retail kiosk or anything like that if you're a small guy.

783
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:14,594
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be doing a lot of business with them.

784
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:17,056
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't make money, they say.

785
00:55:18,017 --> 00:55:20,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is funny because I have a lot of customers that do make money.

786
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:20,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of it.

787
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:27,756
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not care whether or not we make money, but we continue to pay to sell video games.

788
00:55:28,276 --> 00:55:30,896
[SPEAKER_05]: It is impossible for us to make money selling video games.

789
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:34,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Video game manufacturers set the price using what they call MSRP.

790
00:55:35,117 --> 00:55:37,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's an example of the video gaming industry greed.

791
00:55:37,738 --> 00:55:40,539
[SPEAKER_05]: They set the retail price at $5 above product costs.

792
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:41,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy it for $54.99, sell it for $59.99.

793
00:55:41,979 --> 00:55:42,799
[SPEAKER_05]: That is completely untrue.

794
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:52,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Their price, which I happened to, after reading this, I looked it up, is way below that price.

795
00:55:52,930 --> 00:56:00,814
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I think they were, at least for us, buying 6%, or their discount was our cost plus 6%.

796
00:56:01,995 --> 00:56:05,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were actually paying 6% over what we paid for it.

797
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:11,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were still making tons of money on this stuff, and there's never that type of margins on stuff at all.

798
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what the fuck they're talking about there, and they can definitely make money off of that stuff.

799
00:56:16,397 --> 00:56:19,779
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also saying no price protections, games dropping price quickly.

800
00:56:20,299 --> 00:56:24,462
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys used to buy one piece of different things at a time.

801
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:26,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So they wouldn't have a large inventory.

802
00:56:26,643 --> 00:56:27,564
[SPEAKER_05]: That wouldn't even apply.

803
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:30,946
[SPEAKER_05]: No returns, that's all over the industry.

804
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:33,227
[SPEAKER_05]: They say distribution is dumb.

805
00:56:33,668 --> 00:56:35,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who their rep was, so that might be the case.

806
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:40,312
[SPEAKER_05]: They say basically that they get their product three days after street date.

807
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:43,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, unless they are a big chain company...

808
00:56:44,221 --> 00:56:50,705
[SPEAKER_05]: They won't get any product on street date because you have to be direct with the actual publishers in order to get stuff on street date.

809
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, they're just stupid.

810
00:56:53,527 --> 00:56:58,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And better suited for brick and mortar retailers, that might be true, but either way, they're just bitching and moaning.

811
00:56:58,911 --> 00:57:00,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So, good riddance.

812
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:13,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Travis Donovan from our own Saturday Night program here at Orange Lounge Radio says, I tried ordering from them back in 02 and it took three weeks to get my order and then it was wrong and then another month and a half to get what I ordered.

813
00:57:13,615 --> 00:57:14,936
[SPEAKER_07]: All their games are now 20% off.

814
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:18,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you were buying games and not porno, right, Travis?

815
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:27,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and, well, the other thing, too, they were talking about here, there's some updates at the bottom of their little bitch page here.

816
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:29,021
[SPEAKER_05]: They have three different updates.

817
00:57:29,181 --> 00:57:32,585
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them says, we knew about the low profit margins when developing our game sufficient.

818
00:57:32,605 --> 00:57:33,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Then why are you bitching?

819
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:36,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did they put up a bitch page in the first place?

820
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:38,172
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of unprofessional.

821
00:57:38,192 --> 00:57:38,673
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so retarded.

822
00:57:39,074 --> 00:57:42,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other one, people responded to our news with, well, your model sucked.

823
00:57:42,718 --> 00:57:44,621
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have sold used games and accessories.

824
00:57:47,234 --> 00:57:47,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way.

825
00:57:48,335 --> 00:57:53,299
[SPEAKER_05]: There are retailers and smaller guys that sell a lot more than you guys do.

826
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:59,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we were their only distributor, but if we were, they weren't buying anything.

827
00:57:59,283 --> 00:58:00,684
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't hardly buying anything.

828
00:58:02,085 --> 00:58:03,726
[SPEAKER_05]: They are just really whining.

829
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:05,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out of the business.

830
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:14,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one thing I'm sure will be successful, no matter how it's delivered to folks, would be a Katamari Damacy online game.

831
00:58:14,963 --> 00:58:15,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Catamari Damacy Online

832
00:58:40,592 --> 00:58:41,093
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

833
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:03,059
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

834
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:08,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we would like to take this opportunity to welcome your phone calls at this time by opening up our Skype line.

835
00:59:08,722 --> 00:59:11,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

836
00:59:11,964 --> 00:59:14,125
[SPEAKER_07]: That number is toll-free in the United States and Canada.

837
00:59:14,545 --> 00:59:18,447
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd rather, though, or if you're in another country, you should call us on Skype.

838
00:59:18,768 --> 00:59:20,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

839
00:59:20,969 --> 00:59:27,452
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get more detail by going to our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com, and clicking on Interact With Us.

840
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:32,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So while we wait for some phone calls, do you have any last-minute news, some real quick last-minute news, anyone?

841
00:59:32,657 --> 00:59:34,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, real quick.

842
00:59:35,019 --> 00:59:35,980
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple things.

843
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,543
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some stuff being developed for the PSP homebrew stuff.

844
00:59:40,063 --> 00:59:42,325
[SPEAKER_05]: One of these is the Legend of Zelda Quest for Link.

845
00:59:43,266 --> 00:59:47,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually it looks kind of cool, kind of resembles the Super Nintendo Zelda.

846
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:50,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to check that, PSP Updates has the link for you.

847
00:59:51,553 --> 00:59:56,357
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's also one that looks like a cross between Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Biohazard.

848
00:59:57,078 --> 01:00:01,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Biohazard 2 version 2.0 final has been released.

849
01:00:01,716 --> 01:00:03,957
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah, it looks exactly like Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

850
01:00:24,517 --> 01:00:26,759
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 1230 when I was over here.

851
01:00:34,959 --> 01:00:35,479
[SPEAKER_07]: should be said.

852
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:45,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I love all games, but their phone system, I don't know if it happens to you when you call in, but you hear yourself echoing, and it totally bugs.

853
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:47,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I agree.

854
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:50,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't hear anything they were saying, so it was tough.

855
01:00:50,684 --> 01:00:54,265
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't always been that way, because I've been on the show before, and I didn't have that.

856
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:56,906
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, is that all you wanted to say?

857
01:00:56,926 --> 01:00:57,486
[SPEAKER_07]: No, two more things.

858
01:00:57,506 --> 01:00:57,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what else?

859
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:01,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam and Max is great on GameTap.

860
01:01:01,084 --> 01:01:02,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been enjoying myself with it.

861
01:01:02,645 --> 01:01:06,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I freaking updated GameTap this week, meaning to play it, and then I got sucked into something else.

862
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:09,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I played one of those stupid arcade games.

863
01:01:09,868 --> 01:01:13,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that too, but you know, because GameTap has like 800 games on it.

864
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:20,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like you go there, I'm like, oh, I'm going to finally play Myst Online or Sam and Max, and then I'm like, holy shit, they put this game on there?

865
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:21,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I've totally got to play that game.

866
01:01:21,693 --> 01:01:24,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it was like Rainbow Islands or some crap.

867
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:25,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, ADD.

868
01:01:25,595 --> 01:01:25,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

869
01:01:25,855 --> 01:01:26,375
[SPEAKER_07]: You're ADD.

870
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:27,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there it is.

871
01:01:27,155 --> 01:01:28,256
[SPEAKER_07]: You have gamer ADD as well?

872
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:29,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

873
01:01:29,725 --> 01:01:32,047
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't finish Hitman, and that made me mad.

874
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:33,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to finish it, and it gave me mad.

875
01:01:35,168 --> 01:01:35,949
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is on your mind?

876
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:40,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I have to tell you about the Mario Kart 64 thing.

877
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:43,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to tell you why.

878
01:01:43,819 --> 01:01:45,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the save ghost thing?

879
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:52,721
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because the Wii, the emulator for the N64 doesn't realize that it's not an N64 before.

880
01:01:52,961 --> 01:01:55,602
[SPEAKER_10]: It's running on a Wii, so it's thinking it's on an N64.

881
01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:56,902
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what an emulator is.

882
01:01:57,322 --> 01:02:03,904
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's thinking that it's an N64 and it's thinking that it has an N64 pack in it.

883
01:02:04,724 --> 01:02:05,904
[SPEAKER_10]: It thinks it needs that.

884
01:02:06,511 --> 01:02:09,212
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs that, but in retrospect, it doesn't have it.

885
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:16,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of sort of was implying that when I said that in order to make it work, they would have to go and recode the game itself.

886
01:02:17,357 --> 01:02:19,698
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a lot more than just trying to emulate it correctly.

887
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:25,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're right, they would have to recode the game to instead of looking for the memory pack, look for the Wii's memory.

888
01:02:25,481 --> 01:02:29,483
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not something that's easily done with a 15-year-old... No, how old is that game?

889
01:02:29,503 --> 01:02:29,943
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 years old?

890
01:02:30,144 --> 01:02:30,944
[SPEAKER_07]: With a 10-year-old game.

891
01:02:32,646 --> 01:02:39,412
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that other emulated sites like Project, I'm not going to say the rest, but they got through that.

892
01:02:39,452 --> 01:02:42,095
[SPEAKER_10]: The Wii, it's built up emulation.

893
01:02:42,315 --> 01:02:44,697
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only going to pull what it thinks.

894
01:02:44,717 --> 01:02:48,200
[SPEAKER_10]: The save states on the cartridge will work fine on the Wii.

895
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:51,003
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just those cartridge games might not.

896
01:02:51,683 --> 01:02:52,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we shall see.

897
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,144
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I do want to say this, though.

898
01:02:54,184 --> 01:02:59,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I do agree that Nintendo definitely should use that patching feature to fix some of these things.

899
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not so much the ghost thing.

900
01:03:00,806 --> 01:03:02,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I could care less about that.

901
01:03:02,426 --> 01:03:06,947
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would just love to see them give little bonuses, especially the multiplayer.

902
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:11,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially with the old-ass 8-bit games like Mario Brothers.

903
01:03:11,328 --> 01:03:14,309
[SPEAKER_07]: How much more valuable would games like that be if we could play those online?

904
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:15,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

905
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:16,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Just one more second.

906
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:17,310
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

907
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:17,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

908
01:03:18,021 --> 01:03:21,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I thought the emulation was good on the N64.

909
01:03:22,104 --> 01:03:27,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, wouldn't you be pissed if you played Mario and it was off, like, one millisecond?

910
01:03:28,169 --> 01:03:28,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

911
01:03:29,771 --> 01:03:30,932
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, that's all I have to say.

912
01:03:31,212 --> 01:03:44,823
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I do want to say one other thing, though, about the emulation, is that one thing, you know, having the widescreen HD and everything, I noticed that the Xbox 360 is smart enough to put the vertical letterbox on my games when I'm playing something that's not widescreen, but the Nintendo Wii is not.

913
01:03:45,931 --> 01:03:48,812
[SPEAKER_07]: and I really wish it was and that is not a very hard fix.

914
01:03:49,113 --> 01:03:55,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I realize I could dig up the TV remote and switch it that way but it's so much easier when the system just does it automatically.

915
01:03:56,016 --> 01:03:57,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see Nintendo make that little patch.

916
01:03:58,457 --> 01:04:00,318
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right and that's it.

917
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:01,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to get another call.

918
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:02,279
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

919
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Raven Stolfen for your opinion as always.

920
01:04:07,281 --> 01:04:10,263
[SPEAKER_07]: He had his agenda tonight and he has one, two, three agenda.

921
01:04:10,303 --> 01:04:10,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Bravo.

922
01:04:10,883 --> 01:04:11,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

923
01:04:11,786 --> 01:04:16,148
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we welcome your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or the Skype line.

924
01:04:16,488 --> 01:04:17,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

925
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:17,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

926
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:19,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up?

927
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:21,470
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Rob D. Hi, the Rob D. How are you doing?

928
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:22,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Not too bad.

929
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:26,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, I'm a little bit sad, but it has nothing to do with anything other than the Super Bowl.

930
01:04:27,893 --> 01:04:29,394
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm from Chicago.

931
01:04:29,434 --> 01:04:34,516
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not too big on the Super Bowl here, but I understand it was a big thing for folks around Chicago.

932
01:04:34,576 --> 01:04:37,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I know one of our lesbians is from the immediate area.

933
01:04:38,103 --> 01:04:40,324
[SPEAKER_07]: I was rooting for the Bears simply because I was hoping they'd make another music video.

934
01:04:40,364 --> 01:04:41,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Bowl shuffle?

935
01:04:41,065 --> 01:04:41,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.

936
01:04:41,725 --> 01:04:44,566
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite line from that is probably, now I'm as smooth as a chocolate swirl.

937
01:04:44,586 --> 01:04:48,448
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to admit, and without getting too much further into sports, you have to admit that opening touchdown was hilarious.

938
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:08,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.

939
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:08,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Comedy Gold.

940
01:05:08,831 --> 01:05:10,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what's on your mind tonight, game-wise?

941
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:15,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, basically, I have to talk about the whole ghost-saving thing with a memory pack.

942
01:05:15,596 --> 01:05:16,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Popular topic tonight, yes.

943
01:05:16,777 --> 01:05:17,258
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

944
01:05:18,198 --> 01:05:22,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I disagree that it has to do with hacking the game itself or altering the game itself in any way.

945
01:05:22,602 --> 01:05:26,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the emulator could be programmed to emulate a control pack itself.

946
01:05:29,395 --> 01:05:44,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I suppose, I don't know, I guess maybe I'm just thinking, the reason why my brain goes there is I'm thinking maybe it's just simply the way the data is written, or you're talking about different types of memory, I don't know, my brain, for some reason I'm thinking in my mind, it has to be the game that's recoded.

947
01:05:44,305 --> 01:05:48,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I wish Nintendo would be more open, but you know, they're not going to tell us the specifics.

948
01:05:49,128 --> 01:05:55,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just figured since every PC emulator has figured out a way to get around save data, it would only take a little bit of ingenuity to get around it on the Wii.

949
01:05:55,492 --> 01:05:55,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I suppose.

950
01:05:55,853 --> 01:05:56,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I suppose.

951
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:01,153
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, the Wii is so locked down when it comes to hacking and all that stuff.

952
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:03,155
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be Nintendo who does it.

953
01:06:03,175 --> 01:06:05,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly don't think they care enough.

954
01:06:05,638 --> 01:06:08,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they just want to start cranking out more virtual console games for us to buy.

955
01:06:08,781 --> 01:06:13,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they want to get working on Pokemon Snap and whatever else on the 64 they're going to be bringing us.

956
01:06:14,507 --> 01:06:15,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Ocarina of Time, all that crap.

957
01:06:16,383 --> 01:06:18,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not a big deal for ghost data.

958
01:06:18,364 --> 01:06:20,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I never used it in the N64 version anyway.

959
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:24,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I didn't have a memory pack, so it's kind of a moot point to me.

960
01:06:24,187 --> 01:06:30,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh, well, that's too bad I can't save ghost data, but then again, I'm barely playing this as it is because I have such bad gamer ADD.

961
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:39,295
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing I'd like to comment on, though, is since Final Fantasy VI comes out this week for the Game Boy Advance, I think that's a great thing.

962
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:41,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Final Fantasy VI.

963
01:06:41,116 --> 01:06:42,757
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my favorite Final Fantasy game ever.

964
01:06:43,397 --> 01:06:44,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Terra's theme is...

965
01:06:45,182 --> 01:06:47,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite possibly my favorite piece of music from any game.

966
01:06:47,763 --> 01:06:51,045
[SPEAKER_07]: The opera is one of the best scenes in video games.

967
01:06:51,085 --> 01:06:53,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be the best.

968
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:54,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

969
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:55,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's a different thing.

970
01:06:55,487 --> 01:06:56,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about a different part of the game.

971
01:06:56,808 --> 01:07:00,370
[SPEAKER_07]: But the opera scene is possibly the best scene in video game history, period.

972
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:01,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Very fun.

973
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:08,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I went to the More Friends concert a couple years ago before E3 and they reenacted that thing, like they had the actual opera singers, just chills.

974
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:12,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though the rest of the concert had sound glitches galore, that part was phenomenal.

975
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:13,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Phenomenal.

976
01:07:15,472 --> 01:07:17,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Why haven't we seen a remake of Chrono Trigger?

977
01:07:19,515 --> 01:07:21,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they touch it on the PlayStation 1 at least?

978
01:07:21,697 --> 01:07:23,098
[SPEAKER_09]: They did, Final Fantasy Chronicle.

979
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:27,622
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's kind of like, why doesn't Nintendo do a new Kid Icarus?

980
01:07:28,283 --> 01:07:36,130
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like, it squares little franchises that they're just kind of waiting for the right time on, I suppose, to really wow us.

981
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:37,351
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that is kind of interesting.

982
01:07:37,411 --> 01:07:39,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Why haven't we seen a Chrono Trigger type game on the DS?

983
01:07:39,212 --> 01:07:42,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if the other part of it isn't Toriyama's stake in it.

984
01:07:43,314 --> 01:07:43,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

985
01:07:43,974 --> 01:07:51,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Toriyama is a really big name in art in Japan, so it could possibly be his own stake in it.

986
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:54,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but what other RPG could get me to care about an anthropomorphic frog?

987
01:07:55,978 --> 01:07:56,198
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

988
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they'll add one in Final Fantasy VI.

989
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:00,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Battletoads, hey.

990
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,520
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to Battletoads vs. Double Dragon?

991
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Battletoads was too fucking hard.

992
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:06,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone gave up on it.

993
01:08:07,762 --> 01:08:11,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it took me forever to get through, but I did actually beat that game, but that's a different story altogether.

994
01:08:11,543 --> 01:08:12,363
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I had to say, so

995
01:08:12,819 --> 01:08:14,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll leave you to the rest of the show.

996
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,000
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

997
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much for your insight, Rob D. We've been enjoying your chat comments tonight.

998
01:08:18,601 --> 01:08:18,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

999
01:08:18,982 --> 01:08:19,682
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, take care, buddy.

1000
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:20,462
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

1001
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:20,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1002
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:24,084
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go to another call right here on the line.

1003
01:08:24,124 --> 01:08:25,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1004
01:08:25,284 --> 01:08:25,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1005
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:27,445
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Brad from PodCulture.

1006
01:08:27,545 --> 01:08:29,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Brad from PodCulture.

1007
01:08:29,126 --> 01:08:29,826
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, buddy?

1008
01:08:30,586 --> 01:08:33,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm short and I'm fat and I'm going bald, but other than that, okay.

1009
01:08:34,548 --> 01:08:36,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, real life sucks, but that's okay.

1010
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:37,409
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we have the Internet.

1011
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:39,590
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1012
01:08:40,222 --> 01:08:42,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob's not as bad as me.

1013
01:08:42,584 --> 01:08:44,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got like ten people waiting at the queue.

1014
01:08:59,464 --> 01:09:00,065
[SPEAKER_06]: That's no big thing.

1015
01:09:00,085 --> 01:09:03,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more interested in playing with the me's more than anything else.

1016
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:04,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just send you my doctor.

1017
01:09:04,728 --> 01:09:07,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I will send you the goat say me somebody made me.

1018
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:07,890
[SPEAKER_07]: It's disgusting.

1019
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:08,410
[SPEAKER_07]: It's brilliant.

1020
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Lord.

1021
01:09:09,231 --> 01:09:11,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Michael Jackson and the doctor.

1022
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:13,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was SSJ100 Matt made it.

1023
01:09:13,874 --> 01:09:14,994
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a goat say me.

1024
01:09:15,114 --> 01:09:15,795
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious.

1025
01:09:16,215 --> 01:09:17,696
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so wrong on so many levels.

1026
01:09:17,716 --> 01:09:18,236
[SPEAKER_06]: But funny.

1027
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:21,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what else is on your mind regarding the we?

1028
01:09:22,307 --> 01:09:26,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I got the Mario Kart 64, downloaded that today.

1029
01:09:26,928 --> 01:09:34,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only that, the problem with the ghost data, I was having problems with plugging in my GameCube controller and using it.

1030
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:39,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, because those games are optimized for the Wii Classic controller.

1031
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:41,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't tried the GameCube controller.

1032
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:42,371
[SPEAKER_07]: What were the problems you were having?

1033
01:09:43,532 --> 01:09:45,352
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the A button wouldn't work.

1034
01:09:47,533 --> 01:09:48,613
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it's not the controller.

1035
01:09:48,653 --> 01:09:49,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I played that...

1036
01:09:50,754 --> 01:09:51,335
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1037
01:10:10,523 --> 01:10:12,343
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't like the Wii Classic controller?

1038
01:10:12,843 --> 01:10:13,023
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1039
01:10:13,224 --> 01:10:14,324
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it about it you don't like?

1040
01:10:15,124 --> 01:10:19,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'm being used to the Xbox controller or PlayStation.

1041
01:10:19,745 --> 01:10:21,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the way that it fits in the hands.

1042
01:10:21,825 --> 01:10:22,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

1043
01:10:22,825 --> 01:10:28,286
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing that weirds me out about the controller is all the buttons on the top of it.

1044
01:10:28,786 --> 01:10:33,327
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an L button, an R button, and then a little Z, and these other little nubs on it.

1045
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:34,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's too many buttons.

1046
01:10:35,288 --> 01:10:37,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it me, or is the A and B buttons reversed?

1047
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:39,802
[SPEAKER_06]: from what they normally would be on the controller.

1048
01:10:39,842 --> 01:10:45,823
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think they're right, but sometimes if you play a lot of Japanese games, they're usually backwards, and so that can kind of mess with you.

1049
01:10:46,303 --> 01:10:47,804
[SPEAKER_07]: It just seems like it's in a weird place.

1050
01:10:47,964 --> 01:10:49,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1051
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:50,345
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what else was that?

1052
01:10:50,465 --> 01:10:54,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Nintendo Maniac64 says a classic controller is needed for Super Nintendo games.

1053
01:10:55,086 --> 01:10:57,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd agree with that, because the GameCube had that funky layout for the buttons.

1054
01:10:57,907 --> 01:10:58,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I beg to differ.

1055
01:10:58,987 --> 01:11:01,808
[SPEAKER_07]: You use the GameCube controller on Super Nintendo games?

1056
01:11:01,928 --> 01:11:02,548
[SPEAKER_03]: The HoriPad.

1057
01:11:04,571 --> 01:11:08,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Hori made a GameCube controller that was in the Super Nintendo.

1058
01:11:08,992 --> 01:11:11,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so you're not really using a GameCube controller.

1059
01:11:11,532 --> 01:11:11,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

1060
01:11:12,072 --> 01:11:16,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't have a classic controller, you've still got another way to do it.

1061
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:18,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I didn't even think about a third-party GameCube controller.

1062
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:20,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that the Hori pads came out in the U.S.

1063
01:11:20,454 --> 01:11:21,274
[SPEAKER_03]: at major retailers.

1064
01:11:21,714 --> 01:11:22,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there you go.

1065
01:11:24,595 --> 01:11:25,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Good insight, DarkSakura.

1066
01:11:25,995 --> 01:11:26,315
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1067
01:11:27,335 --> 01:11:29,956
[SPEAKER_07]: So what other games have you been playing on your Wii, Brad?

1068
01:11:29,976 --> 01:11:30,236
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1069
01:11:30,663 --> 01:11:32,686
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1070
01:11:47,046 --> 01:11:47,326
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1071
01:11:47,406 --> 01:11:50,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go get you a Wii card if you promise me the first thing you download is R-Type.

1072
01:11:51,309 --> 01:11:51,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.

1073
01:11:51,729 --> 01:11:53,630
[SPEAKER_06]: You send me a Wii card, I'll download anything you want.

1074
01:11:53,671 --> 01:11:57,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait until after I make my next school payment.

1075
01:11:58,734 --> 01:11:59,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1076
01:11:59,414 --> 01:12:00,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this, guys.

1077
01:12:00,895 --> 01:12:01,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Call in tonight.

1078
01:12:01,656 --> 01:12:03,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's giving away free Wii points.

1079
01:12:04,077 --> 01:12:05,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Only to my fellow Whovian.

1080
01:12:06,379 --> 01:12:06,739
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1081
01:12:09,421 --> 01:12:10,221
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a contest.

1082
01:12:10,262 --> 01:12:12,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Say something nice about Doctor Who win Wii points.

1083
01:12:13,092 --> 01:12:15,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Send those emails to mailbag at orangefleshradio.com.

1084
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:19,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send Wii points to whoever gets me a David Tennant signature.

1085
01:12:20,138 --> 01:12:20,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there you go.

1086
01:12:20,979 --> 01:12:23,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, actually, I could just do that with an envelope, but still.

1087
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:24,041
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1088
01:12:25,263 --> 01:12:26,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Zappy in our chat says, I love Doctor Who.

1089
01:12:26,944 --> 01:12:27,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me.

1090
01:12:27,745 --> 01:12:28,005
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1091
01:12:28,245 --> 01:12:29,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad, anything else on your mind tonight?

1092
01:12:30,327 --> 01:12:32,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the DOA movie actually doesn't suck.

1093
01:12:33,309 --> 01:12:33,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1094
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:36,012
[SPEAKER_07]: See, all I've heard is really negative things about it.

1095
01:12:36,712 --> 01:12:40,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I know you reviewed it on your own program, but in a nutshell, what were your thoughts on it?

1096
01:12:41,886 --> 01:12:43,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It's complete popcorn.

1097
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:50,049
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, there's not a whole lot of, I mean, it's all substance, but are all... All style, no substance?

1098
01:12:50,109 --> 01:12:50,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1099
01:12:50,509 --> 01:12:50,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1100
01:12:51,149 --> 01:12:55,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it's a fun summer movie kind of thing.

1101
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:58,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just fun.

1102
01:12:58,892 --> 01:13:08,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not... So, it's like, it's one of those movies where, like, turn your brain off for two hours and just kind of be a mindless zombie and it's not so bad?

1103
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:08,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1104
01:13:09,155 --> 01:13:09,775
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's cool.

1105
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:11,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you think it bypassed theaters?

1106
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:18,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know because I've paid ten bucks to see movies that are ten times worse than that.

1107
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:20,063
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1108
01:13:20,123 --> 01:13:21,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I did pay to see Lady in the Water.

1109
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:30,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have the life, or is it, I'm sorry, is it true in Dead or Alive movie that they have like life bars and the announcer in it?

1110
01:13:31,387 --> 01:13:31,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1111
01:13:31,827 --> 01:13:33,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that, that sounds cheesy.

1112
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:34,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it cheesy?

1113
01:13:35,148 --> 01:13:37,209
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very cheesy in some places, yeah.

1114
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:45,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well, I suppose you don't go see a Dead or Alive movie expecting Oscar caliber, Judi Dench acting in it type content.

1115
01:13:46,044 --> 01:13:48,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Although it would be kind of funny if Judi Dench was in Dead or Alive, don't you think?

1116
01:13:51,267 --> 01:13:51,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

1117
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:52,128
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1118
01:13:53,288 --> 01:13:53,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Not funny.

1119
01:13:55,129 --> 01:13:55,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1120
01:13:56,330 --> 01:14:00,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, I hope they go to your program and check out the full review of Dead or Alive.

1121
01:14:01,453 --> 01:14:01,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1122
01:14:02,053 --> 01:14:03,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well Brad, thanks so much for calling in tonight.

1123
01:14:03,694 --> 01:14:05,515
[SPEAKER_07]: We gotta go to another call, but take care buddy, okay?

1124
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:06,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Later on, man.

1125
01:14:06,635 --> 01:14:06,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1126
01:14:07,456 --> 01:14:07,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace.

1127
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:12,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, little mini movie review here on Orange Launch Radio.

1128
01:14:12,076 --> 01:14:13,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to one more call.

1129
01:14:13,717 --> 01:14:14,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1130
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:15,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1131
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:17,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Shadow Next Gen in chat.

1132
01:14:18,139 --> 01:14:19,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Shadow Next Gen in chat.

1133
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,280
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1134
01:14:22,821 --> 01:14:27,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if you guys talked about this earlier as I was late to the show because of the Super Bowl.

1135
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:30,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, a lot of people have that excuse tonight, but try me.

1136
01:14:30,224 --> 01:14:30,525
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1137
01:14:31,545 --> 01:14:38,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have any idea about what Konami's quote-unquote earth-shattering news tomorrow is going to be?

1138
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:40,717
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1139
01:14:40,878 --> 01:14:46,029
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't bring this up, but I had read somewhere that they have earth-shattering news coming on Monday.

1140
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:47,373
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on their own website.

1141
01:14:47,393 --> 01:14:48,615
[SPEAKER_01]: They're advertising tomorrow.

1142
01:14:48,676 --> 01:14:49,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth-shattering news.

1143
01:14:50,314 --> 01:14:54,895
[SPEAKER_07]: and I saw that get picked up on Kotaku or Destructoid or one of those sites.

1144
01:14:55,876 --> 01:14:57,916
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because they didn't tell us what it is on Thursday.

1145
01:14:57,976 --> 01:15:06,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I can guarantee you, we talked earlier in the show about we weren't allowed to say some things for some time, but I can guarantee you everything that we were allowed to say has been said now.

1146
01:15:06,459 --> 01:15:08,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the earth-shattering news.

1147
01:15:08,579 --> 01:15:11,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming soon.

1148
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:14,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling.

1149
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably about one of the games we didn't see.

1150
01:15:17,032 --> 01:15:19,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, where was the Metal Gear Solid 4 info?

1151
01:15:19,352 --> 01:15:20,173
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe that's it.

1152
01:15:20,253 --> 01:15:27,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's the Metal Gear Solid release date because don't you remember her saying something like, well, we want to give you the release date, but can we do that yet?

1153
01:15:28,235 --> 01:15:28,395
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

1154
01:15:28,795 --> 01:15:30,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, didn't she kind of do that kind of thing?

1155
01:15:30,615 --> 01:15:32,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, wasn't that how she was teasing the release date?

1156
01:15:32,776 --> 01:15:33,256
[SPEAKER_07]: She's just...

1157
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:36,324
[SPEAKER_07]: or was she just smoking a bowl?

1158
01:15:36,484 --> 01:15:42,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't she remind you just a little bit of what's-her-name from Nintendo, the Perrin Kaplan or whatever?

1159
01:15:42,588 --> 01:15:42,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1160
01:15:42,968 --> 01:15:49,312
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, I would say if it's that earth-shattering, it's the Metal Gear Solid 4 release date, new trailer, something like that.

1161
01:15:49,652 --> 01:15:52,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that missed Konami Gamers Day for whatever reason.

1162
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:58,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know I was reading a lot of people are thinking it's maybe Konami's confirmation of MGS4 and the 360s.

1163
01:16:01,718 --> 01:16:10,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling if that's going to happen, it's going to be a window where it's going to be on the PS3 for six months, and then it'll come out on the 360.

1164
01:16:12,287 --> 01:16:14,389
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be like Virtua Fighter and just be Blade.

1165
01:16:14,829 --> 01:16:18,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's essentially what I'm getting at, is that it might be one of those things.

1166
01:16:18,732 --> 01:16:22,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'll tell you what, Sony needs that so bad right now.

1167
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:28,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can kind of tell that Konami's really back in the PSP more than almost anyone else.

1168
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami is doing what they can for Sony.

1169
01:16:31,561 --> 01:16:36,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, they still are in the business of making money, but I have a feeling they're going to give at least a window.

1170
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:38,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not expect that to be tomorrow's news.

1171
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:39,847
[SPEAKER_07]: But I could be wrong.

1172
01:16:40,088 --> 01:16:40,648
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be it.

1173
01:16:41,028 --> 01:16:41,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I see what you did there.

1174
01:16:41,789 --> 01:16:41,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny.

1175
01:17:10,601 --> 01:17:12,822
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you hope it is, Shadow Next Gen?

1176
01:17:14,443 --> 01:17:17,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, like I said, I'd like to see Metal Gear on the 360.

1177
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:21,366
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably be for me.

1178
01:17:21,607 --> 01:17:23,868
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, one less reason for me to shell out $600.

1179
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:30,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know, yeah, it would be bad news for Sony if that is what they announce tomorrow.

1180
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:33,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think Sony ought to just throw in the towel at that point?

1181
01:17:33,252 --> 01:17:36,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what can Sony do if they're about to lose Metal Gear Solid to the 360?

1182
01:17:39,427 --> 01:17:40,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I really couldn't tell you.

1183
01:17:40,707 --> 01:17:44,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for one thing, they can start listening to their community like Microsoft does.

1184
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:45,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, good idea.

1185
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:50,875
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like they keep telling us what we want instead of listening to what we want.

1186
01:17:51,516 --> 01:17:52,196
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

1187
01:17:52,276 --> 01:17:54,758
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have anything quite like Major Nelson.

1188
01:17:55,419 --> 01:17:56,560
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to give that to Microsoft.

1189
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:00,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft is by no means perfect, but at least they do have their outlet with their community.

1190
01:18:00,903 --> 01:18:04,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've got to admit, though, Nintendo kind of doesn't really listen to people either, but somehow they get away with it.

1191
01:18:05,942 --> 01:18:09,303
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they don't, but I think they do a little bit better.

1192
01:18:09,423 --> 01:18:11,604
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they could do better in that area as well.

1193
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:18,786
[SPEAKER_07]: We seem to forgive Nintendo because they kind of at least deliver a little more than Sony seems to have been recently, I think is what it comes down to.

1194
01:18:19,966 --> 01:18:25,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think, personally, I think the reason why Sony has gotten so much far over the past year is just their PR.

1195
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:29,749
[SPEAKER_01]: If they wouldn't have said half of their stupid comments, they'd probably be in a much better position right now.

1196
01:18:29,949 --> 01:18:30,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I would agree with you there.

1197
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:35,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the time when people will buy a PS3 even if there are no games for it.

1198
01:18:36,469 --> 01:18:37,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

1199
01:18:37,711 --> 01:18:42,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, we will see what that announcement is and we'll talk about it next week.

1200
01:18:42,098 --> 01:18:46,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Shadow Next Gen, I'm hoping you'll call us back next week and let us know about the news, whatever it is.

1201
01:18:47,846 --> 01:18:48,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, alright.

1202
01:18:48,507 --> 01:18:49,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good, guys.

1203
01:18:49,168 --> 01:18:49,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, take care, buddy.

1204
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:50,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

1205
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:51,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you too.

1206
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:52,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1207
01:18:53,291 --> 01:18:54,832
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.

1208
01:18:54,852 --> 01:18:56,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much to all our people calling in.

1209
01:18:56,513 --> 01:18:58,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And I apologize if we didn't get to your call.

1210
01:18:58,053 --> 01:18:59,834
[SPEAKER_07]: We were getting hammered a lot there towards the end.

1211
01:18:59,874 --> 01:19:01,775
[SPEAKER_07]: But we just got to keep things moving.

1212
01:19:01,815 --> 01:19:02,876
[SPEAKER_07]: We're running a little late tonight.

1213
01:19:02,956 --> 01:19:07,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show.

1214
01:19:07,138 --> 01:19:08,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any more last-minute stories, guys?

1215
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:09,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1216
01:19:09,419 --> 01:19:09,659
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1217
01:19:09,699 --> 01:19:10,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Loki.

1218
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:11,079
[SPEAKER_05]: A few things.

1219
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,021
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a brand-new wipeout.

1220
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:14,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1221
01:19:14,441 --> 01:19:15,001
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a surprise.

1222
01:19:15,281 --> 01:19:17,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Brand-new wipeout coming to the PS3 and PSP.

1223
01:19:19,649 --> 01:19:48,973
[SPEAKER_05]: and actually looks pretty good they have some screenshots up on that you know looks very similar to the other Wipeout games apparently Microsoft is bringing Project Silphid over here for Square Enix and they're going to be publishing it stateside so that's kind of cool I'm very much looking forward to that one so we'll see the next gen shooter on 360 soon rumors are that according to Famitsu Resident Evil 5 is delayed to 2008 I definitely believe that um

1224
01:19:50,014 --> 01:19:56,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, another rumor here, and this apparently was actually coming from, I want to say Bungie.

1225
01:19:57,162 --> 01:19:59,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually it was from their last Bungie update.

1226
01:19:59,805 --> 01:20:04,249
[SPEAKER_05]: They were saying that you'll be able to modify the gravity in, I believe, multiplayer games.

1227
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:08,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can reduce the gravity to 50% and jump even further.

1228
01:20:08,494 --> 01:20:11,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray for low gravity games, you all know that's coming.

1229
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:14,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I give some quick chatroom comments to the last phone call here?

1230
01:20:15,271 --> 01:20:18,352
[SPEAKER_07]: NM64 says, Sky, I think Nintendo surprised their fans.

1231
01:20:18,492 --> 01:20:20,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony tells fans what they want.

1232
01:20:20,552 --> 01:20:26,134
[SPEAKER_07]: TheRobD says, That's because Nintendo doesn't act like arrogant jerks and piss all over our memories when they don't listen to us.

1233
01:20:26,794 --> 01:20:29,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackboy says, Nintendo totally doesn't listen to the consumers.

1234
01:20:30,635 --> 01:20:31,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1235
01:20:31,295 --> 01:20:34,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Hitstun says, Konami announces Boktai game for PS3.

1236
01:20:34,556 --> 01:20:35,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah!

1237
01:20:36,156 --> 01:20:38,037
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to drag your PS3 out into the sun.

1238
01:20:39,954 --> 01:20:45,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Bandit says, Breaking news, Konami's tears can cure cancer, if only it was able to cry.

1239
01:20:47,097 --> 01:20:47,677
[SPEAKER_07]: How random.

1240
01:20:48,318 --> 01:20:50,499
[SPEAKER_05]: How ripped off from the Chuck Norris.

1241
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:51,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I get it, I get it.

1242
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:58,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, there was also another rumored list of titles coming out for the Wii.

1243
01:20:59,303 --> 01:21:04,345
[SPEAKER_05]: This is supposedly from the new GamePro issue, the March issue.

1244
01:21:05,563 --> 01:21:09,665
[SPEAKER_05]: On the list, we have 100 Bullets, which is supposed to hit in the fall.

1245
01:21:10,745 --> 01:21:13,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Alive, which is being done by Ubisoft.

1246
01:21:13,586 --> 01:21:17,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, that's that one girl game thing that's supposed to make you cry and stuff.

1247
01:21:18,388 --> 01:21:18,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

1248
01:21:19,088 --> 01:21:19,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

1249
01:21:19,949 --> 01:21:20,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that.

1250
01:21:21,701 --> 01:21:51,325
[SPEAKER_05]: The Devil, a new Devil Kings game, which is very similar, it's Capcom's, uh, kind of Dying Sea Warriors type of game, a new Digimon game, uh, DK Bongo Blast, I guess is now coming out for the Wii, uh, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, not a big surprise, uh, Iron Man, the movie game coming out in 2008, Kirby, uh, new Kirby game 2007, I guess fall, Legend of the Dragon, I know Legend of the Dragon is coming out, um, Lost, they're supposed to be doing a game this year on that, um,

1251
01:21:53,039 --> 01:22:18,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Ratatouille I know that's coming out and that's actually not fall like listed on here Mario Kart for the Wii Pilot Wings for the Wii I don't believe that but I guess we'll see a new Wii shooting game and some new Wii Sports Wii Motorsports and they're going to have that airplane game that was shown to E3 Wii Music which is supposed to come in October TNA Impact

1252
01:22:20,413 --> 01:22:29,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Jawa, which I have no idea what that is, Space Station Tycoon, Dance Factory, Animal Crossing, Right Over the River, which actually looks pretty awesome.

1253
01:22:29,918 --> 01:22:32,039
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also coming out in the DS, and Sadness.

1254
01:22:34,061 --> 01:22:34,681
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1255
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's still on the Castlevania kick and now she's trying to get me into it too.

1256
01:22:43,104 --> 01:22:47,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I found a YouTube thing where someone has uploaded apparently the entire run of the game.

1257
01:22:47,528 --> 01:22:52,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And real quick, because I know this makes for awesome radio, I wanted to show you, Rob, a game I liked.

1258
01:22:52,332 --> 01:22:53,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you like Burnout.

1259
01:22:53,914 --> 01:22:55,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is another game, Flatout.

1260
01:22:55,896 --> 01:23:00,400
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the first screenshots for Flatout Ultimate Carnage on Xbox side.

1261
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:05,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought you might want to check this out because it looks very similar to Burnout.

1262
01:23:05,817 --> 01:23:07,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks very good.

1263
01:23:07,077 --> 01:23:08,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that's very pretty.

1264
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Burnout, but you can launch your driver through the windshield.

1265
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,500
[SPEAKER_03]: That is great.

1266
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:13,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to so play that.

1267
01:23:13,721 --> 01:23:14,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray.

1268
01:23:14,461 --> 01:23:17,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1269
01:23:17,923 --> 01:23:20,324
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, any other last minute news, Loki, DarkSakura, anyone?

1270
01:23:20,825 --> 01:23:22,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Rondo of Blood is the best.

1271
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:22,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1272
01:23:23,286 --> 01:23:23,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1273
01:23:23,746 --> 01:23:24,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I never knew.

1274
01:23:24,286 --> 01:23:25,267
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1275
01:23:26,178 --> 01:23:29,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that means we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
