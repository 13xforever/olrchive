6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,840
All right, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,120
We're taping live on February the 4th of 2007.

00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,760
Hey, if you want to join us for a live taping sometime, it's Sunday nights, 6 o'clock pacific,

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,760
www.orangeloungeradio.com.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,320
And yes, we know there's a big football game that just wrapped up and folks are probably

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,740
still at their parties, but here we are because we're loyal to the show.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,120
We love you guys and we love all of you that are in chat right now, even though there is

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,460
still that football game, post-game stuff going on and whatever show is on after it

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,560
this year and all that stuff going on.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,680
So thank you guys for being loyal and tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,640
Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,440
Who's starting us off in the next segment here?

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:08,160
Well apparently there's news that Sony was basically saying, a spokesman from Sony, Dave,

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,620
his name sounds like Cracker, Craker, I guess.

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,700
He was quoted, they were talking about the whole, you know, format wars and stuff and

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,720
talking about, you know, PlayStation 3 versus 360 and stuff.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,880
And then one of the things that they were talking about also was the Nintendo Wii and

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,160
saying that it wasn't even in the same category as PlayStation 3.

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,900
In fact, the Wii could be considered as an impulse buy more than anything else, which

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,320
everyone was like, oh my God, you know, that's so crazy that he would say that, but I don't

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,680
really think that's a, you know, okay, it is an impulse buy.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
It's cheaper than, you know.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,640
They're talking shit about the competition, oh noes, everybody does that.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,960
They're calling you, at least people are buying it.

30
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Impulse buy or not, huh?

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Exactly.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
All right.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,120
All right, so what do you think, Dark Soccer, is the Wii an impulse buy, is this a fair

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
statement to make?

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,640
I mean, I guess I've known some casual gamers who after playing Wii Tennis are like, I've

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,120
got to get one of those.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Is the Wii an impulse buy?

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,080
Well, tell me what average person just happens to have, you know, 350 bucks lying around.

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,080
You know, usually we have things to pay, like bills, or that's a car payment, you know.

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,320
Well, somehow the three of us manage it.

41
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,440
Well, yeah, but we also, you know, if we were responsible about it, planned out that purchase,

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
right?

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,240
Right, and I did not budget a PlayStation 3, so I didn't buy them.

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,160
We budgeted our PlayStation 3, we budgeted our Wii.

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,080
I budgeted the Wii, but I did not budget a PlayStation 3, which is why I don't have one.

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,580
I had to have mine three days early, so.

47
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,480
And JV Mon in our chat room comes back with the classic, your mom is an impulse buy.

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,000
That was pretty funny.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's why I said JV Mon.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,160
Last night!

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,520
Anyhow, and the Rob D says, that's what happens when it's at a lower price than $599 US dollars.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
It's a little easier to be in.

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,200
And it has more than 15 games.

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,480
Well, I wouldn't go as far as to call it an impulse buy, but it is something that's easier

55
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
to budget in.

56
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,960
Okay, but be honest, though, and this is only fair, since, you know, we rip on Sony a lot,

57
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,480
let me give it, you know, be fair here, uh, Nintendo, Wii, what's up with the Wii Connect

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
24 thing?

59
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,640
Because it obviously is not updating my firmware, it's not downloading new content for me, all

60
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,960
it's doing is sending me messages that I can download some more content.

61
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,560
Fucking, where is this automatic downloading shit?

62
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,320
It's there for the purpose of illuminating your living room in a blue glow.

63
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,000
Nintendo does not like to come out swinging with their stuff, haven't you noticed this

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
about them?

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,240
They don't like to reveal all the secrets of their consoles, like look at what happened

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
with the DS.

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,260
No one knew that thing would have voice thing over the internet or even have internet play

68
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,260
at all.

69
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,320
I mean, it was kind of hinted at, but never was that announced.

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,920
But Nintendo, for whatever reason, chooses to roll this out slowly.

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,200
Xbox 360, they come out swinging.

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,120
They lay their cock out on the table and say, thwack, here you go, it's all right here.

73
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,600
I mean, that's really a fundamental difference between like Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo

74
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,400
is the way they kind of...

75
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Even Sony, their online network, there's nothing on there!

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Give me something to buy!

77
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Landings?

78
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Gran Turismo?

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,800
Gran Turismo's free, okay, but there's still nothing to buy in there, there's no new demos.

80
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,080
There's PSP download games, that's completely useless, make the PSP download that shit!

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,240
Why do I have to have a PlayStation 3 to download this crap?

82
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,240
I mean, the PSP is capable of downloading this stuff too, you know, off the internet,

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
or if it's going to take too long to do that, download it on your PC!

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,720
That should be able to be done.

85
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,680
I mean, you'd probably sell some more of those virtual, you know, those emulated PlayStation

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,600
1 games if you did it that way, instead of having this stuff clutter the PlayStation

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,240
store, because there's nothing on there right now, and one game a month is bullshit, because

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,400
their games aren't that great to begin with.

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,920
I don't know, it's just really disappointing, at least fucking Xbox Live gets it, you know,

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,720
there's more stuff on there every week, you know, whether it be crap or not, at least

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,200
there's fucking demos on there, I can say, you know, oh, new demos, can't say the same

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,640
about PlayStation 3, I can certainly not say the same about the Wii, because there's nothing

93
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
on there!

94
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Nothing!

95
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,560
And only one game- Old games?

96
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,400
One game supports Wii Connect 24, and that's Elibits, and to be honest, I haven't gotten

97
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,260
shit from Elibits, you know, on the Wii Connect 24.

98
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,680
Would you like me to send you an Elibit picture, for use in Elibits?

99
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,040
I can do this for you, so you'll stop being such a bitch.

100
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
No, I don't.

101
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,200
But, the whole thing, it's just, you know, I thought that this would eliminate the fact

102
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,040
of me having to wait to download these updates, or, you know, whatever, it's just, they're

103
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,600
not using this shit.

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,800
Going back to a very dirty comment I made earlier, Rama says, Xbox 360's cock puts a

105
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
consumer's eye out.

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,200
DarkTetsUya says, Rob just likes to say cock.

107
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Who doesn't?

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Who doesn't?

109
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Do you like to say other things?

110
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,880
I like to say all dirty words, I like to say all types of dirty words.

111
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Who doesn't?

112
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,400
Well, even though we saw that Sony was being cocky in that last story, get it?

113
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,920
We have Nintendo accepting an award.

114
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:22,080
The Wii and WarioWare won an International Toy Fair award, that's pretty cool, except

115
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,600
when they said WarioWare won, they spelled it W-E-A-R.

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Well anyway, they won this International Toy Fair award, and they chose the Wii because,

117
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,280
quote, encourages playing PC games in groups instead of alone, even though it's not really

118
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
a PC game.

119
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,840
Well, that's a whole other story.

120
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,120
Also, quote, the product not only appeals to player types with an affinity to PCs, but

121
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,640
also to new age groups, making it sound like I'm going to, like, you know, take herbs.

122
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,720
They're talking out of their ass.

123
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,960
I think it's just these folks, you know, they don't really deal with gaming every day, so

124
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,760
it's, you know, they're used to giving awards to, like, Tickle Me Elmo, so I think that's

125
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,720
kind of the, what makes this newsworthy is that the Wii has kind of jumped that boundary

126
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,600
as becoming recognition as a toy, in general, and not just a gaming system.

127
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,040
Kind of interesting, I don't know.

128
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,720
I still don't think they get it, but I think this is pretty cool information, though.

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,640
Atari Europe is announcing a Godzilla game for the Wii.

130
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,400
And I'm sorry for the Wii, the DS, and the PSP.

131
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,280
It's called Godzilla Unleashed, and it's supposed to be a non-linear game featuring everybody's

132
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,760
favorite big green lizard, which, by the way, Godzilla is female.

133
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,400
Stop saying that she's a he.

134
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,880
So basically, you go around bashing stuff, kicking it, clawing it, stomping it, throwing

135
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,080
poo at it, I don't know, but you go through major cities worldwide and are aiming for

136
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,440
the title of king of all monsters.

137
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,880
She'd be queen, Godzilla's female.

138
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
She laid eggs.

139
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Sorry.

140
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:11,000
Anyway, but it's a game that you basically work the storyline as you progress.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,040
I think that's pretty cool, very dynamic, especially given that you're using the Wii

142
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
controller for it.

143
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,160
Well, I'm glad to see rampages coming out over there.

144
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,800
That was another thought I had, but I'm hoping that we get, like, Mothra and, you know, Gamera.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm glad to learn that we will have an accurate reenactment of a woman during her time of

146
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,360
the month on a console.

147
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
You see these bills?

148
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Yes.

149
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Ow.

150
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,420
It does explain why she constantly, you know, probably doesn't know where she's at because

151
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,560
she does it in bad directions, you know, oh, I fucking thought this was, like, the middle

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,120
of the ocean, but shit, it's Japan.

153
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
Well, goddammit, I'm pissed now.

154
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,520
I'm going to blow things up with fire.

155
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,800
Actually, no, I think the second Godzilla is male.

156
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,880
I would be shocked if Jamie comes back next week.

157
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Of course, someone's got to keep us in line, yes, Jamie?

158
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Am I getting the finger?

159
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Oh.

160
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
No, Matt was getting the finger.

161
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,760
Usually when it's silent, I'm getting the finger.

162
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,160
Wouldn't moths like to fly up in the space and fly into the sun because moths are, you

163
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
know, attracted to fire?

164
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Moths are stupid.

165
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,960
That's a dumb, why the hell would they create a moth, you know, monster anyways?

166
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,200
That's the dumbest thing ever.

167
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,400
But, but, but, but, but Gamera was cool.

168
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,800
Gamera is really neat.

169
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Flying turtle.

170
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,320
The last time I played a Godzilla game was the old ass NES game that they had with you.

171
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,160
Super NES game was fucking awesome.

172
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
And I played...

173
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Or was it NES?

174
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I don't remember.

175
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,840
It was a King of Monsters game, which wasn't really Godzilla, but pretty much.

176
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
On NEOGEO.

177
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
NEOGEO.

178
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Anyway.

179
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Alright, forget it.

180
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,880
So, what's kind of interesting though, and this is, I guess, you know, your random Nintendo

181
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,680
game sighting.

182
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,720
They have an easter egg in their DS dictionary thing, because we don't get any actual non-games

183
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
over here.

184
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:13,080
Apparently, if you look up the word for ball, you can actually find, it says one of two

185
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,520
translations in the dictionary.

186
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
One of them that's grayed out.

187
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,680
If you click on the grayed out one, it brings up the Game & Watch game, Ball.

188
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,680
So you get to play that kind of little easter egg that's thrown in there.

189
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
And it was for them.

190
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Oh, hooray.

191
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
I love Ball.

192
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,360
I love Mr. Game & Watch.

193
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,080
I don't know.

194
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,560
Well, something else a lot of us love and can't wait to see a new version of this is

195
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,200
Punch Out!

196
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:48,840
And according to gonintendo.com, Punch Out! might be coming to the Wii pretty soon here.

197
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,600
Now of course, a lot of these rumors come from patents and trademark offices, and that's

198
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,560
where Go Nintendo is getting their idea from.

199
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,080
Nintendo filed a Punch Out! trademark again in April of 2005, and it was recently updated

200
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,680
on January 11th.

201
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,320
Now who knows if they're just kind of holding on to it, just making sure no one else tries

202
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,340
to take the name or whatever they're doing.

203
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,080
But certainly when you look at something like Wii Boxing, you can't help but go, it's just

204
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,080
a matter of time before this comes out on, you know, Punch Out! on the Wii.

205
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,320
It's too bad it won't be Mike Tyson's Punch Out! though.

206
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,080
That would be Mike Tyson's Ear Fest.

207
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,040
Mike Tyson's... never mind, I'm gonna make a really bad joke here, let's move on before

208
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,600
I get myself in trouble.

209
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
You know...

210
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,780
I just wanted to say I really love this game, I love the Nintendo Wii.

211
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,600
I'm sure his Wii, uh... never mind.

212
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,760
Also I love fighting off ears and rape!

213
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,440
Now this should make a lot of people very, very happy.

214
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:59,640
Tyson's favorite luchador, Strong Bad, is on the Wii, kinda.

215
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:11,240
The uh, our favorite developer, Vid-uh, Vid-electrics, has created Vid-electrics, which is a collection

216
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,400
of some of their games that are remastered for Wii control.

217
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,340
And uh, the quote says, the guys at Vid-electrics have reworked a few of your favorite games

218
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,640
for use on your favorite wave around controller game system.

219
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,440
I think that is great.

220
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:37,400
You have uh, Strong Bad Zone, Secret Collect, Kid Speedy, um, More to Come, Population Tire,

221
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,520
and More to Come.

222
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:48,240
You can um, you basically go to your Wii browser to um, the uh, I guess, it's the Vid-electrics

223
00:12:48,240 --> 00:13:02,200
page that of course is, you know, associated with HomestarRunner.com, um, but it's Vid-e-l-e-c-t-r-i-x-dot-com-slash-v-i-i-v.

224
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,600
You know, I predicted a while ago HomestarRunner was gonna jump the shark and sell out to like

225
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,500
Cartoon Network, but I guess I've been wrong.

226
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,000
They uh, still have been uh, just kind of trucking along with their web following there.

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,320
But now it's interesting to kind of see them tiptoeing into the console games a little

228
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
bit, you know.

229
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,600
I actually think it's pretty great that this started off as, you know, kind of not that

230
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,640
great books for children, and it just turned into this big internet phenomenon.

231
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,480
It just goes to show that good things come to those who wait, right?

232
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,720
We need A Peasant's Tale the game on Wii.

233
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,200
So since we've been doing this show five years now, just about, we should be getting those

234
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,160
rewards anytime soon now, huh?

235
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Right?

236
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Yeah?

237
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
That was funny.

238
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
We'll just be right here waiting for you.

239
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,760
La la la la la.

240
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:52,080
Anyways, other things you can do with your Wii, of course, non-Kozer things like modding

241
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
it.

242
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,120
In fact, there have been three teams that have been releasing their announcements for

243
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,440
Wii mod chips.

244
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,800
So before not, we're going to have backups and region-free Wiis, which is always good.

245
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,260
Well, the region-free part, at least.

246
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,040
One of these teams, Team Cyclops, they announced their Wii mod chip, which is supposed to be

247
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:22,000
able to play backups of both Wii and GameCube games, GameCube homebrew, imports of GameCube

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,080
games, and as well as DVD-R and support, and you're supposed to be able to have it as stealth

249
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,420
as well.

250
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,440
One other one that's actually supposed to be coming out pretty soon, it's called the

251
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,200
Wii Key, and that one's also going to be able to be updated via DVD, so it's supposed to

252
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,920
be future-proof, much like PlayStation 3, and it's supposed to be able to play backups

253
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,840
of both Wii and GameCube games, different region GameCube games and backups, multi-disc

254
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,600
games, and etc.

255
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,800
So this one's actually supposed to start shipping on February 7th, so maybe we'll find out a

256
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
little bit more of this next week.

257
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Interesting.

258
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,440
Are you going to order one?

259
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,040
I don't know how to solder for shit, so probably not.

260
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,020
I thought you used to do that.

261
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,120
If you've seen any of my solder jobs, they're awful.

262
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,840
You know somebody who has a very expensive soldering iron who has experience with doing

263
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,280
these types of things now?

264
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,480
You?

265
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
My hubby.

266
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,920
Oh, yeah, from the pinball stuff.

267
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,640
He fixes his own pinball machines and has put together his main cabinet.

268
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,560
Let's get him to mod your Wii, maybe.

269
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
All right.

270
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,600
Well, anyhow, one thing that you can do on the Wii, of course, is play old games, which

271
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,280
is funny because most people want to hack them to install emulators on them, but the

272
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Wii has one built in.

273
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,760
But the emulators are not perfect, as folks are finding out this week and downloading

274
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,640
Mario Kart 64 because you cannot save ghost data in Mario Kart 64.

275
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
Guess what?

276
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,280
Nintendo says, quote, due to unavoidable technical reasons, unfortunately it is not possible

277
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,760
to save ghost data for Mario 64's time trials in the virtual console version of the game.

278
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,760
They did place messages advising users about this before they download the game when the

279
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,880
Wii Shop channel is first accessed and in the more details tab on the individual game

280
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
page.

281
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
That's true.

282
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,200
The manual, they're in big red letters, you can't save ghost data.

283
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
I honestly think people are making too big a deal out of this.

284
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:26,040
I didn't have a memory pack when I owned Mario Kart 64, so I never had ghost data anyway.

285
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,560
How many people had a Nintendo 64, let alone the memory pack?

286
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Of course, I know that's just opening up for the chat to start going, me, me, me, me, me,

287
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,160
but honestly, I don't think this is as huge of a loss.

288
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,600
What I suppose where people are getting frustrated is that the Wii has this giant storage built

289
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
into it.

290
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,640
Why can't the emulator be smart enough to just save to the Wii thing?

291
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,880
Like virtual memory cards on the PlayStation 3.

292
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,960
But you'd be talking about going in and editing Mario Kart 64's game information to do that

293
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,720
because it would be talking about accessing data a whole other way.

294
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,600
You'd have to rewrite the game or recompile the game.

295
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,400
Perhaps they could patch it with, I don't know, Wii Connect 24 that they're not using?

296
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
They're not going to do it.

297
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Nintendo says they're not going to do it.

298
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,840
The PC emulators, though, always saved the information.

299
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,360
The ROMs themselves actually have the emulator built into it when you're downloading it,

300
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,520
so it wouldn't be that hard for them to fix that.

301
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,800
All they have to do is edit the emulator.

302
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
But no.

303
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,880
Yeah, why should they?

304
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,280
Because no one really cares about that shit anyways.

305
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,600
Well, Legend of Zaku agrees and says, ghost data?

306
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Who the fuck uses that?

307
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,440
And that's probably followed up by Boco Fett saying, I love ghost mode.

308
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,000
And Rob D seems to agree they could include a patch with the game.

309
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,760
This is all coming from our chatroom chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

310
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,720
Hitstun says, oh, come on, you can't emulate a friggin' controller pack?

311
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,280
I think it just might be in the way that the original system talked to the hardware.

312
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,920
I don't know if it's as easy as folks think it is.

313
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Well, just like they were talking about doing it later on.

314
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,880
If it was that easy, Nintendo would have done it.

315
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Rumble later on.

316
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Maybe through an add-on?

317
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Yeah.

318
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Well, how about multiplayer online?

319
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,640
I think all of us would forgive Nintendo for the stupid ghost thing if we could do some

320
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
multiplayer online.

321
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Wouldn't that be pretty awesome?

322
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,520
Oh, that would be fuckin' awesome.

323
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
In the real world, however.

324
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,040
And M64 says, Skya, I think you only download the emulator once per system.

325
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,520
Not sure on the specifics of that, possibly.

326
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Who knows?

327
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,120
But you see, the thing, though, is once you purchase a game, you can delete it and redownload

328
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
it again.

329
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,600
So if that's the case, they could say, OK, there's an update to this game, please redownload

330
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
it.

331
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
And boom.

332
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Done.

333
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,000
And you're supposed to do all that automatically.

334
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Right.

335
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
ReConnect24 is a service that they sell, but don't actually fuckin' use.

336
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So what's the point?

337
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But that's not a surprise.

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
They did the same thing on the DS.

339
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Same thing.

340
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Anyhow.

341
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,200
Yeah, I know.

342
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Let's move on.

343
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,840
Let's get some more user feedback.

344
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,280
And one way we invite you guys, the listeners, to come on and be a part of the program, because

345
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
it's not just us.

346
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,560
I mean, you know, this is your show, too.

347
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,040
And one way you can participate is by sending us an email to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

348
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,880
Every week, DarkSakura opens up the email bag and dives in and grabs a few of her favorite

349
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,800
letters, and reads them here on air.

350
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
It's the Mailbag segment.

351
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,280
Slim Pickens this week, though, right, DarkSakura?

352
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Not a lot of emails?

353
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Well, we got a bunch of big fat ones.

354
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Oh, there you go.

355
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
We like long letters.

356
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,560
Well, one of the emails comes from GS191.

357
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:25,400
However, I'm not reading the part about Jennifer Strange, because honestly, I'm sick of it.

358
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,800
Although we appreciate the feedback, I think we're all trying to move on from that whole

359
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
thing.

360
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
But thank you for your insight.

361
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Thank you for being on the Internet.

362
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,760
You know, and as you find us, financial assessment and your very own name is, you know, what

363
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,740
we're thinking, and we...

364
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,740
Anyway.

365
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,600
Oh, there's also the disclaimer that...

366
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,680
Just because Loki wasn't on a mic Loki said we just can't continue to drown ourselves

367
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
in that information.

368
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Arr!

369
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,340
It smells like meat in here.

370
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,320
Because he's eating a hamburger and he left the cart open.

371
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,480
Which you know what that means.

372
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,780
French fries stealing.

373
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,880
Fries stealing!

374
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
O shit.

375
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,600
Okay, an Ebony.

376
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Sorry.

377
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,720
I need an eat em.

378
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,060
Oh no, I need an wiener.

379
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,600
Talk with your mouth full.

380
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Okay.

381
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I don't know what I read in the email.

382
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Okay, now the Frapper map, the bane of my existence.

383
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Can I smell fries in my mouth?

384
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I really don't know what to do.

385
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Give me more fries, give me more fries.

386
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
These are good fries.

387
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
They're elephant bar, they're pretty good.

388
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
That one was too salty though.

389
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I really don't know what to do anymore about the Frapper map.

390
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Ever since the switch from Google Maps to Yahoo Maps,

391
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
the performance of the website has gone down a lot.

392
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,600
I really screwed up the editing and refer to the point that you can go to your forums,

393
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,600
you can do that, but it takes out the shout out listings on the Frapper page.

394
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,600
So you're forced to use their forums if you want to see shout outs on the page.

395
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Or if you use your own forums, take it automatically.

396
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,600
It takes the shout outs off the page.

397
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Being the administrator of the Frapper map, I'm at a fork in the road.

398
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
There are many times that I was so discontent with the map

399
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,600
that I almost leave the map and start over again.

400
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,600
The one good thing is that there is an embedded HTML option when I customize the map,

401
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,600
so that gives me some hope on getting this to where I like it,

402
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
and hopefully everyone else does too.

403
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Currently the map has 141 members,

404
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
but I know that there is a much larger community out there.

405
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,600
With more support, it will motivate me further, hopefully.

406
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,600
So as of now, I will keep it up, but if the Frapper screws up again,

407
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
I just don't know what to do.

408
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
We'll try to support the Frapper map, and I will do my best to maintain it.

409
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Thank you.

410
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Look at our Frapper map. It's pretty nice.

411
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
I have it up on the screen here.

412
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
If you want to see it, it's frapper.com slash orange lounge radio.

413
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,600
There's really nothing to this besides just the fact it's kind of cool to see where our listeners are.

414
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,600
You notice we have a lot scattered throughout the U.S.,

415
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,600
but what I'm really noticing a lack of is the pins over in the U.K.

416
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Look at that.

417
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
There's like three pins over there.

418
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Come on.

419
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
I know we've got more listeners than that over there,

420
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,600
and then look, Australia, if I go over to Australia, there's like a pin.

421
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,600
So we want to especially, not that we love our U.S. listeners,

422
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,600
we want to really see some of our international listeners put a pin in the map somewhere,

423
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
but I am going to steal what they do at All Games Interactive.

424
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I am going to replace what's over here.

425
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
We're going to put a big map up here,

426
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,600
and we're going to put pins in whenever we get calls and the e-mails from different parts of the world.

427
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
We'll have one color for calls and one color for e-mails.

428
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
So we're going to start our own real-life Frapper.

429
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,600
But in the meantime, the online one will have to do frapper.com slash orange lounge radio.

430
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,600
That was a fan-created thing, so thank you to this e-mailer who created it.

431
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Hugs and kisses.

432
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Well, next e-mail.

433
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Hi, guys.

434
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
DDR Dollar Bill here.

435
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Hoping your days are going well for you guys.

436
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Thanks for the updates from Konami Gamer's Day,

437
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,600
which now made my picking of the newest system very difficult.

438
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
This is why.

439
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,600
This weekend I was in the Chinatown section here in New York,

440
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
and while browsing through the anime picked up three series I haven't seen yet,

441
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I was also checking out the imports and had some thoughts.

442
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
In the past, in order to play imported games,

443
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,600
the systems would need to be modified in some fashion.

444
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I can recall back in the cartridge systems where you'd have to buy an adapter to play these games

445
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,600
or actually just break open your Super Nintendo and pull stuff out.

446
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Super Nintendo one was funny.

447
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Or having your CD DVD-based systems modified with a mod chip or swap desk or a paper clip.

448
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Sorry.

449
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
I know that the Game Boy DS systems did not need any modification,

450
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
which is probably why I enjoyed them the most.

451
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
My question is this.

452
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,600
For the systems I did not list that are current are the following true.

453
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Xbox 360 region locked.

454
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
No safe mod exists.

455
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Safe as in you will not be banned from Xbox Live.

456
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Wii region locked. No mod exists yet.

457
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
PS3 not region locked on PS3 games.

458
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Region locked on PS2 games.

459
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
PSP not region locked.

460
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,600
I'm asking this because I'm going to be getting back into purchasing import titles,

461
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
not just the Bemani stuff,

462
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
but also some of their wrestling games,

463
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,600
which has been more original and fun than the Smackdown vs. Raw,

464
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,600
and other little oddities such as D.O.N. DBZ vs. One Piece vs. Naruto.

465
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
I don't care about playing backup copies, honestly,

466
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,600
and I don't want to get one system of each,

467
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
as that would be a waste of money.

468
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,600
I wish they would just let everyone pick and choose what to play,

469
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
regardless of where it's coming from.

470
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Anywho, I could go on for another hour, but I'll leave it like that.

471
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
See you guys in the chat room tonight.

472
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
PS, I miss freestyle sometimes.

473
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,600
I do believe the PlayStation 3 regions for the game.

474
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
At least Blu-Ray.

475
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
One is both Japan and the United States.

476
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,600
When we talk about importing Japanese games, I think that works.

477
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
At least I don't know about the movies that might work,

478
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
but the games I'm not sure.

479
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Once again, you probably just need to check maybe with import sites

480
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
to deal with that kind of stuff, whether that will work or not.

481
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
360 I know doesn't.

482
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I'm going to be in San Francisco this weekend,

483
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,600
so if I go by Mikado I can ask them there since they keep up with all that.

484
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I know they were saying that it is and it isn't,

485
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
but I know it's not region free,

486
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,600
but I think that we're in the same region as Japan now.

487
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Interesting.

488
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,600
That makes sense because we're both NTSC.

489
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Not that it's going to matter for anything in a high definition format,

490
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
but I can sort of see it.

491
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says,

492
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
You can use the GameCube freeloader on the Wii.

493
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Positive. I've seen it done.

494
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
I have a freeloader.

495
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
But that's only for GameCube games.

496
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
That's not for Wii games.

497
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
I'm still going to check it out though.

498
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I want to try it for myself.

499
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
But that's pretty cool.

500
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
It's really only a matter of time though

501
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
before anything that is region locked will be unlocked.

502
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
I am one of those people who said,

503
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,600
I'm not modding my PS2 and went out and bought a JPS2.

504
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Ditto. I did it too.

505
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
PlayStation 2 Japanese games do not work on a US PlayStation 2.

506
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Or a PlayStation 3.

507
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
I know somebody in chat,

508
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
I think Black Boy says PS2 Japanese games work on PlayStation 3,

509
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
but actually one of the sites had video of trying Kingdom Hearts 2,

510
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
the import on PlayStation 3,

511
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
and it came up with an error message.

512
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
So I'm not sure if that's true.

513
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,600
One thing though that I am curious about though is the freeloader.

514
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,600
If they're going to have...

515
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Well, not the freeloader,

516
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,600
but what was the one for PlayStation hard drive?

517
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
HD loader?

518
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
HD loader. That was it.

519
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
If they're going to be coming up with something like that.

520
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
But it's still out there for the PlayStation 2.

521
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,600
If you can find the old style one or even the new style one,

522
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,600
you can download the HD loader that actually fits on your memory card.

523
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,600
And then you just plug in a USB drive.

524
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Or USB hard drive or something like that.

525
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
And it works great for imports.

526
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Well, they even have the thing where you can...

527
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
I guess it's the same thing.

528
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,600
You download it directly to your hard drive on the system.

529
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I mean, not that we're condoning that eye roll,

530
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,600
but I wonder if they're going to have something like that for PS3

531
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
and then that makes the importing...

532
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Or you remember back in the days with the GameCube

533
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,600
how they had the whole GD-ROM rip through the VMU unit.

534
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Remember that?

535
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,600
I wonder if they'd be doing something along those lines too.

536
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Just to clarify, it looks like I understand where I misunderstood.

537
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Black Boy said,

538
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,600
I've played Japanese PlayStation 2 games on the Japanese PlayStation 3.

539
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Well, yeah, that'll work. I thought he meant Japanese PlayStation 2 to US PlayStation 3.

540
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
And that's what the video was of.

541
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
So, oops.

542
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Okay.

543
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Next email.

544
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
And this comes from Neki, our friend.

545
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Hi, Neki.

546
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Heya, O-L-R.

547
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Didn't get around to emailing last week, but I got some stuff today.

548
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
This is my second time typing this.

549
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Since the first one screwed up, I hope it doesn't happen again.

550
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Check out attachment one.

551
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Okay, I didn't actually see there was attachments with this one.

552
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,600
It will show the Wii with over 4 million sales,

553
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
the 360 with 10 million,

554
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,600
and the PS3 with the tiny 1 million owned.

555
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,600
I would just like to give a big shout out towards my home forum site,

556
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,600
dscommunity.co.uk.

557
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
It's nice and fun, so everyone join the forums.

558
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
There's your free shout out.

559
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Oh, yeah, and by the way, we are doing a DS tournament on Wednesday

560
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,600
starting from, it looks like July 2nd this year

561
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,600
at about 7 to 12 p.m. GMT.

562
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Everyone is welcome, but it would be a good idea to join the forums first

563
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
plus we got chat.

564
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Anyway, there's your free plug.

565
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Free plug.

566
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Did they plug us on their forums?

567
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
That's what I want to know.

568
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Plug us on your forums now because we're awesome.

569
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Yes, fries. Rock.

570
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,600
And so a question for me is where it got the music.

571
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Dude, fries.

572
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
I'm not like hungry.

573
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
I haven't eaten since there's pancakes today.

574
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Gave me an email.

575
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Okay, sorry.

576
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Sorry, necky.

577
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,600
A question for me was where did they get the music for the show.

578
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:10,600
I really went about the FUs of the Week,

579
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,600
your website of the week and the show's ending music.

580
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,600
The FUs of the Week music is actually from the Final Fantasy VII

581
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Advent Children movie.

582
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
It's the one wing angel.

583
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:30,600
The big final battle in that movie, yep.

584
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,600
The website of the week music, isn't that Journey to Wonderland?

585
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
No, that's the mailbag music.

586
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
It's Journey to Wonderland.

587
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Website of the Week is from DDR Ohastas.

588
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
That's right.

589
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
It's candy.

590
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,600
You can actually dance to that in the Japanese version of DDR.

591
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
I've done it.

592
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
It's awesome.

593
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,600
The first is the Ohastasian kids version.

594
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
It's kind of cute.

595
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,600
What was the Ohaska?

596
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
It's got a lot of cute songs in it.

597
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
It's fun.

598
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
And our ending show music, Rob knows that one because it's from Beatmania.

599
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
It's Akira Yamaoka, iFuturist.

600
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Also in DDR Supernova, I believe.

601
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Yep.

602
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,600
The godly and studly Akira Yamaoka who produces Silent Hill now as well.

603
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,600
I was actually watching the making of Silent Hill 3 and he was in it and he sounded really hoarse.

604
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
He's such a rock star.

605
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
I met him once like three years ago.

606
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
He was awesome.

607
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
I like his business cards.

608
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Anyway, can't think of anything else.

609
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Thanks for the podcast.

610
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Really enjoy it.

611
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Keep it up, Nike.

612
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
P.S. I found a Dr. Who thing you might get very excited about.

613
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Haven't read it all as it's long.

614
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Dr. Who the game?

615
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Huh.

616
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Why don't we talk about something like that?

617
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
Oh my god.

618
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Huh.

619
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
It looks like they're going to be doing a Dr. Who game.

620
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
That's not a big surprise.

621
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
That makes me a happy fangirl.

622
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Alright.

623
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Oh, they're showing some of the old games though like the PC Dalek games anyway.

624
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Anyway, that's for me later.

625
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Anything else?

626
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Yes.

627
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Oh, sorry.

628
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Hi.

629
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
This is from Bandit.

630
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Hi guys.

631
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
How's it going?

632
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Been listening to the show for a while and decided to send in an email for a change.

633
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,600
I just wanted to stop and voice an opinion that I've had for a while about moving to

634
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
the next gen.

635
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Sure, when you look at the shiny new hardware that's out there from the big three, you may

636
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,600
want to go out and buy the newest and greatest, but at this point, I've seen no reason to

637
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
do so yet.

638
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,600
After all of these years of playing games, mostly competitive type games, I've become

639
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,600
more of a casual gamer than anything.

640
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,600
I find myself spending more time reading gaming news through various online sites than actually

641
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
playing them.

642
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,600
It was really hard not to just throw down the cash and buy a new console on any of the

643
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,600
launches, but I had to take a step back and look at what I currently have.

644
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,600
The prime console I own is the PS2.

645
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,600
When I actually took a look back at the games that I've yet to play over the years, I realized

646
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,600
that purchasing a new console would be a bad idea, especially considering the prices of

647
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
games now.

648
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I've actually never played God of War, Devil May Cry 1 or 3, and many other critically

649
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,600
reviewed, I'm sorry, acclaimed titles like these.

650
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
There's not enough time in the day to play everything.

651
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I haven't played some of those.

652
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I really missed a lot of great titles on the PS2 by only playing certain games such as

653
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Madden and Tekken 5.

654
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Certainly with the case of Tekken 5, I would spend hours learning a character's move list

655
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
and practicing before visiting a group of the best local players here in Pittsburgh

656
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,600
who go by the name of Steel City Tekken.

657
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Believe me, the practice had to be done to stand a chance against them.

658
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Now, getting back to the point I'm trying to make, if you're the type of person who

659
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,600
missed out on a lot of games from the PS2 era, take a look at how many great AAA titles

660
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,600
you can buy on that console for the price of one next-gen game.

661
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,600
After looking through EB Games 1999 and Undersection on their site, I saw that you could get up

662
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,600
to seven PS2 games for the price of one $60 next-gen title.

663
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,600
So if you haven't yet made the commitment to any new next-gen console, I would go as

664
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,600
to say that the PS2 has one of the two greatest library of games ever on any console.

665
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,600
The original NES will always be first, in my opinion.

666
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Also remember that the PS2 is not dead yet.

667
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,600
We still have Luminesce Live, God of War 2, and Final Cut of Kingdoms Hearts 2 to play soon.

668
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Since I decided to stick with the PS2 a little longer, I went out and picked up a few games

669
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
that I missed.

670
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,600
I grabbed Syphon Filter Omega Stream, Devil May Cry Collector's Box Set, and Area 51,

671
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,600
not the original that was in the arcades and on the PS1 Saturn, for less than $60.

672
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,600
A five-to-one game ratio really sounds good to me right now.

673
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,600
I could write much more to prove my point, but I'm sure everyone can see where I'm coming

674
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
from.

675
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Anyway, have a great show, and long live the PS2.

676
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Could I say, though, that two of those games he says that we have to look forward to, we've

677
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,600
kind of already played, like Luminesce Live and Kingdom Hearts 2.

678
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,600
I mean, granted, you have some new stuff with those, but essentially we've seen those before.

679
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,600
I stopped playing Kingdom Hearts 2 as soon as they announced the Final Cut, because I'm

680
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
going to start over on that one.

681
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
All right, whatever.

682
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Seriously.

683
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
I understand.

684
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I understand.

685
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
I need to go back and finish Kingdom Hearts 1.

686
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
I never finish games.

687
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
I can't.

688
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
There's not enough time in the day.

689
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,600
I have to really love a game to finish it, and then my problem is I get sucked into MMOs.

690
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Well, here's the last email, and I'm not going to read all of it, because there's a bunch

691
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,600
of reviews about the same sequel of the games and everything.

692
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Hey, OLR.

693
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,600
This is the information about the Shadow Hearts RPG series that I promised a couple of weeks

694
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
ago.

695
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
I apologize for taking so long.

696
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
I definitely recommend that you give the series a try.

697
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,600
The first Shadow Hearts game, however, is hard to find, so you might have to find it

698
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
on eBay.

699
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
I'm interested on your opinions about the series.

700
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Have a great night.

701
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Shadow next gen.

702
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,600
And we have various links to them, so I'm going to check them out a little bit later.

703
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Shadow Hearts, the series?

704
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Yeah.

705
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,600
I know the last one that came out of New World looked pretty good.

706
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Just didn't play it, because I don't have time to play every obscure RPG out there.

707
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
But yeah, it looked pretty cool.

708
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Kind of a unique concept, kind of set in the 1940s, I believe.

709
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:09,600
You play a detective son who ends up finding these portals to another dimension almost,

710
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,600
and the stuff starts coming through, and basically has to fight it with a bunch of your usual,

711
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:22,600
typical RPG plot, a bunch of people that have no reason to be together, kind of come together,

712
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
and fight monsters and stuff.

713
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,600
It looks like a lot of folks in chat room agree with my gamer ADD perspective.

714
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, you're not the only one who does that.

715
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Paradox Vincent says, OMG, thank you, Sky, thank you, thank you, I'm not alone.

716
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
That's why I play music games.

717
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,600
And I think, to go back to what I had said in part A about somebody had said all I ever

718
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,600
seem to play are Xbox Live Arcade games, I think that might go help to explain it right

719
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,600
there, is that Xbox Live Arcade games, again, they're quick and not a lot of time, and really

720
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
satisfy my gamer ADD.

721
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,600
And yet, why I keep going back to World of Warcraft, I'll never understand.

722
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
I think it's the social aspect of that.

723
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Who knows?

724
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Well, my whole thing is, that's sort of why I was stuck on Cooking Mama for that long.

725
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,600
But, you know, I was thinking about it, and I own a lot of games that I haven't given

726
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
the attention that I'd like to give.

727
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,600
So, like, I'm going back, I've started over on Papalo Cross, just because, you know how

728
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,600
I was up in arms about how much I wanted to play that game, you know, for years.

729
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,600
So, I actually started over on Papalo Cross, so I can get to where I got before and actually

730
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
play through it this time.

731
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,600
You know, the reality is, you work, go to school, I work, do my hobbies on the side,

732
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,600
so does, you know, Loki, and all you folks who listen.

733
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,600
You're probably working right now, or school, or whatever it is you do.

734
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
There is not always enough time during the day.

735
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,600
And, you know, part of this show is that we don't claim to be the experts on every single

736
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
game out there.

737
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,600
And, certainly, there's those games we feel passionate about, but we're just like you

738
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
guys.

739
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,600
We're not getting paid to play games eight hours a day.

740
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
If somebody wanted to do that, great.

741
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I mean, because, essentially, that's what you do when you visit those big websites,

742
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,600
like, you know, I'm not going to name them, but the ones that are, you know, sponsored

743
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,600
by magazine companies and things, you know.

744
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Keep in mind, like, just my next week, I'm going to school four nights next week, doing

745
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,600
a CPR class, working on a website, working on art commissions, and working full-time.

746
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,600
So, I mean, that's a standard week.

747
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:22,600
You know, I, we don't get to have free time all the time to do all the stuff that we,

748
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,600
you know, would like to do, you know, to play all the, all the games.

749
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,600
And, you know, that's why- But when I do have free time, it's all about

750
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
the games.

751
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Well, what I was trying to say is that that's why, you know, when we do the show, we actually

752
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,600
come and tell each other so that we can each give each other the impression of what we're,

753
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
you know, we're looking at.

754
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,600
You know, what's quick and easy to play, what's going to be a little time consuming, what

755
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
project's going on, that type of thing.

756
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
And no more e-mail, by the way.

757
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Makes sense.

758
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Except I got some spam, which I deleted.

759
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
I can say this.

760
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,600
I got an e-mail, and I neglected to mention this during housekeeping, but I'll mention

761
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,600
it next week so it's at the top of the show, because I know not everyone listens to the

762
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
whole thing.

763
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,600
But I do want to confirm that Orange Laundry is going to be back at Fauna Mae Con this

764
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,600
year, which is being held from May 25th to May 28th at the San Jose Convention Center.

765
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
At the San Jose Convention Center in California.

766
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
So.

767
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Right?

768
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
I'll be there for the weekend.

769
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Gotcha.

770
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Okay.

771
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
The whole, I just found this out, too.

772
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Right.

773
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Dan's younger brother, his step-brother, is getting married the weekend before that.

774
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
I see.

775
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,600
So, I will definitely be there Saturday and Sunday.

776
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
Yeah, yeah.

777
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Or Friday afternoon if I can at all manage it.

778
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,480
Even though we might not be there from open to close, we'll be there definitely doing

779
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,040
a live panel and taping a show live, like we did last year.

780
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,480
And I will be cosplaying as Annette Renard now.

781
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,080
I have no idea what I'm going to cosplay as, because I don't usually do cosplay, but we'll

782
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
see.

783
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,300
But regardless, cosplay aside, we'd love to see you guys turn out for the show.

784
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,920
As I understand, one of our listeners, Rama, is coming out from the East Coast for this

785
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,960
convention and has rented a fat hotel room, so it's going to be like a mini-OLR con of

786
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
sorts.

787
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,480
Fauna Mae Con is the sideshow.

788
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,760
I definitely need to remake my Temari costume, because the last one that was made, it was

789
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
too big.

790
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,480
So, we'll have more details on our involvement with Fauna Mae as the event approaches, but

791
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,200
that's really exciting, because we definitely are looking forward to bringing more video

792
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,760
game type content to Fauna Mae, because I don't know a lot about anime, so I can only

793
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,560
talk about video games.

794
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,800
Maybe Jamie can do the anime thing.

795
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
I can.

796
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm actually thinking about starting to watch Bleach.

797
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,760
I watch Bleach when I pour it in the washer.

798
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
Alright.

799
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Anyways, so, not having anything to do with Bleach or anime or anything like that, apparently,

800
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,920
well, unless you lived under a rock or something, you probably didn't realize, well, Vista just

801
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
came out.

802
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,040
All 50 billion- OMG, it did?

803
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Yeah, really.

804
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm just rushing right out to go buy it, like I did with XP.

805
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:09,560
But, if you happen to be gaming on a PC that has the parental control set on it, it might

806
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,800
actually break some of your casual games, like games that use Wild Tangent.

807
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:24,320
And according to your gamer, DirectX creator Alex St. John says, basically, that they tried

808
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,160
making sure that it wouldn't break all the different games out there, they thought they

809
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,640
covered everything, but unfortunately, Wild Tangent is denoted as spyware by the anti-spyware

810
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,960
applications in Vista, and says, normally the software is generally harmless, but it

811
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:48,240
does get installed without express- Isn't Wild Tangent the games that come with

812
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,880
AOL Instant Messenger, because those games are spyware.

813
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
I'm sorry.

814
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,480
Yeah, I think so.

815
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Wild Tangent is spyware.

816
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
So, whatever.

817
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:02,720
I mean, it's not a huge deal, but just thought you might want to know, because there are

818
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,160
some people that like casual games like Christopher and-

819
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,840
Black Boy says, wow, Loki's News is old, they patched this already.

820
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,280
Yes, it is old.

821
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,560
And you know, it's just like, I don't care.

822
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,080
But nevertheless, you know, isn't it funny that they rolled out an operating system and

823
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,560
it broke half the games on it?

824
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,560
I mean, why should I upgrade to Windows Vista, anybody?

825
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,700
Would anybody like to tell me why I need to drop the money right now to upgrade to Windows

826
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
Vista?

827
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,700
I'm not going to.

828
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,700
You should upgrade your computer, too.

829
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,700
Because I don't- What?

830
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,700
You gotta upgrade your computer, too.

831
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,600
I don't understand why I need to upgrade right now.

832
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
I'm not.

833
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,240
I don't want to- This is all the more reason for me to just buy my iMac.

834
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,360
Screw Windows.

835
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,280
I mean, between the PC I have now and the Mac, I'm doing just fine.

836
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,560
I don't need Windows Vista.

837
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,560
What?

838
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,700
You look like you want to say something smart-ass so bad.

839
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,700
It's hurting you.

840
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,700
That's fine.

841
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,700
That's fine.

842
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,700
You guys are fine with your Macs.

843
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,700
That's great.

844
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,320
I'm sure games will come to it eventually.

845
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,680
I don't play PC games and the only PC game I play is World of Warcraft.

846
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,400
And I have Guild Wars on my laptop so I don't have to worry about it.

847
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,560
Jeremy Todd 1 says there's no reason to upgrade right now.

848
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Simple as that.

849
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,760
Just upgrade in a couple years and there's actually a reason to upgrade.

850
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,100
DDR Dollar Bill says Vista has had a lot of returns.

851
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,100
So we'll see.

852
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,100
Maybe later.

853
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:28,160
I don't know how well it's running.

854
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,600
I'm hearing it's got performance issues.

855
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,040
But nevertheless, this is certainly something you're not seeing returned as often.

856
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,240
It's World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade.

857
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,440
You think people are World of Warcraft addicts here.

858
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,480
You should check out China because the Nine released World of Warcraft locally for China.

859
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,480
They got 3.5 million subscribers in China.

860
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,600
So it's pretty big over there as well.

861
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Well guess what?

862
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,960
Burning Crusade is also going to be coming to China, which I suppose isn't the most shocking

863
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
news in the world.

864
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,380
But maybe you didn't realize it wasn't already out over there.

865
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,160
They're going to have to wait a little bit for this game.

866
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,060
So Chinese localization is already underway for the Burning Crusade and the Nine is working

867
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:14,200
closely with Blizzard to offer all the same support that Blizzard offers to the US customers

868
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,320
and also the distribution and all that stuff.

869
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,100
A quick quote here from Blizzard, quote, we're fully committed to ensuring that the ongoing

870
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,040
operation of World of Warcraft in mainland China will provide an excellent experience

871
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,160
for players there for many years to come.

872
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,620
We look forward to extending that commitment with this expansion as well as with future

873
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,160
Blizzard releases.

874
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,040
So it sounds like if we get it here, you're going to get it in China from the Nine, even

875
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,840
if it is a little bit later on.

876
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,160
You have to just wait for all the localization and stuff.

877
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,000
Like well, we have to do that for Japanese games.

878
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,840
So it's only fair that that side of the world has to wait for us once in a while.

879
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,760
Oh, and then they get the joy of patching.

880
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,800
Yes, then you get to patch World of Warcraft seven times before you can play it.

881
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
It's so much fun.

882
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,800
And then it won't patch and then you have to download it and do it yourself.

883
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Cool.

884
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,800
Anyway.

885
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Actually, can I suggest this real quick?

886
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,040
XFire has a patching system built in that's actually pretty good.

887
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,160
I have to say you wouldn't think I would usually endorse a program like XFire, but actually

888
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
it's really cool.

889
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,920
I really like XFire.

890
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,200
I think that's a great little application, anyway, for a PC gamer.

891
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,200
Anyway, sorry.

892
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
We'll take your word for it, Rob.

893
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Yeah, please do.

894
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Okay.

895
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,460
Speaking of MMOs, there is an MMO coming to the UK.

896
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,200
It's called Two Worlds.

897
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,880
It's being released on PC and Xbox 360.

898
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:38,760
The good thing about it, it's a free roaming RPG that's the orc versus human deal.

899
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:52,960
But the cool thing is that it has unique quests, a one-on-one arena battle, horse races, and

900
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,840
customizable characters with no level capping.

901
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,440
So that's pretty cool.

902
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,200
I can truly be a god character in that game.

903
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,720
I hear it's very similar to Oblivion.

904
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,720
Yeah.

905
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,720
Very similar to Oblivion.

906
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,440
Jeremy Tell One wants to point out and clarify from what he's read about the game.

907
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,160
The 360 version only has eight player multiplayer.

908
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,400
Only the PC version is an MMO.

909
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,160
Eight players is still not bad.

910
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
That's still fun.

911
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,880
That's still an OL army.

912
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,880
And eight players.

913
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,880
That'll be fun.

914
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,920
Now, here's what I want to know, because I haven't really read up on much.

915
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,880
I wonder if Crackdown is more than two players co-op, because that'd be awesome if you have

916
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,880
like four people.

917
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
Hmm.

918
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
I don't know.

919
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,840
I guess we'll see more when the game comes out, because if it's coming on 360, we'll

920
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,320
probably get a demo.

921
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
So who knows?

922
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,320
Yeah.

923
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:44,640
Anyways, so just like tons of stuff coming out now on the 360, including some brand new

924
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,560
Xbox Live Arcade games.

925
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,520
And they announced ten new games that are going to be coming out.

926
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,340
Some of these we've heard of before.

927
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,560
Some we have not.

928
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,960
For example, 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures.

929
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,760
A little bit different than 3D Ultra Mini Golf.

930
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,120
It was one of the Sierra Online games, which I loved, by the way.

931
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,600
So that's going to become an Alien Hominid HD, which is kind of an HD upgrade to the

932
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
original Alien Hominid game.

933
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,320
Band of Bugs, which is supposed to be by Ninjabi.

934
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,280
It's kind of a, I guess, a strategy game.

935
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,280
It's kind of neat.

936
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,600
Castlevania Symphony of Night.

937
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,000
No big surprise there.

938
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Catan.

939
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Settlers Catan.

940
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,120
Remember that was one that was remembered to be coming at some point.

941
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,120
Eats.

942
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Chowdown.

943
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,640
Kind of a different game, I guess, as a port of a PC title by the same name.

944
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,780
Luxor 2, which should make Nelly happy.

945
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,560
Another kind of Zuma clone type of thing.

946
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,400
Paper Boy.

947
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,800
Root Beer Tapper.

948
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,360
Paper Boy and Root Beer Tapper are awesome.

949
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,980
I know you guys bitch about the classic coin-op ports, but these are some true classics that

950
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,280
are underrated, I think.

951
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:52,740
And then my favorite of the list here, Worms HD is going to be coming out, and that's awesome.

952
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:57,520
We used to have epic Worms multiplayer going on in my house.

953
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,520
Worms is awesome.

954
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,420
You know what's interesting though, and we neglected to say this in our coverage of Konami

955
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,600
Gamer's Day, but did you notice they had nothing on Xbox Live Arcade?

956
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,720
I was very surprised we didn't see Castlevania Symphony of Night on Live Arcade, because

957
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,720
they had it at CES.

958
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,440
I would have thought that's what they would have used their 360s for instead of showing

959
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
Wii 11.

960
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,840
That's kind of what I thought we were going to see too, but I guess not.

961
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
That's alright.

962
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:25,040
Alright, well, speaking of Xbox Live, Crackdown has shattered records on Xbox Live.

963
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,140
You know it had a demo released, and it shattered the demos, or shattered records away from

964
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:35,140
Lost Planet and Fight Night, the most downloaded demo for a 24-hour period, and the most downloaded

965
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:41,640
demo during a seven-day period, and that's without Halo 3, you know, beta stuff.

966
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,800
I don't know if people are maybe downloading this to see if it's worth it, if they want

967
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
to do the Halo 3.

968
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
It's fun.

969
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,800
I've played the demo.

970
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,800
I can play the demo all week.

971
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
I couldn't get into it.

972
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,300
I'll have to do co-op with somebody who can kind of show me what the hell I'm supposed

973
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,320
to be doing, because I didn't get it, but I'm stupid sometimes.

974
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,240
You can punch people, then throw them in the cars, and then throw cars on top of them,

975
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
and then you can, like...

976
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,240
I'll try it again.

977
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,000
What's great, though, is they have achievements for throwing dead bodies into the air, then

978
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,720
bouncing them off, or bouncing rockets off of them.

979
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,200
I'll just have to come over and watch you play at some point, and see if it's worth

980
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,200
it for me.

981
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,200
It's so worth it.

982
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,200
I swear I'm going to sign up for a game rental site or something this week, so I stop buying

983
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,480
all this stuff new.

984
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,040
We'll see.

985
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,960
Anyhow, I guess that's all I have to say about Crackdown.

986
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:32,680
Well, there is different games to be downloaded, especially Castlevania Symphony of the Night

987
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,600
on Xbox Live Arcade.

988
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:41,760
They were talking about the memory card coming out that was supposed to be 256 megabytes,

989
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:50,880
but the pre-order on GameStop's website is 512 megabytes for the portable memory.

990
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,920
So in other words, they give it a secret upgrade.

991
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,680
Now it's 512.

992
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,400
Or is it a typo on GameStop's end?

993
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,400
What do you think, Loki?

994
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,760
I haven't heard of anything official about them upgrading that, although I'm assuming

995
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:08,560
that we'll find something new, or find out something about it pretty soon, if not at

996
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
all.

997
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,680
It seems kind of logical that would happen, though, right?

998
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,680
Yeah.

999
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,160
I mean, it makes sense, because 256, I mean, the price point for it was a bit more expensive,

1000
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,080
and I don't know why you'd buy a memory unit anyways.

1001
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,360
I mean, spend the extra money and just get a hard drive.

1002
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,360
That's what I say.

1003
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,520
Just get the damn hard drive, unless you really have a need to take that shit with you on

1004
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,520
the go.

1005
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,520
There's really no point.

1006
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,520
Exactly.

1007
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,360
So, yeah, no idea if this is official yet.

1008
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,360
I'd imagine...

1009
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,440
I don't think it's going to be a typo, because I think originally they had 256 on there,

1010
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,440
so they probably just got it updated.

1011
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,440
Interesting.

1012
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
I don't know.

1013
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,440
I'll keep my eyes out.

1014
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,440
Please do.

1015
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,440
Eyes and ears.

1016
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,760
I'll check them out.

1017
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,920
But anywho, so beyond the bigger memory cards, there is going to be another epic game coming

1018
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:05,240
to the Xbox 360, as well as PlayStation 3, Unreal Tournament.

1019
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,720
One unique thing about this, and I think we mentioned this back on an earlier show, they're

1020
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,480
going to be allowing mods to be used on PlayStation 3 and the 360 version, probably as well as

1021
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,200
the PC.

1022
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:21,160
Of course, they're also going to be including user-created mods as well.

1023
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,840
So that's actually kind of cool, that they're allowing mods on there, because I know there's

1024
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,480
been some pretty good mods available for Unreal and Half-Life 2 and stuff.

1025
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,680
It'd be really cool to see some of the stuff downloadable online.

1026
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,520
Although no idea when this game's coming out.

1027
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,720
I like the idea of user mods coming out online.

1028
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,160
I mean, the only time I can think of user-created content outside of an MMO that I've seen on

1029
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,840
like Xbox, it would be like DDR Steps on ultraMix 2 through 4, whatever, have those steps you

1030
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,380
could download online.

1031
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:57,800
So you don't see a whole lot of user-created content, so that's kind of cool, I think.

1032
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:03,760
Also what's kind of cool, a Flash-based computer game called N, which I used to play religiously.

1033
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,200
It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1034
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,520
Describe N. I've never played N. What is N all about, Loki?

1035
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,360
N kind of has a stick figure, like ninja type of character that you run around collecting

1036
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,360
the gems.

1037
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,440
Oh God, I've watched you play this game before.

1038
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,440
I know what...

1039
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,000
Okay, sorry, keep going.

1040
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,600
So anyways, it's pretty awesome though.

1041
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,960
You just run around and you collect stuff and there's like, as the levels go on it gets

1042
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,640
harder and harder and there's like missiles and stuff you have to dodge and you just have

1043
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,520
to make it through the time limit and stuff.

1044
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,000
I've totally seen you play this game before.

1045
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,200
Okay, now I know what it is.

1046
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,000
Well, N Plus is coming out on Live Arcade later this year.

1047
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Will you be buying that?

1048
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yes.

1049
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Alright, very cool.

1050
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,840
Of course, who knows how long it's going to get delayed because by this time we were supposed

1051
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:49,200
to see Castle Crashers, but not that we're bitter or anything like the rest of you.

1052
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,400
Alright, let's go to the website of the week.

1053
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,120
Every week Dark Sakura climbs the internet up and down and back and forth and finds a

1054
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,080
website suitable of sharing with the rest of you and we call it Dark Sakura's website

1055
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,000
of the week, a website for you to visit besides orangelaungeradio.com.

1056
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:13,960
So Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers this week besides orangelaungeradio.com?

1057
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,800
The website of the week is the Castlevania Dungeon.

1058
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:24,480
You can get there by going to castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com.

1059
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,560
I will be, of course, reposting the link in the chat room which I have actually already

1060
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:35,320
done once today because I was posting links to images of the original Rondo of Blood.

1061
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:42,000
But if you go into the site, it has write-ups on every one of the games.

1062
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,400
The first thing that you see is actually a big screen print of the updated Rondo of Blood.

1063
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,880
There's artwork, multimedia, emulation, fan fiction.

1064
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,880
It's really cool.

1065
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,520
I've actually been going on this site in upwards of eight years now.

1066
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:07,880
It really is the, I'd have to say, most in-depth Castlevania site ever and really I can't say

1067
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,040
good enough about it.

1068
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,160
It really is up there.

1069
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:17,640
In fact, this site actually, if Dan told me right, inspired his site that he used to have

1070
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:22,440
back in the day which was Neo Strider's Strider's Own, if you wouldn't ever remember that.

1071
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,440
Nerds.

1072
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,440
I did his graphics form.

1073
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,040
This was partly my site too, but Castlevania invention is just fantastic.

1074
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,640
Kudos to the folks that run it.

1075
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,720
You guys have been just keeping it awesome for years and so cool.

1076
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,720
So go there.

1077
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,720
Now.

1078
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,720
I mean, after the show.

1079
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,360
Why am I not surprised the Castlevania site made it for her website of the week?

1080
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,640
Well, it was going to be history.com.

1081
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,400
Now you just gave away what next week was likely to be.

1082
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,320
No, next week isn't history.com.

1083
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,080
I am completely shocked.

1084
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,080
Completely shocked.

1085
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,080
That's what I thought.

1086
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:01,120
Anyways, there was some other weird news that managed to leak out this week.

1087
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:07,880
This website, DVD Empire, they were making big news about exiting the video game business

1088
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,720
and apparently gave their top eight reasons why they are leaving the game business.

1089
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,080
Now most people are like, who the fuck is DVD Empire?

1090
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:23,360
Well the only way I've heard of them before is because, well a couple of reasons.

1091
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:29,840
One, they're the legit side of adult DVD Empire, which is big on adult movies.

1092
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,080
The other thing is we actually sell to them, or we did at one time I guess because now

1093
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,080
they're out in the business.

1094
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:42,320
But I just thought it was interesting some of the reasons that they mentioned that they're

1095
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:47,580
leaving the game's business because it actually doesn't make any sense.

1096
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,200
And I don't think a lot of sites are covering this.

1097
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,560
Well let me just real quickly go down the list.

1098
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,040
Number one, video game industry does not care.

1099
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,000
The video game industry only cares about the mass emergence like Toys R Us, Walmart, Best

1100
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Buy, etc.

1101
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,640
They completely ignore the needs and wants of medium or small game retailers and below

1102
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,080
is how they do it.

1103
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,000
Well that's sort of true.

1104
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,960
I mean you're not going to be able to bring in a retail kiosk or anything like that if

1105
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,200
you're a small guy.

1106
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,600
You have to be doing a lot of business with them.

1107
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,560
They can't make money they say, which is funny because I have a lot of customers that do

1108
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,080
make money and lots of it, but whatever.

1109
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:28,360
You may not care whether or not we make money but we continue to pay to sell video games.

1110
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,120
Is impossible for us to make money selling video games.

1111
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:35,780
Video game manufacturers set the price using what they call MSRP and here's an example

1112
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,760
the video gaming industry greed.

1113
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,100
They set the retail price at $5 above product costs.

1114
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,880
Buy it for $54.99, sell it for $59.99.

1115
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,860
That is completely untrue.

1116
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:52,960
Their price, which I happened to after reading this, I looked it up, is way below that price.

1117
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:00,960
In fact, I think they were, at least for us, buying 6% or their discount was our cost plus

1118
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,040
6%.

1119
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,900
So they were actually paying 6% over what we paid for it.

1120
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,520
So they were still making tons of money on this stuff and there's never that type of

1121
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,920
margins on stuff at all.

1122
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,920
So I don't know what the fuck they're talking about there and they can definitely make money

1123
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,480
off of that stuff.

1124
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,400
They're also saying no price protection, games dropping price quickly.

1125
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,720
These guys used to buy one piece of different things at a time.

1126
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,820
So they wouldn't have a large inventory, that wouldn't even apply.

1127
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,840
No returns, that's all over the industry.

1128
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,120
They say distribution is dumb.

1129
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,280
I don't know who their rep was so that might be the case but they say basically that they

1130
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,480
get their product three days after street date.

1131
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,980
Well unless they are a big chain company, they won't get any product on street date

1132
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:50,400
because you have to be direct with the actual publishers in order to get stuff on street

1133
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
date.

1134
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,660
So they're just stupid.

1135
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,600
And better suited for brick and mortar retailers, that might be true but either way they're

1136
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,800
just bitching and moaning.

1137
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,800
Good riddance.

1138
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,920
Travis Donovan from our own Saturday Night Program here at Orange Lounge Radio says,

1139
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,160
I tried ordering from them back in 02 and it took three weeks to get my order and then

1140
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,680
it was wrong and then another month and a half to get what I ordered.

1141
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,040
All their games are now 20% off.

1142
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:21,640
I'm sure you were buying games and not porno, right Travis?

1143
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,360
The other thing too they were talking about here, there are some updates at the bottom

1144
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,520
of their little bitch page here.

1145
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,200
They have three different updates.

1146
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,800
One of them says, we knew about the low profit margins when developing our games division.

1147
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Why are you bitching?

1148
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,640
Why did they put up a bitch page in the first place?

1149
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,640
It's so retarded.

1150
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,640
It's kind of a professional.

1151
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,640
It's so retarded.

1152
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,720
And then the other one, people responded to our news with, well your model sucked, you

1153
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,400
should have sold these games and accessories.

1154
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:52,560
Let me put it this way, there are retailers and smaller guys that sell a lot more than

1155
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,640
you guys do and sure as hell, I don't know if we were their only distributor, but if

1156
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,320
we were, they weren't buying anything.

1157
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,120
They weren't hardly buying anything.

1158
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:07,040
They are just really whining and get out of the business.

1159
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,720
Well one thing I'm sure will be successful no matter how it's delivered to folks would

1160
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,280
be a Katamari Damacy online game.

1161
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,280
Get this.

1162
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:22,120
A Japanese gaming site called 4Gamer has reported that the Korean publisher WindySoft is bringing

1163
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,320
out Katamari Damacy online.

1164
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,900
It signed a contract in November of 2006 and Cyberstep has already begun development of

1165
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,120
the game, a late 2007 release.

1166
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:37,040
The gameplay of Katamari Damacy online is kind of like the versus battle from PS2 and

1167
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,680
PSP and now it's going to be in an online arena.

1168
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,720
There will also be community management features.

1169
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,560
There's going to be pet and house elements collectibles.

1170
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,340
You also supposedly can make your own island and create custom clothing from the items

1171
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,520
you get while playing.

1172
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,520
Very interesting.

1173
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,080
Hopefully, we'll see this on the US side, but if not, I'm sure a lot of people will

1174
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,860
figure out how to play it nonetheless because there's always the cult of people who want

1175
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,640
to play those games.

1176
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,140
We would like to take this opportunity to welcome your phone calls at this time by opening

1177
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,760

1180
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,780

1181
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,000

1184
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,360
So while we wait for some phone calls, do you have any last minute news, some real quick

1185
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,160
last minute news, anyone?

1186
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,400
Yes, real quick.

1187
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,080
A couple of things, there's some stuff being developed for the PSP, homebrew stuff.

1188
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:45,440
One of these is the Legend Zelda Quest for Link and actually looks kind of cool, kind

1189
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,040
of resembles the Super Nintendo Zelda, so if you want to check that, PSP Updates has

1190
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,680
the link for you.

1191
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,640
And then there's also one that looks like a cross between Zombies Ate My Neighbors and

1192
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:03,480
Biohazard 2 version 2.0 final has been released and yeah, it looks exactly like Zombies Ate

1193
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,560
My Neighbors.

1194
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,120
All right, let's go to some calls.

1195
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,200
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1196
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,200
Raven's Dolphin.

1197
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,800
Oh yes, you again, how are you doing Raven's Dolphin?

1198
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,600
I just got something to tell you about all games and you.

1199
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,600
Okay, what?

1200
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,600
You sounded tired.

1201
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,480
Well, it was 9.30 when I finally got through.

1202
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,240
It was 12.30 when I was over here.

1203
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,600
You know what, as well as that there was a lot going on here at the house, so I was kind

1204
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,680
of in my bedroom, like lying down, talking on the phone and what else should be said.

1205
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:41,060
Not to, again, I love all games, but their phone system, I don't know if it happens to

1206
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,880
you when you call in, but you hear yourself echoing and it totally bugs.

1207
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,880
Like I couldn't.

1208
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,880
Oh, I agree.

1209
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,880
It's not you.

1210
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,680
I couldn't hear anything they were saying, so it was tough.

1211
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,240
It hasn't always been that way because I've been on the show before and I didn't have

1212
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,240
that.

1213
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,920
But anyway, is that all you wanted to say?

1214
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,920
Yeah, two more things.

1215
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,920
Okay, what else?

1216
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,560
Sam & Max is great on GameTap, I've been enjoying myself with it.

1217
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,560
I freaking updated GameTap this week, meaning to play it, and then I got sucked into something

1218
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,560
else.

1219
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,560
I played one of their stupid arcade games.

1220
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,560
I know.

1221
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,560
I don't.

1222
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,160
Well, that too, but you know, some of the, because GameTap has like 800 games on it,

1223
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,920
so it's like you go there, I'm like, oh, I'm going to finally play Missed Online or Sam

1224
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,280
& Max, and then I'm like, holy shit, they put this game on there?

1225
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,760
I've totally got to play that game.

1226
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,240
So I think it was like Rainbow Islands or some crap.

1227
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,240
I know, ADD.

1228
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,240
I know.

1229
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,240
You're ADD.

1230
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,240
Yeah, there it is.

1231
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,240
You know?

1232
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,240
I do.

1233
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,520
I couldn't finish Hitman, and that made me mad.

1234
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,280
I wanted to finish it, and it made me mad.

1235
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,280
What else is on your mind?

1236
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:42,640
Okay, I have to tell you about the Mario Kart 64 thing.

1237
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,920
I have to tell you why.

1238
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,960
Why the Save Ghost thing?

1239
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:53,040
It's because the Wii, the emulator for the N64 doesn't realize that it's not an N64 before.

1240
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,960
It's running on a Wii, so it's thinking it's on an N64.

1241
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:02,000
That's what an emulator is, but it's thinking that it's an N64, and it's thinking that it

1242
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,520
has an N64 pack in it, but it thinks it needs that.

1243
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,320
It needs that, but in retrospect, it doesn't have it.

1244
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:14,520
I kind of sort of was implying that when I said that in order to make it work, they would

1245
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,040
have to go and recode the game itself, and that's a lot more than just trying to emulate

1246
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,040
it correctly.

1247
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,040
But you're right.

1248
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,360
They would have to recode the game to instead of looking for the memory pack, look for the

1249
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:32,560
Wii's memory, and that's not something that's easily done with a ten-year-old game.

1250
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:37,920
I know that other emulated sites like Project, I'm not going to say the rest, but they got

1251
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,400
through that, but the Wii, it's built up emulation.

1252
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,720
It's only going to pull what it thinks.

1253
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,680
The save states that are on the cartridge will work fine on the Wii.

1254
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,880
It's just those cartridge games might not.

1255
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,960
I do want to say this, though, I do agree that Nintendo definitely should use that patching

1256
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,720
feature to fix some of these things.

1257
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:03,540
Not so much the ghost thing, I could care less about that, but I would just love to

1258
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:08,400
see them give little bonuses, especially the multiplayer.

1259
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,520
Especially with the old-ass 8-bit games like Mario Brothers, how much more valuable would

1260
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,760
games like that be if we could play those online?

1261
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,760
Seriously.

1262
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,760
Just one more second.

1263
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:25,200
I thought the emulation was good on the N64, wouldn't you be pissed if you played Mario

1264
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,800
and it was off one millisecond?

1265
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,800
Yeah.

1266
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,840
Alright, that's all I have to say.

1267
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,200
I do want to say one other thing, though, about the emulation is that one thing, having

1268
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,840
the widescreen HD and everything, I noticed that the Xbox 360 is smart enough to put the

1269
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:44,140
vertical letterbox on my games when I'm playing something that's not widescreen, but the Nintendo

1270
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:49,200
Wii is not, and I really wish it was, and that is not a very hard fix.

1271
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,400
And yes, I realize I could dig up the TV remote and switch it that way, but it's so much easier

1272
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,200
when the system just does it automatically.

1273
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,600
I would love to see Nintendo make that little patch.

1274
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,000
You're right, and that's it.

1275
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,680
I want you to get another call.

1276
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,680
No problem.

1277
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,560
Thank you, Ravenstaufen, for your opinion, as always.

1278
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,360
He had his agenda tonight, and he has 123 agenda.

1279
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,360
Bravo.

1280
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,360
Good job.

1281
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,280
Welcome your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or the Skype line.

1282
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,680
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1283
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,680
Who's this?

1284
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,680
Hey, what's up?

1285
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,680
It's the Rob D.

1286
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,680
Hi, the Rob D. How are you doing?

1287
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,680
Not too bad.

1288
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,120
Well, actually, I'm a little bit sad, but it has nothing to do with anything other than

1289
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,200
the Super Bowl, so I'm from Chicago.

1290
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,640
We're not too big on the Super Bowl here, but I understand it was a big thing for folks

1291
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,640
around Chicago.

1292
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,600
I know one of our lesbians is from the immediate area around there and is a big Chicago fan,

1293
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,600
so I'm sure...

1294
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,720
I mean, she's in Wisconsin and is a Bears fan, so...

1295
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,400
Didn't she have cameras or something?

1296
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,960
I don't think so, but I was secretly rooting for the Bears for her sake, so I'm very sorry.

1297
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,200
I was rooting for the Bears simply because I was hoping they'd make another music video.

1298
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Super Bowl Shuffle?

1299
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,200
Yes, exactly.

1300
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,520
My favorite life in that is probably Now I'm As Smooth As A Chocolate Swirl.

1301
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,660
But you have to admit, and without getting too much further into sports, you have to

1302
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,320
admit that opening touchdown was hilarious.

1303
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,320
Yeah, definitely.

1304
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,320
Comedy gold.

1305
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,880
What's on your mind tonight, game-wise?

1306
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,640
Well basically, I have to talk about the whole ghost saving thing with a memory pack.

1307
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,640
Popular topic tonight, yes.

1308
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,640
What's on your mind?

1309
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:22,040
Well, I disagree that it has to do with hacking the game itself or altering the game itself

1310
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,040
in any way.

1311
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:27,760
I think that the emulator could be programmed to emulate a control pack itself, an older

1312
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,760
memory pack.

1313
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,760
I mean...

1314
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,760
I suppose...

1315
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,760
I don't know.

1316
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,960
I guess maybe I'm just thinking...

1317
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,080
The reason why my brain goes there is I'm thinking maybe it's just simply the way the

1318
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,680
data is written, or you're talking about different types of memory.

1319
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,680
I don't know.

1320
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,680
My brain...

1321
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,200
For some reason, I'm thinking in my mind it has to be the game that's recoded.

1322
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
I don't know.

1323
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,320
I wish Nintendo would be more open, but you know they're not going to tell us the specifics.

1324
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:52,360
Well, I'm just curious, since every PC emulator has figured out a way to get around save data,

1325
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,760
it would only take a little bit of ingenuity to get around it on the Wii.

1326
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,880
I suppose.

1327
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,320
But unfortunately, the Wii is so locked down when it comes to hacking and all that stuff.

1328
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,480
It's got to be Nintendo who does it, and I honestly don't think they care enough.

1329
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,000
I think they just want to start cranking out more virtual console games for us to buy.

1330
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,160
I think they want to get working on Pokemon Snap and whatever else on the 64 they're going

1331
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,160
to be bringing us.

1332
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,160
Ocarina of Time.

1333
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,160
All that crap.

1334
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,320
Yeah, it's not a big deal for Ghost Data.

1335
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,600
I never used it in the 64 version anyway.

1336
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,200
Yeah, I didn't have a memory pack, so it's kind of a moot point to me.

1337
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,880
I'm like, oh, well that's too bad I can't save Ghost Data, but then again, I'm barely

1338
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,400
playing this as it is because I have such bad gamer ADD.

1339
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:37,160
The other thing I'd like to comment on, though, is since Final Fantasy VI comes out this week

1340
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,760
for the Game Boy Advance, I think that's a great thing.

1341
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,080
I love Final Fantasy VI.

1342
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,440
It's my favorite Final Fantasy game ever.

1343
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,760
Terra's theme is quite possibly my favorite piece of music from any game.

1344
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,080
The opera is one of the best scenes in video games.

1345
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:59,520
It could be the best scene, but the opera scene is possibly the best scene in video

1346
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,940
game history, period.

1347
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:05,760
When I went to the More Friends concert a couple years ago before E3 and they reenacted

1348
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,640
that thing, like they had the actual opera singers, just chills.

1349
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,520
Even though the rest of the concert had sound glitches galore, that part was phenomenal.

1350
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,520
Phenomenal.

1351
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:19,720
But why haven't we seen a remake of Chrono Trigger?

1352
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,960
Didn't they touch it on the PlayStation 1 at least?

1353
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,960
They did.

1354
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,960
Final Fantasy Chronicle.

1355
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,960
Yeah.

1356
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,360
You know, it's kind of like, why doesn't Nintendo do a new Kid Icarus?

1357
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:33,680
It's kind of like, it squares little franchise that they're just kind of waiting for the

1358
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,420
right time on, I suppose, to really wow us with something.

1359
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,420
But yeah, that is kind of interesting.

1360
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,000
Why haven't we seen a Chrono Trigger type game on the PS?

1361
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,600
I wonder if the other part of it isn't Toriyama's stake in it.

1362
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Maybe.

1363
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:51,320
Toriyama is a really big name in art in Japan, so it could possibly be his own stake in it.

1364
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:56,120
Yeah, but what other RPG could it give me to care about an anthropomorphic frog?

1365
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,720
True.

1366
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,760
Maybe they'll add one in Final Fantasy 6.

1367
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,760
Battle Toads.

1368
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,720
Hey, what happened to Battle Toads vs. Double Dragon?

1369
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,400
Battle Toads was too fucking hard.

1370
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,400
Everyone gave up on it.

1371
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,260
Yeah, it took me forever to get through, but I did actually view that game, but that's

1372
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,260
a different story altogether.

1373
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,320
That's all I had to say, so I'll leave you to the rest of the show.

1374
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,320
No problem.

1375
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,080
Thanks so much for your insight, Rob D. We've been enjoying your chat comments tonight.

1376
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,080
Thank you.

1377
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,080
All right, take care, buddy.

1378
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,080
You too.

1379
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,080
Later.

1380
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,120
All right, let's go to another call right here on the line.

1381
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,360
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1382
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,360
Who's this?

1383
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,360
This is Brad from Pod Culture.

1384
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,360
Hey, Brad from Pod Culture.

1385
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,360
Hi.

1386
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,360
How you doing, buddy?

1387
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,360
Howdy.

1388
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,600
I'm short, I'm fat, and I'm going bald, but other than that, okay.

1389
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,560
Well, real life sucks, but that's okay.

1390
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,960
That's why we have the internet.

1391
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,280
What's on your mind, buddy?

1392
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,720
Not a whole lot.

1393
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,160
Just got a wee this week.

1394
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,160
Wee!

1395
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,360
I see your username comment says this, too.

1396
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,360
Wee!

1397
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,360
And I apologize.

1398
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,720
I got your message about the friend code, but I've been so horrible at adding it.

1399
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,360
I have like four people I have to add, so I will add you, I promise.

1400
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,640
Rob's not as bad as me.

1401
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,640
I've got like ten people waiting.

1402
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,640
I have a queue.

1403
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,120
That's no big thing.

1404
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,320
I'm more interested in playing with the me's more than anything else.

1405
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,640
I will send you my doctor.

1406
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,680
I will send you the goat say me.

1407
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,680
Somebody made me.

1408
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,680
It's disgusting.

1409
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,680
It's brilliant.

1410
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,680
Oh, Lord.

1411
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,680
I have Michael Jackson and the doctor.

1412
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,980
I think it was SSJ100Matt made it.

1413
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,240
It's a goat say me.

1414
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,240
It's hilarious.

1415
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,840
That's so wrong on so many levels.

1416
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,840
But funny.

1417
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:22,240
Anyway, what else is on your mind regarding the wee?

1418
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:29,320
Well, I got the Mario Kart 64, downloaded that today, and not only that, the problem

1419
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:34,240
with the ghost data, I was having problems with plugging in my GameCube controller and

1420
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,240
using it.

1421
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,920
Oh, because those games are optimized for the Wii Classic controller.

1422
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,400
I haven't tried the GameCube controller.

1423
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,720
What were the problems you were having?

1424
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,640
It's like the A button wouldn't work.

1425
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,640
And I know it's not the controller.

1426
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,440
I played that, played a NASCAR game on it the other day.

1427
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,640
Oh, boy.

1428
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,160
Well, do you think it's going to be worth shelling out the money for a Classic controller

1429
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,760
to get the optimized experience?

1430
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,440
Which I went and did.

1431
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,440
Did you really?

1432
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,440
Yeah.

1433
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,120
And did it play a lot better for you?

1434
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,600
Other than the fact that that controller itself sucks.

1435
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,560
You don't like the Wii Classic controller?

1436
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,560
No.

1437
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,040
What is it about it you don't like?

1438
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:19,840
I guess I'm being used to the Xbox controller or PlayStation.

1439
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,760
It's just the way that it fits in the hands.

1440
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,760
I see.

1441
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,240
It is a little – the thing that weirds me out about the controller is all the buttons

1442
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,760
on the top of it.

1443
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,440
Like there's an L button, an R button, and then like a little Z, and these other little

1444
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,440
nubs on it.

1445
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,320
And I'm like, there's too many buttons.

1446
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:40,040
Is it me or is the A and B buttons reversed from what they normally would be on the controller?

1447
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,560
I think they're right, but sometimes if you play a lot of Japanese games, they're

1448
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,360
usually backwards, and so that can kind of mess with you.

1449
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,280
It just seems like it's in a weird place.

1450
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,280
Yeah.

1451
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,960
And then what else was – oh, NintendoManiac64 says a Classic controller is needed for Super

1452
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:54,960
Nintendo games.

1453
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,840
I'd agree with that, because the GameCube had that funky layout for the buttons.

1454
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,040
I beg to differ.

1455
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,960
You don't – you use the GameCube controller on Super Nintendo games?

1456
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,640
The Hori pad.

1457
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,920
Hori made a GameCube controller that was in the Super Nintendo layout.

1458
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,400
Oh, so you're not really using a GameCube controller.

1459
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,400
I get it.

1460
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,400
Okay.

1461
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,280
If you're using a Classic controller, you've still got another way to do it.

1462
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,280
Okay.

1463
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,280
I didn't even think about a third party GameCube controller.

1464
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,840
And the fact that the Hori pads came out in the U.S. at major retailers, so.

1465
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,440
Oh, there you go.

1466
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,080
Good insight, DarkSucker.

1467
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,360
All right.

1468
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,080
So what other games have you been playing on your Wii, Bryce?

1469
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:36,680
I downloaded Super Mario Brothers and – what the hell else was the other one I downloaded?

1470
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,680
I downloaded two of them.

1471
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,680
Isn't it funny how you download all these games?

1472
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,680
R-Type.

1473
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,800
Are you going to download R-Type for Jamie?

1474
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,800
She sends me the Wii points.

1475
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,800
You know what?

1476
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,600
I'll go get you a Wii card if you promise me the first thing you download is R-Type.

1477
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,600
Oh, sure.

1478
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,000
You send me a Wii card, I'll download anything you want.

1479
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,520
Just wait until after I make my next school payment and I'll do it.

1480
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,520
Wow.

1481
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,520
Look at this, guys.

1482
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,520
Call in tonight.

1483
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,520
Jamie's giving away free Wii points.

1484
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,920
Only to my fellow Whovian.

1485
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,480
All right.

1486
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,480
It's like a contest.

1487
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,240
There's something nice about Dr. Who and Wii points.

1488
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,800
Send those emails to mailbag at orangefundstradio.com.

1489
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,400
I will send Wii points to whoever gets me a David Tennant signature.

1490
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,400
How's that?

1491
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,400
Oh, there you go.

1492
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,480
Actually, I could just do that with an envelope, but still.

1493
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,200
There you go.

1494
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,240
Zappy in our chat says, I love Dr. Who.

1495
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,240
Give me.

1496
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,240
All right.

1497
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,240
Brad, anything else on your mind tonight?

1498
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,240
Yeah.

1499
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,120
The DOA movie actually doesn't suck.

1500
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,120
Really?

1501
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,120
See, all I've heard is really negative things about it.

1502
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,080
So what – now, I know you reviewed it on your own program, but in a nutshell, what

1503
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,000
were your thoughts on it?

1504
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,160
It's complete popcorn.

1505
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,880
There's not a whole lot of – I mean, it's all substance, but are all –

1506
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,200
All style, no substance?

1507
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,200
Yeah.

1508
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,200
Yeah.

1509
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:57,520
Well, I mean, it's a fun summer movie kind of thing.

1510
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,000
It's just fun.

1511
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
It's not –

1512
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,080
So it's like – it's one of those movies where, like, turn your brain off for two hours

1513
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,160
and just kind of be a mindless zombie and it's not so bad?

1514
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,160
Oh, yeah.

1515
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,160
All right.

1516
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,160
That's cool.

1517
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,840
Why do you think it bypassed theaters?

1518
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:17,760
I really don't know because I've paid 10 bucks to see movies that are 10 times worse

1519
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,760
than that.

1520
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,760
That's true.

1521
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,820
I did pay to see Lady in the Water.

1522
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,840
Did you have the life – or is it – I'm sorry.

1523
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,440
Is it true in Dead or Alive movie that they have, like, life bars and the announcer in

1524
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,440
it?

1525
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,440
Yeah.

1526
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,020
Was that – that sounds cheesy.

1527
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,020
Was it cheesy?

1528
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:37,680
It's very cheesy in some places, yeah.

1529
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:43,160
Oh, well, I suppose you don't go see a Dead or Alive movie expecting Oscar-caliber Judi

1530
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:47,540
Dench acting-in-it type content, although it would be kind of funny if Judi Dench was

1531
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,280
in Dead or Alive, don't you think?

1532
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,280
I don't –

1533
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,280
What?

1534
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,280
Forget it.

1535
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,280
No.

1536
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,280
Not funny.

1537
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,280
All right.

1538
01:13:55,280 --> 01:14:00,800
Well, yeah, I hope they go to your program and check out the full review of Dead or Alive.

1539
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,800
All right.

1540
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,800
All right.

1541
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,800
Well, Brad, thanks so much for calling in tonight.

1542
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,160
We've got to go to another call, but take care, buddy, okay?

1543
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,160
Later on, man.

1544
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,160
Peace.

1545
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,160
All right.

1546
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,160
A little mini movie review here on Orange Launch Radio.

1547
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,640
Let's go to one more call.

1548
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,640
Hi.

1549
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,640
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1550
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,640
Who's this?

1551
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,640
Hey.

1552
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,640
Shadownextgen in chat.

1553
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,640
Hi.

1554
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,640
Shadownextgen in chat.

1555
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,640
What's on your mind, buddy?

1556
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:26,600
I apologize if you guys talked about this earlier as I was late to the show because

1557
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,600
of the Super Bowl.

1558
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,600
All right.

1559
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,680
A lot of people have that excuse tonight, but try me.

1560
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,680
What's up?

1561
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:37,600
Do you guys have any idea about what Konami's, quote-unquote, earth-shattering news tomorrow

1562
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,360
is going to be?

1563
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,360
You know what?

1564
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,840
We didn't bring this up, but I had read somewhere that they have earth-shattering

1565
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,840
news coming on Monday.

1566
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,840
It's on their own website.

1567
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,840
Yeah.

1568
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,840
They're advertising tomorrow.

1569
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,840
Earth-shattering news.

1570
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:55,400
And I saw that get picked up on Kotaku or Destructo or one of those sites.

1571
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,920
No, because they didn't tell us what it is on Thursday.

1572
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,240
I can guarantee you we talked earlier in the show about we weren't allowed to say some

1573
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,800
things for some time, but I can guarantee you everything that we were allowed to say

1574
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,800
has been said now.

1575
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,880
Here's the earth-shattering news.

1576
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,960
Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming soon.

1577
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,880
I have a feeling it's probably about one of the games we didn't see, like where was

1578
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,400
the Metal Gear Solid 4 info.

1579
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,440
You know maybe that's it.

1580
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:24,360
Maybe it's the Metal Gear Solid release date because don't you remember her saying

1581
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,880
something like, well, we want to give you the release date, but can we do that?

1582
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,880
No.

1583
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,280
Didn't she kind of do that kind of thing?

1584
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,840
Wasn't that how she was teasing the release date?

1585
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:36,800
Or was she just smoking a bowl?

1586
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,440
Doesn't she remind you just a little bit of what's-her-name from Nintendo, the parent

1587
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,440
Kaplan or whatever?

1588
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,440
I don't know.

1589
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:48,160
But anyway, I would say if it's that earth-shattering, it's the Metal Gear Solid 4 release date,

1590
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,880
new trailer, something like that.

1591
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,240
Something that missed Konami Gamer's Day for whatever reason.

1592
01:15:52,240 --> 01:16:01,600
A lot of people are thinking it's maybe Konami's confirmation of MGS4 on the 360.

1593
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:07,000
I have a feeling if that's going to happen, it's going to be a window where it's

1594
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,320
going to be on the PS3 for six months and then it'll come out on the 360.

1595
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,760
It might be like Virtua Fighter and just be Blade.

1596
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:18,880
Yeah, that's essentially what I'm getting at is that it might be one of those things.

1597
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,760
Because I'll tell you what, Sony needs that so bad right now.

1598
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:28,520
And you can kind of tell that Konami's really backing the PSP more than almost anyone else.

1599
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,600
Konami is doing what they can for Sony.

1600
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,180
So they still are in the business of making money, but I have a feeling they're going

1601
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,640
to give at least a window.

1602
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,160
I would not expect that to be tomorrow's news.

1603
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,160
But I could be wrong.

1604
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,160
That could be it.

1605
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:44,600
But I have a feeling you're going to get tomorrow the release.

1606
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,320
Unless it's something stupid, like remember the time when the guy got a lot of crap for

1607
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:53,840
this, but Joystiq had this big announcement at one o'clock about what Nintendo's doing.

1608
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,480
Yeah, and it turned out to be just some chip thing.

1609
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,120
If it's not something stupid like that, I would imagine it's the Metal Gear Solid

1610
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,120
release date.

1611
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,120
Oh my God.

1612
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:08,400
Big kudos to the Rob D. Metal Gear Solid 4 will star Sub-Zero instead of Raiden.

1613
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,040
I see what you did there.

1614
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,040
Funny.

1615
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,480
Well, what do you hope it is, Shadow Next Gen?

1616
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,360
Personally, like I said, I'd like to see Metal Gear on the 360.

1617
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,720
That would probably be for me.

1618
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:27,360
That way, one less reason for me to shell out $600.

1619
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,800
It would be bad news for Sony if that is what they announce tomorrow.

1620
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,640
Do you think Sony ought to just throw in the towel at that point?

1621
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:39,280
What can Sony do if they're about to lose Metal Gear Solid to the 360?

1622
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,760
I really couldn't tell you.

1623
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,960
Well, for one thing, they can start listening to their community like Microsoft does.

1624
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,960
Good idea.

1625
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:51,680
It seems like they keep telling us what we want instead of listening to what we want.

1626
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,680
That is true.

1627
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,460
They don't have anything quite like Major Nelson.

1628
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,460
You got to give that to Microsoft.

1629
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:59,840
I mean, Microsoft is by no means perfect, but at least they do have their outlet with

1630
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,840
their community.

1631
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,240
You got to admit, though, Nintendo doesn't really listen to people either, but somehow

1632
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,240
they get away with it.

1633
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:09,520
No, they don't, but I think they do a little bit better.

1634
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,840
But yeah, they could do better in that area as well.

1635
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:16,680
We seem to forgive Nintendo because they kind of at least deliver a little more than Sony

1636
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,360
seems to have been recently, I think is what it comes down to.

1637
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:23,600
Well, I think, personally, I think the reason why Sony has gotten so much f**k over the

1638
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,820
past year is just their PR.

1639
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:29,020
If they wouldn't have said half of their stupid comments, they'd probably be in a much better

1640
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,020
position right now.

1641
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,020
I would agree with you there.

1642
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:36,160
Like the time when people will buy a PS3 even if there are no games for it.

1643
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,080
I guess that's true.

1644
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,160
Well, we will see what that announcement is, and we'll talk about it next week.

1645
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,840
So shout out next year, and I'm hoping you'll call us back next week and let us know about

1646
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,840
the news, whatever it is.

1647
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,840
Yeah, all right.

1648
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,840
Jump through, guys.

1649
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,840
All right.

1650
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,840
Take care, buddy.

1651
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:51,840
Have a good one.

1652
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:52,840
Yeah, you too.

1653
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,840
Later.

1654
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,840
That's going to do it for tonight's Skyline.

1655
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,960
Thank you so much to all our people calling in, and I apologize if we didn't get to your

1656
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:58,960
call.

1657
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,880
We were getting hammered a lot there towards the end, but we just got to keep things moving.

1658
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:06,800
We're running a little late tonight, so we are going to go ahead and start to wrap up

1659
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,800
the show.

1660
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,800
Any last minute stories, guys?

1661
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,800
Yeah.

1662
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,800
All right.

1663
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,800
Yes, Loki.

1664
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,800
A few things.

1665
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,800
There's going to be a brand new wipeout.

1666
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:14,800
I know.

1667
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,800
This is a surprise.

1668
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:21,480
Brand new wipeout coming to the PS3 and PSP, and it actually looks pretty good.

1669
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:25,960
They have some screenshots up on that, you know, looks very similar to the other wipeout

1670
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:26,960
games.

1671
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,840
Apparently, Microsoft is bringing Project Silphied over here for Square Enix, so they're

1672
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,000
going to be publishing it stateside.

1673
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So that's kind of cool.

1674
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,480
I'm very much looking forward to that one.

1675
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:41,560
So we'll see the next-gen shooter on 360 soon.

1676
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:46,520
Rumors are that according to Famitsu, Resident Evil 5 is delayed to 2008.

1677
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:50,120
I definitely believe that.

1678
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,120
Let's see.

1679
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:57,000
Another rumor here, and this apparently was actually coming from, I want to say Bungie.

1680
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,840
Yeah, actually it was from their last Bungie update.

1681
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,440
They were saying that you'll be able to modify the gravity in, I believe, multiplayer games,

1682
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,840
so you can reduce the gravity to 50%.

1683
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,840
Oh boy.

1684
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,840
Jump even further.

1685
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,360
Hooray for low gravity games.

1686
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,360
You all know that's coming.

1687
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,280
Can I give some quick chat room comments to the last phone call here?

1688
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,560
NM64 says, Skye, I think Nintendo surprised their fans.

1689
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,600
Sony tells fans what they want.

1690
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:24,620
The Rob D says, that's because Nintendo doesn't act like arrogant jerks and piss all over

1691
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,800
our memories when they don't listen to us.

1692
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,760
Black Boy says, Nintendo totally doesn't listen to the consumers.

1693
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:31,760
Let's see.

1694
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,240
Hitstun says, Konami announces Boktai game for PS3, yeah.

1695
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,200
You have to drag your PS3 out into the sun.

1696
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,000
It might cook itself.

1697
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:47,160
Bandit says, breaking news, Konami's tears can cure cancer, if only it was able to cry.

1698
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,400
How random.

1699
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,880
How ripped off from the Chuck Norris.

1700
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:51,880
Yeah, I get it.

1701
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:52,880
I get it.

1702
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,880
Yeah.

1703
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:59,340
Anyways, there was also another rumored list of titles coming out for the Wii.

1704
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:05,600
This is supposedly from the new Game Pro issue, the March issue.

1705
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:11,880
On the list, we have 100 Bullets, which is supposed to hit in the fall, Alive, which

1706
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,440
is being done by Ubisoft.

1707
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:18,240
Remember, that's that one girl game thing that's supposed to make you cry and stuff.

1708
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,240
Oh, yes.

1709
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,240
Oh, yes.

1710
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,360
I remember that.

1711
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,000
A new Devil Kings game, which is very similar.

1712
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,640
It's Capcom's kind of Danksy Warriors type of game.

1713
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:34,240
A new Digimon game, DK Bongo Blast, I guess, is now coming out for the Wii.

1714
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,800
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, not a big surprise.

1715
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,400
Iron Man the movie game coming out in 2008.

1716
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:44,480
Kirby, a new Kirby game, 2007, I guess fall.

1717
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,760
Legend of the Dragon, I know Legend of the Dragon is coming out.

1718
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:53,040
Lost, they're supposed to be doing the game this year on that.

1719
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:58,840
Ratatouille, I know that's coming out, and that's actually not fall listed on here.

1720
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:04,720
Mario Kart for the Wii, Pilot Wings for the Wii, I don't believe that, but I guess we'll

1721
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,040
see.

1722
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:12,500
A new Wii shooting game and some new Wii Sports, Wii Motor Sports, they're going to have that

1723
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:15,000
airplane game that was shown in E3.

1724
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:22,240
Wii Music, which is supposed to come in October, TNA Impact, Jawa, which I have no idea what

1725
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:28,600
that is, Space Station Tycoon, Dance Factory, Animal Crossing, Raid Over the River, which

1726
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:39,640
actually looks pretty awesome, that's also coming out of the DS, and Sadness, we'll see.

1727
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:42,880
Jamie's still on the Castlevania kick, and now she's trying to get me into it too.

1728
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,280
Sorry, I found a YouTube thing where someone has uploaded apparently the entire run of

1729
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,280
the game.

1730
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,040
Real quick, because I know this makes for awesome radio, I wanted to show you, Rob,

1731
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:56,480
a game I liked, I know you like Burnout, well this is another game, Flatout, they have the

1732
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:02,920
first screenshots for Flatout Ultimate Carnage on xboxside.com, so I thought you might want

1733
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,960
to check this out, because it looks very similar to Burnout, and it looks very good.

1734
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,440
Wow, that's very pretty.

1735
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,760
It's like Burnout, but you can launch your driver through the windshield.

1736
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,160
That is great, I'm going to so play that.

1737
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,160
Hooray.

1738
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,160
Yeah.

1739
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:20,640
Alright, any other last minute news, Loki, Dark Sakura, anyone?

1740
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,600
Rondo of Blood is the best.

1741
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,600
Really?

1742
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,600
Yes.

1743
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,600
I never knew.

1744
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,160
I guess that means we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1745
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,720
I do want to say this, I usually don't tease what's coming up next week on the program,

1746
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:37,840
but next week, we have a juicy exclusive for you guys.

1747
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,240
One of our listeners, and I trust this person, has laid eyes on the script for the Alice

1748
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:49,880
movie, and we are going to be divulging a lot of details on the Alice movie that you're

1749
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,980
not supposed to know about right here on the program next week, so stay tuned for that.

1750
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:55,800
That's your teaser for next week.

1751
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,440
In the meantime, that means that's it, end of show.

1752
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,960
Thank you guys so much for tuning in, supporting independent radio, supporting Orange Launch

1753
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:02,960
Radio.

1754
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,960
You guys are awesome.

1755
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,960
We love you to bits.

1756
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1757
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:09,140
Loki, your final thought tonight?

1758
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:13,360
My final thought is I'm completely done with Microsoft's retail training.

1759
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,440
At least I'm caught up.

1760
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:19,920
By the way, chat room, yes, that is American McGee's Alice that we're talking about.

1761
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,720
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

1762
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:29,600
Richter Belmont, I'm sorry, Richter, I actually got a really freaking busy week ahead of me,

1763
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,840
so just, I need energy.

1764
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:38,480
My final thought is I want ice cream so bad right now, it hurts.

1765
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,000
I have ice cream.

1766
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,160
I want Baskin-Robbins or Cold Stone or something.

1767
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,240
I'm never eating it in and out again, by the way.

1768
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,240
Why?

1769
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,240
Did you read the nutritional content?

1770
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,240
Yes.

1771
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,120
Yeah, that's a good way to stop eating fast food like ever again.

1772
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:54,160
I love their fries, the 400 calories for all those tasty, beautiful potatoes.

1773
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,560
I can just make them at home in the oven and then they're like 200.

1774
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,560
All right.

1775
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,360
You're going to cut up a potato and put it in the oven?

1776
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,360
Yeah, I could do that.

1777
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,360
That's not bad.

1778
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,360
All right.

1779
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,360
That's it, folks.

1780
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,960
We'll be back next week with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

1781
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,880
Until then, hugs and kisses from us to you.

1782
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,880
Take care.

1783
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:11,880
