WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.440
And we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 221 for this February the 25th

00:25.440 --> 00:28.720
of 2007 and we are here with part B of our podcast.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.160
If it's your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you should dip back into our

00:32.160 --> 00:33.160
archives.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.160
Visit www.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:34.160 --> 00:39.100
You can hear the first half of the show where we talked about the virtual console and how

00:39.100 --> 00:43.000
Perrin Kaplan is always the introduction to the opposite sketch and much more.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.400
We even took some calls, which is a rarity for part A.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.920
So now we're going to get into part B, some more news.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.080
Dark Soccer is not here this week, but she'll be joining us for a tape segment in part B

00:51.080 --> 00:55.360
to do the mailbag because we always welcome your emails at mailbag.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.680
It is an interactive show.

00:56.680 --> 00:57.680
It's not just about us.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.280
I mean, we're just some schmoes on the internet like you.

01:00.280 --> 01:02.380
We want to always welcome you guys to interact with the program.

01:02.380 --> 01:05.800
We also have our chat room, hi chat room, waiting to interact with us.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.360
Also in part B tonight, Beat the Host.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.920
So Loki's looking forward to getting beat up a little bit.

01:10.920 --> 01:11.920
A little later on in the show.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.920
If they choose me.

01:12.920 --> 01:13.920
If they choose you.

01:13.920 --> 01:14.920
All right.

01:14.920 --> 01:21.400
Anyways, so apparently the rumor that Warhawk was going to be a download title is going

01:21.400 --> 01:22.760
to be true, I guess.

01:22.760 --> 01:31.720
According to 1UP's Sam Kennedy, he apparently just recently was shown by Incognito, the

01:31.720 --> 01:35.560
brand new Warhawk game, and it is going to be a download title.

01:35.560 --> 01:40.800
And a quote from him, what Warhawk is apparently evolved into is a multiplayer only title featuring

01:40.800 --> 01:44.920
ground and air combat that will be downloadable from the PlayStation Network.

01:44.920 --> 01:48.340
That's definitely not the Warhawk experience I'd imagined when I first saw the trailer

01:48.340 --> 01:52.720
two years ago, but that's not to say that I've lost excitement over it either.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.760
But for all I know, it could still be pretty freaking cool.

01:55.760 --> 02:01.640
It's just not what I expected.

02:01.640 --> 02:04.640
It's very interesting to see one of these titles that was supposed to be one of the

02:04.640 --> 02:12.680
flagship titles for Sony is now a kind of a tech demo that they're releasing now as

02:12.680 --> 02:16.880
a multiplayer game on the PlayStation Network.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.440
Is it really this title is that weak that it can't be released retail?

02:20.440 --> 02:25.240
Or is it just that the PlayStation Network doesn't have anything on it, or a combination

02:25.240 --> 02:26.520
of the two?

02:26.520 --> 02:28.520
Blaze doubts the truth behind this.

02:28.520 --> 02:32.120
Blaze in Chatham says 1UP is a tool of Satan, therefore they lie.

02:32.120 --> 02:36.440
Very true, but I would take it if they're going and actually visiting the studio that

02:36.440 --> 02:38.720
maybe this is the case.

02:38.720 --> 02:43.440
But then again, they haven't officially announced it yet, so I guess we can still call it rumor.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.440
Would you buy this?

02:44.440 --> 02:45.440
Nope.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.440
Downloadable?

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
At all.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.440
You know what though?

02:48.440 --> 02:49.440
I go, how much is it possibly going to be downloadable?

02:49.440 --> 02:52.320
It would have been 25 bucks, and then it would have been 60 bucks as a retail title.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.800
I'll have to see what the price is going to be on this, because I know one of the things

02:55.800 --> 02:58.480
that they're pushing is full downloadable games.

02:58.480 --> 03:04.080
So if they're just going to test the waters with Warhawk, it better be good.

03:04.080 --> 03:08.560
I'll wait and hear the reviews on it, and that will determine whether I purchase it

03:08.560 --> 03:09.560
or not.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.560
Because it's just like Qbert.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.640
Qbert's a downloadable title, and just because it's downloadable doesn't mean I'm going to

03:13.640 --> 03:14.640
buy it.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.040
It's crap, so I'll wait.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.160
Misty in our chat room says, aren't most game sites tools of Satan?

03:21.160 --> 03:22.160
Yeah, that's true.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.680
And actually, that gives me a chance to work in a plug for AllGames.com, where our show

03:25.680 --> 03:31.520
is rebroadcast every week, Monday nights at 5.30, unless they run long, which they usually

03:31.520 --> 03:35.600
do, and Pacific time, and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.900
AllGames.com actually endorsed by Satan himself, actually.

03:38.900 --> 03:39.900
So check it out.

03:39.900 --> 03:40.900
Hot.

03:40.900 --> 03:41.900
Hot, yeah, that's hot.

03:41.900 --> 03:42.900
Really.

03:42.900 --> 03:43.900
Literally.

03:43.900 --> 03:44.900
Whoa, yeah.

03:44.900 --> 03:45.900
All right.

03:45.900 --> 03:46.900
Do you care about Warhawk at All Rights Princess?

03:46.900 --> 03:49.100
I don't even know what the hell that is.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.800
They had it on PlayStation 1.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.480
It's like a biplane, like old shooting type game.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.480
I mean, you're into bi.

03:55.480 --> 04:01.940
It was done by the same people that did Twisted Metal, and it was one of those kind of air

04:01.940 --> 04:03.400
combat games.

04:03.400 --> 04:08.920
But it was one of the big things that they were showing off the six axis controller at

04:08.920 --> 04:14.760
E3, and I remember laughing my ass off when I saw the guy demoing it, and he barely landed

04:14.760 --> 04:18.960
this thing on the little landing pad, because the thing was like practically falling off

04:18.960 --> 04:23.320
of the landing pad, because he just sucked balls at actually using this.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.320
So that was kind of funny.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.320
I would have loved to see him like land it and the whole thing tip over and fall into

04:27.320 --> 04:31.480
the water, but alas, we can't always get what we want.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.480
All right.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.820
Well, some other PlayStation 3 news for you guys.

04:34.820 --> 04:39.000
If you guys have been kind of QQing over the fact that there's not a lot of, and I don't

04:39.000 --> 04:44.500
mean lining up, a lot of PlayStation 3 exclusives coming out, what's interesting is that they

04:44.500 --> 04:49.760
are going to be getting some exclusives for Spider-Man 3, which I believe is a Sony picture

04:49.760 --> 04:50.760
movie.

04:50.760 --> 04:51.760
Of course.

04:51.760 --> 04:52.760
I'm not mistaken.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.600
What's interesting about it is that Activision will be putting out a PlayStation 3 exclusive

04:56.600 --> 05:02.080
version of Spider-Man 3, but it's just the collector's edition that's exclusive.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.000
The game itself will still be out on other platforms, but with the collector's edition

05:06.000 --> 05:12.400
exclusive to the PlayStation 3, you get some webisodes for the Spider-Man 3 movie, an exclusive

05:12.400 --> 05:18.360
interview with the producer, behind the scenes talk with the dreamy Tobey Maguire and Topher

05:18.360 --> 05:26.200
Grace and James Franco, but oddly enough, Kirsten Dunst is not listed here, so she must

05:26.200 --> 05:31.400
have been a bitch and not done it, especially Spider-Man 3 trailers as well.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.800
As well as you get to play as the second Green Goblin in the game, there's going to be submissions.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.680
Thank you for ruining the next part of the story.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.680
Well, I thought you were done.

05:38.680 --> 05:39.680
No, I was not done.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.680
You paused.

05:40.680 --> 05:41.680
You were a long pauser.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.960
But I will say this, it also interfaces with the 6-axis controller.

05:45.960 --> 05:50.000
What, you don't care about Spider-Man 3, Eddie?

05:50.000 --> 05:54.880
No, but does the PlayStation 3 version exclusively suck?

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
I don't know.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.280
It's a little early to judge.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.600
It's going to be Spider-Man 3.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.680
Most of the Spider-Man games actually have done pretty well.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.680
Yeah, they're pretty good.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.800
Except for me, the last one, the Ultimate Spider-Man is kind of lame, but there's no

06:05.800 --> 06:08.720
movie coming out at the time.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.880
Alpha Canagram says, duh, the Spider-Man font is on the PlayStation 3.

06:12.880 --> 06:18.920
Well, that's just because they're just unoriginal, so they're going to use that.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.000
We can't think of a font for the PlayStation 3.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.480
Ah, fuck it, let's just steal it.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.520
It's our property anyways.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.520
So fuck them.

06:26.520 --> 06:35.800
Anyways, speaking of fucking over things, PlayStation 3 is going to be $1,000 in Australia.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.120
That's Australian dollars, of course.

06:38.120 --> 06:45.200
But that still equals up to $788 U.S. or 599 Euros.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.960
So yeah, that kind of sucks.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.160
Holy crap, mate.

06:51.160 --> 06:58.880
And apparently they say that it's the same price as the European PS3.

06:58.880 --> 07:04.080
It's just because the current exchange rate and the small population size of Australia,

07:04.080 --> 07:05.860
they're just going to get fucked over.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.040
Put another PlayStation 3 on the barbie.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.160
You hear those clicks?

07:10.160 --> 07:12.880
Those are all of our Australian listeners unsubscribing right there.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.320
You know what, though?

07:14.320 --> 07:18.320
The thing is, it may be more expensive, but you know what?

07:18.320 --> 07:23.200
They're going to be including Casino Royale with it, so I'm sure that will make up for

07:23.200 --> 07:27.960
the extra hundreds of dollars that you're going to have to pay for it.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.720
The other thing also, which is kind of good, there was a rumor going around that there

07:30.720 --> 07:36.740
was only going to be 11,000 units in Australia, which at that price point, I wouldn't be surprised.

07:36.740 --> 07:41.720
But apparently it is going to be more than that, so if you are waiting to get your hands

07:41.720 --> 07:46.280
on a PlayStation 3, just do what most of us are doing, just wait.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.720
Leave it to the chat room to be making the Australia comments.

07:49.720 --> 07:54.400
Mel B says, PS3, Australian for ripped off.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.360
Like the commercials for the beer, get it?

07:57.360 --> 08:02.120
And then Rama says, crikes, Australia's taking one up the arse.

08:02.120 --> 08:07.080
You have the worst Australian accent, period.

08:07.080 --> 08:12.000
My Australia sounds like a Scottish guy and my British sounds like an Australian guy.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.640
It all just kind of sounds the same.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.480
It's like your t-shirt dude slash straight guy, whatever.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.600
You just don't try very hard, do you, Rama?

08:18.600 --> 08:21.120
Look, I'm not on this show because I'm funny, okay?

08:21.120 --> 08:22.120
We know that.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
I don't know why I'm on this program.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.120
Yeah, we don't know either.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.120
I really don't know.

08:25.120 --> 08:31.640
Oh, I'm on this program to give release dates to you every week from Japan, where there's

08:31.640 --> 08:33.120
being made fun of of the Australians.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.360
Heck, why don't we just travel on over to Japan?

08:35.360 --> 08:39.960
Let's make fun of them, too, and their release dates for the upcoming week.

08:39.960 --> 08:46.080
Coming out, let's see, on March 1st for the PlayStation 3, Gundam Musou, God, is this

08:46.080 --> 08:47.600
the Gundam game we got here?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.000
No, Gundam Musou is even better.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Gundam Musou is...

08:51.000 --> 08:52.020
That's Mobile Suit Gundam, isn't it?

08:52.020 --> 08:55.440
It's Mobile Suit Gundam mixed with Dynasty Warriors.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.920
And there's a moose in it, too.

08:56.920 --> 09:04.280
Dynasty Gundam, where you're fighting hundreds and hundreds of AI retarded...

09:04.280 --> 09:05.280
That's a pass.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.280
Thank you.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.280
Robots.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.800
Let's see, what's coming out over on the Nintendo Wii?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.920
We have Densha de Go!

09:10.920 --> 09:12.800
Shinkansen EX.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.400
That's why you're on the show, Rob, to pronounce Japanese wrong.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
Thank you very much.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
It's great.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.840
This is a game where it looks like you simulate a train.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.840
It's a train sim.

09:20.840 --> 09:21.840
Yay.

09:21.840 --> 09:22.840
That should be fun.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.520
It's like a train on the Nintendo Wii.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.280
That'll be fun.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.800
Coming out on the PlayStation 2.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.800
You ready?

09:28.800 --> 09:29.800
Sure.

09:29.800 --> 09:30.800
Interlude.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.280
But that's moving into the best version, so that doesn't really count.

09:33.280 --> 09:37.280
Aku Daikan 3 is coming out.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
Sumimasen.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.680
I like this, because this is the best cover I think I've ever seen.

09:41.680 --> 09:46.880
Is that you have these real people, and there's this guy on the cover that's making this face

09:46.880 --> 09:47.880
like, huh?

09:47.880 --> 09:48.880
What do you want?

09:48.880 --> 09:49.880
He's like, I farted.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.880
You looking at me, bitch?

09:50.880 --> 09:53.780
I don't know what the hell type of game this is.

09:53.780 --> 09:54.780
It's a strategy game.

09:54.780 --> 09:56.800
I'm going to post the link there and chat room for those that want to see the cover

09:56.800 --> 09:57.800
of that game.

09:57.800 --> 10:02.520
That's one of my favorite covers I've seen in a long time.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.640
Let's see.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.240
What else do we have coming out over in Japan?

10:06.240 --> 10:13.720
On the Nintendo DS, a handful of games coming out, Super Robot Taisen W is coming out.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.720
Let's see.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.020
Oh, Disney Meteos is almost out.

10:17.020 --> 10:18.020
That's March.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.020
Disney Meteos?

10:19.020 --> 10:20.020
Oh, that's the US.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.020
Like Meteos?

10:21.020 --> 10:22.020
Never mind.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.020
That's March 5th in the US.

10:23.020 --> 10:24.020
Sorry.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.020
I'm not going to release any other release dates.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.020
That's all I got.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.020
Not a big week for releases in Japan.

10:27.020 --> 10:28.020
Darn.

10:28.020 --> 10:31.480
I'm also doing Euro release dates tonight, though, because Dark Soccer is not here, so

10:31.480 --> 10:40.200
let me quickly get them out getting out some release dates.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.520
Let's see.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.920
The Elder Scrolls on the PSP is slated for March 1st.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.280
Also slated for March 1st, Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.280
That doesn't sound right.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.480
I thought that game got hella delayed.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.280
You got hella delayed.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.800
That's interesting.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
What the hell?

10:55.800 --> 10:57.040
These don't even sound like legitimate release dates.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.400
They're talking about Resident Evil 5 on the Xbox 360?

10:59.400 --> 11:00.400
What?

11:00.400 --> 11:01.400
No.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.400
No.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.400
I think there's just some placeholders on this calendar here.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.400
Wrong.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.400
I would believe this, though.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.400
Yu-Gi-Oh!

11:06.400 --> 11:08.200
GX coming out on the 2nd for the PSP.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.200
That certainly seems legit.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.400
Still no one cares.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.440
Sonic and the Secret Rings for the Wii also on the 2nd.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
There you have it.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.440
Uh-huh.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.440
Awesome.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.440
Wait.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.360
Speaking of Resident Evil, is that on your agenda tonight?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.360
I don't think so.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.720
The Resident Evil 3 trailer came out for the movie?

11:23.720 --> 11:26.320
No, it definitely was not on the agenda tonight.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.320
Oh.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.320
Well, the trailer's out.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.320
And?

11:29.320 --> 11:30.320
So go watch it.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.320
It's called Resident Evil Extinction.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.400
It actually doesn't show a lot.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.400
It just kind of...

11:34.400 --> 11:38.660
You know how on one of the first two movies, they show the fake umbrella commercial where

11:38.660 --> 11:44.600
it's the face stuff or whatever, and if you've seen the cosmetic thing, whatever, it was

11:44.600 --> 11:45.600
kind of like that.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.080
They're like, we just don't even want to try anymore.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.080
Yeah, kind of.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.040
But I'm still going to see it because I like Resident Evil.

11:51.040 --> 11:55.880
Rob D.'s making fun of me in chat saying, March 2007, Duke Nukem Forever coming to the

11:55.880 --> 11:56.880
Wii.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.880
Screw you.

11:57.880 --> 12:01.880
ActDeaf says, Resident Evil 3 was filmed in my city.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.920
So you live in Raccoon City?

12:05.920 --> 12:08.440
Are there a lot of raccoons?

12:08.440 --> 12:10.480
Okay, yeah, so that's it.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.600
That's all I wanted to say.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.760
Let's get some definite for sure release dates, Loki.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.760
Wait.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.280
Well, nothing's ever definite for sure.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.680
I shouldn't try and fill in for Jamie.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.240
I just shouldn't.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.160
Let's see, some exclusive stuff real quick, and this isn't all that great.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.360
It's already been announced, Command & Conquer 3 for the 360.

12:28.360 --> 12:32.120
It is coming out now, though, May 9th, so that's kind of cool.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.480
Definitely needs some more real-time strategy stuff.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.320
This one's kind of interesting, but not too exciting.

12:37.320 --> 12:41.400
Backyard Football 08, and this is one of those franchises.

12:41.400 --> 12:47.620
It's the only kid franchise for sports games, and it is coming to the Wii and PlayStation

12:47.620 --> 12:54.280
2, but that's all the way in September 27th.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.520
Definitely a budget Atari title that they keep putting out each year.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.120
Arioma says Backyard Football is the best ever.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.920
Okay, well, there you go.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.920
The best ever.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.680
I'll stick with that.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.120
Anyways, this week, though, we've got some good stuff coming out.

13:08.120 --> 13:13.520
On the 360, we have Bullet Witch, which is going to be pretty awesome, and if you're

13:13.520 --> 13:17.080
definitely looking for some scantily clad witches fighting demons.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.680
Oh, that's perfect.

13:18.680 --> 13:22.520
And I do believe that there is a download where you can get a schoolgirl outfit for

13:22.520 --> 13:24.840
her, so that's awesome.

13:24.840 --> 13:29.520
Also on the 360, Dance Dance Revolution Universe, finally making its way out, and I'm picking

13:29.520 --> 13:30.520
this up.

13:30.520 --> 13:31.520
I can't wait to try it out.

13:31.520 --> 13:36.120
Of course, I'm not going to be able to use a dance pad, but, you know, upstairs apartment

13:36.120 --> 13:38.320
and all.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.800
Samurai Warriors 2 Empires.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.760
Okay, shit, I'm buying it anyway.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.760
Listeners can deal.

13:42.760 --> 13:45.680
If I have to hear them practicing guitar or piano or whatever they have down there, they're

13:45.680 --> 13:47.560
going to hear me playing DDR.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.560
Like it!

13:48.560 --> 13:53.680
Samurai Warriors 2 Empires, coming out on the 360 and Playstation 2.

13:53.680 --> 13:57.480
If you're even remotely interested in this, it's basically the same damn game that came

13:57.480 --> 13:59.360
out in September.

13:59.360 --> 14:05.960
On the Playstation 2 as well, MLB 2K7, that is also coming out on the Xbox, the 360, Playstation

14:05.960 --> 14:11.440
3, and I believe the PSP, so if you need some baseball, you can get there.

14:11.440 --> 14:16.560
Otherwise MLB 07, the show, is also coming out on Playstation 2.

14:16.560 --> 14:21.400
On the Wii, we've got SSX Blur, which, you know, SSX is an awesome snowboarding game,

14:21.400 --> 14:23.360
so definitely check that out.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.780
Playstation 3, you've got Formula 1 Championship Edition, if you're a racing fan, you might

14:27.780 --> 14:28.780
like that.

14:28.780 --> 14:35.480
On the PSP, Chilli Con Carnage, which is, I believe, Total Overdose on the PSP now,

14:35.480 --> 14:42.640
and 300 March to Glory, a PSP game based on the upcoming Frank Miller movie and comic.

14:42.640 --> 14:49.800
Finally, also on the PC, we've got Jade Empire Special Edition, which looks pretty cool.

14:49.800 --> 14:59.040
Also Sims 2 Seasons, you know, expansion pack for Sims 2, and I do believe that is it.

14:59.040 --> 15:05.640
Oh, I think Luminous Plus might be coming, no I think it already came out, I can't remember.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.160
That's moved around so many times.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.000
I think it did, because DMM mentioned it when he called in earlier.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.160
Yeah, but I think Source got it early, so they might have broken street on it.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.640
I'm almost positive I saw it at a game stop like two months ago, but as much as I love

15:17.640 --> 15:19.180
Luminous, I'm not buying it again.

15:19.180 --> 15:24.720
I have it on PSP twice, I have it on 360, I don't need it again.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.720
Really I don't.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.720
It's a good game.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.960
It's good, but it's not, you know, freaking buy it four times good.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.560
And of course, you know, on Virtual Console, though, you've got, what is it, Ocarina of

15:32.560 --> 15:39.880
Time coming out, so if you want to purchase a game virtually, you can go ahead and do

15:39.880 --> 15:40.880
that.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.880
Yeah, because I don't already have the GameCube disc and the version.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.400
How many times have they released that game?

15:47.400 --> 15:48.400
Too many.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.400
Yeah.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
All right.

15:50.400 --> 15:56.320
Anyhow, speaking of buying things, one of the places very popular for folks to buy games

15:56.320 --> 15:57.320
at is Circuit City.

15:57.320 --> 16:02.280
Well, what's interesting about this is that Circuit City is testing a new program online

16:02.280 --> 16:04.440
and at select stores.

16:04.440 --> 16:09.000
They are now dabbling in used game sales, so it looks like they want to start competing

16:09.000 --> 16:11.280
with places like GameStop.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.240
Of course, this means, you know, games are usually selling about five dollars cheaper

16:14.240 --> 16:15.640
than they usually do.

16:15.640 --> 16:19.160
The prices, it appears, according to reports, are about the same that you would see at a

16:19.160 --> 16:20.960
GameStop.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.400
But of course, Circuit City wants a piece of that billion dollar market, apparently,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.160
that GameStop EB Games has.

16:26.160 --> 16:30.360
I think a little competition for GameStop would be a healthy thing, so I totally support

16:30.360 --> 16:31.360
this.

16:31.360 --> 16:35.080
Although, I have to admit, I don't usually shop at Circuit City, but maybe that's part

16:35.080 --> 16:36.880
of another reason they want to do this.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.760
Maybe they'd like to get their foot in the door a little more with games, so I welcome

16:39.760 --> 16:41.200
the price competition.

16:41.200 --> 16:46.120
I don't think GameStop could buy Circuit City very easily like they did EB Games and whatever

16:46.120 --> 16:49.360
else they've been buying lately, so I think this will be a good thing.

16:49.360 --> 16:54.680
Yeah, it is a good thing as long as they don't kind of go along the same lines of their ads

16:54.680 --> 17:00.880
and coupon policy, which means that, well, for example, there was a situation that happened

17:00.880 --> 17:01.880
last month.

17:01.880 --> 17:06.560
Circuit City had a flyer that ran an ad which promised to save you up to forty dollars when

17:06.560 --> 17:08.840
you buy your Wii with them.

17:08.840 --> 17:12.800
It says as long as you visited the website, printed the flyer, went to the shop, they

17:12.800 --> 17:14.480
give you the discount.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.480
Later on, though, they said they'd take it all back.

17:16.480 --> 17:20.280
They said the discount actually comes with a statement qualifying purchases excluding

17:20.280 --> 17:24.880
gaming hardware and took the coupon off the site completely.

17:24.880 --> 17:30.800
But apparently people went to the store and wanted the discount and they couldn't get

17:30.800 --> 17:31.800
it.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.920
Then, of course, they complained to the Better Business Bureau and so on and so forth.

17:35.920 --> 17:44.320
The response was apparently the Better Business Bureau received a ton of responses for it.

17:44.320 --> 17:52.040
One of the things they basically got from Circuit City was that they reserve the right

17:52.040 --> 17:58.680
to make changes to advertisements and coupons, et cetera, whenever they want.

17:58.680 --> 18:03.800
Where they can print out, you can have a coupon for forty dollars off of a system or something.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.600
They can go ahead and bait and switch.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.080
Huge comments from Chat Room on these two topics.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.360
Joshi16 says, Circuit City will give up, me thinks.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.840
Shadow Charlie says, Circuit City, they can go fuck themselves.

18:14.840 --> 18:18.320
DDR Dollar Bill says, Circuit City will fall soon.

18:18.320 --> 18:22.280
Blaze says, Competition for GameStop is important because there is little competition out there.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.560
James Patrick says, GameStop killed EB Games.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.200
I hate them for that.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.040
Hitstun says, I'm starting to really miss Funkoland.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.680
That made a lot of people go, Funkoland!

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
Funkoland was awesome!

18:31.680 --> 18:34.280
The way you say it's funny, like Funkoland.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.160
Hey, it's exactly like it's so funky.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.080
It's got a lot of funk to it.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.080
Funkoland.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
All right.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
Yeah.

18:42.080 --> 18:47.200
So we have some other stuff coming up in this segment, including Beat the Host.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.660
And of course, we need to find a worthy competitor to play Beat the Host tonight.

18:50.660 --> 18:56.460
So if you want to guess some arcade retro classics here with us, we're going to be asking

18:56.460 --> 18:59.040
a question here very soon.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.440
But we have a couple more stories for you first.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.360
And that is this one, which I think is very interesting.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.120
Apparently, Dig is trying to trademark its name.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.120
You know Dig.com?

19:09.120 --> 19:10.120
D-I-G-G.com.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.080
They're trying to trademark their name.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.080
And let me work in a cheap plug.

19:14.080 --> 19:17.140
If you would, Orange Lounge Radio is on Dig.

19:17.140 --> 19:21.920
And we used to be on the first page, but WC Radio really kicked our butt.

19:21.920 --> 19:22.920
Thanks.

19:22.920 --> 19:23.920
Thanks for that, Speedy.

19:23.920 --> 19:24.920
No, just kidding.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.800
But a lot of shows are kicking our butt there on Dig, including the Corpcast.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.260
So we need help.

19:30.260 --> 19:33.240
So if you would like to Dig our show, head on over to Dig.com, click on Podcast, search

19:33.240 --> 19:34.240
Orange Lounge.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.240
You'll find us.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.240
Give us a Dig.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.240
I'm sure somebody will post a link in chat.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.740
We could also use reviews on iTunes.

19:38.740 --> 19:39.740
And I'll tell you what.

19:39.740 --> 19:43.280
We actually had two people post reviews last week, so the OLR is the festering rash of

19:43.280 --> 19:44.280
internet radio.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
Awesome.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.280
Awesome work.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.640
And then UNI made a more serious review.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.640
Awesome work, people.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.960
I'm so proud of the OLR me.

19:49.960 --> 19:52.280
So we definitely need more Digs and more reviews.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.840
Anyhow, so you know Dig, the social networking site.

19:54.840 --> 20:00.640
Well get this, apparently LucasArts is trying to interfere with this trademark.

20:00.640 --> 20:08.000
They have actually put in an injunction or whatever, filed an opposition, shall we say,

20:08.000 --> 20:12.120
because they had a game in 1995 called The Dig.

20:12.120 --> 20:17.560
And because Dig has a gaming page and you have this game called The Dig, LucasArts says

20:17.560 --> 20:18.560
it's too confusing.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.560
But what?

20:19.560 --> 20:21.960
It's not even spelled the same way or anything.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.000
Like that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
That is terrible.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
It's pretty bad.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Apparently it is spelled the same way.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Is it The Dig?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
No.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Because this is D-A-G-G and The Dig is just like a Dig.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
No, the game was The Dig.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.720
Well I forgot that The Dig even existed.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.180
Me too.

20:36.180 --> 20:38.880
How could you forget it was such a good game?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.580
I don't know.

20:40.580 --> 20:42.080
That's stupid.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.080
Stupid LucasArts.

20:43.080 --> 20:52.600
It's all George Lucas' fault because he makes crappy fixes to his Star Wars movies.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.720
So speaking of putting the blame on others.

20:56.720 --> 20:59.360
Wait, I have to say this.

20:59.360 --> 21:03.320
Speedy in chat says Dig Dug should sue.

21:03.320 --> 21:04.320
That's true.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.600
If The Dig can sue, why can't Dig Dug?

21:06.600 --> 21:09.440
Why doesn't Dig Dug sue The Dig?

21:09.440 --> 21:11.400
When you dig stories, don't you say Dug It?

21:11.400 --> 21:12.600
Like it says, hey, you dug it.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.600
Hey man, I dug it.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.600
Yay.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
You know what?

21:15.600 --> 21:16.600
Namco, get on that.

21:16.600 --> 21:24.760
I think like grave robbers and those guys should sue people too.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.840
That's it.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.840
Sorry.

21:27.840 --> 21:28.840
That was stupid.

21:28.840 --> 21:29.840
No, I'm really sorry.

21:29.840 --> 21:30.840
I interrupted Loki.

21:30.840 --> 21:31.840
I know.

21:31.840 --> 21:41.760
They were at a Seattle, Washington news station and unfortunately, they're retarded but KOMO

21:41.760 --> 21:50.880
TV, they reported on the sexual predators that are on Xbox Live and they're blaming

21:50.880 --> 21:55.160
Xbox Live for apparently people.

21:55.160 --> 22:00.600
Remember this whole story with the kid getting kidnapped and they apparently had some pictures

22:00.600 --> 22:02.160
on live or something like that?

22:02.160 --> 22:07.280
Anyways, they're documenting this 13-year-old boy playing Gears of War which that right

22:07.280 --> 22:09.400
there is a mature rated game.

22:09.400 --> 22:13.320
Parents obviously not paying attention to what this kid is doing.

22:13.320 --> 22:18.200
Thank you by the way, case in point, I think this makes the whole story a piece of shit

22:18.200 --> 22:22.040
right there that they taped a 13-year-old playing Gears of War when it says clearly

22:22.040 --> 22:25.000
right there on the label, it's a mature game.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.060
Anyways though, it says a parent is helpless to do anything and a grown man playing the

22:30.060 --> 22:37.600
Lolita character for game points and that basically went on to talk a little bit about

22:37.600 --> 22:38.600
it.

22:38.600 --> 22:43.200
It's all sensationalism basically but they were also talking about how there's no way

22:43.200 --> 22:50.160
that the parents have to be online or with their kids I guess or something in order for

22:50.160 --> 22:54.280
the parental blocking to work or something.

22:54.280 --> 22:59.220
Either way, it was one of those stories done by a local station for ratings that obviously

22:59.220 --> 23:04.400
had no facts whatsoever regarding the subject and of course everybody jumps on it like you

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
know crazy.

23:05.400 --> 23:10.760
Hey baby, why don't you come over here and I'll show you the size of my Xbox Live points

23:10.760 --> 23:11.760
card.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.640
Oh yeah.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.920
That was terrible, Rom.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.280
And so is the story.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.280
I know.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.280
Whoa, don't yell at me.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.760
Oh, I concur with you.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.560
This has to be, I have to laugh at this.

23:22.560 --> 23:30.360
This is also, they have a picture from Fancy Star Universe which it says right here, 500

23:30.360 --> 23:35.080
for pics, 1,000 for nude cam show.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.560
Oh my God.

23:36.560 --> 23:40.360
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, want to see my gamer score?

23:40.360 --> 23:41.880
Oh gosh.

23:41.880 --> 23:46.680
It says people are from Ohio, Kansas and I'm from Washington.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.560
You can just talk to each other really clear.

23:49.560 --> 23:54.280
I've met other people as far away as Russia and then it says the parents are talking about

23:54.280 --> 23:55.280
it.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.280
We're really concerned.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.000
Our problem is parents don't see this as a threat yet.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.440
Of course they're not paying attention to what their kid's doing.

24:02.440 --> 24:08.240
Anyways, you've got to check out the article, it's hilarious, comotv.com slash news slash

24:08.240 --> 24:14.400
5983826.html or just probably just search on the website and you'll find online gaming

24:14.400 --> 24:16.520
world as a forum for sex predators.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.920
That's the story article but it's funny.

24:19.920 --> 24:20.920
Hey Rob.

24:20.920 --> 24:21.920
What?

24:21.920 --> 24:26.560
You want to come over and see my huge stiff boner?

24:26.560 --> 24:32.520
Actually, coming from a woman, I kind of would like to see how you're going to pull that

24:32.520 --> 24:33.520
off.

24:33.520 --> 24:39.520
Okay, 500 for pics, 1,000 for live webcam action, whatever the fuck it's in.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.880
Okay, here's another one right here.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.920
They're talking about apparently this kid Adam.

24:44.920 --> 24:51.320
I think this is a 13 year old they're talking about, his mother Karen Epstein.

24:51.320 --> 24:56.840
She does not know about the feature, the blocking features on Xbox Live.

24:56.840 --> 25:02.320
When she opened Adam's online account, she handed him over the setup so that he can do

25:02.320 --> 25:05.400
all the setup stuff for the account.

25:05.400 --> 25:11.720
Okay, well apparently this parent is just stupid because she's handing over this stuff

25:11.720 --> 25:17.400
to her kid and letting him get in basically all this trouble and stuff and to be honest,

25:17.400 --> 25:21.400
if you're really that concerned about your kid, and to be honest, I don't think she even

25:21.400 --> 25:24.880
knows that there's a threat out there with this stuff until the news person says, did

25:24.880 --> 25:27.600
you know your kid can get raped from Xbox Live?

25:27.600 --> 25:31.960
Then she's like, whoa, what the fuck?

25:31.960 --> 25:36.240
In related news, according to that one news story we talked about a couple months ago,

25:36.240 --> 25:38.600
PictoChat is raping children everywhere.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.600
Did you hear about this?

25:40.600 --> 25:45.760
I'm going to start using PictoChat now.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.560
Rice Princess is horny.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
Whatever.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.960
You can't rape the willing Rice Princess.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
This is true.

25:51.960 --> 25:52.960
All right.

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
Hey little boys.

25:53.960 --> 25:54.960
No, I'm just kidding.

25:54.960 --> 25:55.960
All right.

25:55.960 --> 25:56.960
Oh God.

25:56.960 --> 25:57.960
Wash my brain.

25:57.960 --> 25:58.960
Never be clean.

25:58.960 --> 25:59.960
Never be clean.

25:59.960 --> 26:00.960
All right.

26:00.960 --> 26:01.960
Anyhow.

26:01.960 --> 26:02.960
I don't feel yourself.

26:02.960 --> 26:03.960
Here it is kids, tonight's question.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.960
The first one to send this in a private message to me in the chat room gets to play beat the

26:06.960 --> 26:11.120
host tonight and you have to be willing to use Skype or call our 800 number to be a part

26:11.120 --> 26:12.120
of the game.

26:12.120 --> 26:16.480
Now, tonight's topic is classic gaming, right?

26:16.480 --> 26:20.520
The question is, if you're a classic gaming expert, this should be no problem for you.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.600
On what board number does Pac-Man crash?

26:23.600 --> 26:25.640
That is on what board number does Pac-Man crash?

26:25.640 --> 26:26.640
There you go.

26:26.640 --> 26:30.040
I posted it on the chat room, so if you know your classic games, you know what I'm talking

26:30.040 --> 26:31.040
about.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.040
There it is.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.040
All right.

26:33.040 --> 26:38.400
Now, controversial stories like our last one always generate a lot of emails and we always

26:38.400 --> 26:42.760
get a lot of good emails to our mailbag at orangelanatradia.com and through the magic

26:42.760 --> 26:48.440
of the space-time continuum, Dark Sacra is here tonight to read us our emails.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.120
Hi Jamie.

26:51.120 --> 27:02.040
Yo, this is the voice from beyond who isn't here because of family business.

27:02.040 --> 27:06.760
Here is the mailbag and the first email comes from some guy...

27:06.760 --> 27:11.000
Thank God I'm here too to interrupt you because it just wouldn't be a mailbag segment if I

27:11.000 --> 27:12.560
couldn't talk too damn much.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.880
Rob, I hate your Mac.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.000
Hey, bring your own laptop next time.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
B-Y-O-L 24 for you.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.120
Hey, I was going to give you a free massage, so bite me.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.120
Massage my butt.

27:22.120 --> 27:25.160
No, I'm not into the glute massage, sorry.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.840
Massage my middle finger right there.

27:26.840 --> 27:27.840
I massaged Christopher's.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.840
Did you?

27:28.840 --> 27:29.840
Yes.

27:29.840 --> 27:30.840
All right.

27:30.840 --> 27:31.840
Good to hear.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.840
This email comes from some dude named Mark.

27:33.840 --> 27:38.080
God, why can't people just be patient?

27:38.080 --> 27:42.320
Anyway, I'm sorry to say, but the standard of your show the last couple episodes has

27:42.320 --> 27:44.240
seriously gone downhill.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.280
It's becoming less of a show about video games and more about your social lives.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.600
There seems to be a lot of hideous screaming and yelling.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.160
It's really crossed the line of unprofessional.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.360
Hey, Jamie.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.360
I got to fart.

27:54.360 --> 28:00.800
I think if Sky kept on topic and I know he tries, the show would go for half the time.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.520
That's kind of funny because usually people are like, do more.

28:03.520 --> 28:04.520
Okay.

28:04.520 --> 28:05.880
Well, it's been a polarizing thing.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.760
Some people with the last couple episodes have been like, oh my God, this has been like

28:08.760 --> 28:11.480
the funniest things you guys have ever taped, and some people-

28:11.480 --> 28:12.480
Let me finish the email.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.480
All right, fine.

28:13.480 --> 28:18.160
I also listen to the video game show and gamer cast network, which both have the right balance

28:18.160 --> 28:19.800
of humor and information.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.760
It's a shame because I love hearing about Dark Sakura's obsession with collection.

28:22.760 --> 28:23.760
You do.

28:23.760 --> 28:29.800
In Loki's tech news, even when he gets so angry, he fumbles his words, LOL, but I don't

28:29.800 --> 28:32.920
have the time and patience to sift through the nonsense to get the info I need.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.920
He didn't say he unsubscribed.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.400
I thought I said he unsubscribed.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.400
No.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.400
Whatever.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.960
The patience isn't spelled like... You spelled patience like-

28:40.960 --> 28:44.760
See, now you're just being a bitch to him because he had something negative to say about

28:44.760 --> 28:45.760
the show.

28:45.760 --> 28:46.760
No, no, no, no.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.080
I'm just pointing out for future reference that the type of patience that you spelled

28:49.080 --> 28:50.080
belong in a hospital.

28:50.080 --> 28:51.080
Oh my God.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.080
Okay.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.080
So to get back-

28:53.080 --> 28:57.480
You too can send us an email and get your spelling and grammar berated by Jamie live

28:57.480 --> 29:00.320
on the air and you wonder why people unsubscribe from the show.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.320
He didn't unsubscribe.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.320
He didn't say he unsubscribed.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.320
Sorry.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.320
Well, he didn't say he stopped listening, though.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.320
No.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.320
He didn't say he stopped listening.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.320
Well, hopefully-

29:07.320 --> 29:08.320
This is a shame.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.840
Well, he's going to really unsubscribe now.

29:09.840 --> 29:10.840
No.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.560
I'm saying that out of the kindness of my heart.

29:13.560 --> 29:14.560
You know what?

29:14.560 --> 29:15.560
Yeah.

29:15.560 --> 29:16.560
We kind of agree.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.560
Really?

29:17.560 --> 29:18.560
Are you unsubscribing from the show too?

29:18.560 --> 29:19.560
Fuck you.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.560
No.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.880
Is that why you're not here tonight?

29:21.880 --> 29:22.880
No.

29:22.880 --> 29:25.080
I'm going to my grandfather-in-law's birthday party.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.080
Yeah.

29:26.080 --> 29:32.200
I'm a firm believer in family values as in I believe in the value of... Never mind.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.200
Sorry.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.200
You're getting off topic.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.200
We need to talk more about games.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.640
Is this about a video game?

29:36.640 --> 29:37.640
Is your grandpa a video game?

29:37.640 --> 29:38.640
I don't think he is.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.640
He's not my grandpa.

29:39.640 --> 29:40.640
Well-

29:40.640 --> 29:41.640
All right.

29:41.640 --> 29:42.640
You say your piece also.

29:42.640 --> 29:43.640
Okay.

29:43.640 --> 29:47.400
Anyway, I think, yeah, to a degree, it's gotten a little bit crazy, but you know, those like

29:47.400 --> 29:51.200
how the shows used to be back in the day and I think it's kind of fun to let loose and

29:51.200 --> 29:59.800
be kind of silly once in a while because really ratings state other than what you just said.

29:59.800 --> 30:04.480
However, you know, I like to keep it a bit more in line and finding the balance is kind

30:04.480 --> 30:08.920
of hard, but sometimes you do have to let loose and be a little bit silly sometimes.

30:08.920 --> 30:12.680
You know, everybody needs a change, a little break.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.400
Change is good for you.

30:14.400 --> 30:19.200
Maybe you know, maybe you need to be silly more often.

30:19.200 --> 30:23.800
You're one of those people who seems to me that your energy is rooted in your root chakra,

30:23.800 --> 30:24.800
which is the first one.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.800
Oh, Jesus Christ.

30:25.800 --> 30:26.800
All right.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.800
Look, look.

30:27.800 --> 30:28.800
I want to say my piece.

30:28.800 --> 30:29.800
You know, I agree with what you're saying.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.240
It's about balance and the trick is that we have to find the right balance on this program

30:33.240 --> 30:38.480
between, you know, too crazy and too, you know, too much hardcore games because honestly,

30:38.480 --> 30:41.140
you know, there's like 300 video game podcasts out there.

30:41.140 --> 30:45.120
You know, granted, just because we were one of the first ones out there doesn't mean that,

30:45.120 --> 30:48.840
you know, people will automatically, you know, tune into us because we were one of the first.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.920
We have to compete with, you know, 300 podcasts, everything from other independent podcasts

30:52.920 --> 30:57.280
to corporate podcasts, although I don't see the other independent podcasts really as competition.

30:57.280 --> 31:01.280
So I actually want to say thank you to the emailer in a strange way because the other

31:01.280 --> 31:04.960
podcast he says he's going to go listen to instead are at least both independent podcasts

31:04.960 --> 31:06.840
that are, you know, just fine shows.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.520
There wasn't an instead there.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.880
Well, whatever.

31:09.880 --> 31:15.280
Anyway, so regardless, you know, but it's interesting because for me, I know I've listened

31:15.280 --> 31:18.440
to one of those shows before and they kind of have an off-topicness of their own.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.440
That's not a bad thing.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.820
I think you have to have a personal touch.

31:21.820 --> 31:23.800
That's what makes all these shows unique.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.720
So you know, we're still trying to find the balance in a way.

31:25.720 --> 31:28.200
Yeah, I was a little crazy the past couple of weeks, but you know, it was fun.

31:28.200 --> 31:32.800
I think what makes me happy about this one though is that he cared enough to tell us.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.800
That's true.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.680
And I mean, that to me just seems like is, you know, hey, I want you guys to do better,

31:37.680 --> 31:38.680
you know.

31:38.680 --> 31:41.640
So I mean, if that's the case, that's sort of the vibe I was getting.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.160
So I hope that's the case.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.160
Dude, I hope you're still listening.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.680
I'm sorry for picking on you.

31:45.680 --> 31:52.480
I pick on everybody out of love, but you know, honestly, that helps us do better.

31:52.480 --> 32:00.880
So if you give us, if you stick with us, keep giving us that chance, you know, we'll cry.

32:00.880 --> 32:07.320
I think you'll find again, the goal of the show is to be like friends sitting around

32:07.320 --> 32:11.560
the dinner table talking smack about games and sometimes it's going to be on topic and

32:11.560 --> 32:15.000
sometimes it's going to get a little crazy, but you know, keep in mind we do it for free.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.840
Sometimes the craziness is what keeps us going.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.240
I know I had a lot of fun the past two shows, so we'll see what happens.

32:20.240 --> 32:24.880
I hear now I realize this portion is pre-taped, but I hear Rice Princess is going to be back

32:24.880 --> 32:25.880
tonight.

32:25.880 --> 32:26.880
So we're going to have to really rein her in.

32:26.880 --> 32:27.880
Stay somewhat on topic.

32:27.880 --> 32:28.880
Yeah, I'm not going to be here.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.880
I'll be eating cake.

32:29.880 --> 32:30.880
Well, have fun.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.480
Bring me back some cake.

32:33.480 --> 32:34.480
Is it ice cream cake?

32:34.480 --> 32:35.480
I don't know.

32:35.480 --> 32:36.480
It's for grandpa.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.960
Cake the video game?

32:37.960 --> 32:38.960
Cake the band?

32:38.960 --> 32:39.960
So next email.

32:39.960 --> 32:40.960
Yes.

32:40.960 --> 32:41.960
Next email.

32:41.960 --> 32:42.960
From AZHP.

32:42.960 --> 32:43.960
Hey guys.

32:43.960 --> 32:44.960
Hey.

32:44.960 --> 32:49.320
I just wanted to comment on your story last week about PS3's price drop.

32:49.320 --> 32:53.380
David Cracker actually came out and said that the Japanese financial division was talking

32:53.380 --> 32:55.720
about price reduction, not price cut.

32:55.720 --> 32:56.720
Okay.

32:56.720 --> 33:01.900
He claimed in an interview with IGN or OneUp or someone that they were looking at ways

33:01.900 --> 33:07.680
to make the PS3 cheaper to produce, but would not pass the savings on to the consumers.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.060
Now do you guys think this is a wise decision?

33:10.060 --> 33:14.040
Would they make more money by keeping the same price, but having a cheaper cost of production?

33:14.040 --> 33:17.840
Would they benefit from having a larger install base with a price cut to get more software

33:17.840 --> 33:18.840
sales?

33:18.840 --> 33:23.880
It just feels like Sony of America doesn't even know what Sony Japan is doing or thinking.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.240
They're all just winging it.

33:25.240 --> 33:29.560
I love the PS2 even though I'm on my third one because they keep breaking, but they just

33:29.560 --> 33:33.320
keep doing the wrong thing at the wrong time with the PS3 and PSP.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.120
What's going on?

33:35.120 --> 33:41.180
Oh, you know, I would rather pay more for a quality product.

33:41.180 --> 33:42.360
That's my thought.

33:42.360 --> 33:47.000
That's actually sort of why I like my first generation Japanese PS2 because even though

33:47.000 --> 33:51.920
they had parts that were a little bit faster, they were a little bit better made in terms

33:51.920 --> 33:58.560
of their sturdiness, so it's business.

33:58.560 --> 34:02.400
They're always wanting to make things cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and not change the

34:02.400 --> 34:03.400
price.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.240
They want to make it transparent to the buyer.

34:05.240 --> 34:10.080
You're not going to know the difference unless you take it apart and look at what they did

34:10.080 --> 34:11.640
and compare it side by side.

34:11.640 --> 34:15.240
Well, it's funny we talk about balance because I think that's what Sony is having to find

34:15.240 --> 34:19.440
is a balance here between their cost and the cost to produce the system and how much they're

34:19.440 --> 34:20.440
going to charge people.

34:20.440 --> 34:24.040
That's a very fine line and obviously they took a big gamble when they charged a lot

34:24.040 --> 34:27.800
for their system and some say that gamble may not be paying off.

34:27.800 --> 34:31.520
Is it in their best interest to pass along this savings cost to the consumer?

34:31.520 --> 34:32.520
I think so.

34:32.520 --> 34:36.200
I think that if they are going to save money on the systems, they need to pass along that

34:36.200 --> 34:41.200
savings to the consumer in some way, but in the end, keep in mind Sony is losing a lot

34:41.200 --> 34:43.000
of money on the consoles still.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.360
The average Blu-ray player is still $1,000 standalone, not in PS3.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.920
You know they're taking a pretty big hit on these systems.

34:50.920 --> 34:55.400
Granted, Sony doesn't want to keep taking such a big hit so they do want to cut corners,

34:55.400 --> 34:56.400
but again, it's about a balance.

34:56.400 --> 35:01.680
If they can maybe save $100 on a system, pass along $50 of that savings to me, at least

35:01.680 --> 35:05.280
it will be the illusion of, hey, the price is falling even though they're going to actually

35:05.280 --> 35:08.680
gain a little more money if that makes sense.

35:08.680 --> 35:16.240
I hate to keep comparing things to my massage therapy, but actually a lot of what they talk

35:16.240 --> 35:20.080
about in the business aspect of that is that when you're trying to get clients in, in this

35:20.080 --> 35:24.000
case comparing it with new buyers, you make an introductory price.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.760
You make a special, you know, get your PS3 at the sale date, maybe like a corporate sponsored

35:30.760 --> 35:35.180
sale, they get a bajillion buyers, you know what I mean, they get more people purchasing

35:35.180 --> 35:39.240
it and then have it be at the regular price, they can say, oh, well, this is a good product,

35:39.240 --> 35:42.600
it's really worthwhile for you to buy it, and then other people will come back, and

35:42.600 --> 35:44.480
that's, you know, I think how you do it.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.480
All right.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.480
I hope you're listening, Sony.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.680
Sony never listens to us.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.980
Kasarai just needs a massage.

35:51.980 --> 35:54.120
He needs Jamie to touch his chakra.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.120
Not by me.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.880
I'm sorry, there's people I...

35:56.880 --> 35:58.880
Give him a happy ending.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.080
Rob Hart.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.840
Okay, this one comes from Twist.

36:04.840 --> 36:07.040
I think Twist is a new writer, too.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.040
Hi, Twist.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.040
Hi, Twist.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.040
I think that you're awesome.

36:10.040 --> 36:11.040
Anyway, hey, OLR.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.840
A few things I want to write about today.

36:12.840 --> 36:17.640
First off, I was at GameStop today, I'm so sorry, and there were two Sony men there.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.600
Sony, big capital letters.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.520
I guess they were just checking on their PS3 demo setup or something.

36:22.520 --> 36:26.760
The assistant manager there, a friend of mine, was talking to one of them and asked when

36:26.760 --> 36:28.840
the U.S. will see any white PSPs.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.020
The man explained it probably wouldn't happen.

36:31.020 --> 36:35.160
They watched Nintendo sell their multicolored systems and learned a little from it.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.440
Owning every colored system seems to be a trend in Japan and not America.

36:38.440 --> 36:43.180
Also, if a white PSP were to be released and someone who wanted a white PSP went to a store

36:43.180 --> 36:46.720
to buy one and they only had black ones available, they would leave the store and not buy any

36:46.720 --> 36:47.720
PSP.

36:47.720 --> 36:50.840
They would therefore be losing out on a PSP sale.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.760
Those were the excuses he gave.

36:53.760 --> 36:58.080
Second thing I saw interesting was the sudden interest my girlfriend has in video games.

36:58.080 --> 37:02.120
A few of my friends and I went to a local Super Smash Bros. tournament and my girlfriend

37:02.120 --> 37:03.120
tagged along.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.680
Afterwards, my friend apologized for exposing her to the nerds and the boringness and said

37:06.680 --> 37:10.000
she had a blast just watching and couldn't wait to go to the next tourney.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.240
She then grew a sudden interest in Smash Bros. and other fighting games I play.

37:14.240 --> 37:18.160
We've been dating for only two months so I didn't think she liked video games much.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.680
And instantly the sex stopped.

37:20.680 --> 37:24.680
She later explained she used to hate video games.

37:24.680 --> 37:30.380
She would get mad at her little brother all the time when they were younger and her father

37:30.380 --> 37:33.260
would chase him off the TV when he would be playing.

37:33.260 --> 37:34.440
So why the sudden interest I asked?

37:34.440 --> 37:39.120
She figured out that she hated them maybe because her brother never let her play and

37:39.120 --> 37:40.120
no one ever taught her.

37:40.120 --> 37:46.720
So I thought maybe every girl is a potential gamer but can't express it because of game-hogging

37:46.720 --> 37:47.720
brothers.

37:47.720 --> 37:50.960
I don't know, I used to just kick my brothers off and play myself.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.860
Last thing, Evolution Fighting Game Tournament, evo2k.com.

37:53.860 --> 37:54.860
You guys should check it out.

37:54.860 --> 37:56.180
It's a great experience.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.960
People here take fighting games to a whole other level.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.680
You guys have the Bimani community.

38:00.680 --> 38:03.720
I have the fighting game community, lol.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.720
That's all.

38:04.720 --> 38:05.720
Love the show.

38:05.720 --> 38:06.720
Keep it up.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.420
No matter how off topic the show goes, it's always great.

38:08.420 --> 38:12.560
You know, the fighting game community, they're some pretty hardcore people.

38:12.560 --> 38:17.480
You know, I don't follow that scene a whole lot because I suck at fighting games but yeah,

38:17.480 --> 38:18.480
it's pretty hardcore there.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.500
I like Smash Bros. though but I suck at it.

38:20.500 --> 38:23.800
There's just a funny story.

38:23.800 --> 38:29.880
There's a guy who's well known in the cosplay community now named Chris, Chris Tang.

38:29.880 --> 38:34.440
A long time ago when we first met him, he worked for Capcom and brought his own joystick

38:34.440 --> 38:40.000
over to our house and proceeded to be on like a level 5 difficulty while Dan was at like

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
a 1 difficulty and Dan actually beat him around and he said that that was the most fun he's

38:45.000 --> 38:48.900
ever had playing because someone actually managed to beat him.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.800
So losing once in a while isn't so bad?

38:51.800 --> 38:55.520
If you beat everybody that's around you, then...

38:55.520 --> 38:59.360
That's why I kind of, you know, I love fighting games but there are people who get way too

38:59.360 --> 39:03.080
into it who get too good for the game to be enjoyable I think.

39:03.080 --> 39:06.600
Have I told my Street Fighter 2 chick story on this air once?

39:06.600 --> 39:10.520
One time I was in L.A. and I was on like a trip and it was when I was younger, probably

39:10.520 --> 39:13.640
about 17 and we were at a comic book shop late one night.

39:13.640 --> 39:16.340
It was like after closing but for some reason a bunch of people were still there.

39:16.340 --> 39:20.040
There are all these hardcore Street Fighter 2 people playing and I walked in, I didn't

39:20.040 --> 39:23.360
know much about the game and I was playing Chun-Li and I kicked all their asses.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.400
I did.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.740
But the thing is that I probably beat like 8 of them in a row and they were getting pissed

39:27.740 --> 39:28.740
like who is this guy?

39:28.740 --> 39:29.740
What the hell is he doing?

39:29.740 --> 39:33.840
You know it's probably because I was doing some new, I was some new blood and they all

39:33.840 --> 39:36.800
knew each other's techniques probably so they kicked my ass.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.900
Well finally, you know when I went down?

39:38.900 --> 39:43.760
When some girl walked in and she also picked Chun-Li, she schooled me.

39:43.760 --> 39:48.640
So if you ever have some chick that's trying to play that innocent thing like, oh what's

39:48.640 --> 39:50.120
that controller?

39:50.120 --> 39:51.120
Let me try.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.360
I want to play this game.

39:52.360 --> 39:55.240
You're in for an ass kicking because she's probably just doing that.

39:55.240 --> 39:57.000
I loved doing that when I lived in Alabama.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Did I ever tell you the Tekken story?

39:59.000 --> 40:01.240
I'm sure you have but if you want to say it again real quick.

40:01.240 --> 40:05.280
Well there were these guys who had been in there all morning playing with King, nobody

40:05.280 --> 40:08.640
but King, learning all the throws and everything, playing each other.

40:08.640 --> 40:15.240
So I went in there and picked Julia who on Tekken, Julia and Jin both have moves that

40:15.240 --> 40:21.300
block throws and so I was just using them over and over again and managed to piss them

40:21.300 --> 40:28.880
off so badly that they left all of their credits in the machine and left and I of course took

40:28.880 --> 40:29.880
advantage of it.

40:29.880 --> 40:33.000
I'm not going to let any credits go to waste.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Very nice.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
I love being a girl gamer.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.200
I think we completely got off topic of that email but oh well.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.000
That's what happens when you email us.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.640
This one comes from Radink.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.640
I guess it's also pronounced.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.640
Hey, OLR.

40:43.640 --> 40:44.640
Love the show.

40:44.640 --> 40:48.000
I'm curious as to what the closing song of the show was.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.880
Is I, Future List by Kiryamoka, fame producer of the Silent Hill series.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.160
Uber email.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.720
Okay, this is from McFloyd.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.720
This is a great email.

40:59.720 --> 41:05.720
Dear OLR crew, I haven't emailed in a while so I thought it was about time I did speaking

41:05.720 --> 41:08.080
of emailing whatever happened to the letter of the week.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.000
Did it just phase out because I haven't heard one being announced for a while?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.880
The only reason I think about it is because my first email was the letter of the week

41:13.880 --> 41:17.160
and I was ecstatic about it and I haven't heard much since then.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.160
You know what?

41:18.160 --> 41:23.160
It's been, okay, I know this is hardly an excuse but I have been horrendously busy.

41:23.160 --> 41:26.320
Well, also just we haven't gotten a lot of Uber emails lately.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.320
Yours is it.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.320
Congratulations.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.320
You're a second time winner.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.240
Well, we don't get a lot of Uber emails.

41:31.240 --> 41:34.280
I think the idea behind the letter of the week was for the Uber emails that were just

41:34.280 --> 41:38.160
like too long to read on air, we would have them just be the letter of the week and everybody

41:38.160 --> 41:43.160
could go read them on their own time but we haven't gotten a lot of those lately.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.160
You know what?

41:44.160 --> 41:45.160
This one's it.

41:45.160 --> 41:48.920
It's the longest email we've received by default you in.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.480
No, but actually it's a really good email.

41:50.480 --> 41:51.640
I'm going to finish reading it.

41:51.640 --> 41:52.640
Okay.

41:52.640 --> 41:55.760
I'm finding more and more that graphics really do affect what I think of a system.

41:55.760 --> 41:59.360
I love my Xbox 360 because it has games like Gears of War and I'm very excited about the

41:59.360 --> 42:02.800
effects in Halo 3 from what I've been reading on the Bungie website.

42:02.800 --> 42:07.320
Although I don't know if I'll be buying a PS3, it still really impresses me as everything

42:07.320 --> 42:08.960
looks so realistic.

42:08.960 --> 42:12.600
If Sony made some better decisions and the price went down a bit, I might even consider

42:12.600 --> 42:16.520
getting the PS3 mainly because it has the processing power to make major games perform

42:16.520 --> 42:21.240
well and possibly to make the dashboard or whatever it's called on the PS3 very sleek,

42:21.240 --> 42:27.800
easy to navigate, and a simple place to put music, pictures, movies, et cetera.

42:27.800 --> 42:32.760
In a few years, I would see the PS3 and Xbox 360 as good game consoles but I'm worried

42:32.760 --> 42:34.080
about the Wii.

42:34.080 --> 42:38.480
It doesn't have the power to play games that will make people gasp in admiration or the

42:38.480 --> 42:41.240
space right off the bat to store large amounts of information.

42:41.240 --> 42:46.080
It has the graphics of the game generation that was supposed to last five years and it's

42:46.080 --> 42:49.120
supposed to last for a generation that could be even longer.

42:49.120 --> 42:53.160
The controller is innovative, there's no doubt, but games like Katamari Damacy pulled

42:53.160 --> 42:58.120
off innovation with regular PS2 controller and peripherals can always be made.

42:58.120 --> 43:03.320
Software like the Wii channels could very easily be copied by Sony or Microsoft and

43:03.320 --> 43:04.320
maybe even improved.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.640
So why haven't they done it?

43:05.640 --> 43:06.800
What are your opinions?

43:06.800 --> 43:10.440
How do you think the Wii will last this generation?

43:10.440 --> 43:14.240
I think, again, it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.

43:14.240 --> 43:19.240
A system is only as good as the games that are on it and on the Wii, you have Wii Sports,

43:19.240 --> 43:24.680
Zelda Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, and on the PlayStation 3, you have Mobile Suit

43:24.680 --> 43:27.120
Gundam, Sonic the Hedgehog.

43:27.120 --> 43:34.680
Granted, you have Resistance but Resistance is Resistance $600 plus $60.

43:34.680 --> 43:40.720
Let me give the PS3 benefit of the doubt, $500 plus $60 plus whatever the component

43:40.720 --> 43:42.200
cable costs to make the game look good.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.200
Is it worth that?

43:43.200 --> 43:44.520
Is it that good?

43:44.520 --> 43:46.060
I say no.

43:46.060 --> 43:48.320
For the average gamer, no.

43:48.320 --> 43:54.720
Whereas the Wii, again, the Wii is going towards a different audience than you, the hardcore

43:54.720 --> 43:55.720
gamer.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.080
They're accomplishing their goal very beautifully, I think.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.360
Honestly, I know a lot of people.

44:00.360 --> 44:02.880
We had Marissa in here last week.

44:02.880 --> 44:06.760
I've had other people I know that don't really play a lot of games or haven't played a lot

44:06.760 --> 44:07.760
since Cape It Nintendo.

44:07.760 --> 44:10.240
Grandparents are playing the Wii.

44:10.240 --> 44:15.320
Even outside the grandparents, because I think a lot of the anti-Nintendo crowd says, oh,

44:15.320 --> 44:20.080
well, a grandma may play Wii bowling, but does that mean she goes out and buys a Wii?

44:20.080 --> 44:23.640
I don't know, but that means that grandma's going to think about that for her kids.

44:23.640 --> 44:31.560
Actually, I was at Target a couple of days ago and saw this lady, probably in her early

44:31.560 --> 44:34.720
60s, buying a Wii.

44:34.720 --> 44:35.720
We were in line together.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.560
I asked her, I was like, so this is for your grandkids?

44:38.560 --> 44:40.800
She's like, no, it's for me.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.280
You know, I don't want to come off sounding like a Nintendo fanboy.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.400
To be fair, Sony has the potential.

44:46.400 --> 44:47.400
You're right.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.400
This guy's right.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.820
The system's got a lot of processing power.

44:49.820 --> 44:53.820
It's got a lot of potential, but at the same time, so does the Wii.

44:53.820 --> 44:56.240
We know Nintendo always keeps secrets about systems.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.960
They don't show off until later.

44:57.960 --> 45:01.000
The Wii really, truly has not gone online yet.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.440
I think they will, despite the whole friend code thing.

45:03.440 --> 45:07.260
I just have this feeling that once you really sit down and play Animal Crossing with Wii

45:07.260 --> 45:11.800
Connect 24, it's going to be a different type of experience all its own.

45:11.800 --> 45:16.000
In the meantime, I still think Microsoft will always be the king of gaming, online gaming

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
in this case.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
I don't know.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
We'll see.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
We'll see.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
It's just too early.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.900
I mean, wake me up when Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy 13 are out.

45:22.900 --> 45:28.480
Then I can really assess the PlayStation 3, but right now, it's a pretty box with nothing

45:28.480 --> 45:31.120
inside it.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.120
That's how I feel.

45:32.120 --> 45:35.480
Actually, mine's dusty now.

45:35.480 --> 45:36.480
If I were to show-

45:36.480 --> 45:38.240
It's a shiny, dusty collector.

45:38.240 --> 45:45.160
If I were to show my mom resistance, she might go, well, it's nice looking, but if I were

45:45.160 --> 45:50.080
to show my mom Wii Sports, she'd go, whoa, you're like up and you're moving.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.120
It's just that you just swing it.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.240
You don't have to hit a button.

45:53.240 --> 45:56.040
That's all you do?

45:56.040 --> 45:59.360
That's the difference between Nintendo and this generation and everything, despite what's

45:59.360 --> 46:00.360
in the box.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.740
Anyway, that's my ramblin' thought.

46:02.740 --> 46:04.400
There's one other issue that's been bothering me.

46:04.400 --> 46:08.960
The way people rate games, I find it disturbing, and this doesn't just relate to video games,

46:08.960 --> 46:15.160
that sex is as much a bigger deal than violence for the ratings as it's a much worse thing.

46:15.160 --> 46:18.740
For those who really understand what violence does, I suppose it's okay that violence is

46:18.740 --> 46:22.420
so prominent in video games, but when little kids grow up seeing in movies and games that

46:22.420 --> 46:26.640
violence is not such a big deal and sex is awkward or wrong, or when people do it they're

46:26.640 --> 46:30.480
somehow breaking the rules, it definitely sets them on the wrong path for looking at

46:30.480 --> 46:31.480
life.

46:31.480 --> 46:36.140
I think that as long as games and shows are separated from reality, it's okay, but when

46:36.140 --> 46:39.200
kids are becoming saturated with these ideas coming from them from all directions, it's

46:39.200 --> 46:43.800
hard for parents to give them the right information when the media controls their kids' minds.

46:43.800 --> 46:47.840
My point with all this is that you have to give the parents a break because entertainment,

46:47.840 --> 46:52.160
video games included, is affecting children, and there will always be friends with systems

46:52.160 --> 46:55.520
to play your TVs to watch, even parents try their hardest to stop it.

46:55.520 --> 46:58.980
That would require an impossible amount of patience and strength to first extract what

46:58.980 --> 47:02.920
a child has seen on TV and then put everything in context for them.

47:02.920 --> 47:06.400
Parents don't often have the courage to teach children so much about life early on, so I

47:06.400 --> 47:10.780
don't believe it's necessarily their fault if kids grow up desensitized and messed up.

47:10.780 --> 47:13.040
The media has become crueler and more vicious.

47:13.040 --> 47:18.360
Yeah, I can see it from that angle, I do understand that, but I think that it's just a matter

47:18.360 --> 47:25.600
of actually, you know, you phrased it beautifully, parents don't often have the courage to teach

47:25.600 --> 47:28.080
their children about life early on.

47:28.080 --> 47:35.280
You know, I think that if they started off educating their children, you know, that would

47:35.280 --> 47:39.720
avoid a lot of the problems, say, you know, make sure that if their child's going to see

47:39.720 --> 47:46.160
something that they understand, and actually I have a very good relation to this, I was

47:46.160 --> 47:50.640
actually just watching the second, an evening with Kevin Smith last night, he was talking

47:50.640 --> 47:51.640
about his daughter.

47:51.640 --> 47:57.360
He says he doesn't, they don't hide language around around their daughter, that they curse

47:57.360 --> 48:03.720
all they want to, and, you know, and she basically has gotten to where she doesn't want to do

48:03.720 --> 48:07.720
it just because she hears it, you know, it's not a big deal to her.

48:07.720 --> 48:11.980
You know, it's just like, well, you know, when you're dieting, if you can have all the

48:11.980 --> 48:15.360
chocolate cake you want, chocolate cake doesn't become special anymore, you won't want it

48:15.360 --> 48:16.580
as much.

48:16.580 --> 48:24.000
You know, I think that if you, not necessarily a blatant exposure of a violent element to

48:24.000 --> 48:28.920
a child, but if you explain it how it is and say, you know, this is what goes on, this

48:28.920 --> 48:34.720
is, you know, why people do this, this is what happens, if a child doesn't have to figure

48:34.720 --> 48:39.600
it out for themselves, because their logic, they're not fully developed, their logic is

48:39.600 --> 48:40.840
not all there.

48:40.840 --> 48:45.680
If you say, hey, you know, this happens, this is what goes on, they're going to be in a

48:45.680 --> 48:49.120
better position to assimilate what they're seeing.

48:49.120 --> 48:52.000
It's very interesting you bring up that point, because I kind of, one other little thing,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.720
I don't know if I was maybe mishearing or misreading into this letter, but I'm also

48:54.720 --> 49:01.320
hearing that, you know, the society and the parents have a way bigger problem with sex

49:01.320 --> 49:05.560
and games than they do with violence and games, and that's just American culture in general.

49:05.560 --> 49:10.660
I mean, you're not just talking about video games there, it is movies, it is TV, sex is

49:10.660 --> 49:13.880
always looked at way harsher than violence.

49:13.880 --> 49:18.640
I mean, seriously, a movie says the F word twice and it gets rated R, but, you know,

49:18.640 --> 49:23.720
you can blow up limbs and heads and, you know, sometimes you can still get away with a PG-13,

49:23.720 --> 49:27.480
yet we have this real problem with underage sex in this country.

49:27.480 --> 49:28.480
Interesting, hmm?

49:28.480 --> 49:33.060
I don't know, you kind of apply what you're saying there and when it's taboo, people want

49:33.060 --> 49:34.060
to do it.

49:34.060 --> 49:38.680
I bet if mom and dad talked more about them having sex in front of the kids, the kids

49:38.680 --> 49:40.760
would never want to have sex ever.

49:40.760 --> 49:41.760
I'm joking.

49:41.760 --> 49:44.280
I'm not a parent, I don't know.

49:44.280 --> 49:48.680
Just something that I have more information that I've taken from my classes.

49:48.680 --> 49:56.020
One of my teachers said that the reason why there's also a lot of unhealthiness in people

49:56.020 --> 50:00.600
is because they have an unhealthy attitude toward their bodies.

50:00.600 --> 50:06.860
You know, with us having this, you know, anorexic, waif-looking image on TV when all it is is

50:06.860 --> 50:12.580
freakin' photoshopping and unhealthiness, when you're driven to be productive, when

50:12.580 --> 50:17.920
all that's doing is raising your adrenaline, making your liver, you're dumping adrenaline

50:17.920 --> 50:20.520
into your liver, which is shortening your lifespan in general.

50:20.520 --> 50:24.820
You're not breathing properly, but also, you know, there's this whole attitude that sex

50:24.820 --> 50:27.480
is something that you don't discuss.

50:27.480 --> 50:30.880
It's something that you keep hidden, where it's offended.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.560
I'm willing to discuss sex on this program any time.

50:33.560 --> 50:40.680
Well, and you know, there's some people who don't need it so much.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.920
You know, I'm not going to...

50:42.920 --> 50:46.680
There's some people I know that do need it, because, you know, oh boy.

50:46.680 --> 50:53.160
It really, but it is, I think, you know, it is, I think, an important part of your overall

50:53.160 --> 50:54.160
well-being.

50:54.160 --> 50:58.020
It's a balance that it creates, and when we treat it like it's a disease, when we treat

50:58.020 --> 51:05.000
it like it's something that's disgusting, that's foul and immoral, you really take something

51:05.000 --> 51:09.160
that's very healthy for you and treat it.

51:09.160 --> 51:17.400
It's like having the cure for cancer and thinking that it's, and treating it illegal.

51:17.400 --> 51:19.920
All the emails have this balance theme going on tonight.

51:19.920 --> 51:21.000
I fully believe in balance.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.960
I think it's a good thing, but you know, it's just that whole, that's, you know, I hate

51:24.960 --> 51:29.800
to go off on the tangent like that, but that's my view toward how America views sex, because

51:29.800 --> 51:33.820
if you go to a lot of other countries where people just can you go around topless or,

51:33.820 --> 51:39.340
you know, where nudity is on TV and no one treats it like a big deal, look at their rate

51:39.340 --> 51:40.760
of sex crimes, you know.

51:40.760 --> 51:42.560
I'm going to start a trend right here.

51:42.560 --> 51:44.520
I'm going to go around topless in studio right now.

51:44.520 --> 51:46.520
You know what, Rob?

51:46.520 --> 51:53.520
I can't, but it's, you know, if you take a look at it, we have such a high rate of sex

51:53.520 --> 52:01.160
crime because I think it's because we do treat it like it's, like it's a disease.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.720
Your thoughts are always welcomed out there.

52:02.720 --> 52:03.720
Mail back to orangeslauncheted.com.

52:03.720 --> 52:08.440
I'm sorry for going off on it, but you know, it's, it's, it's actually something that's

52:08.440 --> 52:12.200
been sort of sitting on my head for a while because I really noticed it, you know, and

52:12.200 --> 52:13.840
the video can be another symptom of it.

52:13.840 --> 52:17.020
You know, the whole hot coffee thing is like, dude, why?

52:17.020 --> 52:20.040
It's got an M rating anyway, didn't it?

52:20.040 --> 52:21.040
I believe so.

52:21.040 --> 52:22.040
Yeah.

52:22.040 --> 52:25.440
I should have said it should have been AO, but that's R versus NC 17, but anyway, whatever.

52:25.440 --> 52:28.280
So the last, the last phrase here, and by the way, Loki got pwned.

52:28.280 --> 52:32.580
He was so confident about the Halo 3 release in spring, yet on the Bungie website, a picture

52:32.580 --> 52:37.240
had the ad campaign came out and the bottom fall, 2007 was written boldly and clearly.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.240
I guess no one's perfect, but he was still wrong.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.440
Okay, that's all bye.

52:40.440 --> 52:42.520
Listen to last week, part A, I called him on it.

52:42.520 --> 52:44.620
He has, he has some good reasoning though.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.240
So listen, take a, take a listen.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.240
P.S.

52:47.240 --> 52:50.520
Since the Wii is seventh generation and the Xbox 360 is second generation for Microsoft,

52:50.520 --> 52:55.920
the term for Wii and 360 owners should actually be Wii 69.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.320
I'm not sure how that math came about, but all right.

52:58.320 --> 52:59.320
Okay.

52:59.320 --> 53:00.320
We'll take it.

53:00.320 --> 53:01.320
We have one from Lee.

53:01.320 --> 53:02.320
Hi, Lee.

53:02.320 --> 53:04.440
Who was apparently writing us from London.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.080
Well, hello.

53:06.080 --> 53:07.760
Hi, you guys.

53:07.760 --> 53:08.760
Cheerio.

53:08.760 --> 53:11.000
Would you like to sit down and have some tea and crumpets?

53:11.000 --> 53:16.640
Hey, I got an email complimenting me on the British accent, by the way, to my personal

53:16.640 --> 53:17.640
email box.

53:17.640 --> 53:18.640
Really?

53:18.640 --> 53:19.640
Yes.

53:19.640 --> 53:20.640
Have I?

53:20.640 --> 53:21.640
I don't know.

53:21.640 --> 53:22.640
Let's not.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.640
We're running long.

53:23.640 --> 53:24.640
Let's get.

53:24.640 --> 53:30.920
One thing I really like about being from Alabama, if you, if you look up, the Southern accent

53:30.920 --> 53:31.920
is actually derived.

53:31.920 --> 53:32.920
Balance, Jamie.

53:32.920 --> 53:33.920
Balance.

53:33.920 --> 53:34.920
I am going to talk about it.

53:34.920 --> 53:40.560
The Southern accent is actually derived from the West England type, you know, region of

53:40.560 --> 53:41.560
accent.

53:41.560 --> 53:42.560
Did you read that on Wikipedia?

53:42.560 --> 53:44.160
No, I didn't.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.600
I actually took a linguistics class.

53:46.600 --> 53:47.600
All right.

53:47.600 --> 53:48.600
All right.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.600
I'll talk to you though.

53:49.600 --> 53:50.600
Anyway.

53:50.600 --> 53:51.600
Back to the email.

53:51.600 --> 53:52.600
Hi, you guys.

53:52.600 --> 53:54.560
Just wanted to comment on your marketing strategy.

53:54.560 --> 53:59.160
Rob suggested at the end of your last show that all listeners go out and let one person

53:59.160 --> 54:00.160
know about OLR.

54:00.160 --> 54:04.040
I think this may be an unnecessarily slow process and hamper your efforts at world media

54:04.040 --> 54:05.040
domination.

54:05.040 --> 54:10.040
If my maths is correct, and it most likely isn't, if all your listeners were to head

54:10.040 --> 54:14.000
out and let two people know about OLR every week, and then the following week they all

54:14.000 --> 54:18.280
in turn let two more people know, in about 30 weeks the entire population of the planet

54:18.280 --> 54:20.240
would be listening to your show.

54:20.240 --> 54:24.660
In your new position as world famous personalities, you could use the power of gaming to eradicate

54:24.660 --> 54:28.400
world poverty, cure the common cold, and create a new utopian society.

54:28.400 --> 54:29.400
Dude, utopian.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.960
I love that word.

54:30.960 --> 54:32.320
Just a suggestion though.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.320
Cheers, Lee.

54:33.320 --> 54:35.720
Lee, Lee, Lee.

54:35.720 --> 54:38.560
Lee is the new marketing manager of Orange Lounge Radio.

54:38.560 --> 54:39.560
I like the way you think, Lee.

54:39.560 --> 54:40.560
Welcome aboard, Lee.

54:40.560 --> 54:41.560
Welcome aboard.

54:41.560 --> 54:44.400
Send me a plane ticket, please.

54:44.400 --> 54:46.120
I like the way this man thinks.

54:46.120 --> 54:49.920
Therefore, at the end of the show, I will from now, I will be encouraging everyone to

54:49.920 --> 54:54.280
tell two people that now they have to tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio.

54:54.280 --> 54:57.880
And you can all thank Lee for that.

54:57.880 --> 54:58.880
I like the way he thinks.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.000
That was brilliant.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Last email.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Yay.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.320
Which is going to segment, or segue I should say, into another segment.

55:07.320 --> 55:08.320
All right.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.320
Oh.

55:09.320 --> 55:10.320
Play my music, Rob.

55:10.320 --> 55:11.320
Sure thing.

55:11.320 --> 55:23.680
The website of the week, combined with this email from our friend, ApolloChon, good morning.

55:23.680 --> 55:26.880
One of my friends, another listener, linked me to this site a few days ago, and I thought

55:26.880 --> 55:27.880
it was cute.

55:27.880 --> 55:30.640
Perhaps it could be a website of the week, or something of the sort.

55:30.640 --> 55:33.080
It at least deserves an honorable mention.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.080
Objection.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.120
Which we have discussed on the site before.

55:36.120 --> 55:39.960
I have seen previous user-made objections, so this is good.

55:39.960 --> 55:42.600
It's about time we named this the site of the week.

55:42.600 --> 55:44.600
However, it's about time.

55:44.600 --> 55:56.720
So it's objection.mrdictionary.net.php, and we actually have one submitted in this email.

55:56.720 --> 55:59.160
So you actually had an objection put in the email.

55:59.160 --> 56:03.320
Yep, and it's loading the text right now.

56:03.320 --> 56:04.320
Okay.

56:04.320 --> 56:05.320
Okay.

56:05.320 --> 56:10.520
Clearly, Dark Sakura should choose objection as the website of the week.

56:10.520 --> 56:16.320
Evidence shows that it is 99% amazing.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.680
I'd like to know what type of evidence that is, but all right.

56:19.680 --> 56:20.680
We'll take it.

56:20.680 --> 56:24.080
That sounds like one of my live channel entries to you.

56:24.080 --> 56:28.080
Anyway, that'll do it for both the website of the week and for emails.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.080
Keep them coming, y'all.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.080
All right.

56:30.080 --> 56:33.460
Any closing words you want to say to the listeners at home, Dark Sakura, before we vanish you

56:33.460 --> 56:36.720
into what's current and live on the show right now?

56:36.720 --> 56:39.160
I didn't say what I was playing this week.

56:39.160 --> 56:40.160
All right.

56:40.160 --> 56:41.160
Well, quickly tell us about your gaming week.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.160
I played World of Warcraft.

56:42.160 --> 56:43.160
Yeah?

56:43.160 --> 56:46.400
Thanks to my dear best friend, Chris.

56:46.400 --> 56:47.720
I am playing again.

56:47.720 --> 56:51.760
I don't have Burning Crusade yet because, well, I have to pay $300 at the end of March

56:51.760 --> 56:56.360
and $500 to buy a massage table in April, so I'm kind of broke.

56:56.360 --> 56:59.360
However, I played my first human.

56:59.360 --> 57:02.500
I played a warlock, and I hate kobolds.

57:02.500 --> 57:04.040
What server are you on?

57:04.040 --> 57:05.040
Ravencrest.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.040
Ravencrest?

57:06.040 --> 57:07.040
Oh, the server.

57:07.040 --> 57:08.040
We all play it.

57:08.040 --> 57:09.040
Wait a minute.

57:09.040 --> 57:10.040
I was trying to say Ravenloft.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.040
Wait, Ravencrest, but you're a human.

57:11.040 --> 57:12.040
Yes.

57:12.040 --> 57:13.040
What's your character's name?

57:13.040 --> 57:14.040
I'm not telling you.

57:14.040 --> 57:15.040
Oh, you can't say it on air.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.040
Can you whisper it to me?

57:16.040 --> 57:17.040
Can you mouth it?

57:17.040 --> 57:18.040
Why?

57:18.040 --> 57:19.040
Because you're going to hunt me down.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.040
Yes, I'm a horde, so I'm going to hunt you down.

57:20.040 --> 57:22.000
I'm going to kill you for making a character on the wrong side for the Horde.

57:22.000 --> 57:28.200
I'm going to make a horde too, but my character's name is Lorcan, which if anybody ever reads

57:28.200 --> 57:35.280
Anne Rice novels before she went stupid, it was a character in one of her last books,

57:35.280 --> 57:37.060
one of her pre-stupidity books.

57:37.060 --> 57:39.880
My character's name is posted, but if you want to know it, you have to go check the

57:39.880 --> 57:40.880
forums.

57:40.880 --> 57:41.880
Orangenotrader.com.

57:41.880 --> 57:42.880
Forums.

57:42.880 --> 57:45.000
My other characters are on Suramar.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I have a night elf on Suramar.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.760
And then on Airy Peak, I have an undead.

57:50.760 --> 57:52.600
Airy Peak is so 2006.

57:52.600 --> 57:57.840
Well, my characters, I'm just glad they weren't deleted, because I didn't play for seven months.

57:57.840 --> 58:00.880
And then they're still there.

58:00.880 --> 58:12.280
And by the way, just an honorable mention, Misty has sent us 20,000 emails from her phone.

58:12.280 --> 58:14.680
You can email, like mailbag getorangenotrader on your phone?

58:14.680 --> 58:15.680
I can do that too.

58:15.680 --> 58:16.680
Interesting.

58:16.680 --> 58:17.680
But I like this one.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.480
Hey, I miss you guys a lot.

58:19.480 --> 58:22.600
I'm just going to go ahead and get a brand new computer once my tax money gets here.

58:22.600 --> 58:23.600
Misty's funny.

58:23.600 --> 58:27.440
She sends me a lot of random AOL messages too, but it's cool.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.440
They make me chuckle.

58:28.440 --> 58:30.580
Dude, it's the doctor.

58:30.580 --> 58:33.380
On that note, we better go back to the present time.

58:33.380 --> 58:37.580
So quickly, your final thought.

58:37.580 --> 58:44.200
Anybody in the Sacramento, Roseville, Citrus Heights area, in April I will be a licensed

58:44.200 --> 58:48.160
massage therapist and my rates are $75 an hour for me to come to your house and give

58:48.160 --> 58:49.820
you the best massage ever.

58:49.820 --> 58:55.040
Is this the Orange Ontario video game show or the massage show, because I'm starting

58:55.040 --> 58:56.040
to wonder.

58:56.040 --> 58:59.800
Will you massage people while they play video games, maybe?

58:59.800 --> 59:06.000
I will do a special video game massage where I play the Final Fantasy Celtic Moon soundtrack

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
while rubbing your feet.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
All right.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
We got to go back.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.640
So, Dark Sakura, have a lovely week off and take care.

59:11.640 --> 59:12.640
Okay.

59:12.640 --> 59:13.640
All right.

59:13.640 --> 59:16.840
Through the magic of the space time continuum, that was Dark Sakura.

59:16.840 --> 59:18.400
Thank you very much, Dark Sakura.

59:18.400 --> 59:20.960
We miss you here live in the studio tonight, but our aim is improving.

59:20.960 --> 59:21.960
I will have you know.

59:21.960 --> 59:22.960
So it's very nice.

59:22.960 --> 59:23.960
All right.

59:23.960 --> 59:24.960
Well, let's get back into some news.

59:24.960 --> 59:28.640
We got some news for you guys and this is kind of interesting.

59:28.640 --> 59:29.640
Did you hear about this, Eddie?

59:29.640 --> 59:30.640
I don't know.

59:30.640 --> 59:35.120
Did you see the list that GamesRadar posted of the five game characters with one foot

59:35.120 --> 59:36.120
in the closet?

59:36.120 --> 59:37.880
I did not, but I'd love to hear it.

59:37.880 --> 59:40.360
You might want to turn on that mic.

59:40.360 --> 59:41.880
I did not, but I'd love to hear it.

59:41.880 --> 59:45.220
Well, I don't know if I want to really read the whole list, but basically it was a bit

59:45.220 --> 59:46.640
of a controversial article.

59:46.640 --> 59:52.800
They said Kratos from God of War, Marcus Fenix from Gears of War, Frank West from Dead Rising

59:52.800 --> 59:55.400
and Vaan from Final Fantasy XII.

59:55.400 --> 59:56.400
That's true.

59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.980
But what's interesting is kind of the way they went about saying it is they used a lot

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:08.160
of gay stereotypes, like so and so is cross dresses, so he must be gay because he looks

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.920
like a chick, so he must be gay.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920
That's stupid.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.920
That's pretty dumb.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:16.680
And what's interesting is it caught the radar of Gay.com, which is not a gaming site.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.680
It's a gay site.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.060
It caught the radar of Gay.com's UK edition as well as another site, Pink News.

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:26.400
And they publicly yelled at these games' radar articles.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.800
Pink News said, quote, what is the point of outing characters?

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.920
Is this yet another bunch of childish straight boys laughing at gay people?

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:39.460
And the author of the Gay.com article was elaborating that the article had a very facetious

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:44.800
tone to it and basically was making jokes about the LGBT community.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.320
And I guess because they pegged Frank West as being gay because he dresses up in women's

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.080
clothes and children's clothes for a bit of carnal experimentation.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:58.760
Yeah, I mean, gamer guys are, the subculture.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.280
Not the ones that listen to this show.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.660
I mean, we're all cool, but the subculture, like in general, does seem to be kind of homophobic.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.920
That's the tone.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.820
I think anyway, I mean, like you said, like the guys that make the games with like boobs

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.440
and stuff, you know, which is like every game, you know, yeah, I can see that where they'd

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.800
be like kind of homophobic.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.560
They make hot guys too.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.080
Have you never played any of the Castlevania games, where the hell have you been?

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.520
I mean, it's like, what is that one game that came out, God Hand?

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.200
I mean, it's like, that game is like pretty ripping on gay people and like, like I haven't

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.200
seen this game.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.960
Yeah, the God Hand, it's for PS2.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.600
I mean, the game looks pretty good, but it's like, it's pretty over the top, like just

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.600
porn for like 14 year old straight guys.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.820
Like you can like spank, but only the female characters and like there's these like really

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.940
flaming like gay villains.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:49.640
The whole game is supposed to be, it's a parody on like Kung Fu games or whatever.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.680
It's, it's like a Kung Fu hustle, the game is basically what it's supposed to be.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.680
Yeah.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.400
But like in every trailer they show like the spank attack, you know, and the, but you could

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.120
only spank the female villains.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.120
Like they didn't program it.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.120
You could just spank anyone.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.080
So the, I don't know, that's pretty like one sided to me.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.080
Interesting.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.080
I don't know.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.400
I read the original list, the games radar posted, I just thought it was stupid.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.800
Like it was like, it's like when someone tells a joke and no one laughs and believe me, I

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.240
know that feeling very well here on this program.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.840
You know, that's kind of like what I felt this guy's article was, is that like, like

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.440
some genius on one of these board meetings was said, Hey, let's do an article on like

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.960
gay guys in video games.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.520
And I don't think it was meant maliciously.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.640
So I don't get my feathers ruffled about it.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.840
Like I just look at it and go, wow, that's just stupid.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.840
Yeah.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.000
I don't get offended about it.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.320
I just go, okay dude.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320
Right.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.320
Sure dude.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.320
Dude.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.320
Yeah.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.320
Sure dude.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.880
I think Gears of War is totally gay.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.880
Yeah.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.880
You got it.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.880
Yeah.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.240
Cause he, you know, thinking about his buddies too much and all that.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:55.600
And Kratos is totally gay because he doesn't like bang two chicks at the same time in two

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600
different games.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600
Uh huh.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600
Uh huh.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.600
And he doesn't wipe his ass with tree bark.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.280
I mean, where was Makoto on the list?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.720
Like that's the reason I didn't take the list.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.720
Well, I guess maybe because it was about closeted game characters, whereas Makoto in enchanted

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.280
arms was a, you know, he was a, he was a very, if I ever saw one in the cosmos.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280
Yeah.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.160
Or with his ginormous package.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.920
Or where is King, the biggest lesbian in all of video games?

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920
Oh my God.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920
She's totally a lesbian.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.920
Yeah.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.920
I'm kind of with you guys.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.920
She's like one of my favorite characters.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.920
I don't really care.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:26.920
Yeah.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.920
I don't really care.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:28.920
I mean, whoa.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.200
You know, it's like, I just, you know, I want there to be a game where you spank guys.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.360
You like, you like Sims type games where you can just do whatever you want.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.360
Yeah.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.360
Pretty much.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.360
Yeah.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.720
As long as they let me do stuff to guys in the games.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720
Only willy ones, of course.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720
Yeah.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720
Well, yeah, no.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720
Yeah.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.720
Of course.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.720
I mean, geez.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.720
Come on now.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720
Uh-huh.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720
Come on.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.720
You guys are gay.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.720
Uh, let's see.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.240
James Patrick says, uh, God ham, the main character is gay, right?

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.240
Or becomes gay.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.760
That's what the X-Play video seemed to suggest.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.760
Yeah.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.760
Of course.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760
That's a lot of things.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.280
A lot of X-Play videos suggest gay themes for games and that's, that's kind of what

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.640
this article struck me as.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.200
It was like an X-Play review.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.760
Like it's trying like way too hard to be funny, but I just don't laugh.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.040
That's what it is.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.040
Yep.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.040
All right.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040
So, that's it.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.480
I don't have my feathers ruffled over it.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.640
I just kind of go, game's radar is wearing enough egg on their face over it.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.680
I don't need to be able to sit here, oh, it's homophobic and blah, blah, blah.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.680
No, it wasn't.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.680
It was just stupid.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.680
There's a difference.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.200
There's a difference between homophobia and stupid.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.560
Nobody really cares about you guys, so.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.560
Yeah.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.440
So, every month it seems to be that there is a story out there about somebody killing

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.200
somebody and somehow they're tying it into violent video games and that was the case

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.120
also with a Milwaukee murder.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:52.680
Fifteen-year-old Nathan Moore was a murderer of Rex Bomb, an alcoholic transient, and apparently

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.400
this Nathan Moore was quoted saying it was just like a violent video game.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.640
You know, killing the guy reminded him of a violent video game.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:06.160
So, of course everyone went, ah, it's games to blame and stuff like that.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:15.440
Um, the one, the stepmom of Nathan actually was a dedicated Penny Arcade reader and she

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.560
actually wrote him a letter regarding the whole thing and it's actually quite interesting

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:25.040
because they talk about how, you know, the kid is just kind of just crazy, doesn't, you

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.800
know, getting in trouble in every which way and, you know, doesn't, she basically points

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:35.000
out it's not the game, not video games fault and it did not make him who he was.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.800
He was already fucked up to begin with, so, um, I do think it's kind of interesting though

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:45.040
at least there's someone out there that's willing to say, hey, this is not the case.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.920
Um, and I believe someone pointed out, I can't remember where it was, but they pointed out

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.160
that, you know, he may be crazy, but he's not stupid.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:59.360
He knows that he can get like some sort of like crazy, um, insanity plea with, you know,

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:03.000
saying that, oh, video games made me do it type of thing.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.880
So I think he's just trying to use that, you know, kind of to get off a little bit.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:13.680
I don't know, but get off, get off from being, you know, I love, we can always count on the

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.360
serious perspective from rice princess.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.360
Do you have any serious thoughts on this?

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.360
Yeah.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:19.360
That was it.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.360
I farted.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.360
Yeah.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:28.360
Everybody's saying goodbye to rice princess folks, she won't be back last week.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.960
Um, anybody have any comments on that?

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:35.160
I do.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:41.140
Moving right along then, you guys are assholes, um, Microsoft has been caught in a lawsuit

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:48.680
and a federal jury ordered Microsoft to pay $1.5 billion, uh, to the, uh, telecom group

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:55.240
Actel Lucent, no Alcatel, Alcatel, like Alcatel Lucent, uh, for violating two patents related

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.240
to digital music.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:00.080
Basically it all has to do with MP3 encoding and decoding, uh, and that has to do with

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.080
Windows media player.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.560
They're going, what the hell does this have to do with gaming?

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.320
Well, uh, it's because a part of this suit has to do with speech coding and video coding

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:13.600
used in the Xbox 360, which makes you go, Hmm, will future Microsoft's products be hampered

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.720
by this?

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.040
Or is this just a case of a jury wanting to get back at Microsoft because you know, they're

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.560
evil or whatever it is.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.360
I think that they're just going to pay this and unlike, you know, Sony, they're actually

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:28.480
going to, you know, pay for the rights or whatever that they may have infringed on and

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.120
just license them.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.520
I think they do that actually for the rumble technology.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:39.600
They license the rumbling patents or whatever, although some companies decide to remove them

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.180
altogether because they don't want to shell out money.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.180
But whatever.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:50.280
So, um, you know, on a completely different topic though, um, you got to love the Russians

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:55.800
and they came up with this wonder, you know, and this is like a, such a horrible stereotype,

01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:03.600
but um, they've come up with a Russian, a massively multiplayer online drinking game.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.280
Oh my God, that's awesome.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:12.720
And apparently it's, um, you would take this special shot glass that will plug into your

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.840
computer via USB.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.400
And when you logged into a special chat room, the glass keeps track of how much alcohol

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.680
you have left just to make sure that you're keeping up.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.240
Um, so that, I don't know.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.280
If I put water in it.

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.160
Well, I suppose you could.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.160
Ha!

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.160
I fooled the computer.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.800
Well, aren't you elite hacker?

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.360
I hack sword your shot glass.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.800
With water.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.200
Or can't you just like pour it out into another cup or, you know, like there's tons of different

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.200
ways you could hack into it.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.040
Or how does it all, give it all to Irene because she's poor and can't afford it.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.960
Well, could you just go on one of those adult sites and put up a picture of somebody else?

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.320
I mean, that's about the same.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.320
Or can't you just like drink at home, like with your friends and not have to do it on

01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.440
the computer with a bunch of people you don't know?

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.720
Like, that's pretty sad.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.440
This sounds to be, to be honest, this sounds like something that they would have in like

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440
Second Life.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:12.000
Uh, Cane VM says, uh, in our chat room again, chat.orangehelter.com, Cane VM says, MMO drinking?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Hell yeah.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.640
Black Boy says, that game sounds awesome.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.800
Uh, Blaze says, innocent people will die over this game.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.840
And GS68 says, you'll die of water intoxication.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.840
That's true.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840
That's Sacramento.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.640
And, uh, apparently people like to do that here.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640
Oh God.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.640
Um.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.640
What?

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.640
It's true.

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.640
Too soon.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:31.640
Too soon.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.640
Don't give me that.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640
Okay.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.640
Yeah.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.360
You know, all those people that made those comments were like under 21 and like, oh my

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360
God, he's so cool.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.360
He's drinking game.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:43.840
I don't think Black Boy, what Black Boy participates in, uh, uh, I know they call it Free Play

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.040
Friday, but I call it Drunken Orgy over at All Games on Fridays.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040
So I think he's over 21.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.040
Oh man.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.040
They have Drunken Orgies?

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.680
Uh, we got to pick up the slack here.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.680
This is Zippy Orgies.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.680
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.360
Oh, it is, it is, uh, the end of February sweeps.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.480
How are we going to top that on the All Games Network?

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.480
We need to be pulling some ice cream.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.000
We're going to murder someone live on here.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I know.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
All right.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Bye Rob.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And you wondered why Lanky Style came back.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
All right.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Lanky Style, just put this plastic bag on your head and I got a rubber band.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I'm, I can't.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Too soon.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Too soon.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I love you.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Hearts to you.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
He's really acknowledging me.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I know how we can, I know how we can pull through the sweeps.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.040
Oh man, our ratings are number one.

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:31.080
Um, so anyway, let's go back to, all right, well, no, I know exactly how we can pull through

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.080
for sweeps.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.080
Are you okay?

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080
Lanky Style?

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.080
I didn't, I didn't mean it.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.520
An apology to Lanky Style?

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.520
I think he's giving me poundy face.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.040
It's like unsubscribe, unsubscribe right there.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.040
All right.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.040
Anyway.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.040
Don't misrepresent me.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.040
What?

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.040
I said, don't misrepresent me.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.040
At least I probably got you to talk.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.040
Fuck.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040
All right.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.040
You're mean now, Rob.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.040
I know.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040
I'm, I'm a jerk.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.040
All right.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.040
Let's see.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.080
I'm looking at chat room.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.720
Black Boy says, did anyone see the photo of me teabagging stalker Oscar?

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.520
See look, we're going to lose sweeps, you guys, we're going to fucking lose.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520
Oh man.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520
Against this.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.520
Come on.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.520
Teabagging?

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.520
That's it.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.520
I got to, that's it.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.520
I'm going to have to go and teabag rice princess right now.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.520
Get the hell away from me.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.520
He's really walking towards me.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.520
Bend over.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.520
Ah.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.520
Ah.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520
No.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.520
All right.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.520
Got a face full of crotch.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520
How much do I owe you?

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.080
Well, it's a nice segment, which is a great sweeps trick.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.840
It's playing a good old fashioned game here on Orange Lounge Radio and we have a game

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.840
called Beat the Host.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:30.600
And we asked to qualify our question earlier in chat and that was which board does Pac-Man

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.840
crash on?

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.360
And we have our winner on the line.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.720
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.720
You there?

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Hey, how's it going?

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.800
Hey, who is this?

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.900
It's the Rob D. Rob D, what board does Pac-Man crash on?

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.900
256.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.900
Right.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:47.360
The 256th board is when half of it glitches, but apparently you can actually still get

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:52.720
past it but you have to you have to be super human basically a few memorizer

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.400
thing it supposedly is possible and there is a way to have the ramen get

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.560
around that make it normal I think but I know that's that's going to Wikipedia so

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.440
I don't know too much about it alright good job you and I got the answer the

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.440

I

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:26.920
I do know this one, but I forget what it is, so I'm going to pass on that.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920
All right.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.920
Fifteen.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:29.920
Master us.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:30.920
Five, no.

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:31.920
Four.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.920
Three.

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:33.920
Pass.

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:34.920
Two.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:35.920
One.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.920
Make the point.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.480
This is a tough category tonight.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.760
Our chat room is even struggling at times.

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.400
But you did get two right and that may be enough to beat Loki.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:48.320
I don't know, my classic arcade game knowledge is a little limited on that one, fortunately,

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.480
but good luck, Loki.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.480
All right.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.480
Well, here we go.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.480
We're going to bring Loki back in studio.

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.720
If Lanky style would please go grab Loki.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.720
How was Lanky style doing?

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.200
He actually got a few of them, yeah.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.800
He would have been a very formidable opponent.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.800
All right.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.200
Well, it's a good thing Rob D didn't pick him.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.200
Yeah.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.200
I'm glad he picked a total loser like Loki.

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.200
Hi, Lanky.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.200
How you doing?

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.200
Loki's wearing the wedding shirt that Jamie and I got him, the one that says Game Over.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:13.400
Yes. Alright, well I can't tell you what Rob D got just yet, but

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.600
we'll see, it's a tough category. Anyway, I need you to look that way. Alright,

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.240
and you're going to name off, because I don't want him to see what songs are on screen. So here we go.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.800
Again, just say pass. If you want to pass, you have two minutes, and your two minutes

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.800
starts right now.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:35.800
Bubble Wobble. Yes.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:44.800
Pass.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:58.800
Dig Dug. No. Mr. Do. No. Burger Time. Yes.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:03.800
Pass.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.800
Pass.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:29.800
Contra. No. Pass. Pass.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.800
Dig Dug. Yes.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.800
Pass.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.800
45 seconds.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.800
Pass.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:02.800
30 seconds. Pass. In fact, the one you passed the first time.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:11.800
1942. No. Time travel. No.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.800
19 seconds.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:28.800
8, 7, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. All done.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.800
Alright, let's add it up. Let's see how you guys did.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.800
Rob D got two right, but Loki got three right. Loki, you win.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:41.800
You know, a lot of them I recognized, and I was like, I couldn't play them.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.800
It was really hard tonight. Chadron was doing very well, though. Rob D, I'm so sorry you didn't win.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.800
That happens. Good job, Loki. Alright, better luck next time, though. You want to hear the right answers, though?

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.800
I bet you want to know them, because this is the party. Ah, yes I do. Ah, dammit.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.800
Are we allowed to guess them? Were Tempest and Bubble Wobble in there?

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.800
Ah, yes, they both were. What were you thinking, Rice Princess?

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.800
Are we allowed to guess them as you go on? Sure, why not?

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.800
Okay, so just play them. We didn't cheat, though, because the names are up on the screen.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.800
No, I can't even see from there. Okay, good. Here we go.

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.800
What do you think, Rice Princess? Well, this is Bubble Wobble. Loki guessed that one.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.800
What do you think this one is?

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.800
Robotron? No. Oh.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.800
I have no fucking clue. Tempest, that's one.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.800
Alright, somebody got this. This is for her time.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:25.800
We both got that, actually.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.800
Yeah, I've got no clue. No idea?

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:34.800
Nope. Even, I think if I let it go in here a little bit more, it'll be here.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800
Hold on.

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.800
I think it's right here. You might recognize this.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.800
You remember that? Crystal Castles! Crystal Castles.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.800
Oh, yeah. Alright, this is Frogger.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.800
And that's Frogger.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.800
This one's a real toughie. I don't know if anyone got this right.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.800
This song's so familiar.

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.800
1943. 1943. Oh, God.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:09.800
Dig Dug. This one's Dig Dug. Somebody got that one right? Dig Dug?

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.800
This is a tough one. I think somebody in the studio said it, though.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.800
This could be Zaxxon. It is a Zaxxon. Damn it!

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.800
Zaxxon. Good job. This one's one of my favorites.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.800
I'll give you a hint, because in the balls of penguins, Sega made.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.800
Push cubes around and squish little blobs.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.800
Tango! Tango!

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:46.800
Okay, this one is a killer. I don't know if anyone got this one. I wasn't watching chat.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.800
Namco made.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.800
In most of their selections of games.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.800
Knights of the Round? Nope.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.800
Sword game.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.800
Incredibly slow-moving character.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.800
The Tower of Druaga. The Tower of Druaga was the last one.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.800
I know. I'm like, what? I said it was a killer.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.800
There it was. Your ten songs. Bubble Bobble. Tempest. Burger Time. Crystal Castles. Frogger.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.800
1943. Dig Dug. Zaxxon. Pengo. Tower of Druaga.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.800
That was a killer, but Rob D., you made a good showing, and we appreciate your participation.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.800
All right. Thanks for taking my call, and thanks for letting me participate.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.800
As a consolation prize, a lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.800
All right. Sounds great.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.800
All right. Have a good one.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.800
San Francisco treat. I know. I'll see you guys later.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.800
All right. Later, buddy.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.800
Rice Princess-A-Roni.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.800
Rice Princess-A-Roni?

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.800
Yeah, sure.

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.800
All right. There you go.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.800
All right.

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.800
Dark Tetsuya said he would have gotten five, and he knew the Tower of Druaga.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.800
Looks like some folks knew Pengo. That was very good.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.800
You know, Zaxxon sounded so familiar, and then I just had to think about it for a little bit.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.800
I'm like, aw, crap.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.800
That was a tough one, because I knew...

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.800
And by the way, I pulled all those games off GameTap earlier today,

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.800
because they have a bunch of those games,

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.800
and it's really easy for me to dump when the game is on the computer, the audio.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:04.800
And when I picked Zaxxon at first, I was like, oh, it'll be easy to recognize.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.800
And like I was playing, I was like, this is really hard.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.800
Maybe I should switch it out, but no, I kept it in there.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.800
But the Tower of Druaga, man, that's killer.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.800
That was freaking killer.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.800
Really cool. You should do old PC games or something like that,

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.800
because no one would get that stuff.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.800
All right. Rob D. and Chad, he's back in Chad and yelling,

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.800
I'm pissed at myself for not knowing Tempest and Dig Dug.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.800
I purposely put in some Xbox ones there, like Frogger and Dig Dug.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.800
So there you have it.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.800
We hope you enjoy Beat the Host.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.800
How did you guys do? Would you have gotten all ten?

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.800
Would you have beat Loki? Only you know.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.800
Be honest, no cheating on your honor.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.800
All right, we've got a couple more gaming news stories for you guys,

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.800
and then we're going to get back into the phones,

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.800
take a couple more phone calls before we say good night.

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.800
And speaking of music, because we just played a game about video game music,

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.800
who doesn't love Koji Kondo, if you know who he is anyway?

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.800
He's the author.

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.800
Zelda.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.800
Yeah, he made Legend of Zelda music, Star Fox, Mario.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.800
I mean, the guy's a legend, right?

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.800
Well, he is going to be performing at Video Games Live

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.800
this year in San Francisco.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.800
That's March 9th at 8 p.m.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.800
That's the show during the Game Developers Conference,

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.800
which I may or may not be going to.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.800
I'm still trying to work out some last-minute details.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.800
I'm hoping to go to the Game Developers Conference

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.800
with the All Games crew, but we'll see.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.800
Yeah, they did something like that in Japan,

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.800
where they actually had an orchestral concert of all the Nintendo music.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.800
I guess there's words to the Epona song from Ocarina of Time

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.800
that this woman was opera singing.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.800
It was pretty crazy.

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.800
There you go.

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.800
I really want to go just to see this.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:36.800
I think it would be great.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.800
A lot of the songs they play at a Video Games Live,

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.800
I don't know if I get, but I think it would be really cool.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.800
I did not get into some of the LucasArts games like a lot of people did.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.800
I do love Loom and Monkey Island, some of that stuff,

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.800
but apparently they're going to have some LucasArts stuff,

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.800
and apparently there's going to be a Contra presentation,

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.800
which should be interesting.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.800
But when I think about Contra, I don't think about the music.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.800
Does it just mean?

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.800
I don't know.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.800
Some of the last games were pretty heavy metal,

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.800
which would be kind of cool to see for formula.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.800
Oh yeah, Kira. That would be awesome.

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800
All right.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.800
Well, I guess we've got one more story for you guys tonight,

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.800
and then we're going to open up the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.800
So the big story is Itagaki is working on something new

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.800
and something that doesn't have to do with boobies apparently.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.800
Is it Day Rape?

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.800
No, it's not Day Rape.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.800
He got it.

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:24.800
But here's the thing, though.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.800
Everyone's thinking this is going to be a big thing,

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.800
but he did everybody party or every party or whatever,

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.800
so he has done different things.

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.800
So he's working on a new project that's not going to be DOA related.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.800
He says, I'll be announcing such a game in the new future,

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.800
the title of the game aside.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.800
It's like no other type of game I've ever made.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.800
Hooray.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:53.800
So I will have news about an amazing game soon.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.800
Why?

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.800
We're back to that again.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.800
Did you see me in Almond Joy here?

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:58.800
Oh, yay.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:26:59.800
Oh, sorry.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.800
We're on the air.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.800
I love Almond Joy.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:02.800
Coconut.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:03.800
Dude, almonds.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.800
Or as my dad would say, Ammon Joy.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.800
Oh, it's shaped like an egg.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.800
I can shove it up your ass.

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.800
You'd probably like that.

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:09.800
You have some ammons?

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.800
Some ammons?

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.800
That's what my dad's going to say.

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.800
You like ammons?

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.800
Ammons are crunchy?

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:17.800
You know they have a big ammon factory in downtown Sacramento.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.800
Oh, yeah?

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.800
Diamond.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.800
Have you ever driven by it?

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:21.800
Video game.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.800
Oh, yeah.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:23.800
Oh, yeah.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.800
We're on a video game show.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.800
Well, I guess we should let some callers call in and direct the show otherwise.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.800
1877 Game OLR.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:29.800
There's always our Skype line username, OrangeLawnTradio.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:35.800
There's more information on our website, www.orangelawntradio.com, by clicking on interact with us.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800
Let's go to the phones.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnTradio.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.800
Who's this?

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.800
Raven's Dolphin.

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:40.800
Hi, Raven's Dolphin.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.800
Oh, I got time to eat my egg here.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.800
You like Almond Joys?

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.800
I love Almond Joys.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.800
I know.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.800
It's good stuff.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.800
All right.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.800
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.800
I was waiting for you to get to my call all night.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:55.800
I was so excited to tell you that I knew that you pulled it off GameTab.

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.800
Nine out of the ten games are on GameTab.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.800
Ten out of the ten games are on GameTab.

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.800
Really?

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.800
I just didn't want it to sound like, you know, I don't know, that they were like, they paid

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.800
us off to be.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.800
No, I did it from GameTab because it's easy that way, to be honest.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.800
And they do have a lot of classic games on there.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.800
I like GameTab, especially Abe Lincoln Must Die.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.800
I haven't even played that.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:17.800
What the hell is that?

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:18.800
That sounds awesome.

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:19.800
That's the new Sam and Max episode.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.800
Oh, no, I need to play the Sam and Max games.

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.800
If you played Sam and Max, you would know, does the carpet match the drapes?

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.800
I don't want to know the answer to that.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.800
I seriously need to ban myself from World of Warcraft for a week so I can play some

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.800
of these computer games I've been missing.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.800
Have you checked out Missed Online?

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:40.800
I haven't gotten missed through, but I heard it's great.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:41.800
I want to.

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.800
Are you a fan of Missed?

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:44.800
Eddie?

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.800
I'm a huge fan of Missed.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:47.800
I love Missed.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:48.800
It's awesome.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.800
And, yeah, it's cool.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.800
I'm surprised you don't know about Missed Online then.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.800
It just opened up on Valentine's Day.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:54.800
I know.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.800
Eddie has this, like, Christmas little boy face on right now.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.800
Well, yeah, because I'm like probably the only person who still likes point-and-click

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.800
games where I'm like, oh, I missed.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.800
Click games?

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.800
Point-and-click.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.800
All right.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.800
Ravenstaufen, one more question.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.800
What else are on your mind tonight?

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.800
I got a phone to pick with Loki.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.800
All right.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.800
Loki, Ravenstaufen's going to pick your bones.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:17.800
Ew.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:18.800
All right.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.800
What's on your mind?

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:23.800
Loki, you said about 15-inch television.

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:28.800
I own a 50-inch television and I'm not gay, and you said go buy a PC monitor.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:29.800
I don't have money.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:34.800
My mom said, here, have this 15-inch HDTV monitor.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.800
Wouldn't you like it for games?

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.800
And I said, yes.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.800
When in the hell did he say that 15-inch monitors made you gay?

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.800
I don't even remember saying that.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.800
I never said that.

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.800
Oh, when you were on all games on Monday, you must have said it.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.800
I don't even remember saying that.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:51.800
You know what?

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.800
Scott totally sets us up to say mean things so we get angry listeners.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:59.800
No, I think what I was saying, I think what I was saying, I can't remember.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:02.800
I swear to God, every time I've been on that program, he tries to get me to talk about

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.800
another podcast.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:08.800
Someone had a 15-inch LCD TV or whatever and they spent, I forget how much money on it,

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.800
and I said, well, you should just go buy a fucking monitor because they're a lot cheaper

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:20.800
and you can get a 19-inch or even a 21-inch or whatever and you can do HD on a PC monitor,

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.800
so just spend the money on that instead.

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.800
Yeah.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.800
All right, well, there.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.800
I never said gay, though, ever in that argument.

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.800
I said retarded but not gay.

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800
I was improv-ing.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.800
All right.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:37.800
What else?

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800
One more thing.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.800
It's always one more thing.

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:41.800
All right.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800
It's your trademark, though.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.800
You know?

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.800
Yeah.

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:45.800
You should have.

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:46.800
Do you have a Myspace Ravenstaufen?

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:47.800
Yes, I do.

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:48.800
Okay, yeah.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.800
I was going to say, you need to get one and put a little picture of yourself on there

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:54.800
with little text underneath it that says, one more thing, and you should have a little

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.800
picture of you going with the hand.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:57.800
One.

01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:58.800
Of course.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:30:59.800
All right.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:00.800
Forget it.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.800
What's your one more thing?

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.800
My headset is orange for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:05.800
Aww.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.800
I just threw up in my mouth.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:09.800
All right.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.800
Thanks, Ravenstaufen.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:11.800
You're cool.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:12.800
You too.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.800
Bye.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:14.800
All right.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.800
Take care.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:16.800
Bye.

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:17.800
Let's go to another phone call.

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:18.800
What was that?

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.800
What the hell did I do there?

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:20.800
I have no idea.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.800
I'm eagerly anticipating chicken shoot.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.800
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.800
Who's this?

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.800
Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:28.800
Hi, Paradox Vincent.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:29.800
What's on your mind?

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.800
Not much.

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.800
Not much?

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.800
Well, what the hell are you calling us for tonight?

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.800
What do you want to talk to us about?

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:54.800
I just think that on the Best Buy story, did that cover the internal, the whole scandal

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:59.800
on their big internal internet, the external internet website?

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:02.800
No, we did not cover that story.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:03.800
What the hell is this about?

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.800
So the Best Buy, their internal is the external site?

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.800
What's this about?

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:14.800
Well, basically, I've heard that they'll offer sales on their external website, which

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:21.800
you can access from their home, and they'll say, oh, well, there's a sale on this, so

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:28.800
I want to go pick it up, this camera that's been discounted down to 130.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.800
But then you go into the store and they won't let you have it.

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.800
Yeah, and then they say, oh, that sale ended at seven plus time, and you said, well, I

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:38.800
checked the website.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.800
And they say, oh, the website must have been responding slowly.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:46.800
Let's go check this one in store, and then they'll go check it and show you, see where

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.800
it ended at this date.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.800
And I just think that too.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:57.800
Well, to be fair paradox, Vincent, there's a lot of stores that do the online only deals,

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:01.800
like I've shopped at circuitcity.com, and I believe that's the site.

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:05.800
Please don't quote me on this, but I believe that's the site that won't show you what the

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:08.800
sale price is until you put it in your cart.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:12.800
And then you have Walmart and Target both sell things on their website that they don't

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.800
even sell in the store.

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:17.800
The reason why they don't show you that price on there is because sometimes they will have

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:22.800
an agreement with the publisher or whoever that they have a minimum advertised price,

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:26.800
which they cannot advertise a price lower than that, or in other words, they won't get

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.800
their co-op dollars to advertise.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.800
They get paid by these companies to advertise their products.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:35.800
I am surprised, though, that Best Buy does not do price matching, because a lot of companies

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.800
will do price matching, where if you can bring in an ad from a competitor, they'll match

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:41.800
the price.

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.800
And I would think the Best Buy ought to be able to match itself.

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.800
And a lot of times Best Buy does retarded, though, because I went in for a camera that

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:54.800
was marked down and priced a couple hundred dollars, and they said they didn't have it,

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:59.800
but they were retarded because it was actually last year's model that it was marked down.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:00.800
They had it in a shelf.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:04.800
They had to actually open up a cabinet to get this thing out.

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:07.800
So, it might be just retarded for an employee.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.800
I don't even think that they say that it's an online-only sale.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:19.800
I really don't think that it is an online-only sale, and I just think that's really too shady

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.800
for anything.

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:21.800
Is it shady?

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:22.800
Yes.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:23.800
Is it illegal?

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:24.800
No.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:28.800
So, there's really not a lot we can do about it but take our dollars elsewhere.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:35.800
Yeah, and I'm also really excited about the gold testing in Naperville, because I'm really

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:41.800
hoping that means they'll bring it out here and that the arcade in Arizona will get gold,

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.800
because it seriously needs an upgrade from that.

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:49.800
You know, again, he's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.800
If you're a new listener to Orange Lounge, you don't know the Bimani music game scene.

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:59.800
He's talking about Beatmania 2DX Gold, which is basically the 14th release for Japan, the

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.800
first one they're testing in the arcades here, although they did put the game out as Beatmania

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.800
on U.S. consoles a while ago.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:08.800
Yeah, you know, I think the machine does insanely well, which it has the potential to do.

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:12.800
I think you're going to have a lot of people driving in to play the machine from nearby

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:13.800
areas.

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.800
I think you're going to start seeing this.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.800
The only blockade is going to be the machine.

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.800
It's still going to be one of the more expensive ones to purchase, but I think you're going

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.800
to see arcades around the areas take the plunge.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:26.800
I'm sure the golf land chain, which is big on the West Coast, especially California,

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.800
Arizona, I'm sure they'll take the plunge.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.800
They usually do with Bimani games.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.800
I really wish they do.

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.800
I think that's what they might have been working on while they wanted to work on Beatmania

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.800
U.S. 2.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.800
I think they might have, maybe?

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.800
Maybe they said, what the hell are we doing two separate games for?

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:47.800
Let's just make it the same.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.800
I say, it's about time.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.800
Yeah, I do think it's about time.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.800
All right.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.800
Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for the call.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.800
Take care, buddy.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:58.800
We'll see you next time, all right?

01:35:58.800 --> 01:35:59.800
All right.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.800
Later.

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:01.800
Bye.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.800
That was the NOS Cross, so they will bring the game to you very soon.

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.800
To all of us, because I would like to play 2DX Gold.

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.800
I don't know about you.

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.800
Lankystyle, you're a big fan of Beatmania 2DX, aren't you?

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.800
I used to be.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:14.800
Did you hear about Beatmania 2DX Gold, testing over here in the U.S.?

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:15.800
Nope.

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:16.800
Oh.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:17.800
What's that?

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:18.800
The 14th version.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.800
Why did you stop playing Beatmania 2DX?

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.800
I've been doing other things.

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.800
Like, masturbating?

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:27.800
No.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.800
Okay.

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:30.800
Like, writing a book?

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.800
Yes.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.800
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:35.800
Whoa.

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.800
Hey, sorry to call in again, but I do have a couple of comments to make about games.

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.800
All right, well, Rob D., I suppose. As long as you're going to keep it on topic.

01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:46.800
But no talking about amanjoys or I'll have to hang up.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.800
I don't think you have to worry about that from me, but...

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.800
All right.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:58.800
Okay, so, I don't know. You guys were talking about the Wii earlier and how it does have problems with games coming out

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.800
and the lack of games for it, for that matter.

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.800
I don't know. I think that all three consoles have trouble with games at this point.

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.800
Actually, yeah, they do all have trouble with games in some way, shape, or form.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:10.800
The 360 has a lack of variety with its games.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.800
If you're an RPG fan, if you're a fighting game fan, if you're a platformer fan,

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:17.800
I can't imagine you're too thrilled with the 360's game lineup.

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.800
True, and you just said Rice Princess right there, right?

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.800
Oh, my God, you're my hero.

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.800
This is why you have never been a big Microsoft fan, correct?

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.800
Pretty much, yeah.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.800
Are you going to change your mind on 360 anytime soon?

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.800
No.

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:30.800
Not even Blue Dragon?

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.800
Nope.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.800
All right. Sorry, Rob, did you keep going?

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.800
And then the Wii, obviously.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:36.800
It just came out, but it does have some trouble with games right now.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:40.800
I think a lot of third-party developers are unwilling to hop on the bandwagon

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:46.800
or were unwilling to hop on the bandwagon because of the odd nature of the controller,

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:51.800
and now I think by Christmas you'll see a lot more developers willing to give it a shot.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.800
Do you think maybe it's just the time of year?

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:55.800
Because this is usually kind of a slow period for games.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.800
We don't see a lot of big games start really hitting until summer.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.800
Like come May, June, we'll start seeing more games in November.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.800
Whoa, big flood of games.

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.800
Do you think maybe that's just part of it, why we feel a little bit robbed right now?

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:08.800
No pun intended.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:13.800
Probably, but I think the E3 PowerPoint Expo in May will be very telling.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.800
The PowerPoint Expo.

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:20.800
To see what people announce and see what people have for the Wii, the PS3, and the 360.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:29.800
I'm hearing that the E3 Elitism Expo is actually supposed to be now possibly all the way to October.

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.800
Yeah, we'll see what happens with it. I honestly don't know that much about it yet.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.800
And I call it the Elitism Expo because only the most elite of the gaming media

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.800
who has their mouths firmly on the cock of the various gaming companies out there

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.800
will get an invite to this.

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.800
And why didn't I get an invite?

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.800
I actually might be going to the Elitism Expo because...

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:53.800
Oh, really? Something you need to share with us here on the program.

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:57.800
Well, because distribution is in a whole different category.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.800
Isn't it funny how no one's excited about E3 now?

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.800
Oh, fuck E3. Who gives a shit?

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.800
Well, there went our invite.

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:08.800
Well, it's no longer a rock star show like it used to be.

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:13.800
Actually, yeah, it's no longer a big show and rock star is never there anyway,

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:15.800
so we wouldn't see Grand Theft Auto.

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:19.800
Well, I meant rock stars and giant sound systems and that sort of thing.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:24.800
Look, last year when I got diverted walking around the booth because of Paris Hilton,

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:30.800
I was pissed. I was so pissed. I was like, this show just makes me mad.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.800
Although I did have a great time.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.800
I did have a great time.

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.800
I did have a great time. It was really fun to play all the new games and talk about them,

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.800
but damn, Paris Hilton. I mean, man, fuck her.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:39.800
She's everywhere.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:41.800
Anything else, Rob?

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.800
I don't know. I think this Christmas is going to be very interesting.

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.800
I think the coming years are going to be very interesting

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:49.800
because the console race is really wide open this year, well, this generation.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.800
What do you think?

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:54.800
The established leaders' problems are well documented.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:58.800
Sony's got a lot of problems because they're trying to release a system

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:04.800
that's an all-in-one media center for $600 when all they want is a game machine.

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.800
We asked a lot of people in the program what the PS3 can do to get a bigger foot in the marketplace here

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.800
and get some of their love back from all these PS2 loyalists because they'll tell you,

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.800
I love my PlayStation 2, but I'm not so hot on the PlayStation 3.

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.800
I'm going to ask you, what will Sony do, you think?

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:24.800
I think we might see a price drop by this Christmas, honestly.

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.800
I don't know how they're going to survive otherwise.

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:29.800
I really don't. $600, $500.

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:35.800
It's a lot easier to convince kids' parents or even to convince 20- to 30-year-olds

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:40.800
or teenagers with jobs to get the 360, which is going to have a price drop.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.800
You know that by this Christmas.

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:43.800
No question about that.

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:45.800
They're well overdue for one.

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.800
Or the Wii, which is $250.

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:48.800
You know what, though?

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.800
If worst comes to worst, though, you'll get your lame movie tie-in games that will sell like crazy.

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.800
Wasn't Cars the biggest selling game last year?

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:55.800
No.

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.800
Or something?

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.800
I don't know.

01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:58.800
It was some lame movie tie-in game.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:01.800
It was the highest selling game last year.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.800
There was Madden. Madden's always the big one.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:10.800
Movie tie-in stuff, I don't know.

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:15.800
Cars did okay, but it came out back in June.

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:20.800
Then the sales had already died by the time it came into Christmas.

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:23.800
Zappi says Cars was number three, Madden was number one.

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:29.800
I'm just saying, although there may not be a lot for us hardcore gamers,

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:35.800
the casual gamers and the kiddies, they do have a really big pull in this market we often neglect

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.800
when we're coming up with all these consensuses.

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:44.800
Yeah, but yeah, it is Sony, so who knows if they'll actually have that price drop.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.800
We'll see. I hope so for their sake.

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.800
Because otherwise I don't know how they're going to...

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.800
Well, actually, again, the thing is we'll see where the Japanese developers go, too.

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.800
The ones that make the platformers, the RPGs, the fighting games, because they're not too high on Microsoft.

01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:58.800
Well, at least they always have Ridge Racer.

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.800
Exactly. And the eye of judgment.

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.800
I know what they're going to do, Rob, to save themselves.

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.800
Sony's going to include a copy of Rainbow Island with the system.

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:10.800
That's a brilliant idea.

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:11.800
I know.

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:12.800
God, you should go work for Sony.

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:13.800
I shouldn't.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:15.800
All right. Thank you, Rob, for the call.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.800
All right, thanks for taking me again.

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:18.800
No problem. Have a good one.

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:19.800
I don't think you're showing anymore.

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:20.800
All right, no problem.

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:21.800
See you guys later.

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.800
Bye.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.800
We just kind of hit the answer button on whoever's on deck, but unfortunately we got to call it a night.

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:28.800
We're running kind of long.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.800
We took a bunch of calls in part A. We've had a lot of people on the show tonight.

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.800
Although we do appreciate all you guys calling in.

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:34.800
We're sorry to those digging through.

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:37.800
There were seriously like five people still hammering the line, so I'm so sorry to those of you guys.

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.800
We'll try to get you guys next week.

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:40.800
I'm sorry.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.800
Do you want to do one real quick?

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:45.800
Yeah, sure, even though you just hung up on something.

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.800
Real, real, real freaking quick.

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:48.800
Okay, 60 seconds.

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.800
Orange House Radio, who's this?

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:51.800
Legend of Zaku.

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.800
All right, Zaku, get it out.

01:42:52.800 --> 01:43:01.800
Just the fact that it's my understanding that the PS3 is just going to become that sinking ship, the Titanic.

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:02.800
Yes, it is.

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.800
As some would call it.

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.800
I'll never let go, Zaku.

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:06.800
I'll never let go.

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:07.800
Oh, please, yes.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.800
All right, this will go on.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:21.800
I'm just worried about, you know, honestly, you know, what I'm worried about right now is other games, you know, such as Crackdown, selling other things like, you know, for example, the Halo 3 Beta.

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:33.800
I mean, seeing that Crackdown is a really good game, I don't know if, you know, the Halo 3, all that hype might actually, you know, help the series in the long term.

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:41.800
Zaku, with the remaining 15 seconds, how can, I'll say, how can Sony get out of this mess minus the Final Fantasy 13?

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.800
Metal Gear Solid 4, does that depend?

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:45.800
Minus the two big ones.

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.800
Everybody knows about those.

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.800
Minus those two.

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.800
They need to get more downloadable content, more downloadable games.

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:54.800
Flow and Qbert, I think, are not cutting it right now.

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.800
So they need that and just, you know.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.800
But what about Warlock?

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:07.800
Oh, yeah, that too, but you have to also consider that it needs to compete with the likes of the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console.

01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.800
They need to get all their cards out just to be in the same footing.

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.800
You know what, they need achievement points.

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:13.800
That too.

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:16.800
All right, Zaku, got to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:17.800
All right.

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:18.800
Later, buddy.

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:19.800
All right.

01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:20.800
Bye.

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.800
That's it.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:22.800
All right.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:23.800
I just feel bad for this one.

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:25.800
Hi, who's this?

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:26.800
It's Ron Rowe.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.800
You know, I'm still pissed that I was on a call coming up from a con while I missed an awesome show last week.

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:32.800
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:33.800
30 seconds.

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.800
Quick, con review.

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:36.800
Okay.

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:37.800
Con was great.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:42.800
One of the guys in the chat, Mr. Wonderful, will be doing a complete con report for you guys in the chat by next week.

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:48.800
Also, to reiterate for Best Buy, yes, they do price next, but the trick is there's got to be a local store in the area.

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.800
How's that?

01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:50.800
That's beautiful.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:51.800
Thank you, Rama.

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:52.800
Later.

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:54.800
All our calls should be like that, seriously.

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:55.800
Wow, he's like-

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.800
Fucking in and out.

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:57.800
He knows the sound of it.

01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:58.800
I know.

01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.800
You just do that every time.

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:00.800
Like, get it out.

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:01.800
Beautiful.

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.800
Whip it out now.

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.800
30 seconds or die.

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:04.800
That'd be beautiful.

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.800
Okay.

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:06.800
All right.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.800
I don't know what just happened there.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:13.800
But I do know it's time to ask if there's any last minute stories.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.800
Loki?

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.800
Loki has his hand out for a microphone.

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:17.800
Give me-

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.800
Anyways.

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.800
Yeah, there's going to be- I have some really small stuff.

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.800
Real quick.

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.800
Jasmine Toys announced Halo themed laser tag rifles.

01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:36.800
So yeah, this Jasmine laser command line apparently is this brand that competes with the other laser tag rifles.

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:37.800
The other laser tag line out there.

01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:40.800
You know, the cheap ass ones that you buy at KV Toys and stuff.

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.800
Laser cats.

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:44.800
Speaking of which, their minds-

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.800
Now that's what- God damn it, right there.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.800
That's what the PlayStation 3 needs.

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.800
Laser cats.

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:50.800
Laser cats the game.

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:51.800
Show of hands.

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:54.800
If they put out laser cats the game on the PlayStation 3, who would buy?

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.800
All the hands in the room are up.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:57.800
My feet are up too.

01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.800
Oh my God.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.800
There it is.

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:02.800
Dude, somebody put a phone call into Sony right now.

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.800
Dude, look up Sony's number.

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:05.800
Can we call them right now?

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:07.800
No.

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:11.800
And speaking of which, we need to go play laser- or play QZR soon.

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:12.800
Alright, fine.

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:13.800
QZR trip.

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.800
Dude, laser cats the game could save the PlayStation 3.

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:17.800
Oh my God.

01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.800
I want a laser cat.

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.800
I really do.

01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.800
Nobody knows what we're talking about, do they?

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.800
Oh my God, they totally should.

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.800
Paradox bits in chat.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:27.800
Hands, feet.

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.800
SSJ 100 mat.

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:31.800
Laser cats over Thunder cats.

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.800
Act deaf says nope.

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.800
No.

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:37.800
No, they should just have a laser cat's cover for the Wiimote.

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:38.800
There you go.

01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.800
Alright, sorry to interrupt.

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:41.800
Anyway, let's make one.

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.800
What's up on eBay?

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.800
Just like cut out a stuffed animal cat.

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.800
Just like take the stuffing out of a stuffed animal cat and like slide it over the Wiimote.

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.800
No, we're going to go further.

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:55.800
We're going to get an actual cat, you know, a taxidermist to make one.

01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.800
Meow, meow, meow.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:59.800
Hey Eddie, you forgot one thing.

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:05.800
I just started using laser cats again.

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:07.800
I love laser cats.

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:08.800
Oh, God.

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.800
We should be designing games.

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:11.800
And cats.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:16.800
Let's quit the show and start orange lounge games, even though that Konami might sue us

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:17.800
over that.

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:19.800
We'll just start, you know, orange.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:20.800
Tabby cat.

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.800
Or, I don't know, we'll start, you know, peach lounge games or something.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:25.800
That's terrible.

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:26.800
How about sunrise?

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.800
Yeah, there you go, sunrise.

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:29.800
I don't know.

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:30.800
Tangerine.

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:31.800
Or Irene Mooney Me.

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:32.800
I don't know.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:33.800
All right.

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:34.800
Okay.

01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.800
Anything else, Loki?

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:37.800
That's about it.

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.800
All right.

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:41.800
We're dorks.

01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.800
Gaming nerd says a samurai laser cats.

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.800
Samurai laser cats.

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:49.800
I used to watch that cartoon.

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.800
Joshi says orange soda lounge games.

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:52.800
There you go.

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:53.800
Orange crush lounge games.

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:54.800
Oh, my God.

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:56.800
That would be another copyright infringement.

01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:57.800
I do it once.

01:47:57.800 --> 01:47:58.800
All right.

01:47:58.800 --> 01:47:59.800
Anyway.

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:00.800
I know.

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.800
Moving on, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:05.800
Rice Princess, thanks for being here and ruining the show with your dry wit.

01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.800
As always, your final thought.

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:08.800
Dry wit, what?

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.800
Well, I was thinking of this very serious, poignant matter.

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.800
It's about time.

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.800
Yeah.

01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.800
Eddie, your final thought.

01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.800
Hot tubs are cool.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:27.800
Pervert.

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:30.800
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.800
I hate people.

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.800
Loki, your final thought.

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:34.800
Oh, sorry.

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:35.800
Blue mittens.

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:38.800
Loki, your final thought.

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.800
Guess reject false icons.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:42.800
Fuck the reject false icons.

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.800
Worship those false icons like never before.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:50.800
Bow down to the golden cow.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.800
Oh, my God.

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:52.800
Don't listen to the Moses scene, yeah.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.800
I've got a golden calf, yeah.

01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:00.800
My final thought is, am in joy.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.800
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.800
Please leave us a five-star retune on iTunes.

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:07.800
Please leave us a dig.

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:08.800
What do we have to do?

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:11.800
I will send Rice Princess over there to make love to you, if that's what it takes.

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:12.800
It's getting hot.

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.800
You should declare your love for Rice Princess in a five-star iTunes review.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.800
Actually, I got a message from Speedy F40.

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.800
It says, tell Rice Princess that I still have a crush on her because she sounds like a freak.

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:25.800
Oh, that's kind of scary.

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:27.800
There's going to be a love triangle going on here.

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:28.800
Oh, my God.

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:29.800
With who?

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:30.800
All right.

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.800
With Stacia.

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.800
Do you like farting?

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:33.800
What?

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:38.800
Because you need to like that to be with Rice Princess.

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:45.800
Well, Rice Princess will choose who her heart belongs to based on who leaves the most five-star

01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:46.800
iTunes reviews.

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:47.800
There you go.

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:48.800
Who sends me golden wow?

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:49.800
No.

01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:53.800
In all seriousness, actually, remember what our new marketing director said.

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.800
Tell two people about Orange Lawns Radio.

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:56.800
That's all we ask.

01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.800
Then, if those two people tell two more people.

01:49:58.800 --> 01:49:59.800
Oh, my God.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:00.800
Are you Ron Pupil?

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:03.800
Like, if you tell someone, we'll give you a free food night.

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.800
We'll throw in a free and enjoy A.

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:08.800
That's already been eaten because we eat them.

01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:11.800
I'll autograph it and put it on eBay.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:12.800
It'll sell for millions.

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:13.800
It'll sell for nothing.

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:14.800
All right.

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.800
We really need to end the show now, so cue the outgoing music, please.

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:17.800
Cue cue.

01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.800
