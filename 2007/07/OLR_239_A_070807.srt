00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,220
Tonight, July 15th, 2007, an E3 wrap-up, Microsoft gets Disney movies, Nintendo wants you to

2
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:32,560
get fit, and Sony gives the PSP a makeover.

3
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,640
Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,680
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

5
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
lifestyle.

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
You might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,160
Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Yo.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
How you doing, Jamie?

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Uh.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Yeah.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
A little, uh.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
Conventioning to this morning.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
Ah.

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,000
We'll talk a little more about that in just a moment, but let me introduce as well, Techmaster

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Loki.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How you doing, Techmaster Loki?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm doing fine.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Swell.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Are you all conventioned out as well?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,960
Oh, that's too bad or good?

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
I don't know if that's good news.

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
I didn't really go through the convention at all.

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
All right.

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,920
We'll talk about the convention in just a little bit.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,600
We have, unfortunately, no real special guests in the studio tonight.

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,740
I mean, Xfer's over there playing WoW, but that means he's probably too busy to actually

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,400
comment on tonight's programs.

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Some other folks might come in and out, as sometimes happens around here, because we

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,520
have an open studio, and we never know who's going to show up here at Orange Lounge Radio,

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,280
but we do always have the chat room, and you never know who's going to show up in our chat

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
room.

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,200
If you head on over to orangeloungeradio.com and click on Chat, you can join us and randomly

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,140
comment on the show as it's going on.

38
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,020
We have some new folks in chat tonight.

39
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,020
We Too is in chat.

40
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,660
I don't know if I said that name wrong.

41
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,880
It says, geez, Rob sounds different from the podcast.

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
I don't know.

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,320
Well, it could be the fact that it's a different bit rate when we stream live than it is on

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
the podcast.

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,880
I think it's a little cleaner.

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,040
Our live stream actually uses MP3 Pro encoding.

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,800
Actually, the podcast, our audio archive, uses MP3 Pro as well.

48
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,200
Unfortunately, the iPods don't recognize MP3 Pro, which is how most people listen to us.

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,800
If you listen to the shows on WinApp, it actually sounds a little cleaner if you have the MP3

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Pro plug-in installed.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Just a little tip for those of you guys that listen live at home.

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Anyhow, let's start off tonight's program talking about how is your gaming week.

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,000
Unfortunately, none of us were able to go to E3 this year, so we didn't get to do that,

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,040
but we'll be talking a lot about that and giving our opinions on things as outsiders

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,560
looking in, as well as really relying on your comments as well to let us know what you thought

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,040
of this year's E3.

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,600
What kind of games did you play this week since you weren't in E3?

58
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Dark Sakura.

59
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,480
Well, I tried to play some Para Para Paradise.

60
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,720
Got as far as getting everything set up and then left the room, which we'll be getting

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,080
into that later.

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,160
And then I played a little bit of pinball, played some Burning Crusade, well actually

63
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,480
I got as far as setting it up and then realizing I had to patch and then saying screw this

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,440
noise and not playing.

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:07,800
And I finally got my first badge in Pokemans, so yeah, while I was on the recumbent bike

66
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,220
at the gym.

67
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,520
The recumbent bike for people who are not gym savvy or vocabulary savvy means you sit

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,840
back on your ass and pedal in front of you.

69
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
What was that bike, Loki?

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,200
You would know this better in that one episode of South Park, Mr. Garrison invented the bike.

71
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,560
It was the It, I think.

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
The It?

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Yeah, remember because it was a parody of the Segway, which remember before that it

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,060
was called It.

75
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,040
I don't remember what it was called exactly.

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,300
Have you ever seen, they have like a Capri Sun commercial or something like that where

77
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,240
people are riding bikes that look exactly like that, so they do exist.

78
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,560
Okay, I know Dark Soccer doesn't watch a lot of TV, so you have no idea what I'm talking

79
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
about.

80
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
I don't watch TV at all.

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, that's not true because you watch Doctor Who.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,380
I downloaded it off the internet, but that's technically not watching TV, but I don't see

83
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,880
commercials or I'm not exposed to idiocy.

84
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,440
Alright, anyway, bear with me here for a minute.

85
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,600
There's this thing and Mr. Garrison invented it and you sit on this thing to make it run

86
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,720
and then you blow into a tube and when you talk about the recumbent bike, it makes it

87
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
sound like one of those.

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,320
But you're leaning forward and you lean back on a recumbent bike.

89
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,560
Alright, never mind.

90
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,280
The chat room agrees it's the It, so at least somebody will know what I'm talking about.

91
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Thank God.

92
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Anyway, sorry Dark Soccer.

93
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Okay, I want a Segway.

94
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,680
Rob, get me one.

95
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
No.

96
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Please.

97
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
No money.

98
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Oh, okay.

99
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,880
Getting you presents requires money that I don't have.

100
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,600
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,680
I meant to play all the E3 demos that were available on Xbox Live.

102
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,760
I just never got around to it.

103
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,160
I got around to downloading them, just not playing them, so that wasn't really helpful.

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
I did, well, let's see what I played this week.

105
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,960
I played more Saints Row multiplayer because we were still testing out the LAN stuff and

106
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,280
it works great now that I actually updated all the systems to have the multiplayer patch

107
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
on it.

108
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,560
So now it works awesome and it's pretty fun actually.

109
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,160
The other thing we tried was, the other thing I played more Earth Defense Force 2017 because

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
yes we're still not done with the game and it's getting pretty hard now because now we

111
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,840
have to play on Inferno.

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,960
So we finished a few things on that and then I'm playing more Final Fantasy on the PSP,

113
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,100
or Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories on PSP.

114
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,600
I do have stuff to play this week.

115
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:42,200
I just got a preview copy of Shimagami Tensei Persona 3, so I'm going to be playing that.

116
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,720
That'll be fun.

117
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
And then...

118
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,400
A lot of folks liked the last game that came out in that series, so...

119
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,120
Yeah, so it should be pretty good.

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,600
That's pretty much it for right now.

121
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm looking, hopefully this week, Paper Mario is going to be making its way out on our virtual

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,040
console because it's everywhere else, but you know, I want to play that now.

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,560
Because Super Paper Mario is pretty fun and I hear it's not really much different than

124
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,800
the original Paper Mario.

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you have information to back that up that is definitely coming out here Monday or are

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you just guessing?

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm just guessing.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm just guessing.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Alright.

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Fair enough.

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,480
Okay, well my gaming week, I also tried to download a bunch of those demos that came

132
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
out.

133
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,640
The first one I found playing was Blue Dragon, which, you know, I don't like having to read

134
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,480
walls of text to explain to me how to play the game.

135
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,480
I'm a bigger fan of those tutorials that kind of walks you through.

136
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,320
Maybe that's just my learning styles, I like to be kind of hands-on.

137
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,080
But I found in Blue Dragon, before you enter the room to start fighting monsters, you really

138
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,080
have to just read these wall of words that talk about the game and how the battle system

139
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
works.

140
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
And that doesn't really do it for me.

141
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,200
I like it when you fight a fight and then somebody comes in helping explain it to you

142
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
as you're fighting.

143
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I don't know.

144
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Maybe I'm just...

145
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,280
It might be just because it's the demo.

146
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
I'm hoping.

147
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
I'm really hoping.

148
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,080
And I would never want to base my judgment of an entire game off a demo, but it was very

149
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,320
hard for me to get into for that reason.

150
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,960
I felt like I wasn't really understanding everything that was going on.

151
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,820
But it does seem to have a pretty cool combat system.

152
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,040
It's somewhat a real-time system, but you can have your attacks stronger if you wait

153
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
longer.

154
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
It's interesting.

155
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,200
So I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product.

156
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,280
I'm such a fan of the Japanese RPGs, and especially, I'm interested in the products that Mistwalker

157
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
is putting out.

158
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm at least going to rent the darn game if I don't buy it.

159
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
That and Eternal Sonata and the other stuff that's coming out.

160
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
I hear it's three to sixteen.

161
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Blue Dragon?

162
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Really?

163
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Yeah.

164
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I thought it was only two.

165
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I thought it was three.

166
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Oh, well.

167
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
So there's that.

168
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,840
And as well, I downloaded Sonic on Arcade, which was a little silly because I have Sonic

169
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,080
on the Wii as well.

170
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
But I just kind of wanted to try it out to sort of see, okay, what's the differences

171
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
between the emulating on the Wii and the emulating on the Xbox 360?

172
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,840
And I'll tell you, the Xbox 360 one is actually a little bit better because it's not just

173
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
a straight-up port.

174
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,720
I mean, playing the Wii one does feel like you've whipped out your Genesis and hooked

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,080
it up and you're playing the real deal, but the Xbox 360 one, you can kind of not only

176
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,800
have that, just a straight-up emulation, but you can do the screen resizing.

177
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,160
You can do the smoothing graphics, which although it's an option, I don't think it looks that

178
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
good.

179
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
You have the online leaderboards.

180
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,760
There's a lot of little extra things that are kind of cool.

181
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,420
And to my mind, it's a better value for five bucks on the Xbox 360 than the eight bucks

182
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,220
it is on the Wii because of the fact that it was a Genesis title.

183
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,240
So I have to say, if you didn't buy Sonic on the Wii and you're a fan of the series,

184
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,680
you should definitely check out Sonic on the 360.

185
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,040
Golden Axe I checked out as well, but the problem is that Golden Axe is one of those

186
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,560
things that was much cooler when we were kids.

187
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,960
For me anyway.

188
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,960
The original Golden Axe was much cooler when we were kids, and yes, I know it's got a great

189
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,360
ending and everything, and the game was so much fun to play, co-op, but I just don't

190
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,280
see the magic there in this day and age playing it on the Xbox 360.

191
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,140
The game's very repetitive to me, and I think it's just one of those things that was much

192
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,280
cooler, watching the magic and everything when I was younger.

193
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Other than that, I...

194
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Yeah, go ahead.

195
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,240
I was going to say, you know what I'm really disappointed they haven't brought to the live

196
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,140
arcade yet is the Gauntlet Legends series.

197
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,560
That would have been cool.

198
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,840
I tried Gauntlet, not a big fan of the original Gauntlet, but Gauntlet Legends, I used to

199
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,200
go play that at the arcade all the time.

200
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,320
Gauntlet Legends is pretty rad.

201
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,840
I had the port on the N64 they made of that, and I had a lot of fun with that, because

202
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,700
that was a good party game as well.

203
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,560
Going to the chat room and looking at comments there, Pekor Uno says, Sonic is actually a

204
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,280
lot harder than I remembered it to be.

205
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,680
Yeah, I'm kind of finding the same thing.

206
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,880
I don't know, I'm finding this game is a lot harder than I remember it, but I used to be

207
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,160
better at video games when I was a kid than I am now in my old age.

208
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,960
Looking to see what other comments there are.

209
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Yeah, Darkseidra?

210
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,540
Sorry, I was talking about Gauntlet 64 really makes me want to play the old Gauntlet now.

211
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
The old school one?

212
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,540
Oh, hell yeah!

213
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,200
See, that's another one of those games that I have better memories of as a kid.

214
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I don't know why.

215
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,480
Like, you know, of course we all remember that Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and all

216
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,240
this will say, don't shoot food.

217
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,120
I just have this urge now to go back and play Gauntlet and Mile in Secret Castle, and, oh,

218
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,000
shit, Marble Madness.

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll give you this.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,560
I think going back and playing a game like Gauntlet is much more fun with four people.

221
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,080
Well, yeah, that's what I mean.

222
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,760
When you have everybody there playing all the old school stuff, that's fun.

223
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,120
I don't have a lot of friends, so I don't get to play the old school.

224
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,280
You know we didn't play Super Metroid on Thursday?

225
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
We didn't.

226
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
We didn't.

227
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,320
So you have to play Super Metroid with me this week.

228
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Absolutely.

229
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,440
You know, it's funny you mention that, because I did play, I had jury duty this week.

230
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Suck.

231
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Poor Rob.

232
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,840
Yeah, they called me back 13 months after I was there before.

233
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,600
Long time listeners of OLR may remember, I was on like a two week case last year.

234
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,080
But I went back this year, and thank God I didn't get called, but I had to sit around

235
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,620
all day long waiting to see if they'd call me.

236
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,340
I played Metroid Zero Mission, like all day, which, you know, is the next best thing to

237
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,280
Super Metroid on the Game Boy Advance, or in my case, the DS.

238
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,600
But all I could play was the one Advance game I had in the slot, because I lost the stylus

239
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,000
to my DS Fat, which my DS Lite was uncharged.

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,720
Fuck that, use your finger.

241
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
That's what I'd be doing.

242
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Screw it.

243
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Finger works just as well.

244
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Metroid Zero Mission is pretty awesome.

245
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
I didn't want to play puzzle.

246
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,840
I know originally you're thinking, hey, oh crap, it's going to get the screen all messed

247
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
up and stuff.

248
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Now fuck it, who cares.

249
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,640
You can just rub it on your shirt, it's all good.

250
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,680
SSJ100Matt says, wow, back to jury duty.

251
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,440
Yeah, unfortunately, Pauly Shore wasn't there, though.

252
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Or you know what?

253
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,480
Those pencils that they make, you fill out the forms or pens or whatever the fuck that

254
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,360
they have, use one of those.

255
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,000
Just fucking turn that shit around or, I don't know, pen cap or something.

256
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Get creative.

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,600
All right, so that's pretty much all the games I really played this week, so some new stuff

258
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,880
thanks to the marketplace and some old stuff thanks to my lack of a stylus for the DS.

259
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,720
I played one more game this week, and it's kind of, we'll get into later on with some

260
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,760
other discussion, but I played Motorstorm again, and apparently there's a code out there

261
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,800
now that unlocks everything, so I did that thinking, hey, you know, it's been a while

262
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
since I played this.

263
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,520
I was frustrated with how hard the game was, you know, certain races, your bike or whatever,

264
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,560
the physics were really bugging me.

265
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't like Motorstorm anymore.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,800
I think it's actually really boring, and you know, before it was pretty good, but now it's

267
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
just kind of dumb.

268
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,720
I seem to recall this is the second week in a row you've changed your mind on a game.

269
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,480
Have you gotten finicky in your older age?

270
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,720
I don't know, but you know, I know later on, well, last week we talked about the 88 system

271
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,040
or whatever that they were releasing for the PlayStation 3 with Motorstorm bundled in.

272
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,240
You know, I would rather it be Resistance, I think.

273
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
You know, just Motorstorm, it's a cool game.

274
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,560
Like when the demo was out and stuff, everyone was like, oh, I got to get the game, but then

275
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,400
you play it, and it's just the layout's not very good, and the races are kind of, eh,

276
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
I don't know.

277
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
All right.

278
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,200
Well, like Loki said, we'll get to plenty of Sony talk a little later in the show, actually

279
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,400
probably in part B tonight, because we are going to tackle the avalanche of news that

280
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
came out of E3.

281
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,440
Now, we know you guys probably already read a ton about E3.

282
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,200
You know, you guys that subscribe to the show are obviously video gaming fans, so you might

283
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
know a lot already about what we're going to talk about tonight.

284
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,080
We hope we picked up some stuff that maybe didn't blip on your radar, but tonight is

285
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,200
really about kind of the feedback from the outside looking in, because think about it.

286
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,640
Everything you've read on the internet to date is people that were there, people that

287
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:29,360
were, you know, getting to, you know, the breakfasts provided by the staff and the shuttles

288
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,320
going from hotel to hotel and everything.

289
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,320
You know, we're kind of trying to look at, okay, so how does everybody else feel that

290
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,960
wasn't there at E3, because, you know, we're the ones that are really going to be buying

291
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,440
all this stuff that they were selling.

292
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,880
You know, this is going to be kind of weird, you know, but overall in general, the layout

293
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,200
and the way that they did E3 this year, I actually like it more than I did the original

294
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,760
E3.

295
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,520
And the reason being is because it's a lot easier to digest.

296
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,560
Instead of having to, you know, make your way through all the booths, set up all these

297
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,320
appointments, you know, to meet with these publishers or whatever and see their games

298
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
and stuff.

299
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,680
Now it's just, okay, go to press conference to press conference.

300
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,600
It's just like a gamer's day and it makes it a lot easier, I think, and then you get

301
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,800
your hands on time afterwards.

302
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,320
I like that.

303
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,500
Can I share a rumor I heard with you from Bobby's show this week?

304
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,480
Because Bobby apparently talked to someone and he won't say who it is, which of course

305
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,800
when you hear this you'll completely understand why.

306
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,080
But Bobby Blackwolf, our old buddy over at AllGames.com, gets complete credit for this

307
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
story because I'm stealing it from him.

308
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,060
So listen to his show, Bobby Blackwolf's show and all that stuff.

309
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,180
So here's what he said on his show this week is that apparently he was talking to somebody

310
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,760
and the reason why they had to keep E3 in LA this year was because of contracts.

311
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,480
They had already signed a contract with the city to have this convention and it's all

312
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,960
basically based on the number of hotel nights they guarantee that the city's going to get

313
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
from it.

314
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,420
It's kind of about the kickback or the revenue, thank you, for the city that they're going

315
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,420
to get from this.

316
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,600
Well, the thing is this is why they're going to have E4ALL is because they moved E3 to

317
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,480
Santa Monica, which is still in LA County, and made it a smaller event.

318
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,280
But E4ALL was supposed to pick up consumers now and bring in revenue from that.

319
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,280
So they were still going to meet their numbers that they originally signed off to.

320
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:20,200
But according to Bobby in a show this week, E4ALL I should say is not living up to expectations

321
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,320
as far as the pre-sales are concerned and not a lot of companies are really interested

322
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,640
in going at this point.

323
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,360
Nintendo's really the only one that's on board, Microsoft don't give a shit.

324
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,120
So there is a strong chance that they may opt to take the fine and just cancel E4ALL.

325
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,040
There's a very strong chance that E4ALL is just going to get axed in favor of just paying

326
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,220
a fine and saying cut our losses.

327
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:48,080
But that would mean E3, if it continues next year, which may not happen, the ESA may just

328
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,240
back out of the show biz altogether.

329
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,840
If the ESA backs out of this, then either the ESA is going to back out or E3 is going

330
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
to move to another city.

331
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,520
And, of course, we've heard rumors that they get the possibility...

332
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
San Francisco!

333
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
San Francisco!

334
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I would be expensive!

335
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
San Francisco!

336
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
San Francisco is freaking expensive!

337
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
I don't care!

338
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Sacramento!

339
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Damn cheap!

340
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Where they had an LA.

341
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Yeah, that's true.

342
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,800
San Francisco is probably just as expensive as LA and worse traffic.

343
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Sacramento!

344
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
It's dirt cheap!

345
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Good luck!

346
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Come on!

347
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,680
You can come out here and burn to death.

348
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Good luck.

349
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
I know, it's like 106 degrees this whole week.

350
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,920
This is really a minor summer in comparison.

351
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
But Sacramento!

352
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Then I can go!

353
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
San Jose!

354
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
That's a good idea!

355
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
That's a good idea!

356
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
San Jose!

357
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
I'd go to Vegas!

358
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Come on!

359
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
You guys afraid of planes?

360
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
San Jose or Santa Clara would be pretty good too.

361
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Middle Silicon Valley?

362
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Yeah.

363
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
No, we'll see.

364
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,400
Anyway, I hope E4ALL didn't get canceled.

365
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,520
I was kind of looking forward to going, but then again, if there's not going to be much

366
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,280
support, maybe I shouldn't be so excited.

367
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
I don't know.

368
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,560
It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next few days and what the fallout is.

369
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,880
Floridien says, what about PAX?

370
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,680
Pinning Arcade Expo, of course.

371
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,100
A lot of folks see PAX as one of those expos that's stepping up to fill in the void left

372
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,880
by the old E3.

373
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,580
Banda in chat,.orangelandtrader.com says, fuck E3!

374
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,840
I can't wait for X07-08!

375
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,240
All right, anyway, I just wanted to share that little tidbit rumor thing with you guys.

376
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Other housekeeping tonight?

377
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Oh, yes.

378
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,320
One thing is that I think that I'm going to adopt DarkTetsu's nickname for Kazurai and

379
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,960
call him Captain Crayola.

380
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Captain Crayola?

381
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Yes.

382
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
All right.

383
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,240
Anyway, let's get into some housekeeping for today.

384
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,560
First thing I want to say is a big thank you to the folks at SacAnime for having us at

385
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,640
their show at the last minute.

386
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,340
We did tape a special show there.

387
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,560
It's not going to go into our regular RSS feed, though.

388
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,640
We recorded about a 45-minute thing Saturday morning, pretty early, and we're going to

389
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,840
be putting that on our live journal and MySpace and I guess Facebook communities.

390
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,000
Basically any Orange Lawns Radio community will post the link to the MP3, but because

391
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,120
of the fact that we also talk about E3 and that, and even though it's a little more,

392
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,600
I don't know how to phrase it, it's going to be a little more lax than even what you're

393
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,400
going to hear tonight, because of kind of the duplicate news there, we're not going

394
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,080
to post the same show to the feed, so it's out there, but it was kind of our initial

395
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,200
reactions to a lot of the E3 news, and there were some funny jokes that came out of it,

396
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,240
so if you're a fan of OLR, definitely check out the bonus show this week.

397
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,280
And I think that's about all I wanted to say for housekeeping, so let's kick it off.

398
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,400
Let's start.

399
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,160
First press conference at E3 this week was Microsoft, so let's start with some Microsoft

400
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
news.

401
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,880
So Microsoft, they had a lot of bombs to drop, of course, and this is a huge surprise because

402
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,440
they did this with Halo 2, but they announced that a special 360 console, Halo themed, will

403
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,920
be hitting the market in September.

404
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,400
No word on the price yet.

405
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,960
Some interesting things about it though is it will be, of course, the camo green.

406
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,720
It's going to have a controller and a plain charge kit, also that camo green, I guess

407
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,520
they call it Spartan green.

408
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,080
It's going to have a 20 gig hard drive, just like a premium system, but it's going to have

409
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:01,120
HDMI just like an Elite, so the question is, how much is it going to cost?

410
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,160
And the answer for Microsoft, we're not telling you yet, but soon.

411
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,880
But the answer is $30 more than what it should cost because of the Halo propaganda that will

412
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,600
be splattered all over this thing, right?

413
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Am I right?

414
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
I guess.

415
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,440
But I mean, this only joins, you know, what, their two custom controllers that they have

416
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:27,200
right now with Todd McFarlane art and collectible figurines, you know, a wireless headset, and

417
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,400
also their points cards, I believe, their three month cards are now Halo themed.

418
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,360
It's just, it's overload is what it is.

419
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
But hey!

420
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
People will buy it.

421
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,280
Halo 3 Saturation, GS191 in chat says, that's one ugly Xbox 360.

422
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,200
I agree, it was ugly.

423
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay, I don't think it was that ugly, it's not that bad, but here's the thing though.

424
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,840
If you're really looking to buy an Elite or something because of the HDMI, but you don't

425
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,540
really want to spend the $479, this might be a cheaper alternative for you.

426
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,800
But is HDMI that big a difference?

427
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Didn't we talk before?

428
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
It's really not.

429
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,160
It's not that big a difference, but there are some people out there that have video

430
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,360
files that really want the HDMI stuff, so.

431
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Oh my God!

432
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,960
If you're going to pay that much money just to have that itty bitty, itty bitty bitty

433
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,920
difference between, you know, the normal composite out and the HDMI, I mean seriously, question

434
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,320
your priorities.

435
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,840
Donate the money to OLR, we'll make good use out of the money.

436
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,680
Maybe it can send us to Vegas for next year's E3, I don't know.

437
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,440
Well here's the thing, I would just wait and see because later on they're going to be dropping

438
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,680
the price of the 360 anyways, and you know, I want to bet that maybe they're going to

439
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,240
add HDMI to all of the Xbox 360s at some point, because I believe the Elite is only a limited

440
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,120
time thing anyways.

441
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,040
Alright, well for the record, I actually have a Halo 2 Xbox 360, or a Halo, or I'm sorry,

442
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,720
a Halo Xbox minus the 360, and they're pretty.

443
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,360
They're green and you can see through them.

444
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,760
They're green and see-through, and you know, compared to...

445
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,080
When our first Xbox died, that's what we got.

446
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,000
Compared to, like the first Xbox was ugly, so the Halo one was kind of cool, but this

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,480
grey one doesn't do it for me, I have to say.

448
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
It's not grey, it's green.

449
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Whatever.

450
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Grey green.

451
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,920
It looks like the color of sadness, I don't know.

452
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,160
It's translucent.

453
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
It looks like violence.

454
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Alright, whatever.

455
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
And violence sells.

456
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,280
Alright, I'm not buying this 360.

457
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,600
I don't need HDMI that badly.

458
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:29,680
I already have an Elite anyway, so I don't care, and if I want my HDMI, I'll just play

459
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
my PS3.

460
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,720
Anyway, though speaking of HD, this is kind of cool.

461
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,320
Disney is actually going to have their movies available in high definition through the download

462
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,560
service on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

463
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,880
That's pretty cool, which I actually think is kind of funny given that they've been pretty

464
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,600
Blu-ray oriented, but hey.

465
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,700
I thought that was kind of interesting too for that exact same reason, is that Disney's

466
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,640
been kind of Blu-ray oriented, but now here they go with the Xbox service, where Xbox

467
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,600
has kind of been with HD DVD, but I guess it's really apples to oranges.

468
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
You can't really compare the two.

469
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,620
Yeah, but I think Disney's both, actually.

470
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,640
They do both Blu-ray and HD DVD.

471
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,800
No, they're exclusive to Blu-ray.

472
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,480
There's a few that do both.

473
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,000
However, I think this is their way of getting out of the exclusive thing, is by having their

474
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,600
movies available for download, they can have it available to both formats and still say

475
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
exclusive Blu-ray.

476
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
You know what?

477
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,920
And the other thing too is, okay, they sell another rental of their movie.

478
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,960
It's pure profit for them.

479
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,560
It's just a digital file that someone downloads.

480
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,820
They don't even have to make anything for it, so I don't see why it's win-win for them.

481
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,400
So when you hear Disney put their movies on Xbox 360, my mind automatically goes to the

482
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,240
animated classics, and I go, ooh, I can go download The Little Mermaid on my 360, but

483
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,800
it's not quite like that, right?

484
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:54,360
Actually, there are some of the stuff on there, Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure

485
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Planet.

486
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,360
It was a crap movie anyway.

487
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,240
Well, this is just their initial offering.

488
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
Tarzan was okay.

489
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,080
When they put Tron on there, though, let me know.

490
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,480
But having Rosie O'Donnell as a gorilla was pretty funny.

491
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,640
Though, if they did Tron HD, ha.

492
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,600
Heck, ooh, maybe they will in time because we know we're getting the games on Xbox Live

493
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,400
Marketplace, so maybe, maybe.

494
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,000
Anyway, but I just want to say it's a lot of Disney's subsidiaries as well, like Miramax

495
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,720
and Touchtone are putting their movies out too.

496
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Clerks, please.

497
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,120
Clerks animated series, please.

498
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:32,120
All right, anyhow, also what you will be able to download soon on Xbox Live Arcade are a

499
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,480
lot of new Xbox Live Arcade games.

500
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,200
They showed this little trailer at E3 that showed a whole lot of new Xbox Live Arcade

501
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,120
games, including the stuff that you can now download right away, Son of the Hedgehog and

502
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Golden Axe.

503
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,640
But here's some new stuff that's coming out.

504
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,480
Next week is Bomberman Live, they've already announced that.

505
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,760
Undertow, Hexic 2, which is, am I, is that the, that was the sequel to Hexen, right?

506
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
That's the sequel to Hexic.

507
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Oh, never owned a puzzle game.

508
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,280
Hexen was the secret to Heretic.

509
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,200
Ah, crap, never mind, okay.

510
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,000
Hexen, you can turn people into chickens.

511
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Damn it.

512
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That was great.

513
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,880
Because I, when I first saw that, I was like, oh, because I thought it was like the sequel

514
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,040
to the Doom game, but I'm just stupid.

515
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:19,840
Okay, then we have Warworld, Sensible World of Soccer, Every Extend Extra Extreme, Gion,

516
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,360
Wing Commander Arena, Feeding Frenzy 2, Track and Field, Spyglass Board Games, Space Giraffe,

517
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Battle Fighter 2, HD Turbo Remix, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah, blah, Marathon, Poker

518
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,960
Smash, Switch Ball, Tetris Splash, Puzzle Quest.

519
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Oh, that's a lot.

520
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,560
Switch Ball is supposed to be just like Marble Madness, apparently.

521
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,880
And that doesn't mention the Battlestar Galactica game either, which, per Kotaku, sucks.

522
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,040
So that's kind of sad, if the Battlestar Galactica game sucks, because I was really looking forward

523
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
to that.

524
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Wing Commander game sucks too, from what I hear.

525
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,720
So stop making Space Combat Arena games.

526
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,320
Sadness.

527
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,680
What they should be making is more space RPGs, like Mass Effect, which is coming in November,

528
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,240
and is supposed to be the, you know, I guess the cat's meow or whatever you would say.

529
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,720
It's going to be fucking awesome, is basically it, and it should be, you know, it's BioWare.

530
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:19,800
Also coming in September will be Project Gotham Racing 4, which in itself is also pretty impressive.

531
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,280
I don't know, Project Gotham Racing 3 was pretty cool.

532
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,520
I don't know if I'll get 4, though.

533
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,880
I can't control the cars in that.

534
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
I suck at those type of games.

535
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,080
I keep crashing into walls.

536
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
Yeah.

537
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
I don't know how to drive.

538
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,720
Yeah, I get all woman when I play those games.

539
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,840
I can't drive.

540
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,560
Die.

541
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,800
But Mass Effect.

542
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,200
I looked at the trailer for Mass Effect.

543
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,360
I think I got a semi.

544
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,400
That was a real hot trailer.

545
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
That game looks awesome.

546
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,240
Now, when you saw Mass Effect, didn't you, now, for like half a second I thought, you

547
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,480
know, Phantasy Star Online could have been this good if they had actually tried, you

548
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
know?

549
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,000
This is like what Phantasy Star Online should have been, but instead Phantasy Star Online

550
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,680
gave us, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

551
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,920
Sorry, please listen to the theme of Phantasy Star Online if you don't get my joke, or Phantasy

552
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,880
Star Universe, whatever the hell it is.

553
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,520
But no, Mass Effect looks great.

554
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:25,680
It looks like V, or some type of epic mini-series movie that's coming soon to the sci-fi network,

555
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
but in HD.

556
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,760
It's going to be pretty epic, too.

557
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,500
This is only the first of the trilogy, I believe, for it.

558
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,760
So it will be a pretty long story, and hell, just make a movie out of it.

559
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,840
I mean, it looks like a movie already, so.

560
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,240
I heard that the conversation style in it is really cool, like you use the thumbsticks

561
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,160
to talk live, like you basically have to choose an option while the other person is kind of

562
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,920
talking or whatever, and then that can have an effect on the conversation, so that sounds

563
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
kind of neat.

564
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:57,480
I say they take the Mass Effect engine and give us another Space Quest.

565
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,320
I guess anything is possible.

566
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,680
Who knows what might happen?

567
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:08,440
Well, there's actually a good thing that's going to happen for our friends overseas.

568
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,400
In Europe, the Xbox 360 Elite will be out on the 24th of August, which actually was

569
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,220
released, the information was released at E3, of course.

570
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,560
There's not a price listed, speculation is that it will be close to what it costs over

571
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,940
here in the US.

572
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,920
So congratulations to Europe, even though you have to wait for things a little later,

573
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,760
at least you're finally getting your Xbox 360 Elite.

574
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
If you want it.

575
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
If you want it, yeah, if you care.

576
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,720
And if you can find it, because I know the ones over here are practically sold out everywhere

577
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
because...

578
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,640
Make friends with people who work at video game shops.

579
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,520
I guess producing that larger hard drive is a real challenge out there, you know, slapping

580
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,680
that laptop drive into a little case.

581
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
Oui.

582
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,880
Well, one thing you might play on your new Xbox 360 Elite is Seen It.

583
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,840
Of course, this is a big announcement that Microsoft made at their press conference this

584
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,000
year is that they're going to be putting out a casual game called Seen It.

585
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,640
Now, you might have heard of Seen It before.

586
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,040
It's a really popular DVD board game.

587
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,400
I don't know if they have this outside of the US, if they have this in other countries.

588
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Basically it's a board game and you play it with a DVD.

589
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,880
I've played this before.

590
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,600
You watch like little clips from movies and you're supposed to answer trivia questions

591
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,080
based off the clips that you see from the movies.

592
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,680
And it works together with the board.

593
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,460
It would actually make a really great downloadable game, I think, and it's a pretty good casual

594
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
game.

595
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,040
But is it enough to suddenly turn the Xbox 360 into a casual gaming system?

596
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,260
I don't know.

597
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,480
But I guess it's a start.

598
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,800
Like Uno didn't?

599
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,040
Well, I guess Uno was another attempt.

600
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,280
But what have we really had since Uno?

601
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,000
It's like pure casual.

602
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Maybe the solitaire game.

603
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't know.

604
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Texas Hold'em?

605
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,280
But nothing's really caught on like Uno has.

606
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
Well, maybe Hold'em.

607
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,080
I guess I'll give you that.

608
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,960
I think if you really want to reach the casual gaming audience, make your system a lot cheaper

609
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,120
and then they will come because of the price cuts because it will look more attractive.

610
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,880
There you go.

611
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,320
There's a new controller, by the way, that will come with CNET, and it's a controller

612
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,200
so simple that even your grandma can use it.

613
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,460
It's one giant button and four little buttons to use for the answers.

614
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,760
And apparently the game is going to come with four of these controllers, which is kind of

615
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
interesting.

616
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,480
And the funny thing, too, is it's ripped off of the controller from the Buzz game series,

617
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,600
which looks almost identical to that one.

618
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,040
Some other things coming out from, of course, the Microsoft press conference.

619
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,740
A few more game announcements.

620
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,960
They announced Viva Pinata Party Animals because the first game was just so awesome that they

621
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,360
had to release a party game for it, and apparently it's going to combine both racing and mini

622
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,600
games, kind of similar to like a Mario Kart meets Mario Party, and that's due out in November.

623
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,920
Also they announced some other stuff.

624
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,200
Some more games will be joining the Games for Windows lineup.

625
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,760
Gears of War and Viva Pinata.

626
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,400
Gears of War is actually supposed to have some additional content for it as well, which

627
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:15,080
I imagine would be probably downloadable here on the Xbox 360 probably around the same time.

628
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,320
And other things, Call of Duty 4, they announced that they're going to be doing an exclusive

629
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,720
online beta with Xbox 360.

630
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,120
No details on what's going to be involved with that since they haven't launched these

631
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,680
sign ups yet, but hopefully know more about that soon since the game does come out in

632
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
November.

633
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,640
Another thing, which kind of joining the whole multiple colored accessories trend here, they're

634
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,320
going to be releasing pink and blue controllers in October.

635
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,800
I don't know why, but they are.

636
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,200
Also the Xbox Messenger is going to be coming in September, that thing that's going to attach

637
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,020
to the bottom for text messaging for Windows Messenger.

638
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,160
And then if you didn't have a chance to go to E3, there's some pretty cool stuff on Xbox

639
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:13,200
Live Marketplace for you, some new demos including Blue Dragon, Ace Combat 6, NCAA Football 08,

640
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,620
Stuntman Ignition, The Bigs, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

641
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,600
So let's go around and talk about Microsoft's Preface Conference and sort of your guys'

642
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,880
reaction to it.

643
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,080
And I'll pose this question to Chad as well, we'll read some of your comments.

644
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,160
Were you happy with Microsoft's conference?

645
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,440
Was there more you were looking for?

646
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,800
And if you could, I don't know, I'll throw this totally arbitrary thing out there.

647
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,340
If you could rate the press conference on a scale of 1 to 10, what would you give it?

648
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,820
So I'm going to say this right off the bat, and I think this goes for all of us.

649
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,600
Where was the anticipated price cut?

650
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,760
Do you think Microsoft's kind of waiting to make a response to this?

651
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,680
It was indisposed.

652
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,400
They were on record commenting saying that to announce a price cut in July is really

653
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
bad timing.

654
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,880
They didn't understand why Sony made that announcement, if you can call it an announcement.

655
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,560
They said that they hinted that they will be making an announcement closer to the fall.

656
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,920
Well I think we might have more on that later in the show, so we'll see.

657
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,040
Anyway, Loki, did you like it, did you not like the conference, what would you say?

658
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,160
I would say that they set an example of what their conferences should be like.

659
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,360
It's basically, they said here, all the games we're going to show you are going to be coming

660
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,080
out this year.

661
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,540
That's how you fucking do it.

662
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,160
You say here's our lineup for this fall, get excited, it's going to be out in a few months.

663
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,640
As opposed to certain other companies that said here's what's coming out, I forgot to

664
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,740
mention that most of that is going to be next year, late next year, if not later, stuff

665
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,740
like that.

666
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,800
I forgot that they really hit the nail on the head with that stuff, and there's not

667
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,560
really much more I could want from it.

668
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,720
It was a little bit disappointing that certain games were announced also coming through their

669
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,560
platform, but they're going to have a really solid lineup.

670
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,200
Certain other publishers and hardware makers are going to have a hard time catching up

671
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,000
if something magical doesn't happen in the fourth quarter.

672
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,240
So I would say probably give them an eight or nine.

673
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
All right.

674
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,640
Dark Sakura, care to give your two cents on what happened?

675
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:35,320
Well, given that you two covered most of my same thought on it, really, I don't know,

676
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,880
I'm still in, I actually, I think that they are going to do the, I think actually I agree

677
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,520
that it was smart for them not to announce a price drop, that if they put something like

678
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:52,280
that more out public around Christmas or right after Thanksgiving for the Christmas rush,

679
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,960
then that will, I think, be more of a reason for consumers to go out and get one then.

680
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't think there's a need that they'd be, they don't need to really announce a

681
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,440
price cut right now anyways because they're going into a really strong fourth quarter.

682
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,000
It's not like that their system's not number one selling right now in the United States.

683
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,400
They don't really need any extra momentum right now.

684
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,120
They need to see what the fourth quarter's like and then right at the prime moment, boom,

685
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,680
and then just hit the Christmas rush right there.

686
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,000
I think that's what they're going to end up doing.

687
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,460
Okay, well I guess my thoughts on it, I don't know, like I kind of would like to know what's

688
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,520
going to be the big thing that I should be excited about after Halo 3.

689
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,040
Like I was kind of hoping there might be a little hint of what's to come in 2008.

690
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,800
I mean I guess I understand the strategy of putting all the cards in, what?

691
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
They did.

692
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,760
They talked about Halo Wars, they were talking about Lost Odyssey, Mass Effect.

693
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,880
Mass Effect is this year.

694
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,000
I know, but it's after Halo 3.

695
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Grand Theft Auto 4, beautiful Katamari, I mean there's a big lineup that's not just

696
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,560
Halo 3.

697
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,000
There was nothing that had me running around screaming and excited.

698
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,840
You know, like in years past, there's usually somebody that releases something that makes

699
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,040
me go, ooh, that was really cool.

700
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,040
But Microsoft's conference for me was just kind of like, yeah, I kind of saw that coming.

701
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
Yeah, I kind of saw that coming.

702
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Yeah, I figured they'd show that.

703
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,400
It was all stuff that was previously announced, and the stuff that they, this is the first

704
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,120
time we're announcing, Viva Piñata party, and I was like, I don't fucking care.

705
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:25,200
I mean the scene thing is a good effort, I suppose, but it's not enough to make you go,

706
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,720
wow, you're really going to win with that.

707
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,200
I was like, ooh, it's neat because I'm in the movie industry, so that's kind of neat.

708
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,980
That'd be kind of fun to play at work.

709
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,920
I wasn't thinking, ooh, I've got to go get me one of those.

710
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,160
No, I don't think so.

711
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,360
I would maybe rate the conference like a six and a half.

712
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
I don't know.

713
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,320
It's better than middle of the road, but not by much.

714
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,840
There was nothing that made me go, hooray, or maybe give me a gamer fang as it was mostly,

715
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
okay, I figured that was coming.

716
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I figured that was coming.

717
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
I figured that was coming.

718
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
That's just me, personally.

719
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Let's go to chat.

720
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,440
Let's see what some chat folks thought there.

721
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,960
Lots of you guys here in chat commenting on it.

722
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,720
DJ Tyrant says, Microsoft's conference should have addressed the rings of death issue much

723
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
much more.

724
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
No.

725
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
What do they need?

726
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Here's the other thing.

727
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Why would they bring attention to that?

728
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Why would they even need to address that?

729
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
They've already addressed that.

730
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm just reading someone else's thoughts.

731
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,040
Well, I'm answering to that.

732
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
We're expanding.

733
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,520
Listen, I'm expanding on this, okay, and I'm tired of people complaining about it, and

734
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,400
no, I'm not a fucking Microsoft fanboy, but here's the thing.

735
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,020
They're dealing with the problem.

736
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,980
Your consoles now have a three year warranty on them from the announcement date.

737
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,880
They're going to fix any of them for free, and they've already fixed the problem and

738
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,880
new consoles being manufactured right now, so what part of it are they not doing anything

739
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
about?

740
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
That's what I want to know.

741
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,240
There's no reason to even mention that stuff because, okay, and actually Peter Moore did

742
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,720
announce, okay, yeah, we made a mistake, but we're taking care of it.

743
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
All right.

744
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Enough said.

745
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,480
SSJ100Matt says, Microsoft's conference was basically the status quo.

746
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Not that many surprises.

747
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
B in my mind.

748
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,260
I would think the status quo would be a C. No, that's all right.

749
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,600
In the gaming industry, we always inflate scores a little bit, right?

750
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,240
Let's see.

751
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,520
DDRDollarBill says, I wish achievement points meant something.

752
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Whatever happened to the whole- You win a no prize.

753
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,760
What happened to the whole thing?

754
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,360
Remember they had the old spice inflate your gamer score challenge, and you could win actual

755
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,760
... Whatever happened to that?

756
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,480
It just kind of disappeared.

757
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,200
I agree.

758
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,420
They need a little boost there, but- That could have been something that they could

759
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,480
have talked about that might have gotten me a little more excited.

760
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,960
I don't know.

761
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,680
TheRobD says, I got to agree with Loki on Microsoft's press conference.

762
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,120
This is a good example of how they should do a press conference.

763
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,800
I just wish they would have announced some worthwhile stuff.

764
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,520
DJDarknight says, Call of Duty 4 totally won me over.

765
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,920
And ShadowNextGen disagrees with Rob D and says, I thought Microsoft announced a great

766
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
lineup.

767
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,520
Did they show Fable 2 at the conference?

768
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,320
Yeah, it was at the conference briefly.

769
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,520
Briefly, but not a whole lot.

770
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,960
It's not coming for a while.

771
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,400
Now that's a game I'm getting a little more excited about the more I hear about it, but

772
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,800
they didn't say a lot.

773
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,900
What I was reading about it was coming from stuff outside the conference, like behind

774
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,760
closed doors type stuff.

775
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,140
Anyway, so there you go.

776
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,440
There's a wrap up on Microsoft.

777
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,600
Now before we get into some of the other companies, I want to ask real quick, because we didn't

778
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,840
really cover it in the gaming week, but we did talk about how we were at SacAnime, and

779
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,380
I wanted to ask Dark Soccer how the rest of the convention went.

780
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,280
If you met any listeners of the program, or what kind of stuff was there game wise, or

781
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
what you did?

782
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,880
I walked in with my doll feed this morning, and got attacked by doll feed people.

783
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,560
So hi everybody that I met at the convention who was into doll feeds, and my poor doll

784
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:47,040
got petted quite a bit, and that was really it, and then I bought a dollick.

785
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:54,280
I spent most of the time in the dealer's room, but I'd have to say that I didn't watch any

786
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:01,760
anime, I didn't really meet anybody except for Warrior Bob, and Andrew was there, and

787
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,640
I bought a dollick, and I bought a heartless plushie.

788
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,320
Because isn't that what conventions are about, buying crap just because you want it?

789
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:16,160
I bought a Starman keychain for Mario, and a boo, and a coin box and a fire flower.

790
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,680
Not a bad sized convention for this town, considering we just had a big one in the Bay

791
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Area.

792
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,360
It would be better than the Japantown Anime Fair, actually.

793
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,180
The only good thing about the Japantown Anime Fair is that they had better cosplay.

794
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,040
There was good cosplay, don't get me wrong, Sac Anime is going to grow.

795
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,660
It's going to be bigger, we're going to have a real, real big convention.

796
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,920
Everybody was great, the staff was fantastic.

797
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:48,440
Honestly I was very ill-prepared for it, given that I've just come off anime, so I almost

798
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,560
cosplayed the doctor, Shadow Next Gen. I wish I had thought about the free donuts

799
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,040
and orange juice earlier so we could have promoted that and maybe got a few more people

800
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
in there.

801
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,080
You know, we had a bad time.

802
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,060
That's my only complaint, is that we had a bad time for the panel.

803
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,360
Had we had later, it would have been just fine.

804
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,640
But I kind of see this as, you know, you put in your year of good faith, doing it and showing

805
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,880
up on time and everything, and then maybe in January, because this is a twice-yearly

806
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,840
con, maybe in January we'll get something a little better, because they'll remember

807
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,520
us, you know, that we were good troopers and got up early at the crack of dawn this year.

808
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
So who knows.

809
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Yeah, we're not doing that next year.

810
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Yeah, that kind of ruined my sabbath.

811
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,800
Yeah, these guys are suckers, they'll fill in that one time slot no one wants again.

812
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Nope.

813
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
It was good though.

814
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Next year, primetime.

815
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,160
Wow, you guys are turning into divas.

816
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,760
No, we want to seriously say that, thanks for having us.

817
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,060
I love A-1 Comics now, even though they're local, because I got my Dalek for a lot less

818
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,000
expensive than eBay had it.

819
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,360
It's probably the same one I saw in their store that I called to tell you about.

820
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
It is.

821
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Oh, how funny.

822
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
All right.

823
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,500
Anyhow, speaking of which, you know, I'll kind of put that call out there again.

824
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,240
If you are planning a convention, you know, somewhere on the West Coast within a reasonable

825
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,720
travel distance, or you want to go real crazy and fly us out, I mean, no, we won't not hear

826
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,500
any reasonable requests, but especially at Bay Area, Central Valley conventions, or even

827
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,000
Southern California, we'll, you know, consider anything, and we like to get out there and

828
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
promote our show.

829
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
That's how we do it.

830
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So get in touch with us.

831
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Get in touch with us at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

832
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
All right.

833
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,280
Anyhow, let's move on.

834
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,600
Before we get into Nintendo's conference, let's talk release dates real quick, because

835
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,800
we like to cover what's going to be coming out in the gaming world with our release dates.

836
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,680
Jamie, why don't you start us off?

837
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:31,500
Well, for our friends in the UK, we have a few things coming out within this week.

838
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,680
On the 18th, we have Bomberman Live for Xbox 360, and the 20th, we have The Darkness, Transformers

839
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,080
the Game, and Two Worlds for Xbox 360 and PC.

840
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
That's it.

841
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,120
Kind of a slow week for release dates, just because everything, you know, it's going on,

842
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,120
but...

843
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,880
Everyone's still, you know, crapping their pants over E3.

844
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,560
Well, over in Japan, they have some stuff to look forward to.

845
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,240
I love the cover art for this game on the Wii.

846
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,000
Momotaru Densetsu 16 is coming out on July 19th over in Japan.

847
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,280
It looks like a little train conductor game, like maybe like an A-train type thing, or

848
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,600
Sim City, one of those, like, simulation games.

849
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,960
That looks cute.

850
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,600
Coming out on the PlayStation 2, Shonen Oyouji Tsubasa Yoima Teni Kare is coming out on July

851
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,240
19th, 2007.

852
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,000
Looks like a little adventure game, probably based off yet another anime.

853
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,360
You know, this series, Ultraman Fighting Evolution 3, is coming out on the PlayStation 2, also

854
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,560
on July 19th, although I believe that is simply a price reduction, not just a brand new game.

855
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
But hey, it's Ultraman.

856
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,960
I had to mention it.

857
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,400
Cinnamon Ball, Kurukuru Sweets Paradise.

858
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
That's awesome.

859
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,200
I have two pillows for that.

860
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,360
That's exactly what it is.

861
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,840
It's Cinema Roll from the Hello Kitty series, and Sanrio makes its way to his brand new

862
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,920
DS game that's coming out July 19th.

863
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,360
It's an action game featuring Cinema Roll.

864
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:57,280
I must admit, out of all the Sanrio characters, Cinema Roll is the most comfortable to lay

865
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
on.

866
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,200
I had a Batsumaru pillow once.

867
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
I love Batsumaru.

868
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
It's my favorite.

869
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,760
This is my friend in Texas.

870
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,360
And since we just talked about an anime convention, of course we have to mention that there is

871
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,200
yet another Naruto game coming out.

872
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:18,800
Saikyo Ninja Daikyu 5 is coming out on the DS July 19th as well.

873
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,560
Another Naruto game, bet you can't wait, all of you.

874
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,400
I can wait and keep waiting, thank you.

875
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,360
Now this is one, you don't have to be a fan of Japanese games to know this game.

876
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:34,800
Bomberman, Touch Bomberman Land Star Bomber No Miracle World coming out from Hudson July

877
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
19th on the DS in Japan.

878
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,560
That's all I'll be mentioning this week for release dates, so let's go to the US.

879
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,280
The US is going to be getting ready for some football because NCAA Football 08 is going

880
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:56,320
to be coming out this week on Playstation 2, Xbox, Playstation 3, and the 360.

881
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,200
And then of course, if you're not a fan of college football, then maybe you want to check

882
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:06,080
out the new All Pro Football 2K8, which is coming out on both Xbox 360 and Playstation

883
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,080
3 this week.

884
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,640
If you're not a fan of football at all, maybe you're a fan of some other sports games, including

885
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,800
Hot Shots Tennis on Playstation 2 and Rugby 08 on Playstation 2, both coming out this

886
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
week.

887
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,840
Or, let's see, on the PSP, Smash Court Tennis 3 is making its way out.

888
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,520
Tales of the World Radiant Mythology on the PSP, and then there's a small little game

889
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:36,440
called Parappa the Rapper on the PSP is finally making its way out, which will be pretty cool.

890
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:49,400
And then of course, on the Wii, you have Absolutely Nothing, and then on the DS, Absolutely Nothing

891
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,400
as well.

892
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,800
I was wrong, in the US, this isn't a slow game week, because you named a lot of big

893
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,320
sports titles there, especially with Madden.

894
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
Well, not Madden.

895
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
No small change.

896
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

897
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
NCAA Football 08.

898
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
Isn't Madden out very soon?

899
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,320
Like this month?

900
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
August.

901
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Oh, it's August.

902
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Yeah.

903
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
Never mind.

904
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
Well, still, a lot of sports titles there.

905
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,600
Your next two Wii titles aren't exactly something to run home about, but Alien Syndrome on the

906
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:19,680
Wii, Escape from Bug Island, which both come out next week, or the week after next, I

907
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,560
guess the 24th, and then Mario Strikers Charge is going to be the week after.

908
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,720
Dude, the old school Alien Syndrome arcade game was badass.

909
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,560
I used to love that game, but I'm sure this Wii version is nothing like it.

910
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,560
It looks okay.

911
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,560
It looks like Smash Brothers.

912
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,800
Or not Smash Brothers, Smash TV.

913
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,440
Can I use the Wii Remote as a flamethrower?

914
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,560
Because I remember Alien Syndrome had a flamethrower.

915
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,560
That might be kind of neat.

916
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,040
I think, well, sort of.

917
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,680
I think what it is, is that you use the nunchucks analog stick to move around, and then you

918
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,480
use the pointer to, or the remote to point where you're aiming.

919
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,820
By the way, speaking of Naruto, bringing up the game during the Japanese release dates

920
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,640
reminded me, did anybody catch the Xbox 360 try to, like at Microsoft's conference, they

921
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,560
tried to make a big deal out of how they had this exclusive Naruto game coming to the 360?

922
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,560
Oh, goody.

923
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,280
When it's been on damn near everything else?

924
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,920
Which was met with a resounding meh.

925
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,920
No, this one hasn't been on every other system, however, it's not the only Naruto game coming

926
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,920
out this year.

927
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,640
In fact, there's another one on the Wii, there's two on the, I think two already, one already

928
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,800
that's come out, one more that's coming out on PlayStation 2.

929
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,280
Another one on the PSP, and I think a few more on the DS.

930
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,520
So yeah, if you don't have the Xbox 360, man, how are you going to play some Naruto games?

931
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,880
That's what I want to know.

932
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,680
The Rob D. in chat says, the Naruto game on 360 is exclusive and it looks damn good.

933
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,680
It does.

934
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,360
And it's not a fighting game, I think.

935
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:49,480
All right, well fair enough, we can give it a chance, we're just teasing a little bit

936
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,920
on the Naruto stuff.

937
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:57,280
All right, let's check out Nintendo's press conference, we'll go over and get some stories

938
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,260
from Nintendo's press conference.

939
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:07,040
We have a date for Super Smash Brothers Brawl, it will be December 3rd, about damn time.

940
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,720
I wish it was tomorrow, but I can wait for Pit, I'm a good girl.

941
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,520
It's worth the wait if it's going to be good, like really good, and it does look like it's

942
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
going to be really good.

943
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,000
I know they've showed a stage, I think this was in the last week or two, they showed a

944
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,840
stage from Animal Crossing, an Animal Crossing inspired stage, and that looked awesome.

945
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,560
But did you hear about if you play it at 8 p.m. on Saturday, because the stages will

946
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,920
change depending on the time of day that you play.

947
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,920
Oh no, I know it's coming.

948
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,200
You play at 8 p.m. on Saturday, you know.

949
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,480
K.K. comes out and sings.

950
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,800
That is great.

951
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,200
He should be a selectable character, but only at 8 o'clock.

952
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,240
Did you see the other thing?

953
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:53,080
These are those types of little details that are going to make Smash Brothers Brawl like

954
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,880
single-handedly the reason to own a Wii, if nothing else.

955
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,560
Well, did you see the other weird character that they announced this week, Dr. Wright

956
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,240
from the SimCity game is actually going to be coming to Smash Brothers as a playable

957
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
character, and you can summon him.

958
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,360
Oh no, he's not playable, he's one of those little assist guys you get.

959
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,520
I thought he was playable.

960
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,440
You know, the impression I got was like, you know how in the last Brawl game you had the

961
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,920
Pokeballs and it was all the Pokemon that would come to help?

962
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,840
Well now it's assist, and various characters will come and help you.

963
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,840
Like the Nintendog will paw at the screen, and Dr. Wright makes the skyscrapers that

964
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,840
go boom.

965
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Oh well, whatever.

966
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,280
But nevertheless, it's kind of neat.

967
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,880
What a random little tidbit, right?

968
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,880
I guess.

969
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,000
Yeah, it's just J-100 Man, he's an assist trophy, okay.

970
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,240
Well I thought that he would have been a weird character.

971
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,040
I was surprised, you know, that was another thing I was surprised, we didn't hear anymore

972
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,800
of like, hey Mega Man's going to be in the game, or hey, you know, Sonic's going to be

973
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,800
in the game.

974
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,200
Although I'm pretty much guaranteeing right now that Sonic's going to be in the game since

975
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,240
they're making a Mario and Sonic game, so obviously they're going to...

976
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,520
That's what a lot of fans think, we'll see.

977
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,800
Well Nintendo also announced at the conference that there is going to be a Wii Mario Kart,

978
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,720
to no one's real big surprise.

979
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,360
I mean we kind of speculated that of course there would be a new Mario Kart game coming

980
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:13,400
to the Wii, but there were some surprises, and one of them was that it will be online.

981
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,800
Thank you Nintendo for hearing our prayers and giving some more...

982
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,800
For that game at least.

983
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,820
Yeah, at least for that game, maybe if, you know, they could have done it for some other

984
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:23,080
stuff too, but that's okay, at least they're starting to move in the right direction.

985
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,120
I mean Mario Kart was one of the first online games on the DS, so I suppose tradition can

986
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
continue.

987
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,200
But then they're also going to be bringing out a Wii Wheel, which will be a peripheral

988
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,800
that you can use with Mario Kart on the Wii, and of course obviously...

989
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,800
Oh Wii!

990
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,080
A little Wii Wheel that you plug your Wii Mode into and you can actually turn it like

991
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,480
it's a regular steering wheel.

992
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
Wii!

993
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,700
And Loki, I know you mentioned on Saturday at the convention, they already have this

994
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,600
type of peripheral out there, and...

995
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:55,880
This has been out since launch, they've got two really shitty ass Ubisoft games called

996
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,600
Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT.

997
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,880
And let me tell you, it comes with a crappy wheel just like this, basically you snap the

998
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,660
controller in, it serves no purpose other than, oh I can't imagine that the remote's

999
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,280
a wheel so I need an actual wheel in front of me to turn it!

1000
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,640
So then you play the game with that, okay granted, okay I'll give them this, it is free,

1001
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,000
but it's a gimmick to sell the game, just like it was a gimmick to sell those two other

1002
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
games.

1003
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,200
And I'm going to tell you this much, I will not play it with the damn wheel, and thank

1004
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,600
God they're going to have multiple control options because I fucking hate games with

1005
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,280
the Wii that require you to have the Wii remote sideways to steer it.

1006
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,960
I like Excite Truck where you have it, you know, flat, and then you steer it that way.

1007
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,960
That's fine.

1008
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,880
Blaze in our chat asked, does Excite Truck come with a wheel?

1009
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,880
It actually does not.

1010
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,880
It does not.

1011
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,240
But some people use the other wheel adapter for it.

1012
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
You can't.

1013
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,840
You can't use the other wheel adapter for it.

1014
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:56,600
It won't work because the actual controller needs to be held parallel to the ground, and

1015
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:02,280
then you steer it that way, whereas the Ubisoft games you have to hold the controller perpendicular

1016
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,640
to the ground, and then turn it that way.

1017
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,880
So it's a completely different axis that you would turn it on.

1018
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,640
Now Act Def says the Ubisoft wheel is crappy, the Wii wheel looks like it's better designed,

1019
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,000
so I mean it is a Nintendo first party product.

1020
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,440
Okay, great, it's a better designed piece of crap to get the Sigma controller in.

1021
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,040
Here's the thing I have a problem with, and we'll get into some more of this stuff with

1022
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,440
our next story.

1023
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,920
I'm having a problem with them releasing stuff, I thought, okay, the whole point of having

1024
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,560
the expansion port in the bottom of the Wii remote is that we would be getting new peripherals

1025
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,760
that will plug into the bottom, other than the nunchuck, okay?

1026
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,160
Which I will go into this next story here with the Zapper.

1027
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,720
Wait, can I say, wait, real quick, before we get to the Zapper, can I say one other

1028
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,340
thing about Mario Kart?

1029
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,980
You couldn't see a whole lot of the actual game itself, but I did notice in the brief

1030
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,240
little bits that they showed of Mario Kart on the Wii, there's only one person in the

1031
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
car.

1032
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Thank God.

1033
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,880
Mario Kart isn't a sequel to Double Dash, so I will give Nintendo another few points

1034
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,880
there.

1035
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,360
Okay, now you can move on.

1036
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,680
The other thing they announced was the Wii Zapper.

1037
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,520
Now I remember looking at this E3 originally last year when they had a prototype, and that

1038
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,320
prototype looked pretty awesome, because it was actually something that the Wii controller

1039
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:19,960
would plug into, and it's a whole new peripheral, how it should be.

1040
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,800
However, this new Wii Zapper that they're going to be releasing is just a stupid holder

1041
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,320
for the remote and the nunchuck, and I'm going to tell you what.

1042
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,900
There were some third-party companies releasing something very similar called the Wii Sharpshooter

1043
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:39,220
or the Wii Blaster or whatever, and I thought, my God, who's going to buy this stupid crap?

1044
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:44,480
It looks like it's completely useless, and they went ahead and made the same useless

1045
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
peripheral.

1046
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,480
Knock it off.

1047
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,480
Seriously.

1048
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,160
I mean, this thing looks like crap.

1049
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,560
The only thing that's going to be a selling point for is it's $19.99, and it will come

1050
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,920
with a pack-in game, so great.

1051
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,560
You get a game for $20 and this piece of crap with it, but seriously, they need just, instead

1052
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:09,720
of releasing something that the remote straps into with the nunchuck, just release a new

1053
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,440
goddamn thing that you plug the whole thing into.

1054
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,880
That way, because apparently there's a trigger on the front, and this whole thing is very

1055
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:22,200
awkward to hold anyways because it kind of looks like the Menacer, but not.

1056
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,160
There's no actual dedicated button to the trigger.

1057
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,800
It's just another button that pushes the B button on the bottom of the remote, which

1058
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,520
I can tell you is not going to work very well.

1059
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,400
They kind of looked at these other companies out there and said, oh, look, they're making

1060
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,880
gimmicky crap and people are buying it.

1061
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,060
Let's make some gimmicky crap.

1062
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,880
We don't want to be left out of that, gravy train.

1063
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:51,560
Don't you think this is one of those things that you should really try?

1064
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:57,000
No, I can tell you right now, I like the other one because the trigger is in the back.

1065
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,740
It was like a shotgun.

1066
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,740
It would be comfortable.

1067
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:05,680
It had a little analog stick above the top there, kind of like the new Gun Con, and that

1068
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,080
would be comfortable to hold.

1069
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,520
This thing looks like crap.

1070
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:13,320
It's just probably because, I don't know about you guys, but right now I know nunchucks are

1071
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,320
hard to come by.

1072
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,120
Why I don't know that they can make them fast enough is beyond me, but obviously making

1073
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,560
any additional peripherals that have actual working parts in there would be too much for

1074
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,560
them.

1075
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
Instead, molding plastic is a lot easier.

1076
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,840
If you want to pay 20 bucks for a piece of molded plastic, go right ahead.

1077
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:36,680
I guarantee you, playing these games without the Zapper will be fucking easier and a lot

1078
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:41,840
better than playing it with the Zapper, and you will be sorry that you bought this product.

1079
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,920
I don't know, Loki.

1080
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,160
I know this isn't in our show world tonight, so I can say that there's YouTubage on the

1081
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,560
internet of the new Silent Hill arcade game because it's being location tested in Europe

1082
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,160
or something right now, so some bootlegs of the game hit the internet, and of course,

1083
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,320
being a Silent Hill fanboy, the game looks fucking hot.

1084
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,040
You get to fight Pyramid Head in it, and he tries to chop your face off.

1085
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,040
It's amazing.

1086
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,040
I want right now.

1087
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,880
If they put that game out on the Wii, and I can use this little Wii Zapper thing to

1088
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,880
play this game, I might have sex with everybody at Nintendo, because that would be phenomenal.

1089
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,960
Because that kind of puts you in the game.

1090
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,720
I can be raped by Pyramid Head.

1091
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,360
It's awkward to play with this.

1092
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,680
The trigger's on the goddamn front of the gun.

1093
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,040
It doesn't make any sense.

1094
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,880
Who the fuck has a gun with a trigger on the goddamn front of it?

1095
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:37,000
Even the Super Scope 6 had the trigger in the back.

1096
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It's crap.

1097
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,480
I mean, there's other third party peripherals out there.

1098
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,880
If you want the B like a gun, I've seen one that the remote plugs into it, and it looks

1099
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
like a pistol.

1100
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,600
It has a pistol grip on it, and you just pull the trigger, and it's like pulling the B button.

1101
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:54,200
Alright, now Black Wolf says you don't use the front trigger at all, and he was at E3.

1102
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,120
Okay, the front trigger in the front.

1103
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,120
Okay.

1104
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,120
Why would you not use the trigger in the front?

1105
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,060
What the hell is there a trigger there for then, if you don't use it for the game?

1106
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:08,400
It's for pushing the goddamn B button.

1107
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,480
I still say bring me Silent Hill, shoot him up to the Wii, I will buy the zapper, I will

1108
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,560
hump the zapper, and I will be raped by Pyramid Head, and it would be good.

1109
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,200
I put out this challenge for you.

1110
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,800
When this shit comes out, and when these two fucking games, Resident Evil, Umbrella Chronicles,

1111
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,360
and Ghost Squad come out, I would like to see a side-by-side challenge with someone

1112
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,000
with the zapper, and without the zapper, and see who gets a better fucking score.

1113
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,640
I bet you anything, money, I will bet fucking $50 that the goddamn person without the zapper

1114
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,880
will wipe the floor with someone with the zapper.

1115
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,880
That's why.

1116
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,040
This thing is a piece of awkward shit, is what it is.

1117
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:51,080
$50, I have $50 on this.

1118
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,360
I will like to see this challenge.

1119
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,040
We will perform this challenge in studio.

1120
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,400
I don't know, Rob, are you up to it?

1121
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:09,640
I'm not taking the bet, I'll just play the game, I don't care.

1122
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:17,040
How about this, since I don't have $50, how about this, we'll make the bet.

1123
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,760
The bet will be a date.

1124
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:28,000
If the gun is indeed better, then I will take your wife out on a date, and take her off

1125
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,200
your hands for a night so you can do nothing but play video games, alright?

1126
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:43,120
But if the gun is better, then you will take me out on a date, deal, deal, that's it, deal.

1127
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:48,520
Then the whole chat has heard it, so if the Wii remote is better, the games are better

1128
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,080
without the zapper peripheral, then I will take Loki's wife out on a date, and she won't

1129
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,560
be able to nag at Loki for a whole night, but if the gun is indeed better, Loki will

1130
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,680
take me out on a date, and you better put out.

1131
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,800
We have this on record.

1132
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,800
I'm telling you, this thing looks like crap.

1133
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,000
There's no way it's going to make it better.

1134
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,380
There's no way at all.

1135
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:16,960
WeDoInChat says, Rob offers himself again, what a skank.

1136
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,440
My significant other might have problems with this, but that's alright.

1137
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,440
BlackWolf says, I really don't want to interject facts into a Loki rant because it's too funny.

1138
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,040
WeDo also says, Loki needs a hug, and Rob needs to stop being so skanky.

1139
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,600
Frisbee says it's a 9.4 on the Loki scale, and SSJ100Matt says Loki's rant level was

1140
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,040
at 9 out of 10.

1141
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,040
That's great.

1142
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,160
Alright, there we go.

1143
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:55,920
The date bet over the zapper is on.

1144
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,600
Fifty dollars for one night with your wife.

1145
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,600
Indecent Nintendo.

1146
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,840
Okay, anyway, let's move on.

1147
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,360
News story, please.

1148
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:12,720
And other releases in regards to Nintendo, for anyone who cares, Super Mario Galaxy will

1149
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,600
be out on November 12th.

1150
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,600
That's pretty awesome.

1151
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,200
That game actually looks even better now that I've seen more screenshots and gameplay of

1152
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,200
it.

1153
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
I'm really looking forward to it.

1154
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,840
Actually, I have to agree.

1155
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,800
You know, I really, really loved Super Mario Water Sports.

1156
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,000
Sorry.

1157
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,240
Please tell me you mean Mario Sunshine.

1158
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,240
Mario Sunshine, yes.

1159
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,240
Thank you.

1160
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,480
But I'm sorry, just the whole...

1161
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:42,240
This actually looks very similar to Mario 64, almost like a sequel to Mario 64.

1162
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,240
That's what I like.

1163
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,240
I've even gone back and watched speedruns of Mario 64, you know, people using all the

1164
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,880
glitches in the game to beat it with 17 stars and all that.

1165
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,740
And I was like, dude, I need another Mario 64.

1166
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:00,800
You know, if they could ROM hack GameCube games like they can the old school 8-bit Nintendo

1167
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:06,200
games, I'm sure there would be a Super Mario Water Sports where they would just redo the

1168
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,280
sprites so he whips it out and uses it as a gun.

1169
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,280
It's freaky.

1170
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,680
That was back on the Game Boy with the Link's adventure.

1171
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:20,720
Anyhow, so I'm looking forward to Mario Galaxy as well, but I don't want to make a complete

1172
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:26,160
opinion until I'm able to play it, but certainly the screenshots and videos look enticing.

1173
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,000
This was Nintendo's big thing, for lack of a better term.

1174
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,900
This was their big thing at the press conference, kind of the thing that nobody...

1175
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,040
You have to admit, nobody called this.

1176
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,600
Nobody knew this was coming.

1177
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,120
Wii Fit was the game.

1178
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,420
It's going to be a game that comes with what's called the Balance Board, and you can think

1179
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:50,400
of it as kind of brain training for your body, which I'm sure the idea came from, is probably

1180
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,080
borrowed from the brain training series.

1181
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:58,960
But using the Balance Board, you can do push-ups, steps aerobics, this goalie defense type thing,

1182
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,040
and dancing, and I guess it's taking the old school 8-bit game dance aerobics into a whole

1183
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,040
new...

1184
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,800
Remember with the Power Pad?

1185
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,520
Take it into a whole new generation.

1186
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:14,180
And this was met with a resounding meh from the gaming community, but there's something

1187
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,160
about this that I think is going to make the Wii catch fire even more, because soccer moms

1188
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,960
are going to continue to want to buy this for their kids, honestly.

1189
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,480
I think it's fucking smart.

1190
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,000
I think it looks cool.

1191
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,960
This is something I actually kind of want to buy, because I need an excuse to work out,

1192
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,960
apparently.

1193
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,080
But here's the other thing, too, that a lot of people aren't looking at.

1194
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,360
This is how they need to do the peripherals.

1195
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,320
This is something new, something innovative.

1196
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:43,320
You can imagine incorporating it into a snowboarding game, or a skateboarding game, or something

1197
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,320
like that.

1198
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,760
It's actually a kind of neat peripheral, if they use it in that sense.

1199
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:54,040
Say the next SSX game that comes out, you can use this with a remote as some added immersion

1200
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,200
into the game.

1201
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,520
This plastic add-on shit is stupid, but this will be cool, though, I think.

1202
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,960
I have to admit, when I first saw the press conference and everything, I was one of those

1203
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,800
people that was kind of like, oh, that's it?

1204
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,840
That was their big thing?

1205
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,900
But the more I thought about it, I was like, you know, that is going to get the media talking

1206
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,920
about the Wii all over again this Christmas, just like last year they talked about, oh,

1207
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,800
Wii Tennis gets you up and moving.

1208
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,640
It's going to get them on CNN all over again.

1209
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,760
I am totally getting Wii Fit, because then I can do yoga and not have to go to class.

1210
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,920
Honestly, it's a really freaking smart move, and I hate to come off sounding like a Nintendo

1211
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,920
fanboy.

1212
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,800
I mean, this is nothing that, you know, obviously I'm still very disappointed there was no real

1213
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:40,720
news about online gaming or whatever, but honestly, in the direction the Wii has always

1214
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:46,160
said they were going to go and that they've been going in, this is a logical next step

1215
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,280
that's going to make this thing be popular all over again this Christmas.

1216
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,160
I think it's going to be a smart move for them.

1217
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,840
It's not coming out this year, though.

1218
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,840
Oh, it's not?

1219
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,840
No.

1220
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,840
Oh, I thought it was this Christmas.

1221
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,840
No, next year.

1222
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,840
Well, damn them.

1223
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,840
Really?

1224
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,840
That long?

1225
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,560
I mean, it looked like the game was pretty well into progress, and they're really going

1226
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,560
to make us wait that long.

1227
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,560
It's not coming out until 2008, yeah.

1228
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:12,760
Now, I will say, though, however, that the announcement of Wii Fit did give us this year's

1229
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,280
Giant Enemy Crab Award.

1230
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,880
Yes, that would be the biggest flub that happened at an E3 press conference, and that would

1231
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,120
be when Reggie stepped on the little scale, because it measures your body fat as well,

1232
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,880
and had the Wii tell him he was overweight in front of thousands of people.

1233
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,340
That's got to feel real good.

1234
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:33,620
So congratulations to Reggie Fils-May, winner of the 2007 Giant Enemy Crab Award, yours

1235
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,200
from Orange Launch Radio with love.

1236
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Some other interesting things, of course, they're showing off, or actually they kind

1237
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:46,980
of went a little bit under the radar, but DK Bongo Blast is coming out in October.

1238
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,440
This is the Bongo racing game that's coming out.

1239
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,680
I guess, I think actually you can use the Bongos if you've got them, otherwise you can

1240
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:01,280
just use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck and stuff, and it's going to be a racing game, which

1241
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,280
looks like crap.

1242
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,000
The other one is a brand new channel called the Check Me Out channel, and it's kind of

1243
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,880
a combination of a Mii community as well as a Hot or Not thing.

1244
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,960
You basically can search for different Miis, like say if you want, I use this example on

1245
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,080
Saturday, if you're looking for a Chuck Norris Mii, you can browse through all the people's

1246
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,720
Chuck Norris Miis and check out the one that you think most looks like Chuck Norris, and

1247
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,580
then you can vote that one high or download it and stuff like that.

1248
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:34,880
So that's kind of neat.

1249
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,440
That's pretty much all the big stuff that they were announcing this year.

1250
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:46,040
A lot of it was just kind of like, yeah, we've heard your cry for online gaming and stuff,

1251
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,800
and we're doing what we want still.

1252
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,320
Bobby Black Wolf had a really funny comment in chat that I think really sums things up

1253
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,320
here.

1254
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,940
It says, Nintendo's press conference summarized by Bobby Black Wolf.

1255
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:59,120
This is how we've printed money in the past.

1256
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,680
Here's a bone we're throwing to hardcore gamers, and here's how we will print money in the

1257
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,680
future.

1258
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,600
It's kind of a true statement in my mind.

1259
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,640
All right, let's do the same thing we did for Microsoft.

1260
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,720
Let's go around what you liked, what you didn't like, rate it.

1261
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,240
You want to start us off, Dr. Sarca?

1262
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,240
For Nintendo?

1263
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
Yes.

1264
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:21,560
I think that Wii Fit's redeemed the whole thing, so it gets a nine.

1265
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,720
So you are really excited about Wii Fit that much?

1266
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,720
Absolutely.

1267
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,720
All right.

1268
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,720
Loki?

1269
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:31,520
I think that they lost some innovation points with the announcement of the Wii Wheel and

1270
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,880
the Wii Zapper, because I was really looking forward to the Wii Zapper as something like

1271
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:43,800
that we saw at E3 2006, and it was a real let down to see.

1272
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:48,240
It's just this hunk of plastic crap that I got to throw Wii Remote and Nunchuck in, and

1273
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:53,780
kind of, for me, just said, okay, look, they're embracing this gimmicky shit that people are

1274
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:57,600
putting out, and I kind of thought they were a little bit better than that.

1275
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,600
It was nice to see that they did announce some street dates for some games coming out.

1276
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:07,600
Good, because there's some definite spaces in between some of these better games.

1277
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,520
And I don't know, the Wii Fit thing's great, because they're looking for that whole health

1278
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,600
fitness angle, but I was really disappointed.

1279
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,480
There's not a lot of talk of online that really seemed to skimp that whole part of, was it

1280
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,560
Super Smash, or, not Super Smash Brothers, but Metroid Prime, I know was not supposed

1281
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,320
to be online, I guess, so.

1282
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,320
Uh-huh.

1283
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,320
All right.

1284
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:36,200
And then I would rate it probably a six, actually.

1285
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,640
This was one of those things, I was watching the live feeds of them, I actually turned

1286
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,160
it off because I got bored.

1287
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:47,240
For me, I am a hardcore gamer, and I think one of the disappointing things about Nintendo's

1288
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,600
press conference is that I can probably count the number of games on one hand that I'm really

1289
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,820
truly excited about that are coming to the Wii.

1290
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:58,000
I mean, I'm not really excited about all that much, but granted the games that I am hyped

1291
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,420
for, I'm really, really hyped for.

1292
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,880
So I'm a little bit torn, because I want to give Nintendo props for sticking to their

1293
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,360
guns and kind of continuing down this path that they promised they were going to do next

1294
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,600
year in regards to the new generation of gaming versus the next generation of gaming.

1295
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:16,220
So I give them props there, but I am still left with disappointment over the lack of

1296
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:23,760
some type of centralized online system, just talks about more details on WiiWare, anything

1297
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,400
that could compete with the behemoth of Xbox Live as far as online goes.

1298
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,400
I don't know.

1299
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:33,000
I still felt like there was a lot to be desired, but then again, that is for the hardcore gamer.

1300
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,040
But they're going to win a million points with soccer moms, and they're going to continue

1301
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,960
to do very well in the next year.

1302
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,840
So I don't know.

1303
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:46,160
I personally give them a six, but looking from it, if I wasn't so selfish, I would probably

1304
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,800
give them more of an eight.

1305
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,800
So that's that.

1306
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,600
Let's look at chat and see what the chat says.

1307
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,300
SSJ100Matt says, I'm giving it a C-D+.

1308
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:59,000
They showed their true colors this year that they are careless about hardcore gamers.

1309
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,020
ActDef says, Rob D., I think Microsoft was worse.

1310
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:05,200
They didn't show anything new.

1311
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,560
And that was to Rob D.'s comments that says, I give Nintendo six out of ten.

1312
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,720
It was worse than the other two.

1313
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,560
They're going in a different direction, but they announced Mario Kart.

1314
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:17,040
Rob D. also says, Nintendo's press conference was extremely disappointing to me because

1315
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,520
I think they're showing me that they might be leaving me behind a little bit.

1316
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,840
Let's see.

1317
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,560
Zappy asked, was that fitness game for Xbox any good?

1318
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,640
If you're talking about your self-fitness, no it wasn't.

1319
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,040
I actually had it.

1320
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,920
Let's see.

1321
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,400
WeDo says, Wii needs a soccer kicking game to win over the soccer moms.

1322
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,960
Well, you know, they have the goalie thing in Wii Fit, so who knows.

1323
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,600
DS191 says, I'll make a bold statement, Nintendo did nothing, I mean nothing, to convince me

1324
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,320
to buy a Wii between now and Christmas.

1325
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:52,080
And BlackWolf asks, do you have a source for Wii Fit not coming out in 2007, Loki, because

1326
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,960
they did not confirm or deny that on the show floor.

1327
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,720
I thought it was not on their list.

1328
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:02,280
It was on their release list, I believe, for 2008, because it was supposed to be, God,

1329
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,280
I don't remember.

1330
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,240
I know it said not this year, though.

1331
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,240
I know that for a fact.

1332
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,240
All right.

1333
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,240
Two more comments, then we'll move on.

1334
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,680
David Tyrant says, I give them an 8 out of 10, they showed why they're in a great position

1335
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,080
right now, they've got solid titles and a great lineup ahead of them with their regular

1336
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,260
titles, Mario, Metroid, et cetera.

1337
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:21,720
And Gerardimo says, just my opinion on Nintendo's online situation, are there really that many

1338
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,400
games worth playing online right now?

1339
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,520
Seriously, Mario Party or Big Brain Academy online, that wouldn't be much fun.

1340
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,520
I don't know, I disagree.

1341
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,600
I think Mario Party would actually be a lot of fun online.

1342
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,960
I don't know, I think multiplayer is the only way to go and sometimes your house just can't

1343
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,900
accommodate all those people.

1344
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,600
But that's my opinion, and that's yours.

1345
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,400
So chat.orangeontradio.com if you ever want to join us in the chat room, and of course

1346
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:48,480
we do tape live on Sunday nights at orangeontradio.com on our Live 365 feed, which did not shut down

1347
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:52,520
on July 15th, contrary to the rumor about the whole internet, but thankfully there was

1348
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:56,600
a little reprieve by Congress, which has given people time more to negotiate the rates.

1349
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,880
Of course, we encourage you to visit savenetradio.org and learn more about the situation impacting

1350
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,840
internet radio that continues to.

1351
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,460
For now, let's move on to some other stories that don't have really to do with press conferences

1352
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,960
per se, but some other things going around around the gaming industry.

1353
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,080
Well, this is actually pretty cool.

1354
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:18,120
We mentioned earlier, but Paper Mario is going to the European Virtual Console, and I think

1355
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,200
that's pretty cool because it was a really cool game.

1356
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,640
I didn't get to play a whole bunch of it, but it was classic Nintendo 64 stuff.

1357
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:30,020
It's kind of hard to think of Nintendo 64 stuff as being classic though, because I remember

1358
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:33,140
when it was new.

1359
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:39,560
It is, though, a thousand points to download.

1360
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,840
Right now, though, on the European Virtual Console, then the total Nintendo 64 games

1361
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:49,480
have now Paper Mario, Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time,

1362
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,080
Lilot Wars, and F-Zero X.

1363
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:59,040
Also coming out on Virtual Console is Air Zonk, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, which

1364
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:05,040
was sort of okay, and it's a 600-point game.

1365
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,720
Would you download Paper Mario when it's released here?

1366
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,720
Sure.

1367
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,720
I've never played it.

1368
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,720
Why not?

1369
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,720
Why not?

1370
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,320
It's something new, and I heard it was a pretty good game.

1371
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,240
This is an interesting follow-up.

1372
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:20,480
It's a news story, but it kind of follows along the same path as something we previously

1373
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,840
reported on.

1374
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,840
This comes from gamepolitics.com.

1375
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:30,520
Apparently, Mario Party 8 has been pulled in the UK, and the reason why the game was

1376
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,960
pulled in the UK?

1377
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,840
The word spastic is used in one scene.

1378
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,920
The word can be seen on the Shy Guy's Perplex Express board.

1379
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,040
If a player lands on one of several certain green spaces, Magikoopa will appear, and before

1380
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:47,240
rearranging the train cars, will say, Magikoopa magic, turn the train spastic, make this ticket

1381
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,240
tragic.

1382
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:53,280
And of course, we remember we talked previously about the brain training-ish game, or it was

1383
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,560
actually Mind Quiz was the real game, that had the controversy behind it, because it

1384
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:03,360
used the word spastic in it, which here in the US, not really a big deal of a word.

1385
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:08,160
It's not a very controversial word, but in the UK carries a lot more meaning and oomph

1386
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,880
about the mentally handicapped.

1387
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,520
That's tragic.

1388
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,100
Interesting that it kind of continues another recall over that word.

1389
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,100
Very interesting.

1390
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:25,720
Well, another thing that's tragic is the fact that the government and government groups

1391
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:31,240
feel that they need to step in to protect kids from M-rated games.

1392
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:37,260
So the National Institute on Media and Family is building an army of undercover agents or

1393
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:44,840
shoppers for their 11th annual video game report card, and they're going to be finding

1394
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:53,320
actual minors to go in and attempt to buy M-rated games to see if the actual retailers

1395
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:58,240
will prevent them from buying it.

1396
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,220
I think it's good that they're trying to enforce that stuff.

1397
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,220
I don't know.

1398
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:08,000
I still think though that parents should be more responsible.

1399
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,960
Stop giving your kids money if you don't want them buying crap.

1400
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,960
Let's move on to another segment we like to do every week here on the program.

1401
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,160
It's called the Website of the Week, and it's brought to you by Dark Sakura.

1402
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,840
She likes to surf the internet up and down and all over every week and find a website

1403
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,240
to share with you all out there on the internet.

1404
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:30,600
Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?

1405
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:40,840
The Website of the Week is one that will definitely make an impact, I think, on the world at large.

1406
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:45,480
It is AwfulPlasticSurgery.com.

1407
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:55,560
It's a site taking very famous people and showing just how bad their plastic surgery

1408
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,560
is.

1409
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,960
I'm really not joking.

1410
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,760
It's AwfulPlasticSurgery.com.

1411
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,280
Is it not for the squeamish because I have a feeling a site like this will make you kind

1412
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,280
of go, ah!

1413
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,280
No, it's not that bad.

1414
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:11,000
It's just pictures you'd find anywhere on the internet.

1415
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,360
Thank you, Dark Sakura, for that lovely Website of the Week.

1416
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:20,920
There's also one that's called GoodPlasticSurgery.com, too, that shows plastic surgery is done right.

1417
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:29,200
An example on here is, I find this one funny, Brooke Hogan's boob implants.

1418
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:40,760
Who was it, Victoria Beckham, her boobs that just look wrong.

1419
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,760
It's funny.

1420
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,480
I think it's hilarious.

1421
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,120
Also something I think that is kind of funny and looks like maybe plastic surgery gone

1422
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:52,520
wrong is this very interesting peripheral that was announced at E3 2007.

1423
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,520
It's the Wii Party Station.

1424
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,520
What?

1425
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,520
Huh?

1426
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,520
What?

1427
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,520
It's the Wii Party Station.

1428
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:02,320
Lego, they make a lot of these types of interesting peripherals.

1429
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,320
Look at this.

1430
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,800
They've made this party station.

1431
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,320
It's a coffee table centerpiece for the Wii games.

1432
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,760
It's basically got four stations that can hold your Wii remote there.

1433
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:17,480
You have little LED counters that can count score, like round scores if you're doing that,

1434
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:22,560
but also there's a storage drawer in it for nunchucks and other accessories, and then

1435
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,000
also there's four freezable cup holders that you can put into this thing and then a little

1436
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,400
center bowl for chips and dip.

1437
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,240
It's a little party station for all your Wii crap.

1438
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,240
That's kind of smart.

1439
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,840
You can have a Wii tennis party, and the price for it, $24.99.

1440
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,360
That's not bad just as a storage unit.

1441
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,720
It's kind of actually not a bad price.

1442
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,720
I look at it and go, WTF.

1443
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,720
If I had a coffee table, it'd be great.

1444
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:52,080
There's a lot of people that are into having the Wii Sports parties, especially for, again,

1445
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:57,280
the casual gamers and the soccer mom parties of the world, and I keep using them, but you

1446
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,280
know what I mean.

1447
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,960
People that aren't really into gaming, I think will probably get a kick out of this for their

1448
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,960
next party.

1449
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,640
Where was this when we used to do the money parties?

1450
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,640
Good question.

1451
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:14,860
Yeah, because actually having, I don't know, say just a bag of chips on the table or using

1452
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,840
a bowl for chips is way too difficult.

1453
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,280
I like having the freezer tray.

1454
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,280
That's a really good idea.

1455
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,360
Sure, go ahead and buy this.

1456
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:28,200
You're just encouraging them to make more crap like this that's going to come out later.

1457
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,620
But it's not that bad, Loki.

1458
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,680
I don't know.

1459
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,680
It's better than those little plastic golf clubs that you put your remote into.

1460
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,680
Is it?

1461
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,680
Really, is it?

1462
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:41,320
If the little golf club held chips and dip in it, would it be better?

1463
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,880
Shut up.

1464
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,200
Everything is better with chips and dip.

1465
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,240
We're going to take a quick break because as GS68 says in the chat room, Loki's hit

1466
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,040
his limit break, so he needs to calm down a little bit.

1467
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,600
He needs to go fag his anger for a little bit, which by the way, somebody left an iTunes

1468
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,360
review that said we needed to fag our anger.

1469
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,640
So thank you very much to the mysterious person who wrote that and snuck it through the iTunes

1470
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,840
review sensors.

1471
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,740
If you ever want to leave us an iTunes review, you really should.

1472
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:13,600
It helps expose our show to a whole new audience and word of mouth is the only way independent

1473
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,040
podcasts can survive.

1474
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:19,640
So go to iTunes or any website like Yahoo Podcasts, Digg, any of those sites and leave

1475
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,640
us a review.

1476
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,640
We appreciate it.

1477
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,680
And GS68 makes a good point here.

1478
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:29,000
Chips equals oily equals oily remote, which equals more remotes being thrown in the TV.

1479
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,520
So keep the paper towels nearby.

1480
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,520
Shut up.

1481
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,520
All right.

1482
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,000
We're going to take a quick break.

1483
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,200
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1484
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:44,600
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1485
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,600
a week.

1486
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:58,600
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
