00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:18,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, July 15th, 2007, an E3 wrap-up.

2
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:24,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Microsoft gets Disney movies, Nintendo wants you to get fit, and Sony gives the PSP a makeover.

3
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:42,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,041
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:43,962
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:47,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:47,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.

9
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:48,627
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Jamie?

10
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:49,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh.

11
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, a little, uh.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm conventioning to this morning.

13
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:57,408
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk a little more about that in just a moment, but let me introduce as well Techmaster Loki.

14
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:57,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

15
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,308
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Techmaster Loki?

16
00:00:59,368 --> 00:00:59,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing fine.

17
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:00,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Swell.

18
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you all conventioned out as well?

19
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:03,749
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's too bad or good?

21
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's good news.

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really go to the convention at all.

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,091
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll talk about the convention in just a little bit.

24
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:13,612
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, unfortunately, no real special guests in the studio tonight.

25
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:17,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Xfer's over there playing WoW, but that means he's probably too busy to actually comment on tonight's programs.

26
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:19,553
[SPEAKER_02]: But other folks might come in and out.

27
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:22,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob sounds different from the podcast.

28
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:50,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, well, it could be the fact that it's a different bit rate when we stream live than it is on the podcast.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a little cleaner.

30
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:55,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Our live stream actually uses MP3 Pro encoding.

31
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:59,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the podcast, our audio archive uses MP3 Pro as well.

32
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:03,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the iPods don't recognize MP3 Pro, which is how most people listen to us.

33
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:08,892
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you listen to the shows on WinApp, it actually sounds a little cleaner if you have the MP3 Pro plug-in installed.

34
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little tip for those of you guys that listen live at home.

35
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:15,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's start off tonight's program talking about how is your gaming week.

36
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:31,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, none of us were able to go to E3 this year, so we didn't get to do that, but we'll be talking a lot about that and giving our opinions on things as, you know, outsiders looking in, as well as really relying on your comments as well to kind of let us know what you thought of this year's E3.

37
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:34,463
[SPEAKER_02]: But what kind of games did you play this week since you weren't at E3?

38
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:35,764
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

39
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:41,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I tried to play some Power, Power, Paradise, got as far as getting everything set up and then left the room.

40
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Which we'll be getting into that later.

41
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:48,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I played a little bit of pinball.

42
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Played some Burning Crusade.

43
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I got as far as setting it up and then realizing I had to patch.

44
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:56,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And then saying, screw this noise and not playing.

45
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:02,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And I finally got my first badge in Pokemans.

46
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:05,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

47
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:08,415
[SPEAKER_04]: While I was on the recumbent bike at the gym.

48
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:15,856
[SPEAKER_04]: The Recumbent Bike for people who are not gym savvy or vocabulary savvy means you sit back on your ass and pedal in front of you.

49
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:19,358
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that bike, Loki?

50
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:20,298
[SPEAKER_02]: You would know this better.

51
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:24,401
[SPEAKER_02]: In that one episode of South Park, Mr. Garrison invented the bike.

52
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,122
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the It, I think.

53
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:28,023
[SPEAKER_01]: The It?

54
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:28,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, remember?

55
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:30,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was a parody of...

56
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,045
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

57
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:59,084
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

58
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:29,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob, get me one.

59
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:29,874
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

60
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:32,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

61
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:32,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have money.

62
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:33,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

63
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting you presents requires money that I don't have.

64
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:38,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

65
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:42,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant to play all the E3 demos that were available on Xbox Live.

66
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:43,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never got around to it.

67
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:46,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I got around to downloading them, just not playing them.

68
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:48,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So that wasn't really helpful.

69
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:50,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I did

70
00:04:52,911 --> 00:05:20,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I played more Saints Row multiplayer because we're still testing out the LAN stuff and it works great now that I actually updated all the systems to have the multiplayer patch on it so now it works awesome and it's pretty fun actually the other thing we tried was the other thing I played more Earth Defense Force 2017 because yes we're still not done with the game and it's getting pretty hard now because now we have to play on Inferno um

71
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So we finished a few things on that.

72
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:25,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm playing more Final Fantasy on the PSP.

73
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:29,113
[SPEAKER_01]: More Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories on PSP.

74
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,513
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have stuff to play this week.

75
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:40,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got a preview copy of Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3.

76
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:41,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be playing that.

77
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:43,136
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be fun.

78
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:46,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And then... A lot of folks liked the last game that came out in that series.

79
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it should be pretty good.

80
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:48,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

81
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:52,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's pretty much it for right now.

82
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:58,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking, hopefully this week, Paper Mario is going to be making its way out on our virtual console because it's everywhere else.

83
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:01,676
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I want to play that now.

84
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:03,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Super Paper Mario is pretty fun.

85
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear it's not really much different than the original Paper Mario.

86
00:06:07,178 --> 00:06:10,860
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you have information to back that up that is definitely coming out here Monday?

87
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you just speculating?

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just guessing.

89
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,300
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

90
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:14,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

91
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:14,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

92
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

93
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:44,140
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found in Blue Dragon, before you enter the room to start fighting monsters, you really have to just read these wall of words that talk about the game and how the battle system works.

94
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't really do it for me.

95
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it when you fight a fight, and then somebody comes in helping explain it to you as you're fighting.

96
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:54,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe I'm just... It might be just because it's the demo.

97
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:55,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping, I'm really hoping.

98
00:06:56,163 --> 00:07:02,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would never want to base my judgment of an entire game off a demo, but it was very hard for me to get into for that reason.

99
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:04,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I wasn't really understanding everything that was going on.

100
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does seem to have a pretty cool combat system.

101
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:14,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somewhat a real-time system, but you can have your attack stronger if you wait longer.

102
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,623
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

103
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:17,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product.

104
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:22,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm such a fan of the Japanese RPGs, especially I'm interested in the products that Mistwalker's putting out.

105
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:26,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at least going to rent the darn game if I don't buy it.

106
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:28,786
[SPEAKER_02]: That and Eternal Sonata and the other stuff that's coming.

107
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:30,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear it's three this long.

108
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:31,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Dragon, really?

109
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

110
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:32,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was only two.

111
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:33,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was three.

112
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:34,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, well.

113
00:07:36,854 --> 00:07:37,394
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that.

114
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:43,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And as well, I downloaded Sonic on Arcade, which was a little silly because I have Sonic on the Wii as well.

115
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,803
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just kind of wanted to try it out to sort of see, okay, what's the differences between the emulating on the Wii and the emulating on the Xbox 360?

116
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:56,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, the Xbox 360 one is actually a little bit better because it's not just a straight-up port.

117
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, playing the Wii one does feel like you've whipped out your Genesis and hooked it up and you're playing the real deal.

118
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,692
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Xbox 360 one, you can kind of not only have that,

119
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:08,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a straight up emulation, but you can do the screen resizing.

120
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:13,183
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do the smoothing graphics, which, although it's an option, I don't think it looks that good.

121
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:14,925
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the online leaderboards.

122
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:17,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, there's a lot of little extra things that are kind of cool.

123
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:27,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And to my mind, it's a better value for $5 on the Xbox 360 than the $8 it is on the Wii, because of the fact that it was a Genesis title.

124
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:33,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say if you didn't buy Sonic on the Wii and you're a fan of the series you should definitely check out Sonic on the 360.

125
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:41,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Axe I checked out as well but the problem is that Golden Axe is one of those things that was much cooler when we were kids.

126
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:55,875
[SPEAKER_02]: For me anyway, the original Golden Axe was much cooler when we were kids, and yes, I know it's got a great ending and everything, and the game was so much fun to play, co-op, but I just don't see the magic there in this day and age playing it on the Xbox 360.

127
00:08:56,235 --> 00:09:03,242
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's very repetitive to me, and I think it's just one of those things that was much cooler, watching the magic and everything when I was younger.

128
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:11,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I was going to say, no, I'm really disappointed they haven't brought to live arcade yet is the Gauntlet Legends series.

129
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:12,943
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been cool.

130
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:14,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried Gauntlet.

131
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:17,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a big fan of the original Gauntlet.

132
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:20,119
[SPEAKER_01]: But Gauntlet Legends, you just go play that at the arcade all the time.

133
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:21,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Gauntlet Legends was pretty rad.

134
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the port on the N64 they made of that, and I had a lot of fun with that.

135
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:26,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was a good party game as well.

136
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:32,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the chat room and looking at comments there, Peeker Uno says, Sonic is actually a lot harder than I remembered it to be.

137
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:35,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of am finding the same thing.

138
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:36,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

139
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:38,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finding this game is a lot harder than I remember it.

140
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:43,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be better at video games when I was a kid than I am now in my old age.

141
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking to see what other comments there are.

142
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:47,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, DarkSakura?

143
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:48,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Gauntlet 64

144
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:13,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you this.

145
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:18,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I think going back and playing a game like Gauntlet is much more fun with four people.

146
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:19,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, that's what I mean.

147
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:23,576
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have everybody there playing all the old school stuff, that's fun.

148
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:27,137
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't have a lot of friends, so I don't get to play the old school.

149
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:29,218
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we didn't play Super Metroid on Thursday.

150
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:29,838
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't.

151
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:30,358
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't.

152
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:32,969
[SPEAKER_04]: So you had to play Super Metroid with me this week.

153
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:33,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

154
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,650
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's funny you mention that because I did play.

155
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:37,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I had jury duty this week.

156
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:37,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Suck.

157
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:38,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor Rob.

158
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:39,352
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

159
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they called me back 13 months after I was there before.

160
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:44,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Long-time listeners of OLR may remember I was on like a two-week case last year.

161
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:48,217
[SPEAKER_02]: But I went back this year and thank God I didn't get called.

162
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:51,258
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had to sit around all day long waiting to see if they'd call me.

163
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:57,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Metroid Zero Mission like all day, which, you know, is the next best thing to Super Metroid.

164
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,782
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Game Boy Advance, or in my case, the DS.

165
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:08,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But all I could play was the one Advance game I had in the slot because I lost the stylus to my DS fat, which my DS Lite was uncharged.

166
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:08,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.

167
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:09,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your finger.

168
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,324
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'd be doing.

169
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Screw it.

170
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:13,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Finger works just as well.

171
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:14,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Metro Zero Mission is pretty awesome.

172
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:15,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to play Puzzle Buster.

173
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:20,427
[SPEAKER_01]: I know originally you're thinking, hey, oh, crap, it's going to get the screen all messed up and stuff.

174
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:20,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, fuck it.

175
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:21,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?

176
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:22,368
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just rub it on your shirt.

177
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:22,828
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.

178
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:39,550
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ100 Matt says wow back to jury duty yeah unfortunately Pauly Shore wasn't there though or you know what those pencils that they make you fill out the forms or pens or whatever the fuck that they have use one of those just fucking turn that shit around or I don't know pen cap or something get creative

179
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:43,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so that's pretty much all the games I really played this week.

180
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:49,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So some new stuff, thanks to the marketplace, and some old stuff, thanks to my lack of a stylist for the DS.

181
00:11:49,970 --> 00:12:10,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I played one more game this week, and it's kind of, we'll get into later on with some other discussion, but I played Motorstorm again, and apparently there's a code out there now that unlocks everything, so I did that, thinking, hey, you know, it's been a while since I played this, I got frustrated with how hard the game was, you know, certain races, your bike, or whatever, the physics were really bugging me.

182
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:12,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like Motorstorm anymore.

183
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:14,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's actually really boring.

184
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:18,407
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, before it was pretty good, but now it's just kind of dumb.

185
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:21,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I seem to recall this is the second week in a row you've changed your mind on a game.

186
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:23,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you gotten finicky in your older age?

187
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:32,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but, you know, I know later on we'll probably be talking... Well, last week we talked about the 88 system or whatever that they were releasing for the PlayStation 3 with Motorstorm bundled in.

188
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:36,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather it be Resistance, I think.

189
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:39,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Just Motorstorm, it's a cool game.

190
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:42,522
[SPEAKER_01]: When the demo was out and stuff, everyone was like, oh, I gotta get the game.

191
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:47,870
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you play it, and it's just the layout's not very good, and the races are kind of, eh, I don't know.

192
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:50,495
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

193
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,173
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

194
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,504
[SPEAKER_02]: The Breakfast is provided by the staff and the shuttles going from hotel to hotel and everything.

195
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:35,467
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of trying to look at, okay, so how does everybody else feel that wasn't there at E3?

196
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:39,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're the ones that are really going to be buying all this stuff that they were selling.

197
00:13:39,871 --> 00:13:49,218
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be kind of weird, but overall, in general, the layout and the way that they did E3 this year, I actually like it more than I did the original E3.

198
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:51,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

199
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:11,387
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

200
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:29,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to his show, Bobby Blackwell's show, and all that stuff.

201
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:38,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's what he said on his show this week, is that apparently he was talking to somebody, and the reason why they had to keep E3 in LA this year was because of contracts.

202
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:48,301
[SPEAKER_02]: They had already signed a contract with the city to have this convention, and it's all basically based on the number of hotel nights they guarantee that the city's going to get from it.

203
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of about, you know, the...

204
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:55,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Kickback on the revenue, thank you, for the city that they're going to get from this.

205
00:14:56,233 --> 00:15:03,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing is, this is why they're going to have E4ALL, is because they moved E3 to Santa Monica, which is still in L.A.

206
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,037
[SPEAKER_02]: County, and made it a smaller event.

207
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:10,200
[SPEAKER_02]: But E4ALL was supposed to pick up consumers now and bring in revenue from that.

208
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were still going to meet their numbers that they originally signed off to.

209
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:15,142
[SPEAKER_02]: But according to Bobby in his show this week,

210
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:22,081
[SPEAKER_02]: E3 is, or E for All, I should say, is not living up to expectations as far as the pre-sales are concerned.

211
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:25,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And not a lot of companies are really interested in going at this point.

212
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:27,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's really the only one that's on board.

213
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:28,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, don't give a shit.

214
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:33,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a strong chance that they may opt to take the fine.

215
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,204
[SPEAKER_02]: and just cancel E4ALL.

216
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:41,852
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very strong chance that E4ALL is just going to get axed in favor of just paying a fine and saying, cut our losses.

217
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:49,862
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would mean E3, if it continues next year, which may not happen, ESA may just back out of the show biz altogether.

218
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:52,866
[SPEAKER_02]: If the ESA backs out of this, then...

219
00:15:53,644 --> 00:16:17,545
[SPEAKER_02]: either the ESA is going to back out or E3 is going to move to another city and of course we've heard rumors that Vegas is a possibility San Francisco San Francisco is freaking expensive I don't care, Sacramento damn cheap yeah that's true, San Francisco is probably just as expensive as LA and worse traffic Sacramento, it's dirt cheap come on you can come out here and burn to death

220
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:18,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

221
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:21,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's like 106 degrees this whole week.

222
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:23,686
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really a minor summer in comparison.

223
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:25,546
[SPEAKER_01]: But Sacramento, then I can go.

224
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:26,587
[SPEAKER_04]: San Jose.

225
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:28,287
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea, San Jose.

226
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go to Vegas.

227
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:31,788
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys afraid of planes?

228
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,609
[SPEAKER_01]: San Jose or Santa Clara would be pretty good, too.

229
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:35,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle Silicon Valley.

230
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:35,910
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

231
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I hope E4ALL didn't get canceled.

232
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:44,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of looking forward to going, but then again, if there's not going to be much support, maybe I shouldn't be so excited.

233
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:44,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

234
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:48,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next few days and what the fallout is.

235
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:52,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Floridine says, what about PAX?

236
00:16:53,244 --> 00:17:00,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Penny Arcade Expo, of course, you know, a lot of folks see PAX as kind of one of those expos that's stepping up to kind of fill in the void left by the old E3.

237
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Bandit in chat.orangealtradio.com says, fuck E3, I can't wait for X0708.

238
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:07,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

239
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:09,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I just wanted to share that little tidbit rumor thing with you guys.

240
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:11,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Other housekeeping tonight.

241
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:11,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

242
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:16,543
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing is that I think that I'm going to adopt Dark Tetsuya's nickname for Kaz Harai.

243
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:18,247
[SPEAKER_04]: and Captain Crayola.

244
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:46,536
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to be putting that on our live journal and MySpace and I guess Facebook communities.

245
00:17:46,576 --> 00:17:55,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically any Orange Lounge Radio community will post the link to the MP3 but because of the fact that we also talk about E3 and that and even though it's a little more

246
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:56,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to phrase it.

247
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:59,413
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a little more lax than even what you're going to hear tonight.

248
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:04,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of kind of the duplicate news there, we're not going to post the same show to the feed.

249
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:05,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's out there.

250
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:08,536
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was kind of our initial reactions to a lot of the E3 news.

251
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:10,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were some funny jokes that came out of it.

252
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:13,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a fan of OLR, definitely check out the bonus show this week.

253
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:15,910
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that's about all I wanted to say for housekeeping.

254
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's kick it off.

255
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:17,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start.

256
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:20,453
[SPEAKER_02]: First press conference at E3 this week was Microsoft.

257
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with some Microsoft news.

258
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:26,396
[SPEAKER_01]: So Microsoft, they had a lot of bombs to drop, of course, and this isn't

259
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:28,027
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

260
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:51,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

261
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:04,926
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not telling you yet, but soon.

262
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:12,489
[SPEAKER_02]: But the answer is $30 more than what it should cost because of the Halo propaganda that will be splattered all over this thing, right?

263
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:12,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?

264
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

265
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,271
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, this only joins, you know, what?

266
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:21,993
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two custom controllers that they have right now with Todd McFarlane art and, you know, collectible figurines.

267
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:25,515
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a wireless headset and...

268
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, their points cards, I believe, their three-month cards are now Halo-themed.

269
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:33,353
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's overload is what it is.

270
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,535
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, people will buy it.

271
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:37,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 3 saturation.

272
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:40,879
[SPEAKER_02]: GS191 in chat says, that's one ugly Xbox 360.

273
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, it was ugly.

274
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I don't think it was that ugly.

275
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:45,823
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that bad.

276
00:19:45,863 --> 00:19:46,644
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the thing, though.

277
00:19:47,004 --> 00:19:55,691
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really looking to buy an Elite or something because of the HDMI, but you don't really want to spend the $479, this might be a cheaper alternative for you.

278
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:58,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Donate the money to OLR.

279
00:19:58,823 --> 00:19:59,803
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make good use out of the money.

280
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:27,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it can send us to Vegas for next year's E3, I don't know.

281
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:42,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's the thing, I would just wait and see, because later on they're going to be dropping the price of the 360 anyways, and I want to bet that maybe they're going to add HDMI to all of the Xbox 360s at some point, because I believe the Elite is only a limited time thing anyways.

282
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:51,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, for the record, I actually have a Halo 2 Xbox 360 or a Halo, I'm sorry, a Halo Xbox minus the 360.

283
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're pretty.

284
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,501
[SPEAKER_04]: They're green and you can see through them.

285
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,561
[SPEAKER_02]: They're green and see through.

286
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:58,322
[SPEAKER_04]: When our first Xbox died, that's what we got.

287
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:01,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to, like, the first Xbox was ugly.

288
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:03,803
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Halo one was kind of cool.

289
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:06,123
[SPEAKER_02]: But this gray one doesn't do it for me, I have to say.

290
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:07,504
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gray, it's green.

291
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:08,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

292
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:09,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Gray-green.

293
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:11,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like the color of

294
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:13,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

295
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:14,566
[SPEAKER_04]: It's translucent.

296
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:16,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like violence.

297
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:16,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

298
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:17,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And violence sells.

299
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying this 360.

300
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need HDMI that badly.

301
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:24,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have an Elite anyway, so I don't care.

302
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:28,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I want my HDMI, I'll just play my PS3.

303
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:34,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, though, speaking of HD, this is kind of cool.

304
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:40,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney is actually going to have their movies available in high definition through the download service.

305
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,535
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Box Live Marketplace

306
00:21:50,649 --> 00:22:02,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was kind of interesting, too, for that exact same reason, is that Disney's been kind of Blu-ray oriented, but now here they go with the Xbox service, where Xbox has kind of been with HD DVD, but I guess it's really apples to oranges.

307
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:03,419
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really compare the two.

308
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I think Disney's both, actually.

309
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,442
[SPEAKER_01]: They do both Blu-ray and HD DVD.

310
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:10,004
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're exclusive to Blu-ray.

311
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:11,725
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few that do both.

312
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:12,266
[SPEAKER_04]: However...

313
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:13,765
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

314
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why it's win-win for them.

315
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:42,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you hear Disney put their movies on Xbox 360, my mind automatically goes to the animated classics.

316
00:22:42,712 --> 00:22:45,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, ooh, I can go download The Little Mermaid on my 360.

317
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:47,634
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not quite like that, right?

318
00:22:47,854 --> 00:22:49,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there are some of the stuff on there.

319
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:54,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure Planet.

320
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:55,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a crap movie anyway.

321
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is just their initial offering.

322
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:00,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Tarzan was okay.

323
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:01,923
[SPEAKER_04]: When they put Tron on there, though, let me know.

324
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:04,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But having Rosie O'Donnell as a gorilla was pretty funny.

325
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:07,368
[SPEAKER_04]: If they did Tron HD, ha!

326
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:14,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck, ooh, maybe they will in time because we know we're getting the games on Xbox Live Marketplace, so maybe, maybe.

327
00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:21,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, but I just want to say it's a lot of Disney subsidiaries as well, like Miramax and Touchtone are putting their movies out, too.

328
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:22,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Clerks, please.

329
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Clerks animated series, please.

330
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:26,243
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow.

331
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:35,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what you will be able to download soon on Xbox Live Arcade are a lot of new Xbox Live Arcade games.

332
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:47,056
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed this little trailer at E3 that showed a whole lot of new Xbox Live Arcade games, including the stuff that you can now download right away, Sonic the Hedgehog and Golden Axe, but here's some new stuff that's coming out.

333
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week is Bomberman Live, they've already announced that.

334
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:56,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Undertow, Hexic 2, which is, am I, is that the, that was the sequel to Hexen, right?

335
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,819
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sequel to Hexic.

336
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:02,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Hexen was the sequel to Heretic.

337
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:04,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, crap, never mind, okay.

338
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:05,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Hexen, you could turn people into chickens.

339
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:06,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

340
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:07,367
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

341
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:12,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I first saw that, I was like, oh, because I thought it was like the sequel to the Doom game, but I'm just stupid.

342
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:18,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then we have War World, Sensible World of Soccer, Every Extent Extra Extreme.

343
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:43,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Gion, Wing Commander Arena, Feeding Frenzy 2, Track and Field, Spyglass Board Games, Space Giraffe, Puzzle Fighter 2, HD Turbo Remix, etc, etc, blah, blah, blah Marathon, Poker Smash, Switch Ball, Tetris Splash, Puzzle Quest Switch Ball is supposed to be just like Marvel Madness, apparently And that doesn't mention the Battlestar Galactica game either, which, per Kotaku, sucks

344
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of sad, if the Battlestar Galactica game sucks, because I was really looking forward to that.

345
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:51,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Wing Commander game sucks too, from what I hear, so stop making space combat arena games.

346
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:52,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Sadness.

347
00:24:54,247 --> 00:25:04,934
[SPEAKER_01]: What they should be making is more space RPGs, like Mass Effect, which is coming in November, and is supposed to be the, you know, I guess the cat's meow, or whatever you would say.

348
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:07,636
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be fucking awesome, is basically it.

349
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:09,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be, you know, it's Bioware.

350
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:10,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

351
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:17,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Also coming in September will be Project Gotham Racing 4, which in itself is also pretty impressive.

352
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:22,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Project Gotham Racing 3 was pretty cool.

353
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:24,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'll get 4, though.

354
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:25,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't control the cars in that.

355
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:26,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I suck at those type of games.

356
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:27,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep crashing into walls.

357
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:29,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to drive.

358
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get all woman when I play those games.

359
00:25:33,822 --> 00:25:34,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't drive.

360
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:36,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Die.

361
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:38,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mass Effect.

362
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at the trailer for Mass Effect.

363
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:42,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got a semi.

364
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,315
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a real hot trailer.

365
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:45,536
[SPEAKER_02]: That game looks awesome.

366
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:55,341
[SPEAKER_01]: When you saw Mass Effect, didn't you... For like a half a second, I thought, you know, Phantasy Star Online could have been this good if they had actually tried.

367
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,502
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like what Phantasy Star Online should have been.

368
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:04,025
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead, Phantasy Star Online gave us... Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

369
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:04,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Na, na.

370
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, please listen to the theme of Phantasy Star Online if you don't get my joke.

371
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:15,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Phantasy Star Universe, whatever the hell it is.

372
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,323
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, Mass Effect looks great.

373
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:26,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like V, or some type of epic miniseries movie that's coming soon to the SyFy Network, but in HD.

374
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:27,687
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be pretty epic, too.

375
00:26:27,707 --> 00:26:30,768
[SPEAKER_01]: This is only the first of the trilogy, I believe, for it.

376
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:34,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be a pretty long story, and hell, just make a movie out of it.

377
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:36,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it looks like a movie already, so.

378
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:41,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard that the conversation style in it's really cool.

379
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:43,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you use the thumbsticks to talk live.

380
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:49,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you basically have to choose an option while the other person's kind of talking or whatever, and then that can have an effect on the conversation.

381
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sounds kind of neat.

382
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:54,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I say they take the Mass Effect engine and give us another space quest.

383
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:59,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess anything is possible.

384
00:26:59,295 --> 00:27:00,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what might happen?

385
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:07,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's actually a good thing that's going to happen for our friends overseas.

386
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:19,248
[SPEAKER_04]: In Europe, the Xbox 360 Elite will be out on the 24th of August, which actually was released, the information was released at E3, of course.

387
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:22,389
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a price listed.

388
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:26,111
[SPEAKER_04]: The speculation is that it will be close to what it cost over here in the U.S.,

389
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:30,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations to Europe, even though you have to wait for things a little later.

390
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:32,768
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you're finally getting your Xbox 360 Elite.

391
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:34,288
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want it.

392
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:35,669
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want it, yeah, if you care.

393
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:40,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can find it, because I know the ones over here are practically sold out everywhere.

394
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Make friends with people who work at video game shops.

395
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess producing that larger hard drive is a real challenge out there.

396
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:50,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Slapping that laptop drive into a little case.

397
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:51,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Wee.

398
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:57,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing you might play on your new Xbox 360 Elite is Seen It.

399
00:27:57,874 --> 00:28:04,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this was a big announcement that Microsoft made at their press conference this year, is that they're going to be putting out a casual game called Seen It.

400
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:06,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you might have heard of Seen It before.

401
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:09,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really popular DVD board game.

402
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:13,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know if they have this outside of the U.S., if they have this in other countries.

403
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's a board game, and you play it with a DVD.

404
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played this before.

405
00:28:17,786 --> 00:28:19,827
[SPEAKER_02]: You watch, like, little...

406
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:21,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, didn't...

407
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:46,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess Uno was another attempt, but what have we really had since Uno?

408
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:50,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pure casual, maybe the solitaire game, I don't know.

409
00:28:51,124 --> 00:28:53,927
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing's really caught on like Uno has.

410
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:54,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe Hold'em.

411
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:55,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll give you that.

412
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you really want to reach the casual gaming audience, make your system a lot cheaper, and then they will come because of the price cuts, because it'll look more attractive, but

413
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,700
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

414
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:15,985
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new controller, by the way, that will come with CNET, and it's a controller so simple that even your grandma can use it.

415
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:20,028
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one giant button and four little buttons to use for the answers.

416
00:29:20,368 --> 00:29:24,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently the game is going to come with four of these controllers, which is kind of interesting.

417
00:29:24,652 --> 00:29:30,816
[SPEAKER_01]: The funny thing, too, is it's ripped off of the controller from the Buzz game series, which looks almost identical to that one.

418
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:33,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Viva Piñata Party Animals

419
00:29:53,198 --> 00:29:54,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's due out in November.

420
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:57,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they announced some other stuff.

421
00:29:57,823 --> 00:30:00,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Some more games will be joining the Games for Windows lineup.

422
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Gears of War and Viva Pinata.

423
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:13,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Gears of War is actually supposed to have some additional content for it as well, which I imagine would be probably downloadable here on the Xbox 360, probably around the same time.

424
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:15,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

425
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:22,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Call of Duty 4, they announced that they're going to be doing an exclusive online beta with Xbox 360.

426
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:29,767
[SPEAKER_01]: No details on what's going to be involved with that since they haven't launched these signups yet.

427
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:34,328
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully we'll know more about that soon since the game does come out in November.

428
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:42,130
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, which kind of joining the whole multiple colored accessories trend here,

429
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Pink and Blue Controllers in October

430
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:08,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you didn't have a chance to go to E3, there are some pretty cool stuff on Xbox Live Marketplace for you.

431
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:16,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Some new demos including Blue Dragon, Ace Combat 6, NCAA Football 08, Stuntman Ignition, The Bigs, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

432
00:31:19,568 --> 00:31:24,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go around and talk about Microsoft's press conference and sort of your guys' reaction to it.

433
00:31:25,172 --> 00:31:27,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll pose this question to chat as well.

434
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:28,514
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll read some of your comments.

435
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you happy with Microsoft's conference?

436
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there more you were looking for?

437
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:38,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you could, like, I don't know, I'll throw this totally arbitrary thing out there.

438
00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:41,723
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could rate the press conference on a scale of 1 to 10, what would you give it?

439
00:31:42,303 --> 00:31:45,365
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to say this right off the bat, and I think this goes for all of us.

440
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:48,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was the anticipated price cut?

441
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:49,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It was indisposed.

442
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:50,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

443
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:50,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

444
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:12,852
[SPEAKER_01]: They hinted that they will be making an announcement closer to the fall.

445
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think we might have more on that later in the show, so we'll see.

446
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:19,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Loki, did you like it?

447
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:20,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you not like the conference?

448
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:21,939
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say?

449
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:26,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that they set an example of what their conferences should be like.

450
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:31,006
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically, they said, here, all the games we're going to show you are going to be coming out this year.

451
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,268
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you fucking do it.

452
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:36,290
[SPEAKER_01]: You say, here's our lineup for this fall.

453
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:39,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Get excited, it's going to be out in a few months.

454
00:32:39,984 --> 00:32:43,545
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to certain other companies that said, here's what's coming out.

455
00:32:45,105 --> 00:32:50,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to mention that most of that's going to be next year, late next year, if not later.

456
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:51,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like that.

457
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:56,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that they really hit the nail on the head with that stuff.

458
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:59,010
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really much more I could want from it.

459
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:06,692
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit disappointing that certain games were announced also coming to their platform, but they're going to have a really solid lineup

460
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:16,614
[SPEAKER_01]: There are really certain other publishers and hardware makers are going to have a hard time catching up if something magical doesn't happen in the fourth quarter.

461
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:21,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say probably give them an 8 or 9.

462
00:33:22,018 --> 00:33:22,338
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

463
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:25,720
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, care to give your two cents on what happened?

464
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:31,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, given that you two covered most of my same thought on it, really...

465
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:57,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'm still in, I actually, I think that they are going to do the, I think actually I agree that it was smart for them not to announce a price drop, that if they put something like that more out public around Christmas, or, you know, right after Thanksgiving, you know, for the Christmas rush, then that will, I think, be more of a reason for consumers to go out and get one then.

466
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:04,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's a need that they... They don't need to really announce a price cut right now anyways because they're going into a really strong fourth quarter.

467
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:09,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like that their system's not number one selling right now in the United States.

468
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:12,410
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really need any extra momentum right now.

469
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:16,954
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to see what the fourth quarter's like and then right at the prime moment, boom!

470
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:19,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just hit the Christmas rush right there.

471
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:21,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what they're going to end up doing.

472
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I guess my thoughts on it... I...

473
00:34:26,448 --> 00:34:26,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

474
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:31,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of would like to know what's going to be the big thing that I should be excited about after Halo 3.

475
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:35,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of hoping there might be a little hint of what's to come in 2008.

476
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess I understand the strategy of putting all the cards on the table.

477
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,431
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

478
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:39,071
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.

479
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:40,351
[SPEAKER_01]: They were talking about Halo Wars.

480
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:42,991
[SPEAKER_01]: They were talking about Lost Odyssey, Mass Effect.

481
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:44,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect is this year.

482
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:46,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but it's after Halo 3.

483
00:34:47,772 --> 00:34:48,033
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

484
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:51,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Grand Theft Auto 4, Beautiful Katamari.

485
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a big lineup that's not just Halo 3.

486
00:34:55,475 --> 00:34:56,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

487
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I figured they'd show that.

488
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:19,896
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all stuff that was previously announced, and the stuff that they, this is the first time we're announcing, Viva Piñata Party, and I was like, I don't fucking care.

489
00:35:20,176 --> 00:35:26,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the CNET thing is a good effort, I suppose, but it's not enough to make you go, wow, you're really gonna win with that.

490
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:32,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, ooh, it's neat, because, you know, I'm in the movie industry, so, you know, oh, that's kinda neat, that'd be kinda fun to play at work.

491
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:35,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't thinking, ooh, I gotta go get me one of those.

492
00:35:35,908 --> 00:35:37,289
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.

493
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I would maybe rate the conference like a

494
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:59,209
[SPEAKER_02]: 6.5, I don't know, it's better than Middle of the Road, but not by much, like, there was nothing that made me go, like, hooray, you know, or, like, maybe give me a gamer fangasm, it was mostly, okay, I figured that was coming, I figured that was coming, I figured that was coming, so, that's just me personally, let's go to chat, let's see what some chat folks thought there.

495
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:01,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of you guys here in chat commenting on it.

496
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:06,387
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Tyrant says, Microsoft's conference should have addressed the rings of death issue much, much more.

497
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:09,849
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what do they need to... Why would they bring attention to that?

498
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would they even need to address that?

499
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,310
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already addressed that.

500
00:36:12,351 --> 00:36:14,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just reading someone else's thoughts.

501
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm answering to that.

502
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:16,593
[SPEAKER_04]: We're expanding.

503
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:18,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I'm expanding on this, okay?

504
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:22,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm tired of people complaining about it, and no, I'm not a fucking Microsoft fanboy.

505
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:22,898
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the thing.

506
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:24,519
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dealing with the problem.

507
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:29,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Your consoles now have a three-year warranty on them from the announcement date.

508
00:36:29,882 --> 00:36:36,107
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to fix any of them for free, and they've already fixed the problem in new consoles being manufactured right now.

509
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:40,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what part of it are they not doing anything about?

510
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,091
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to know.

511
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:49,217
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to even mention that stuff, because, okay, and actually Peter Moore did announce, okay, yeah, we made a mistake, but we're taking care of it.

512
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:50,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, enough said.

513
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:57,263
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, Microsoft Prince Conference was basically the status quo, not that many surprises, B in my mind.

514
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:00,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the status quo would be a C. No, that's all right.

515
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:04,591
[SPEAKER_02]: In the gaming industry, we always inflate scores a little bit, right?

516
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:06,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

517
00:37:07,232 --> 00:37:10,274
[SPEAKER_02]: DDRDollarBill says, I wish achievement points meant something.

518
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:14,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, whatever happened to the whole... You win a no prize.

519
00:37:15,217 --> 00:37:16,438
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happened to the whole thing?

520
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:22,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, remember they had the Old Spice Inflate Your Gamer Score Challenge, and, you know, you could win, like, actual... Like, whatever happened to that?

521
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:23,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it just kind of...

522
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:28,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, they need a little boost there.

523
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:33,856
[SPEAKER_02]: That could have been something that they could have talked about that might have gotten me a little more excited, I don't know.

524
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:37,799
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD says, I gotta agree with Loki on Microsoft's press conference.

525
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:39,820
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good example of how they should do a press conference.

526
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:42,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish they would have announced some worthwhile stuff.

527
00:37:43,323 --> 00:37:45,865
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Dark Knight says, Call of Duty 4 totally won me over.

528
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:52,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And ShadowNextGen disagrees with RobD and says, I thought Microsoft announced a great lineup.

529
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,991
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

530
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

531
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,371
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a wrap-up on Microsoft.

532
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:30,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before we get into some of the other companies, I want to ask real quick, because we didn't really cover it in the Gaming Week, but we did talk about how we were at SAC Anime, and I wanted to ask DarkSakura kind of how the rest of the convention went, and if you met any listeners of the program, or what kind of stuff was there game-wise, or what you did.

533
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:34,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked in with my Dolphy this morning and got attacked by Dolphy people.

534
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:39,476
[SPEAKER_04]: So hi, everybody that I met at the convention who was into Dolphys.

535
00:38:40,308 --> 00:38:42,830
[SPEAKER_04]: and my poor doll got petted quite a bit.

536
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:44,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really it.

537
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:45,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I bought a Dalek.

538
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:48,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Exterminate.

539
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:49,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent most of the time in the dealer's room.

540
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:54,601
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd have to say that I didn't watch any anime.

541
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:58,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really meet anybody except for Warrior Bob.

542
00:38:59,005 --> 00:38:59,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And Andrew was there.

543
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:02,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bought a Dalek.

544
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bought a Heartless.

545
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:05,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Plushie.

546
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:09,324
[SPEAKER_02]: because this is not what conventions are about, buying crap just because you want it.

547
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:15,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought a Starman keychain for Mario and a boo and a coin box and a fire flower.

548
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:20,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a bad-sized convention for this town, considering we just had a big one in the Bay Area.

549
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:24,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually better than the Japan Town Anime Fair, actually.

550
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,591
[SPEAKER_04]: The only good thing about the Japan Town Anime Fair is that they had better cosplay.

551
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:29,752
[SPEAKER_04]: There was good cosplay, don't get me wrong.

552
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:31,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Sack anime is going to grow.

553
00:39:31,946 --> 00:39:32,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be bigger.

554
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:35,287
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna have a real, real big convention.

555
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:36,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was great.

556
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:38,267
[SPEAKER_04]: The staff was fantastic.

557
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I was very ill-prepared for it, given that I've just come off Fanime.

558
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:49,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think that, you know, with... Yeah, I almost cosplayed the Doctor.

559
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:50,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow Next Gen.

560
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:56,350
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had thought about the free donuts and orange juice earlier, so we could have promoted that and maybe got a few more people in there.

561
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,471
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we had a bad time.

562
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:01,111
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my only complaint, is that we had a bad time for the panel.

563
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:02,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys are suckers.

564
00:40:03,255 --> 00:40:04,877
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll fill in that one time slot no one wants.

565
00:40:04,917 --> 00:40:05,537
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good, though.

566
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:28,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year, primetime.

567
00:40:30,247 --> 00:40:31,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, you guys are turning into divas.

568
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,673
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we want to seriously say thanks for having us.

569
00:40:35,913 --> 00:40:42,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I love A1 Comics now, even though they're local, because I got my Dalek for a lot less expensive than eBay had it.

570
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,142
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the same one I saw in their store that I called to tell you about.

571
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:46,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how funny.

572
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,391
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

573
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's move on.

574
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:22,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into Nintendo's conference, let's talk release dates real quick, because we like to cover what's going to be coming out in the gaming world with our release dates.

575
00:41:23,136 --> 00:41:23,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, why don't you start us off?

576
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:30,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for our friends in the UK, we have a few things coming out within this week.

577
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:40,147
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 18th, we have Bomberman Live for Xbox 360, and the 20th, we have The Darkness, Transformers the Game, and Two Worlds for Xbox 360 and PC.

578
00:41:40,908 --> 00:41:41,248
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

579
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:44,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Momotaro Densetsu 16 Train Conductor

580
00:42:04,362 --> 00:42:05,463
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those simulation games.

581
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:06,123
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks cute.

582
00:42:06,763 --> 00:42:13,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out on the PlayStation 2, Shonen Oyoji Tsubasa Yoima Ten Ikare is coming out on July 19, 2007.

583
00:42:15,107 --> 00:42:18,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like a little adventure game, probably based off yet another anime.

584
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:31,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You know this series, Ultraman Fighting Evolution 3 is coming out on the PlayStation 2, also on July 19, although I believe that is simply a price reduction, not just a brand new game.

585
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:32,295
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, it's Ultraman.

586
00:42:32,315 --> 00:42:32,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to mention it.

587
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Cinnamon Ball, Kurukuru Sweets Paradise I had a Batsumaru pillow once

588
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:02,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Batsumaru.

589
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:02,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my favorite.

590
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:04,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave it to my friend in Texas.

591
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:11,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we just talked about an anime convention, of course we have to mention that there is yet another Naruto game coming out.

592
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:18,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Saikyo Ninja Daishu 5 is coming out on the DS July 19th as well.

593
00:43:18,616 --> 00:43:19,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Another Naruto game.

594
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:20,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Bet you can't wait.

595
00:43:20,996 --> 00:43:21,316
[SPEAKER_02]: All of you.

596
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:23,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I can wait and keep waiting.

597
00:43:23,157 --> 00:43:23,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

598
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:27,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is one you don't have to be a fan of Japanese games to know this game.

599
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:37,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomberman, Touch Bomberman Land, Star Bomber, No Miracle World, coming out from Hudson July 19th on the DS in Japan.

600
00:43:37,423 --> 00:43:40,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I will be mentioning this week for release dates.

601
00:43:40,303 --> 00:43:41,064
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go to the U.S.

602
00:43:41,544 --> 00:43:41,924
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

603
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:46,145
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S., you're going to be getting ready for some football because...

604
00:43:46,801 --> 00:43:53,967
[SPEAKER_01]: NCAA Football 08 is going to be coming out this week on PlayStation 2, Xbox, PlayStation 3, and the 360.

605
00:43:56,189 --> 00:44:06,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, if you're not a fan of college football, then maybe you want to check out the new All-Pro Football 2K8, which is coming out on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.

606
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:18,050
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not a fan of football at all, maybe you're a fan of some other sports games, including Hot Shots Tennis on PlayStation 2 and Rugby 08 on PlayStation 2, both coming out this week.

607
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:24,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, let's see, on the PSP, Smash Court Tennis 3 is making its way out.

608
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:28,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Tales of the World Radiant Mythology on the PSP.

609
00:44:28,914 --> 00:44:35,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just a small little game called Parappa the Rapper on the PSP is finally making its way out, which will be pretty cool.

610
00:44:36,326 --> 00:44:41,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, on the Wii, you have absolutely nothing.

611
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:44,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprise.

612
00:44:44,854 --> 00:44:45,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprise.

613
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:49,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the DS, absolutely nothing as well.

614
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was wrong.

615
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:56,646
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US, this isn't a slow game week because you named a lot of big sports titles there, especially with Madden.

616
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,311
[SPEAKER_02]: NCAA Football 08 Escape from Bug Island

617
00:45:16,377 --> 00:45:16,977
[SPEAKER_01]: and Mario Strikers Charge

618
00:45:34,682 --> 00:45:35,784
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

619
00:45:51,468 --> 00:46:04,343
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, speaking of Naruto, bringing up the game during the Japanese release dates reminded me, did anybody catch that Xbox 360 tried to, like, at Microsoft's conference, they tried to make a big deal out of how they had, like, this exclusive Naruto game coming to the 360?

620
00:46:04,564 --> 00:46:05,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, goody.

621
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:07,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on damn near everything else.

622
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:09,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was met with a resounding meh.

623
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:13,556
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this one hasn't been on every other system.

624
00:46:13,696 --> 00:46:16,477
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's not the only Naruto game coming out this year.

625
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,818
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's another one on the Wii.

626
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:28,844
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one already that's come out, one more that's coming out on PlayStation 2, another one on the PSP, and I think a few more on the DS.

627
00:46:30,982 --> 00:46:35,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you don't have the Xbox 360, man, how are you going to play some Naruto games?

628
00:46:35,385 --> 00:46:36,246
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to know.

629
00:46:36,867 --> 00:46:41,410
[SPEAKER_01]: TheRobD in chat says, the Naruto game on 360 is exclusive and it looks damn good.

630
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:41,970
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

631
00:46:42,331 --> 00:46:44,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a fighting game, I think.

632
00:46:44,672 --> 00:46:45,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, fair enough.

633
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:47,214
[SPEAKER_02]: We can give it a chance.

634
00:46:48,535 --> 00:46:50,397
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just teasing a little bit on the Naruto stuff.

635
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:55,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's check out Nintendo's press conference.

636
00:46:55,241 --> 00:46:58,643
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go over and get some stories from Nintendo's press conference.

637
00:46:59,344 --> 00:46:59,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

638
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

639
00:47:01,062 --> 00:47:01,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl

640
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a good girl.

641
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:15,990
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the wait if it's going to be good, like really good.

642
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does look like it's going to be really good.

643
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:21,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they've showed a stage.

644
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:22,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this was in the last week or two.

645
00:47:22,612 --> 00:47:27,434
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed a stage from Animal Crossing, an Animal Crossing-inspired stage.

646
00:47:27,814 --> 00:47:29,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And that looked awesome.

647
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:31,075
[SPEAKER_01]: But did you hear about if you play it at 8 p.m.

648
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:31,935
[SPEAKER_01]: on Saturday?

649
00:47:32,175 --> 00:47:35,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the stages will change depending on the time of day that you play.

650
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:36,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I know it's coming.

651
00:47:36,476 --> 00:47:37,217
[SPEAKER_01]: You play at 8 p.m.

652
00:47:37,317 --> 00:47:38,737
[SPEAKER_01]: on Saturday, you get, you know.

653
00:47:39,178 --> 00:47:40,379
[SPEAKER_02]: KK comes out and sings.

654
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,160
[SPEAKER_04]: That is great.

655
00:47:42,781 --> 00:47:45,142
[SPEAKER_04]: He should be a selectable character, but only at 8 o'clock.

656
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:47,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the other thing?

657
00:47:47,124 --> 00:47:51,167
[SPEAKER_02]: These are those types of little details that are going to make Smash Bros.

658
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:52,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl like...

659
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was playable.

660
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:15,682
[SPEAKER_02]: The impression I got was like, you know how in the last Brawl game you had the Pokeballs, and it was all the Pokemon that would come help?

661
00:48:15,843 --> 00:48:23,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now it's Assist, and various characters will come out and help you, like the Nintendog will paw at the screen, and Dr. Right makes the skyscrapers that go boom!

662
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:25,750
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, it's kind of neat.

663
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:29,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but it's, what a random little tidbit, right?

664
00:48:29,992 --> 00:48:30,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

665
00:48:32,514 --> 00:48:35,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, SSJ100Magichat confirms he's not playable.

666
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:37,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I thought that he would have been a weird character.

667
00:48:38,345 --> 00:48:55,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised, that, you know, that was another thing I was surprised we didn't hear anymore of like, hey, Mega Man's gonna be in the game, or hey, you know, Sonic's gonna be in the game, although I'm pretty much guaranteed right now Sonic's gonna be in the game since, uh, they're making a Mario and Sonic game, so obviously they're gonna, that's what a lot of fans think, we'll see.

668
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:55,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Do something.

669
00:48:56,645 --> 00:49:03,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo also announced at the conference that there is going to be a Wii Mario Kart, to no one's real big surprise.

670
00:49:03,753 --> 00:49:12,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we kind of speculated that of course there would be a new Mario Kart game coming to the Wii, but there were some surprises, and one of them was that it will be online...

671
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:15,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Nintendo, for hearing our prayers.

672
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:16,652
[SPEAKER_02]: For that game, at least.

673
00:49:16,752 --> 00:49:17,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, at least for that game.

674
00:49:18,033 --> 00:49:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if, you know, they could have done it for some other stuff, too.

675
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:20,854
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's okay.

676
00:49:21,394 --> 00:49:23,035
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they're starting to move in the right direction.

677
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:27,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Mario Kart was one of the first online games on the DS, so I suppose tradition can continue.

678
00:49:27,577 --> 00:49:34,259
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they're also going to be bringing out a Wii wheel, which will be a peripheral that you can use with Mario Kart on the Wii.

679
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, obviously... Oh, Wii!

680
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:42,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little Wii wheel that you plug your Wii mode into, and you can actually turn it like it's a regular steering wheel.

681
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:42,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii!

682
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:50,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki, I know you mentioned on Saturday at the convention, they already have this type of peripheral out there, and... This has been out since launch.

683
00:49:50,927 --> 00:49:59,011
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got two really shitty-ass Ubisoft games called Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT.

684
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me tell you, it comes with a crappy wheel just like this.

685
00:50:02,853 --> 00:50:04,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you snap the controller in.

686
00:50:04,914 --> 00:50:11,737
[SPEAKER_01]: It serves no purpose other than, oh, I can't imagine that the remote's a wheel, so I need an actual wheel in front of me to turn it.

687
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you play the game with that.

688
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, granted, okay, I'll give them this.

689
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:22,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It is free, but it's a gimmick to sell the game, just like it was a gimmick to sell those two other games.

690
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:23,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to tell you this much.

691
00:50:24,285 --> 00:50:34,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not play it with the damn wheel, and thank God they're going to have multiple control options, because I fucking hate games with the Wii that require you to have the Wii remote sideways to steer it.

692
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:38,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Excite Truck, where you have it, you know, flat, and then you steer it that way.

693
00:50:38,814 --> 00:50:39,254
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

694
00:50:41,055 --> 00:50:43,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Blaze in our chat asks, does Excite Truck come with a wheel?

695
00:50:43,858 --> 00:50:44,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually does not.

696
00:50:44,759 --> 00:50:45,199
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not.

697
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:47,762
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people use the other wheel adapter for it.

698
00:50:48,182 --> 00:50:48,643
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't.

699
00:50:48,923 --> 00:50:50,705
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't use the other wheel adapter for it.

700
00:50:50,845 --> 00:50:57,792
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't work because the actual controller needs to be held parallel to the ground and then you steer it that way.

701
00:50:57,872 --> 00:51:03,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the Ubisoft games, you have to hold the controller perpendicular to the ground and

702
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,531
[SPEAKER_01]: and then turn it that way.

703
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:06,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a completely different axis that you would turn it on.

704
00:51:06,872 --> 00:51:09,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Actdeft says the Ubisoft wheel is crappy.

705
00:51:09,454 --> 00:51:11,475
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii wheel looks like it's better designed.

706
00:51:11,595 --> 00:51:13,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it is a Nintendo first-party product.

707
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:15,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.

708
00:51:15,477 --> 00:51:18,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a better designed piece of crap to get the Sigma controller in.

709
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:19,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing I have a problem with.

710
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get into some more of this stuff with our next story.

711
00:51:23,482 --> 00:51:25,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a problem with them releasing stuff.

712
00:51:25,603 --> 00:51:34,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, okay, the whole point of having the expansion port in the bottom of the Wii Remote is that we would be getting new peripherals that will plug into the bottom, other than the nunchuck.

713
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:35,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?

714
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I will go into this next story here with the Zapper.

715
00:51:38,452 --> 00:51:41,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, real quick, before we get to the Zapper, can I say one other thing about Mario Kart?

716
00:51:42,294 --> 00:51:49,339
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't see a whole lot of the actual game itself, but I did notice in the brief little bits that they showed of Mario Kart on the Wii...

717
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:51,602
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only one person in the car.

718
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank God this isn't a sequel to Double Dash.

719
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:57,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will give Nintendo another few points there.

720
00:51:57,543 --> 00:51:59,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

721
00:51:59,304 --> 00:51:59,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can move on.

722
00:52:00,324 --> 00:52:03,105
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing they announced was the Wii Zapper.

723
00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:09,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I remember looking at this at E3 originally, you know, last year when they had a prototype.

724
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:17,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And that prototype looked pretty awesome because it was actually something that the Wii controller would plug into, you know, and it's a whole new peripheral.

725
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:19,722
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

726
00:52:46,448 --> 00:52:47,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Knock it off!

727
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:47,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously!

728
00:52:48,329 --> 00:52:50,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this thing looks like crap.

729
00:52:50,129 --> 00:52:55,911
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that's going to be a selling point for is it's $19.99 and it will come with a pack-in game.

730
00:52:56,071 --> 00:53:01,012
[SPEAKER_01]: So, great, you get a game for $20 and this piece of crap with it.

731
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:06,734
[SPEAKER_01]: But, seriously, they need just... Instead of releasing something that the remote, you know...

732
00:53:07,409 --> 00:53:07,930
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

733
00:53:31,331 --> 00:53:36,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, they kind of looked at these other companies out there and said, oh, look, they're making gimmicky crap and people are buying it.

734
00:53:36,774 --> 00:53:37,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make some gimmicky crap.

735
00:53:38,755 --> 00:53:41,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't want to be left out of that gravy train.

736
00:53:45,618 --> 00:53:46,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it's just gravy train.

737
00:53:48,123 --> 00:53:51,205
[SPEAKER_01]: But isn't this, don't you think this is one of those things that you should really try?

738
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:52,025
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

739
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:59,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you right now, okay, if I want, I like the other one because the trigger is in the back, it was like a shotgun, you know, it would be comfortable.

740
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:06,793
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a little analog stick above the top there, kind of like the new GunCon, and that would be comfortable to hold.

741
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:08,274
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing looks like crap.

742
00:54:08,434 --> 00:54:14,017
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just probably because, I don't know about you guys, but right now I know nunchucks are hard to come by.

743
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I don't know that they can make them fast enough is beyond me, but...

744
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:24,604
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously making any additional peripherals that have actual working parts in there would be too much for them.

745
00:54:24,644 --> 00:54:26,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, molding plastic is a lot easier.

746
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:31,012
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to pay $20 for a piece of molded plastic, go right ahead.

747
00:54:31,052 --> 00:54:38,434
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guarantee you, playing these games without the zapper will be fucking easier and a lot better than playing it with the zapper.

748
00:54:38,454 --> 00:54:40,955
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will be sorry that you bought this product.

749
00:54:41,915 --> 00:54:42,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Loki.

750
00:54:42,935 --> 00:54:52,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this isn't in our show role tonight, so I can say that there's YouTubage on the internet of the new Silent Hill arcade game because it's being location tested in Europe or something right now.

751
00:54:52,618 --> 00:54:54,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So some bootlegs of the game hit the internet and...

752
00:54:55,523 --> 00:54:56,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

753
00:55:10,814 --> 00:55:14,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have sex with everybody at Nintendo because that would be phenomenal.

754
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:37,558
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's crap.

755
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's other third-party, you know, peripherals out there.

756
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:45,361
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want the B like a gun, I've seen one that the remote plugs into it, and it looks like a pistol.

757
00:55:45,381 --> 00:55:48,502
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a pistol grip on it, and you just pull the trigger, and it's like pulling the B button.

758
00:55:48,522 --> 00:55:53,304
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now, BlackWolf says you don't use the front trigger at all, and he was at E3.

759
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:57,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the front trigger in the front, okay.

760
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you not use the trigger in the front?

761
00:55:59,626 --> 00:56:03,147
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is there a trigger there for, then, if you don't use it for the game?

762
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,242
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for pushing the goddamn B button.

763
00:56:08,804 --> 00:56:09,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I still say bring me Silent Hill.

764
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:10,646
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like crap.

765
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:11,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring me Silent Hill.

766
00:56:11,947 --> 00:56:12,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot him up to the Wii.

767
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:14,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I will buy the Zapper.

768
00:56:14,348 --> 00:56:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I will hump the Zapper.

769
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:17,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will be raped by Pyramid Head and it will be good.

770
00:56:17,671 --> 00:56:19,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I put out this challenge for you.

771
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:30,942
[SPEAKER_01]: When this shit comes out and when these two fucking games, Resident Evil, Umbrella Chronicles, and Ghost Squad come out, I would like to see a side-by-side challenge with someone with the Zapper and without the Zapper and see who gets a better fucking score.

772
00:56:31,142 --> 00:56:32,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you anything...

773
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:33,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Money!

774
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:40,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I will bet fucking $50 that the goddamn person without the zapper will wipe the floor with someone with the zapper.

775
00:56:40,705 --> 00:56:41,345
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why.

776
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:43,666
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing is a piece of awkward shit, is what it is.

777
00:56:43,686 --> 00:56:43,666
$50!

778
00:56:46,426 --> 00:56:48,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I have $50 on this.

779
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:52,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I will like to see this challenge.

780
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:54,268
[SPEAKER_01]: We will perform this challenge in studio.

781
00:56:54,528 --> 00:56:55,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Rob, you up to it?

782
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:57,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I don't have $50.

783
00:56:57,129 --> 00:56:57,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not...

784
00:57:02,183 --> 00:57:03,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Taking the bet, I'll just play the game.

785
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:03,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

786
00:57:09,585 --> 00:57:10,166
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this?

787
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:14,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I don't have $50, how about this?

788
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:14,887
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make the bet.

789
00:57:17,008 --> 00:57:19,449
[SPEAKER_02]: The bet will be a date.

790
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:30,352
[SPEAKER_02]: If the gun is indeed better, then I will take your wife out on a date and take her off your hands for a night so you can do nothing but play video games.

791
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:59,397
[SPEAKER_02]: but if the gun is better then you will take me out on a date deal that's it deal alright then the whole chat has heard it so if the Wii remote is better and the games are better without the zapper peripheral then I will take Loki's wife out on a date and she won't be able to nag at Loki for a whole night but if the gun is indeed better Loki will take me out on a date and you better put out

792
00:57:59,673 --> 00:58:01,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We have this on record.

793
00:58:03,475 --> 00:58:05,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, this thing looks like crap.

794
00:58:05,636 --> 00:58:07,336
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way it's going to make it better.

795
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:09,517
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way at all.

796
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,600
[SPEAKER_02]: WeDoInChat says, Rob offers himself again.

797
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,300
[SPEAKER_02]: What a skank.

798
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

799
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:19,402
[SPEAKER_02]: My significant other might have problems with this, but that's all right.

800
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:20,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

801
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,312
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf says, I really don't want to interject facts into a Loki rant because it's too funny.

802
00:58:26,332 --> 00:58:29,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Weedo also says, Loki needs a hug and Rob needs to stop being so skanky.

803
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:33,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And Frisbee says it's a 9.4 on the Loki scale.

804
00:58:34,374 --> 00:58:37,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And SSJ100Matt says, Loki's rant level was at 9 out of 10.

805
00:58:37,895 --> 00:58:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

806
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:40,576
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, there we go.

807
00:58:40,676 --> 00:58:44,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So the date bet over the zapper is on.

808
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:51,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Let your wife know she was just completely used as an object in the program.

809
00:58:51,264 --> 00:58:58,068
[SPEAKER_02]: $50 for one night with your wife.

810
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, indecent Nintendo.

811
00:59:02,431 --> 00:59:03,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyway, let's move on.

812
00:59:03,812 --> 00:59:04,492
[SPEAKER_02]: New story, please.

813
00:59:05,093 --> 00:59:14,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in other releases in regards to Nintendo, for anyone who cared, Super Mario Galaxy will be out on November 12th.

814
00:59:14,479 --> 00:59:15,159
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty awesome.

815
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:16,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

816
00:59:29,912 --> 00:59:30,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Sunshine Mario 64 Mario 64

817
00:59:56,078 --> 01:00:03,223
[SPEAKER_02]: If they could ROM hack GameCube games like they can the old school 8-bit Nintendo games, I'm sure there would be a Super Mario Water Sports.

818
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:08,866
[SPEAKER_02]: They would just redo the sprites so he whips it out and uses it as a gun.

819
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:10,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's freaky.

820
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:13,789
[SPEAKER_04]: That was back on the Game Boy with the Link's Adventure.

821
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:25,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I'm looking forward to Mario Galaxy as well, but I don't want to make a complete opinion until I'm able to play it, but certainly the screenshots and videos look enticing.

822
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:30,898
[SPEAKER_02]: This was Nintendo's big thing, for lack of a better term.

823
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,981
[SPEAKER_02]: This was their big thing at the press conference.

824
01:00:34,523 --> 01:00:36,345
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to admit, nobody called this.

825
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:37,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knew this was coming.

826
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:39,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii Fit.

827
01:00:40,183 --> 01:00:40,683
[SPEAKER_02]: was the game.

828
01:00:41,043 --> 01:00:43,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a game that comes with what's called the balance board.

829
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:49,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can think of it as kind of brain training for your body, which I'm sure the idea came from.

830
01:00:49,887 --> 01:00:51,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably borrowed from the brain training series.

831
01:00:51,988 --> 01:00:59,572
[SPEAKER_02]: But using the balance board, you can do push-ups, steps aerobics, this goalie defense type thing, and dancing.

832
01:00:59,632 --> 01:01:05,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it's taking the old school 8-bit game dance aerobics into a whole new... Remember with the power pad?

833
01:01:05,654 --> 01:01:07,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it into a whole new generation.

834
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:12,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was met with a resounding meh from the gaming community.

835
01:01:12,889 --> 01:01:17,312
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's something about this that I think is going to make the Wii catch fire even more.

836
01:01:17,372 --> 01:01:20,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Because soccer moms are going to continue to want to buy this for their kids.

837
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:20,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly.

838
01:01:21,255 --> 01:01:22,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fucking smart.

839
01:01:22,536 --> 01:01:23,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it looks cool.

840
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:25,599
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is something I actually kind of want to buy.

841
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I need an excuse to work out, apparently.

842
01:01:28,661 --> 01:01:31,384
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the other thing, too, that a lot of people aren't looking at.

843
01:01:31,704 --> 01:01:34,206
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this is how they need to do their peripherals.

844
01:01:34,266 --> 01:01:35,427
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something new.

845
01:01:35,807 --> 01:01:36,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Something innovative.

846
01:01:36,968 --> 01:01:37,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?

847
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:37,769
[SPEAKER_01]: This...

848
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:43,630
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine incorporating it into a snowboarding game or a skateboarding game or something like that.

849
01:01:44,011 --> 01:01:47,471
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a kind of neat peripheral if they use it in that sense.

850
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:54,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, say, the next SSX game that comes out, you can use this with a remote as some added immersion into the game.

851
01:01:55,454 --> 01:01:58,714
[SPEAKER_01]: But this plastic add-on shit is stupid.

852
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:00,875
[SPEAKER_01]: But this will be cool, though, I think.

853
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:03,074
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

854
01:02:26,724 --> 01:02:31,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it's a really freaking smart move, and I hate to come off sounding like a Nintendo fanboy.

855
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:49,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is nothing that, you know, obviously I'm still very disappointed there was no real news about, like, online gaming or whatever, but honestly, in the direction the Wii has always said they were going to go, and that they've been going in, this is a logical next step that's going to make these things be popular all over again this Christmas.

856
01:02:50,618 --> 01:02:51,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be a smart move for them.

857
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:53,720
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not coming out this year, though.

858
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:54,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's not?

859
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought it was this Christmas.

860
01:02:56,021 --> 01:02:56,481
[SPEAKER_02]: No, next year.

861
01:02:56,762 --> 01:02:57,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, damn them.

862
01:02:59,463 --> 01:02:59,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

863
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:00,504
[SPEAKER_02]: That long?

864
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:05,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it looked like the game was pretty well into progress, and they're really going to make us wait that long?

865
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:06,628
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not coming out until 2008, yeah.

866
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:14,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I will say, though, however, that the announcement of Wii Fit did give us this year's Giant Enemy Crab Award.

867
01:03:14,793 --> 01:03:16,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that would be the biggest flub ever.

868
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:16,792
[SPEAKER_02]: D.K.

869
01:03:16,812 --> 01:03:17,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Bongo Blast is coming out in October

870
01:03:46,912 --> 01:03:51,414
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the bongo racing game that's coming out.

871
01:03:51,474 --> 01:03:55,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, I think actually you can use the bongos if you've got them.

872
01:03:56,115 --> 01:03:58,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you can just use the Wii Remote and nunchuck and stuff.

873
01:03:59,316 --> 01:04:01,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be a racing game, which looks like crap.

874
01:04:03,237 --> 01:04:06,378
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is a brand new channel called the Check Me Out Channel.

875
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:14,021
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of a combination of a me community as well as a hot or not thing.

876
01:04:14,825 --> 01:04:16,707
[SPEAKER_01]: You basically can search for different me's.

877
01:04:16,827 --> 01:04:19,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I use this example on Saturday.

878
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:27,576
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for a Chuck Norris me, you can browse through all the people's Chuck Norris me's and check out the one that you think most looks like Chuck Norris.

879
01:04:27,636 --> 01:04:30,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can vote that one high or download it and stuff like that.

880
01:04:30,538 --> 01:04:31,238
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of neat.

881
01:04:34,381 --> 01:04:38,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty much, I think, all the big stuff that they were announcing this year.

882
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:38,925
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it...

883
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:47,855
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it was just kind of like, yeah, we've heard your cry for online gaming and stuff, and we're doing what we want still.

884
01:04:49,776 --> 01:04:53,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf had a really funny comment in chat that I think really sums things up here.

885
01:04:53,399 --> 01:04:56,481
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Nintendo's press conference summarized by Bobby Blackwolf.

886
01:04:56,841 --> 01:04:58,683
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we've printed money in the past.

887
01:04:59,043 --> 01:05:03,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a bone we're throwing to hardcore gamers, and here's how we will print money in the future.

888
01:05:05,047 --> 01:05:05,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I...

889
01:05:05,555 --> 01:05:08,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a true statement in my mind.

890
01:05:08,577 --> 01:05:10,539
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's do the same thing we did for Microsoft.

891
01:05:10,579 --> 01:05:13,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around what you liked, what you didn't like, rate it.

892
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:14,582
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start us off, DarkSakura?

893
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:15,783
[SPEAKER_04]: For Nintendo?

894
01:05:16,023 --> 01:05:16,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

895
01:05:17,304 --> 01:05:20,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that Wii Fit's redeemed the whole thing, so it gets a nine.

896
01:05:21,528 --> 01:05:23,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are really excited about Wii Fit that much?

897
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:24,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

898
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:24,590
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

899
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:27,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that they lost some

900
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of thought they were a little bit better than that.

901
01:05:57,571 --> 01:06:01,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice to see that they did announce some street dates for some games coming out.

902
01:06:01,612 --> 01:06:06,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, because, you know, there's some definite spaces in between some of these better games.

903
01:06:07,415 --> 01:06:16,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I don't know, the Wii Fit thing is great, you know, because they're looking for that whole health fitness angle, but I was really disappointed there's not a lot of talk of online.

904
01:06:16,899 --> 01:06:20,360
[SPEAKER_01]: They really seem to skimp that whole part of, was it Super Smash, or

905
01:06:21,047 --> 01:06:22,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Super Smash Bros., but Metroid Prime.

906
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not supposed to be online, I guess, so... I don't know.

907
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:28,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

908
01:06:29,396 --> 01:06:33,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would rate it probably... Probably a 6, actually.

909
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:40,608
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't... This was one of those things, I was watching the live feeds of them, I actually turned it off because I got bored.

910
01:06:40,628 --> 01:06:41,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

911
01:06:42,156 --> 01:06:43,618
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

912
01:07:00,374 --> 01:07:11,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a little bit torn because I want to give Nintendo props for sticking to their guns and kind of continuing down this path that they promised they were going to do next year in regards to the new generation of gaming versus the next generation of gaming.

913
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:18,358
[SPEAKER_02]: So I give them props there, but I am still left with disappointment over the lack of some type of centralized online system.

914
01:07:18,378 --> 01:07:27,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It talks about more details on WiiWare, anything that could compete with the behemoth of Xbox Live as far as online goes.

915
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:27,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

916
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I still felt like there was a lot

917
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:30,880
[SPEAKER_02]: to be desired.

918
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,661
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, you know, that is for the hardcore gamer.

919
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:38,463
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're going to win a million points with Soccer Moms, and, you know, they're going to continue to do very well in the next year.

920
01:07:38,923 --> 01:07:39,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

921
01:07:40,944 --> 01:07:46,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally give them a 6, but looking from it, like, if I wasn't so selfish, I would probably give them more of an 8.

922
01:07:47,766 --> 01:07:48,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's that.

923
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:51,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at chat and see what the chat says.

924
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:53,989
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, I'm giving it a C-D+.

925
01:07:54,269 --> 01:07:57,690
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed their true colors this year that they are careless about hardcore gamers.

926
01:07:58,953 --> 01:08:02,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says, Rob D, I think Microsoft was worse.

927
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:04,318
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't show anything new.

928
01:08:05,078 --> 01:08:08,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was to Rob D's comments that says, I give Nintendo 6 out of 10.

929
01:08:08,641 --> 01:08:09,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It was worse than the other two.

930
01:08:09,662 --> 01:08:12,824
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going in a different direction, but they announced Mario Kart.

931
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:20,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob D also says, Nintendo's press conference was extremely disappointing to me because I think they're showing me that they might be leaving me behind a little bit.

932
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:22,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

933
01:08:23,953 --> 01:08:26,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Zappy asks, was that fitness game for Xbox any good?

934
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,316
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking about your self-fitness, no, it wasn't.

935
01:08:30,936 --> 01:08:36,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Weedoo says Wii needs a soccer kicking game to win over the soccer moms.

936
01:08:36,598 --> 01:08:39,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, they have the goalie thing in Wii Fit, so who knows.

937
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,141
[SPEAKER_02]: GS191 says, I'll make a bold statement.

938
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:47,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo did nothing, I mean nothing, to convince me to buy a Wii between now and Christmas.

939
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:51,910
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf asks, do you have a source for Wii Fit not coming out in 2007, Loki?

940
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they did not confirm or deny that on the show floor.

941
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:55,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was not on their list.

942
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:57,978
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on their release list, I believe, for 2008.

943
01:08:58,018 --> 01:09:02,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was supposed to be... God, I don't remember.

944
01:09:02,883 --> 01:09:05,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it said not this year, though.

945
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:05,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that for a fact.

946
01:09:06,564 --> 01:09:07,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, two more comments then we'll move on.

947
01:09:07,985 --> 01:09:09,565
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Tyrant says, I give them an 8 out of 10.

948
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:12,046
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed why they're in a great position right now.

949
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:16,208
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got solid titles and a great lineup ahead of them with their regular titles, Mario, Metroid, etc.

950
01:09:17,168 --> 01:09:20,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gerardimo says, Just my opinion on Nintendo's online situation.

951
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:23,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there really that many games worth playing online right now?

952
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:25,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, Mario Party or Big Brain Academy online?

953
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:26,812
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't be much fun.

954
01:09:27,573 --> 01:09:27,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

955
01:09:27,953 --> 01:09:28,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I disagree.

956
01:09:28,513 --> 01:09:30,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Mario Party would actually be a lot of fun online.

957
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:31,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

958
01:09:31,994 --> 01:09:35,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I think multiplayer is the only way to go and sometimes your house just can't accommodate all those people.

959
01:09:36,803 --> 01:09:38,324
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's my opinion, and that's yours.

960
01:09:38,524 --> 01:09:41,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So chat.orangeontradio.com if you ever want to join us in the chat room.

961
01:09:42,065 --> 01:09:51,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights at orangeontradio.com on our live 365 feed, which did not shut down on July 15th, contrary to the rumor about the whole Internet.

962
01:09:51,889 --> 01:09:56,470
[SPEAKER_02]: But, thankfully, there was a little reprieve by Congress, which has given people time more to negotiate the rates.

963
01:09:56,791 --> 01:10:03,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we encourage you to visit savenetradio.org and learn more about the situation impacting Internet radio that continues to.

964
01:10:03,792 --> 01:10:32,534
[SPEAKER_04]: for now let's move on to some other stories that don't have really to do with press conferences per se but some other things going around around the gaming industry well this is actually pretty cool we mentioned earlier but Paper Mario is going to the European Virtual Console and I think that's pretty cool because it was a really you know cool game I didn't get to play a whole bunch of it but it was you know classic Nintendo 64 stuff it's kind of hard to think of Nintendo 64 stuff as being classic though because you know I remember when it was new but um

965
01:10:33,098 --> 01:10:36,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, though, 1,000 points to download.

966
01:10:38,342 --> 01:11:00,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, though, on the European Virtual Console, then the total of Nintendo 64 games, they have now Paper Mario, Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Lylat Wars, and F-Zero X. Also coming out on Virtual Console is Airzonk, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, which was sort of okay.

967
01:11:01,297 --> 01:11:01,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a 600-point game.

968
01:11:04,537 --> 01:11:05,577
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

969
01:11:22,773 --> 01:11:23,073
[SPEAKER_02]: GamePolitics.com

970
01:11:48,140 --> 01:12:03,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we remember we talked previously about the brain training-ish game, or it was actually Mind Quiz was the real game, that had the controversy behind it because it used the word spastic in it, which here in the U.S., not really a big deal of a word.

971
01:12:03,287 --> 01:12:05,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a very controversial word, but in the U.K.

972
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:11,251
[SPEAKER_02]: carries a lot more meaning and oomph about the mentally handicapped.

973
01:12:12,632 --> 01:12:13,512
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tragic.

974
01:12:14,022 --> 01:12:18,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting that it kind of continues another recall over that word.

975
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:19,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

976
01:12:20,384 --> 01:12:30,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, another thing that's tragic is the fact that the government and government groups feel that they need to step in to protect kids from M-rated games.

977
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:41,613
[SPEAKER_01]: So the National Institute on Media and Family is building an army of undercover agents or shoppers for their 11th annual video game report card.

978
01:12:42,193 --> 01:12:42,673
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um,

979
01:12:43,334 --> 01:12:54,983
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be finding actual miners to go in and attempt to buy M-rated games to see if the actual retailers will prevent them from buying them.

980
01:12:56,264 --> 01:12:57,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

981
01:12:58,306 --> 01:13:01,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's good that they're trying to enforce that stuff.

982
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:03,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

983
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:06,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think, though, that parents should be more responsible.

984
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:10,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop giving your kids money if you don't want them buying crap.

985
01:13:10,476 --> 01:13:10,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

986
01:13:11,548 --> 01:13:14,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to another segment we like to do every week here on the program.

987
01:13:14,869 --> 01:13:18,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Website of the Week, and it's brought to you by DarkSakura.

988
01:13:18,109 --> 01:13:23,690
[SPEAKER_02]: She likes to surf the Internet up and down and all over every week and find a website to share with you all out there on the Internet.

989
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:27,071
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?

990
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:38,893
[SPEAKER_04]: The Website of the Week is one that will definitely make an impact, I think, on the world at large.

991
01:13:40,811 --> 01:13:53,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It is awfulplasticsurgery.com It's a site taking very famous people and showing just how bad their plastic surgery is.

992
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:57,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really not joking.

993
01:13:57,883 --> 01:14:01,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awfulplasticsurgery.com Is it not for the squeamish?

994
01:14:01,065 --> 01:14:06,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have a feeling a site like this may make you kind of go, No, it's not that bad.

995
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:08,630
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, pictures you can find anywhere on the internet.

996
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:09,291
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

997
01:14:10,745 --> 01:14:14,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you, DarkSakura, for that lovely website of the week.

998
01:14:14,188 --> 01:14:17,750
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also, I think, one that's called goodplasticsurgery.com, too.

999
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:18,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1000
01:14:18,911 --> 01:14:20,813
[SPEAKER_04]: That shows, you know, plastic surgery's done right.

1001
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:27,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, an example on here is, like, I find this one funny, Brooke Hogan's boob implants.

1002
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:32,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And who was it?

1003
01:14:33,242 --> 01:14:38,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Victoria Beckham, her boobs that just look wrong.

1004
01:14:39,927 --> 01:14:40,207
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1005
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:42,350
[SPEAKER_04]: it's funny, I think it's hilarious

1006
01:14:43,582 --> 01:14:51,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also something I think that is kind of funny and looks like maybe plastic surgery gone wrong is this very interesting peripheral that was announced at E3 2007.

1007
01:14:52,445 --> 01:14:53,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Wii Party Station.

1008
01:14:54,005 --> 01:14:54,845
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1009
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:55,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1010
01:14:56,006 --> 01:14:56,226
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1011
01:14:56,946 --> 01:14:57,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Wii Party Station.

1012
01:14:58,266 --> 01:15:02,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Nyko is, you know, they make a lot of these types of interesting peripherals.

1013
01:15:02,147 --> 01:15:02,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at this.

1014
01:15:02,868 --> 01:15:04,688
[SPEAKER_02]: They've made this party station.

1015
01:15:04,728 --> 01:15:08,189
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a coffee table centerpiece for the Wii games.

1016
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:11,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically got four stations that can hold your Wii remote there.

1017
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:12,510
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1018
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:33,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little party station for all your Wii crap.

1019
01:15:33,172 --> 01:15:34,373
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of smart.

1020
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:35,994
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a Wii tennis party, yeah.

1021
01:15:36,514 --> 01:15:38,555
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the price for it?

1022
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:38,555
$24.99.

1023
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:41,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not bad just as a storage unit.

1024
01:15:41,556 --> 01:15:43,797
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, it's kind of actually not a bad price.

1025
01:15:43,817 --> 01:15:44,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at it and go, WTF?

1026
01:15:44,758 --> 01:15:47,239
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had a coffee table, it'd be great.

1027
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:55,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot of people that are into having the Wii sports parties, and, you know, especially for, again, the casual gamers and the soccer mom parties of the world.

1028
01:15:55,442 --> 01:15:57,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I keep using them, but you know what I mean.

1029
01:15:57,783 --> 01:15:58,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, people that aren't really...

1030
01:15:59,204 --> 01:15:59,905
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1031
01:16:19,058 --> 01:16:21,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I like having the freezer tray.

1032
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:21,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good idea.

1033
01:16:22,121 --> 01:16:23,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, go ahead and buy this.

1034
01:16:23,261 --> 01:16:25,763
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just encouraging them to make more crap like this.

1035
01:16:26,264 --> 01:16:27,504
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to come out later.

1036
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,586
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not that bad, Loki.

1037
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:30,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1038
01:16:30,607 --> 01:16:34,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than those little plastic golf clubs that you put your remote into.

1039
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:34,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?

1040
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:36,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, is it?

1041
01:16:36,951 --> 01:16:40,854
[SPEAKER_01]: If the little golf club held chips and dip in it, would it be better?

1042
01:16:41,154 --> 01:16:41,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1043
01:16:42,615 --> 01:16:44,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is better with chips and dip.

1044
01:16:45,818 --> 01:16:46,078
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1045
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:52,005
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a quick break because as GS68 says in the chatroom, Loki's hit his limit break.

1046
01:16:52,485 --> 01:16:53,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So he needs to calm down a little bit.

1047
01:16:54,007 --> 01:16:58,011
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs to go fag his anger, which by the way, somebody left an iTunes review.

1048
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:00,865
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1049
01:17:21,002 --> 01:17:49,800
[SPEAKER_02]: MGS68 makes a good point here chips equal oily equals oily remote which equals more remotes being thrown into TVs so keep the paper towels nearby shut up alright we're going to take a quick break we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
