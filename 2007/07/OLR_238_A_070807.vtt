WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.040
The PlayStation 3 might be getting a price cut in the name of E3, notable games may not

00:21.040 --> 00:26.280
even show up in E3, and lots of tunes are dying over a new advertisement in World of

00:26.280 --> 00:33.280
Warcraft.

00:56.280 --> 01:22.080
So, let's

01:22.080 --> 01:23.400
have a contest on the program.

01:23.400 --> 01:36.520
In

01:36.520 --> 01:40.800
the next on

01:40.800 --> 01:41.800
Actually, who knows?

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
How's your week been?

01:42.800 --> 01:43.800
It's been good.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.160
Now, you saw Transformers last week and told us all about it.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.760
You seen anything new this week?

01:47.760 --> 01:48.760
No.

01:48.760 --> 01:53.320
Actually, I meant to see Transformers again this week, but I got lazy.

01:53.320 --> 01:58.040
We got out of work early on the 3rd, and I was like, you know, I could go see Transformers

01:58.040 --> 01:59.040
again.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.780
But then I got out to my car and it was hot, and I was like, I just want to go home and

02:01.780 --> 02:02.780
sit in the air conditioning.

02:02.780 --> 02:07.880
It's been very hot here in Sacramento, where our show is based, like 106 or 107.

02:07.880 --> 02:08.880
This week's been crazy.

02:08.880 --> 02:09.880
At least we don't have humidity.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.640
Anyway, you'd think we were a movie podcast or something, but we're actually not.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.760
We talk about video games, so we're going to start off tonight's program as we always

02:16.760 --> 02:18.400
do, talking about how was your gaming week.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.800
But first, I want to introduce our chat room.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.980
It's over at chat.orangelawnsradio.com.

02:23.980 --> 02:28.660
We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, and interesting things always happen if you're

02:28.660 --> 02:32.600
listening live, such as if you listen tonight, we had to do two takes of our intro because

02:32.600 --> 02:33.600
I made a big boo-boo.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.560
So, if you want to hear the whole show, you've got to listen live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock

02:37.560 --> 02:42.920
Pacific Standard Time at orangelawnsradio.com on our live 365 feed, and you can always participate

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
in our chat room.

02:43.920 --> 02:44.920
Chat.orangelawnsradio.com.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.720
We'll also be opening up our Skype line later on.

02:46.720 --> 02:51.760
That's also a telephone number, an 877 number you can call into, and we'll get those calls

02:51.760 --> 02:52.760
a little later on in the program.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.440
But first, Dark Soccer's going to tell us all about her gaming week.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.800
I had one.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.720
I did try to play Super Mario World of Warcraft, and then I got tired of updating all that

03:02.720 --> 03:03.720
crap.

03:03.720 --> 03:09.640
So, what I did was play a little bit of Pokemans.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.640
How's Pokemans been going?

03:10.640 --> 03:14.160
We had an email, actually, last week asking how you were doing on your Pokemans, and you

03:14.160 --> 03:15.160
weren't here.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.160
I'm hardly doing.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
That's what I answered.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.160
I played a crap ton of pinball.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.160
We got two new machines.

03:19.160 --> 03:24.960
We finally got rid of Retardo Johnny Mnemonic, and we got rid of Guns N' Roses.

03:24.960 --> 03:32.560
We have a Simpsons pinball party now, which is really freaking cool, and we have World

03:32.560 --> 03:36.760
Cup Soccer, which was my favorite machine ever.

03:36.760 --> 03:42.240
Of course, my first time playing it, I cracked a billion points, which just goes to show

03:42.240 --> 03:46.280
that my mad skills at that game have only diminished very slightly, because I could

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
at least...

03:47.280 --> 03:49.240
Because you didn't break two billion.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.480
I've almost gotten there.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.520
I was really, really good at that machine.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.920
I also played the Spiderman pinball today.

03:55.920 --> 03:59.960
The new one does really, really good, and I kept hitting Sandman over and over and over

03:59.960 --> 04:00.960
again.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.040
Thank God for being a bad, bad guy in the movie.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.040
The end.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.120
Low-key, how was your gaming week?

04:07.120 --> 04:09.120
And less dramatic, please.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.120
It was good.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.120
We finally hooked up.

04:11.120 --> 04:17.840
Well, we have a temporary setup for the 360 LAN systems at my work now, so we tried a

04:17.840 --> 04:21.480
few test games of Saints Row, and it's fun.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.480
I can't wait.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.280
The only problem is, right now we have...

04:25.280 --> 04:29.500
Some of the systems have the patch for the multiplayer in it so that there's no lag,

04:29.500 --> 04:33.840
and some of them don't, so we ran into a few issues with that.

04:33.840 --> 04:40.400
But one thing that's awesome in the game is the pimp slap power-up that you can get.

04:40.400 --> 04:45.040
Basically, you run around with a pimp hat on, you can backhand people and fling them

04:45.040 --> 04:48.920
across the entire stage, which is awesome.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.220
The only problem is the game only has three multiplayer maps, which kind of sucks, and

04:53.220 --> 05:00.840
I've been kind of spoiled with Infinite Sprint and Grand Theft Auto, so it'll hold this over

05:00.840 --> 05:03.480
until Grand Theft Auto IV.

05:03.480 --> 05:07.220
Been playing lots of Final Fantasy on the PSP.

05:07.220 --> 05:11.720
I don't know why, but I've been playing it, and it's pretty good.

05:11.720 --> 05:18.040
Just finished, was actually getting the TNT to the dwarves so they can blow up that one

05:18.040 --> 05:23.080
part of the map to allow you to sail the ship outside a little sea that's in the middle

05:23.080 --> 05:24.680
there.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.680
So that's kind of neat.

05:25.680 --> 05:33.640
And then, other than that, I played Transformers the game, and I think last week I said that

05:33.640 --> 05:36.680
it was an alright game, obviously there's some flaws in it and stuff.

05:36.680 --> 05:42.320
I want to rescind that and say that the game blows ass and it's awful.

05:42.320 --> 05:47.900
The more you play it, the more you realize the game is really, really awful.

05:47.900 --> 05:52.000
I got so frustrated with the game, it's so bad.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.640
I was fighting Starscream and Blackout, and first you have to fight Starscream, and then

05:58.640 --> 06:02.000
you eventually have to fight Blackout, then you have to fight them both together.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.520
Well, the little drones that they throw down in the middle were actually harder than Starscream

06:07.520 --> 06:10.680
and Blackout, which is stupid.

06:10.680 --> 06:17.360
But the whole game is very glitchy, and I highly recommend not playing it.

06:17.360 --> 06:23.180
I will play it through to get some more achievement points, but I'm going to quickly sell this.

06:23.180 --> 06:25.320
But you did give this game a favorable review last week, right?

06:25.320 --> 06:26.320
It was okay.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.040
You know, some of the missions are alright.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.400
I haven't played too many of the Decepticon missions, I'm still playing through the Autobots

06:31.400 --> 06:35.120
because I want to play the worst part of the game first and then play stuff where you have

06:35.120 --> 06:36.840
to blow up things.

06:36.840 --> 06:43.800
But I actually watched my friend play the first mission of the Decepticons, and it didn't

06:43.800 --> 06:46.360
look that much more fun, actually.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.800
It looked like it sucked, so I don't know.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.360
It's just a really bad game, I guess, unfortunately.

06:53.360 --> 06:56.960
Tigerclaw, a big, big Transformers nerd, has some advice for you.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.000
Loki, Loki, to beat the drones, you have to throw things at them first.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.680
I understand that, and that's what I was doing because obviously each drone has the same

07:04.680 --> 07:09.880
damn pattern to them, and I was throwing stuff and it wasn't doing anything.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.480
So it was dumb.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.440
Now, this happens sometimes.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.680
We do change our opinions on video games, and not something that's really talked about

07:16.680 --> 07:17.680
a whole lot.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.320
You know, sometimes this happens with movies.

07:19.320 --> 07:23.000
You may watch a movie one time and you didn't like it, but then the second time you watch

07:23.000 --> 07:24.320
it you see something you didn't see before.

07:24.320 --> 07:25.840
Sometimes that happens with games, too.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.760
Can you think of other games that you've ever changed your mind on after playing them, either

07:29.760 --> 07:35.920
favorably or unfavorably?

07:35.920 --> 07:38.300
I can't think of anything offhand.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.440
Maybe Guitar Hero was cool in the beginning and it kind of sucks now.

07:42.440 --> 07:48.640
And then again, music games for me right now, I just can't dedicate enough time to them.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.640
So I don't know.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.520
I would say World of Warcraft, I didn't get into it the first time I played it.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.760
Maybe Final Fantasy XI, you know?

07:55.760 --> 07:57.320
Yeah, maybe.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.680
Because after a while, you know, it started just...

07:59.680 --> 08:01.080
After two years for me.

08:01.080 --> 08:05.720
Finally you get done with the low-level partying stuff and then you realize, oh yeah, this

08:05.720 --> 08:07.720
kind of sucks now.

08:07.720 --> 08:13.760
But I don't know, it's okay.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.920
Activision is pulling an Ubisoft is what they're doing.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.200
They're really letting me down with a lot of their games.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.880
Or we talked about this last week briefly, Nintendogs.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.600
Like I think it was the last week or two weeks ago we talked about how we all loved Nintendogs

08:24.600 --> 08:27.880
when we first played it and then we actually played the full game and was like, wow, this

08:27.880 --> 08:28.880
got old quick.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.020
And really I can't blame Activision, I guess, too much for these games because they're not

08:32.020 --> 08:36.760
developing them, but stop publishing crappy games.

08:36.760 --> 08:43.880
I mean seriously, I was discussing something with you guys off-air earlier and it's like,

08:43.880 --> 08:46.720
stop publishing crappy games, you know?

08:46.720 --> 08:47.720
Dumb ideas.

08:47.720 --> 08:51.000
What else was I going to say?

08:51.000 --> 08:55.040
I was just thinking that you don't really see that a lot in the review game industry

08:55.040 --> 08:57.600
where people kind of change their minds over time.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
I don't know.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.480
Not really addressed a lot, but it can happen.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.000
Anyway, anything else for your gaming week?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.960
No, that's pretty much it.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.520
My gaming week wasn't anything too spectacular because I was still playing some World of

09:09.520 --> 09:10.520
Warcraft.

09:10.520 --> 09:15.720
I've been working on the Battlestar Galactica themed PvP guild because we aren't just nerds

09:15.720 --> 09:18.920
playing World of Warcraft, we have to take it one step further and incorporate Battlestar

09:18.920 --> 09:22.360
Galactica into our guild, so that's like double nerd.

09:22.360 --> 09:26.080
So I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft, but also the new game I checked out this week,

09:26.080 --> 09:30.480
I did check out Missile Command on Xbox Live Arcade because I do love the old, old 2600

09:30.480 --> 09:34.000
version and the old arcade version to some extent as well.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.560
And the Atari ports are coming out pretty good.

09:37.560 --> 09:42.200
They're cheap, they're five bucks, and the enhanced graphics are actually really good.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.520
It doesn't feel like the same type of graphics.

09:45.520 --> 09:49.200
They actually, when they enhanced the graphics, they enhanced it for widescreen mode as well,

09:49.200 --> 09:51.200
so it kind of changes the element of Missile Command.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.160
The only thing I don't really like is that I want to be able to control the game with

09:54.160 --> 09:55.160
a mouse.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.600
I don't like using the stick to control the game.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.320
Missile Command was the type of game that was meant for a freaking trackball or a mouse,

10:02.320 --> 10:04.880
which is essentially an inverted trackball, right?

10:04.880 --> 10:06.680
That's why I cannot play that game with a thumbstick.

10:06.680 --> 10:10.480
I need some type of mouse or trackball control to really play Missile Command.

10:10.480 --> 10:15.920
But as far as the presentation, graphics, sound, gameplay, it's Missile Command.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
And it's cheap.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.920
So it's fine.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.120
I remember another game that I had with favorable reviews and then they kind of went down towards

10:22.120 --> 10:23.120
the end.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.120
What's that?

10:24.120 --> 10:25.120
Elibits was another one.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.120
Yeah, me too.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.120
Me too.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.040
I really liked Elibits and then I was kind of like, eh, I got old.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.360
It's always, it gets old, just not like that.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.360
That, uh, Rayman's Raving Rabbids, I think a little bit.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.520
That's more of a party game though.

10:36.520 --> 10:41.400
I'm trying to think of a game that I hated at first that I grew to like a lot more.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.280
Oh, I know.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.280
Silent Hill.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.160
I didn't like Silent Hill the first time I played it.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
And now I love it.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.720
It's like totally just one of those things where I saw, I don't know, I saw something

10:49.720 --> 10:51.360
I didn't see before the first time.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.880
Driver 3 made peer pressure.

10:52.880 --> 10:53.880
I don't know.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.880
I hate the game.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.880
I still hate the game, but it's fun to play.

10:56.880 --> 10:57.880
Uh, Jamie.

10:57.880 --> 10:58.880
Burnout.

10:58.880 --> 10:59.880
Oh, Burnout.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.440
I was kind of stupid at first.

11:01.440 --> 11:06.520
And then when I saw how big explosions could be, I was like, I like, I like explosions

11:06.520 --> 11:11.640
and wrecks and I really like them in my video games, especially when that's the whole point.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.760
I had just the opposite.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.680
I liked it when it first came out.

11:14.680 --> 11:19.240
Um, well actually I think the one that really stood out for me is Burnout Takedown and then

11:19.240 --> 11:22.240
Revenge is just kind of eh, it's okay.

11:22.240 --> 11:26.080
And then, you know, the newer ones are just kind of eh, I don't care.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.120
Uh, of course our chat room wants to chime in with their suggestions.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.640
JV Mon says, Katamari gets old really fast.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.640
Like within minutes.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.640
Yeah, the PSP one.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.640
That's like a perfect example.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.880
Uh, let's see, um, SSJ 100 Matt is commenting on Missile Command.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.360
Who needs a port when you got the real thing?

11:41.360 --> 11:43.200
I finally fixed my Atari 400.

11:43.200 --> 11:47.800
Well, for the enhanced mode, you know, for the enhanced mode is totally, you know, high

11:47.800 --> 11:50.920
def graphics and Rayvar music and you know, all that kind of stuff.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.380
And it's only five bucks, which if you think about how many quarters you popped into Missile

11:54.380 --> 11:57.360
Command back in the day, five bucks is not too bad of a deal.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.960
Um, but you know, it just depends.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.320
I mean, some people aren't into the old retro classics.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.320
I am, so it's worth it to me.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.480
But if you're not into the retro upgrades, well then there's probably a lot on Xbox Live

12:06.480 --> 12:07.480
you don't like.

12:07.480 --> 12:11.620
Uh, but I also wanted to say I played Luminous a lot this week because of the new packs that

12:11.620 --> 12:12.620
came out last week.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.560
I finally got around to downloading those.

12:14.560 --> 12:18.880
And now it's kind of cool because Luminous has all these different skins in it now.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.680
I mean, granted, I've probably dropped like 30 bucks on the game when you count how much

12:22.680 --> 12:25.200
I paid for the game and all these other packs I'm buying.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.000
But the Tokyo Club pack is decent.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.280
I think there's like two okay songs and two pretty good songs.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.280
And the skins are all good.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.680
And the booster pack has some pretty good stuff.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.680
I haven't unlocked everything.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.560
I think I've unlocked 13 of the 20 skins.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.200
Um, there's some pretty decent stuff in there.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.680
Uh, a couple recycles from the old Luminous games, which isn't much of a surprise, but

12:40.680 --> 12:41.680
some new stuff as well.

12:41.680 --> 12:42.680
So.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.680
I did play a dance game this week.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.680
I forgot.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.680
No, what's that?

12:45.680 --> 12:50.720
Uh, briefly played Neon FM, which, uh, went on the PC or something.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.720
Yeah, I got leaked in there.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.480
But, uh, well, it never got made, let me put it that way.

12:55.480 --> 12:56.480
It's okay.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.200
It would have been pretty cool if they had the dance pads for it and stuff.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.200
It's just, you know.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.200
Uh, I guess, well, god, you want to keep interrupting my gaming week?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.200
I can't think.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.200
I'm done.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.200
Yeah, I think I am too.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.200
Luminous was really it.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.720
Luminous and Missile Command and World of Warcraft and that's really it.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.880
Not a whole lot else.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.360
Outside the norm that I've been talking about the last few weeks on the show in regards

13:14.360 --> 13:15.360
to DS.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.360
Oh, come on.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.360
No game tab?

13:17.360 --> 13:20.600
Uh, maybe a little bit, but I'm not allowed to discuss it because I get called a whore

13:20.600 --> 13:22.000
and a sellout when I do.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
That's okay.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Be a whore and a sellout.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
It's up to you.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Well, then I did play a little bit of game tab this week as well, yes.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.760
And when did you play on game tab?

13:27.760 --> 13:29.160
Uh, old Atari 2600 games.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.160
That's been my thing.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.520
I've been going back through leaderboards trying to get high scores on stuff.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.520
I played BurgerTime too.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.520
Rob likes to score.

13:34.520 --> 13:35.520
Trying to remind.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.520
Oh, sorry.

13:36.520 --> 13:41.440
I was going to say, remind me, I need to let you, uh, loan you, um, Sam and Max season

13:41.440 --> 13:42.440
one.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.440
Well, you don't need to.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.440
I have it on game tab.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.440
I just haven't played it.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.440
Then play it.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.440
I know.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.440
I need to.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.440
All right.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.440
Anyway, so that's that.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.560
Let's, uh, go to some housekeeping and then we'll get into gaming news.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.560
Housekeeping tonight.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.480
SAC anime, we mentioned last week, we'll be going to SAC anime.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.080
Uh, we only hit a little, we hit a little kink though.

13:59.080 --> 14:03.320
We don't know if we're actually doing a panel at SAC anime cause, uh, communication has

14:03.320 --> 14:04.920
not been so great, but that's okay.

14:04.920 --> 14:05.920
Things happen.

14:05.920 --> 14:06.920
It was very last minute.

14:06.920 --> 14:11.080
Uh, I know at least dark Sakura is going to SAC anime, uh, and I'm going as well, so we'll

14:11.080 --> 14:12.080
be around.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.080
So if you're going to be there, say hi, Loki.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.280
I don't know if you're going or not.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.280
When is it?

14:15.280 --> 14:19.840
It's next weekend at the double tree, maybe quadruple tree.

14:19.840 --> 14:23.920
So we'll, you know, Hey, I got an idea.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.920
Let's name it tree.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.560
No, double tree.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.560
Okay.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.560
I was holding up for quadruple tree.

14:29.560 --> 14:30.560
Anyhow.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.960
Uh, that's really it.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.480
We just want to mention that we'll be appearing there in one way or another, even if we're

14:34.480 --> 14:36.560
just walking the floor like the rest of you.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.960
And uh, again, uh, we're always looking for automate conventions in California and the

14:39.960 --> 14:44.000
West coast area that we can get to, to, uh, come say hi, cause we love doing live panels

14:44.000 --> 14:47.040
and that's like, you know, we, we like doing our show live.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.920
I don't know if you noticed, but we've recorded live.

14:48.920 --> 14:52.040
You guys have the chat room and it's a whole nother thing to have the studio audience.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.880
Don't you love when everybody's staring right at you?

14:53.880 --> 14:55.920
Dark Sakura, isn't that the best way to record a show?

14:55.920 --> 14:59.480
I'm used to it all the time.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.240
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.120
Who wants to start us off tonight?

15:03.120 --> 15:04.120
I guess I could.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.120
All right.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.120
If I got to.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.120
All right.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.120
Yes, you got to.

15:08.120 --> 15:13.880
Well, there is a, uh, expected a price cut coming for the PlayStation three, uh, supposed

15:13.880 --> 15:15.720
to reduce by a hundred dollars.

15:15.720 --> 15:23.040
Um, there was an ad put out by a circuit city saying that, um, it was going to be, uh, dropping,

15:23.040 --> 15:28.880
um, right now it's 600 bucks, but I don't know, 500 might make it actually sell better.

15:28.880 --> 15:33.520
I don't know, but, um, it's supposed to be in conjunction with E3.

15:33.520 --> 15:39.560
So that's going to be this year's E3 speech, 499 us dollars, 499 us dollars.

15:39.560 --> 15:44.200
And the rest of us are like, okay, well, I mean the other models dropping the three 99

15:44.200 --> 15:46.000
other model, they're not producing it anymore.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.360
Oh, I got those bastards item.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.120
I didn't even think of that because when I heard about the a hundred dollar price drop,

15:54.120 --> 15:55.880
I was like, oh, well then the other one will be three 99.

15:55.880 --> 15:56.880
That'll be easily affordable.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.880
I forgot.

15:57.880 --> 15:58.880
They got rid of that.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.920
Sneaky bastards.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.020
I was all excited about this price drop too.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.280
And I guess everyone's doing it now.

16:03.280 --> 16:07.460
In fact, I think a few people at, I remember seeing some scans of target receipts where

16:07.460 --> 16:09.520
people are buying them for four 99 already.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.440
So it's everywhere, but it's a secret.

16:12.440 --> 16:16.520
You're not supposed to know about this yet.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.040
God, I have to admit though.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.880
I'm still not, I'm still not sold 500 still a lot.

16:22.880 --> 16:26.120
You're talking to a guy who's like moving in a few weeks and has all those expenses.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.480
So I can't be thinking about video game expenses right now.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.480
I mean, we're gonna play Jamie's just, I don't know people just, that's okay.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.000
It's collecting dust at my house anyway.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And everyone's like, oh, well that makes it more affordable.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.760
I'm going to buy that instead of a three 60.

16:37.760 --> 16:41.960
Well, don't you think they're going to re drop the price of a three 62 to compete with

16:41.960 --> 16:42.960
this?

16:42.960 --> 16:43.960
Obviously.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.280
Otherwise actually they might leave it the same because you know, they feel it's competitive

16:47.280 --> 16:49.600
pricing still and stuff like that.

16:49.600 --> 16:54.360
But I would, I'd hope that they dropped the price of three 60.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.680
Lots and lots of feedback in chat room on this raw steel UT says price drop after less

16:57.680 --> 16:58.680
than a year.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.680
That's a problem.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.680
SSJ 100.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.640
Matt says they can drop the price as much as they want, but people will still bitch.

17:03.640 --> 17:08.200
People bitch when the Wii was $50 more and raw steel UT responds to that true.

17:08.200 --> 17:14.560
If people had their way, they'd be free and separate off 12, 15 degrees.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.720
We paid that $50 on the Wii for the crappy Wii sports.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.720
But I don't know.

17:18.720 --> 17:23.280
See as hardcore gamers, we look at Wii sports and we go, eh, you know, the, the novelty

17:23.280 --> 17:28.600
wears off after a little bit, but seriously, I know people that are not gamers that still

17:28.600 --> 17:30.240
all they talk about Wii tennis.

17:30.240 --> 17:33.480
Like I was having dinner with some friends the other night who are not like the gamer

17:33.480 --> 17:35.640
crowd and they were like, let's have a Wii party.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.880
Let's get together and play Wii tennis.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.100
Rob, you have a Wii, don't you?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.500
Let's all get together and play.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.880
And so like it's, it's still like a lot of fun for a lot of people.

17:42.880 --> 17:47.880
Just maybe not the hardcore audience who kind of, you know, got over it after a few months.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.320
It was kind of interesting watching the effect that has.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.920
There you go.

17:51.920 --> 17:58.400
JVMon suggests $499 PlayStation 3 is better competition for the Elite 360.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.640
Gerardimo says if PlayStation 3 dropped the price, I might buy one even though there are

18:01.640 --> 18:02.720
still no games.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.420
Hold out.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.660
Hold out is all I can say.

18:06.660 --> 18:07.660
Think about it.

18:07.660 --> 18:11.360
We're going to sucker you into buying it before the holiday season and guess what's going

18:11.360 --> 18:13.000
to fucking come out later on?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.080
Oh, look at that.

18:14.080 --> 18:18.360
It's the six axis controller with rumble now and now we're including them with the new

18:18.360 --> 18:19.360
systems.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.360
Oops.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.360
You already bought one.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.760
Now you have to buy another controller too.

18:22.760 --> 18:23.880
Just fucking wait.

18:23.880 --> 18:28.400
There's no games really that are super huge coming out between now and Christmas anyways.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.760
I mean, wait until the fall.

18:30.760 --> 18:35.000
You can wait a few more months and just pick up the good games when they come out then.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
So I have a question for you guys.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.040
I already said I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner at this time and this doesn't really change

18:39.040 --> 18:42.800
my opinion, but my question for you guys is you guys have bought PlayStation 3s.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.040
Loki, you bought the old $499 model, which was the 20 gig.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.920
Jamie, you guys bought the deluxe one.

18:47.920 --> 18:51.200
Do you guys feel shafted by this?

18:51.200 --> 18:53.320
No.

18:53.320 --> 18:56.160
You don't feel like you got ripped off even though they're dropping the price because

18:56.160 --> 18:59.920
maybe you've had nine months of good game play before that?

18:59.920 --> 19:00.920
Right.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.640
I got my PlayStation 3 first day, so I don't care.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.640
I wouldn't call it.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.640
I got my good out of it.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.360
I don't really even care about it.

19:07.360 --> 19:12.120
I got $100 off of it anyway because we used our Discover card and got money back.

19:12.120 --> 19:17.200
I wouldn't call it good game play, but no, seriously, that's one of my reasons why I'm

19:17.200 --> 19:19.720
telling people that they should hold off.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.560
I have my PlayStation 3.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.160
I bought maybe five games for it.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.480
I sold back most of those because guess what?

19:28.480 --> 19:31.720
They were just the 360 counterparts and they weren't any better.

19:31.720 --> 19:40.320
I mean, Ridge Racer 7 and Full Auto 2, Motorstorm, it was pretty cool for a little bit and then

19:40.320 --> 19:44.640
it got boring really quick and then Resistance, that's probably the only one I'd say that's

19:44.640 --> 19:50.240
really good on it, but still, that's four games that I bought on that system since it's

19:50.240 --> 19:51.240
come out.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.720
How many games have I bought on the 360?

19:52.720 --> 19:53.720
Way too many.

19:53.720 --> 20:00.540
So Lair, Heavenly Sword, Little Big Planet, Hall, but you know Lair's been delayed to

20:00.540 --> 20:04.760
August now and who knows, I mean, it keeps getting delayed each month, so who knows if

20:04.760 --> 20:06.760
it's not going to end up in September anyways.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.200
Heavenly Sword looks awesome.

20:08.200 --> 20:12.740
I am planning on picking that one up and also, strangely enough, Ratchet and Clank, Tools

20:12.740 --> 20:16.920
of Destruction, which you know, normally a game that I would not be interested in, but

20:16.920 --> 20:20.400
it looks pretty cool, but that's the problem though.

20:20.400 --> 20:24.980
It's only like a couple games, whereas the 360, I'm planning on buying a lot more than

20:24.980 --> 20:26.800
just a couple games.

20:26.800 --> 20:31.640
So that's a problem, because even if they do get you to buy the system, you're going

20:31.640 --> 20:35.000
to be waiting a while for some good games, especially if you're holding out for your

20:35.000 --> 20:38.620
Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid IV.

20:38.620 --> 20:44.600
Plan on waiting about a good another, I don't know, almost nine months now until those games

20:44.600 --> 20:47.400
come out, so if not longer.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.920
Alright, well, with this price cut on the PlayStation 3, I mean, there's a lot of possible

20:51.920 --> 20:56.180
factors for why this price cut is happening now, but could one of them be the pressure

20:56.180 --> 20:57.560
from the third-party companies?

20:57.560 --> 21:02.940
It also came out this week, just before the news of the price cut, that Sega made an interesting

21:02.940 --> 21:05.940
comment about the pricing of the PlayStation 3.

21:05.940 --> 21:12.640
One of the executives at Sega, Masano Madea, actually had this quote, quote, name brand,

21:12.640 --> 21:14.680
price and software are what count.

21:14.680 --> 21:19.080
This is what he told Reuters in an interview, quote, since it's getting difficult to make

21:19.080 --> 21:25.600
software availability a differentiating factor, superior marketing and pricing strategy will

21:25.600 --> 21:27.840
be the key for Sony.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.400
So kind of interesting, he's talking about, you know, maybe Sony should change up their

21:31.400 --> 21:33.760
strategy and look at the way that they're pricing the system.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.280
And lo and behold, they did.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.480
And I do think that they're changing their strategy, I mean, look at the home that's

21:38.480 --> 21:44.360
coming out, it's, you know, a sign of good things to be coming, but I want to see them

21:44.360 --> 21:47.680
here because, you know, promises aren't getting us anywhere.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.060
Obviously, they promise all this shit, you know, that's supposed to be out at launch,

21:51.060 --> 21:55.060
never came out at launch, all these delays, all these third-party games getting delayed

21:55.060 --> 21:58.560
for the PlayStation 3 or just not coming out at all.

21:58.560 --> 22:02.640
And then, you know, at the same time, they need to have a strong Christmas or else they're

22:02.640 --> 22:03.640
doomed.

22:03.640 --> 22:09.220
I mean, because already, you know, the 360s had, you know, a couple strong Christmases

22:09.220 --> 22:11.880
already, and this is going to be the third strong one.

22:11.880 --> 22:15.480
They've got a really good lineup, especially with Halo 3, Grand Theft Auto 4, and God knows

22:15.480 --> 22:18.800
what other stuff is coming out around that time.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.180
And then the Wii, obviously, the Wii is going to take off like crazy at Christmas because

22:22.180 --> 22:25.060
you still can't find them.

22:25.060 --> 22:29.820
They really need to, because they're losing, you know, they're dropping behind a lot now,

22:29.820 --> 22:34.920
and if they don't, you know, pick it up, it's going to be hard.

22:34.920 --> 22:41.600
Now Matt, though, we are sitting just days away from E3 2007, and Sony pulled a pretty

22:41.600 --> 22:45.540
big trump card out of their hand at Game Developers Conference and really changed a lot of people's

22:45.540 --> 22:47.800
minds with Home and LittleBigPlanet.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.920
Are they sitting on something else right now?

22:49.920 --> 22:51.040
I hope they are.

22:51.040 --> 22:55.040
And I really do, because I would like to see them be successful.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.680
A box of Crayolas.

22:56.680 --> 22:57.680
Sorry.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.480
I don't have much faith in Sony.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.040
Crash Bandicoot Paint.

23:04.040 --> 23:09.600
There's that new Spyro game, I was watching the ads for it.

23:09.600 --> 23:16.840
I'm sorry, if all they have to release, you know, is Spyro as far as their games go, then...

23:16.840 --> 23:21.480
MacMan makes an interesting quote, E3 will change everything, and it's very interesting.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.200
Yeah, it'll suck.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
Because we're not there.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.200
Exactly.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.400
The interesting thing about E3 this year is that didn't the developers bitch that E3 was

23:28.400 --> 23:33.600
too big of a deal, and you know, that it was ruining their game, and Sony wah wah wah'd

23:33.600 --> 23:38.680
about E3 last year, and that's kind of the reason E3 has changed a lot, but isn't all

23:38.680 --> 23:41.180
that same pressure still there this year?

23:41.180 --> 23:42.960
Has anything changed?

23:42.960 --> 23:46.380
People are still going to be making a lot of judgments based off of the cards that people

23:46.380 --> 23:48.160
lay on the table at E3.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.600
Whether they're there or not, we're all on the internet now.

23:50.600 --> 23:54.160
I mean, hell, did you hear what Scott over at All Games is doing?

23:54.160 --> 23:57.760
They're like going in there with like a live camera that's going to sit on Scott's head

23:57.760 --> 24:00.520
so you can be at E3 with them.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.520
It's just fucking nuts.

24:01.520 --> 24:06.760
I mean, if they think the pressure is gone from E3 because they made this, you know,

24:06.760 --> 24:09.880
they locked it down like Fort Knox, you're mistaken.

24:09.880 --> 24:10.880
It's...

24:10.880 --> 24:11.880
I understand why they...

24:11.880 --> 24:12.880
Critics are watching you.

24:12.880 --> 24:18.840
I understand why they did this, but they really, you know, E3 needs to succeed this year because

24:18.840 --> 24:22.320
this is kind of a whole new experiment for them to see, you know, kind of changing things

24:22.320 --> 24:25.920
up and supposedly they're going to get more business done, but really, when you think

24:25.920 --> 24:29.000
about it, what kind of business can you get done at E3?

24:29.000 --> 24:32.480
I mean, other than, you know, a lot of the press stuff where they're covering all these

24:32.480 --> 24:38.520
games and everything, I mean, is there really, I mean, granted us, I mean, we were only like

24:38.520 --> 24:43.000
three people at E3, maybe, you know, four or five or whatever, but, you know, obviously,

24:43.000 --> 24:44.360
we can't see all of E3.

24:44.360 --> 24:49.200
It's impossible to cover everything in great detail, but, you know, these larger, you know,

24:49.200 --> 24:51.960
press outlets and stuff, it's a lot easier for them, but really, do you think there's

24:51.960 --> 24:54.720
stuff that they're just missing from E3?

24:54.720 --> 24:55.720
I mean, I don't...

24:55.720 --> 24:59.720
A lot of them just say what the game companies want them to say because they just copy, paste,

24:59.720 --> 25:00.720
press releases anyway.

25:00.720 --> 25:01.720
Okay.

25:01.720 --> 25:05.200
So we're going to expect them to do any more, you know, better work at these places?

25:05.200 --> 25:06.200
No.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.680
There's still enough of the independent press getting in.

25:09.680 --> 25:14.040
Not as much as there should be, and, you know, I'm not saying that bitterly, I promise, but

25:14.040 --> 25:15.040
there is...

25:15.040 --> 25:16.040
Oh, I am.

25:16.040 --> 25:20.720
There is enough of the independent press getting in that are not going to be corporate whores.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.000
Oh, I'm extremely bitter.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.280
I found out when someone from our work's going, bastard.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.280
He's feeling it out.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.280
Oh my God.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.280
All right.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.920
Anyhow, I had to say this in chat because now everybody's making plays on the E3 will

25:34.920 --> 25:38.240
change everything because now they're coming up with their own tag lines.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.160
Kyle Snyder says, dust cap two.

25:41.160 --> 25:44.000
This time it's not dust cap one.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.840
Long running orange lingerie joke there.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.880
JV Mon says, Emodium AD will change everything.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.480
I have no idea what that's even supposed to mean, so forget it.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.480
I'm just excited.

25:53.480 --> 26:00.240
I can't wait to see the press releases and all that stuff and also watching the conferences.

26:00.240 --> 26:07.360
Anyways, another rumor that's supposedly coming out of the Sony press conference, or speculation

26:07.360 --> 26:13.000
at least, is that the six axis controller is getting rumble as well as touch sensitivity.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.080
It'll be interesting to see if they do that.

26:16.080 --> 26:22.480
They didn't really say what exactly it's going to be doing, but apparently that through,

26:22.480 --> 26:29.040
I guess, different sections of the controller, you'll be able to have touch sensitivity very

26:29.040 --> 26:36.760
similar to, I guess like the DS touch screen, and then the rumble as well.

26:36.760 --> 26:42.840
There's been even some confirmation on that coming because apparently in a developer's

26:42.840 --> 26:48.600
behind the scenes video for Haze, they were showing the guy playing the game a little

26:48.600 --> 26:53.960
bit and then all of a sudden one of the shots, oh the controller's blurred out for some reason.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.760
That's kind of weird that it's blurred out.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.440
Why would they do that?

26:59.440 --> 27:02.520
I'm telling you, Sony's got more cards they're going to show at E3.

27:02.520 --> 27:06.480
Oh yeah, Eye of Judgment.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.320
Fuck the Eye of Judgment.

27:08.320 --> 27:12.660
I'm telling you, PlayStation Eye is just a fucking eye toy again.

27:12.660 --> 27:14.480
Don't be suckered into it.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.320
I'm not suckered into it.

27:17.320 --> 27:22.320
Well, we're all going to end up being suckers if we've got a PlayStation 3 down the line

27:22.320 --> 27:31.540
because it looks like Sony is going to be working with the Nielsen's research folks

27:31.540 --> 27:35.540
to see what we're playing, to see what they can advertise in.

27:35.540 --> 27:37.340
Isn't that special?

27:37.340 --> 27:40.880
So yeah, we're going to get more ads in our games thanks to this crap.

27:40.880 --> 27:44.840
Hooray, and we're still going to pay $60 for them.

27:44.840 --> 27:47.520
That's bullshit.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.160
Big stinkin' piles of horse hockey.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.680
Especially when they have tons of ads in games like Transformers.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.120
Come on.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.120
Does that mean...

27:56.120 --> 27:59.000
Well, the whole movie was an Xbox ad, at least at the end.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.720
Because on TV, where the Nielsen Rays are, if I want a show to get canceled, I don't

28:03.720 --> 28:04.720
watch it.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.560
So how do I get a game to get canceled?

28:06.560 --> 28:07.560
Just not buy it?

28:07.560 --> 28:08.560
Don't play it.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.560
How do they rate it?

28:09.560 --> 28:10.560
I don't...

28:10.560 --> 28:11.560
How exactly are they going to monitor it?

28:11.560 --> 28:13.880
I think it's to see who's playing what the most so that they know what type of games

28:13.880 --> 28:15.120
to advertise in.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.120
Interesting.

28:16.120 --> 28:20.040
Now, doesn't Microsoft kind of already do that?

28:20.040 --> 28:22.320
I mean, I don't know if Sony does this.

28:22.320 --> 28:25.960
Microsoft kind of knows what you're playing all the time because you hit that little button

28:25.960 --> 28:28.480
to see your friends list, you can see what they're all playing.

28:28.480 --> 28:32.240
And Major Nelson posts every week, hey, these are the top 10 games on live.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.120
So they kind of know what people are playing.

28:34.120 --> 28:39.120
I guess only out of those boxes that are connected to live, that's still a pretty good representation.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.360
I don't know.

28:41.360 --> 28:43.280
We'll see.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.960
Anyhow, one other thing that you could be playing on the PlayStation 3, and who knows

28:46.960 --> 28:51.080
how many ads are going to be in this game, Gran Turismo 5.

28:51.080 --> 28:56.200
Gran Turismo 5 will probably not see release until late 2008.

28:56.200 --> 29:01.880
This was something that director Kaonori Yamauchi said to Car and Driver magazine.

29:01.880 --> 29:05.600
Because spring of 2008 is the earliest possible release window for the game.

29:05.600 --> 29:11.960
Sony is trying to get them to push the date, but they want the game to be absolutely perfect.

29:11.960 --> 29:16.640
He did say, though, that there would be no crash damage physics.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.760
The perfect damage system will actually be changing the physics of the game and modeling

29:20.760 --> 29:23.160
of each panel of each car separately.

29:23.160 --> 29:27.400
So I have no idea, but they're taking out crash damage physics.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.840
But they did it in Forza.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.760
Why can't they do it in Gran Turismo 5?

29:32.760 --> 29:33.760
No idea.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.600
It's kind of a weird, weird thing.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.600
It's not a big deal.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.880
I mean, Project Gotham, I don't think, does damage physics either.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.000
At least it's not that I'm aware of.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.240
I guess not every racing game does.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.720
I mean, Gran Turismo is not Burnout.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.440
But I guess maybe that's why I kind of get a weird phase.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.440
Because when I think about playing racing games, I like racing games like Burnout, where

29:53.440 --> 29:55.340
the point is to crash into shit.

29:55.340 --> 29:57.780
And so I go, no crashing physics?

29:57.780 --> 29:59.360
What the hell kind of racing game is this?

29:59.360 --> 30:01.000
But then I go, yeah, that's right.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.560
I've never really been a fan of Gran Turismo because I like my racers fake.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.160
Not real.

30:08.160 --> 30:14.520
Anyways, once again if you're hoping to see some cool shit, especially Final Fantasy 13

30:14.520 --> 30:21.120
at E3, well, you better forget it because it's not going to be at E3 at all.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.040
So boo-hoo.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.680
Not surprising though, because I know Square Enix this year, they've been doing a lot

30:25.680 --> 30:30.660
of Nintendo stuff like DS and PSP titles, and I think there's actually some Wii titles

30:30.660 --> 30:31.880
in there as well.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.040
Why did they decide not to bring Final Fantasy 13?

30:35.040 --> 30:36.400
It's probably not done yet.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.400
Duh.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.320
I mean, obviously, how long did it take 12 to come out?

30:40.320 --> 30:43.120
Well they had a freaking trailer at one, why does Square do that?

30:43.120 --> 30:46.840
I remember my very first E3 they showed Final Fantasy 12 and then it wasn't even there

30:46.840 --> 30:47.840
the next year.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.840
Yeah, but here's the thing though.

30:48.840 --> 30:53.440
They show you a trailer, but then, you know, we'll use Sony, and I think Microsoft used

30:53.440 --> 30:58.180
the phrase, mainly Sony though, it's a target render.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.360
This is what we hope the game to look like.

31:00.360 --> 31:04.660
Oh, okay, thank you very much for getting my hopes up.

31:04.660 --> 31:08.480
It's not exactly what the game is going to look like, but it's a target, you know, so

31:08.480 --> 31:09.600
I'm going to strive to.

31:09.600 --> 31:13.160
I mean, I'm sure the game's still going to look phenomenal and exceed a lot of folks'

31:13.160 --> 31:14.160
expectations.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.520
I mean, let's face it, Square's always pushed the envelope in that department, you know.

31:17.520 --> 31:23.560
Oh, don't get me wrong, it's going to be awesome, but I'm more excited seeing, what is it, Last

31:23.560 --> 31:24.560
Remnant.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.560
That looks pretty cool.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.900
That could be pretty awesome.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.480
That's one in the Unreal Engine, huh?

31:28.480 --> 31:31.880
I think that's going to be there, in trailer form.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.200
You'll see, well, regardless, I don't know about you guys, but I'm kind of pissed that

31:35.200 --> 31:38.560
Final Fantasy XIII isn't going to be at E3, because that was a game I was really looking

31:38.560 --> 31:42.920
forward to, and the game that would have finally made me buy a PlayStation 3, hands down, but

31:42.920 --> 31:46.840
now that it's not going to be at E3, I'm a little bit angsty, and when we get angsty

31:46.840 --> 31:58.040
here at Orange Lawns Radio, people die, and we bring on the FUs of the Week.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.280
Dark Sakura, take it away.

32:00.280 --> 32:06.720
My FU of the Week goes toward, um, crap I can't do anything about right now.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.600
Very vague FU of the Week, but that's alright.

32:08.600 --> 32:14.680
Well, just like lots of stuff, you know, things that I can work toward that, uh, you know,

32:14.680 --> 32:18.200
are going to take a lot of hard work that aren't immediate.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.640
I would like to see immediate results.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.840
Unfortunately in the real world, it doesn't quite work that way, does it?

32:22.840 --> 32:25.600
So your FU is to patience, in a way.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.600
And money.

32:26.600 --> 32:27.600
Okay.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.600
Patience and money.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.600
Patience and money.

32:29.600 --> 32:35.560
My FU goes to Stella the Kitty, because she, uh, aw, I want to meet your new kitty!

32:35.560 --> 32:41.720
She's very persistent on chewing the power cord to the fan, and the light in our house,

32:41.720 --> 32:45.240
and she doesn't realize that there's a lot of electricity going through that, and unfortunately

32:45.240 --> 32:49.880
she does, very persistent on it, no matter where you move the fan, she always wants to

32:49.880 --> 32:50.880
chew on the cords, so.

32:50.880 --> 32:51.880
You know what you should get?

32:51.880 --> 32:52.880
A square bottle.

32:52.880 --> 32:53.880
No.

32:53.880 --> 32:54.880
Bitter apple spray.

32:54.880 --> 32:55.880
Ah, yeah.

32:55.880 --> 33:02.160
Cats, cats are very sensitive in their noses, and, um, bitter apple is, um, a scent that

33:02.160 --> 33:07.440
cats do not really quite care for, except unless they're nuts like one of my old cats.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.360
He would lick it.

33:09.360 --> 33:10.360
That cat was insane.

33:10.360 --> 33:14.560
You do know your cat is named after a popular Atari 2600 emulator?

33:14.560 --> 33:17.680
Well, you know, I didn't name the cat.

33:17.680 --> 33:24.160
Actually the woman, the woman that, uh, you know, was fostering the cat, um, I guess Stella's

33:24.160 --> 33:26.800
full, she calls her Stella-dora, so I don't know.

33:26.800 --> 33:30.600
I'm totally gonna cat her to take pictures of your cat.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.600
We've got plenty more.

33:31.600 --> 33:32.960
I brought my camera, too, so.

33:32.960 --> 33:36.720
You should tell your wife that there's a video game reference in your cat's name, she'll

33:36.720 --> 33:37.720
love that.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.080
She will absolutely love that.

33:40.080 --> 33:44.720
Well, my cat was trying to play, um, the PSP last night, or basically she was trying to

33:44.720 --> 33:49.440
chew on the headphone cord that I had while I was trying to play the PSP, but I moved

33:49.440 --> 33:52.480
around the stuff in Final Fantasy and she was like, hey, there's stuff moving on the

33:52.480 --> 33:55.600
screen, she kind of, like, got closer and closer and closer.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.920
So pretty soon we'll have the cat playing the PSP or something, or, yeah.

33:58.920 --> 33:59.920
You wanna watch her go crazy?

33:59.920 --> 34:00.920
Take pictures of her.

34:00.920 --> 34:01.920
Get the Jingle Cats video.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.920
No, I need the cat.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.720
I wanna see Stella versus Shermy.

34:04.720 --> 34:10.220
Shermy will just sit there and be like, hi, I'm the fattest cat in the universe.

34:10.220 --> 34:11.220
Shermy will do that.

34:11.220 --> 34:12.280
She's like the blob.

34:12.280 --> 34:13.280
Shermy is like E. Honda.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.280
No, she can't.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.920
She'll just jump up in the air and sit on Stella.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.720
Shermy is like the blob, the immovable object.

34:19.720 --> 34:22.960
All right, no force on earth can move the Shermy.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.080
Can I do my FUs now?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.080
Okay.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.160
All right, my FU of the week goes to my new driver's license picture.

34:28.160 --> 34:29.160
It's horrible.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.160
Oh, come on, Rob.

34:30.160 --> 34:31.720
Your face does not look that fat.

34:31.720 --> 34:34.440
My face looks like a Christmas light.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.100
It's red and fat.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.100
It's horrible.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.840
I just had to get a new license picture taken.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.920
My birthday just passed since that year that my license.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.280
I had to go in and take a new picture.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.840
I look fat and red.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.840
You do not.

34:44.840 --> 34:45.840
It's horrible.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.840
I look like I have a bowl full of jelly.

34:46.840 --> 34:47.840
That's what I do.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.840
It's horrible.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.840
FU to the DMV.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.160
Why do you do this to people?

34:52.160 --> 34:56.320
This is why we have rampant anorexia and bulimia in our society is because of the DMV.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.320
That's all.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.660
I'm done.

34:58.660 --> 35:00.920
And no, chat room, you may not have a scan.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.560
That's personal information.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.960
I'm not scanning my driver's license and putting it on the internet.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.640
That's one of the dumbest things you can do.

35:06.640 --> 35:10.460
All right, let's get back into the gaming news before I get more frustrated because

35:10.460 --> 35:12.920
like then I'm going to take out my wallet and look at my picture again.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.960
I'm going to get more angrier.

35:14.960 --> 35:21.840
Well, Rob, I'm sorry I'm about to piss you off again.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.680
Now don't we normally love Nintendo?

35:23.680 --> 35:25.120
I love Nintendo.

35:25.120 --> 35:33.000
Nintendo, we love you so much, but why do you have to hurt us by not having a playable

35:33.000 --> 35:37.120
Smash Brothers at E3?

35:37.120 --> 35:39.840
Fuckers.

35:39.840 --> 35:44.440
So Nintendo's not going to be showing Smash Brothers at E3?

35:44.440 --> 35:45.440
And you know what they just...

35:45.440 --> 35:46.440
What's their excuse?

35:46.440 --> 35:47.440
They just...

35:47.440 --> 35:52.200
Well, it wasn't in Kojima's blog that he played an almost complete version.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.200
Like in April.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.200
So why not?

35:54.200 --> 35:55.200
Why are you fucking with us, Nintendo?

35:55.200 --> 35:56.200
Give us a playable Smash Brothers or I'll head up to Washington, beat you in the head

35:56.200 --> 35:59.200
with an orange bat, fly to Japan, and run over your headquarters with a tank.

35:59.200 --> 36:07.200
Give us a playable Smash Brothers or I'll head up to Washington, beat you in the head

36:07.200 --> 36:15.560
with an orange bat, fly to Japan, and run over your headquarters with a tank.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.560
Give me!

36:16.560 --> 36:19.320
I need my pit and I need my snake.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.320
The end.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.320
I got a snake, man.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.320
I got a snake, man.

36:23.320 --> 36:30.000
One time I fed my snakes some beer.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.720
Let's see.

36:31.720 --> 36:32.720
Going to chat room.

36:32.720 --> 36:37.720
TLUT says, like we don't know how Smash Brothers is going to play?

36:37.720 --> 36:38.780
I don't care.

36:38.780 --> 36:39.780
My God.

36:39.780 --> 36:48.200
They do a damn update on the website every day and every blog on the face of the earth

36:48.200 --> 36:51.200
covers the damn website.

36:51.200 --> 36:54.220
Just go to the website and check it out each day.

36:54.220 --> 36:58.560
We don't need to hear or see it updated every day.

36:58.560 --> 37:03.000
I don't give a crap about the final moves and the control scheme and all that shit.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.320
Just wait for the game to come out.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.320
Be surprised.

37:08.320 --> 37:16.560
Well, as if I wish I had good news for you, but the journey continues here with Nintendo

37:16.560 --> 37:19.520
and what they are and aren't going to be showing at E3.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.560
Actually this has nothing to do with what's at E3.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.960
This is just the way it is.

37:23.960 --> 37:28.840
Michael Kelba, who is actually the head of Retro Studios who is designing of course Metroid

37:28.840 --> 37:33.800
Prime 3 corruption, in an interview recently with GamePro, he has confirmed that there

37:33.800 --> 37:41.140
will be no online multiplayer in Metroid Prime 3 corruption.

37:41.140 --> 37:47.380
Those of us that were hoping and thinking and speculating and convinced that Nintendo

37:47.380 --> 37:52.060
is finally going to get into online gaming, they're finally going to open up to the world

37:52.060 --> 37:55.120
of online gaming and Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the game that will do it.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.500
We just got fucking shot down this week.

37:57.500 --> 38:04.560
Way to brace next gen, or this gen, last gen, I don't know, online.

38:04.560 --> 38:14.440
God damn it, this makes me angry.

38:14.440 --> 38:17.600
Why won't you embrace online gaming Nintendo?

38:17.600 --> 38:22.040
What did Phantasy Star Online episodes 1 and 2 burn you that badly?

38:22.040 --> 38:25.760
What is your big problem with online gaming?

38:25.760 --> 38:29.400
Why do you have to spray us with these friend codes crap?

38:29.400 --> 38:32.280
Why won't you put your series that we love online?

38:32.280 --> 38:36.160
Why do you give us something crappy like the new Pokemon game that's your only online game

38:36.160 --> 38:38.400
and mediocre online stuff anyway?

38:38.400 --> 38:46.840
Why will you not wake up to the next generation of gaming?

38:46.840 --> 38:52.680
And I copy everything that Jamie said before about the game.

38:52.680 --> 38:53.680
Anyways, more positive news.

38:53.680 --> 38:56.920
Wait a minute, hold on, no, no, no, I'm going to chat for a minute.

38:56.920 --> 39:00.920
Hitstun says even fucking Virtua Fighter 5 is going to be online now.

39:00.920 --> 39:06.220
You know when a shitatious series like Virtua Fighter goes online and Metroid is still single

39:06.220 --> 39:07.640
player only.

39:07.640 --> 39:12.880
Something is fucked in this world.

39:12.880 --> 39:18.160
RosteelUT says no Metroid Prime 3 online, good, Nintendo Online sucks anyway, but it

39:18.160 --> 39:19.680
could have been better.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.280
Jvmon says Pokemon Online is slow as hell.

39:22.280 --> 39:30.880
The DS games are fine, Nintendo can do it, they're just not doing it for some reason.

39:30.880 --> 39:35.120
RosteelUT says people who play Nintendo systems don't want online, those who want to play

39:35.120 --> 39:36.720
online have 360.

39:36.720 --> 39:41.960
I beg to differ, if you give them online, they will embrace online.

39:41.960 --> 39:47.720
Moms and grandmas like to play Bejeweled Online and those fucking Popit games on Pogo and

39:47.720 --> 39:51.420
shit and all those other games, like Poker Online, they'll play that, they'll play the

39:51.420 --> 39:56.140
Wii Online too, they'll give me that just because it's not a hardcore gaming audience

39:56.140 --> 39:57.140
or whatever.

39:57.140 --> 40:01.360
This just makes me angry because I've been waiting so long for Nintendo to go online.

40:01.360 --> 40:08.600
Was last year's E3, we're embracing online, the system is going to be, Nintendo is going

40:08.600 --> 40:13.840
to be providing new content daily and every day you're going to be able to go to your

40:13.840 --> 40:19.840
Nintendo Wii system and see new content, whether it be game downloads or all this shit or how

40:19.840 --> 40:24.880
about, what else were they promising that was going to be really cool.

40:24.880 --> 40:32.720
The Wii Connect 24, providing updates automatically, notice all these promises and nothing following

40:32.720 --> 40:33.720
through.

40:33.720 --> 40:37.260
You know, I will let this slide Nintendo because you know what, in all honesty, Metroid will

40:37.260 --> 40:39.600
never be as good 3D as it was in 2D.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.840
You can argue with me all you want on that one, but I just feel very strongly that Super

40:42.840 --> 40:46.820
Metroid was the all-time greatest Metroid game, and there will never be a Metroid game

40:46.820 --> 40:48.720
as good as Super Metroid.

40:48.720 --> 40:58.600
Unless they do a new one in the vein of Super Metroid on the DS.

40:58.600 --> 41:05.720
Well kinda, I mean on the Advance there was Zero Mission or whatever, but it's not the

41:05.720 --> 41:10.600
same on a tiny screen, that's the problem, it's not the same on a tiny screen.

41:10.600 --> 41:17.000
The first time I played Super Metroid and Kraid, you know, multi-story boss on the TV,

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
that was the shit.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.080
The Brinstar music.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.080
You can't duplicate that on a DS.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.080
Rob.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.080
Rob.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.080
Rob.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.080
What?

41:26.080 --> 41:27.200
What are you doing on Thursday?

41:27.200 --> 41:28.440
I don't know, what?

41:28.440 --> 41:30.440
We are playing Super Metroid.

41:30.440 --> 41:34.240
You are coming to my house and we are playing Super Metroid on my 50 inch widescreen.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.680
I'll try to make that happen if we're not house hunting because I am in the middle of

41:36.680 --> 41:37.680
that right now.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.240
But anyway, what was I ranting about Metroid?

41:39.240 --> 41:43.280
Oh, Nintendo, prove me wrong then about this whole online thing.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.520
Let that be your cards on the table at E3.

41:45.520 --> 41:49.340
I will let this Metroid Prime 3 corruption thing slide if you tell me that Smash Brothers

41:49.340 --> 41:51.600
is going to be online.

41:51.600 --> 41:56.400
I will throw myself in front of Jamie's tank to stop her evil doings and then I will make

41:56.400 --> 41:58.480
love to all of you.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.440
Fuck that, I want to see it actually be online.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.600
I don't want it being promised online.

42:02.600 --> 42:06.960
It's like they promised new fucking content each day on goddamn, you know, Wii Connect

42:06.960 --> 42:08.360
24.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.960
What's the point of having my damn system connected to the internet 24 hours a day if

42:11.960 --> 42:14.040
you're not going to do anything with it?

42:14.040 --> 42:19.280
Fuck, I even got to boot up my system before my messages will download onto it.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.680
What the hell is this Wii Connect 24 shit?

42:21.680 --> 42:26.520
Anyways, so hold on real quick, I'm sorry, sorry, real quick comments from chat.

42:26.520 --> 42:30.960
MikeW0440 says Metroid Prime was one of the greatest games of all time in some people's

42:30.960 --> 42:31.960
opinion.

42:31.960 --> 42:33.800
That's right, and some people are entitled to be wrong.

42:33.800 --> 42:34.800
That's fine.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.800
I'm just kidding.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.960
Prime was a great game, but Super Metroid was better.

42:37.960 --> 42:38.960
That's all.

42:38.960 --> 42:42.280
GS191 says Nintendo is labeled a big disappointment.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.560
If they add something, people want more.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.440
Nintendo is placed on a very high pedestal and is judged as such.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.680
You know that's true.

42:48.680 --> 42:54.440
As mad as I am right, Nintendo has the most to lose going into this E3, right?

42:54.440 --> 42:57.560
Sony has the most to gain, Nintendo has the most to lose.

42:57.560 --> 43:03.040
The problem is like Nintendo, they mark themselves as being innovative, and they are in certain

43:03.040 --> 43:08.280
aspects, but in other aspects, they're making really stupid mistakes.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.440
Not a lot of storage on their system.

43:10.440 --> 43:13.440
Not allowing third party or outside storage.

43:13.440 --> 43:19.080
Granted, they do have the SD memory cards, but other than transferring your game saves

43:19.080 --> 43:25.760
off of it and maybe playing some MP3s in Excite Truck, it's not being used, or I don't know,

43:25.760 --> 43:29.200
the whole online thing.

43:29.200 --> 43:34.200
It's all these promises, and you get your hopes up, and then they don't fucking deliver.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.480
I want delivery, dammit.

43:36.480 --> 43:41.940
Please read a story that will not make me want to play the FU music again.

43:41.940 --> 43:48.920
Nintendo in Japan, they're of course Club Nintendo, including they have a lot of exclusive

43:48.920 --> 43:53.860
games that get released on there, and they get to buy them off with points that you earn

43:53.860 --> 43:56.480
from buying different Nintendo games and stuff.

43:56.480 --> 44:05.120
Such wonderful games include the Game & Watch Collection for the DS, Tingle's Balloon Fight,

44:05.120 --> 44:08.560
and now Exclamation Warriors.

44:08.560 --> 44:17.560
It's a bizarre DS game that uses the microphone for gameplay, so it's kind of like a Sentai

44:17.560 --> 44:22.600
Hero type thing, like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and you basically yell your attacks

44:22.600 --> 44:28.240
and stuff, so you know, like TRANSFORM, and that's how you play the game.

44:28.240 --> 44:35.280
It's like PUNCH, KICK, and they have like some video of people playing it and stuff,

44:35.280 --> 44:37.000
so it's very strange.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.040
It's something that would probably do pretty well over here, but of course we'll never

44:41.040 --> 44:42.040
see it.

44:42.040 --> 44:51.000
I could imagine Loki playing this game, PUNCH, KICK, KICK, KICK GOD DAMN IT I SAY KICK NO

44:51.000 --> 44:59.120
I SAY KICK BRU BRU

44:59.120 --> 45:02.760
Yeah my voice was already leaving before tonight's show by the way, tonight's show is just making

45:02.760 --> 45:05.520
it worse, I just kind of wanted to get that out there because I can feel myself losing

45:05.520 --> 45:09.280
my voice, it was already going away last night, that's just great.

45:09.280 --> 45:14.180
This show is very healthy for me, I think I just shaved five years off of my life with

45:14.180 --> 45:17.240
tonight's bout of anger.

45:17.240 --> 45:23.840
I have bouts of anger every day, usually when I go to work, this actually makes me a little

45:23.840 --> 45:24.840
angry too.

45:24.840 --> 45:30.000
Guess the game they're bringing out on the Wii and DS?

45:30.000 --> 45:31.480
Lord knows what, Mario?

45:31.480 --> 45:32.480
Jenga!

45:32.480 --> 45:34.440
Wait, like the board game Jenga?

45:34.440 --> 45:37.520
It's not a board game, it's the stacking game, you know where you have all the blocks and

45:37.520 --> 45:39.520
you have to pull one out and put it up at the top?

45:39.520 --> 45:45.160
But Jenga's only fun if you have all the blocks to fall all over people.

45:45.160 --> 45:50.720
Okay people, step away from the credit card.

45:50.720 --> 45:51.760
Here's why.

45:51.760 --> 45:57.080
Why the fuck would you buy a game that's probably not going to play very well, granted, okay

45:57.080 --> 46:03.120
yeah it's the Wii, you can use the Wii Remote too, okay but yeah, honestly, the Wii is not

46:03.120 --> 46:04.440
that sensitive.

46:04.440 --> 46:10.120
Jenga doesn't cost, I would imagine it's probably less than $10, and you're going to buy a game

46:10.120 --> 46:15.080
for at least $20, and that's the low end.

46:15.080 --> 46:19.260
I bet this Wii version would not have truth or dare Jenga on it, and there is a truth

46:19.260 --> 46:21.940
or dare Jenga game available, it's kind of fun.

46:21.940 --> 46:25.240
So I don't understand why people do this shit.

46:25.240 --> 46:29.120
Because people are too lazy to put the block sculpture together, because it is a little

46:29.120 --> 46:32.280
bit painstaking, I mean you have to put three this way, then three this way, then three

46:32.280 --> 46:33.280
this way.

46:33.280 --> 46:35.960
Oh my god, and you can just like, I don't know, stack it in the plastic thing that comes

46:35.960 --> 46:36.960
with it.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.640
Oh that's so difficult, so difficult!

46:38.640 --> 46:42.760
That is a lot of effort for some people.

46:42.760 --> 46:46.640
What can you imagine though, taking it out with the Wii Remote and stuff like that, and

46:46.640 --> 46:52.140
all of a sudden your IR gets fucked up because something shiny is in the room and it knocks

46:52.140 --> 46:55.760
the whole thing over and you're like, fucking A, why the hell did I pay money for this damn

46:55.760 --> 46:56.760
game?

46:56.760 --> 46:59.540
I was doing it perfect and it fucked it up, what the hell?

46:59.540 --> 47:04.520
Maybe this version of Jenga will actually be online, you could play online.

47:04.520 --> 47:08.560
Oh yeah, oh wait, Nintendo, never mind.

47:08.560 --> 47:12.480
It can't be online, because that's not possible.

47:12.480 --> 47:17.160
Yeah, I agree, I have no idea why this game exists.

47:17.160 --> 47:19.560
But we can talk about some games that will exist pretty soon.

47:19.560 --> 47:22.160
Jamie, are you excited about Jenga on the Wii?

47:22.160 --> 47:25.320
No, I want, I miss my actual Jenga.

47:25.320 --> 47:30.520
We should play Truth or Dare Jenga on OLR one night during a slow news week, because

47:30.520 --> 47:34.240
the little blocks that you pull out have little questions on them that you have to answer,

47:34.240 --> 47:38.000
or little dares you have to do, or it's dumb stuff.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.800
It's like a Mormon Truth or Dare game, you're not going to do anything that dirty.

47:41.800 --> 47:48.080
Anyway, let's talk about some upcoming release dates over in Japan and some things you can

47:48.080 --> 47:50.040
get your hands on pretty soon.

47:50.040 --> 47:56.400
Let's talk about the Xbox 360 on July 12th, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

47:56.400 --> 48:02.700
2 makes its way to the Japanese audience thanks to Ubisoft, that's on the Xbox 360.

48:02.700 --> 48:07.120
Going over to some other platforms on the Nintendo Wii, Dragon Quest Swords finally

48:07.120 --> 48:11.920
shows up on July 12th from Squeenix on the Nintendo Wii.

48:11.920 --> 48:16.360
Not a very busy release week, but if you go over to the PlayStation 3, you get Gundam

48:16.360 --> 48:20.640
Musou, but that's actually coming out in Korea, I'm not sure if that's also coming out in

48:20.640 --> 48:23.680
Japan, but it is coming out over there.

48:23.680 --> 48:27.680
It's the same TV type anyway, actually the same TV is over here.

48:27.680 --> 48:31.680
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, a lot of the Grand Theft Auto games are going into

48:31.680 --> 48:35.760
the best hits, so they're getting big price reductions over there in Japan.

48:35.760 --> 48:40.160
Also Disgaea Hour of Darkness 2 is also getting a price cut.

48:40.160 --> 48:44.440
Not a whole lot of new games coming out over there in Japan, although if you're a music

48:44.440 --> 48:48.720
game fan, you probably already have Pop and Music 14 Fever preordered.

48:48.720 --> 48:52.980
Pop and Music 14, of course, the long running music game series, it's kind of like a cross

48:52.980 --> 48:58.620
between Beat Mania and Trouble with the Pop-O-Matic Bubble, because the controller looks like

48:58.620 --> 49:00.480
seven of those and you hit them.

49:00.480 --> 49:03.560
If you ever watch that movie, what the hell is that movie?

49:03.560 --> 49:07.040
Lost in Translation, which is walking through the arcade, you see somebody freestyling on

49:07.040 --> 49:09.440
Pop and Music, it's pretty awesome.

49:09.440 --> 49:15.440
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, there's a game called Izumo Zero, it's an adventure

49:15.440 --> 49:17.140
game.

49:17.140 --> 49:22.080
It's yet another title that has a very nice looking anime chick on the front, I'm sure

49:22.080 --> 49:24.840
that's like every other game of that type.

49:24.840 --> 49:29.200
I'm totally labeling this based on the box art alone.

49:29.200 --> 49:34.760
On the Nintendo DS, Death Note, there's a Death Note game coming out from Konami.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.000
I need this.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.020
So you'll like that one.

49:38.020 --> 49:43.200
And Monster Farm DS also coming out, and one of my favorite titles, I have no idea what

49:43.200 --> 49:50.000
this is supposed to mean, but it's Kyurin Revolution Mezase Idol Queen, it's a strategy

49:50.000 --> 49:57.120
game from Konami, but it looks like a pop idol kind of contest, and the chick's wearing

49:57.120 --> 50:00.440
a cowboy hat and winking at you on the box art cover, so I have no idea what the hell

50:00.440 --> 50:02.520
that game's supposed to be.

50:02.520 --> 50:10.040
Over on the PSP, coming out on July 12th over in Japan, you have Tekken Dark Resurrection

50:10.040 --> 50:12.920
getting a price cut, and that's it, no new games.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.520
There you have it, Japanese releases.

50:14.520 --> 50:20.520
I was going to mention something real quick, the DDR Hottest Party page finally made it

50:20.520 --> 50:24.720
up on the Japanese site for Konami, and I thought there was some intro, they had quotes

50:24.720 --> 50:30.440
from all the music directors and stuff from other Bomani games in Japan, and they have

50:30.440 --> 50:36.280
some really interesting quotes like, this game is killing it, the Dance Dance Revolution

50:36.280 --> 50:41.160
Extreme director, Inubuzu, which I thought was funny.

50:41.160 --> 50:44.760
That's what happens when I don't play DDR for like six months, and then I try to play

50:44.760 --> 50:50.960
like a ten foot song on the arcade, I go, this game is killing me.

50:50.960 --> 50:51.960
You know.

50:51.960 --> 50:52.960
What?

50:52.960 --> 50:56.000
I actually passed a nine footer the other day.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Wow can I shake your hand?

50:57.000 --> 50:58.560
After a year of not playing.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.840
No that's good, but did you want to die afterwards?

51:01.840 --> 51:03.800
Yes I did freaking kakame!

51:03.800 --> 51:06.000
This game is killing it!

51:06.000 --> 51:09.580
Anyhow, more release dates please, Loki.

51:09.580 --> 51:14.960
Well if you're looking for console games this week, keep looking.

51:14.960 --> 51:19.960
The only thing that you are going to find though is Project Silpheed for the 360, that's

51:19.960 --> 51:21.680
going to be making its way out this week.

51:21.680 --> 51:23.120
Didn't that already come out?

51:23.120 --> 51:24.120
No.

51:24.120 --> 51:27.800
It is coming out this week though.

51:27.800 --> 51:29.120
That's about it for console games.

51:29.120 --> 51:34.680
Now for handhelds though, we've got a few things, Smash Court Tennis 3 is coming out

51:34.680 --> 51:43.120
to the PSP, as well as Riviera, The Promised Land is also making its way out to the PSP.

51:43.120 --> 51:49.560
See for the DS, just Vegas Casino High Five, that's making its way out.

51:49.560 --> 51:58.040
And then on the PC, not a whole lot of good stuff, but yet again, it doesn't cease to

51:58.040 --> 52:05.120
amaze me, another Tycoon game, Ride Carnival Tycoon, coming out, I swear to god there's

52:05.120 --> 52:07.880
a new one every fucking week.

52:07.880 --> 52:14.560
I can probably play that piece of shit online, but I still can't take my Wii online.

52:14.560 --> 52:18.840
Anyhow, how about some European release dates for the listeners?

52:18.840 --> 52:22.720
Well we have a few interesting things.

52:22.720 --> 52:29.440
Actually on the 13th is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on Game Boy Advance,

52:29.440 --> 52:35.160
Mario Party 8 for Wii, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, also on the 13th

52:35.160 --> 52:36.160
for PC.

52:36.160 --> 52:42.440
On the 20th we have The Darkness and Transformers The Game on DS, sorry, the DS release.

52:42.440 --> 52:47.360
And then on the 21st, the one thing everybody's been looking forward to on the PC, this is

52:47.360 --> 52:51.640
so exciting, Brian Lara's International Cricket.

52:51.640 --> 52:52.640
Hooray!

52:52.640 --> 52:56.440
I'm so excited.

52:56.440 --> 52:59.080
Because everybody loves cricket.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.840
Yeah.

53:00.840 --> 53:06.520
And to that statement, I hear a chorus of crickets in the background, wah wah wah, oh

53:06.520 --> 53:07.520
god I'm fired.

53:07.520 --> 53:10.880
Wasn't that that little doll that you'd put the tape in her back and she'd read you a

53:10.880 --> 53:11.880
story?

53:11.880 --> 53:12.880
What?

53:12.880 --> 53:13.880
It was called Cricket.

53:13.880 --> 53:14.880
It was Teddy Ruxpin.

53:14.880 --> 53:16.280
Have you been reading Penny Arcade lately?

53:16.280 --> 53:17.280
No.

53:17.280 --> 53:22.280
They're doing like, I don't read, they're doing like hardcore Teddy Ruxpin, the action

53:22.280 --> 53:23.280
hero.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.560
Now that's cool.

53:24.560 --> 53:28.040
There should be, there should be like a fighting game with our childhood favorites, like Teddy

53:28.040 --> 53:30.800
Ruxpin versus Cabbage Patch Doll.

53:30.800 --> 53:35.280
Now here's the thing, you probably never played this game, but it's a, I don't know if it's

53:35.280 --> 53:40.040
a tabletop RPG, but it is an RPG.

53:40.040 --> 53:46.120
It's called Fuzzy Heroes, and you use stuffed animals as, I swear to god, you use stuffed

53:46.120 --> 53:52.240
animals as characters in the game, and based on what the stuffed animal has, the attributes

53:52.240 --> 53:57.560
and stuff, you have different attack abilities, and it's a tactical, like, I guess I don't

53:57.560 --> 54:02.480
know what you'd call it, tabletop RPG, but it's basically like a tabletop RPG, and you

54:02.480 --> 54:06.280
move them around and stuff and you attack with different abilities, like so for example,

54:06.280 --> 54:10.520
I had, we had brought, and we only played this game once, and it kind of sucked.

54:10.520 --> 54:11.640
What is this game called again?

54:11.640 --> 54:12.640
Fuzzy Heroes.

54:12.640 --> 54:14.640
This is like a furry's paradise.

54:14.640 --> 54:22.480
And basically, like, I had the dragon from Fantasia, you know, that we got at Disneyland,

54:22.480 --> 54:25.920
and so, you know, because it's a dragon, you know, it would have, like, flight and fire

54:25.920 --> 54:32.160
and stuff like that, so, I don't know, this was a long time ago, but I don't know, it's,

54:32.160 --> 54:37.120
they could do something like that, I guess, with stuffed animals, it's an interesting

54:37.120 --> 54:38.120
idea.

54:38.120 --> 54:40.120
You could do that with them again.

54:40.120 --> 54:41.120
Yeah.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.120
Okay.

54:42.120 --> 54:43.120
What?

54:43.120 --> 54:45.040
Oh, my God, Rob.

54:45.040 --> 54:49.760
Here's what Miklotov, here's.

54:49.760 --> 54:50.880
Best radio ever.

54:50.880 --> 54:55.480
Sometimes I wish this were a TV show, but here is the present that Miklotov, Rice Princess,

54:55.480 --> 54:57.600
and Xtaphir all went together and got me.

54:57.600 --> 55:01.480
It's a panda bear wearing stripper boots and a tutu.

55:01.480 --> 55:02.480
A pink tutu.

55:02.480 --> 55:07.720
A pink tutu carrying a little wand with, Jonas just joined us, by the way, and he's making

55:07.720 --> 55:08.960
this face like OMG.

55:08.960 --> 55:12.720
Jonas, can you please describe this, her name is Sassy Pants, by the way.

55:12.720 --> 55:16.640
Can you please describe Sassy Pants to the listeners?

55:16.640 --> 55:17.640
And welcome to the show.

55:17.640 --> 55:18.640
How could I even explain?

55:18.640 --> 55:19.640
What the hell is this?

55:19.640 --> 55:22.800
It's a panda bear wearing a pink tutu and stripper boots.

55:22.800 --> 55:26.800
So what I'm curious, how would Sassy Pants fare in Fuzzy Heroes?

55:26.800 --> 55:30.920
Because I think she would dominate, because she can cast magic, true, she has stripper

55:30.920 --> 55:35.640
boots, so you know she can kick, so I want to play Fuzzy Heroes with Sassy Pants.

55:35.640 --> 55:40.800
I'm not sure, because I unfortunately don't have the rule book in front of me, because

55:40.800 --> 55:47.320
this is someone else's thing, but okay, it's a game, if you go to FuzzyHeroes.com,

55:47.320 --> 55:55.280
I think you can still buy the book, but anyways, it's created by Inner City Games Designs,

55:55.280 --> 55:59.120
and let me see if I can read a brief description of what the game is.

55:59.120 --> 56:04.480
Inner City Games Design is probably best known for our Fuzzy Heroes line of miniature gaming

56:04.480 --> 56:10.840
products, products that use stuffed toys and action figures as miniature combatants in

56:10.840 --> 56:13.120
a 3D strategic simulation.

56:13.120 --> 56:17.560
These games are designed to be introductory for those who are new to the miniatures hobby,

56:17.560 --> 56:24.440
but with both enough depth and humor to engage the veteran miniatures gamer as well.

56:24.440 --> 56:30.720
We still make Fuzzy Heroes and in fact are gearing up for another set of both games and

56:30.720 --> 56:35.800
comics for this line, I guess they have comics for this too.

56:35.800 --> 56:41.360
We also make several independent toy related games, including Very Large Creature, Stuffed

56:41.360 --> 56:49.520
Toys Vs. Miniatures, and Sports Fuzz, 3D football using toys, beer bottles, and whatever happens

56:49.520 --> 56:51.400
to be lying around.

56:51.400 --> 56:55.600
By the way, Sassy Pants' tiara fell off, so I found that in the living room, but there's

56:55.600 --> 56:58.680
also that, which must add some magical powers to it.

56:58.680 --> 57:03.480
I don't know, but I swear you can probably find this in a comic shop, anyplace that has

57:03.480 --> 57:07.080
the miniatures tabletop strategy games and stuff.

57:07.080 --> 57:09.080
We're spending far too much time on this topic.

57:09.080 --> 57:10.080
Sorry.

57:10.080 --> 57:11.080
No, it's funny.

57:11.080 --> 57:12.880
I'd never heard of this.

57:12.880 --> 57:16.320
It would be fun for like, that'd be a fun thing to record.

57:16.320 --> 57:19.800
Yeah, for a YouTube or something, OLR plays Fuzzy Heroes.

57:19.800 --> 57:24.600
I wanted to say though about the Harry Potter game that's coming out, it came out here obviously

57:24.600 --> 57:27.200
already, and I actually got to see it this week, I forgot to say it during my gameweek

57:27.200 --> 57:29.080
because I didn't play it, I watched somebody else play it.

57:29.080 --> 57:30.080
It looked boring.

57:30.080 --> 57:32.600
It looked like all the other Harry Potter games, they didn't look, I mean, because I

57:32.600 --> 57:33.600
was really excited.

57:33.600 --> 57:34.600
Those figures are not very great.

57:34.600 --> 57:38.000
I was excited about getting to cast magic with the wiimote and everything.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.680
The funniest thing though was when my friend Eddie, who was playing it, picked up the table

57:42.680 --> 57:43.920
and was slamming it into people.

57:43.920 --> 57:47.280
They would go, oh, oh, that hurts, oh, that hurts.

57:47.280 --> 57:48.840
The game's really funny.

57:48.840 --> 57:52.480
It's like, you go to Hogwarts and then you run errands through people.

57:52.480 --> 57:55.640
It's like Hogwarts errand boy, the game is really what the hell...

57:55.640 --> 57:58.880
No, it's like Animal Crossing at Hogwarts.

57:58.880 --> 58:00.840
Except Animal Crossing is more fun?

58:00.840 --> 58:01.840
Yeah.

58:01.840 --> 58:05.040
Instead of shaking trees, you get beaten up by the whomping willow.

58:05.040 --> 58:10.480
Anyway, I just wanted to say that real quickly because I actually played the Harry Potter,

58:10.480 --> 58:13.920
well, I watched the Harry Potter game and it wasn't all that.

58:13.920 --> 58:19.360
Anyway, Australia, we haven't talked a lot about what's going on in Australia, but

58:19.360 --> 58:23.860
if you are a Wii owner in Australia, you have some good news for you this week.

58:23.860 --> 58:28.080
You got a ton of virtual console games this week, which is very interesting and that's

58:28.080 --> 58:33.020
why we're kind of wanting to report on the show is that Nintendo can certainly just push

58:33.020 --> 58:35.320
out like a shitload of games all at once.

58:35.320 --> 58:38.600
Listen to this, Australia's got like all of this in one week here.

58:38.600 --> 58:42.960
Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman 93, Superstar Soldier, Victory Run, Alien Crush, Military

58:42.960 --> 58:47.500
Madness, R-Type, Dungeon Explorer, Soldier Blade, Motor Roader, and Vigilante.

58:47.500 --> 58:51.240
So if you're a TurboGrafx fan in Australia, you had a very good week this week.

58:51.240 --> 58:53.240
Hey, Rob, while we're at it.

58:53.240 --> 59:00.000
Um, there were actually new releases for, um, uh, and actually now I'm trying to find

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
them again.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.120
There were new releases for a virtual console in the UK as well and I unfortunately just

59:06.120 --> 59:07.960
lost my link to it.

59:07.960 --> 59:10.120
Super Mario Brothers 2 in the US.

59:10.120 --> 59:11.120
Oh, and over there?

59:11.120 --> 59:12.920
I do believe that was one of them.

59:12.920 --> 59:17.320
I had just had it and I feel really crappy about it because, um, I just looked all this

59:17.320 --> 59:18.320
up last night.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.800
I think Paper Mario is supposed to be coming over here pretty soon too.

59:20.800 --> 59:23.800
They said what's coming out over here on Monday?

59:23.800 --> 59:24.800
Nothing yet?

59:24.800 --> 59:27.880
I saw Paper Mario 4, I think, is one of the other regions.

59:27.880 --> 59:28.880
Here it is.

59:28.880 --> 59:29.880
Okay.

59:29.880 --> 59:35.040
The, uh, Virtual Console, um, for, uh, UK, actually Sonic the Hedgehog 2 just came out.

59:35.040 --> 59:43.000
Um, Golden Axe 2, Echo Tides of Time, Dragon Spirit, those are the games that just came

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
out.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.280
I think we got most of those over here already, I think.

59:46.280 --> 59:49.820
So for once, uh, Europe didn't beat us to the punch on Virtual Console because they

59:49.820 --> 59:50.820
have been lately.

59:50.820 --> 59:53.360
But they did get some really good games because I love Echo Tides of Time.

59:53.360 --> 59:58.960
Um, sadly though, I think this is the Mega Drive version and not the, uh, the Mega CD

59:58.960 --> 59:59.960
one.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.960
Oh, good point.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:05.120
James Patrick in chat says, Australia never saw the release of the TurboGrafx at all.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.640
So if you're a TurboGrafx fan living in Australia, you might be the only one.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640
You're a rarity.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.720
Either that or you were a major hardcore importer.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.360
Yeah, you're a hardcore importer.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360
Anyways.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.560
Um, another game that's coming out here later in the fall, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles,

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.720
is going to be supporting co-op gameplay as well.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:29.520
I mean, what good gun game doesn't support, you know, co-op play, but, um, you'll be able

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.080
to kill zombies and whatnot, uh, with a friend.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.220
I think, obviously though, it's probably local co-op and not online because, you know.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.220
It is on the Wii.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.480
They should totally have it to where you are one person and then other people control the

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.480
zombies.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.560
Sort of like that Pac-Man game.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.560
That would be fun.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.520
You could, I want Zombie the game where you are a zombie.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.000
Why haven't, why hasn't a game like that been made?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
That's a brilliant idea.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
They need to do more.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
What?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.040
They did an online game, I thought, with Resident Evil where if you got bit, you became a zombie

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.040
and stuff.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.920
But I think they should do Marvel Zombies the game.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.480
Or you're a superhero zombie.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.920
Or a George Romero zombie type game or something.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.880
I don't know, I guess that's what Dead Rising was.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.440
But like one where you actually get to be the zombie.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440
That would be kind of fun.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440
Like an online game.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.480
Oh, I guess that was Resident Evil on PS2, wasn't it?

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.840
I want Marvel Zombies the game.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.480
But make it good this time.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480
Make it memorable.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.560
Well, hey, I have something that's memorable.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.560
What's that?

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.000
People were crackheads like me back in the day.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.440
Ragnarok Online is going to be on Japanese DS in 2008.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:40.920
The game is also going to be released with Sakana no Asobo, which is a fishing game.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:49.040
And a, sorry, there's actually going to be an Ikebana game, Ikebana is flower arranging

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.040
by the way.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:57.720
But Ragnarok Online is going to be in real time using the Nintendo Wi-Fi.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.760
And it's supposed to be, I guess, tailored to the DS, but it's only going to be out in

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.080
Japan right now.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.160
Which means I'm going to be importing it and sitting around with my dictionary.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.160
Either that, or I will just probably remember where all the shit is anyway, because I played

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.960
Ragnarok Online for what, five, six years?

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.800
Well there's really only one phrase that you need to know in Japanese, and that's we ban

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.800
you.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.980
Yeah, but actually, the Rob D makes an interesting point, why are they calling it Ragnarok Online

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:25.980
when it's not online?

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.980
It is online.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.980
It's going to be on Wi-Fi.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.980
Oh.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:30.980
Huh?

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:31.980
Touche.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.260
So much for that.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.720
Also speaking of quirky games coming over from overseas, Majesco is going to be making

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.800
a local version of Furu Furu Park.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.620
It was a game that came out in Japan in April, and get this, it's a game on the Wii that

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:49.120
consists of mini games.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.720
Who doesn't love mini games on the Wii?

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.200
Good stuff.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.560
But the cool thing about it, in all seriousness, is that it's based off a lot of classic Taito

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.840
games that you've seen re-released in other bundles, but these are re-imagined games.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.560
Bubble Bobble, Arkanoid.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.360
Majesco's going to be localizing it here for North America, and making it all in English

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.360
and all that good stuff.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.360
I love Arkanoid.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.760
That is one of the mindless games that I absolutely just love, is Arkanoid.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.560
Will you be able to pass level 30?

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.840
I'm pretty sure you will be.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.480
I always liked Arkanoid Revenge of- Don't!

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.200
That was one of my favorites.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.200
I like those games as a kid a lot.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.120
I had my breakout going on back in the day.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.280
I was where you could give your paddle a gun.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.520
It's like Breakout with guns, that was awesome.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.280
By the way, the game also has like original type of games.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.620
There's a karate game, a safe cracking game, so it's not just retro classics.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:46.980
But mini game fun, because who doesn't love their mini games on the Wii?

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.760
That's what I live for on the Wii.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:55.000
Well, something very interesting that's going to be coming to arcades pretty soon.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.240
Capcom is actually doing an original 2D fighting game.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.200
It's going to be the first one that they've done in three years.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.200
It's coming soon.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.620
There's a new teaser page on Capcom Japan's site.

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:13.520
No word exactly on what it is, although it looks very promising seeing as some of the

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:20.340
shots we've seen so far of the Street Fighter 2 HD for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.340
Network and stuff.

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.120
Oh, it looks awesome.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.680
Do you really think they'd put out Street Fighter 4?

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.640
No, not for another five years.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.320
If Street Fighter 3 was any indication.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.120
I think we need another Marvel vs. Capcom.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.120
You know what we need?

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.120
We need a Cyberbot sequel, because Cyberbot is Capcom's number one fighting game.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.480
Interesting choice.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.600
To quote Puzzle Fighter anyway.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600
Let's see.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600
You could have...

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.320
It's the game that gave us Devilot and Super 8.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:49.160
Capcom and SNK vs. Marvel and I don't know, your mom.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.160
Arcades vs. comics.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160
There you go.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.880
It'll be like arcade fighting games vs. comic characters.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.640
We just need a new Cyberbot.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.600
We need a new Cyberbot, because Cyberbot is still...

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600
And we...

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.600
And another Red Earth.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.880
How about another Darkstalkers game?

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.760
That would be cool.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.760
No.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.760
How about no?

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.760
I don't know.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760
It's all about dude who played with his blood.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.760
That'd be cool.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760
Go get a...

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.960
Going to chatroomchat.orangelandtrader.com, Rob D. says, new Capcom 2D fighter?

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960
I'm in.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960
No questions asked.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.960
Let's see.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:26.560
Shadow Charlie says, quote, butt fucking yeah, another Cyberbot.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.560
Hell yeah.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.080
What they need to do is they need to get like, you know how they have the Triforce thing

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:36.320
for, you know, the F-Zero stuff, where it's Sega and, you know, Namco and Nintendo.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:43.160
They need to do something like that for fighting games, SNK, Capcom, and maybe Sega, I guess.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:48.200
And do like some sort of all-encompassing thing that has a lot of characters from all

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.200
these different games.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.760
You know, you think all those brilliant minds put together could like, I don't know, save

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.760
arcades?

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760
No.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.760
You think?

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.760
I don't know.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.760
Maybe they don't want to.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.760
Well, I mean, look at MUGEN.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.640
I mean, that's the way to go.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.040
Billions of fighters all fighting each other.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.040
That should be the name of the game.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.280
MUGEN is freaking awesome.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280
There it is.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.280
There's the name of the game right there.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.160
Billions of fighters all fighting each other.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160
That's it, right?

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.160
Super happy.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.160
Yeah.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.200
Because, you know, that's fighting orgy.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.800
You know what game, though, that I really want a new version of?

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.880
Not orgy.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.320
No.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.520
I want a new Rival Schools.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:35.400
I played the crap out of the first one, out of the Evolution one.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.200
I paid 90 bucks for the Evolution one.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.320
Well, no, there was a rumor about the Apollo Justice game or whatever that was subtitled

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.840
and people are thinking it's either a new Phoenix Wright game or a new Rival Schools

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.840
game.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.840
So.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.840
You know what?

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:53.840
MUGEN makes this joke in chat, the Super Ultimate Extreme Fighting Combat Tournament, and that

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.160
makes me think, oh my god, why doesn't Capcom and Midway just get together, give the fans

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.360
what they want?

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.720
Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.720
Come on.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.720
That would be hot.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.000
That would be hot.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
It wouldn't work.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.120
They would have to use, like, this really shitball Street Fighter game.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120
Actually, no.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.120
And Mortal Kombat.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.120
Actually, no.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.760
They could take the Mortal Kombat characters and make them all cool, cell, you know, shaded

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.760
and stuff.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.280
The ones that are all 3D, they could use the Street Fighter EX.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.840
Now I do realize this means Capcom and Midway have to get together, which I don't think

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.960
anybody ever thinks would happen, but.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.960
Why not?

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.960
I would say that would be pretty cool.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.960
And there you go.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.720
Midway, SNK, and Capcom.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.000
And I would say instead of going, you know, with the live, you know, the Mortal Kombat's

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.800
been out of arcades for how long now?

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.800
For a long time.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.640
And this way you could take, you know, the characters from Mortal Kombat and actually

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:45.040
draw them all cell shaded and stuff and it would look pretty awesome.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.400
But they would never do that because it would be awesome and make sense.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.400
Ross Steele, UT, says Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat wouldn't work.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.560
The games are too different.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:58.260
I don't know though, but they made, I mean, they made Capcom fight comic book characters

01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.360
and that somehow worked.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:05.560
I mean, and, you know, Marvel versus Capcom versus SNK, you know, and it could, I mean,

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.080
I understand because there's a lot of weaponry that goes into Mortal Kombat and it's a much

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.080
darker game.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:16.600
Yes, it's a total fanboy thing I'm going off on here with, but come on and indulge me for

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.600
just like five seconds.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.760
It might be a fun game.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:25.200
Well, if you don't mind me going to a previous topic, by the way, the Ragnarok Online DS

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.440
is not actually online.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.680
They just have multiplayer elements over Wi-Fi.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.840
I'm going to refrain from making the obvious joke here about Nintendo because I'm irritating

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.120
some folks in chat, although they can kiss my big fat butt.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.800
They should just do it on Wii, but instead of your little Ragnarok characters, you have

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.800
your Miis.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.200
No, that might be cute.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.200
You have, like, Ragnar-Me.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.040
Ragnar-Me?

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.040
You're weird.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.560
All right, enough of this whole fighting game talk.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.040
Somebody please bring up another topic.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.720
Well, anyone who's a fan of Valkyrie Profile will be happy that Valkyrie Profile 2 has

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.060
a date.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:11.800
It will be out on the 7th of September.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.600
Yay!

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:21.240
So this one has got a different story.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:28.000
There's going to be the youngest of three Valkyries is booted out of heaven and has

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
to go do shit.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.280
That would suck to get booted out of heaven, actually.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.360
So this is one of those series I've wanted to play but haven't gotten a chance to check

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.360
out.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.840
Well, seeing as how if you're a Valkyrie you have to fight all the time and then think

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.800
people to die, so I think being booted out of heaven might not be so bad.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.160
The only other game with a Valkyrie I can think of is Gauntlet because I always used

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.760
to play Blue Valkyrie.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.960
Or Macross.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.960
Blue Valkyrie.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.680
Yeah, but that's a different kind of Valkyrie, duh.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.960
I like that Valkyrie a lot better.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:02.200
Dude, I wouldn't mind having the one where you use your brain, like in Macross Plus.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.080
The YF-21.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.080
That was it.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.080
Anyway.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.080
Uh, you know, a lot of folks in chat, going back to the fighting game topic for a moment,

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.280
now they're getting all Killer Instinct on it.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.640
They're like, who owns Killer Instinct now?

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.640
I do.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:16.640
Who cares?

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.640
Killer Instinct sucked.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.640
It was kind of fun.

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.640
I liked it.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.640
Boo!

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.640
Boo yourself.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.640
I actually have both of them.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.800
I have the one on Nintendo 64 and, okay.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.720
I forgot they had it on 64.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.440
Yeah, they did KI 2 Gold.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440
That's right.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440
Good times.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.440
And I remember, this was before I moved out here.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:36.440
I had Dan play the game over and over and over again just to rip me orchid's music.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.880
SSJ100Matt says, Rare says they have no intention of doing a new Killer Instinct.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.880
DIAF Rare.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:47.880
You know, I played a Rare, actually I did play a Rare game at the party.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880
Pinbot.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.480
Rare published Pinbot for the Nintendo.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.480
That's true.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.560
But thank God, though, they're going to be doing that Banjo Kazooie sequel.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560
Woo!

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.200
Cannot wait.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.880
That's going to be so awesome and totally won't suck.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.560
All right, look, let's change the topic completely here.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.480
One last topic for this part A, then we're going to go into a break and come back for

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.040
part B. Talking about the Simpsons game.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.400
You know, the Simpsons have a game coming out, you know, it's no coincidence there's

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.880
a movie and pretty soon there'll be a game.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.840
And this game is like a spoof of every other video game, yes?

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840
Yes.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.840
Yes.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.760
Well, the ultimate spoof waits for you at the very end of the game.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.040
The very last boss, the final boss in the Simpsons game is Matt Groening, the creator

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.800
of the Simpsons is who you will face at the very end of the game.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:34.800
Ooh, spoiler!

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.880
Yeah, sorry, OMG spoiler, but you know, come on, you don't play a Simpsons game for the

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880
plot.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880
You play it because it's funny.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.120
The game looks sexy, too, by the way.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:47.080
This is like EA's first Simpsons game.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.080
It looks awesome.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.080
Good.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.080
Well, props to EA.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.840
You know, sometimes we dog on that company a little bit on this show, but props to them

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.200
if they pull this off.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.480
Certainly not anything like Superman returns the game.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:03.240
This game, by the way, will be out this fall, so it's going to miss the movie, but probably

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.680
make it in time for the DVD release, yes?

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.960
That would be my guess.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.200
The Rob D says, you totally spoiled the Simpsons game I wasn't going to play.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.200
How could you?

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.120
SSJ100Matt says, still waiting on Simpsons arcade game on 360.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.640
You never know, the movie's around the corner.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.640
It could happen.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.640
It could happen.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.320
But, again, it's going to be like that whole, you know, Konami and Ubisoft had to kind of

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.520
team up to get us Ninja Turtles, so what, Konami and EA are going to have to team up

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.160
to get us Simpsons, right?

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.160
Could happen, though.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.160
Who knows?

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:38.320
You know, it could very well could be like Doom, where it's like, Doom, there it is.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.560
We didn't tell you about it, so there it is.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.480
That's exactly what Peter Moore said at the press conference, too, is it's like, Doom,

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.480
there it is.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.600
Yeah, we need a break.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.920
I know, that's how I feel, too.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.120
We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back with a little more of Orange Lounge

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.120
Radio.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.960
Hey, in part B tonight, listless.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:04.440
E3 is just around the corner, so we need to do an honorary E3 listless.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.360
If you haven't heard listless before, definitely stay tuned for part B. And we'll be back with

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.600
more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.980
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and it's podcast to the world twice

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:16.980

Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
