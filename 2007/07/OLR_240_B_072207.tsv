20137	21038	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
49639	50780	I will have to fight the cat to the death.
50800	51981	Or then we'll move it to your house.
53163	58908	No, because the room that the computer's in also has poor ventilation and a bunch of stuff in it.
59669	60009	Stuff.
60890	62392	We got a laser pointer for the cat.
63273	64754	You got a laser pointer for the cat?
65655	66576	Or to point at the cat?
66616	67397	To point at the cat.
67617	69639	Oh, I thought maybe you were going to strap a laser pointer onto the cat.
69659	70480	They have those.
71496	73457	So you can get a cat with a freaking laser on it.
73497	74578	That's dangerous.
74598	76319	You get a cat with a freaking laser on its head.
76599	78360	Alright, come on, let's get back to the gaming news.
78900	80281	Somebody, quick, start us off.
80682	80922	Anyways.
81182	81922	Pac-Man.
82943	83603	No Pac-Man.
85645	89647	So yeah, it's kind of interesting, you know, with the whole announcement with the Wii Fit board.
89687	91548	We kind of talked about this a little bit last week.
92128	96151	Possible other usage for the board, actually, like in, you know,
96753	99395	How exactly would you use weight and balance in an RPG?
99435	100476	I have no idea.
124246	127487	Maybe the longer you stand on one foot, the more health you have.
127547	129668	As soon as you fall, oh, zero.
129788	131128	Maybe dodging or something.
131268	131648	I don't know.
131728	133449	I don't see anything like that.
134249	139311	I think it would be good for just like sports games, like the next SSX game or whatever.
139351	141552	Just have that as an optional control method.
142312	145153	Or what we all need, a jump roping game.
146735	148096	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
167305	168607	I've never done that before.
168707	170769	It's totally by the people that do Flamin' Fingers.
170789	172290	No, then it has to be good.
172711	173992	It's the same soundtrack?
174012	174793	Similar, similar stuff.
174913	177255	Oh my god, I love Flamin' Fingers' soundtrack.
177315	178176	It's so good.
179537	180198	Anyway, hold on.
180358	186324	Jumpin' Jackpot is not a role-playing game, so I'm trying to figure out how this could tie into a role-playing game.
186684	187485	It just doesn't make sense.
187845	190528	It could be for your character walking around.
191028	191749	I would assume it would be.
192301	215839	But I don't want to stand when I play a game like Final Fantasy Final Fantasy is a game for me to sit on my big butt on the couch and play Maybe you could sit on the Wii Fit board and lean back and forth Now that I could do Plant the Wii Fit board firmly under your large ass Lean left to cast black magic Lean right to cast white magic I don't know, silly
216772	218113	Project Hammer Project Hammer Project Hammer
236530	244113	And there was a spokesperson that was actually at E3 that said, Disaster is still under development, speaking about Disaster Day of Crisis.
244453	246754	We've shifted development resources from Project Hammer.
247034	249735	You may hear about it in the future, but it's off the schedule for now.
250015	254477	And then there was a report on Digg today that said that Project Hammer was gone.
254817	258799	And I couldn't tell if it was a misinterpretation of the story or what was going on.
259019	260620	Have you heard anything about Project Hammer, Loki?
260640	263841	No, but it's impossible that they misinterpreted the story because I heard...
264301	267922	There was one also about that Wii Fit board story.
268122	273903	They were saying, oh my god, they're going to make Final Fantasy Fit, you know, like an exercise game.
273943	280144	But they were being sarcastic in the interview because they're like, are you guys going to make a Final Fantasy, you know, health fitness game?
280724	286366	They're all, no, but we more likely use it for an upcoming RPG or something.
286386	289266	Then maybe after that, then we'll work on Final Fantasy Fitness.
289426	293067	Being sarcastic and people took it as like, oh my god, they're working on Final Fantasy Fitness, you know.
293927	295028	No, it's sarcasm.
295989	296729	Look it up, people.
297149	297990	What's sarcasm?
299151	299771	I don't know.
299891	300552	What is it?
304854	306496	How about some other stuff?
306736	307536	Alright, other stuff.
308877	314661	Well, for those who are keeping track of the numbers, well, the Wii is about ready to kick the...
315202	317344	Pants off of the Xbox 360.
317924	324169	As far as sales go worldwide, Xbox 360 has sold 10.08 million units.
324569	329573	The Wii is at 9.05 million and PS3 is at 3.63 million.
329993	336218	I think it's great that the Wii is just a million short of the Xbox 360 for having been out for a shorter amount of time.
336999	340201	As far as the DS, it's 44.97 million units versus the PSP's 22.15 million.
345456	348898	I wouldn't have thought there's more PSPs out there than Xbox 360s, though.
348918	350599	But then again, the PSP's been out a long time.
351620	354421	Well, more people are going to want to go for the handhelds anyway.
354461	355342	That also makes sense.
356322	361185	I guess I forget about families and stuff where every kid has to have their own DS or their own PSP or whatever it is.
361365	364807	Mommy, he won't give me my game!
365428	365728	That.
366268	366849	Yes, that.
367089	367729	Exactly that.
367769	368930	Hence why I don't breed!
373075	377419	Well, do you think that the Wii is going to overtake the 360 very soon?
377580	377780	Yes.
379321	380102	It's already proven.
380723	381283	It all depends.
381904	385467	They probably will, just because they keep selling at a consistent rate.
386008	394517	But at the same time, we don't know what Microsoft has up their sleeves, and obviously they're not just going to let them take the top spot.
395313	402157	If you look at it this way, the Xbox 360, as I'm aware, should already be on a slight decline ever since it reached the peak.
403277	407539	Unless, of course, they come out, because I don't really think that the new units are going to be much of a reason to go buy a new one.
408440	413042	But the Wii, however, it's really, really sort of a wildfire kind of thing.
413122	415424	The more people that are getting it, the more they're telling other people.
415784	418045	And it really appeals to a much broader demographic, so...
418874	423156	Well, Microsoft does have Halo 3 in the wings, and that's going to be... Yeah, yeah, yeah, next.
423176	427018	All right, well, now some comments from our chat room, chat.orangehoundradio.com.
427038	428539	We love having the folks talking here.
429440	431841	Dr. Foev says, that's not fair.
432401	434743	If the 360 and PlayStation 3 was $249, it would destroy the Wii's numbers.
438484	439064	DarkSakura.com
458286	459446	There's a ton of good games.
482443	484544	But most of them are like mini-games.
484784	485744	A lot, a lot, a lot.
486124	487965	No, there's actual games.
488385	490005	Like maybe Trauma Center.
490645	494147	But there's not a lot of long-lasting type games.
494227	496007	Even Cook and Mama lost its thrill for me.
496027	497267	It was more of a DS game for me.
497287	498128	By the way, I need to borrow that.
499988	500308	There it is.
501389	501669	Anyways.
502731	507535	Well, PlayStation 3 may be dead last in the whole thing, but at least they have something to brag about.
507795	515801	And that would be that they're selling twice as many PlayStation 3s in Japan than they are Xbox 360s.
517242	523287	Of course, they've reached their one million mark in Japan, and Microsoft is still trailing behind.
524268	529412	But, you know, it's only going to get stronger, I guess, with releases from both companies.
529652	532434	It's going to actually be pretty good in Japan, I think.
533095	534756	See, there's Microsoft's real problem.
534856	540257	Because in that last story, we were looking at the worldwide numbers where the Wii is starting to overtake the 360.
541198	548420	Well, the reason why the 360 has not had a further gap on the Wii is because it's still not cracking the market in Japan.
549051	552793	which is interesting because they've had games like Blue Dragon now for a little bit.
553273	554654	Did Eternal Sonata come out there finally?
554674	555134	I think it did.
555595	557095	Or Trusty Bell or whatever it's called.
557355	560417	You know, these games are not moving as many units as folks thought it would.
560477	565340	So I think that's the 360's biggest problem when you're going to look at the worldwide numbers is that they still cannot crack Japan.
565400	568962	Well, they have 2.5 million Wii's in Japan as well.
569102	574565	So, you know, whereas they may be outselling the 360, they're still not number one.
574885	575045	But...
576294	585632	I don't know, Japan is an important market, it's not the largest market though, and if they're looking for numbers, I mean, I still think they need to focus, I guess, on the U.S.
586794	587095	and the U.K.
588004	588705	Well, who knows?
588825	592107	Maybe these will help move some Xboxes, but probably not.
592727	604576	Some new demos are out on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and the demos are for Juiced 2, because you know the Japanese love their Juiced, and FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, because I think that's big over there in Tokyo as well.
604956	612221	It's going to be in the UK, actually, the FlatOut one, which reminds me, I need to get a UK account so I can download that, because I love me some FlatOut.
612651	613732	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
641824	645406	But if you crash, you can eject your driver through the windshield.
645426	646967	Ooh, I might have to try this.
647887	649248	Okay, I will download this demo.
650009	651549	I like the idea of an eject button.
652310	655352	Well, speaking of eject... Wait, real quick, sorry, Jamie.
655672	657553	But here's the best part about it, Rob.
657753	666258	They have a whole set of minigames based around ejecting the driver out, including basketball, bowling, high jump, all sorts of things.
666518	668639	Can I eject him into a wall of pillows?
670005	670565	Amazing.
670605	671946	How about a stack of Twinkies?
674247	676407	Instead of a cream filling, it's a blood filling.
677047	677648	Whatever.
678588	683589	Well, Xbox, poor, poor Microsoft.
684590	692812	At the report for the end of their fiscal year for June 30th, they reported a $1.9 billion loss.
694713	698154	$1.2 billion was from the fourth quarter when they said,
698584	699485	Hey, guess what?
699525	701548	The Red Ring of Death are bad.
704952	709257	However, they're expecting to hopefully redeem themselves soon?
709277	710418	I don't know.
710799	711279	We'll see.
714223	715605	Maybe they'll drop the price for real?
717063	718665	I think that's what's coming.
718705	723531	And I think when we talk about that whole sales thing earlier, I think a price drop is coming definitely before Christmas.
723571	724532	Probably about the time Halo 3 is.
724552	727156	They're going to bank way too much on Halo 3 pulling in money.
727196	728978	And the sad thing is that I think they will.
729688	733491	I know, I'm like, it's actually probably what's best for them.
733511	745939	But they're not just banking on Halo 3, there's, you know, Halo 3, Project Arthur Racing 4, Mass Effect, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4, all those big titles that are... Eternal Sonata is like the game I'm most excited about, sadly, out of everything.
745959	750442	There's a huge lineup, it's not all just, they're not all banking just on Halo 3.
750502	751362	Carcassonne 2?
753804	758227	But, I mean, Sony's doing the same thing, they've got, you know, a pretty good lineup for the fall, just...
759063	760224	There isn't as much.
762665	763286	Hopefully it'll get better.
763966	767308	Well, how does this whole Red Rings thing ultimately impact Microsoft?
769190	770510	Well, it's already impacted them.
771551	774353	They're having to extend all those warranties on top of it, you know.
774833	776534	Yeah, they're going to have to sell millions more systems.
776554	777555	That's money out of their pocket.
778355	779936	Well, it's not getting any better for them.
780037	781938	Should have done it right the first time, hi!
782038	783359	They're going to green light Halo 4 now.
784474	790898	They're facing a second class action lawsuit regarding the scratched disc issue.
791799	795981	And really, you know, they are to blame for this.
796061	797542	I mean, it's such a simple fix.
798343	804306	The issue comes from people jiggling the Xbox 360 while the disc is spinning, causing the...
805888	809990	Actual laser to scratch a nice little ring into the disc.
810250	813752	Why would you pick up your Xbox 360 and shake it while the disc is moving?
814092	814552	Here's why.
814752	815733	Maybe because it's a baby.
816873	817194	No.
820115	830020	A lot of people are fascinated by... There's a little mercury switch in there that when you tilt your 360, whether it's upright or laying flat, the ring's always...
831332	831872	and DarkSakura.com
861761	864362	And that would have been... Or just not shaking your Xbox 360.
864443	864943	Exactly.
865083	866444	To watch the light tip up and down.
866464	868085	Or take the disc out, if you're going to do that.
868165	872487	Or even better, just, you know... I don't know, don't be retarded with it.
874608	875849	And yeah, the chatroom agrees.
875929	881072	Over at chat.orange.com, Blaze says, Well, people shouldn't be dumb shits and do stupid things like that.
881632	884774	And Son of Dad thinks it happens because there's candy inside.
885354	886715	It's like a pinata, you shake it.
886795	888396	Viva pinata, I get it.
890100	892021	You're especially funny tonight, Miklatov.
892081	894523	I'm always funny when I talk.
896625	902629	Blaze says, I've had my 360 get knocked over on me.
902749	905651	It looked like a stapler got shot into the disc 20 times.
906832	910075	I thought when I first read that, I thought he said that's what he did to the person that knocked it over.
910115	911756	He shot a stapler into him 20 times.
911816	912676	I'm thinking that would hurt.
912837	914578	That reminds me of that scene in UHF.
916309	917609	or he shoots him with a staple gun.
918310	919070	See, that's the thing, though.
919370	923891	I don't understand how... Okay, granted, it should have been fixed.
924132	928033	The foam in there couldn't have cost less than a dollar.
928413	929693	I mean, to fix this thing.
929713	932214	That's a whole dollar.
932994	934635	It's less than a dollar, okay?
935455	936556	I mean, to fix this.
937356	940517	I don't know why they didn't, but for whatever reason, they didn't.
940817	943958	Either way, though, still, I mean...
944924	946145	Don't jiggle the machine.
946205	947646	It says in the manual not to do it.
947906	956333	But then again, the Wii manual says not to throw it through your TV, and people do that anyway, so... I guess, you know... And then they want to sue Nintendo.
956613	958935	The Wii broke my TV because it doesn't bounce.
960296	962338	I guess... You know, it's like...
963399	964380	I don't know what you gotta do.
964500	967462	Walk these people through how to handle their console.
967922	969403	Don't shake the console.
969443	970504	It doesn't like it.
970844	971805	It will scratch your disc.
972025	977348	Have you ever seen those posters like downtown when you're driving or whatever that says, don't shake your baby?
977488	981231	A message from the... Actually, the headquarters for that is right by where I work.
981531	988616	And after talking with some of those people, no, because the whole thing started because a nanny shaked this...
989718	990940	and DarkSakura.
1003297	1007361	You're dealing with somebody who is not fully developed.
1007401	1008422	Why would you shake them?
1008702	1012046	Well, the Xbox 360 is not fully developed either.
1012466	1013227	So don't shake it.
1013687	1017171	I want to work for that company and work in their product test support.
1019373	1025159	And see if one day they make a model of a baby that can be shaken.
1030037	1030878	Oh wait, turn off my mic.
1030998	1031738	Heart babies.
1032278	1033019	Love babies.
1033959	1035160	I like them when they're quiet.
1035500	1037221	I like them with a straw in their head.
1038262	1038882	To drink.
1039543	1040503	Okay, so anyways.
1040583	1042144	What is wrong with you?
1043105	1043785	So real quick.
1043805	1044686	Seriously!
1045666	1046506	Video games, Rob.
1046526	1047787	Back to video games.
1047947	1050007	Is video games what caused you to be so violent?
1050087	1053909	I would, however, like to encourage our listeners to go to DontShakeYourBaby.com.
1054749	1057010	And just don't shake babies.
1057490	1059210	And don't shake Xbox 360s.
1059531	1062872	And while you're at it, just don't shake people or things in general.
1063272	1065593	Unless they're stupid and then throttle them.
1065733	1070034	Or unless it's a can of Coke that you're about to hand to your friend to watch them open.
1070134	1070974	That is funny.
1070994	1071975	You can shake your booty.
1071995	1072375	That's funny.
1073635	1075757	Watch me shake my ass right now!
1075837	1077958	Right in front of my face, no thank you.
1078518	1091205	The plaintiff, I guess, to this whole case, Christine Moskowitz, she says she was displeased when the Xbox 360 she purchased for her son wrecked copies of Gears of War, Crackdown, and Saints Row.
1091705	1098389	A second plaintiff, Dan Wood, claimed that his system ruined a Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell disc.
1099471	1100172	Thank you for watching!
1118061	1123647	I'm sorry, there's no... Once you learn, hmm, shaking it broke one of my games.
1123967	1125649	Maybe I shouldn't do that.
1126210	1127812	What's that grinding noise?
1128272	1130595	Instead, he's like, hmm, I'll put a different disc in there.
1130795	1132397	Hmm, it makes the noise again.
1133898	1135880	Oh, better sue them, because we're out $150.
1135920	1136241	Boo fucking hoo.
1141164	1144585	I think this calls for an Orange Lounge Radio public service announcement.
1144685	1148867	So if we may, let's bring on an Orange Lounge Radio public service announcement.
1150448	1151288	Camera, please.
1151988	1152549	All right, thank you.
1152589	1159411	Ready, lights, camera, and action.
1161812	1169676	Hi, this is Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you not to shake your Xbox 360.
1171286	1176548	because if you do, then you deserve to have your $60 games broke down on you.
1177449	1179250	Also, please don't shake children.
1180330	1181791	That was the worst public service announcement ever.
1185572	1186653	Can we get back into the stories, please?
1187653	1187894	No.
1187914	1190255	Well, the next story is mine.
1190535	1191055	Okay, fine.
1192199	1194780	Metal Gear Solid 4 on the Xbox 360
1208848	1211529	Did they just not have E3 happen?
1212049	1216751	And did they not just reconfirm that the game is going to be a PS3 exclusive and all this blah blah blah?
1217071	1225394	Well, the official Xbox magazine comes out and says that it's going to be coming to the Xbox 360 a few months after the PlayStation 3 version.
1226194	1233916	And this is just after Kazumi Kitawa said at E3, since Metal Gear Solid was born for the PlayStation, we'd like to keep it as a PlayStation game.
1234276	1235897	But we might have to take some steps.
1237643	1241366	And that's the whole reason why people are thinking, again, it's coming to the Xbox 360.
1241847	1243188	I'm just thinking, let it go!
1244048	1244649	Let it go!
1244809	1245810	Here's the other thing, though.
1245850	1260061	I mean, to argue for it coming to the 360, hasn't everything that Sony's basically told... I know this is not Sony, but they're speaking for the Sony platform, I guess.
1260882	1264965	Hasn't everything that they've denied come true anyways?
1265226	1265486	I mean...
1266107	1278825	And granted, they probably don't want to make an announcement that it's actually coming out for Xbox 360 because then that pretty much shoots their chance for an actual, you know, really good exclusive game coming to their platform.
1279927	1280207	I don't know.
1282134	1286135	I'm just bothered by the fact that they can't get away from this.
1286195	1288856	And this comes up like a week after E3.
1288876	1292537	When they got up there and reaffirmed it's coming out for PlayStation 3 only.
1292997	1298819	If they do have plans for the Xbox 360, it's going to be a huge time difference in the releases.
1299219	1304300	Because I don't think they'll bring it out until the PlayStation 3 has proved it can't sell the copies that Konami wants it to sell.
1305074	1307395	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1329635	1334760	4-5 times across the scope of a couple months just because some stupid rumor ignites all the blogs around the world.
1335180	1336061	I get angsty.
1336461	1341265	I don't know about the rest of you, but it seems like no better time to bring out the FUs of the week.
1351254	1353236	Jamie, start us off, please, with the FUs of the week.
1353456	1355818	I actually have a two-part one because one's related to the other.
1356641	1360062	First of all, I'd like to say F you to laminate flooring.
1360982	1363082	Because, okay, this is how I burnt my ribs, okay?
1364302	1367143	I just got back from the gym and I stepped into the tub.
1367243	1369383	I did not even sit down, I just stepped into the tub.
1369963	1373044	And my phone rang, so I stepped out, dried off my feet.
1373184	1374664	I made sure to dry off my feet.
1375224	1377225	Stepped into the hallway and down I went.
1378185	1384046	And I fell sort of skewed with my elbow into my side and I banged my knee really hard and I felt that all I hurt was my knee.
1384984	1391728	The next morning I woke up and my ribs were blue, and I hurt quite a bit, so I went to the doctor that day and he put me on a lot of Vicodin.
1392529	1395411	So, um, and I'm fully functional on Vicodin.
1395491	1409719	You know, I can go to my job and do my work, and I'm fine as long as I'm focused on one thing, you know, but when I take it, I can't really do... I'm not the multitasker I normally am, and Rob, you know how I do 50 million things at once.
1410520	1412421	I can't really pay attention to that many things.
1413101	1413722	So, um...
1414520	1415461	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1444682	1445423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1469600	1475404	But it's, I was like, dude, if I wasn't, I wasn't offended, and I was offended now, you know what I mean?
1476124	1482548	It's like, first of all, everybody, when you're dealing with people, don't fucking make assumptions about how they feel.
1482828	1485050	Ask them first, how do you feel?
1485670	1491474	All you're gonna do is piss them off and, you know, cause drama that doesn't need to be caused.
1491494	1496097	You need to not, people need to not be afraid to ask someone how they feel.
1497330	1525815	don't make assumptions all it does is make an ass out of you and only you okay you know I think that it's just this whole oh I don't want to offend people and I don't want to well then fucking ask you know what's the worst thing they're gonna say oh you know I don't feel all that great about it right now and if they don't want to talk about it they'll fucking tell you I don't want to talk about it right now and respect it you know don't just assume because then I've been you know pissed off now for three days over this
1526876	1530659	And, you know, I'm a good person.
1530679	1531860	I think I'm a good person.
1531880	1534362	You know, don't you think I'm a good person?
1534522	1535002	Yeah, okay.
1536723	1546530	But I just think that, you know, instead of worrying about, you know, kid gloves and stepping on toes, if you don't want to step on toes, ask them where their toes are so that you don't step on them.
1546550	1550693	That's what I think.
1550773	1551014	Good?
1552014	1552535	All finished?
1553135	1555477	I think that I was fairly, uh...
1556545	1556645	F.U.
1556665	1557926	to Paper Mario Sucking My F.U.
1558046	1559127	of the week goes to Shane
1577068	1577368	What?
1577408	1578489	Only in the beginning.
1578509	1579951	Only in the beginning.
1579971	1580551	Made sense.
1580571	1581152	Still does.
1581512	1582713	Um... I get... Whoa, I get F you, right?
1582733	1584175	F you... Oh crap, I had one.
1584195	1585256	Where did it go?
1597930	1599311	Okay, I have two FUs.
1599431	1601693	One I can remember, then I'll come up with the other one in a second.
1601753	1610160	I FU to Europe, or the UK or whatever, because they got that location test for the Silent Hill arcade game, and it looks really sweet, and I want to play it so bad.
1611961	1614803	And I'm not going to fly over there to play it, but maybe I will.
1615464	1615824	Someday.
1616405	1625132	And then FU to next, not this coming Tuesday, but next Tuesday, because it'll be the final day of the Konami San Francisco offices.
1626805	1628307	And that'll be the end of that.
1629608	1629928	Alright.
1631870	1632230	Okay.
1633411	1633932	That's that.
1634232	1635473	All done with the FUs of the week.
1636474	1639377	Let's move on and back into the gaming news then.
1640638	1640818	Well...
1641624	1644286	And this makes me kind of laugh because it's kind of a stupid name.
1644687	1651653	But there's a new princess for Super Mario Galaxies that they have seen in Famitsu scans named Rosetta.
1652614	1656457	And I think Stone instantly because you know the Rosetta Stone was a big translator thing.
1658138	1664604	So she gets to hang out with Daisy and Peach and what's-her-face who wasn't even a princess from the first game.
1664664	1665244	Pauline.
1665985	1666866	She wasn't a princess.
1666926	1669228	She was just some hoochie from New York.
1670359	1671800	So she doesn't need to be with the princesses.
1671820	1674742	She's not good enough to be a princess.
1674842	1675542	She's just a hooker.
1676903	1679825	Polly wasn't in the Super Mario Bros.
1680005	1680625	movie, was she?
1681145	1681666	I don't think so.
1681726	1683527	She was in Mario Bros.
1683607	1684067	First Love.
1685348	1687709	And that's when he found out that Peach would put out, I guess.
1687789	1688110	I don't know.
1688810	1692852	But she's, I guess, pretty.
1693793	1696074	If you like, you know, dumb blondes, I guess.
1696494	1697375	No, I don't know.
1698776	1698956	Well...
1700236	1701616	Fear not, folks.
1701656	1712800	We talked a little bit about the Wii balance board in Part A, but Nintendo has come out to promise that they will be making more balance board-based games.
1713620	1716581	So you're not going to be buying this thing for only one game.
1717602	1718582	Hooray!
1720962	1721983	What else are they developing?
1722003	1722763	Have they said anything?
1723244	1724544	No, they did not.
1725185	1727446	They just said, yeah, we're working on stuff.
1727607	1732990	Gee, could it possibly be, I don't know, another game that involves a lot of minigames?
1733551	1737153	Possibly, and I'm going to guess the next WarioWare game.
1738034	1739174	Oh, God, probably.
1739595	1740255	That would make sense.
1741676	1742456	That might be fun, though.
1742497	1744658	I did like WarioWare on the Wii, I'll give you that.
1745385	1747906	A new audience can now experience a game that is beautifully designed and impossible to put down.
1770698	1778622	Rockstar Table Tennis was kind of one of those early hits on the Xbox 360, one of the earlier games I enjoyed, but it would be interesting to see how the game mechanics are going to change on the Wii.
1778943	1788528	As long as they had the nunchuck part actually move you, and the Wiimote be your weather paddle, is that what it's called?
1788648	1788808	Yeah.
1788948	1791049	Then I don't see any problem with it, it should be actually pretty fun.
1791089	1799674	I wonder how that's going to work with the different spins that you put on your ball, because that was a big part of the game, was that you had to look at the tiny little, the ball that was coming at you, and like the tiny color that surrounded it, so you could tell what's...
1800274	1800914	Outro Music
1815950	1816670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1844685	1846446	I can watch YouTube So guess what?
1846466	1846546	What?
1873979	1877101	Atari likes horses and people who love horses.
1877821	1886966	They're coming out with a game called My Horse and Me for Wii, DS, and PC that, from what I can understand, it's a horse raising and riding simulation.
1889188	1889468	Yeah.
1890008	1891669	Ride them horses, huh?
1893110	1893370	Well...
1894039	1905984	They're basically, and there's a quote on here saying, we're looking forward to providing the horse enthusiast community with a rich and authentic game that allows gamers to take care of and complete a variety of challenges with their horse.
1906264	1910866	Is there a big cross-section of the population that are horse enthusiasts and video game players?
1911546	1913607	I know, but they're the same type that play video games?
1913707	1920249	I know a person who's a horse enthusiast who loves video games, and she likes playing Guitar Hero Drunk.
1920809	1920909	One.
1921450	1922030	So you know one.
1922637	1931680	Out of all the horse games out there, you should consider this one because the game features the most accurate horse models and animations yet realized in a video game.
1931860	1932860	I think I would play it.
1933340	1934661	Take that, Final Furlong.
1935321	1936501	You know what I say to this game?
1937422	1937882	Nay.
1937902	1940623	I think I'm going to get the game.
1941543	1942283	I really think I'll play it.
1942343	1943063	Well, have fun.
1943944	1945364	Can you whip the horse with a Wiimote?
1945384	1946444	That might make me change my mind.
1946564	1947425	That might be kind of fun.
1947625	1951686	And then I can name the horse Britney Spears and I can whip Britney Spears just like it was Derby Owners Club.
1952429	1953569	I love Tribuners Club, okay?
1953609	1954069	I know you do.
1955610	1956010	There you go.
1956570	1960691	TheRobD says, you know, I've always been begging the video game industry for accurate horse physics.
1960771	1961711	I'm glad they listened.
1962971	1966072	I have a feeling that might be some of that sarcasm thing somebody was talking about earlier.
1966132	1966472	I don't know.
1967212	1967932	Possibly.
1968872	1973233	Anyways, another game coming out by Take-Two and Rockstar.
1973813	1977094	Bully, the scholarship edition, is now coming to the Xbox 360 and the Wii.
1978647	1985930	So, you know, you thought before that you may be able to get your, you know, Grand Theft Auto on on the Wii with Manhunt 2.
1987170	1992792	Hopefully, you'll be able to get your Bully on, I guess, with the Wii sooner than that.
1993053	1994913	But, I don't know.
1995033	1996394	It got a teen rating before.
1996514	1999575	I don't see why it would get any more than a teen rating now.
2000095	2001556	I'm looking forward to maybe picking this up on the 360.
2003086	2009407	Yeah, I'm kind of glad I missed it the last round on the PlayStation 2 because I was so immersed in my 360 at that time.
2010047	2015349	I'm kind of glad they are going to put it on 360 after all so I can play it in high def and widescreen and all that good stuff.
2015709	2018809	And I believe it will have new content as well for it.
2019570	2020770	More guys to make out with?
2022030	2023610	Yes, more guys to make out with.
2023690	2024111	Hooray!
2024211	2025851	Imagine what you could do with the Wiimote.
2030271	2031512	I don't know, Miklatov, what?
2031732	2033173	You could write on the chalkboards.
2033713	2034374	Oh, okay.
2034794	2035194	I could.
2038236	2039317	What were you thinking?
2039417	2039937	I don't know.
2040177	2041458	That's why I had to ask.
2042879	2049903	Well, also coming out for the Xbox 360 is Guilty Gear 2 Overture.
2050503	2052104	But here's the interesting thing.
2052344	2054826	It's not supposed to be a fighting game.
2056522	2057503	Thank you for watching!
2082062	2082662	Soul is awesome.
2082722	2083662	I love SoulBadGuy.
2083682	2084323	SoulBadGuy is great.
2084363	2086663	And Soul's going to be in there with a newcomer named Sin.
2086923	2087984	Who looks like Kai.
2088864	2091105	I liked Eno.
2091825	2092965	I was a fan of Zappa.
2093365	2094106	Love Zappa.
2094206	2094886	And I love Faust.
2095386	2096686	Oh yeah, Faust, of course.
2096706	2097547	I like Venom too.
2097587	2102128	One of my old cosplays though, and I'm sad because this is before I lost all that weight, is I cosplayed Baiken.
2102888	2105389	Which Dan didn't like because it's like, you know, boob.
2106493	2109174	I found a Faust cosplayer that same year.
2109194	2110014	That's awesome.
2110054	2111575	Did he rape you with his scalpel?
2112195	2112995	Like in the game?
2113015	2116617	I actually did hit him with the claw by accident.
2118257	2121678	But I had to give the claw back to Evan because it was part of his toys.
2122419	2123139	I won't say anything else.
2126420	2127881	I'll tell you off of the show.
2128281	2129641	Okay, there you go then.
2133563	2134803	I'm glad you didn't say that on a mic.
2136443	2137323	Hey, is it my turn again?
2166670	2172734	and Forced and Iron Ox, at least what their names are in the U.S.
2173254	2175935	The game is supposed to hit arcades in Japan this winter.
2177877	2178837	I'm looking forward to that.
2178957	2180038	I know the series.
2182119	2185901	I'm surprised to see that they're actually making that into a fighting game, because I don't think there was that many characters.
2187062	2189823	But it can't be any worse than the actual Devil Kings game.
2191605	2195487	So yeah, there's this rumor going around before about Halo on the DS.
2196167	2203070	And it was interesting because I believe they did get Bungie's Brian Gerrard to comment on it.
2203610	2207552	Apparently, there is such a thing, I guess, in concept.
2207572	2216035	People have made, I guess, concept versions of the game to pitch to them, but nothing obviously has come out.
2216676	2219937	So they're saying Microsoft, of course, doesn't publish any DS games.
2220481	2221342	or license them.
2221362	2223405	I don't know.
2223425	2224366	Will it ever get created?
2225167	2225507	Who knows.
2225707	2232055	But, you know, argument's sake, there are a few different versions of Halo for the DS out there.
2233697	2235900	Like what is created as jokes or what?
2236180	2236961	No, like pitching.
2237161	2237582	Like, uh,
2238297	2240018	Hey, we want to bring Halo 2 to the DS.
2240058	2241079	Here's what we can do with it.
2241299	2242479	And then showing them off the game.
2242499	2243140	Well, what's the problem?
2243200	2246421	If Microsoft never plans to get into the handheld market, what's the problem?
2246441	2249823	There's 44 million DSs out there to sell product to.
2250103	2252885	Who says it won't happen at some point?
2253185	2253845	It'd be weird.
2253865	2255947	It'd be very weird.
2256127	2263951	I kind of think, though, a little bit like... I don't know if it's a good thing because, I mean, look at the last time they tried something like that with the Panasonic.
2264031	2265912	Or not the Panasonic, but the CD-i.
2267483	2269505	Remember the Mario and the... Oh, yes.
2270125	2271587	Wanda Gamelin and all that stuff.
2271747	2272167	All the games.
2273088	2276972	But, I mean, hey, I wish that that would kind of happen because that would be pretty awesome.
2276992	2286461	You know, have Nintendo developing games for the Xbox 360 that are a little bit higher end and then have Microsoft developing stuff for the DS.
2286481	2288283	That would be pretty cool.
2288543	2289003	Good stuff.
2289344	2289644	All right.
2290965	2299793	Well, moving back over to the Xbox 360, which of course is where the Halo series will soon show up, what's going on is that there is actually a new hack out there.
2300693	2311363	The Xbox hacker forums have stated that the Xbox 360's DVD key and game region code can now be altered to break down the region locks for some games.
2312343	2313645	Here's a quote from the person who did it.
2313745	2317628	I successfully changed the DVD key and region code of the 360, so it's all confirmed.
2318092	2324295	All I did towards this was to reverse the plain text KV signature to figure out how to modify and re-sign the KV contents.
2325135	2333478	But, okay, so, you know, hooray, now you might be able to reverse your 360 to play games from other regions, but Microsoft will probably close this loophole pretty soon.
2333518	2333838	They usually do.
2333858	2334699	I think they already have.
2334799	2339340	I think it's just on some of the older kernels that you can do that.
2340981	2343282	TheRobD says, oh, that's all he did?
2344022	2345483	I can't believe I didn't think of that.
2346291	2350493	I think that might be a little more of that sarcasm thing somebody was referring to earlier in the program.
2350633	2351053	I don't know.
2351773	2352073	Maybe.
2353494	2355594	Alright, and then ShadowCharlie says, Brick.
2356955	2358896	The Xbox 360 is going to be a brick pretty soon.
2359556	2362757	They should just have a code in there when you try to do something like that and hack it.
2362877	2365358	It'll just carve a nice little circle into your disc.
2366058	2372821	Like your Xbox 360 commits seppuku when it figures out that you're trying to, you know, taint it.
2375262	2375722	That'd be funny.
2377060	2380483	Far Cry 2 Far Cry 2 Far Cry 2 Far Cry 2
2407196	2407957	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2420217	2423060	I want to tie that game that could possibly be good.
2423080	2424941	I'm just theorizing, Jesus.
2424982	2430767	That's like if they would have promoted House of the Dead 3 in a House of the Dead the movie or something.
2431007	2431768	Should I tie that in?
2432128	2435191	Nobody would have played House of the Dead 3 at all.
2436172	2439915	No, I think, I don't know, it was a good first person shooter game.
2440535	2442818	I like how you can make your own levels and stuff in it.
2442938	2443658	That was kind of neat.
2444399	2446501	Just makes you miss time splitters even more.
2447074	2450977	So since Jamie and I both don't play Far Cry, you tell us, what would you want to see in Far Cry 2?
2451017	2454099	I don't know.
2454740	2460704	I would like to see some of the stuff that they're showing off in Crysis, because Crysis looks like such an amazing game.
2461325	2463586	And Far Cry was pretty good when it came out, originally.
2464227	2467109	Maybe some different settings, maybe not all in the jungle.
2468170	2471012	I don't know, just improve upon it.
2471072	2472693	I mean, it was a pretty good game to begin with.
2473774	2476336	Some of the AI, though, in the first game was a little weird.
2476897	2478178	So maybe tune that up a bit.
2478278	2485003	But if the AI is good and the game stays kind of how it was, it should be a pretty good game.
2486965	2492309	And if you don't have it on the 360, I'd recommend picking it up because it's dirt cheap now and it's actually pretty fun.
2493030	2493350	All right.
2494091	2494971	Well, let's move on.
2495251	2498274	Any more stories before we open up the Skype line, which I believe is coming up very soon?
2498374	2498594	Yes.
2499115	2499655	We got one.
2500182	2501202	And it's kind of interesting.
2501902	2506563	Silicon Knights, they're actually going to be suing Epic over the Unreal 3 engine.
2507064	2514385	Apparently, they've had some difficulties programming in it, and it's not performing as they had hoped.
2514905	2519626	And I guess this is kind of stemming from the showing of Too Human at E3.
2520627	2526928	Apparently, some people weren't too happy about it, but I don't know.
2527725	2530146	Should be interesting to see what's happening with it.
2531647	2534428	I know that they're not the only company it's been having trouble with.
2534508	2539791	I know for the PlayStation 3 side, Koei has been having trouble with Fatal Inertia.
2540531	2545174	In fact, that game has been postponed indefinitely now.
2546514	2551097	So some problems arising with this fantastic engine that everybody's been licensing.
2552437	2553458	Probably, yeah.
2554198	2555699	Is it just hard to work with?
2556755	2560618	They might just not have all of the documentation for it or something.
2560698	2562340	Sounds like they weren't getting everything they were promised.
2562680	2566603	Like there's going to be an update in six months and then it never came or whatever.
2567123	2572487	But it's hard to say until we get the smoking gun publishing the full court papers that we can read it for ourselves.
2572928	2573968	That'll be exciting.
2574069	2578112	DJ Janai in our chatroom says, Sue Epic for ditching One Must Fall 2097.
2578152	2581474	That's old school right there.
2583235	2583896	I love that game.
2584980	2588322	Hey, but there was the One Muff's Fall Battlegrounds that came out.
2588342	2589303	Remember online?
2589343	2590784	It was like a battle arena game.
2591845	2593686	So it's not over yet if you want to play that.
2594727	2595227	You never know.
2596078	2598638	Alright, anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line now.
2598678	2606260	If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
2606540	2607180	Who would have thought?
2607260	2609360	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype is our username.
2609841	2613961	And I also want to put out there that there is a brand new version of Skype available.
2614301	2617282	And this is our first night using it and they've changed the interface a little bit.
2617362	2622603	I don't anticipate any problems, but you never know what might go wrong here on the program.
2622623	2623463	So let's go to the phones.
2624861	2626082	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2626102	2626502	Who's this?
2627243	2628143	Raven's Dolphin.
2628203	2628744	How are you?
2628964	2633167	Good, and I'm so happy that the phone picked up this time and we're not having those technical difficulties.
2633207	2634247	What's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?
2635168	2635968	The epic thing?
2636008	2637509	A lot of things are on my mind, actually.
2637730	2638830	But the epic thing, really.
2640712	2641652	What about the epic thing?
2641692	2642413	The whole lawsuit?
2643193	2644694	Yeah.
2644754	2647256	Didn't Silicon Knights used to be like a Nintendo company?
2649057	2650058	Yes, according to Loki.
2651219	2651579	I don't know.
2651639	2653981	I haven't checked my Wikipedia.
2654061	2654541	Oh, is that it?
2654878	2656761	Yeah, Silicon Knights did Eternal Darkness.
2659065	2662050	Okay, so what does that have to do with your opinion on everything?
2663322	2666283	because, you know, now they're doing games for the 360 and PS3.
2666663	2679706	Do you find that a little, you know, like Nintendo cut them loose and now they're doing too human and then they try to get this engine and I feel, it feels like they're a bunch of, like, you know, how Epic has got this game that's really popular.
2679726	2681906	I feel like they're just trying to milk money out of them.
2682127	2685887	Like, a bunch of people go like, I can't get this to work, damn it, let's just sue them.
2686528	2692349	Well, that's, I mean, well, it's not just the sue part, but as far as the company making games for other companies, I mean, that's what you got to do to make money.
2692995	2698057	If you don't have an exclusive agreement with one anymore, you make games for wherever you think you can sell them.
2699177	2703919	Yeah, and you know, they're trying to make a whole new engine, so I wish them luck with that.
2704439	2706120	You're getting some agreement from our chat room.
2706400	2708741	Rob D says, I actually agree with Raven's Dolphin.
2709401	2711362	Like he's never agreed with you before, so there you go.
2712462	2713783	That's a first, that's a first.
2714183	2716424	And DJ Janai says, Epic has a big ego too.
2717691	2719713	They do, you know, but they do make good games.
2719753	2723817	But it feels like, you know, I'm playing Rainbow Six, which is an Unreal Tournament game.
2724077	2726139	I mean, an Unreal Technology game, and it works fine.
2726159	2727801	I don't know what they're doing.
2727861	2730603	Sephiroth1215 says, they weren't really a Nintendo developer.
2730643	2732705	They just made all the games on GameCube.
2733926	2734207	Okay.
2734487	2734687	All right.
2734807	2735568	Well, what else is on your mind?
2736667	2737728	What else is on my mind?
2738368	2739128	The Wii board.
2739429	2742770	You said that the Wii snowboard, not the snowboard, the Wii Fit board.
2743030	2743351	Fit board.
2743371	2745812	Could be used as the snowboard, I suppose, in a game.
2745852	2747313	Yeah, this is what I was thinking about.
2747373	2747653	Remember 1080?
2747713	2748233	Yeah.
2750354	2755557	Okay, wouldn't that be the hottest thing if they put 1080 on the Wii Fit board?
2756217	2758458	Or Tricky, SSX Tricky?
2759619	2761360	With that theme song I can never get out of my head.
2762480	2763041	It's Tricky!
2763081	2763241	Yeah.
2765492	2766152	I can't wait for that.
2766172	2767473	Blaze agrees with you in chat.
2767693	2768193	1080 for the win.
2769074	2772936	So you think they can do more types of games than just fitness games and mini games with this board?
2773396	2774816	I really do.
2775277	2779259	Like the next Tony Hawk and the 1080 game, I would cream my pants for that.
2779299	2780699	I'm a real snowboarding fan.
2780719	2783180	I don't like sports games, but I love snowboarding games.
2783481	2788823	How do you think they would do this whole Square Enix is saying they want to license the thing.
2789443	2792525	What kind of Square Enix game do you think would incorporate the Wii Fit boards?
2794050	2795011	I've been thinking about it.
2795251	2795711	I don't know.
2795751	2798413	It'll probably be a Final Fantasy kind of like rip-off game.
2798513	2798933	I don't know.
2798993	2803636	I don't think the kind of like Final Fantasy aerobic game going like, yeah, step on the board.
2803816	2804997	Yeah, cast a spell.
2805177	2806098	Yeah, do this.
2808559	2818045	Maybe it'll be Final Fantasy X-3 or something where, you know, the Yuna's angels, you know, you can actually do a little dance on the Wii Fit board and change into different outfits.
2818105	2818585	It'll be fun.
2818605	2819806	Doesn't that sound like fun?
2819826	2819886	Yep.
2820882	2821763	That does sound like fun.
2822143	2823384	But I'm really excited.
2823484	2825726	I'm not going to pass judgment on the board yet.
2826527	2827768	And you shouldn't until you get to play it.
2828108	2831271	Because a lot of people pass judgment on the Wii but change their minds when they actually get to play it.
2832252	2833013	Oh, one last thing.
2833053	2834634	You don't sound like Vodafone anymore.
2834954	2835355	Good for you.
2835415	2836235	I don't sound like what?
2837196	2839138	You don't sound like you're on Vonage at all.
2839714	2840835	It might be the new Skype.
2840855	2842576	I think the quality has increased slightly.
2843457	2844378	What's a VOG?
2845338	2846399	Why am I so loud?
2846439	2849301	A VOG is what a lady has between... I thought he said VOG.
2849361	2850542	I was like, what the crap?
2850582	2852464	It doesn't sound like you're on that, I guess.
2852864	2853324	Vonage.
2853665	2854185	Vonage.
2854205	2856967	No, a VOG is something completely different.
2857007	2858408	No, I had a D when I said it.
2858528	2859069	VOG.
2859169	2860790	A VOG is where the babies come from.
2861150	2861991	And then you shake them.
2862972	2863392	Stop it.
2864338	2867520	I gotta go, so you can pick up some more calls.
2867680	2870362	I think I made him uncomfortable.
2871803	2872644	I think you did.
2872864	2873745	That was fun.
2873765	2874465	Let's do it again.
2875726	2876086	Do it again?
2876126	2876787	Make him uncomfortable again?
2876807	2878128	I don't want to make somebody else uncomfortable.
2878448	2880029	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2880049	2880429	Who's this?
2881610	2882390	GS68.
2882831	2883731	Hi, GS68.
2883751	2884332	What's on your mind?
2885753	2891296	You know how you said Maximum 2 and 3 will come out along with Long and Midnight for the PS3, right?
2891477	2893498	I did, and I bet you're calling in to correct me, huh?
2894583	2895583	Uh, yeah.
2895863	2896463	Alright, what's up?
2896483	2900804	There's already a few Maximum 2 and 3 machines in Northern California.
2901724	2906165	Well, that's, but, okay, so it's not simultaneous, but it's been about the same time, right?
2906725	2908205	Yeah, there's already a machine in Hayward.
2908785	2909226	How is it?
2909266	2910066	I haven't played it yet.
2910106	2910546	Is it fun?
2910566	2912786	Uh, actually, I haven't tried it yet.
2913046	2916687	I'm just waiting for San Diego Golf Land and Milpitas Golf Land to get it.
2917447	2922968	Uh, so some of the local golf lands, sure, and, you know, it's a big chain, they get a lot of the hottest games, why not?
2923708	2923748	It,
2924042	2927206	Yeah, let me just post... I'm going to post a link in chat room, so... Alright.
2927346	2928287	Those people will know.
2928668	2929969	I am planning on buying it, though.
2930470	2931331	I think I've decided.
2931571	2932953	You think you are going to import it?
2932973	2939121	Yeah, because... Well, because I just, you know... I only have, like, one game for the PS3 now, and it'd be cool to have an import game.
2939141	2939962	Yeah, it might be fun.
2940643	2943405	Although it's not going to be fun if you buy the thing and then the damn thing doesn't work.
2943465	2944005	That's going to suck.
2944065	2944745	It's region free.
2945386	2946366	All the games are region free now.
2946386	2947147	Can I come over and play?
2947667	2948167	Yeah.
2948488	2949188	Tell him no.
2949588	2952970	GS68, do you know if the soundtrack on the third one is as cool as the second one?
2952990	2954311	Like, did Yuzo Koshiro do it again?
2954851	2962236	I don't know yet, but from what I've read, you can pick between the Maximum 2, 1 and 2 soundtrack and the new Maximum 2 and 3 soundtrack.
2962536	2962796	Huh.
2962896	2968059	And if you transfer a certain kind of card, you can get a special...
2969031	2972052	Soundtrack that's from an earlier Wongan Midnight game.
2972613	2973213	That's cool.
2973373	2975574	No, I just got disconnected from chat, so I missed your link.
2975634	2976194	Post it again.
2977135	2977775	Stupid chat.
2977795	2984018	Actually, someone just said that you have to register to see it.
2985218	2987019	It's one of those forums where you have to register to see it.
2987039	2989020	Give out your registration information.
2990260	2991321	Is it on BugMeNot?
2992401	2993802	Alright, no, it's fine.
2994218	2996360	I'll wait for the information to hit Wikipedia.
2996420	2996880	It's all good.
2997220	2998401	All right.
2998421	2999562	Well, thanks for the correction.
2999602	3000102	Appreciate it.
3000162	3001683	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3003024	3003585	No, I'm good.
3004085	3004405	All right.
3005386	3007287	Well, then we'll talk to you later, my friend.
3007307	3008068	All right.
3008128	3008508	Take care.
3008848	3009149	You too.
3010269	3010890	Bye-bye.
3012691	3012951	All right.
3013031	3013892	We'll go back to the phones.
3013912	3022338	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, and hopefully we can actually answer the calls tonight.
3022956	3026058	Again, we've upgraded to a new version of Skype and it's taking a little bit of getting used to.
3026078	3028279	I want these little floating windows to go away.
3028360	3028900	I don't like that.
3029700	3030421	Those need to go away.
3031301	3031762	Shake them.
3031782	3032462	Maybe it'll work.
3032682	3033022	Stop it.
3033923	3034784	Why am I so loud?
3034804	3035504	I don't know.
3035984	3036825	Oh, snap.
3037025	3037365	Hello.
3037465	3038026	Oh, snap.
3038286	3038586	Hi.
3038786	3039487	You're on Orange Sounds Radio.
3039507	3039847	Who's this?
3040667	3041408	Legend of Zaku.
3041708	3042468	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
3042488	3042969	What's on your mind?
3044209	3044730	Nothing much.
3044770	3046571	Just trying to chill this weekend.
3047351	3051154	Just going through the drama of DDR Freak, but...
3052209	3054030	Wait, the trauma of DDR Freak?
3054690	3055511	Drama, I said.
3055571	3056331	The drama.
3056551	3057491	What else is new?
3057511	3059892	Why do you think I only moderate two forums?
3059912	3061833	It has nothing to do with the general populace.
3061893	3064674	It's just within our city and digital life this year.
3065595	3067996	Well, we like drama.
3068036	3069376	What's up with digital life this year?
3070937	3072157	The rules, basically.
3072358	3074538	How folks are chastising.
3074558	3075579	They're just basically...
3076618	3080342	I'm just gonna ask you straight up, are the rules bullshit this year, Zaku?
3093573	3094093	Not really.
3094153	3095654	They're straightforward.
3095694	3098736	As I said, straight PA match.
3099316	3100177	Two out of three.
3100577	3103539	Shuffle, I believe, will be on at all times with left and right.
3103579	3111443	But yeah, it's a far cry from last year's challenge point system where every mod they use would just get you extra points.
3111904	3113344	When is Digital Life this year?
3114325	3115185	At the end of September.
3115446	3116786	You know, I have a credit with JetBlue.
3116826	3117667	I might be able to come back.
3118607	3118787	Oh really?
3118808	3119068	27th to the 30th
3130495	3131135	No, that's cool.
3131256	3133217	Think about it.
3133677	3134778	You already know Don, right?
3134798	3135518	You know Frequency.
3135598	3135778	Yep.
3136119	3143043	Let him know, since he's running the tournament, he might be able to hook you up with space within the booth, perhaps.
3143583	3146565	Hmm.
3146905	3147326	All right.
3147746	3150708	I will give it some serious consideration after I get past this move stuff.
3151969	3153209	I would love to go to Digital Life.
3153249	3155191	I keep hearing about it and I never get to go, so maybe.
3156171	3158212	Hopefully this year will be better than last.
3158293	3158933	I mean, you know.
3159554	3160095	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3173819	3176602	3 grand for Expert Division, and I think $1,500 for Freestyle.
3176622	3178984	Wouldn't you like to see my Freestyle, Zaku?
3179004	3179044	Um...
3200746	3201687	I don't know.
3201747	3202707	I'm trying to think right now.
3203468	3209872	I do want to do a routine this year, but I might be looking for a partner maybe.
3209992	3212873	I don't want to do a solo like last year where I fucked it up.
3213173	3213914	I'll think about it.
3213974	3218637	I'll give Dr. Dick a call and see if he wants to do a freestyle for $1,500 because that might bring him out of hiding.
3219817	3224620	Oh, yeah, and then you'll be up against all the other folks from within the city and possibly the country.
3224960	3225541	All right, we'll see.
3225961	3227502	All right, Zach, anything else you want to share with the listeners?
3228636	3236523	Um, pretty much just have to rant about, you know, certain stores just jacking up the prices on old school stuff.
3237664	3243629	Like the store in the village that I know, they have the gold to mark a $40 for a copy of Punch-Out!!
3244070	3246472	Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!
3246752	3250796	I wonder if that's that same store I got taken to, because they had some really expensive stuff there.
3250816	3251556	Yeah, that's Video Games New York.
3251876	3252057	Yeah.
3252197	3252377	Yeah.
3253684	3259407	The thing is that I managed to find a $15 copy in a flea market in Coney Island.
3259707	3260848	It's all about where you look.
3261008	3261708	It's all about looking.
3262008	3262569	That type of stuff.
3262609	3262869	I know.
3262909	3264830	I could probably go to the farmer's market here and get similar deals.
3265190	3266871	All right, Zach, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, okay?
3267711	3267951	All right.
3268031	3269292	And maybe see you at Digital Life.
3269392	3269732	Maybe.
3270652	3270852	All right.
3270872	3271793	We'll look forward to that.
3271953	3272333	I hope so.
3272353	3272633	We'll see.
3272813	3272993	Bye.
3273934	3274194	Peace.
3274834	3281097	Now I'm really tempted to go because you all know I love New York City, and I do have a credit on JetBlue I have to use within a year, so maybe.
3281898	3282698	Ooh, I'm so tempted.
3283345	3283625	We'll see.
3284026	3285587	Let's see if we get any more calls.
3285607	3289831	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3289851	3291413	But the phones haven't been ringing that much tonight.
3291453	3292554	I guess y'all don't have much to say.
3292914	3295617	I guess we'll go around and ask if there's any last minute stories.
3297359	3297539	No.
3298019	3298179	No?
3298840	3299841	Loki, you have anything tonight?
3301022	3301423	Yeah.
3301883	3306848	As I mentioned earlier, all those rumors from Sony end up becoming true.
3307669	3307809	And...
3308656	3317322	Here's a little bit of something else we were talking about earlier, how the whole rumbling of the 6-axis and stuff is coming sooner than later.
3318383	3328830	Anyways, Kaz Harai has actually admitted that the 6-axis is not the final PlayStation 3 controller.
3330531	3331192	Surprise.
3331332	3334074	And that they're working with Immersion on Rumble.
3334094	3334334	Rumble.
3335385	3364957	and there's also rumors I guess about Mersion's TouchSense technology which might be touch sensitive stuff goody other interesting things let's see here there was there's a DOA toy that you can buy out there now that you can actually remove the clothing off of oh hooray as if you need an excuse to buy those let's see
3365666	3366947	DJ Maxx, PSP Shooter Game
3395768	3396388	Come on in, B-Rangers!
3396508	3397128	They're so cool!
3397188	3402250	Project Gotham Racing 4 actually has the ability to save every single race that everybody does.
3423712	3424613	GS68 agrees the NB Rangers are awesome
3442018	3442779	Um, let's see.
3442979	3445781	Also, GSX-8 wants to know about the Dead or Alive figures.
3445841	3447062	Does it have jiggle-able boobs?
3447623	3449844	No, it doesn't really make them fully naked.
3449864	3451946	It's just you can take them down the bra and panties, I guess.
3452566	3454167	Um, this is interesting.
3454268	3459051	Next week, we're going to get Wing Commander Arena on Xbox Live Arcade for 800 points.
3460592	3461333	Not interested.
3461413	3462013	Sorry.
3462033	3464155	I used to love Wing Commander.
3464175	3465796	If it was original Wing Commander, it'd be great.
3465816	3467838	Yes, if it was original Wing Commander, I'd be sold.
3469046	3487371	and this I'd like to plug real quick it's a PSP IRC version 1.01 and it's an IRC client for the PSP in fact earlier today I was using it in the chat room and it works pretty good it works on a firmware 1.5 as well as those custom firmwares out there um
3488600	3489101	Check it out.
3489281	3493225	It does support an IR keyboard as well if you happen to have one of those.
3493805	3498990	I didn't, but they apparently have tested it with the Targets Universal IR Wireless Keyboard.
3499751	3500932	I guess it's used for PDAs.
3502093	3506918	But if you don't have that, there's another text entry method that's a little bit slower, but still you can do it.
3506978	3507538	It's pretty easy.
3509820	3511342	And then, real quick,
3512452	3522559	There's an interesting rumor going around that Manhunt 2 might be published for the Nintendo Wii despite the AO rating.
3524340	3530283	And that's coming from gonintendo.com, but no word if that's been confirmed yet or not.
3531374	3531754	DarkSakura.com
3549102	3558925	An armed gang of four kidnapped one of the world's top RPG gamers after one criminal's girlfriend lured him into a fake date using Orkut.
3559406	3566168	After sequestering him in Sao Paulo, they held a gun against the victim's head for five hours to get his password, which they wanted to sell for $8,000.
3567668	3569789	After five hours, the hostage wasn't talking.
3570129	3573692	The group leader had a gun against his head at all that time, but the guy didn't say a word.
3574052	3576054	Finally, the crooks gave up and decided to let him go.
3576334	3578756	The Brazilian police then caught the four suspects, age 19, 27.
3580137	3585481	According to police, the captive was the world leader in Gunbound, is who they kidnapped.
3585501	3587222	That guy was the world leader in Gunbound.
3587603	3590285	And, of course, you guys probably know about this game.
3590305	3591846	You've probably heard of it, have some friends that play it.
3592159	3593340	GS68 Gold Farming is Serious Fucking Business
3619366	3621129	Frisbee says, tell me your fucking password.
3621149	3622851	That must have been a very interesting conversation.
3622891	3624414	That would be like an interesting movie plot.
3626236	3628540	GS68 says, I should start on Gunbound.
3628800	3631244	Why would that story make you want to start playing Gunbound?
3633727	3633827	Ugh.
3634609	3634849	All right.
3635356	3636216	Well, that's going to do it.
3636236	3638678	The Skype line wasn't really ringing in any more calls.
3638938	3641119	So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight.
3641479	3644881	And to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
3645882	3647563	Mikotov, thank you so much for being here this week.
3647603	3649023	I stayed through the whole thing.
3649043	3649684	You really did.
3649724	3650304	I'm very impressed.
3650324	3651465	That's the first time in months.
3651485	3653606	And now you're not going to catch a train to go home.
3654646	3655807	Oh, it's 834.
3655927	3656988	Gosh dang it.
3657988	3658368	It's all right.
3658488	3659929	Can I do FUs real quick?
3660430	3660570	No.
3660870	3661330	Dang it.
3661790	3662010	All right.
3662150	3662931	But thank you for being here.
3663211	3663971	You're welcome.
3664211	3665792	Thank you for making me lose money.
3666212	3666672	Sorry.
3668212	3668972	Any final thoughts?
3669812	3671233	I love Survivor a lot.
3673333	3674573	You're so going to get voted out.
3674954	3675434	I don't care.
3675454	3676074	I'm having fun.
3676214	3676514	All right.
3676794	3677774	Loki, your final thought.
3680255	3680635	I don't know.
3681035	3685596	I kind of want to play this Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 3 game.
3686176	3686716	It looks fun.
3688276	3690977	It better be fun because it's expensive.
3693023	3695704	Jamie, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?
3698145	3698485	What?
3700185	3701306	That's your final thought is what?
3701846	3702146	What?
3702406	3702706	What?
3702926	3703226	What?
3703986	3704287	All right.
3704547	3705727	Do they speak English and what?
3708228	3710288	And I also have a final thought for tonight.
3714870	3716370	My vote tonight is for Shane.
3717372	3737804	Shane, you're a real fucking duplicitous asshole and you were plotting against me in the very beginning of this game that you must leave the island tonight whatever, I win take that alright, anyway, thank you guys so much for tuning in to and supporting independent podcasting and independent internet radio
