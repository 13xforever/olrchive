0	24040	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening.
24040	28080	We are here for this Part B of our show and we're going to get right back into the gaming
28080	29080	news.
29080	35320	Just a reminder, we won't be here next week because we are relocating to a new place,
35320	40680	which is code word for I'm moving, and Dark Soccer is going to Disneyland, and Loki's
40680	43600	just taking a night off because he gets one.
43600	48400	If the studio doesn't have good ventilation, I'm buying a wall unit.
48400	49400	I'm not even joking.
49400	50880	I will have to fight the cats in the deck.
50880	52800	Or then we'll move it to your house.
52800	58360	No, because the room that the computer is in also has poor ventilation and a bunch of
58360	59360	stuff in it.
59360	60360	Stuff.
60360	63360	We got a laser pointer for the cat.
63360	65040	You got a laser pointer for the cat?
65040	66640	Or to point at the cat?
66640	67640	To point at the cat.
67640	69680	Oh, I thought maybe you were going to strap a laser pointer onto the cat's head.
69680	70680	They have those.
70680	73760	So you can get a cat with a freaking laser on it.
73760	74760	That's dangerous.
74760	77440	You get a cat with a freaking laser on it and say, alright, come on, let's get back
77440	78680	to the gaming news.
78680	80880	Somebody, quick, start us off.
80880	81880	Anyways.
81880	82880	Pac-Man.
82880	83880	No Pac-Man.
83880	84880	Aww.
84880	89680	So, yeah, it's kind of interesting with the whole announcement with the Wii Fit board.
89680	92440	We kind of talked about this a little bit last week.
92440	99320	Possible other usage for the board, actually, like in, say, a snowboarding game or skateboarding
99320	100320	or whatnot.
100320	104580	But one company that's looking at possibly doing something with it is actually Square
104580	105580	Enix.
105580	109840	And they kind of were saying, they were intrigued by the idea of using weight and balance to
109840	112100	control games.
112100	117140	So possibly, you know, using that in an upcoming RPG.
117140	118560	So that's kind of interesting.
118560	123000	How exactly would you use weight and balance in an RPG?
123000	124000	I have no idea.
124000	127680	Maybe the longer you stand on one foot, the more health you have.
127680	128680	No.
128680	129920	As soon as you fall, oh, zero.
129920	131200	Maybe dodging or something.
131200	132200	I don't know.
132200	134120	I don't see anything like that.
134120	136200	I think it would be good for just like sports games.
136200	139440	Like the next, you know, SSX game or whatever.
139440	142280	Just have that as an optional control method.
142280	145920	Or what we all need, a jump hoping game.
145920	147500	Oh, God.
147500	149280	That one game they have at Dave and Buster's.
149280	151600	That horrible game with the music.
151600	152600	That's what they need.
152600	153600	That jumping rope.
153600	154600	I can't remember what the name of it is.
154600	156240	I'm sure somebody in the chat will yell it out that was there.
156240	157240	I want to play.
157240	158240	What are you talking about?
158240	159240	It's funny.
159240	160240	I don't know.
160240	161240	It's not at our Dave and Buster's, is it?
161240	162240	Thank you.
162240	163240	SSJ100Matt says jump in jackpot.
163240	164240	That's what it's called.
164240	166080	I want to play something where you jump around to music.
166080	168800	I've never done that before.
168800	170760	It's totally by the people that do Flame and Finger.
170760	172760	Oh, then it has to be good.
172760	173760	It's the same soundtrack?
173760	174760	It's similar.
174760	175760	Similar stuff.
175760	176760	Oh, my God.
176760	177760	I love Flame and Finger's soundtrack.
177760	178760	It's so good.
178760	180560	Well, anyway, hold on.
180560	185120	Jump in jackpot is not a role-playing game, so I'm trying to figure out how this could
185120	186480	tie into a role-playing game.
186480	188580	It just doesn't make sense.
188580	192360	Could be for your character walking around, I would assume.
192360	195240	But I don't want to stand when I play a game like Final Fantasy.
195240	199080	Final Fantasy is a game for me to sit on my big butt on the couch and play.
199080	203360	Maybe you could sit on the Wii Fit board and lean back and forth.
203360	206840	Now that I could do.
206840	210960	Plant the Wii Fit board firmly under your large ass.
210960	213240	Lean left to cast black magic.
213240	214960	Lean right to cast white magic.
214960	215960	I don't know.
215960	216960	Silly.
216960	221600	Well, one game that won't be using the Wii Fit board or any Wii peripheral for that matter
221600	223520	is Project Hammer.
223520	225080	This is going back and forth, though.
225080	226080	Some people...
226080	230920	Now, there's an earlier report earlier this week that says Project Hammer is not being
230920	231920	canceled.
231920	237400	That people were just kind of blowing it out of proportion.
237400	242240	There was a spokesperson that was actually at E3 that said, disaster is still under development,
242240	244520	speaking about disaster day of crisis.
244520	247080	We've shifted development resources from Project Hammer.
247080	250200	You may hear about it in the future, but it's off the schedule for now.
250200	254920	Then there was a report on Dig today that said that Project Hammer was gone.
254920	258880	I couldn't tell if it was a misinterpretation of the story or what was going on.
258880	260520	Have you heard anything about Project Hammer?
260520	264400	No, but it's impossible that they misinterpreted the story.
264400	268200	There was one also about that Wii Fit board story.
268200	274000	They were saying, oh my God, they're going to make Final Fantasy Fit, an exercise game,
274000	277000	but they were being sarcastic in the interview because they're like, are you guys going to
277000	280800	make a Final Fantasy Health fitness game?
280800	286720	They're all, no, but we'd more likely use it for an upcoming RPG or something.
286720	289520	Maybe after that, then we'll work on Final Fantasy Fitness.
289520	292280	Being sarcastic and people took it as like, oh my God, they're working on Final Fantasy
292280	293280	Fitness.
293280	296080	It's like, no, it's sarcasm.
296080	298960	Look it up people, what's sarcasm?
298960	304880	I don't know, what is it?
304880	307160	How about some other stuff?
307160	308160	Other stuff?
308160	314400	Well, for those who are keeping track of the numbers, well, the Wii is about ready to kick
314400	317960	the pants off of the Xbox 360.
317960	324640	As far as sales go worldwide, Xbox 360 is sold 10.08 million units.
324640	329920	The Wii is at 9.05 million and PS3 is at 3.63 million.
329920	334860	I think it's great that the Wii is just a million short of the Xbox 360 for having been
334860	337000	up for a shorter amount of time.
337000	345360	As far as the DS, it's 44.97 million units versus the PSP's 22.15 million.
345360	349200	I wouldn't have thought there's more PSPs out there than Xbox 360s though, but then
349200	351200	again, the PSP has been out a long time.
351200	356200	Well, more people are going to want to go for the handhelds anyway.
356200	359920	I guess I forget about families and stuff where every kid has to have their own DS or
359920	361920	their own PSP or whatever it is, you know.
361920	365680	Mommy, he won't give me my game.
365680	366680	That
366680	367680	Exactly that.
367680	374120	Hence why I don't breed.
374120	378040	Do you think that the Wii is going to overtake the 360 very soon?
378040	379040	Yes.
379040	380740	It's already proven.
380740	381740	It all depends.
381740	388040	It probably will just because they keep selling at a consistent rate, but at the same time,
388040	391920	we don't know what Microsoft has up their sleeves and obviously they're not just going
391920	395340	to let them take the top spot.
395340	400040	If you look at it this way, the Xbox 360, as I'm aware, should already be on a slight
400040	404980	decline ever since it reached the peak unless, of course, they come out because I don't really
404980	408560	think that the new units are going to be much of a reason to go buy a new one.
408560	413140	But the Wii, however, it's really, really sort of a wildfire kind of thing.
413140	416120	The more people that are getting it, the more they're telling other people and it really
416120	419320	appeals to much broader demographics.
419320	422640	Microsoft does have Halo 3 in the wings and that's going to move us a little bit.
422640	423640	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
423640	424640	Next.
424640	427040	We have some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelandtrady.com.
427040	429160	We love having the folks talking here.
429160	432400	Dr. Foeve says, that's not fair.
432400	438540	If the 360 in PlayStation 3 was $249, it would destroy the Wii's numbers.
438540	439540	But it's not.
439540	443600	I mean, that's kind of like part of the charm of the Wii and the reason why a lot of families
443600	449360	and soccer moms are going for it is not just the whole like, oh, my kids can get up and
449360	450360	move around and so can I.
450360	451360	But it's cheap.
451360	452360	It's cheap on the market.
452360	456160	I'm considering the hit for people who care about that, which I'm really not, but people
456160	462680	who care about their graphical quality, the Wii is really not as big of a graphic powerhouse
462680	465800	as the Xbox 360 or the PS3 will be.
465800	468440	But then again, the people who are playing the Wii are the people who actually like to
468440	469760	play a good game.
469760	471680	Well, I don't know.
471680	474840	I would say care more about game play than they do about how it looks.
474840	476880	But see, there's very few good games on the Wii.
476880	481600	I mean, you got Zelda, yes, but after that, I mean, there's not a lot of like...
481600	482600	Games.
482600	485760	But most of them are like mini games, a lot, a lot, a lot.
485760	486760	You know what I mean?
486760	487760	Over and over.
487760	488760	No, there's actual games.
488760	494360	Like maybe Trauma Center, but there's not a lot of like long-lasting type games.
494360	496040	Even Cookin' Mama lost its thrill for me.
496040	497280	It was more of a DS game for me.
497280	500080	By the way, I need to borrow that.
500080	501480	There it is.
501480	506480	Anyways, well, PlayStation 3 may be dead last in the whole thing, but at least they have
506480	507480	something to brag about.
507480	513720	Other than that, it would be that they're selling twice as many PlayStation 3s in Japan
513720	517240	than they are Xbox 360s.
517240	522800	Of course, they've reached their 1 million mark in Japan, and Microsoft is still trailing
522800	524440	behind.
524440	530960	But it's only going to get stronger, I guess, with releases from both companies can actually
530960	533160	be pretty good in Japan, I think.
533160	537040	See there's Microsoft's real problem, because in that last story, we were looking at the
537040	540800	worldwide numbers, where the Wii is starting to overtake the 360.
540800	546280	Well, the reason why the 360 has not had a further gap on the Wii is because it's still
546280	551320	not cracking the market in Japan, which is interesting, because they've had games like
551320	554640	Blue Dragon now for a little bit, and did Eternal Sonata come out there finally?
554640	557760	I think it did, or Trusty Bell, whatever it's called.
557760	560520	These games are not moving as many units as folks thought it would.
560520	563280	So I think that's the 360's biggest problem when you're going to look at the worldwide
563280	565240	numbers is that they still cannot crack Japan.
565240	571920	Well, they have 2.5 million Wiis in Japan as well, so, you know, whereas they may be
571920	575040	outselling the 360, they're still not number one.
575040	580640	But I don't know, Japan is an important market, it's not the largest market, though, and if
580640	585240	they're looking for numbers, I mean, I still think they need to focus, I guess, on the
585240	587560	U.S. and the U.K.
587560	592840	Well, who knows, maybe these will help move some Xboxes, but probably not.
592840	598400	Some new demos are out on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and the demos are for Juiced 2, because you
598400	603360	know the Japanese love their Juiced, and FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, because I think that's big
603360	605080	over there in Tokyo as well.
605080	608960	It's going to be in the U.K., actually, the FlatOut one, which reminds me, I need to get
608960	612400	a U.K. account so I can download that, because I love me some FlatOut.
612400	618000	Well, those games are actually, it's funny, because actually the demo for Juiced 2 is
618000	622520	actually not available in Japan, so that won't move any units over there.
622520	626480	FlatOut Racing, by the way, is only available in Europe, as Loki already referred to.
626480	630920	These are new racing games coming out, because, you know, if there's one thing the Xbox 360
630920	633720	is completely lacking, it's racing games.
633720	638120	Now, now, FlatOut, though, you would like FlatOut, because FlatOut is a little bit like
638120	645000	Burnout, except it's not as fast, but if you crash, you can eject your driver through the
645000	646000	windshield.
646000	647400	Ooh, I might have to try this.
647400	649920	Okay, I will download this demo.
649920	651880	I like the idea of an eject button.
651880	658520	Well, speaking of eject, but here's the best part about it, Rob, they have a whole set
658520	665600	of mini-games based around ejecting the driver out, including basketball, bowling, high jump,
665600	666600	all sorts of things.
666600	669040	Can I eject him into a wall of pillows?
669040	670040	Uh-huh.
670040	671040	Amazing.
671040	674280	How about a stack of Twinkies?
674280	677280	Instead of a cream filling, it's a blood filling.
677280	678280	Ew.
678280	684960	Well, Xbox, poor, poor Microsoft.
684960	691620	At the report for the end of their fiscal year for June 30th, they reported a 1.9 billion
691620	693400	dollar loss.
693400	700160	1.2 billion was from the fourth quarter when they said, hey, guess what, the Red Ring of
700160	703480	Death are bad.
703480	711960	However, they're expecting to hopefully redeem themselves soon, I don't know, we'll see.
711960	712960	Well...
712960	716880	Maybe they'll drop the price for real?
716880	720520	I think that's what's coming, and I think when we talk about that whole sales thing
720520	724320	earlier, I think a price drop is coming, definitely before Christmas, probably about the time
724320	725320	Halo 3 is.
725320	728200	They're gonna bank way too much on Halo 3, pulling in money, and the sad thing is that
728200	729200	I think they will.
729200	733400	I know, I'm like, it's actually probably what's best for them.
733400	740280	But they're not just banking on Halo 3, there's Halo 3, Project Author Racing 4, Mass Effect,
740280	742480	Grand Theft Auto 4, all those big titles that are...
742480	745960	Eternal Sonata is the game I'm most excited about, sadly, out of everything.
745960	750640	There's a huge lineup, they're not all banking just on Halo 3.
750640	753920	Carcassonne 2?
753920	759200	But Sonya's doing the same thing, they've got a pretty good lineup for the fall, just
759200	764160	there isn't as much.
764160	767880	Well how does this whole Red Rings thing ultimately impact Microsoft?
767880	771680	Well, it's already impacted them.
771680	774600	They're having to extend all those warranties on top of it, you know.
774600	776760	Yeah, they're gonna have to sell millions more systems.
776760	778480	That's money out of their pocket.
778480	780160	Well it's not getting any better for them.
780160	782140	Should've done it right the first time, hi!
782140	784640	They're gonna greenlight Halo 4 now.
784640	793440	They're phasing a second class action lawsuit regarding the scratched disc issue, and really,
793440	798360	you know, they are to blame for this, I mean, it's such a simple fix.
798360	805920	The issue comes from people jiggling the Xbox 360 while the disc is spinning, causing the
805920	810300	actual laser to scratch a nice little ring into the disc.
810300	813840	Why would you pick up your Xbox 360 and shake it while the disc is moving?
813840	814840	Here's why.
814840	819920	Maybe you think it's a baby.
819920	824800	A lot of people are fascinated by, there's a little mercury switch in there that when
824800	831680	you tilt your 360, whether it's upright or laying flat, the rings always face, like the
831680	833400	one player ring will stay in the top corner.
833400	837480	Did you say people are fascinated by the mercury switch?
837480	839560	Yes.
839560	841720	People are retarded, okay?
841720	847760	Because anybody that's either knocked this thing over or for whatever reason, just playing
847760	850200	the 360 will not scratch your discs.
850200	856760	You have to be doing something wrong for it to scratch your discs, and what's even worse
856760	860280	about it is the whole thing could've been fixed with just a few little pads of foam
860280	861280	in there.
861280	867040	We're just not shaking your Xbox 360 to watch the light tip up and down, or take the disc
867040	868200	out if you're gonna do that.
868200	874640	Or even better, just, you know, I don't know, don't be retarded with it.
874640	877480	And yeah, the chatroom agrees over at chat.orangetalk.com.
877480	881700	Blaze says, well, people shouldn't be dumb shits and do stupid things like that.
881700	884920	And Son of Dad thinks it happens because there's candy inside.
884920	886880	It's like a pinata, you shake it.
886880	890200	Viva pinata, I get it.
890200	892040	You're especially funny tonight, Miklata.
892040	896560	I'm always funny when I talk, over, over.
896560	902760	Blaze says, I've had my 360 get knocked over on me.
902760	906640	It looked like a stapler got shot into the disc 20 times.
906640	909480	I thought when I first read that, I thought he said that's what he did to the person that
909480	910480	knocked it over.
910480	911760	He shot a stapler into him 20 times.
911760	912760	I'm thinking that would hurt.
912760	917760	That reminds me of that scene in the UHF where he shoots him with the staple gun.
917760	919080	See, that's the thing, though.
919080	924160	I don't understand how, okay, granted, it should've been fixed.
924160	931000	The foam in there couldn't have cost less than a dollar to fix this thing.
931000	932000	I don't know why...
932000	933080	That's a whole dollar.
933080	937260	It's less than a dollar, okay, to fix this.
937260	940720	I don't know why they didn't, but for whatever reason, they didn't.
940720	946220	Either way, though, still, don't jiggle the machine.
946220	950280	It says in the manual not to do it, but then again, the Wii manual says not to throw it
950280	955160	through your TV, and people do that anyway, so I guess, you know...
955160	956660	They want to sue Nintendo.
956660	959680	The Wii broke my TV because it doesn't bounce.
959680	964680	I guess, you know, it's like, I don't know what you got to do.
964680	968160	Walk these people through how to handle their console.
968160	969440	Don't shake the console.
969440	970840	It doesn't like it.
970840	972120	It will scratch your disc.
972120	976000	Have you ever seen those posters like Downtown when you're driving or whatever that says
976000	977440	don't shake your baby?
977440	978440	A message from the...
978440	983040	Actually, the headquarters for that is right by where I work, and after talking with some
983040	990960	of those people, no, because the whole thing started because a nanny shaped this guy's
990960	992200	baby and killed her.
992200	993200	Oh my God.
993200	994200	I mean, it's sad.
994200	997300	I'm not trying to make light of it, but you have to admit it's fascinating that there
997300	1000560	is a headquarters dedicated to not shaking babies.
1000560	1003680	It's like, dude, common sense.
1003680	1007440	You're dealing with somebody who is not fully developed.
1007440	1008600	Why would you shake them?
1008600	1013560	Well, the Xbox 360 is not fully developed either, so don't shake it.
1013560	1022400	I want to work for that company and work in their product test support and see if one
1022400	1025040	day they make a model of a baby that can be shaking.
1025040	1026040	Heart babies.
1026040	1035440	I like them when they're quiet.
1035440	1039440	I like them with a straw in their head to drink.
1039440	1043160	What is wrong with you?
1043160	1044160	So real quick...
1044160	1045160	Seriously?
1045160	1046680	Video games, Rob.
1046680	1048000	Back to video games.
1048000	1050000	Is video games what caused you to be so violent?
1050000	1055880	I would, however, like to encourage our listeners to go to DontShakeYourBaby.com.
1055880	1060520	Just don't shake babies, and don't shake Xbox 360s, and while you're at it, just don't
1060520	1066520	shake people or things in general unless they're stupid and then throttle them, or unless it's
1066520	1070280	a can of Coke that you're about to hand to your friend to watch them open.
1070280	1071280	That is funny.
1071280	1072280	Nothing else is.
1072280	1073280	You can shake your booty.
1073280	1075640	Well, yes, and watch me shake my ass right now.
1075640	1076640	Here's the better part.
1076640	1077640	That's the whole thing.
1077640	1078640	Right in front of my face, though.
1078640	1079640	Thank you.
1079640	1084760	The plaintiff to this whole case, Christine Moskowitz, she says she was displeased when
1084760	1090800	the Xbox 360 she purchased for her son wrote copies of Gears of War, Crackdown, and Saints
1090800	1091800	Row.
1091800	1098360	A second plaintiff, Dan Wood, claimed that his system ruined Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell
1098360	1099360	disc.
1099360	1101080	Okay, she purchased it for her son.
1101080	1102080	How old is her son?
1102080	1104760	Because I think those are all M-rated games.
1104760	1105760	Hmm?
1105760	1106760	Hmm?
1106760	1107760	Yeah.
1107760	1118040	Anyways, I'm sorry, assuming that he is the proper age to use or to play those games,
1118040	1124240	I'm sorry, wouldn't you learn, hmm, shaking it broke one of my games.
1124240	1126400	Maybe I shouldn't do that.
1126400	1127760	What's that grinding noise?
1127760	1130760	Instead, he's like, hmm, I'll put a different disc in there.
1130760	1132760	Hmm, it makes the noise again.
1132760	1137880	Oh, we better sue them because we're at $150.
1137880	1141080	Boo-fucking-hoo.
1141080	1146240	I think this calls for an Orange Lounge Radio Public Service Announcement, so if we may,
1146240	1150760	let's bring on an Orange Lounge Radio Public Service Announcement.
1150760	1151760	Camera please.
1151760	1152760	Alright, thank you.
1152760	1153760	Ready?
1153760	1156760	Lights, camera, and action.
1156760	1169800	Hi, this is Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you not to shake your Xbox
1169800	1177200	360 because if you do, then you deserve to have your $60 games broke down on you.
1177200	1179400	Also, please don't shake children.
1179400	1182960	That was the worst public service announcement ever.
1182960	1187720	Can we get back into stories, please?
1187720	1188720	No.
1188720	1190720	Well, the next story is mine.
1190720	1192320	Okay, fine.
1192320	1195600	Let's talk about Metal Gear Solid 4 on the Xbox 360.
1195600	1197600	That's okay, never mind.
1197600	1198600	No, seriously.
1198600	1199600	Seriously, I know.
1199600	1205480	I don't know why I'm bringing this up, but Metal Gear Solid 4 again is rumored to go
1205480	1212640	on the Xbox 360, and I'm thinking, did they just not have E3 happen, and did they not
1212640	1216880	just reconfirm that the game is going to be a PS3 exclusive and all this, blah, blah,
1216880	1217880	blah?
1217880	1221600	Well, the official Xbox Magazine comes out and says that it's going to be coming to the
1221600	1228880	Xbox 360 a few months after the PlayStation 3 version, and this is just after Kazumi Kitawe
1228880	1233040	said at E3, since Metal Gear Solid was born for the PlayStation, we'd like to keep it
1233040	1238760	as a PlayStation game, but we might have to take some steps, and that's the whole reason
1238760	1241780	why people are thinking again it's coming to the Xbox 360.
1241780	1244120	I'm just thinking, let it go!
1244120	1245120	Let it go!
1245120	1248120	Here's the other thing, though.
1248120	1255240	To argue for it coming to the 360, hasn't everything that Sony's basically told...
1255240	1261120	I know this is not Sony, but they're speaking for the Sony platform, I guess.
1261120	1266160	Hasn't everything that they've denied come true anyways?
1266160	1269320	And granted, they probably don't want to make an announcement that it's actually coming
1269320	1276760	out for Xbox 360, because then that pretty much shoots their chance for an actual really
1276760	1282000	good exclusive game coming to their platform.
1282000	1287400	I'm just bothered by the fact that they can't get away from this, and this comes up a week
1287400	1293040	after E3, when they got up there and reaffirmed it's coming out for PlayStation 3 only.
1293040	1298520	If they do have plans for the Xbox 360, it's going to be a huge time difference in the
1298520	1302140	releases, because I don't think they'll bring it out until the PlayStation 3 has proved
1302140	1305120	it can't sell the copies that Konami wants it to sell.
1305120	1306120	So I don't know.
1306120	1310440	I just get very bothered by all these constant, like every week there's some new stupid rumor
1310440	1313520	about Metal Gear Solid 4 around all the different game blogs.
1313520	1315400	And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
1315400	1321580	But I mean, it's going to be a long time after the release of the initial game, right?
1321580	1324360	If it does happen, it'll be a long time after, right?
1324360	1325360	Right.
1325360	1326360	I think so.
1326360	1332040	When I have to read the same news story four, five times across the scope of a couple months
1332040	1336400	just because some stupid rumor ignites all the blogs around the world, I get angsty.
1336400	1340460	I don't know about the rest of you, but it seems like no better time to bring out the
1340460	1344800	FUs of the Week.
1344800	1353360	Jamie, start us off please with the FUs of the Week.
1353360	1356800	I actually have a two-part one because one's related to the other.
1356800	1362400	First of all, I'd like to say FU to laminate flooring because, okay, this is how I broke
1362400	1363400	my ribs.
1363400	1364400	Okay.
1364400	1367120	I had just got back from the gym and I stepped into the tub.
1367120	1368240	I did not even sit down.
1368240	1370880	I just stepped into the tub and my phone rang.
1370880	1373080	So I stepped out, dried off my feet.
1373080	1378240	I made sure to dry off my feet, stepped into the hallway and down I went.
1378240	1382600	And I fell sort of skewed with my elbow into my side and I banged my knee really hard and
1382600	1385000	I thought that all I hurt was my knee.
1385000	1389440	The next morning I woke up and my ribs were blue and I hurt quite a bit.
1389440	1393400	So I went to the doctor that day and he put me in a lot of Vicodin.
1393400	1395680	And I'm fully functional on Vicodin.
1395680	1401640	I can go to my job and do my work and I'm fine as long as I'm focused on one thing.
1401640	1404860	But when I take it, I can't really do...
1404860	1410160	I'm not the multitasker I normally am and Rob, you know how I do 50 million things at
1410160	1411160	once.
1411160	1413160	I don't pay attention to that many things.
1413160	1420680	So I was in a conversation with somebody who is a wonderful, funny person, very nice person
1420680	1426920	who I think takes things a little too personally sometimes.
1426920	1431160	She linked me to this product that I didn't think was very funny.
1431160	1433360	It's a bird feeder that flings squirrels off.
1433360	1436040	That's sad for squirrels.
1436040	1437040	I know squirrels.
1437040	1438200	Well, see, that's what I thought.
1438200	1440420	I like squirrels better than birds.
1440420	1446320	And I thought it was funny, I thought it was a good product as long as it doesn't hurt
1446320	1447320	the poor squirrels.
1447320	1449480	How about a bird feeder that flings birds off?
1449480	1450480	That would be funny.
1450480	1451480	That would be great.
1451480	1452480	I like birds though, too.
1452480	1457080	I used to actually buy bird feeders that squirrels could get on and I would put nuts in it.
1457080	1459280	Or a bird feeder that kicks them in the nuts.
1459280	1462320	No, no, let me finish, okay?
1462320	1466320	And so, it's just like, sorry for offending you and slide off.
1466320	1469760	I'm not saying I'm who it is because I'm a nice person.
1469760	1474760	But it's, I was like, dude, if I wasn't, I wasn't offended and I was offended now, you
1474760	1475760	know what I mean?
1475760	1481600	It's like, first of all, everybody, when you're dealing with people, don't fucking make assumptions
1481600	1482960	about how they feel.
1482960	1485680	Ask them first, how do you feel?
1485680	1491000	All you're going to do is piss them off and, you know, cause drama that doesn't need to
1491000	1492000	be caused.
1492000	1497600	You need to not, people need to not be afraid to ask someone how they feel.
1497600	1498960	Don't make assumptions.
1498960	1503960	All it does is make an ass out of you and only you, okay?
1503960	1509160	You know, I think that it's just this whole, oh, I don't want to offend people and I don't
1509160	1511560	want to, well then fucking ask.
1511560	1513040	You know, what's the worst thing they're going to say?
1513040	1515800	Oh, you know, I don't feel all that great about it right now and if they don't want
1515800	1518640	to talk about it, they'll fucking tell you I don't want to talk about it right now and
1518640	1519640	respect it.
1519640	1525240	You know, don't just assume because then I've been, you know, pissed off now for three days
1525240	1532720	over this and you know, I'm a good, I'm a good person, I think I'm a good person, you
1532720	1533720	know.
1533720	1535720	Don't you think I'm a good person?
1535720	1536720	Yeah, okay.
1536720	1542200	But I just think that, you know, instead of worrying about, you know, kid gloves and stepping
1542200	1545800	on toes, if you don't want to step on toes, ask them where their toes are so that you
1545800	1546800	don't step on them.
1546800	1547800	That's what I think.
1547800	1548800	Good?
1548800	1549800	All finished?
1549800	1558600	I think that I was fairly, um, I had tact in my words, don't you think?
1558600	1561440	I was going to say tactical, but that's what you're trying to kill people.
1561440	1563640	Okay, we got to keep it going.
1563640	1565640	Loki, your FU is the weed.
1565640	1569480	FU to paper Mario sucking.
1569480	1574680	Why did I spend $10 on that?
1574680	1579880	My FU of the week goes to Shane, um, because he was plotting against me in the beginning
1579880	1585920	of Survivor LJ to get me kicked out and, uh, you're, you're a jerk.
1585920	1586920	Still does.
1586920	1587920	Hey, wait a minute.
1587920	1588920	Wait a minute.
1588920	1589920	Whoa.
1589920	1590920	I get FU, right?
1590920	1591920	Yes.
1591920	1592920	Your turn.
1592920	1593920	F U.
1593920	1594920	Oh, crap.
1594920	1595920	I had one.
1595920	1596920	Where did it go?
1596920	1597920	Okay.
1597920	1598920	I have two FUs.
1598920	1601920	One I can remember, then I'll come up with the other one in a second.
1601920	1606680	FU to Europe or the UK or whatever, because they got that location test for the Silent
1606680	1612120	Hill Arcade game and it looks really sweet and I want to play it so bad, um, and I'm
1612120	1616520	not going to fly over there to play it, but maybe I will someday.
1616520	1621440	And then FU to, um, next, not this coming Tuesday, but next Tuesday, because it'll be
1621440	1630920	the final day of the Konami San Francisco offices, and that'll be the end of that.
1630920	1631920	Okay.
1631920	1634280	That's that.
1634280	1636640	All done with the FUs of the week.
1636640	1640760	Let's move on and back into the gaming news, then.
1640760	1645000	Well, and this makes me kind of laugh because it's kind of a stupid name, but there's
1645000	1650720	a new princess for Super Mario Galaxies that they have, uh, seen, uh, in Famitsu scans
1650720	1655060	named Rosetta, and I just want to, I think Stone instantly, because you know the Rosetta
1655060	1657040	Stone was a big translator thing.
1657040	1658040	Anyway.
1658040	1662680	So, she used to hang out with Daisy and Peach and, and, watch your face, who wasn't even
1662680	1666040	a princess from the first game, Pauline.
1666040	1671240	She was a princess, she was just some hoochie from New York, so she doesn't need to be
1671240	1672240	the princesses.
1672240	1673240	Pauline.
1673240	1676920	She's not good enough to be a princess, she's just a hooker.
1676920	1680400	Pauline wasn't in, uh, the Super Mario Brothers movie, was she?
1680400	1681400	She's Donkey Kong.
1681400	1682400	I don't think so.
1682400	1683400	She's just Donkey Kong.
1683400	1685400	She's Mario Brothers First Love.
1685400	1688960	And that's when he found out his, that Peach would put out, I guess, I don't know.
1688960	1693800	But, um, she's, she's, I guess, pretty.
1693800	1699120	If you like, you know, dumb blondes, I guess, no, I don't know.
1699120	1705260	Well, fear not, folks, um, we talked a little bit about the Wii Balance Board and Part A,
1705260	1710640	but, um, Nintendo has come out to promise that there will be, they will be making more
1710640	1716040	Balance Board based games, so it's, you're not going to be buying this thing for only
1716040	1718040	one game.
1718040	1721040	Hooray!
1721040	1722040	What else are they developing?
1722040	1723040	Have they said anything?
1723040	1724040	No!
1724040	1725040	They did not.
1725040	1727760	They just said, yeah, we're working on stuff.
1727760	1733600	Gee, could it possibly be, I don't know, another game that involves a lot of mini games?
1733600	1737480	Possibly, and I'm going to guess, uh, the next WarioWare game.
1737480	1738880	Oh, God, probably.
1738880	1740880	That would make sense.
1740880	1742440	That might be fun, though.
1742440	1745360	I did like WarioWare on the Wii, I'll give you that.
1745360	1748200	Well, this might be kind of fun on the Wii as well, even though I already own this game
1748200	1753760	on the Xbox 360, but Rockstar Table Tennis is coming out for the Wii.
1753760	1757400	Rockstar has confirmed that the game is coming out, but that's really about it.
1757400	1760840	It's just saying that the game is coming, it will take full advantage of the Wii Remote
1760840	1765280	and everything that comes with that, and, uh, there's another quote here, quote, a new
1765280	1769240	audience can now experience a game that is beautifully designed and impossible to put
1769240	1770240	down.
1770240	1774480	Rockstar Table Tennis was kind of one of those early hits on the Xbox 360, one of the earlier
1774480	1778120	games I enjoy, but it would be interesting to see how the game mechanics are going to
1778120	1779120	change on the Wii.
1779120	1787520	As long as they had the Nunchuck part actually move you, and the Wiimote beard, with a paddle,
1787520	1788520	is that what it's called?
1788520	1789520	Yeah.
1789520	1790520	Then I don't see any problem with it.
1790520	1791520	It should be actually pretty fun.
1791520	1793280	I wonder how this is going to work with the different spins that you put on your ball,
1793280	1796480	because that was a big part of the game, was that you had to look at the tiny little, the
1796480	1800360	ball that was coming at you, and the tiny color that surrounded it so you could tell
1800360	1803720	what way it was spinning, and then you counter with different types of spins.
1803720	1807800	Maybe hold down an A button when you do it, or the this button back here that you guys
1807800	1810360	can see me pointing at with my imaginary Wiimote.
1810360	1814320	I don't know which one this is called anymore because I don't own a Wii anymore.
1814320	1815320	Why did you get rid of your Wii?
1815320	1816880	Because I didn't play it.
1816880	1818760	I let it stay broken for like five months.
1818760	1819760	Who'd you sell it to?
1819760	1820760	How'd you sell it?
1820760	1824440	I had a friend of a friend that wanted one, so I was like, give me money, I'll give you
1824440	1825440	this Wii.
1825440	1826440	But wasn't it a broken Wii?
1826440	1827440	Like you had to send it back to Nintendo?
1827440	1828440	I sent it back to Nintendo.
1828440	1829440	They gave me a brand new one completely.
1829440	1830440	Oh, okay.
1830440	1831440	So.
1831440	1832440	So you sold your friend a brand new Wii?
1832440	1833440	Yes.
1833440	1834440	Amazing.
1834440	1836720	Just like how I sold my friend my 360 one time, and like a month later it got the Red
1836720	1837720	Rings of Death.
1837720	1842640	I felt really happy about that because I avoided it.
1842640	1843640	You are evil.
1843640	1844640	Yes.
1844640	1845640	All right.
1845640	1848840	Well, I'll definitely check out the game when it comes to the Wii, but I don't know if I
1848840	1850200	want to spend all that money on it.
1850200	1854480	That's why I wish the Wii had demos.
1854480	1859280	But if they had demos, then how would they get you to buy $10 games for Nintendo 64 on
1859280	1860760	it?
1860760	1861760	Good question.
1861760	1864200	Maybe you should have played them when they originally came out, then you would know if
1864200	1866160	they sucked or not.
1866160	1868000	But I can get videos on Nintendo.com.
1868000	1869000	Great.
1869000	1871720	I can watch YouTube.
1871720	1873200	So guess what?
1873200	1874200	What?
1874200	1877920	Atari likes horses, and people who love horses.
1877920	1883800	They're coming out with a game called My Horse and Me for Wii DS and PC that, from what I
1883800	1890320	can understand, it's a horse-raising and riding simulation.
1890320	1892800	Ride them horses, huh?
1892800	1898360	Well, they're basically, and there's a quote on here saying, we're looking forward to providing
1898360	1903440	the horse-enthusiastic community with a rich and authentic game that allows gamers to take
1903440	1906280	care of and complete a variety of challenges with their horse.
1906280	1910480	Is there a big cross-section of the population that are horse enthusiasts and video game
1910480	1911480	players?
1911480	1914400	I know, but they're the same type that play video games?
1914400	1919680	I know a person who's a horse enthusiast who loves video games, and she likes playing Guitar
1919680	1920680	Hero Drunk.
1920680	1921680	One.
1921680	1922680	So you know one.
1922680	1926280	Out of all the horse games, though, out there, you should consider this one, because the
1926280	1931800	game features the most accurate horse models and animations yet realized in a video game.
1931800	1933480	I think I would play it.
1933480	1935360	Take that, Final Furlong.
1935360	1937080	You know what I say to this game?
1937080	1938080	Nay.
1938080	1941480	I think I'm going to get the game.
1941480	1942480	I really think I'll play it.
1942480	1944040	Well, have fun.
1944040	1945440	Can you whip the horse with a Wiimote?
1945440	1946440	That might make me change my mind.
1946440	1947440	That might be kind of fun.
1947440	1948440	Maybe.
1948440	1950800	And then I can name the horse Britney Spears, and I can whip Britney Spears, just like it
1950800	1952280	was Derby Owners Club.
1952280	1953600	I love Derby Owners Club, okay?
1953600	1954600	I know you do.
1954600	1956600	There you go.
1956600	1959940	The Rob D says, you know, I've always been begging the video game industry for accurate
1959940	1960940	horse physics.
1960940	1962940	I'm glad they listened.
1962940	1966120	I have a feeling that might be some of that sarcasm thing somebody was talking about earlier.
1966120	1968120	I don't know.
1968120	1969120	Possibly.
1969120	1974280	Anyways, another game coming out by Take-Two and Rockstar, Bully.
1974280	1978720	The scholarship edition is now coming to the Xbox 360 and the Wii.
1978720	1983520	So, you know, you thought before that you may be able to get your, you know, Grand Theft
1983520	1987480	Auto on on the Wii with Manhunt 2.
1987480	1993240	Hopefully you'll be able to get your Bully on, I guess, with the Wii sooner than that.
1993240	1995080	But I don't know.
1995080	1996480	It got a teen rating before.
1996480	1999640	I don't see why we get any more than a teen rating now.
1999640	2002520	I'm looking forward to maybe picking this up on the 360.
2002520	2007540	Yeah, I'm kind of glad I missed it the last round on the PlayStation 2, because I was
2007540	2009760	so immersed in my 360 at that time.
2009760	2013700	I'm kind of glad they are going to put it on 360 after all, so I can play it in high
2013700	2015800	def and widescreen and all that good stuff.
2015800	2019680	And I believe it will have new content as well for it, so...
2019680	2021480	More guys to make out with?
2021480	2023760	Yes, more guys to make out with.
2023760	2024760	Hooray!
2024760	2030160	Imagine what you could do with the Wii mode.
2030160	2031160	I don't know, Miklotov.
2031160	2032160	What?
2032160	2033160	You could write on the chalkboards.
2033160	2034160	Oh, okay.
2034160	2035160	You could.
2035160	2039280	What were you thinking?
2039280	2040280	I don't know.
2040280	2041280	Geez.
2041280	2042280	That's why I had to ask.
2042280	2050720	Well, also coming out for the Xbox 360 is Guilty Gear 2 Overture.
2050720	2052480	But here's the interesting thing.
2052480	2057840	It's not supposed to be a fighting game.
2057840	2062280	Basically in the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine, Guilty Gear 2 Overture was revealed to be
2062280	2064960	a game a lot more like Soul Calibur Legends.
2064960	2070160	It's an action title and also has a little bit of adventure thrown in for good measure.
2070160	2072320	It's not a fighting game, but who cares?
2072320	2077480	I'm sure a lot of fans of Guilty Gear are going to eat this up anyway, right?
2077480	2082320	It does our soul bad guy.
2082320	2083320	Soul is awesome.
2083320	2084320	I love Soul Bad Guy.
2084320	2085320	Soul Bad Guy is great.
2085320	2087000	And Soul's going to be in there with a newcomer named Sin.
2087000	2089800	Who looks like Kai, but who to that?
2089800	2091720	I liked Eno.
2091720	2094280	I was a fan of Zappa, love Zappa.
2094280	2095280	And I love Faust.
2095280	2096280	Oh, yeah.
2096280	2097280	Faust, of course.
2097280	2098280	I like Venom too.
2098280	2102960	And I'm sad though, because this is before I lost all that weight, as I cosplayed Biken,
2102960	2106000	which Dan didn't like because of like, you know, boob.
2106000	2109120	But I found a Faust cosplayer that same year.
2109120	2110120	That's awesome.
2110120	2113480	Did he rape you with his scalpel, like in the game?
2113480	2119760	I actually did hit him with the claw by accident, but I had to give the claw back to Evan because
2119760	2122320	it was part of his toys.
2122320	2126360	I won't say anything else.
2126360	2127960	I'll tell you off of the show.
2127960	2128960	Okay.
2128960	2129960	There you go then.
2129960	2130960	Ah!
2130960	2136320	I'm glad you didn't say that on a mic.
2136320	2137320	I'm kind of disappointed.
2137320	2138320	Hey, is it my turn again?
2138320	2139680	Yes, it is your turn again.
2139680	2147720	Speaking of all things devilish, there is a Capcom 2D fighting game called Sengoku Basara
2147720	2155960	X, or I should say pronounced as Cross, but it's a Devil Kings fighting game.
2155960	2161840	It is actually based on, well Devil Kings is the name it's known by in North America.
2161840	2172000	You get the Devil Kings, Scorpio, Azure Dragon, Forced, and Iron Ox, at least what their names
2172000	2173000	are in the U.S.
2173000	2177840	But the game's supposed to hit arcades in Japan this winter.
2177840	2178840	I'm looking forward to that.
2178840	2179840	I know the series.
2179840	2184360	I'm surprised to see that they're actually making that into a fighting game.
2184360	2188800	I don't think there was that many characters, but it can't be any worse than the actual
2188800	2191680	Devil Kings game.
2191680	2197320	So yeah, there's this rumor going around before about Halo on the DS, and it was interesting
2197320	2203720	because I believe they did get Bungie's Brian Gerard to comment on it.
2203720	2207820	Apparently, there is such a thing, I guess, in concept.
2207820	2214640	People have made concept versions of the game to pitch to them, but nothing, obviously,
2214640	2216720	has come out.
2216720	2221600	So they're saying, Microsoft, of course, doesn't publish any DS games or license them.
2221600	2225200	So I don't know, will it ever get created?
2225200	2226200	Who knows.
2226200	2233800	But, argument's sake, there are a few different versions of Halo for the DS out there.
2233800	2236440	Like what is created as jokes or what?
2236440	2240160	Like pitching, like, hey, we want to bring Halo to the DS.
2240160	2242720	Here's what we can do with it, and then showing them off again.
2242720	2246120	What's the problem if Microsoft never plans to get into the handheld market?
2246120	2247120	What's the problem?
2247120	2250120	There's 44 million DSs out there to sell product to.
2250120	2253240	Who says it won't happen at some point?
2253240	2254240	It'd be weird.
2254240	2256000	It'd be very weird.
2256000	2260920	I kind of think, though, a little bit like, I don't know if it's a good thing because
2260920	2268200	I mean, look at the last time they tried something like that with the CDI, remember the Mario
2268200	2269200	and the...
2269200	2270200	Oh, yes.
2270200	2271640	Wanda Gamelan and all that stuff.
2271640	2272640	All the games.
2272640	2273640	Yeah.
2273640	2277040	But, I mean, hey, I wish that that would kind of happen because that'd be pretty awesome.
2277040	2282240	You know, have Nintendo developing games for the Xbox 360 that are a little bit higher
2282240	2286520	end and then have Microsoft developing stuff for the DS.
2286520	2288360	That'd be pretty cool.
2288360	2289360	Good stuff.
2289360	2290360	All right.
2290360	2295400	Well, moving back over to the Xbox 360, which, of course, is where the Halo series will soon
2295400	2300720	show up, what's going on is that there is actually a new hack out there.
2300720	2307880	The Xbox hacker forums have stated that the Xbox 360's DVD key and game region code can
2307880	2312440	now be altered to break down the region locks for some games.
2312440	2315800	Here's a quote from the person who did it, I successfully changed the DVD key and region
2315800	2318160	code of a 360, so it's all confirmed.
2318160	2321520	All I did towards this was to reverse the plain text KV signature to figure out how
2321520	2327320	to modify and re-sign the KV contents, but, okay, so, you know, hooray, now you might
2327320	2332040	be able to reverse your 360 to play games from other regions, but Microsoft will probably
2332040	2333560	close this loophole pretty soon.
2333560	2334560	They usually do.
2334560	2335560	I think they already have.
2335560	2341040	I think it's just on some of the older kernels they can do that.
2341040	2343920	The Rob D says, oh, that's all he did?
2343920	2345880	I can't believe I didn't think of that.
2345880	2350040	I think that might be a little more of that sarcasm thing somebody was referring to earlier
2350040	2351040	in the program.
2351040	2352040	I don't know.
2352040	2353040	Maybe.
2353040	2354040	All right.
2354040	2359120	And then Shadow Charlie says, brick, the Xbox 360's going to be a brick pretty soon.
2359120	2362760	They should just have a code in there when you try to do something like that and hack
2362760	2363760	it.
2363760	2366200	It'll just carve a nice little circle into your disk.
2366200	2372640	Like your Xbox 360 commits seppuku when it figures out that you're trying to, you know,
2372640	2374640	taint it.
2374640	2377800	That'd be funny.
2377800	2384160	Well, there is actually just a little bit more information that I have that some people
2384160	2385160	might be happy about.
2385160	2387520	Me, I don't really give two shits about.
2387520	2394520	But Far Cry 2 will be coming out.
2394520	2399560	I'm really, I don't know, I never played the first one enough to care about it.
2399560	2400560	I don't know anything about it.
2400560	2403440	I'm surprised that they did announce Far Cry 2 coming out, because I always thought Crisis
2403440	2407440	was Far Cry 2, and I guess I was wrong.
2407440	2410200	Doesn't it seem like it's been a long time since the first one came out?
2410200	2411200	2004, wasn't it?
2411200	2415040	Yeah, it just seems kind of weird that they would wait that long to announce a second
2415040	2416040	game.
2416040	2417940	Well, it's scheduled for a 2008 release.
2417940	2419360	Could it be the movie and all?
2419360	2422520	You want to tie a game that could possibly be good.
2422520	2423520	Right.
2423520	2424520	I'm just theorizing.
2424520	2425520	Jesus.
2425520	2430160	That's like if they would have promoted House of the Dead 3 in House of the Dead the movie
2430160	2431160	or something.
2431160	2432160	Should I tie that in?
2432160	2435800	Nobody would have played House of the Dead 3 at all.
2435800	2440480	No, I think, I don't know, it was a good first person shooter game.
2440480	2442960	I like how you can make your own levels and stuff in it.
2442960	2444540	That was kind of neat.
2444540	2447140	Just makes me miss time splitters even more.
2447140	2450520	So since Jamie and I both don't play Far Cry, you tell us, what would you want to see in
2450520	2453720	Far Cry 2?
2453720	2454720	I don't know.
2454720	2458240	I would like to see some of the stuff that they're showing off in Crisis, because Crisis
2458240	2464400	looks like such an amazing game, and Far Cry was pretty good when it came out originally.
2464400	2470600	Maybe some different settings, maybe not all in the jungle, I don't know, just improve
2470600	2471600	upon it.
2471600	2473880	It was a pretty good game to begin with.
2473880	2478440	Some of the AI though in the first game was a little weird, so maybe tune that up a bit,
2478440	2484560	but if the AI is good, and the game stays kind of how it was, it should be a pretty
2484560	2487080	good game.
2487080	2491200	If you don't have it on the 360, I'd recommend picking it up, because it's dirt cheap now
2491200	2493040	and it's actually pretty fun.
2493040	2495280	Alright, well, let's move on.
2495280	2498680	Any more stories before we open up the Skype line, which I believe is coming up very soon?
2498680	2502000	Yes, we got one, and it's kind of interesting.
2502000	2507100	Silicon Knights, they're actually going to be suing Epic over the Unreal 3 engine.
2507100	2514440	Apparently they've had some difficulties programming in it, and it's not performing as they had
2514440	2515440	hoped.
2515440	2520400	This is kind of stemming from the showing of 2Human at E3.
2520400	2527840	Apparently some people weren't too happy about it, but I don't know.
2527840	2531600	Should be interesting to see what's happening with it.
2531600	2534640	I know that they're not the only company that's been having trouble with it.
2534640	2540560	I know for the PlayStation 3 side, Koei has been having trouble with Fatal Inertia.
2540560	2546560	In fact, that game has been postponed indefinitely now.
2546560	2554200	So some problems arising with this fantastic engine that everybody's been licensing, maybe.
2554200	2556280	Is it just hard to work with?
2556280	2560560	They might just not have all of the documentation for it or something.
2560560	2564000	It sounds like they weren't getting everything they were promised, about this whole, like,
2564000	2567240	there's going to be an update in six months and then it never came or whatever.
2567240	2571680	But it's hard to say until we get the smoking gun publishing the full court papers so we
2571680	2572680	can read it for ourselves.
2572680	2573680	That'll be exciting.
2573680	2580600	DJ Jenai in our chat room says, Sue Epic for ditching One Must Fall 2097.
2580600	2583200	That's old school right there.
2583200	2585680	I love that game.
2585680	2589580	There was the One Must Fall Battlegrounds that came out, remember online, it was like
2589580	2592080	a battle arena game.
2592080	2594780	It's not over yet if you want to play that.
2594780	2595780	You never know.
2595780	2598720	All right, anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line now.
2598720	2605340	If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name is Orange
2605340	2606340	Lounge Radio.
2606340	2607340	Who would have thought?
2607340	2609920	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype is our user name.
2609920	2614360	And I also want to put out there that there is a brand new version of Skype available.
2614360	2617320	And this is our first night using it and they've changed the interface a little bit.
2617320	2622680	I don't anticipate any problems, but you never know what might go wrong here on the program.
2622680	2623960	So let's go to the phones.
2623960	2626240	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2626240	2627240	Who's this?
2627240	2628240	Raven's Dolphin.
2628240	2629240	How are you?
2629240	2630240	Good.
2630240	2632800	And I'm so happy that the phone picked up this time and we're not having those technical
2632800	2633800	difficulties.
2633800	2635240	What's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?
2635240	2636240	The Epic thing.
2636240	2640800	A lot of things are on my mind actually, but the Epic thing really.
2640800	2641800	What about the Epic thing?
2641800	2642800	The whole lawsuit?
2642800	2643800	Yeah.
2643800	2648000	Didn't Silicon Knights used to be like a Nintendo company?
2648000	2651080	Yes, according to Loki.
2651080	2652080	I don't know.
2652080	2654200	I haven't checked my Wikipedia.
2654200	2655200	Is that it?
2655200	2656200	Yeah.
2656200	2657200	Silicon Knights did Eternal Darkness.
2657200	2658200	Oh.
2658200	2663680	Okay, so what does that have to do with your opinion and everything?
2663680	2666680	Because now they're doing games for the 360 and PS3.
2666680	2671600	Do you find that Nintendo cut them loose and now they're doing too human and then they
2671600	2673880	try to get this engine?
2673880	2679760	It feels like they're a bunch of... You know how Epic has got this game that's really popular?
2679760	2682560	I feel like they're just trying to milk money out of them.
2682560	2684720	A bunch of people go, I can't get this to work.
2684720	2685720	Damn it.
2685720	2686720	Let's just sue them.
2686720	2690640	Well, that's not just the sue part, but as far as the company making games for other
2690640	2693000	companies, that's what you got to do to make money.
2693000	2697360	If you don't have an exclusive agreement with one anymore, you make games for wherever you
2697360	2698680	think you can sell them.
2698680	2704520	Yeah, and they're trying to make a whole new engine, so I wish them luck with that.
2704520	2706320	You're getting some agreement from our chat room.
2706320	2709480	Rob D says, I actually agree with Raven's Dolphin.
2709480	2712640	Like he's never agreed with you before, so there you go.
2712640	2713640	That's a first.
2713640	2714640	That's a first.
2714640	2717720	All right, and DJ Genai says Epic has a big ego too.
2717720	2722200	They do, but they do make good games, but it feels like... I'm playing Rainbow Six,
2722200	2726280	which is an Unreal Tournament game, an Unreal technology game, and it works fine.
2726280	2727880	I don't know what they're doing.
2727880	2732160	Sephiroth1215 says they weren't really a Nintendo developer, they just made all the games on
2732160	2733160	GameCube.
2733160	2734160	Okay.
2734160	2736760	All right, well what else is on your mind?
2736760	2738420	What else is on my mind?
2738420	2743120	The Wii board, you said that the Wii snowboard... Not the snowboard, the Wii Fit board.
2743120	2745840	Fit board could be used as a snowboard, I suppose, in a game.
2745840	2747600	Yeah, this is what I was thinking about.
2747600	2748600	Remember 1080?
2748600	2749600	Yeah.
2749600	2756240	Okay, wouldn't that be the hottest thing if they put 1080 on the Wii Fit board?
2756240	2762520	Or tricky, SSX tricky, with that theme song I can never get out of my head.
2762520	2763520	It's tricky.
2763520	2764520	Yeah.
2764520	2766160	I can't wait for that.
2766160	2769120	Blaze agrees with you in chat, 1080 for the win.
2769120	2772440	So you think they could do more types of games than just fitness games and mini games with
2772440	2773440	this board?
2773440	2774440	Snowboarding.
2774440	2775440	I really do.
2775440	2779240	Like the next Tony Hawk and the 1080 game, I would cream my pants for that.
2779240	2780720	I'm a real snowboarding fan.
2780720	2783520	I don't like sports games, but I love snowboarding games.
2783520	2788440	How do you think they would do this whole Square Enix is saying they want to license
2788440	2789560	the thing?
2789560	2793960	What kind of Square Enix game do you think would incorporate the Wii Fit board?
2793960	2795160	I've been thinking about it.
2795160	2796160	I don't know.
2796160	2798440	It would probably be a Final Fantasy kind of like ripoff game.
2798440	2799440	I don't know.
2799440	2803040	I don't think the kind of like Final Fantasy aerobic game going like, yeah, step on the
2803040	2808720	board, yeah, cast a spell, yeah, do this.
2808720	2814440	Maybe it would be Final Fantasy X-3 or something where, you know, the Yuna's Angels, you know,
2814440	2817960	you can actually do a little dance on the Wii Fit board and change into different outfits.
2817960	2818960	It would be fun.
2818960	2820960	Doesn't that sound like fun?
2820960	2823840	That does sound like fun, but I'm really excited, you know.
2823840	2825960	I'm not going to pass judgment on the board yet.
2825960	2829320	Well, and you shouldn't until you get to play it, because a lot of people pass judgment
2829320	2831840	on the Wii, but change their minds when they actually get to play it.
2831840	2833080	Oh, one last thing.
2833080	2835040	You don't sound like Vodafin anymore.
2835040	2836040	Good for you.
2836040	2837240	I don't sound like what?
2837240	2839440	You don't sound like you're on Vonage at all.
2839440	2840880	That might be the new Skype.
2840880	2843600	I think the quality has increased slightly, so.
2843600	2844600	What's a Vodge?
2844600	2846600	Why am I so loud?
2846600	2848840	A Vodge is what a lady has between...
2848840	2849840	I thought he said Vodge.
2849840	2850840	I was like, what the crap?
2850840	2852840	It doesn't sound like you're on that, I guess.
2852840	2853840	Vonage.
2853840	2854840	Vonage.
2854840	2856560	No, a Vodge is something completely different.
2856560	2858840	No, I said, I had a D when I said it.
2858840	2859840	Vodge.
2859840	2860840	A Vodge is where the babies come from.
2860840	2863200	And then you shake them.
2863200	2864200	Stop it.
2864200	2865200	All right.
2865200	2867120	I got to go, so you can pick up some more calls.
2867120	2868120	All right, you got it, Ravis Dolphin.
2868120	2869120	Talk to you later.
2869120	2871680	I think I made him uncomfortable.
2871680	2872680	I think you did.
2872680	2873680	That was fun.
2873680	2874680	Let's do it again.
2874680	2875680	Do it again?
2875680	2876680	Make him uncomfortable again?
2876680	2878680	I want to make somebody else uncomfortable.
2878680	2879680	All right.
2879680	2880680	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2880680	2881680	Who's this?
2881680	2882880	Hi, GS68.
2882880	2885800	Hi GS68, what's on your mind?
2885800	2890360	You know how you said Maximum 2 and 3 will come out along with Long Gun Midnight for
2890360	2891360	the PS3, right?
2891360	2894200	I did, and I bet you're calling in to correct me, huh?
2894200	2895200	Yeah.
2895200	2896200	All right, what's up?
2896200	2900960	There's already a few Maximum 2 and 3 machines in Northern California.
2900960	2901960	Well, that's...
2901960	2906240	But, okay, so it's not simultaneous, but it's been about the same time, right?
2906240	2908820	Yeah, there's already a machine in Hayward.
2908820	2909820	How is it?
2909820	2910820	I haven't played it yet.
2910820	2913000	Actually, I haven't tried it yet.
2913000	2917000	I'm just waiting for Sanibel Golf Land and Milpitas Golf Land to get it.
2917000	2921240	Ah, so some of the local golf lands, sure, and then, you know, it's a big chain.
2921240	2922680	They get a lot of the hottest games.
2922680	2923680	Why not?
2923680	2924680	Yeah, let me just post...
2924680	2926680	I'm going to post a link in chat room, so...
2926680	2927680	All right.
2927680	2928680	Just so you all know.
2928680	2930400	I am planning on buying it, though.
2930400	2931400	I think I've decided.
2931400	2932720	You think you are going to import it?
2932720	2933720	You know why I checked out first?
2933720	2934720	Yeah, because...
2934720	2938000	Well, because I just, you know, I only have like one game for the PS3 now, and it'd be
2938000	2939240	cool to have an import game.
2939240	2940240	Yeah, it might be fun.
2940240	2943400	Although, it's not going to be fun if you buy the thing, and then the damn thing doesn't
2943400	2944400	work.
2944400	2945400	That's going to suck.
2945400	2946400	It's region-free.
2946400	2947400	All right.
2947400	2948400	All the games are region-free now.
2948400	2949400	Can I come over and play?
2949400	2950400	Yeah.
2950400	2951400	Tell him no.
2951400	2953040	GS68, do you know if the soundtrack on the third one is as cool as the second one?
2953040	2954760	Like, did Yuzo Koshiro do it again?
2954760	2960180	I don't know yet, but from what I've read, you pick between the Maximum 2 1 and 2 soundtrack
2960180	2966920	and the new Maximum 2 and 3 soundtrack, and then if you transfer a certain kind of card,
2966920	2972800	you can get a special soundtrack that's from an earlier Wongdon Midnight game.
2972800	2973800	That's cool.
2973800	2975680	Now, I just got disconnected from chat, so I missed your link.
2975680	2976680	Post it again.
2976680	2977680	Stupid chat.
2977680	2985280	Actually, someone just said that you have to register to see it.
2985280	2987240	It's one of those forums where you have to register to see any...
2987240	2990240	Give out your registration information.
2990240	2991560	Is it on bug me not?
2991560	2992560	All right.
2992560	2994120	No, it's fine.
2994120	2996480	I'll wait for the information to hit Wikipedia.
2996480	2997480	It's all good.
2997480	2998480	Okay.
2998480	2999480	All right.
2999480	3000480	Well, thanks for the correction.
3000480	3001480	Appreciate it.
3001480	3002480	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3002480	3003480	No, I'm good.
3003480	3004480	All right.
3004480	3005480	All right.
3005480	3007480	Well, then we'll talk to you later, my friend.
3007480	3008480	All right.
3008480	3009480	Take care.
3009480	3010480	All right.
3010480	3011480	You too.
3011480	3012480	Bye-bye.
3012480	3013480	All right.
3013480	3014480	We'll go back to the phones.
3014480	3020520	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,
3020520	3022600	and hopefully we can actually answer the calls tonight.
3022600	3025620	Again, we've upgraded to a new version of Skype, and it's taken a little bit of getting
3025620	3026620	used to.
3026620	3028360	I want these little floating windows to go away.
3028360	3029360	I don't like that.
3029360	3031200	Those need to go away.
3031200	3032200	Shake them.
3032200	3033200	Maybe it'll work.
3033200	3034200	Stop it.
3034200	3035200	Why am I so loud?
3035200	3036200	I don't know.
3036200	3037200	Hi.
3037200	3038200	Oh, snap.
3038200	3039200	Hello.
3039200	3040200	Oh, snap.
3040200	3041200	Hi.
3041200	3042200	Hi.
3042200	3043200	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3043200	3044200	Who's this?
3044200	3045200	Legend of Zaku.
3045200	3046200	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
3046200	3047200	What's on your mind?
3047200	3048200	Nah, nothing much.
3048200	3049200	Just trying to chill this weekend.
3049200	3052040	Just going through the trauma of DDR Freak, but that's another story.
3052040	3054320	Wait, the trauma of DDR Freak?
3054320	3055600	Drama, I said.
3055600	3056600	The drama.
3056600	3057600	What else is new?
3057600	3058600	Why haven't you left?
3058600	3059600	Why do you think I only moderate two forums?
3059600	3061720	No, it has nothing to do with the general populace.
3061720	3067240	It's just within our city and digital life this year.
3067240	3068240	We like drama.
3068240	3070920	What's up with digital life this year?
3070920	3082840	The rules, basically how folks are chastising, they're just having arguments over the rules
3082840	3087720	this year instead of having a point system for every mod, they actually got adapted two
3087720	3089980	out of three, straight perfect attack.
3089980	3093720	I'm just going to ask you straight up, are the rules bullshit this year, Zaku?
3093720	3094720	Not really.
3094720	3095720	They're straight four.
3095720	3102600	As I said, straight PA match, two out of three shuffle I believe will be on at all times
3102600	3108920	with left and right, but yeah, it's a far cry from last year's challenge point system
3108920	3112000	where every mod they used would just get you extra points.
3112000	3114340	When is digital life this year?
3114340	3115480	At the end of September.
3115480	3118080	You know I have a credit with JetBlue, I might be able to come back.
3118080	3119080	Oh really?
3119080	3123440	Yes, something happened with JetBlue last time I have a credit.
3123440	3125760	27th through 30th.
3125760	3129800	Thinking about it, because I know I'd have a place to stay if I went, so we'll see.
3129800	3131680	No, that's cool.
3131680	3133720	Think about it.
3133720	3134720	You already know Don, right?
3134720	3135720	You know frequency.
3135720	3136720	Yep.
3136720	3141680	Let him know, since he's running the tournament, he might be able to hook you up with space
3141680	3147560	within the booth, perhaps, so he can set up his solo.
3147560	3151800	I will give it some serious consideration after I get past this move stuff.
3151800	3153160	I would love to go to digital life.
3153160	3156540	I keep hearing about it and I never get to go, so maybe.
3156540	3159560	Hopefully this year will be better than last.
3159560	3166200	Besides all the drama, these new rules hopefully, from what I've been hearing, will draw most
3166200	3169920	of the good players from the country.
3169920	3170920	What is he giving away?
3170920	3171920	He's giving away a big prize.
3171920	3172920	He's giving away the DDR tournament this year.
3172920	3173920	Three grand.
3173920	3174920	Huh?
3174920	3175920	Three grand for expert division.
3175920	3176920	Shit.
3176920	3177920	Three grand?
3177920	3178920	I might want to enter that.
3178920	3179920	My God.
3179920	3180920	And I think 1,500 for freestyle.
3180920	3181920	Oh my God.
3181920	3182920	1,500 bucks for freestyle?
3182920	3184520	You know the price is regular.
3184520	3188160	You could totally get a new PS3 with that, and that's it.
3188160	3190720	I could pay off some credit card bills with that.
3190720	3191720	Come on.
3191720	3192720	What are you talking about?
3192720	3193720	That's great.
3193720	3194720	I'll have to think about that.
3194720	3195720	Maybe I should come up with a new freestyle.
3195720	3201720	Wouldn't you like to see my freestyle, Zaku?
3201720	3202720	I don't know.
3202720	3203720	I'm trying to think right now.
3203720	3209640	I do want to do a routine this year, but I might be looking for another for a partner
3209640	3213120	maybe, and I want to do a solo, like last year where I fucked it up.
3213120	3214120	I'll think about it.
3214120	3215120	You know what?
3215120	3217880	I'll give Dr. Dick a call and see if he wants to do a freestyle for 1,500 because that might
3217880	3218880	bring him out of hiding.
3218880	3224120	Oh yeah, and then you'll be up against all the other folks from within the city and possibly
3224120	3225120	the country.
3225120	3226120	Yeah, we'll see.
3226120	3227120	All right, Zaku.
3227120	3229600	Anything else you want to share with the listeners?
3229600	3236320	Pretty much just have the rant about certain stores just jacking up the prices on old school
3236320	3237320	stuff.
3237320	3243000	Like the store in the Village that I know, they have the gold to mark up $40 for a copy
3243000	3246720	of Punch Out, Mike Tyson's Punch Out.
3246720	3250400	I wonder if that's that same store I got taken to because they had some really expensive
3250400	3251400	stuff.
3251400	3252400	Yeah, that's Video Games New York.
3252400	3253400	Yeah.
3253400	3259800	But the thing is that I managed to find a $15 copy in a flea market in Coney Island.
3259800	3261100	It's all about where you look.
3261100	3262100	It's all about looking.
3262100	3263100	That type of stuff.
3263100	3264100	I know.
3264100	3265100	I could probably go to the farmer's market here and get similar deals.
3265100	3266100	All right, Zaku.
3266100	3267100	We've got to let you go.
3267100	3268100	But have a good one, okay?
3268100	3269100	All right.
3269100	3270100	And maybe see you at Digital Life.
3270100	3271100	Maybe.
3271100	3272100	All right.
3272100	3273100	We'll look forward to that.
3273100	3274100	I hope so.
3274100	3275100	We'll see you.
3275100	3276100	Bye.
3276100	3277100	Peace.
3277100	3278100	Now I'm really tempted to go because you all know I love New York City and I do have
3278100	3280720	a credit on JetBlue I have to use within a year.
3280720	3281720	So maybe.
3281720	3283720	Ooh, I'm so tempted.
3283720	3284720	We'll see.
3284720	3285720	Let's see if we get any more calls.
3285720	3290480	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE RADIO but the phones haven't
3290480	3291480	been ringing that much tonight.
3291480	3292840	I guess you all don't have much to say.
3292840	3296440	I guess we'll go around and ask if there's any last minute stories.
3296440	3297440	No.
3297440	3298440	No?
3298440	3300720	Loki, you have anything tonight?
3300720	3301920	Yeah.
3301920	3309040	As I mentioned earlier, all those rumors from Sony end up becoming true and here's a little
3309040	3314480	bit of something else we were talking about earlier, how the whole rumbling of the 6-axis
3314480	3318320	and stuff is coming sooner than later.
3318320	3329400	Anyways, Kaz Horizon actually admitted that the 6-axis is not the final PlayStation 3
3329400	3330400	controller.
3330400	3331400	Surprise.
3331400	3336560	And that they're working with Immersion on Rumble and there's also rumors I guess
3336560	3344200	about Immersion's touch-sensitive technology which might be touch-sensitive stuff.
3344200	3346320	Goodie.
3346320	3347760	Other interesting things.
3347760	3351040	Let's see here.
3351040	3357560	There's a DOA toy that you can buy out there now that you can actually remove the clothing
3357560	3358840	off of.
3358840	3360680	Oh, hooray.
3360680	3364660	As if you need an excuse to buy those.
3364660	3365660	Let's see.
3365660	3374120	Now, you may remember Sonic and Mario at the Olympics is going to come out later this year.
3374120	3377460	Also though, that's not the only Olympics games being released.
3377460	3382040	In the UK, Asterix at the Olympics is also going to be making its way out there.
3382040	3386800	So that should be pretty interesting.
3386800	3389920	And then this one also looks very interesting to me.
3389920	3398320	The DJ Maxx developers are announcing a brand new PSP shooter game called S4 Portable.
3398320	3405120	And no word on, it's a stylish shooting sports game I guess.
3405120	3409840	And it's also going to feature some of the characters from DJ Maxx in it as well.
3409840	3410840	So that's pretty awesome.
3410840	3412960	Come on and be Rangers.
3412960	3415680	They're so cool.
3415680	3422600	Another thing, Project Anthem Racing 4 actually has the ability to save every single race
3422600	3423800	that everybody does.
3423800	3427760	They're actually going to have a database online where you can upload every single race
3427760	3428760	you race.
3428760	3431560	Is that like what they do for Halo?
3431560	3433760	Possibly.
3433760	3437120	Very interesting.
3437120	3439120	Quick comments from chatroom on these various stories.
3439120	3443200	GS68 agrees the NB Rangers are awesome.
3443200	3445920	So GS68 wants to know about the Dead or Alive figures.
3445920	3447440	Does it have jiggleable boobs?
3447440	3450200	No, it doesn't really make them fully naked.
3450200	3453300	You can just take them down the broad in panties I guess.
3453300	3454460	This is interesting.
3454460	3460740	Next week we're going to get Wing Commander Arena on Xbox Live Arcade for 800 points.
3460740	3461740	Not interested.
3461740	3462740	Sorry.
3462740	3464160	I used to love Wing Commander.
3464160	3469180	If it was original Wing Commander I'd be sold.
3469180	3471020	And this I'd like to plug real quick.
3471020	3477880	It's a PSP IRC version 1.01 and it's an IRC client for the PSP.
3477880	3482040	In fact, earlier today I was using it in the chatroom and it works pretty good.
3482040	3488240	It works on a firmware 1.5 as well as those custom firmwares out there.
3488240	3489320	So check it out.
3489320	3493640	It does support an IR keyboard as well if you happen to have one of those.
3493640	3495000	I didn't.
3495000	3499160	But they apparently have tested it with the Targis universal IR wireless keyboard.
3499160	3502200	I guess it's used for PDAs.
3502200	3505720	But if you don't have that there's another text entry method that's a little bit slower
3505720	3507000	but still you can do it.
3507000	3509900	It's pretty easy.
3509900	3516760	And then real quick, there's an interesting rumor going around that Manhunt 2 might be
3516760	3524560	published by Nintendo or published for the Nintendo Wii despite the AO rating.
3524560	3530560	It's coming from gonintendo.com but no word if that's been confirmed yet or not.
3530560	3534600	Well I have one last minute story that was sent to me from Tigerclaw in chat and it's
3534600	3540840	a story that comes from gizmodo.com and it has to do with how a gang of folks actually
3540840	3547040	kidnapped a gamer to get his password using a date request on Orkut.
3547040	3548960	This is crazy.
3548960	3550740	This again is coming from gizmodo.com.
3550740	3554560	An armed gang of four kidnapped one of the world's top RPG gamers after one criminal's
3554560	3557740	girlfriend lured him into a fake date using Orkut.
3557740	3559560	That's Google's social network by the way.
3559560	3563680	After sequestering him in Sao Paulo they held a gun against the victim's head for five hours
3563680	3567820	to get his password which they wanted to sell for $8,000.
3567820	3570200	After five hours the hostage wasn't talking.
3570200	3573720	The group leader had a gun against his head at all that time but the guy didn't say a
3573720	3574720	word.
3574720	3576400	Finally the crooks gave up and decided to let him go.
3576400	3580200	The Brazilian police then caught the four suspects aged 19, 27.
3580200	3585480	According to police the captive was the world leader in Gunbound is who they kidnapped.
3585480	3589320	That was the world leader in Gunbound and of course you guys probably know about this
3589320	3590320	game.
3590320	3591320	You've probably heard of it.
3591320	3595200	Have some friends that play it and so this guy's like the world leader and so the game
3595200	3600480	is so popular these gangsters decided to make some quick money off of it by sending him
3600480	3604480	an online date through Orkut and then kidnapping him instead.
3604480	3605480	Crazy.
3605480	3607820	There you go.
3607820	3610320	I like how they gave up.
3610320	3611320	I know.
3611320	3612320	It's kind of interesting.
3612320	3613320	Eh, forget it.
3613320	3614320	Wow.
3614320	3619480	GS68 says gold farming is serious fucking business.
3619480	3621040	Frisbee says tell me your fucking password.
3621040	3623000	That must have been a very interesting conversation.
3623000	3625520	That would be like an interesting movie plot.
3625520	3628880	GS68 says I should start on Gunbound.
3628880	3631560	Why would that story make you want to start playing Gunbound?
3631560	3632560	Ugh.
3632560	3633560	Alright.
3633560	3638560	Well, that's going to do it with the Skype line, I wasn't really ringing in any more
3638560	3639560	calls.
3639560	3642880	So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight and to do that we have to go around
3642880	3645000	and get everybody's final thoughts.
3645000	3647600	Miklotov, thank you so much for being here this week.
3647600	3649120	I stayed through the whole thing.
3649120	3650120	You really did.
3650120	3651120	I'm very impressed.
3651120	3652120	That's the first time in months.
3652120	3655000	And now you're not going to catch your train to go home.
3655000	3656000	It's 834.
3656000	3657000	Gosh dang it.
3657000	3658000	It's alright.
3658000	3660480	Can I do an FUs real quick?
3660480	3661480	No.
3661480	3662480	Dang it.
3662480	3663480	Alright, but thank you for being here.
3663480	3664480	You're welcome.
3664480	3666600	Thank you for making me lose money.
3666600	3667600	Sorry.
3667600	3669720	Any final thoughts?
3669720	3673420	I love Survivor a lot.
3673420	3674800	You're so going to get voted out.
3674800	3675800	I don't care.
3675800	3676800	I'm having fun.
3676800	3677800	Alright.
3677800	3680160	Loki, your final thought?
3680160	3681160	I don't know.
3681160	3686360	I kind of want to play this Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 3 game.
3686360	3688360	Looks fun.
3688360	3689360	It better be fun.
3689360	3690360	It's expensive.
3690360	3691360	Alright.
3691360	3697000	And, Jamie, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?
3697000	3700320	Uh, what?
3700320	3701600	That's your final thought is what?
3701600	3702600	What?
3702600	3703600	What?
3703600	3704600	What?
3704600	3705600	Alright.
3705600	3708360	Do they speak English and what?
3708360	3714920	And I also have a final thought for tonight.
3714920	3716800	My vote tonight is for Shane.
3716800	3717800	What?
3717800	3722040	Shane, you're a real fucking duplicitous asshole and you were plotting against me in the very
3722040	3723880	beginning of this game.
3723880	3726560	That you must leave the island tonight.
3726560	3727560	Whatever.
3727560	3728560	I win.
3728560	3729560	Take that.
3729560	3730560	Alright.
3730560	3736320	Anyway, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting
