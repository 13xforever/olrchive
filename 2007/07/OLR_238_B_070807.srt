00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:20,187
[SPEAKER_10]: E3's going on!

3
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:44,369
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, as we talked about in Part A, one of the things that Sony is most likely going to be announcing at E3 is a $100 price drop for the PlayStation 3.

4
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:50,971
[SPEAKER_10]: However, as we do record the show live on Sunday nights, sometimes things change as the show is going on.

5
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:51,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Loki?

6
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:53,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's not a secret anymore.

7
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:55,293
[SPEAKER_08]: It is official.

8
00:00:55,733 --> 00:01:02,756
[SPEAKER_08]: They have announced that the PlayStation 3 will be dropping, or I should say the PlayStation 3 68 system will be dropping to $499.

9
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:05,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, actually this week.

10
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:15,285
[SPEAKER_08]: The other announcement, though, is coming in August, they're going to be releasing the 80 gig model that's going to be also bundled with a retail copy of Motorstorm.

11
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:18,787
[SPEAKER_08]: That is going to be at the $5.99 price point.

12
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:22,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, everybody loves that $5.99 price point.

13
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,252
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least it's nice to see that they're bundling a game in there as well.

14
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:27,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

15
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:31,695
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit more for your money, but still, not a whole lot.

16
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:38,474
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably going to be announced again at E3 and during Sony's so-called press conference.

17
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:41,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Just thought we'd like to let you guys know about that.

18
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:43,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Now on to other things.

19
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:59,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course with E3 right around the corner, one thing that we loved last year, and they're doing it again, is Microsoft is going to be doing that Bring It Home thing where they actually have videos and demos from the show floor almost.

20
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:00,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year we got to play

21
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:03,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Test Drive Unlimited, and MotoGP 2006.

22
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:07,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was one other one in there.

23
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:07,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

24
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:08,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun stuff.

25
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:19,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So this year, though, who knows what we're going to get, but we're going to get more of that, more demos, more game trailers and stuff like that, more free themes, hopefully.

26
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:20,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

27
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, they're not the only ones doing that.

28
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:30,845
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, Sony is jumping on the bandwagon, so they say, and are going to be doing something very similar on the PlayStation Network as well.

29
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:34,647
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have downloadable demos and videos and whatnot.

30
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So, awesome.

31
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:40,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to download new demos because I like playing demos.

32
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:47,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think, and just indulge me here as silly as this thought might be, do you think that Microsoft might pull out a price drop of their own?

33
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:49,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly.

34
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:50,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly.

35
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:54,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I, they're not gonna just be like, do-do-do-do-do, you know, whatever.

36
00:02:54,734 --> 00:03:09,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they need to, but, you know, now that Sony dropped their price, they might pull that thing where, where we think that our price point, you know, even though it's, it's $399, is still competitive with their price point, but they might be going by the leads, still, even though their leads are $20 less, supposedly.

37
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:09,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

38
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:15,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think they might throw in a free game or something to make the deal more lucrative?

39
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:55,901
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt says not till after Halo 3 comes out would there be another price drop they very well might hold it off until after Halo comes out and just say boom here you go price drop let's sell some systems

40
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:57,362
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:21,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Eternal Sonata had a demo come out already but Blue Dragon will be getting a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace July 20th.

42
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:31,780
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a Dengeki Online magazine in Japan that is claiming that a 1.1 gigabyte demo is going to be coming out over here in the US on July 20th.

43
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,541
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a two hour demo if this story is correct.

44
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:37,742
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a pretty intense demo.

45
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:41,003
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only going to be available though for two weeks.

46
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,003
[SPEAKER_10]: The demo will disappear on August 3rd.

47
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:44,564
[SPEAKER_10]: So now it almost sounds like it's like a

48
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Beta test or something, even though it's not an online game, so I don't know what the hell else to call it.

49
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:50,794
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a limited time demo.

50
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:51,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of interesting.

51
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:56,379
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just an incentive for you to play it, I guess.

52
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,760
[SPEAKER_08]: But a two hour demo?

53
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

54
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:03,866
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like a really good idea, especially if the game is going to be a bunch longer than that.

55
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:08,350
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're trying to give a percentage of the game to get an idea of it.

56
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,933
[SPEAKER_08]: It is supposed to be one of the first Xbox 360 games that's on two discs.

57
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:13,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

58
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:21,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and you know, and then I also think about, you know, your typical Xbox early adopter is not someone who's typically into these type of Japanese RPGs.

59
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:29,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, a lot of folks who have not picked up an Xbox 360 still, they do like these games and aren't impressed with the fact that Microsoft doesn't have them out.

60
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:38,256
[SPEAKER_10]: But maybe having a very long two-hour demo is kind of a way to show these folks who maybe bought their Xboxes for the Maddens and burnouts of the world.

61
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Give them their really first experience in a Japanese RPG and try to get some people sucked into the world through that.

62
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:45,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, just a thought.

63
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:57,477
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, to kind of go back a little bit, with the whole PlayStation Network doing almost like the bring it home thing, I really do hope they do this because lately their downloads and stuff and their content online has been pretty crappy.

64
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:05,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and if they start kicking it up to maybe the Xbox Live level, that would be pretty awesome and that would definitely help them.

65
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:12,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know right now the 360, there's no shortage of new demos and games coming out each week.

66
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:21,329
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, I will definitely be looking forward to the Blue Dragon demo, and I'll be downloading it, I'm sure, as a lot of you folks listening to the show will be.

67
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:34,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of Xbox news, the Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be launched in Japan on October 11th.

68
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:41,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And the price is going to be 47,800 yen, which in US dollars is 390.

69
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:44,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're getting it cheaper than we did.

70
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for them, I guess.

71
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess they need to be selling more Xboxes over in Japan, so why not release it cheap, eh?

72
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:52,744
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying.

73
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:53,825
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

74
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:58,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you're in Japan and you've been holding out for an Xbox 360, maybe now's the time.

75
00:06:58,369 --> 00:06:58,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

76
00:06:59,570 --> 00:06:59,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

77
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,357
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

78
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:28,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the only problem, though, is the PlayStation 3 version has been delayed indefinitely.

79
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:34,211
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the Xbox 360 one will be arriving September 11th on my birthday.

80
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:34,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

81
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:41,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And PlayStation 3 will possibly later on if it's not cancelled by then.

82
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:43,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

83
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's been plenty of games like this.

84
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Splinter Cell, Double Agent, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, hell, Rainbow Six Vegas.

85
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:52,426
[SPEAKER_08]: It

86
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:56,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kind of continuing the trend that the PlayStation 3 is hard to develop for.

87
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:04,998
[SPEAKER_10]: This is very interesting, kind of taking another topic here from Xbox 360 World.

88
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:09,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Forza 2, you can create your own cars in Forza 2, right?

89
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:14,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can create these cars and you can actually sell them in their little online auction.

90
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:17,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm surprised it took this long for a story like this to come out.

91
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:18,554
[SPEAKER_10]: www.DarkSakura.com

92
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,010
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:08:57,256 --> 00:09:00,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Not, you know, a giant twat on the hood of a car or something.

94
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:01,737
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all sorts of offensive things.

95
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:04,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck me in the butt, like written on the side of the car.

96
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:08,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is just the tip of the iceberg, folks.

97
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:11,819
[SPEAKER_10]: So how exactly do you stop this from happening?

98
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:14,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Does a set of eyes have to look at every car that goes up?

99
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:20,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you just allow this kind of shit to go on there and hope that people will warn or whatever they need to do?

100
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,581
[SPEAKER_08]: What you need to do is they should have something, you know, report abuse or report, you know,

101
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,168
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a fence, you know, something like that.

102
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:33,749
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if it's, do you think if it's breaking, you know, the terms of service or whatever, have it be reported and then they can take it down.

103
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:35,290
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, kind of like eBay.

104
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:45,232
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and of course, Microsoft has their whole little online user policy that says you won't use our services to discriminate against, you know, somebody for a race or whatever.

105
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:54,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though whenever you sign on to Xbox Live and you play some online game, it's usually, you know, NNNNFFFF and all those, you know, words getting dropped everywhere.

106
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Like crazy.

107
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:03,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of the charm, and I say that with over sarcasm there, the charm of Xbox Live.

108
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:05,315
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I only play Xbox Live with friends.

109
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I very rarely will play Xbox Live with strangers.

110
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:09,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And I rate every single one of them too.

111
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:12,119
[SPEAKER_10]: If I play Xbox Live with strangers, they get rated by me.

112
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:12,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time.

113
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,160
[SPEAKER_10]: I rate them good or I rate them bad.

114
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:22,764
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be interesting to see if Sony, what Sony does in their whole future plan for online gaming as well.

115
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:26,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, other stuff.

116
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:27,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

117
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:28,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

118
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Other stuff has to do with Gears of War, the soundtrack.

119
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:45,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the game is so popular that they are releasing the score to the game on soundtrack, you know, with tracks such as Train Ride to Hell.

120
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:53,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, if I'd known there were more songs like that in Gears of War, I might have tried to play it longer, although it was kind of frustrating me like crazy.

121
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:55,222
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

122
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:58,465
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been doing soundtracks to video games for years in Japan.

123
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just now getting all this goodness.

124
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:02,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Just in recent years.

125
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:03,909
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had some.

126
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:05,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you'll get, like, spotty, really.

127
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, Gran Turismo 2 had a soundtrack.

128
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:07,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember that.

129
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:09,674
[SPEAKER_06]: We do get the Silent Hill soundtracks over here.

130
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:12,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're very spotty, but you see them once in a while.

131
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:19,101
[SPEAKER_10]: But, of course, I think in Japan, my God, like, every role-playing game that's major come out of there has a deluxe soundtrack that comes out five disc long.

132
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:20,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Chrono Trigger soundtrack.

133
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:23,382
[SPEAKER_06]: With art books attached to them, like my Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack.

134
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:27,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of interesting that over here you get a Gears of War soundtrack.

135
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:29,004
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, the game's still insanely popular.

136
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:30,265
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always in that top ten list.

137
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:31,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that they're doing this, though.

138
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:32,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

139
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,186
[SPEAKER_06]: There's games come out where I'd be like, well, I really want the music to this.

140
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:40,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I've actually got the new whatever Mana game just came out soundtrack.

141
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:45,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Or how about like Grand Theft Auto, you know, Vice City.

142
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,851
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was all like actual, you know, radio music.

143
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,922
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sad that they never came out with a box set for Grand Theft Auto 3.

144
00:11:51,982 --> 00:11:56,005
[SPEAKER_08]: That had some pretty good stuff, especially on that techno trance station that they had on there.

145
00:11:56,606 --> 00:12:01,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that iTunes also opens the doors for a lot of this, too, because there's more and more game music on iTunes lately.

146
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:11,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we had a story a few weeks ago about how Konami put a lot of their old classic songs up there, so it's kind of neat what you can find online and shopping online as well.

147
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

148
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:38,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody got a response back from Microsoft saying that the surge protector was the cause of the Red Rings of Death.

149
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:43,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason, because the 360 is highly sensitive to reductions in power.

150
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the slightest cut in power can cause things like the fans and DVD laser to malfunction.

151
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:58,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Surge protectors can cause this, and probably 90% of the consoles they've seen fail in the 6-12 months of being plugged into a surge protector.

152
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:00,902
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

153
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Microsoft's response to the whole Red Rings of Death thing.

154
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:31,886
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, a game.

155
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:32,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's play a game.

156
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:36,587
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit of a slow news week, thanks to E3 being right around the corner.

157
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:40,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there has been some big news this week as things start to leak out before E3.

158
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,749
[SPEAKER_10]: But during a slow news week, we like to play a game.

159
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So tonight, we're going to play a little bit of Listless.

160
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:47,991
Listless

161
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:55,062
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way that listless works, you guys, we're going to be creating the definitive list around a certain topic.

162
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,483
[SPEAKER_10]: And the three hosts here in studio are going to play.

163
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:58,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jonas is here with us.

164
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:03,665
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't heard a lot from him this segment, but he's been sitting here in studio with us, joined us during Part A. He's here with us.

165
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:04,626
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you doing, Jonas?

166
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:05,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Doing fine, and you?

167
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:06,267
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, very good.

168
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Explicit, also known as in the online world.

169
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:10,168
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're going to be going to SAC Anime this weekend, too.

170
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, of course.

171
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:15,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Talk to you guys about SakAnime, I'm not sure if you guys are going to be able to make it.

172
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,514
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be there, we don't know about the panel yet though, so let us know.

173
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:20,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try my best to get you to get the panel there.

174
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:25,778
[SPEAKER_10]: For the whole three people in Sacramento to listen to this program, because this is a worldwide show, but we're hoping to get more, that's why we're going.

175
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I can help promote this stuff.

176
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, sounds awesome.

177
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:38,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well anyway, we'll talk about that later, but tonight we're going to talk about Listless, and tonight's topic is the most random thing we'd like to see at E3 this year.

178
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:38,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

179
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:40,124
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how it's going to work.

180
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:44,869
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do serious things, crazy things, stupid things.

181
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,391
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no limitation.

182
00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:48,112
[SPEAKER_10]: You can be serious, you can be stupid.

183
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:51,416
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter because ultimately it will be in the hands of the chatroom.

184
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:56,341
[SPEAKER_10]: The way this is going to work, I will name my top three, as will DarkSakura, Loki, and Exquisite.

185
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:00,227
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be anything.

186
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:04,471
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be an event, something that happens at a press conference, or it could be a game that's announced or whatever.

187
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:09,656
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, chat room, if you'd like to make some suggestions, you can start yelling those out in chat.

188
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:15,601
[SPEAKER_10]: But chat, you will actually play an important part because once we name our three lists, then the fun part comes.

189
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:19,705
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go around and each one of us will take something off of the list.

190
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:22,147
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's going to leave us with a list of eight.

191
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,070
[SPEAKER_10]: In chat room, you're going to vote for your favorites.

192
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:28,670
[SPEAKER_10]: and we will come up with a definitive list based on the chat room vote.

193
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,791
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how Listless works.

194
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:34,193
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an old game we used to do years ago on my college radio show.

195
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,293
[SPEAKER_10]: It's lasted this long.

196
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:41,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, so again the topic tonight, the most random thing we'd like to see at E3 this year.

197
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:41,957
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

198
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:46,299
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be serious, stupid, whatever you want because the chat room will ultimately decide what it's going to be.

199
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:47,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's start it off.

200
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:49,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Explicit, you're our guest tonight.

201
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you start us off?

202
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,682
[SPEAKER_10]: What would be the third most random thing you'd like to see at E3 this year?

203
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Bill Gates getting pied in the face?

204
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, that's happened before, okay.

205
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,555
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know how everyone's talking about the red rings of death.

206
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:25,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so you think someone will, like, you know, maybe a cherry pie to put a red ring of death on his face?

207
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:25,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

208
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:28,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I shouldn't say that, because somebody's going to totally misinterpret that.

209
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:32,800
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't mean someone should actually do this, but it would be kind of... It might happen.

210
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.

211
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Pies in the face are funny.

212
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:37,322
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what Bozo the Clown used to do.

213
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:38,262
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

214
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:41,623
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you actually do it, it's your ass that's going to jail.

215
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:42,724
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow...

216
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:48,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, if you would, your number three thing you would most like to see happen at E3?

217
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo actually releases online games, or games that are online.

218
00:16:56,363 --> 00:17:00,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo actually releases an online game to the shock and awe of many.

219
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:03,707
[SPEAKER_10]: We knew, oh god, it was inevitable somebody was going to drop that one on us.

220
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, say no more.

221
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:12,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see, I'm going to go next, because we'll save the best for last, Jamie.

222
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:22,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, my number three thing I would like to see happen at E3, I would like to see Sega publicly apologize for what they did to the Sonic franchise.

223
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:26,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to see Sega have a press conference and go, look, our bad.

224
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,084
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's my number three thing.

225
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:32,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, my number three.

226
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:33,747
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're ready.

227
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I am, I was just typing that into the computer.

228
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Sega publicly apologize for Sonic.

229
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:38,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, yes.

230
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Pyramid Head showing up killing everyone from G4.

231
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:49,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Lovely.

232
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,714
[SPEAKER_10]: So Pyramid Head will come in there with his sexy self and kill everyone from G4.

233
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:58,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really, because again, we don't want to get sued or watched by the FBI or anything.

234
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:04,648
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't really mean that, but Pyramid Head could come in there and lay the smack down.

235
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,170
[SPEAKER_10]: This is silly or random.

236
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:08,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope the chatroom liked it.

237
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:09,994
[SPEAKER_10]: TheRobD says, that is pretty random.

238
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:11,375
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

239
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:15,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Jonas, your number two most random thing you'd like to see happen at E3.

240
00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:15,818
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

241
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:16,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

242
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:21,822
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the sense of this because Jamie said the person is banned in Orange Downs Radio.

243
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:23,403
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

244
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:27,986
[SPEAKER_10]: If the initials are JT... Who shall not be named?

245
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,307
[SPEAKER_10]: You can use that or Voldemort.

246
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Him showing up at E3.

247
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,672
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Voldemort attends E3.

248
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,376
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be pretty random.

249
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:43,597
[SPEAKER_10]: What would he be doing at E3?

250
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:47,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know the rumor is he was going to go to Penny Arcade Expo, but they couldn't work out an agreement there.

251
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So what would Lord Voldemort be doing at E3?

252
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:51,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

253
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:53,539
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll probably try to censor as many games as possible.

254
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:54,860
[SPEAKER_11]: He'd be carrying the pie.

255
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,300
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is.

256
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,220
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what will happen.

257
00:18:57,861 --> 00:18:58,481
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there you go.

258
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your number two most random thing you'd like to see happen at E3?

259
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:06,183
[SPEAKER_08]: This is less of what I... This is more than likely going to happen.

260
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, because, you know, stupid things come out each year.

261
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:12,471
[SPEAKER_08]: But more crappy games announced based off TV series.

262
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:18,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, uh, Dancing with the Stars, or, um, God, I don't know.

263
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:20,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

264
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Paula, the game.

265
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:26,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Paula, the game.

266
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,662
[SPEAKER_10]: God, if there is a God in heaven, please do not make this happen.

267
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Paula, the game.

268
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:32,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

269
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:35,361
[SPEAKER_10]: My number two thing I would like to see happen at E3.

270
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:40,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to see Nintendo not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.

271
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,909
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'd like to see happen for once at E3.

272
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:46,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to see Nintendo not announce one of their systems out in a new color.

273
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:48,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's self-explanatory.

274
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:48,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie?

275
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two should be we be invited to be the official E3 podcasters.

276
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:58,729
[SPEAKER_10]: So Jamie's showing a little bit of ego there.

277
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:03,291
[SPEAKER_10]: OLR, the official ambassadors to the podcasting universe for E3.

278
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:06,313
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to put OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors.

279
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:06,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that good?

280
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,515
[SPEAKER_10]: And why would they pick us?

281
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:12,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of my boobs?

282
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:12,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

283
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:19,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So then ambassadors with emphasis on the ass.

284
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

285
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:21,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

286
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:25,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, OLR sells out at E3 08.

287
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, number one, the number one thing you would like to see happen at E3 this year.

288
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:33,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Explicit.

289
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:38,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this might get me a little hated here, but Halo 3 delayed or cancelled.

290
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo 3 delayed or cancelled, that would be pretty funny.

291
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:48,051
[SPEAKER_11]: This would be funny, I wanted to see what the fans would say about this if they say it was delayed.

292
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:56,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't actually see it, but remember, this is random or whatever you want, so this is your little sick fantasy is that you want to see the Halo fanboys have a cry.

293
00:20:56,991 --> 00:20:59,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, the number one thing you would like to see happen at E3 this year?

294
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:02,314
[SPEAKER_08]: This honestly is something I really hope to see.

295
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:05,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.

296
00:21:07,238 --> 00:21:08,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And it actually sticks.

297
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:14,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced, or they could come out and say it's out today.

298
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:18,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, if they did that on Xbox Live Arcade, oh

299
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:48,683
[SPEAKER_10]: that would be awesome my number one thing is that I would like to see at E3 all the old Kensha Hall exhibitors picketing outside the auditorium or how about like you know pickaxes and torches just there chanting hell no we won't go and all that stuff alright Jamie your number one thing Skye's voice the game

300
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Please explain this classic Oelarian joke for the sake of our new listeners.

301
00:21:56,661 --> 00:22:01,343
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Rob singing Bumblebee with different lyrics.

302
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:04,264
[SPEAKER_10]: So Konami announces Sky's voice the game.

303
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:04,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

304
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:06,825
[SPEAKER_10]: It's their latest in their Bomani series.

305
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:07,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

306
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,266
[SPEAKER_10]: My ego feels good for that.

307
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:09,706
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there we go.

308
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,647
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's recap the big list we have here.

309
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:14,308
[SPEAKER_10]: This is very wordy, you guys.

310
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:18,570
[SPEAKER_10]: You might have to kind of lean in a little bit to see this, but I'll make the font bigger there so we can all read.

311
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just kind of make that nice and...

312
00:22:22,062 --> 00:22:27,405
[SPEAKER_10]: E3 2007 Pi Bill Gates in the face Nintendo actually releases an online game Sega publicly apologizes for Sonic

313
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:52,622
[SPEAKER_10]: PyramidHead shows up and kills everyone from G4.

314
00:22:54,802 --> 00:22:56,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Lord Voldemort goes to E3.

315
00:22:57,143 --> 00:23:00,744
[SPEAKER_10]: More crappy games based off of TV series like Hey Paula the Game.

316
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:05,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo not announces one of their systems coming out in a new color.

317
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:09,407
[SPEAKER_10]: OLR is named E3 Podcasting Ambassadors.

318
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:12,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo 3 is delayed or cancelled.

319
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:16,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.

320
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:20,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Kensha Hall's exhibitors picket outside the theater.

321
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:24,917
[SPEAKER_10]: and Konami announces Sky's Voice the game as the latest in the Bomani series.

322
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:28,720
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty good list, but unfortunately this list is not perfect.

323
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,843
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to go around and take ones off the list.

324
00:23:32,903 --> 00:23:35,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Explicit, we'll start with you.

325
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:38,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Which one of these items is not worthy of being on the list?

326
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:42,149
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all good, but... This is hard tonight.

327
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:42,870
[SPEAKER_11]: This is hard tonight.

328
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,891
[SPEAKER_11]: This is hard.

329
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:44,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm...

330
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:51,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, man.

331
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I'll have to play the little dance music while Jonas thinks there.

332
00:23:55,338 --> 00:24:01,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have to go with Nintendo and not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.

333
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know it's inevitable that's actually going to happen, right?

334
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:05,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

335
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:06,443
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

336
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:11,385
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Explicit takes out the line about Nintendo will not actually... Whatever.

337
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:11,945
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gone.

338
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:13,286
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter anymore.

339
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:15,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

340
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:17,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

341
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:21,179
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

342
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:25,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Bill Gates getting pied in the face.

343
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:27,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Bill Gates is normally not really at these events too much.

344
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,368
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was like Peter Moore getting pied in the face, maybe.

345
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:31,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

346
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:32,751
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

347
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:33,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

348
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:35,374
[SPEAKER_10]: What would I like to put off the list?

349
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:37,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I am going to pull off the list.

350
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:40,179
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to pull off Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.

351
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:45,413
[SPEAKER_10]: because, come on, it's the laughing stock of the industry, and we can't have that ruined at E3 this year.

352
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:48,194
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good thought, but this is just hard.

353
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:48,914
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a hard list.

354
00:24:49,014 --> 00:24:51,375
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a hard list, so Jamie gets the last remove.

355
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:52,715
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you going to take off the list?

356
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:56,556
[SPEAKER_06]: He shall not be named showing up at E3 because it ain't going to happen.

357
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we wouldn't want that.

358
00:24:57,297 --> 00:25:00,077
[SPEAKER_10]: It's invite only, bitch, and you weren't invited.

359
00:25:00,938 --> 00:25:02,158
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get to crash this party.

360
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,473
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, incoming large paste into chat.

361
00:25:05,774 --> 00:25:09,438
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are going to vote for your top two, your number one and your number two.

362
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:10,780
[SPEAKER_10]: The order is important.

363
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I will assume your first answer is the number one.

364
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:17,287
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

365
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:20,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick, sorry, this is kind of an afterthought, but nonetheless.

366
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:33,069
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be funny to see the people at Gamecock, the ones doing the EIEIO thing, to actually have a Trojan rooster come to the E3 thing and try to see if they can get him to put it in there.

367
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:35,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone will jump out and...

368
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:39,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Here are our finalists for tonight's list list.

369
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,302
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to open up voting to the chat room right now.

370
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:44,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Vote for your number one and number two picks.

371
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:47,906
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll tally them up during the next few stories and reveal the answers to you later in the show.

372
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:48,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

373
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:49,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Things we'd like to see at E3 07.

374
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo actually releases an online game.

375
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Sega publicly apologizes for what they did to Sonic.

376
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:58,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Pyramid Head shows up and kills everyone from G4.

377
00:25:58,615 --> 00:26:00,977
[SPEAKER_10]: More crappy games based off of TV series.

378
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:04,020
[SPEAKER_10]: OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors.

379
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:10,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo 3, Delayed or Cancelled, Kensha Hall Exhibitors, Pickett Outside the Theater, Sky's Voice the Game.

380
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:11,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Why didn't I take that off the list?

381
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:14,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Sky's Voice the Game, announced by Konami.

382
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:16,578
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there you have it.

383
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:19,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get back into the gaming news while the votes come in.

384
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:21,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Gold Farmers are a pain in your ass

385
00:26:35,027 --> 00:27:00,805
[SPEAKER_10]: and Blizzard did a good job with their latest patch though they really managed to squelch the amount of spam that was going out thanks to the limitations they made on trial accounts but that just means the gold farmers have gotten a little more creative I am actually still getting tell spam once in a great while from gold farmers but it's gone way down but this has got to be one of the most creative things we've seen in a long time and that is that these folks now are creating level 1 gnome characters and

386
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:28,466
[SPEAKER_10]: and killing themselves in the main alliance town of Ironforge and spelling out the name of their website I'm not going to read the name of the website but you can see pictures around the internet all these corpses laid out in like .com such and such site I don't want to plug the site because they're cunts for doing this to the game and need to just stay the hell out of the game but you have to give them props at least for being creative why can't we see this kind of advertising in real life

387
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:37,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Blizzard, by the way, one of their reps wrote on their own forums, I ask that any player that witnesses these to report them straight away.

388
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:43,617
[SPEAKER_10]: If you feel so inclined, you can also post the realm name and zone here, and I can see what can be done about getting them handled that way.

389
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:47,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Please, once it's reported, leave the bodies alone.

390
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not linger around or huddle near the bodies.

391
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,974
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, don't give them the attention that they're looking for.

392
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:57,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, I read somewhere else, somebody actually caught one of these midway through.

393
00:27:57,555 --> 00:27:59,115
[SPEAKER_10]: It stopped.

394
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,316
[SPEAKER_10]: You just see all these bodies saying .com.

395
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:06,117
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't see the rest of the site name because I guess the Blizzard folks banned the IPs for too long.

396
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of a creative way to get around.

397
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:10,058
[SPEAKER_10]: If nothing else, it's very creative.

398
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:12,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give them that, even if they are annoying as hell.

399
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:16,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to the chat room, James Patrick says, That's awesome.

400
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:17,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead body advertising is great.

401
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:23,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Sephiroth1215 says, Yeah, it kind of sucks, but for those sad lives of WoW players, it is really funny.

402
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:23,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, wait a minute.

403
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:24,813
[SPEAKER_10]: That's me you're talking about.

404
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:25,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Jerk.

405
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:28,455
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, more news while I tally votes.

406
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:42,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for anyone who plays Second Life, apparently there is now going to be a build of Tokyo in Second Life done by Tetsuya Mizuguchi.

407
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:47,180
[SPEAKER_06]: He's doing actually a reimagined Tokyo for the...

408
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:51,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to actually get a little bit more on that.

409
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:57,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, they're doing, actually completely recreated Tokyo from what it's saying.

410
00:28:57,537 --> 00:29:05,124
[SPEAKER_06]: He wants to do what Tokyo appears to both locals and visitors, something that's a matter of perception.

411
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,727
[SPEAKER_06]: He's quoted actually saying a museum of Japanese pop culture.

412
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:13,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

413
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:14,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

414
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:15,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see how that turns out.

415
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I don't really want to play Second Life.

416
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, interesting thing also coming to PCs.

417
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:26,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead or Alive Online is coming to PCs pretty soon.

418
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:31,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's supposed to be a brand new game in the series.

419
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,333
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't just be some stupid port.

420
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:43,702
[SPEAKER_08]: And so yeah, you will be able to see the Dead or Alive jubblies, I guess, bouncing up and down on your PC in high res.

421
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:44,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray.

422
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,596
[SPEAKER_08]: But you like that, yes?

423
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:49,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, don't get me wrong.

424
00:29:49,596 --> 00:29:50,056
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

425
00:29:50,396 --> 00:30:03,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, since it is on PC, it's been done before by other companies, and they've actually had it where you can strip clothes off of people and stuff while you're fighting in the game.

426
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:13,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hey, you know, this Dead or Alive game, of course, you know, there's a lot of Dead or Alive games on the Xbox 360, but thanks to the Red Rings of Death, some folks have not been able to play them.

427
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:24,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, the internet threw a fit, even the UK was starting to investigate Microsoft, and finally Microsoft this week said, alright, enough, we fucked up, we're sorry.

428
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:25,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter Moore came out and said

429
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:44,162
[SPEAKER_10]: to address specifically the general hardware failures indicated by the three flashing red lights on the console.

430
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:46,984
[SPEAKER_10]: This applies to new and previously sold consoles.

431
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:52,588
[SPEAKER_10]: So in other words, for three years, and the Xbox 360 hasn't even been out that long yet, your console's covered.

432
00:30:52,608 --> 00:30:55,370
[SPEAKER_10]: If you get the three rings of death, you don't have to pay to have it fixed.

433
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,312
[SPEAKER_06]: That means all the people who bought extended warranties

434
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they may cover other failures.

435
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:02,946
[SPEAKER_10]: This is only for the three red rings of death.

436
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:06,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So the extended warranty does cover all the other things that could go wrong.

437
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:10,528
[SPEAKER_10]: But certainly, a lot of folks are applauding Microsoft for this move.

438
00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:13,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, it would be nice if the three red rings of death would never show up in the first place.

439
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:20,331
[SPEAKER_10]: But since Microsoft can't magically cure all the 360s that are already out there, I suppose this is the next best thing.

440
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:25,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Any thoughts from the folks here in studio on the whole warranty policy change?

441
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:26,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's pretty cool.

442
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:30,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad to see that they're actually covering this stuff anyways.

443
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:43,745
[SPEAKER_08]: And then hopefully, I'm assuming since the rumor's been going around that they're redesigning the cooling on it, that this will fix the problem and any of these consoles that are still out there that are failing because of this will get fixed.

444
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:45,587
[SPEAKER_08]: And we won't have to hear about it anymore.

445
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:50,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently Peter Moore has actually joined our chat room or someone impersonating him.

446
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter Moore says, we're sorry, have this three year warranty for the three red lights.

447
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:56,474
[SPEAKER_10]: See, one year for every light.

448
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:57,255
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, bravo.

449
00:31:59,071 --> 00:31:59,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

450
00:32:00,472 --> 00:32:01,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there are three lights?

451
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:03,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, yeah.

452
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:05,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the error one time.

453
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm joking, Rob.

454
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:08,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you.

455
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:09,779
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

456
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:11,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag segment's canceled tonight.

457
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:11,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

458
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie doesn't... You can read it.

459
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:13,882
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't want to read it.

460
00:32:13,902 --> 00:32:15,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to read it last week because you weren't here.

461
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:22,388
[SPEAKER_10]: When you send in your emails to mailbag at orangelonsradio.com, obviously we care very deeply about your emails that you send in to us.

462
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:23,776
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

463
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:47,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Rob, Jamie, and Loki, last week you put out the call for developers who listen to this show to write in, and in that regard I qualify.

464
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:59,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Three weeks ago I started working at Bottle Rocket Entertainment, the team responsible for the Mark of Kree and its sequel on PS2, as an environment artist.

465
00:32:59,158 --> 00:32:59,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool.

466
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,402
[SPEAKER_06]: For the people unsure what that entails, it's pretty much what it sounds like.

467
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Environment artists build the art assets for the level in the game.

468
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:14,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Since I just started recently, I have no grizzled words from the trenches of the horrors of game development, but I wanted to write in anyway as I've been listening to your show since last fall.

469
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:17,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I wanted to thank you guys for the work that you do.

470
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I listen to OLR and other podcasts at work.

471
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,414
[SPEAKER_06]: and it makes my day that much more enjoyable.

472
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:28,839
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, aside from the caffeine, I basically had to subsist on podcasts to get me through the last bit of art school before I got this job.

473
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:36,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I love OLR in particular because your enthusiasm for your program shows and as a result, every episode is guaranteed to entertain.

474
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:38,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for all the work you put into this.

475
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:44,849
[SPEAKER_06]: One last thing, my point of view of game development might be somewhat myopic at this point, but I know people have questions about

476
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:47,043
[SPEAKER_06]: and I might be able to provide some answers.

477
00:33:47,143 --> 00:33:57,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't talk about anything related to the projects we're working on, but if any of your listeners want to know what it's like working in a game company or how best to break into the industry or anything like that, I might be able to help just putting that out there.

478
00:33:58,092 --> 00:34:01,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, yours, Devin L. Well, maybe we'll have to have Devin on the show at some point.

479
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:02,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Ask a developer.

480
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:03,917
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be kind of fun.

481
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:04,678
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be cool.

482
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:10,182
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's kind of neat to know that people on the inside are listening to the program and that always makes us feel pretty good, you know.

483
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:15,700
[SPEAKER_10]: and certainly we were talking about the guy that worked for the Japanese developer.

484
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,681
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually was sending me some pictures from Japan.

485
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:18,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually have to show you.

486
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:21,624
[SPEAKER_10]: He sent me some pictures from a pinball arcade in Japan, so I have to show it.

487
00:34:21,984 --> 00:34:22,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

488
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:23,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So, kind of cool.

489
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:25,547
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you to the developers that listened to the show.

490
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like any other listener, we really appreciate your support.

491
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we got one from the Rob D.

492
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:38,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I was listening to last week's show on the way home from work yesterday, and yes, my quiz will label you as super spastic if you suck in that game.

493
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:45,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always amused when an issue with this word comes up because it shows a giant cultural divide between the USA and the UK that no one is really aware of.

494
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:56,154
[SPEAKER_06]: For whatever reason, the word spaz is highly offensive in the UK, even to the point of the Spastic Society, a non-profit organization to aid those with cerebral palsy, changing its name to SCOPE.

495
00:34:56,812 --> 00:35:01,914
[SPEAKER_06]: In the US, the surfer lingo of the SoCal area made the word spaz a common insult among youth to this date.

496
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:13,500
[SPEAKER_06]: A few years ago, Tiger Woods got in huge trouble with his UK fans when he said that he had played the best I've played for years, and as soon as I got on the green, I was a spaz during last year's Masters.

497
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Americans had no idea what the problem was.

498
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:20,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Merriam-Webster's doesn't even mention cerebral palsy and its definition of the word spaz.

499
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:23,524
[SPEAKER_06]: A little side note, whenever I hear spastic, I think of spastic colon.

500
00:35:24,104 --> 00:35:25,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, back to the email.

501
00:35:26,431 --> 00:35:35,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Although not the most popular, by far the worst and funniest documented case of this happening is when an American wheelchair manufacturer decided to export one of their products to Great Britain for sale there.

502
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:39,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the name of this product was called, I kid you not, The Spaz with two Z's.

503
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,444
[SPEAKER_06]: You can imagine how well that went over.

504
00:35:41,964 --> 00:35:45,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there's a link there, but our thing is not HTML, so poo.

505
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:51,833
[SPEAKER_06]: On one hand, I feel sort of bad for the wheelchair company, but the name was cruel in the first place.

506
00:35:53,121 --> 00:36:01,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that kind of like selling a walker and calling it gimpy or marketing headgear for children with really bad teeth as the most unpopular kid in school brand?

507
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:15,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I guess the closest analogy I can make is if some Asian company wanted to make a humorous shirt that said, I'm chicken on the front and accidentally instead of using the word cock instead of chicken, not realizing how offensive it is.

508
00:36:17,336 --> 00:36:17,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Great show.

509
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:20,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep up and keep up the good work.

510
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:33,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you'll actually get to 500 episodes like I accidentally said you already had on your five-year show, Rob D. You know, I find the term scope offensive because it makes me think of mouthwash, which in turn makes me think of the dentist.

511
00:36:33,146 --> 00:36:39,009
[SPEAKER_10]: And I find dentists to be highly offensive because of what they charge me when I go in there to have my teeth cleaned.

512
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:41,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So I find that term to be offensive.

513
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:41,771
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

514
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:44,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, I'm just messing around.

515
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:48,490
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, we learned a lot about some of those cultural word differences last week.

516
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,911
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I had no idea that that was an offensive term over there.

517
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:55,234
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, it's just part of the world we live in and all those funny little cultural differences.

518
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:57,095
[SPEAKER_06]: More stuff.

519
00:36:57,155 --> 00:36:57,755
[SPEAKER_10]: More stuff.

520
00:36:59,036 --> 00:36:59,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Ossifer, once again.

521
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:00,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

522
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, Rob, you were drunk.

523
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:05,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Quit denying your past.

524
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

525
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:07,761
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I do this time?

526
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:09,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to read on.

527
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:10,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear, Ossifer, I wasn't drunk.

528
00:37:11,584 --> 00:37:13,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what it's referring to.

529
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:17,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, thanks a lot for introducing me to this long anniversary from Powder Powder Paradise with a question mark.

530
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:23,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been listening to it every day, multiple times a day, bolded, ever since, yeah, can you tell that I love it?

531
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:24,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So yay for Rob.

532
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:25,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob is cool.

533
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:26,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob fan mail for the win.

534
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:27,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, I got fan mail.

535
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:30,737
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can't leave Loki or Jamie out, so you all kick ass.

536
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:31,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Smiley face.

537
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, boo, I want to be by myself and then love.

538
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:33,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Bite my butt, Rob.

539
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:36,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Your beloved listener, Osfer.

540
00:37:36,243 --> 00:37:36,583
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

541
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:39,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Supernova location test back on.

542
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:42,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe during the time it was canceled, they made the game better.

543
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:44,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Thoughts, EMUs, maybe?

544
00:37:46,405 --> 00:37:50,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't there some news on the whole Supernova test thing this week, like it's back on now?

545
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:57,807
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I think it was posted to our own site, but that was the wonderful... The wonderful Dark Tetsuya actually stays on top of a lot of that stuff.

546
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:00,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the Supernova 2 test is back on again for July 12, 2007.

547
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,823
[SPEAKER_10]: That's funny because that would be right around the same time as E3.

548
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:08,264
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, that's what is floating around the internet apparently.

549
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:14,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I read more email please?

550
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:14,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

551
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:16,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you sir, may I have another?

552
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:20,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi Orange Lounge Radio, this is a quick email from Mori.

553
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:27,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately for the past two weeks my computer has been relatively out of commission so I wasn't able to send along this message any sooner.

554
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:29,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuses, excuses.

555
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:34,165
[SPEAKER_06]: But congrats on five years and two weeks of being on the air.

556
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:36,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Five years and two weeks as of today, yeah.

557
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:47,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I've listened to your show for about a year and a half now, and since the last few episodes of the original OLR2GO edition of the podcast, you guys are the only show that I can actually sit down and listen to all the way without losing interest.

558
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:48,449
[SPEAKER_06]: In short, you guys are great.

559
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:48,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

560
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a tilde at the end of the thanks.

561
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

562
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:57,252
[SPEAKER_06]: But besides that, a few weeks ago I heard someone mention the Sega Pico at one point in the episodes.

563
00:38:57,622 --> 00:39:00,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I have fond memories of mine, which is currently sitting in a box in my closet.

564
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:04,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually pulled it out and played around with it after hearing that basically it was Sega and edutainment.

565
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:08,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, however, have something vaguely resembling a touchpad, which I forgot about.

566
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:13,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho, considering the apparently huge amount of systems DarkSakura owns, by any chance does she have one?

567
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:18,530
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been something I've been wondering about for a while, since obviously I have nothing better to do.

568
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I do not own a Pico.

569
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:25,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I came very close to purchasing a Pico at Toys R Us, but we bought a Nomad instead.

570
00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:30,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured Nomad, Pico, you know, Nomad high on the pedestal.

571
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:35,217
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I actually have been looking for a Pico since last week.

572
00:39:35,937 --> 00:39:38,480
[SPEAKER_06]: But Bill's and I'm going to Disneyland at the end of the month.

573
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So Disneyland.

574
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:40,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Addict.

575
00:39:40,402 --> 00:39:41,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Disneyland greater than Pico.

576
00:39:42,824 --> 00:39:44,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Teacups are better than Pico.

577
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:46,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I know and I'm going to freaking ride the hell out.

578
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:46,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate you.

579
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the teacups go faster at night, Rob.

580
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you for going to Disneyland on the weekend.

581
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:50,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to move.

582
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:56,630
[SPEAKER_10]: which in turn will probably be no OLR that week but we're changing studios so what can you do?

583
00:39:57,351 --> 00:40:01,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And in closing, thanks again for your awesomeness and I hope to actually call in on the show one day.

584
00:40:01,414 --> 00:40:03,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Owen Sky's GameTap promotion made me subscribe to it.

585
00:40:04,257 --> 00:40:08,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Not quite as big of a purchase as a $60 game but still I thought it was worth mentioning.

586
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Maury, possibly the second youngest listener at 14?

587
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:18,429
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't help because people think I'm already up there in bed with them but I swear I'm not.

588
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:19,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're good.

589
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:33,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have to say though, 14 and having, I have to say for a 14 year old, you have some of the best grammar in an email I have ever seen.

590
00:40:34,313 --> 00:40:35,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing was misspelled.

591
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:37,997
[SPEAKER_06]: You had one typo.

592
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:47,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say that you are a shining example of our public education system working, unless you go to private school.

593
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,700
[SPEAKER_10]: So who's this again?

594
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:50,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Maury.

595
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:52,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Maury, our listener of the week, everybody.

596
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:53,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it up.

597
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:56,486
[SPEAKER_06]: You are the emailer of the millennium.

598
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:58,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

599
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:03,692
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is by Schwal...

600
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,130
[SPEAKER_06]: 22, I guess.

601
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:10,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, been a while since I've written and I had to correct Loki's misuse of a word last week.

602
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:13,792
[SPEAKER_06]: When referring to a mentally handicapped person, it's retard.

603
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:16,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Example, that guy is a fucking retard.

604
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:24,135
[SPEAKER_06]: When referring to music, that's R-I-T-A-R-D, short for retardando, which means to gradually become slower.

605
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually was the one last week that said that retard is used in music.

606
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:32,481
[SPEAKER_10]: But I knew it was the misspelling, but you still say it the same way.

607
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:34,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's just two different spellings, same pronunciation.

608
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:36,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, keep up the good work.

609
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:37,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I really have been enjoying this show.

610
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:40,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, more people should play Overlord.

611
00:41:40,807 --> 00:41:41,528
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny as hell.

612
00:41:41,928 --> 00:41:42,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy it so we get a sequel.

613
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:43,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

614
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:45,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Will do, chief.

615
00:41:48,113 --> 00:41:49,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Loki, retard your anger.

616
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:52,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email, last email is from Nintendomaniac64.

617
00:41:52,116 --> 00:41:52,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

618
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:57,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, hola, bonjour, guten tag, konnichiwa, etc.

619
00:41:57,567 --> 00:42:00,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Although actually it's evening for us, so it would be konbanwa?

620
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:00,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

621
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:03,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, picky lady.

622
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:05,374
[SPEAKER_06]: This is me, Rob.

623
00:42:05,694 --> 00:42:06,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go get a water.

624
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:07,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, whatever.

625
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:13,040
[SPEAKER_06]: This question is pretty much unrelated to OLR, but I may need the input by a largest group of people, a.k.a.

626
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:19,826
[SPEAKER_06]: the chatroom, and not be completely ignored due to the uber speed that the comments travel at in the said chatroom.

627
00:42:20,976 --> 00:42:29,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'm finally going to be in an M3 Perfect, which is the slot 2 version to replace my broken supercard CF, which had a connector pin.

628
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:33,483
[SPEAKER_06]: This has nothing to do with the... Well, you said it had nothing to do with the show.

629
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:38,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, chat room, I'm just going to read the question, okay?

630
00:42:39,273 --> 00:43:06,911
[SPEAKER_06]: um it said to replace my broken supercard CF which had a connector pin in the CF slot break off yes I tried to solder it back and it still doesn't work my question is if you or the chat room know if there are any mini or micro SD cards that are 4 gigabyte but not SDHC since the M3 the perfect isn't compatible with SDHC I'm still not sure if I'm going to get a 2 gig or 4 gig SD card but if there are any 4 gigabyte mini or micro non SDHC cards my problem is solved right there

631
00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:15,306
[SPEAKER_06]: and if anyone yells in the chat room and get an R4 or something, he needs 32 megabyte of extra RAM.

632
00:43:15,466 --> 00:43:16,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, whatever.

633
00:43:16,066 --> 00:43:17,167
[SPEAKER_06]: This has nothing to do with the show.

634
00:43:17,947 --> 00:43:19,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to read your answer.

635
00:43:19,968 --> 00:43:22,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Email people, okay?

636
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:23,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Your question fails.

637
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have an email from Sauce.

638
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:31,871
[SPEAKER_06]: This says, Dear Rob, there are four lights.

639
00:43:33,672 --> 00:43:34,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Love, Tiara.

640
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:36,493
[SPEAKER_08]: There are four lights, but only three show...

641
00:43:36,778 --> 00:43:40,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to play Rob's voice the game to Iraqi Suicide Babies.

642
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:47,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I left the room when I heard Nintendo Maniac 64 send an email, but then I heard my name.

643
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:49,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding, hearts.

644
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:50,044
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

645
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:51,365
[SPEAKER_06]: This email's from Sauce.

646
00:43:51,405 --> 00:43:55,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Rob, there are four... Yes, but when the system breaks, there's only three that come on.

647
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:58,102
[SPEAKER_10]: What's it say?

648
00:43:58,182 --> 00:43:58,542
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

649
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:01,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait to play Rob's Voice the Game 2, Iraqi Suicide Baby.

650
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:05,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Because four blinking lights means that your AV cable is unplugged.

651
00:44:05,068 --> 00:44:07,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Best email ever, except for the 14-year-old that can spell shit.

652
00:44:09,853 --> 00:44:10,854
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, close the mailbag.

653
00:44:11,655 --> 00:44:12,495
[SPEAKER_10]: We're way over time.

654
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:14,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag is belated.

655
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:17,940
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, if you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelongerator.com.

656
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:20,463
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe Jamie will make fun of you on air next.

657
00:44:21,414 --> 00:44:44,710
[SPEAKER_08]: or or compliment your grammar I would actually like to see we should have a grammar contest let's see if there's some 13 and 12 year olds that want to send in some emails and try to one-up Mori wouldn't that be exciting awesome uh so anyways I guess the ongoing quest to get Mother 3 translated is um going pretty well now two teams have kind of joined forces on the project and um

658
00:44:45,919 --> 00:44:46,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

659
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:51,261
[SPEAKER_08]: No word on yet when it's going to be done, but... Well, actually, no.

660
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there was a small update.

661
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:57,224
[SPEAKER_08]: They said that they're shooting for a release this year.

662
00:44:58,204 --> 00:45:01,365
[SPEAKER_08]: So... Awesome, I guess?

663
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:02,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

664
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:06,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much a fan of Mother 3, but... Great.

665
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking love EarthBound.

666
00:45:08,688 --> 00:45:11,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Why doesn't Nintendo, I don't know, translate the game themselves?

667
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:12,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Sell it here?

668
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:13,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're dumbasses.

669
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they would rather, you know...

670
00:45:16,656 --> 00:45:19,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Redo Picross and release it on the DS.

671
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,822
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so much Nintendo hate tonight.

672
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:23,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize to the Nintendo fans, but I don't.

673
00:45:24,184 --> 00:45:24,585
[SPEAKER_10]: It's alright.

674
00:45:24,665 --> 00:45:25,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week will be a Nintendo love.

675
00:45:26,146 --> 00:45:26,607
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

676
00:45:27,387 --> 00:45:32,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's a lot of love for this this week.

677
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:38,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock Band had some footage hit the internet and a lot of folks were very, very happy about this.

678
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:41,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to play this in studio here because I'm sure not everybody has seen it.

679
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, never mind, I can't.

680
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:43,959
[SPEAKER_10]: It got taken off YouTube.

681
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,963
[SPEAKER_10]: But basically, okay, imagine Guitar Hero side by side three times and Karaoke Revolution on top.

682
00:45:51,304 --> 00:45:52,704
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of what Rock Band looked like.

683
00:45:52,925 --> 00:46:02,010
[SPEAKER_10]: And the video, I guess, was leaked to the Internet, so then Harmonix kind of had to step in and put something a little more legit out there and kind of confess to what was going on.

684
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:09,750
[SPEAKER_10]: and mentioned that the song that you heard in there, Welcome to the Jungle, was just a demo song and may not actually be in the final version of the game.

685
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,131
[SPEAKER_06]: That was so awesome.

686
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:12,431
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked like a shitload of fun.

687
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:13,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you guys see the clip?

688
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:14,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, yes.

689
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:15,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it looks good.

690
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:21,432
[SPEAKER_10]: The only negative complaint I've heard on it is that maybe the karaoke part is too small, which could be very hard to see on a regular TV.

691
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:23,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about that, but it looked pretty good.

692
00:46:25,153 --> 00:46:28,294
[SPEAKER_06]: But doesn't everybody have a widescreen HDTV these days, huh?

693
00:46:28,314 --> 00:46:30,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not so much that, but shouldn't everyone...

694
00:46:31,545 --> 00:46:34,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Shouldn't everyone know the lyrics to Welcome to the Jungle?

695
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, shouldn't you know this song by heart?

696
00:46:36,288 --> 00:46:40,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the lyrics.

697
00:46:43,052 --> 00:46:44,132
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I could just make it up.

698
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:48,174
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't need the... There's other words in there too, but who cares?

699
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:51,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Will this game let you cheat like Karaoke Revolution does?

700
00:46:51,216 --> 00:46:58,060
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they supposedly have a thing that detects the phonics in your voice so that you're not going to be able to go... You know, like, what was it, um...

701
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:04,240
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the end of the world as we know it, where it's like, uh, you know, the whole song.

702
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,742
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I sing it's the end of the world as we know it in Karaoke Revolution.

703
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever played any of the Japanese versions of Karaoke Revolution?

704
00:47:09,824 --> 00:47:10,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not.

705
00:47:10,724 --> 00:47:13,466
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually make sure that you are pronouncing everything right.

706
00:47:13,907 --> 00:47:14,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

707
00:47:15,027 --> 00:47:16,308
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very, very specific.

708
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:19,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

709
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:23,013
[SPEAKER_10]: TheRobD says that was the greatest rendition of Welcome to the Jungle ever.

710
00:47:23,253 --> 00:47:25,835
[SPEAKER_10]: See why they want Sky's voice in the game?

711
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:28,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Ego plus five right there.

712
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:33,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus four strength, plus four stam, plus four ego.

713
00:47:35,506 --> 00:47:39,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft says, is telling the Rob D, Harmonix says it won't be that expensive.

714
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:43,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, because the Rob D said, Rock Band Eagles, expensive game I won't be buying.

715
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:45,392
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

716
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:46,933
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be fun, though.

717
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:50,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie will buy it, because she loves those types of games.

718
00:47:50,395 --> 00:47:58,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I will probably get suckered into buying it, like I did with Guitar Hero 2, and then I won't play it again.

719
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:04,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I will not do the karaoke portion of the game, though.

720
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:05,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I might.

721
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:09,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Please, one time on the show, do the karaoke.

722
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Never!

723
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Please, can't you do Welcome to the Jungle?

724
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:17,847
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but you just did such a wonderful rendition there.

725
00:48:19,488 --> 00:48:22,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I hate Loki right now, I still love Jamie for now.

726
00:48:22,998 --> 00:48:27,199
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will allow her a chance to share with you all her website of the week.

727
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:28,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Because she was out last week.

728
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,561
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's got to make it extra good this week.

729
00:48:30,901 --> 00:48:31,341
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

730
00:48:31,381 --> 00:48:32,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I was dead sore last week.

731
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:38,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Where should the kids be pointing their websites, browsers this week?

732
00:48:38,363 --> 00:48:41,724
[SPEAKER_06]: The website of the week is newsaskew.com.

733
00:48:43,745 --> 00:48:46,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's Kevin Smith.

734
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:48,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't need to tell you anything else.

735
00:48:49,267 --> 00:48:50,207
[SPEAKER_06]: It's freaking Kevin Smith.

736
00:48:51,616 --> 00:48:53,497
[SPEAKER_10]: News for View Askew MoviePoopShoot.com

737
00:49:20,948 --> 00:49:24,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I seem to remember that Kevin Smith will actually post on his forums and stuff.

738
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:27,672
[SPEAKER_06]: He's actually got a blog up too.

739
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:28,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.

740
00:49:28,192 --> 00:49:29,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Called My Boring Ass Life.

741
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:35,377
[SPEAKER_10]: The internet did forgive him for Jersey Girl though, right?

742
00:49:36,197 --> 00:49:36,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

743
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:38,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's fair to say the internet.

744
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:39,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I never did see Clerks 2 though.

745
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I should hang my head in shame.

746
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to go rent it.

747
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:43,442
[SPEAKER_10]: I do need to see it.

748
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:44,262
[SPEAKER_10]: How did I miss it?

749
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:46,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't still watch any movies anymore.

750
00:49:46,223 --> 00:49:46,684
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sad.

751
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And Kevin Smith has a MySpace too.

752
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:49,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Does he?

753
00:49:49,966 --> 00:49:50,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I should add him.

754
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:52,809
[SPEAKER_10]: I love The Evening with Kevin Smith.

755
00:49:52,829 --> 00:49:54,510
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like one of my favorite DVDs ever.

756
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,872
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, newsaskew.com.

757
00:49:56,892 --> 00:49:59,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Check it out when you're taking a break from games.

758
00:49:59,615 --> 00:50:01,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Does Kevin Smith admit that he plays video games?

759
00:50:02,117 --> 00:50:02,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I would imagine he does.

760
00:50:02,978 --> 00:50:03,738
[SPEAKER_10]: He seems like a big nerd.

761
00:50:03,758 --> 00:50:04,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

762
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how come there hasn't been a Jay and Silent Bob video game?

763
00:50:07,562 --> 00:50:08,182
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I want to know.

764
00:50:09,303 --> 00:50:09,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe someday.

765
00:50:10,064 --> 00:50:10,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Good question.

766
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:13,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Anywho...

767
00:50:15,492 --> 00:50:17,694
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some interesting news coming from Australia.

768
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:29,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, a sort of affair between a 31-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy went awry, and she was arrested for kidnapping charges.

769
00:50:30,284 --> 00:50:44,214
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole thing took place over World of Warcraft, where apparently the 31-year-old... I'm just going to assume that she was a MILF, because, you know, she's... Well, no, of course not.

770
00:50:44,595 --> 00:50:44,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways...

771
00:50:45,665 --> 00:50:47,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, if she's hitting on 17-year-old boys, who knows?

772
00:50:47,607 --> 00:50:47,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

773
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:48,247
[SPEAKER_10]: MILF?

774
00:50:48,307 --> 00:50:51,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean, like, mom is large and fat?

775
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that MILF?

776
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:57,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

777
00:50:57,533 --> 00:51:01,536
[SPEAKER_08]: So, apparently she was, you know,

778
00:51:02,932 --> 00:51:08,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Creating this deep and trusting relationship with her barely legal boyfriend for more than a year.

779
00:51:09,137 --> 00:51:12,439
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you form a deep and trusting relationship on World of Warcraft?

780
00:51:12,859 --> 00:51:13,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

781
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:20,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I will give you this four-strength, four-stam leather belt if you will eat my pussy.

782
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:21,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

783
00:51:21,326 --> 00:51:22,286
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you do that?

784
00:51:26,269 --> 00:51:27,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I'll give you a Leroy Jenkins.

785
00:51:29,772 --> 00:51:31,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a new sexual term?

786
00:51:33,317 --> 00:51:35,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what these two say during... Oh, I shouldn't even say that.

787
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:36,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I shouldn't use that as bad.

788
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mind.

789
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:48,770
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, apparently she was going to... Was it... She was going to meet the boy and they were going... Because she lived in Australia, but she was going to meet him.

790
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:56,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess he lived out of country and basically take him with her and they were going to fly to Australia and he was going to live with her.

791
00:51:57,336 --> 00:52:00,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently the parents found out about it and had her arrested.

792
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, so she was Australian?

793
00:52:02,741 --> 00:52:02,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

794
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:03,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

795
00:52:04,732 --> 00:52:05,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

796
00:52:06,313 --> 00:52:09,896
[SPEAKER_10]: What's wrong with you guys in Australia and your MILFs?

797
00:52:10,296 --> 00:52:10,976
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

798
00:52:11,897 --> 00:52:13,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, it's one bad apple ruining the barrel.

799
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:23,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure the media hasn't gone crazy with this story about how World of Warcraft is predator for children and blah, blah, blah.

800
00:52:23,285 --> 00:52:28,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Dateline NBC special about the scary MILFs on Warcraft reaching out.

801
00:52:29,235 --> 00:52:31,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Buying plane tickets for 17-year-old boys.

802
00:52:31,336 --> 00:52:33,458
[SPEAKER_08]: The boy lived in North Carolina.

803
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:40,202
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would assume that the age of consent, of course, here is usually over 18.

804
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:42,023
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a long plane ride.

805
00:52:42,043 --> 00:52:44,285
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll probably be 18 by the time he gets to Australia.

806
00:52:44,385 --> 00:52:45,906
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's so wrong with that?

807
00:52:46,046 --> 00:52:49,028
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, with the time zone changes and the date line, you know.

808
00:52:49,648 --> 00:52:49,788
[SPEAKER_08]: He's 18.

809
00:52:49,848 --> 00:52:50,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

810
00:52:51,866 --> 00:52:55,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well we are just about done with all the stories for tonight.

811
00:52:55,427 --> 00:52:59,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are going to be opening up the Skype line for you guys to call in and interact with our program.

812
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,150
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to give us a call, you can call us on Skype.

813
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.

814
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can call us on our 800 number, or I should say 877 number.

815
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:07,472
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

816
00:53:07,772 --> 00:53:08,332
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

817
00:53:08,492 --> 00:53:09,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, we will take...

818
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:19,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Your calls very soon.

819
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:21,869
[SPEAKER_10]: However, first, we have another score to settle.

820
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,611
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's tonight's list list.

821
00:53:26,473 --> 00:53:28,354
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to know who won tonight's list list.

822
00:53:28,374 --> 00:53:32,638
[SPEAKER_10]: The topic tonight, of course, most random things we'd like to see at this year's E3.

823
00:53:32,658 --> 00:53:33,518
[SPEAKER_10]: We have winners.

824
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:35,600
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's reveal them now.

825
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Number three, the number three thing our chat room would like to most see happen to E3 this year.

826
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:43,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo 3 gets delayed or canceled.

827
00:53:44,893 --> 00:53:46,194
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

828
00:54:12,768 --> 00:54:14,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Pyramid Head must show up and kill everyone.

829
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:15,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

830
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:18,350
[SPEAKER_10]: There you have it.

831
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:22,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight's definitive list of the needs of E3 2007.

832
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:27,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's open up the Skype line and take some calls.

833
00:54:27,053 --> 00:54:30,814
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Did they do a good job tonight, you think?

834
00:54:32,474 --> 00:54:33,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they did a good one.

835
00:54:33,455 --> 00:54:33,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

836
00:54:34,195 --> 00:54:35,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they came up with a good list.

837
00:54:35,635 --> 00:54:36,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you guys think.

838
00:54:37,336 --> 00:54:38,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

839
00:54:39,837 --> 00:54:40,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

840
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:41,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

841
00:54:41,997 --> 00:54:42,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Raven's Dolphin!

842
00:54:43,258 --> 00:54:44,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, surprise, surprise.

843
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,060
[SPEAKER_10]: How did you get through Raven's Dolphin?

844
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,941
[SPEAKER_02]: My new Mac, that's why.

845
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have us on speed dial?

846
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:50,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

847
00:54:51,183 --> 00:54:52,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, it worked.

848
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:53,604
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

849
00:54:54,545 --> 00:55:01,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the E3's coming up, and I know everyone's really excited, and the thing about it is, it's very small.

850
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:05,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it feel weird to you that it's now instead of it was in May?

851
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:09,675
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it was around my birthday, and I was like, yeah, E3's coming up!

852
00:55:09,695 --> 00:55:10,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, now it's like, E3's up?

853
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:19,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, but at the same time as we were kind of saying in part A, just because it's a smaller show doesn't mean the companies have any less or more to gain.

854
00:55:19,555 --> 00:55:25,619
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's going to be press there that's just as, you know, as honest as there were in years past.

855
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:29,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I think enough people have managed to get in, even though it's supposed to have been a lockdown show or whatever.

856
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:42,631
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't really see what's exactly changed except for the fact that, you know, little podcasters like us and little press and foreign press and GameStop employees don't get in and Best Buy employees and all that crap.

857
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:45,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess you're right.

858
00:55:45,192 --> 00:55:48,578
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're still going to get the press conferences like we normally do.

859
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't see much of a change like you said.

860
00:55:51,584 --> 00:55:52,847
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're still going to see it.

861
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:55,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't know.

862
00:55:55,718 --> 00:55:58,859
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens as E3 goes on.

863
00:55:58,919 --> 00:55:59,559
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be hard to say.

864
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:12,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And you could say that there's not as many people to tear apart the demos or base their opinion of games right off the demos, but you're seeing the whole Xbox Live and PlayStation 3 become more and more and more.

865
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:13,581
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

866
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:20,162
[SPEAKER_10]: You can download those on their own live or PlayStation Network services, so you can get a lot of those demos, actually.

867
00:56:21,243 --> 00:56:23,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited for actually bringing it home.

868
00:56:24,273 --> 00:56:28,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be really interesting because they did an okay job with it last year.

869
00:56:28,437 --> 00:56:32,580
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the people like me saying, oh, my, ooh, Lost Planet's on Xbox Live.

870
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:41,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at E3 last year, and I still enjoyed the Xbox Live, you know, watching their videos from the show floor because I kind of actually liked seeing some of the booths I went to at E3.

871
00:56:41,808 --> 00:56:42,688
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of fun.

872
00:56:42,768 --> 00:56:43,249
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know.

873
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:44,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'm just weird like that.

874
00:56:45,714 --> 00:56:48,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll be home too, but Scott got that thing on his head.

875
00:56:48,496 --> 00:56:50,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I heard about that over at Allgame.

876
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:51,378
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell is that?

877
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:53,480
[SPEAKER_10]: He bought a webcam for his head?

878
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,460
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to E3?

879
00:56:55,021 --> 00:56:58,884
[SPEAKER_10]: See, with stuff like that, you're not going to keep people out of E3.

880
00:57:00,665 --> 00:57:03,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Where there is information, there will be people seeking it out.

881
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:04,688
[SPEAKER_10]: One more thing, RavenSolven?

882
00:57:05,348 --> 00:57:06,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one more thing.

883
00:57:06,989 --> 00:57:11,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I just bought this Mac, and no, I'm not using games because there's no such thing as games on the Mac!

884
00:57:12,874 --> 00:57:14,675
[SPEAKER_10]: So what did you buy the Mac for, angry one?

885
00:57:15,751 --> 00:57:17,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it because of change.

886
00:57:17,132 --> 00:57:18,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, Loki, don't kill me.

887
00:57:18,693 --> 00:57:20,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't pick up that pitchfork.

888
00:57:20,574 --> 00:57:21,234
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll be okay.

889
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,616
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, I'm not switching.

890
00:57:23,996 --> 00:57:24,196
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

891
00:57:25,297 --> 00:57:27,418
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, thanks for the call, Raven Stolven.

892
00:57:27,438 --> 00:57:27,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

893
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:29,039
[SPEAKER_10]: You too, bye.

894
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:29,659
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, bye-bye.

895
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:31,500
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

896
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:36,483
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, Maury, our emailer of the week, sent me a private message in chat.

897
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:39,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Maury says, just for clarification, I am in public school.

898
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:44,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, well then, wherever you are, congrats to your public school system.

899
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:47,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Give your English teachers mad props for me.

900
00:57:48,986 --> 00:57:50,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And mad props to you for paying attention.

901
00:57:51,026 --> 00:57:53,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to show you this on air real quick because there's not a lot of calls coming in right now.

902
00:57:54,028 --> 00:57:54,928
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want more calls.

903
00:57:55,188 --> 00:57:55,628
[SPEAKER_10]: But look at this.

904
00:57:55,668 --> 00:57:57,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody just sent me the link for this in chat.

905
00:57:57,189 --> 00:57:59,030
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually what they're doing at E3.

906
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:02,711
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see that Scott is on... I can see your arm.

907
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:03,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

908
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:07,093
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see Scott is on live right now playing Texas Hold'em.

909
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:09,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I think he must have it hooked into his TV or something.

910
00:58:10,831 --> 00:58:15,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, he's filing a complaint against somebody right now on Xbox Live.

911
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:16,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that weird?

912
00:58:17,772 --> 00:58:18,332
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

913
00:58:19,272 --> 00:58:21,153
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like reality TV gone crazy.

914
00:58:22,153 --> 00:58:24,093
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says, Link, rush out the fuck up.

915
00:58:25,053 --> 00:58:29,294
[SPEAKER_08]: My god, I'd love to do this with my cat while I'm, you know, wait for the day.

916
00:58:29,354 --> 00:58:32,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally at work, you know, the cat stays in the bedroom.

917
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:36,495
[SPEAKER_08]: I should put a camera up on the wall or something.

918
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:40,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to say hi from OLR in the chat room, but it wouldn't let me because I didn't have a nickname, so...

919
00:58:40,953 --> 00:58:42,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Legend of Zaku How was anime next?

920
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:45,896
[SPEAKER_10]: It was alright though, I mean, I know I was rooming with Ranma, so it was even better

921
00:59:08,724 --> 00:59:15,867
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, yeah, I, yeah, since I think he's not here right now, he's supposed to be calling you to give you the scoop on everything.

922
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, wait, hold on, hold on.

923
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:18,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

924
00:59:19,668 --> 00:59:20,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, what's up?

925
00:59:20,868 --> 00:59:23,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I put Zaku on hold because I saw you calling in on the back line.

926
00:59:23,669 --> 00:59:24,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I conference?

927
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,130
[SPEAKER_10]: How do I conference?

928
00:59:27,511 --> 00:59:28,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, let me see.

929
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:29,612
[SPEAKER_10]: This might put you on hold.

930
00:59:30,852 --> 00:59:31,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

931
00:59:32,433 --> 00:59:33,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Zaku, are you still there?

932
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:34,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

933
00:59:34,365 --> 00:59:35,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Ranma's actually on the other line.

934
00:59:35,987 --> 00:59:37,267
[SPEAKER_10]: We just had to put him on hold.

935
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:38,388
[SPEAKER_10]: God damn it.

936
00:59:38,428 --> 00:59:39,169
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we conference?

937
00:59:39,189 --> 00:59:40,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't you conference in the studio?

938
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:41,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, there's a button that says conference.

939
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:44,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Join current call to another call.

940
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:48,816
[SPEAKER_10]: This is live radio, boys and girls.

941
00:59:50,777 --> 00:59:51,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

942
00:59:52,218 --> 00:59:52,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

943
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:53,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

944
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:55,000
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm conferencing with you.

945
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

946
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,701
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to call you right back.

947
00:59:57,582 --> 00:59:57,902
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

948
00:59:57,982 --> 00:59:58,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Live radio, boys and girls.

949
01:00:01,104 --> 01:00:01,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you still there, Ranma?

950
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:04,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

951
01:00:05,607 --> 01:00:06,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucked it all up.

952
01:00:06,588 --> 01:00:06,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma!

953
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:08,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma!

954
01:00:11,932 --> 01:00:13,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I just lost our entire Anime Next report.

955
01:00:19,918 --> 01:00:21,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just call Zaku back.

956
01:00:23,941 --> 01:00:24,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

957
01:00:24,842 --> 01:00:26,083
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't work, so whatever.

958
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Just give us your report and then we'll hope Ranma calls back.

959
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:28,905
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

960
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:35,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, basically, between the agreement between me and him, I'm covering the gaming aspect of it.

961
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:50,737
[SPEAKER_12]: So far, their gaming room, I mean, it has the usual stuff, Halo, Dirt Strike, they added stuff like, you know, Guitar Hero, and the inevitable 2DX setup, which was mediocre at best.

962
01:00:51,297 --> 01:00:55,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but that's about it, they had tournaments on certain games, like Smash Bros.,

963
01:00:57,316 --> 01:00:58,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there any new stuff in the game room?

964
01:00:58,937 --> 01:00:59,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Stuff you hadn't seen before?

965
01:01:01,018 --> 01:01:05,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Only the guitar gear from what I heard since they replaced the DDR setup with that.

966
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,681
[SPEAKER_12]: They used the 360 version.

967
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:09,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, interesting.

968
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:09,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

969
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:13,824
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they held tournaments on that and Gears of War.

970
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:22,017
[SPEAKER_12]: But besides that, they were also selling a lot of imports in the dealer's room within the convention hall.

971
01:01:22,357 --> 01:01:24,718
[SPEAKER_12]: So I managed to snag a copy of Fifth Style for like $40.

972
01:01:25,518 --> 01:01:25,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

973
01:01:25,918 --> 01:01:29,619
[SPEAKER_10]: What about any gaming paraphernalia, for lack of a better word?

974
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Like this Ball Fair figure came from something like that.

975
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:34,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they were all in the dealer room.

976
01:01:35,081 --> 01:01:39,422
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot of cosplayers dressing up as Mario and other video game characters.

977
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:44,104
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, most of the good merchandise... I bet you didn't see someone dressed up as a Wii Remote.

978
01:01:45,052 --> 01:01:46,813
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, actually, close.

979
01:01:47,354 --> 01:01:50,977
[SPEAKER_12]: An actual Wii, with the other person holding the Wii mode behind them.

980
01:01:51,117 --> 01:01:52,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Jonas, I think someone stole your idea.

981
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:57,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, they cosplay as an actual Wii system without the Wii mode?

982
01:01:57,402 --> 01:01:57,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

983
01:01:57,642 --> 01:02:02,666
[SPEAKER_12]: No, an actual Wii system, and then this other person was holding the Wii mode for them.

984
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:05,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard rumors that that showed up in Sack Enemy in January.

985
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,932
[SPEAKER_11]: If that is the case, I might see him on Sack Enemy in July.

986
01:02:11,947 --> 01:02:14,928
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking about an East Coast thing, I don't know.

987
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:18,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Who the hell would come to SAC for an anime convention if you don't live here?

988
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the Bay Area, maybe.

989
01:02:20,651 --> 01:02:23,352
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking about something that happened in Jersey, not Sacramento.

990
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:24,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, look.

991
01:02:25,613 --> 01:02:27,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Now stop the whole bi-coastal thing.

992
01:02:27,374 --> 01:02:29,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Zaku, anything else you want to share on the game room?

993
01:02:31,055 --> 01:02:32,576
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty much about it, I mean...

994
01:02:33,802 --> 01:02:41,724
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it was really... The only thing I can say that really pissed me off was just the fact that it was too small and they were just controlling crowds.

995
01:02:42,245 --> 01:02:47,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, it was basically almost like a nightclub where they just had people just waiting there in line.

996
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:51,887
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, since the game room was packed most of the time anyways.

997
01:02:53,408 --> 01:02:53,908
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah.

998
01:02:55,048 --> 01:03:01,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can go to Ranma and get his side of the story on what's going on.

999
01:03:02,034 --> 01:03:03,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to say about the con real quick?

1000
01:03:04,555 --> 01:03:05,095
[SPEAKER_12]: It was alright.

1001
01:03:05,155 --> 01:03:08,856
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's my first con, so I really don't have that much to say.

1002
01:03:10,176 --> 01:03:12,917
[SPEAKER_12]: All I need to know is that I need to go to more conventions.

1003
01:03:13,077 --> 01:03:14,498
[SPEAKER_10]: But you want to go to more cons now?

1004
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:17,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I guess I got a plan for next year.

1005
01:03:17,118 --> 01:03:17,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's a con!

1006
01:03:18,439 --> 01:03:19,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess that's a good sign.

1007
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:23,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, who knows?

1008
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping next year I'll be able to afford an East Coast con, so we'll see.

1009
01:03:26,701 --> 01:03:27,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1010
01:03:28,061 --> 01:03:28,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, later, Zaku.

1011
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:30,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, later.

1012
01:03:30,592 --> 01:03:34,255
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, now that I'm finished with Zaku, Ranma is nowhere to be seen.

1013
01:03:35,215 --> 01:03:36,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I should be able to call him back, though.

1014
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:37,397
[SPEAKER_10]: He's somewhere in the history, right?

1015
01:03:39,739 --> 01:03:40,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it.

1016
01:03:40,959 --> 01:03:42,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Live radio, boys and girls.

1017
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:43,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess not.

1018
01:03:44,222 --> 01:03:45,343
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take another call real quick.

1019
01:03:46,403 --> 01:03:47,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1020
01:03:47,304 --> 01:03:47,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1021
01:03:48,785 --> 01:03:49,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guys.

1022
01:03:49,145 --> 01:03:50,486
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Footy Monster from Argentina.

1023
01:03:50,506 --> 01:03:51,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Footy Monster.

1024
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:52,308
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

1025
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,549
[SPEAKER_10]: We're waiting for Ranma to call back, but he never did.

1026
01:03:54,589 --> 01:03:55,810
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're taking another call in the meantime.

1027
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:56,371
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's on your mind?

1028
01:03:57,131 --> 01:03:59,173
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, then I'll make it fast just in case he calls back.

1029
01:03:59,253 --> 01:03:59,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.

1030
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:01,375
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1031
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,681
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1032
01:04:41,285 --> 01:04:55,255
[SPEAKER_01]: or you might have like a ball that starts going faster and faster which is second or you might need to blow into the screen to have the ball go up a little bit all the time instead of keep going down because sometimes you're like on a scrolling screen and you're always going up and if you get stuck you die and stuff like that.

1033
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,956
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really weird but it's actually pretty fun.

1034
01:04:57,076 --> 01:04:57,817
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you control that?

1035
01:04:57,857 --> 01:04:58,497
[SPEAKER_01]: With the stylus?

1036
01:04:59,398 --> 01:05:00,058
[SPEAKER_01]: All with the stylus.

1037
01:05:00,078 --> 01:05:01,339
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no buttons whatsoever.

1038
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you drag the paddle around or...?

1039
01:05:04,753 --> 01:05:05,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you drag the paddle around.

1040
01:05:06,093 --> 01:05:08,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you've got to drag just left and right.

1041
01:05:08,294 --> 01:05:11,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can drag across the whole screen so you can actually move it up and down too.

1042
01:05:11,915 --> 01:05:14,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this level where you actually have to draw your own paddle.

1043
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:15,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1044
01:05:15,596 --> 01:05:17,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can draw it in any shape you want.

1045
01:05:17,397 --> 01:05:17,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.

1046
01:05:18,337 --> 01:05:19,237
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds pretty cool.

1047
01:05:19,937 --> 01:05:20,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1048
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:24,599
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a team of ten people that made it, and it's like 20 bucks or something like that.

1049
01:05:24,619 --> 01:05:29,700
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I'm definitely going to try to pick it up next week when I go to Toronto.

1050
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:29,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So

1051
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:31,918
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1052
01:05:46,616 --> 01:05:50,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's a little part where you're basically controlling a ship.

1053
01:05:50,338 --> 01:05:53,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having just a paddle, it's a ship that shoots lasers.

1054
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:59,463
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually shoot lasers and destroy obstacles on the screen and stuff like that while you're bouncing the ball around.

1055
01:05:59,803 --> 01:06:01,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get to fight Doh?

1056
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:03,626
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that, sorry?

1057
01:06:03,646 --> 01:06:04,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you get to fight Doh?

1058
01:06:05,947 --> 01:06:06,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1059
01:06:07,628 --> 01:06:07,868
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1060
01:06:08,568 --> 01:06:11,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Real quickly, before we let you go, anything you're looking forward to at E3 this week?

1061
01:06:13,068 --> 01:06:23,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, I'm looking for everything RPG related for obvious reasons, and I'm really curious to see if Sega is going to announce anything related to Shenmue, like at all, even Shenmue Online, anything.

1062
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:32,395
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just the hopeful in me that I know it will not happen, but I have to keep wondering about it, you know, because they robbed me from my Shenmue 3, so hey, you know.

1063
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:37,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say you have about as much chance of seeing Shenmue 3 as you do the public apology for Sonic.

1064
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:40,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Shenmue 2 sort of bombed, didn't it?

1065
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:45,790
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one was really good, especially playing Space Harrier.

1066
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:53,001
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably shouldn't be getting to this because I'm such a big fanboy that I could talk for hours about the game.

1067
01:06:53,562 --> 01:06:54,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying that.

1068
01:06:55,031 --> 01:06:55,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And one last thing.

1069
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:59,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I think next weekend there's going to be a fighting game tournament in Toronto.

1070
01:06:59,332 --> 01:06:59,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fun.

1071
01:07:00,372 --> 01:07:01,352
[SPEAKER_01]: In York University.

1072
01:07:02,693 --> 01:07:05,673
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you are interested, it's like five bucks or ten bucks to get in.

1073
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:06,473
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like three days.

1074
01:07:07,114 --> 01:07:09,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be, you know, crazy full of people.

1075
01:07:09,514 --> 01:07:12,815
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to try to, since my flight arrives on Saturday, I'm going to try to go straight there.

1076
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, give us a call and let us know how it goes.

1077
01:07:15,675 --> 01:07:17,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout OLR really loud.

1078
01:07:18,376 --> 01:07:20,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll call in, you know, next Sunday.

1079
01:07:21,156 --> 01:07:21,477
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1080
01:07:21,517 --> 01:07:21,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

1081
01:07:21,957 --> 01:07:23,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for the call, FootyMonster.

1082
01:07:23,237 --> 01:07:23,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

1083
01:07:24,557 --> 01:07:25,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you guys too.

1084
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, bye-bye.

1085
01:07:26,758 --> 01:07:26,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1086
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:58,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to hear the report too from an anime vet.

1087
01:07:58,595 --> 01:08:04,160
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100, Matt, you're suddenly my hero for saying Admiral Ackbar's cereal is greater than Night Trap 2.

1088
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:11,648
[SPEAKER_06]: We watched that right before you showed up at the 4th of July party.

1089
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:14,070
[SPEAKER_06]: We watched the Star Wars Robot Chicken show.

1090
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,941
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1091
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:46,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Boyfriend's really good friend is a physician's assistant, so we always call him for drug advice, like, what should I be taking, because I have a killer headache.

1092
01:08:46,306 --> 01:08:46,746
[SPEAKER_10]: And it worked.

1093
01:08:47,326 --> 01:08:49,627
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I don't see Ranma calling back, so at least we'll go to another call.

1094
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1095
01:08:51,007 --> 01:08:51,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1096
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:53,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob.

1097
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:55,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Able to Think from the forums.

1098
01:08:55,728 --> 01:08:56,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, let me mute my thing.

1099
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:58,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Able to Think.

1100
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:02,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you a first-time caller?

1101
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:04,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I am.

1102
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, welcome to the show.

1103
01:09:05,691 --> 01:09:06,331
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

1104
01:09:06,371 --> 01:09:06,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for calling.

1105
01:09:08,413 --> 01:09:22,665
[SPEAKER_03]: That psycho lady from Australia who decided to try to abduct... Well, technically abduct the kid from whatever state that was.

1106
01:09:22,705 --> 01:09:24,186
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of gross.

1107
01:09:24,746 --> 01:09:26,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what is up with that?

1108
01:09:26,148 --> 01:09:28,149
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want to say about that?

1109
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:32,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, does that just not make you feel good in your tummy?

1110
01:09:32,713 --> 01:09:33,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it make you sick?

1111
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:36,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me want to go...

1112
01:09:36,929 --> 01:09:42,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Grab a shotgun and hopefully... Well now wait a minute, careful what you say on an internet radio program.

1113
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:44,497
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be shot with happy lasers.

1114
01:09:44,757 --> 01:09:48,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's right, you want to shoot with flowers and rose petals.

1115
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:49,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Bunch of flowers!

1116
01:09:51,023 --> 01:09:53,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, if a lady like that came to my door, I'd probably freak.

1117
01:09:55,191 --> 01:10:04,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but the thing that pisses me off about it is that it gives World of Warcraft a bad name because nobody stops to think that, oh, this is just some crazy bitch.

1118
01:10:04,396 --> 01:10:10,099
[SPEAKER_10]: But they go, oh, well, they met on World of Warcraft, so obviously all the crazies are on World of Warcraft.

1119
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is somewhat true.

1120
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,562
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a lot of crazies on World of Warcraft, but we're not all crazy.

1121
01:10:16,862 --> 01:10:17,363
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that, buddy?

1122
01:10:18,743 --> 01:10:23,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you mean video games in general because that seems to be whatever everybody thinks.

1123
01:10:24,215 --> 01:10:27,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever anything goes wrong with society, it's all video games' fault.

1124
01:10:28,477 --> 01:10:28,997
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

1125
01:10:29,357 --> 01:10:29,917
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens.

1126
01:10:31,878 --> 01:10:35,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And our crazy psycho lawyer friend's name we must not mention.

1127
01:10:35,379 --> 01:10:36,259
[SPEAKER_10]: That's absolutely right.

1128
01:10:36,419 --> 01:10:36,740
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1129
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,220
[SPEAKER_10]: It drives us nuts.

1130
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what are you looking forward to at E3 next week?

1131
01:10:42,842 --> 01:10:43,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1132
01:10:44,182 --> 01:10:49,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see if Nintendo announces a Wii Hard Drive.

1133
01:10:50,945 --> 01:10:51,885
[SPEAKER_03]: A Wii Hard Drive?

1134
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:54,448
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell would they use it for?

1135
01:10:56,389 --> 01:10:57,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Virtual console games.

1136
01:10:57,509 --> 01:11:11,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they have an Xbox Live service coming on, then they're going to need to get it so you can have more space or else you're not going to be able to fit all your games on there.

1137
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:17,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Or how about they use the SD memory card slot that they have on there and don't seem to use for anything.

1138
01:11:19,357 --> 01:11:19,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well...

1139
01:11:24,988 --> 01:11:31,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they'll use it for all that download content that's available on WeConnect24.

1140
01:11:32,633 --> 01:11:41,959
[SPEAKER_08]: I know my flash drive is teeming with tons and tons and tons and tons of content, so much so that I don't get around to playing any of it.

1141
01:11:42,489 --> 01:11:43,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, who knows?

1142
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:50,514
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the Magic 8-Ball says not bloody likely on that, but who knew that Nintendo would put out a two-screen system with a touchscreen?

1143
01:11:50,534 --> 01:11:52,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, crazier things have happened.

1144
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:54,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1145
01:11:55,817 --> 01:11:57,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm done, too.

1146
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an FU.

1147
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that okay if I FU something?

1148
01:12:01,941 --> 01:12:02,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Really quick, sure.

1149
01:12:04,343 --> 01:12:06,384
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to spin markers because they cheat.

1150
01:12:06,404 --> 01:12:07,905
[SPEAKER_03]: They spin markers.

1151
01:12:07,945 --> 01:12:09,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't spin my fingers.

1152
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:10,831
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're giving F.U.

1153
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:11,611
[SPEAKER_10]: an 0 and on 2.

1154
01:12:12,892 --> 01:12:14,273
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the problem with the spin markers?

1155
01:12:15,854 --> 01:12:19,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, see, it's like a nice lady.

1156
01:12:19,136 --> 01:12:21,598
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get their sweet spot or else it doesn't work.

1157
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Very well put, my friend.

1158
01:12:26,081 --> 01:12:26,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Very well put.

1159
01:12:26,701 --> 01:12:28,182
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we've got to let you go, though, buddy.

1160
01:12:28,202 --> 01:12:33,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for the call, but we're going to try and get Ranma one more time here, and we'll talk to you again, okay?

1161
01:12:34,286 --> 01:12:34,507
[SPEAKER_10]: See you.

1162
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:35,507
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thanks for the call.

1163
01:12:36,888 --> 01:12:37,829
[SPEAKER_10]: We like hearing from noobs.

1164
01:12:38,697 --> 01:12:39,817
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always good to hear from new people.

1165
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:40,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, damn it.

1166
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:43,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Just as I went to the tab that Arama's call, he dropped.

1167
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:44,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah.

1168
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:45,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there he is again.

1169
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's try it again.

1170
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,041
[SPEAKER_10]: One more time.

1171
01:12:48,061 --> 01:12:48,821
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1172
01:12:48,841 --> 01:12:49,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1173
01:12:50,422 --> 01:12:51,302
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Ranma.

1174
01:12:51,342 --> 01:12:52,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me now?

1175
01:12:52,082 --> 01:12:52,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God.

1176
01:12:52,622 --> 01:12:53,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we can.

1177
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:54,203
[SPEAKER_10]: We can hear you.

1178
01:12:54,243 --> 01:12:55,203
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1179
01:12:55,784 --> 01:12:56,884
[SPEAKER_10]: This better be good.

1180
01:12:58,005 --> 01:12:58,245
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1181
01:12:58,285 --> 01:13:01,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll call it with my anime next con report.

1182
01:13:01,866 --> 01:13:03,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you this right now.

1183
01:13:03,287 --> 01:13:06,828
[SPEAKER_05]: For a local con, it was pretty much off the walls.

1184
01:13:07,725 --> 01:13:09,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, that's a glowing reveal.

1185
01:13:09,106 --> 01:13:09,566
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened?

1186
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,026
[SPEAKER_10]: What made this con so freaking great?

1187
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:16,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one of the main important things about cons is it's just as good as the friends who were there.

1188
01:13:17,188 --> 01:13:23,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess with me, when I got there, I knew like half the people there, you know, getting stopped, like, hey, how are you and stuff.

1189
01:13:23,171 --> 01:13:32,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that it's like, the way that the con is laid out, you have the Expo Center, like six, seven hotels in the area, everybody's hanging out at the Hollywood front lawns.

1190
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:34,611
[SPEAKER_05]: or to hang out from the Expo Center.

1191
01:13:34,812 --> 01:13:39,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you go on the inside, you see like a lot of video game cosplay, which was really awesome in my book.

1192
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:42,778
[SPEAKER_10]: So was there a lot of gaming content at this con?

1193
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:46,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the way Sakura made it sound, it wasn't too much on the gaming.

1194
01:13:47,883 --> 01:13:49,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do know this much.

1195
01:13:49,284 --> 01:13:53,307
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically got rid of the DDR room and replaced it with Guitar Hero.

1196
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:59,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I guess you kind of seen that slowly happening at a lot of cons and pretty soon Rock Band, huh?

1197
01:14:00,558 --> 01:14:02,400
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's called Sprint Network

1198
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris Patton, Monica Rial, ADV, Funimation

1199
01:14:49,935 --> 01:15:14,439
[SPEAKER_05]: and the big thing that's always is Final Fantasy which is a gig but that's starting to kind of dwindle down now you see a lot of more stuff that's coming I saw a lot of Lucky Star cosplay I still see some SMA which is still somewhat popular interesting huh very cool alright well anything else any funny funny things happen at the con you want to share with us especially funny moments

1200
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:24,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was at the bed dog, which is the staff party, and the Las Vegas rule was put in effect.

1201
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really can't tell you about that, but I can say this.

1202
01:15:27,796 --> 01:15:33,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of my funny experiences is that running into people that I know, and I'm like, do I know you?

1203
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now I know who you are.

1204
01:15:36,002 --> 01:15:39,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Different costume, different makeup, and it's like, ah, I see.

1205
01:15:40,364 --> 01:15:42,966
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens at anime cons stays at anime cons, huh?

1206
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, especially when you're taking shots of Silco.

1207
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:50,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, alright, don't have too much fun over there, okay?

1208
01:15:51,943 --> 01:15:52,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want any luck.

1209
01:15:52,743 --> 01:15:54,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on my way back when I was trying to call.

1210
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:56,104
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1211
01:15:56,205 --> 01:15:56,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

1212
01:15:57,745 --> 01:16:00,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on my way back from the party when I was trying to call.

1213
01:16:01,227 --> 01:16:03,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, well, maybe that explains some of the difficulty we had earlier.

1214
01:16:03,548 --> 01:16:07,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling and giving us your report, okay?

1215
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:09,230
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

1216
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:09,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

1217
01:16:10,131 --> 01:16:10,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, later.

1218
01:16:11,789 --> 01:16:19,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1219
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:22,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

1220
01:16:22,592 --> 01:16:23,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, who's this?

1221
01:16:23,492 --> 01:16:24,232
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1222
01:16:25,052 --> 01:16:27,093
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Sinan from Finland.

1223
01:16:27,773 --> 01:16:30,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow, we love getting listeners from far away.

1224
01:16:30,394 --> 01:16:32,634
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, my Finnish friend?

1225
01:16:34,275 --> 01:16:39,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have all that much in mind, I think, because it's early in the morning over here.

1226
01:16:40,379 --> 01:16:42,800
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you've been staying up very late to listen to us live.

1227
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:43,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we appreciate it.

1228
01:16:44,681 --> 01:16:49,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was off to work at the beginning, but I've been here one hour now, I think.

1229
01:16:50,343 --> 01:16:51,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, very cool.

1230
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, has there been a topic tonight that you wanted to chime in on?

1231
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:55,345
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1232
01:16:56,866 --> 01:16:57,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

1233
01:16:57,746 --> 01:17:03,629
[SPEAKER_07]: While at work, I listen to the five... What the fuck is this sound I'm hearing?

1234
01:17:03,809 --> 01:17:06,950
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Rob being silly.

1235
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:08,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you're hearing us echoing.

1236
01:17:08,431 --> 01:17:08,771
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.

1237
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:14,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we've had someone call in just to say, hey, who's up?

1238
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:23,237
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really because I listened to the five-year anniversary show, and I thought I would just drop in a line.

1239
01:17:23,297 --> 01:17:29,062
[SPEAKER_07]: After all, I got back from work, and I thought that maybe I could call in now and never again listen live.

1240
01:17:30,263 --> 01:17:32,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, did you enjoy the five-year anniversary show?

1241
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:34,484
[SPEAKER_07]: E3 Big News

1242
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:58,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of course, it's always better, except for now, isn't it smaller nowadays?

1243
01:17:58,863 --> 01:18:01,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a little bit, but it's still all the same news.

1244
01:18:01,624 --> 01:18:05,706
[SPEAKER_10]: The show itself might be small, but the news, I believe, is still going to stay the same.

1245
01:18:06,106 --> 01:18:09,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything that you hope will happen at this year's E3?

1246
01:18:10,427 --> 01:18:15,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope there will be some good information about Fallout 3, because that's a game I'm very interested in.

1247
01:18:15,969 --> 01:18:17,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, Fallout 3, what is it about Fallout 3?

1248
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:22,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you a fan of the first two games, or have you just seen the screenshots, you're excited?

1249
01:18:23,092 --> 01:18:24,272
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it about Fallout that you love?

1250
01:18:25,461 --> 01:18:29,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a huge Fallout fan, which means that Fallout 3 I'm pretty scared about.

1251
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:31,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be shit.

1252
01:18:31,466 --> 01:18:34,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you think that Fallout 3 is going to be shit?

1253
01:18:35,509 --> 01:18:36,970
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be Oblivion with guns.

1254
01:18:38,892 --> 01:18:39,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Oblivion with guns.

1255
01:18:39,713 --> 01:18:41,494
[SPEAKER_10]: But Oblivion's a freaking great game.

1256
01:18:41,734 --> 01:18:46,178
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess, you know, maybe that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to translate well into a series like Fallout.

1257
01:18:47,058 --> 01:18:47,859
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't think so.

1258
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:50,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't really like Oblivion either.

1259
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:51,722
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't like Oblivion?

1260
01:18:53,063 --> 01:18:53,704
[SPEAKER_07]: No, of course not.

1261
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:54,665
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you playing it on?

1262
01:18:54,685 --> 01:18:55,145
[SPEAKER_06]: What system?

1263
01:18:56,398 --> 01:19:01,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been playing it, that's why I don't like it.

1264
01:19:01,221 --> 01:19:05,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I'm thinking of a different game.

1265
01:19:06,104 --> 01:19:06,525
[SPEAKER_10]: It's alright.

1266
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,246
[SPEAKER_10]: It's getting late over here, too.

1267
01:19:08,806 --> 01:19:13,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, anything else you wanted to share with us quickly tonight before we let you go?

1268
01:19:17,492 --> 01:19:18,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, I don't think so.

1269
01:19:18,832 --> 01:19:19,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, that's alright.

1270
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:20,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for calling.

1271
01:19:20,754 --> 01:19:21,914
[SPEAKER_10]: It was certainly an entertaining call.

1272
01:19:21,934 --> 01:19:22,835
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it, okay?

1273
01:19:23,596 --> 01:19:24,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so.

1274
01:19:24,437 --> 01:19:24,717
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1275
01:19:24,737 --> 01:19:27,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if I can catch some other shows some other time.

1276
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:27,640
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1277
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

1278
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:34,406
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know you have to stay up late to listen live, so we appreciate that true fandom over there overseas on this other side of the pond.

1279
01:19:35,507 --> 01:19:35,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1280
01:19:35,987 --> 01:19:36,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Two ponds.

1281
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:37,088
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1282
01:19:37,108 --> 01:19:37,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1283
01:19:37,288 --> 01:19:37,769
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1284
01:19:38,309 --> 01:19:41,512
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just a hop, skip, and a jump in an 18-hour flight, right?

1285
01:19:41,592 --> 01:19:41,832
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1286
01:19:42,293 --> 01:19:42,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

1287
01:19:43,734 --> 01:19:43,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1288
01:19:44,054 --> 01:19:44,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

1289
01:19:44,455 --> 01:19:44,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

1290
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:45,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1291
01:19:45,496 --> 01:19:45,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

1292
01:19:49,022 --> 01:19:50,044
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1293
01:20:01,155 --> 01:20:01,815
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1294
01:20:22,816 --> 01:20:27,398
[SPEAKER_08]: There's rumors going around that Rock Band may be an Xbox 360 timed exclusive game.

1295
01:20:27,538 --> 01:20:40,343
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason being is because the invitation to their Rock Band E3 presentation had the Xbox 360 logo on there, but amazingly enough, the PlayStation logo was not on there.

1296
01:20:41,043 --> 01:20:41,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Could it be a mistake?

1297
01:20:42,644 --> 01:20:42,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1298
01:20:43,444 --> 01:20:50,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I know from all the videos that we've seen from, I think, the EA event, the game was being played on an Xbox 360 dev kit.

1299
01:20:51,974 --> 01:20:54,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuntman Ignition Atari Classics Gamefly

1300
01:21:19,514 --> 01:21:35,060
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the past we've noticed that of course Gamefly has a lot of titles of stuff that have leaked like beautiful Katamari before people notice or before they have the official announcement.

1301
01:21:36,161 --> 01:21:37,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what else here.

1302
01:21:38,222 --> 01:21:44,224
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a rumor also going around that Mario Kart Wii may be coming out this year but in Europe.

1303
01:21:45,044 --> 01:21:46,125
[SPEAKER_08]: The rumor is that

1304
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,552
[SPEAKER_08]: The US will be getting Smash Bros.

1305
01:21:49,652 --> 01:21:54,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl in 07 and Mario Kart in 08.

1306
01:21:54,315 --> 01:21:56,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Europe will be getting the opposite.

1307
01:21:56,617 --> 01:21:59,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario Kart in 07 and Smash Bros.

1308
01:21:59,299 --> 01:21:59,379
[SPEAKER_08]: in 08.

1309
01:21:59,599 --> 01:21:59,979
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this?

1310
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:01,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo's apology to Europe?

1311
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1312
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:03,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I want fucking Mario Kart.

1313
01:22:03,482 --> 01:22:04,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck this Smash Bros.

1314
01:22:04,683 --> 01:22:04,863
[SPEAKER_08]: shit.

1315
01:22:04,903 --> 01:22:06,644
[SPEAKER_08]: You can all wait for Smash Bros.

1316
01:22:06,744 --> 01:22:08,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want my cake and I'm going to eat it too.

1317
01:22:08,726 --> 01:22:09,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I want both cakes.

1318
01:22:09,266 --> 01:22:10,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I want more Mario Kart.

1319
01:22:10,887 --> 01:22:12,469
[SPEAKER_08]: And then...

1320
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:20,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Battalion Wars 2 has been pushed back to October 29th.

1321
01:22:20,683 --> 01:22:26,866
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes that interesting, though, is there's no Wii game coming out in September.

1322
01:22:28,227 --> 01:22:42,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you think about it, and this is all speculation, but if you think about it, and they wanted a pretty strong Wii title to compete against Halo 3 and whatnot, that would be the perfect prime spot for Super Smash Bros.

1323
01:22:42,234 --> 01:22:42,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl.

1324
01:22:43,787 --> 01:22:44,867
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1325
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:45,907
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

1326
01:22:47,268 --> 01:22:48,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, you have anything?

1327
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:48,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't.

1328
01:22:48,628 --> 01:22:48,808
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1329
01:22:49,368 --> 01:22:49,548
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1330
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:50,988
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a very firm no.

1331
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:51,909
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1332
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:56,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Then let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts because we're going to wrap up here and end the show.

1333
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:59,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for being here, Jonas, Explicit.

1334
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:01,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you didn't get a chance to say too much tonight.

1335
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:01,591
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.

1336
01:23:01,631 --> 01:23:04,911
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you came in when things were already running, but we appreciate you helping out with Listless.

1337
01:23:05,311 --> 01:23:07,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Any last final thoughts for our listeners?

1338
01:23:08,872 --> 01:23:11,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I understand you guys wanted to go to E3.

1339
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:12,733
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's always next year.

1340
01:23:13,093 --> 01:23:13,433
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1341
01:23:14,252 --> 01:23:14,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Some other year.

1342
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:15,232
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

1343
01:23:15,252 --> 01:23:15,833
[SPEAKER_10]: We're having fun.

1344
01:23:16,113 --> 01:23:19,094
[SPEAKER_10]: We're having fun stomping and throwing a fit this year.

1345
01:23:19,114 --> 01:23:19,534
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine.

1346
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:23,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, by the way, was it FU's of the week earlier today?

1347
01:23:23,316 --> 01:23:23,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I missed them.

1348
01:23:23,876 --> 01:23:24,977
[SPEAKER_10]: They were early in the show.

1349
01:23:24,997 --> 01:23:25,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to say.

1350
01:23:26,137 --> 01:23:26,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not angsty, so.

1351
01:23:27,017 --> 01:23:29,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I was going to say you can quickly throw one out as your final thought.

1352
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:35,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the only FU I had was Anime Expo 07's organization this year.

1353
01:23:36,562 --> 01:23:41,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Being an owner organized and having the staff pro screwed all over for everybody else.

1354
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:42,903
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1355
01:23:42,923 --> 01:23:43,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially with the scheduling.

1356
01:23:43,984 --> 01:23:46,125
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not been hearing good things about what went down there.

1357
01:23:46,145 --> 01:23:52,309
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, everyone heard about the whole petition of trying to move Anime Expo 08 out of Los Angeles Convention Center.

1358
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:53,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1359
01:23:53,710 --> 01:24:02,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, there's been extreme amounts of debates over it, being how it's unsafe, and how the hotels are like two blocks away from them.

1360
01:24:03,356 --> 01:24:04,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I say move it back to Disneyland.

1361
01:24:05,878 --> 01:24:06,498
[SPEAKER_10]: They love that.

1362
01:24:06,798 --> 01:24:07,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

1363
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:08,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell no.

1364
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:09,260
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a nightmare.

1365
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:13,826
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

1366
01:24:14,586 --> 01:24:15,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to Disneyland, bitches.

1367
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:24,890
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is I want candy very badly, even though I shouldn't be eating more candy, but I really want candy.

1368
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:27,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget about Sack Enemy this week.

1369
01:24:27,491 --> 01:24:28,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't, I won't.

1370
01:24:28,492 --> 01:24:29,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought?

1371
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:30,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Last but certainly not least, Loki.

1372
01:24:32,773 --> 01:24:33,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a kitty.

1373
01:24:35,254 --> 01:24:36,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Named after an Atari emulator.

1374
01:24:37,011 --> 01:24:38,591
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1375
