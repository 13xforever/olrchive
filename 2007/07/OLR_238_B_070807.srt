00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,960
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,800
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday evening.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,800
It is July the 8th of 2007 and of course Orange Lounge Radio tapes live on Sunday nights and

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,920
releases our show in two parts to our RSS feed twice weekly and about the time you're

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,160
getting this right now, E3 is going on and of course as we talked about in part A, one

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,600
of the things that Sony is most likely going to be announcing at E3 is a $100 price drop

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,960
for the PlayStation 3.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,760
However, as we do record the show live on Sunday nights, sometimes things change as

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,080
the show is going on.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Yes, Loki?

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,200
Yes, it's not a secret anymore.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,740
It is official.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,960
They have announced that the PlayStation 3 will be dropping or I should say the PlayStation

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,560
360 system will be dropping to $499 actually this week.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
The other announcement though is coming in August, they're going to be releasing the

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,920
80 gig model that's going to be also bundled with a retail copy of Motorstorm.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,000
That is going to be at the $599 price point.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,520
So everybody loves that $599 price point but at least it's nice to see that they're bundling

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,320
a game in there as well.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,480
I don't know, a little bit more for your money but still not a whole lot.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,680
But that's probably going to be announced again at E3 and during Sony's so-called

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,780
press conference but just thought we'd like to let you guys know about that.

27
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,080
Now onto other things, of course with E3 right around the corner, one thing that we loved

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,880
last year and they're doing it again is Microsoft is going to be doing that bringing

29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:59,380
it home thing where they actually have videos and demos from the show floor almost.

30
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:06,960
Last year we got to play Test Drive Unlimited and MotoGP 2006 and there was one other one

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
in there, I don't know, fun stuff.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
So this year though, who knows what we're going to get but we're going to get more

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,700
of that, more demos, more game trailers and stuff like that, more free themes hopefully

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,880
and also they're not the only ones doing that.

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,640
This year Sony is jumping on the bandwagon, so they say, and are going to be doing something

36
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,720
very similar on the PlayStation Network as well, you're going to have downloadable

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,160
demos and videos and whatnot.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,240
So awesome, I can't wait to download new demos because I like playing demos.

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,320
Do you think, just indulge me here as silly as this thought might be, do you think that

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,420
Microsoft might pull out a price drop of their own?

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,760
Possibly.

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
They're not going to just be like, whatever.

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,080
I don't think they need to but now that Sony dropped their price, they might pull

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,940
that thing where we think that our price point, even though it's $399, is so competitive

45
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,240
with their price point but they might be going by the elites, still even though their elites

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,320
are $20 less supposedly.

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,360
Do you think they might throw in a free game or something to make them feel more lucrative?

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,080
They may throw in a free game, like maybe Halo, Forza, Halo, something like that.

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,400
I don't know if they'll do Halo but probably Forza or something but there may be a game

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,320
pack-in, there may be also a price drop.

51
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,640
I hope that they do a price drop, it might be pretty cool but I don't know.

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,560
Not guaranteeing anything but I think if they did, it would definitely help.

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,640
SSJ100Matt says, not until after Halo 3 comes out, would there be another price drop?

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,120
They very well might hold it off until after Halo comes out and just say, boom, here you

55
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,320
go, price drop, let's sell some systems.

56
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,600
Let's talk about real quickly another game that a lot of folks are anticipating that's

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,000
going to be getting a demo of its own, it's Blue Dragon.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,640
Of course, a lot of folks are very excited about this because it's not very often you

59
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,760
get a Japanese-style RPG on an Xbox system but we're finally starting to see some this

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,960
year thanks to Eternal Sonata and of course Blue Dragon.

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,240
Eternal Sonata had a demo come out already but Blue Dragon will be getting a demo on

62
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Xbox Live Marketplace July 20th.

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,920
There is a Dengeki online magazine in Japan that is claiming that a 1.1 gigabyte demo

64
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,200
is going to be coming out over here in the US on July 20th.

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,680
It's going to be a two-hour demo if this story is correct.

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,720
It's going to be a pretty intense demo.

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,080
It's only going to be available though for two weeks.

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,440
The demo will disappear on August 3rd.

69
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,360
So now it almost sounds like it's a beta test or something even though it's not an online

70
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
game.

71
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
So I don't know what the hell else to call it.

72
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
It's a limited-time demo.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Kind of interesting.

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,480
It's just an incentive for you to play it, I guess.

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,040
But a two-hour demo?

76
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Really?

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
That's pretty cool.

78
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,400
That sounds like a really good idea, especially if the game is going to be a bunch longer

79
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
than that.

80
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,320
I think they're trying to give a percentage of the game to get an idea of it.

81
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,520
It is supposed to be one of the first Xbox 360 games that's on two disks.

82
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Interesting.

83
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,720
And then I also think about your typical Xbox early adopter is not someone who's typically

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,240
into these type of Japanese RPGs because a lot of folks who have not picked up an Xbox

85
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,440
360 still, they do like these games and aren't impressed with the fact that Microsoft doesn't

86
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
have them out.

87
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,960
So maybe having a very long two-hour demo is kind of a way to show these folks who maybe

88
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,400
bought their Xboxes for the maddens and burnouts of the world, give them their really first

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,560
experience in a Japanese RPG and try to get some people sucked into the world through

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
that.

91
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
I don't know.

92
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Just a thought.

93
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,080
Kind of go back a little bit with the whole PlayStation network doing almost like the

94
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,400
bring it home thing, I really do hope they do this because lately their downloads and

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,480
stuff and their content online has been pretty crappy.

96
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,920
And if they start kicking it up to maybe the Xbox Live level, that would be pretty awesome

97
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,500
and that would definitely help them because I know right now the 360, there's no shortage

98
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,040
of new demos and games coming out each week.

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,000
All right, well I will definitely be looking forward to the Blue Dragon demo and I'll

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,160
be downloading it.

101
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,360
I'm sure as a lot of you folks listen to the show, we'll be.

102
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:32,720
Well speaking of Xbox news, the Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be, excuse me, actually

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:40,200
launched in Japan on October 11th and the price is going to be 47,800 yen, which in

104
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,160
US dollars is 390, so they're getting it cheaper than we did.

105
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Good for them I guess.

106
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,520
Well I guess they need to be selling more Xboxes over in Japan, so why not release it

107
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
deep, eh?

108
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
They're trying.

109
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,800
All right, well if you're in Japan and you've been holding out for an Xbox 360, maybe now

110
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,680
is the time, who knows.

111
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,660
Well, kind of continuing on with the trend of exclusive games being lost, or not exclusive

112
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,040
games being lost, but becoming exclusive for the 360 or being delayed on the PlayStation

113
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,120
3, Fatal Inertia, this game has been delayed for a while, it's supposed to be I think a

114
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:24,480
launch title for the PlayStation 3 and now it's finally going to be coming out in September.

115
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,800
Now the only problem though is the PlayStation 3 version has been delayed indefinitely, so

116
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:37,160
the Xbox 360 one will be arriving September 11th on my birthday, awesome, and PlayStation

117
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,800
3 possibly later on if it's not canceled by then.

118
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Very interesting.

119
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,720
I mean, there's been plenty of games like this, Splinter Cell, Devil Agent, Ghost Recon

120
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,800
Advanced Warfighter 2, hell, Rainbow Six Vegas, just kind of continuing the trend that the

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,560
PlayStation 3 is hard to develop for.

122
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,860
This is very interesting, kind of taking another topic here from Xbox 360 world, Forza 2.

123
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,040
You know, you can create your own cars in Forza 2, right?

124
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,800
And you can create these cars and you can actually sell them in their little online

125
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
auction.

126
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,520
Well, I'm surprised it took this long for a story like this to come out, but some knucklehead

127
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,400
has put up this car that says, White Power, Hail Hitler, you know, all that crap.

128
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,760
It's probably some 13-year-old trying to look cool, which this is not cool, but you know,

129
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,080
somebody made this car and put it up, there's a huge swastika on the hood and everything,

130
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,520
ah, just all this crap, they put up there on the little online marketplace thing within

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Forza, a little online auction where you can buy the cars.

132
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,440
And of course, one of the blogs, it looks like 360 Gamer, got a picture of it, put it

133
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,640
on the internet, of course this exposes this whole problem to what happens when you let

134
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,800
users sell their custom-created cars on the game.

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm surprised it's this and not, you know, a giant twat on the hood of a car or something,

136
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,280
it's all sorts of offensive things.

137
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,120
Fuck me in the butt, like, written on the side of the car.

138
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,400
I mean, this is just the tip of the iceberg, folks.

139
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,280
So how exactly do you stop this from happening?

140
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,120
Does a set of eyes have to look at every car that goes up?

141
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,000
Do you just allow this kind of shit to go on there and hope that people will warn or

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
whatever they need to do?

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,520
What you need to do is they should have something, you know, report abuse or report, you know,

144
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,680
this as a, you know, something like that.

145
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
You know, if it's, do you think if it's breaking, you know, the terms of service or whatever,

146
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,520
have it be reported and then they can take it down, you know, kind of like eBay.

147
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,120
You know, and of course, Microsoft has their whole little online user policy that says

148
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,200
you won't use our services to discriminate against, you know, somebody for a race or

149
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,640
whatever, even though whenever you sign on to Xbox Live and you play some online game,

150
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:57,560
it's usually, you know, NNNNFFFF and all those, you know, words getting dropped like crazy.

151
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,520
Part of the charm, and I say that with over sarcasm there, the charm of Xbox Live, that's

152
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,760
why I only play Xbox Live with friends.

153
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,040
I very rarely will play Xbox Live with strangers, and I rate every single one of them too.

154
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,600
If I play Xbox Live with strangers, they get rated by me every time I rate them good or

155
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I rate them bad.

156
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:22,000
It'll be interesting to see if Sony, what Sony does in their whole future plan for online

157
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
gaming as well.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,960
Well, other stuff.

159
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Yes.

160
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Yes.

161
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,320
Other stuff has to do with Gears of War, the soundtrack.

162
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,240
Usually the game is so popular that they are releasing the score to the game on soundtrack,

163
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,000
you know, with tracks such as Train Ride to Hell.

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
Wow, if I had known there were more songs like that in Gears of War, I might have tried

165
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,760
to play it longer, although it was kind of frustrating me like crazy.

166
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
You know what?

167
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,100
They've been doing soundtracks to video games for years in Japan, and we're just now getting

168
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,160
all this goodness, just in recent years.

169
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,800
We've had some, like you'll get like spotty, like Gran Turismo 2 had a soundtrack, I remember

170
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
that.

171
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
We do get the Silent Hill soundtracks over here.

172
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,240
Yeah, they're very spotty, but you see them once in a while, but of course you think in

173
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,960
Japan, my god, like every role-playing game that's major that come out of there has a

174
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,320
deluxe soundtrack that comes out, five-disc Chrono Trigger soundtrack.

175
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
With art books attached to them, like my Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack.

176
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,700
Kind of interesting that over here you get a Gears of War soundtrack, but you know, the

177
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,600
game's still insanely popular, it's always in that top ten list of the lightest.

178
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,280
Oh, they're doing this though, because these games come out, well I'd be like, well I really

179
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,920
want the music to this, and you know, I've actually got the new whatever Mana game just

180
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
came out soundtrack.

181
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,560
Or how about like Grand Theft Auto, you know, Vice City.

182
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,960
But that was all like actual, you know, radio music.

183
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,680
How sad that they never came out with a box set for Grand Theft Auto 3, that had some

184
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,520
pretty good stuff, especially on that like techno trance station that they had on there.

185
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,640
I think that iTunes also opens the doors for a lot of this too, because there's more and

186
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,520
more game music on iTunes lately.

187
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,360
Like you know, I know we had a story a few weeks ago about how Konami put a lot of their

188
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,580
old classic songs up there, so it's kind of neat what you can find online, and shopping

189
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,360
online as well.

190
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,320
Anyways, interesting things you can find online, excuses as to why the Red Rings of Death come

191
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,000
up on your 360.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,520
One such excuse apparently is surge protectors.

193
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,960
This is coming from gamepolitics.com, apparently somebody has been, or got a response back

194
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,880
from Microsoft saying that the surge protector was the cause of the Red Rings of Death.

195
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,600
And the reason, because the 360 is highly sensitive to reductions in power, even the

196
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,140
slightest cut in power can cause things like the fans and DVD laser to malfunction.

197
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:55,400
Surge protectors can cause this, and probably 90% of the consoles they've seen fail in

198
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,600
6-12 months of being plugged into a surge protector.

199
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,480
I call bullshit, since I believe the problem with 360's air malfunctioning is overheating,

200
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,440
or actually the heat sink on the graphics chip becoming dislodged somehow because it

201
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,040
gets so hot that the actual solder melts.

202
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,760
So I'm not buying it, who cares, they're fixing it, there's a 3 year damn warranty

203
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
on the things.

204
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,880
Yes, we'll be talking more about that later on in the show, Microsoft's response to the

205
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,320
whole Red Rings of Death thing, but first a game, let's play a game, because it's a

206
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,880
little bit of a slow news week thanks to E3 being right around the corner, I mean there

207
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,200
has been some big news this week as things start to leak out before E3, but during a

208
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
slow news week we like to play a game, so tonight we're going to play a little bit of

209
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,380
Listless.

210
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,320
And the way that Listless works you guys, we're going to be creating the definitive

211
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,160
list around a certain topic, and the 3 hosts here in studio are going to play, and Jonas

212
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
is here with us, we haven't heard a lot from him in this segment, but he's been sitting

213
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,760
here in studio with us, joined us during part 8, he's here with us, how you doing Jonas?

214
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Doing fine, you?

215
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,480
Alright, very good, explicit, also known as in the online world.

216
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,360
And you're going to be going to SacAnime this weekend too.

217
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,280
Yes, and of course I've talked to you guys about SacAnime, not sure if you guys are going

218
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
to be able to make it.

219
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,120
We'll be there, we don't know about the panel yet though, so let us know.

220
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,680
I'll try as much as I can to get you to get the panel there.

221
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,280
For the whole 3 people in Sacramento listening to this program, because this is a worldwide

222
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
show, but we're hoping to get more.

223
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
That's why we're going.

224
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah, I can help promote this stuff.

225
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Alright, sounds awesome.

226
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,240
Alright, well anyway, we'll talk about that later, but tonight we're going to talk about

227
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,940
Listless, and tonight's topic is the most random thing we'd like to see at E3 this year.

228
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,440
Now this is how it's going to work, now you can do serious things, crazy things, stupid

229
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,640
things, there is no limitation.

230
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,200
You can be serious, you can be stupid, it doesn't matter because ultimately it will

231
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,800
be in the hands of the chat room.

232
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,320
The way this is going to work, I will name my top 3, as will Dark Sakura, Loki, and Explicit.

233
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,440
Is this like a game or just events or things?

234
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,560
It could be anything, it could be an event, something that happens at a press conference

235
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
or it could be a game that's announced or whatever.

236
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,080
So anyway, chat room, if you'd like to make some suggestions, you can start yelling those

237
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,260
out in chat, but chat, you'll actually play an important part, because once we name our

238
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,580
3 lists, then the fun part comes, we're going to go around and each one of us will take

239
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,300
something off of the list.

240
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,440
So that's going to leave us with a list of 8, in chat room you're going to vote for your

241
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,980
favorites, and we will come up with a definitive list based on the chat room vote, that's how

242
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,680
listless works.

243
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
This is an old game we used to do years ago on my college radio show, it's lasted this

244
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
long.

245
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,720
Alright, anyway, so again the topic tonight, the most random thing we'd like to see at

246
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,500
E3 this year, it doesn't matter, be serious, stupid, whatever you want, because the chat

247
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,880
room will ultimately decide what it's going to be.

248
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,400
So let's start it off, explicit, you're our guest tonight, why don't you start us off,

249
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,520
what would be the third most random thing you'd like to see at E3 this year?

250
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,720
Bill Gates getting pied in the face.

251
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,120
Bill Gates getting pied in the face, ok of course that happened once, ok, so it's kind

252
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,320
of, kind of, like go back to, go back to good old times, where you know, people would pie

253
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,400
Bill Gates in the face, ok I like this, I'm going to write that, pie Bill Gates, and what's

254
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,840
what's with the, why do you think someone would want to pie him in the face at E3?

255
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,920
Well I mean it has happened before, ok, and you know everyone's talking about the red

256
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
rings of death.

257
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,400
Oh so you think someone will like, you know maybe a cherry pie, to put a red ring of death

258
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
on his face.

259
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Yes.

260
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,840
Actually I shouldn't say that because somebody's going to totally misinterpret that.

261
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,120
We don't mean someone should actually do this, but it would be kind of, it might happen.

262
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,040
Come on, pies in the face are funny, that's what Bozo the Clown used to do.

263
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,160
Alright, but if you actually do it, it's your ass that's going to jail.

264
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Alright anyhow, low key, if you would, your number 3 thing you would most like to see

265
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,960
happen at E3?

266
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:58,000
Nintendo actually releases online games, or games that are online, Nintendo actually releases

267
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,420
an online game to the shock and awe of many, we knew, oh god this is inevitable, somebody

268
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,760
was going to drop that one on us.

269
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,400
Alright, say no more, alright, well let's see, I'm going to go next, because we'll save

270
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,800
the best for last, Jamie.

271
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,920
Alright my number 3 thing I would like to see happen at E3, I would like to see Sega

272
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,440
publicly apologize for what they did to the Sonic franchise, I would like to see Sega

273
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:30,840
have a press conference and go look, our bad, so that's my number 3 thing.

274
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,480
Um, my number 3, if you're ready.

275
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,560
I am, I was just typing that into the computer, Sega publicly apologized for Sonic, alright

276
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
yes.

277
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm showing up killing everyone from G4.

278
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,200
Lovely so Pyramid Head will come in there with his sexy self and kill everyone from

279
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,880
G4, not really, because again we don't want to get sued or watched by the FBI or anything,

280
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,000
we don't really mean that, but Pyramid Head could, you know, come in there and lay the

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,800
smack down, this is silly or random.

282
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,720
Alright, I hope the chatroom lighted, the Rob D says that is pretty random.

283
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,880
Alright, uh, Jonas, your number 2 most random thing you'd like to see happen at E3.

284
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Alright, okay, um, I have the sense of this because Jamie said the person is banned in

285
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Orange Dawn's radio.

286
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,320
Alright, uh, if it's, if the initials are JT, he who shall not be named, you can use

287
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,800
that or Voldemort.

288
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,600
Him showing up at E3.

289
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:41,600
So Voldemort attends E3.

290
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400
That would be pretty random, what would he be doing at E3, because you know the rumor

291
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,960
is he was going to go to Penny Arcade Expo but they couldn't work out an agreement there,

292
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,760
so what would Lord Voldemort be doing at E3?

293
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,720
Who knows, he'd probably try to censor as many games as possible.

294
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,920
He'd be carrying the pie, that's what it is, that's what will happen.

295
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,320
Alright there you go, uh, Loki, your number 2 most random thing you'd like to see happen

296
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
at E3.

297
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,520
Uh, less of what I, this is more than likely going to happen, um, because, you know, stupid

298
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,760
things come out each year.

299
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,520
But more crappy games announced based off TV series, like, uh, Dancing with the Stars

300
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,000
or um, god, I don't know, are you smarter than a 5th grader?

301
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Hey Paula the game, hey Paula the game, if there is a god in heaven, please do not make

302
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,440
this happen.

303
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,640
Hey Paula the game, uh, let's see, my number 2 thing I would like to see happen at E3,

304
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,400
I would like to see Nintendo not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.

305
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,520
That's what I'd like to see happen for once at E3, I'd like to see Nintendo not announce

306
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,680
one of their systems out in a new color.

307
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,320
I think that's self explanatory.

308
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Jamie?

309
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:57,160
Number 2 should be we, um, be invited to be the official E3 podcasters.

310
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,400
So Jamie's showing a little bit of ego there, OLR the official ambassadors to the podcasting

311
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,560
universe for E3.

312
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,520
So I'm going to put OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors, is that good?

313
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,400
And why would they pick us?

314
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,180
Because of my boobs, I don't know.

315
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,720
So then ambassadors with emphasis on the ass.

316
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Whatever.

317
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:30,120
Alright, OLR sells out at E308, uh, alright number 1, the number 1 thing you would like

318
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,320
to see happen at E3 this year, uh, explicit.

319
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:40,200
Okay, this might get me a little hated here, but um, Halo 3 delayed or cancelled.

320
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,560
Halo 3 delayed or cancelled, that would be pretty funny.

321
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,040
This would be funny, I wanted to see the, what the families would say about this if

322
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
they say it was delayed.

323
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,240
I don't, I don't actually see it, but remember this is random or whatever you want, so this

324
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,880
is your little sick fantasy is that you want to see the Halo fanboys have a cry.

325
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Loki the number 1 thing you would like to see happen at E3 this year.

326
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,440
This honestly is something I really hope to see.

327
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,280
Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.

328
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,200
And it actually sticks.

329
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,680
Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date, or they could come out and say it's out today.

330
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh my god, if they did that on Xbox Live Arcade, oh, oh, that would be awesome.

331
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,680
My number 1 thing is that I would like to see at E3 all the old Kensha Hall exhibitors

332
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,000
picketing outside the auditorium.

333
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,160
Or how about like, you know, pickaxes and torches and...

334
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,760
Because they're chanting, hell no, we won't go, and all that stuff.

335
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Alright, Jamie, your number 1 thing.

336
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,200
Sky's voice the game.

337
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,800
Please explain this classic O.L.

338
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,680
Aryan joke for the sake of our new listeners.

339
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,240
It was Rob singing Bumblebee with different lyrics.

340
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,560
So Konami announces Sky's voice the game.

341
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Yeah.

342
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,040
It's their latest in their Bomani series.

343
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,960
Thank you, my ego feels good for that.

344
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
Alright, there we go, so let's recap the big list we have here.

345
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
This is very wordy, you guys.

346
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,960
You might have to kind of lean in a little bit to see this, but I'll make the font bigger

347
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,800
there so we can all read.

348
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,840
Let me just kind of make that nice and easily readable.

349
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Or not.

350
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
Alright.

351
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Your arm's in the way, Rob.

352
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
That was hard to read.

353
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
I'm sorry, guys.

354
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
We'll, of course, post this in chat.

355
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,940
I can see if your arm wasn't there.

356
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,240
I'm working on it.

357
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,840
Okay, I'm trying to separate some of these out a little bit, the ones that went on two

358
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
lines.

359
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Alright, here we go.

360
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,400
The list as it stands right now.

361
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,880
Most random things we'd like to see happen at E3 2007.

362
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,480
Pie Bill Gates in the face.

363
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,920
Nintendo actually releases an online game.

364
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,600
Sega publicly apologizes for Sonic.

365
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,880
Pyramid Head shows up and kills everyone from G4.

366
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,300
Lord Voldemort goes to E3.

367
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,900
More crappy games based off of TV series, like Hey Paula the Game.

368
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,720
Nintendo not announces one of their systems coming out in a new color.

369
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,360
OLR is named E3 Podcasting Ambassadors.

370
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,880
Halo 3 is delayed or canceled.

371
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,840
Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.

372
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,800
Kensha Hall's exhibitors picket outside the theater.

373
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,840
And Konami announces Sky's Voice the Game as the latest in the Bomani series.

374
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,600
It's a pretty good list.

375
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,580
But unfortunately, this list is not perfect.

376
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,960
So we need to go around and take ones off the list.

377
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,920
So explicit, we'll start with you.

378
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,720
Which one of these items is not worthy of being on the list?

379
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,520
They're all good, but...

380
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
This is hard tonight.

381
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
This is hard tonight.

382
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Yeah, this is hard.

383
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Hmm.

384
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Oh, man.

385
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Take something!

386
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:55,560
I guess I'll have to play the little dance music while Jonas thinks there.

387
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:02,840
I had to go with Nintendo and not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.

388
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,880
Because you know what's inevitable?

389
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,560
That's actually going to happen, right?

390
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Yeah.

391
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,880
Alright, so explicit takes out the line about Nintendo will not actually...

392
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Whatever.

393
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
It's gone.

394
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Doesn't matter anymore.

395
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

396
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,840
No.

397
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,200
Bill Gates getting pied in the face.

398
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,960
Bill Gates is normally not really at these events too much, you know?

399
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,920
If it was like Peter Moore getting pied in the face, maybe.

400
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,480
I don't know.

401
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Alright.

402
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Let's see.

403
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
What would I like to put off the list?

404
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,120
I am going to pull off the list.

405
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,440
I'm going to pull off Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.

406
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,560
Because come on, it's the laughing stock of the industry and we can't have that ruined

407
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
at E3 this year.

408
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
It was a good thought.

409
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
It was a good one.

410
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
This is just hard.

411
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
It's a hard list.

412
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
It's a hard list.

413
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
So, Jamie gets the last to remove.

414
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,240
What are you going to take off the list?

415
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,200
He who shall not be named showing up at E3.

416
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Yeah.

417
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Because it ain't going to happen.

418
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Yeah, we wouldn't want that.

419
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,000
It's invite only, bitch, and you're invited.

420
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,880
We don't get to crash this party.

421
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Alright.

422
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,840
Incoming large paste into chat.

423
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,520
You guys are going to vote for your top two, your number one and your number two.

424
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,760
The order is important.

425
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,880
I will assume your first answer is the number one.

426
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,440
You're going to send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

427
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,320
You know, real quick, sorry, this is kind of an afterthought, but not on the list.

428
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,360
It'd be funny to see the people at Gamecock, the ones doing the EIO thing, to actually

429
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,640
have a Trojan rooster come to the E3 thing and try to see if they can get him to put

430
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
it in there.

431
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,800
Everyone will jump out and, you know, alright.

432
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,280
Here are our finalists for tonight's list list and we're going to open up voting to

433
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,680
the chat room right now.

434
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,480
Vote for your number one and number two picks.

435
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,680
We'll tally them up during the next few stories and reveal the answers to you later in the

436
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
show.

437
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Here we go.

438
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Things we'd like to see at E307.

439
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,760
Nintendo actually releases an online game.

440
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,640
Sega publicly apologizes for what they did to Sonic.

441
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,760
Pyramid Head shows up and kills everyone from G4.

442
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,320
More crappy games based off of TV series.

443
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,640
OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors.

444
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,760
Halo 3 delayed or canceled.

445
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,600
Kensha Hall exhibitors pick it outside the theater.

446
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Sky's voice the game.

447
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,320
Why didn't I take that off the list?

448
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,200
Sky's voice the game announced by Konami.

449
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,760
Alright, there you have it.

450
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,280
Let's get back into the gaming news while the votes come in.

451
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,700
And I'll start off with a story here, kind of going to PC gaming, which we haven't talked

452
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,760
a lot about.

453
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,520
And the quintessential these days PC game, I mean, it is the most popular.

454
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
World of Warcraft.

455
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,560
And of course, if you're a World of Warcraft player, you know that gold farmers are a pain

456
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,160
in your ass.

457
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,600
And Blizzard did a good job with their latest patch though.

458
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,040
They really managed to squelch the amount of spam that was going out thanks to the limitations

459
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,760
they made on trial accounts.

460
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,440
But that just means the gold farmers have gotten a little more creative.

461
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,240
I am actually still getting tell spam once in a great while from gold farmers, but it's

462
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,560
gone way down.

463
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,920
But this has got to be one of the most creative things we've seen in a long time.

464
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:03,080
And that is that these folks now are creating level one gnome characters and killing themselves

465
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,240
in the main alliance town of Ironforge and spelling out the name of their website.

466
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,080
I'm not going to read the name of the website, but you can see pictures around the internet.

467
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,720
All these corpses laid out in like.com such and such site.

468
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,480
I don't want to plug the site because they're cunts for doing this to the game and need

469
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,680
to just stay the hell out of the game.

470
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,280
But you have to give them props at least for being creative.

471
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,840
Why can't we see this kind of advertising in real life?

472
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,260
Blizzard, by the way, one of their reps wrote on their own forums, I ask that any player

473
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,600
that witnesses these to report them straight away.

474
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,480
If you feel so inclined, you can also post the realm name and zone here and I can see

475
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,160
what can be done about getting them handled that way.

476
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,760
Please once it's reported, leave the bodies alone, do not linger around or huddle near

477
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
the bodies.

478
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,640
In other words, don't give them the attention that they're looking for.

479
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,320
Apparently I read somewhere else, somebody actually caught one of these like midway through

480
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,520
like it stopped and like you just see all these bodies saying.com, you don't see the

481
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,080
rest of the site name because I guess the Blizzard folks banned the IPs for too long,

482
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,680
but kind of a creative way to get around.

483
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,080
If nothing else, it's very creative.

484
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,720
I'll give them that even if they are annoying as hell.

485
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,640
Going to the chat room, James Patrick says, that's awesome, dead body advertising is great.

486
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,400
Sephiroth1215 says, yeah, it kind of sucks, but for those sad lives of WoW players, it

487
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
is really funny.

488
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Hey, wait a minute.

489
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
That's me you're talking about.

490
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Jerk.

491
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
All right.

492
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
More news.

493
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Well, I tell you votes.

494
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:37,520
Well, for anyone who plays Second Life, apparently there is now going to be a build of Tokyo

495
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,880
in Second Life done by Tetsuya Mizuguchi.

496
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:51,560
He's doing actually a reimagined Tokyo for the I'm trying to actually get a little bit

497
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
more on that.

498
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Right.

499
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,560
They're doing it actually completely recreated Tokyo from what it's saying.

500
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:04,440
He wants to do what Tokyo appears to both locals and visitors, something that's a matter

501
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,080
of perception.

502
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,160
So as he's quoted, actually saying a museum of Japanese pop culture.

503
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,000
So yeah.

504
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Kind of interesting.

505
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'd like to see how that turns out.

506
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes, very.

507
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,720
Even though I don't really want to play Second Life.

508
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:26,320
Anyways, interesting thing also coming to PCs, Dead or Alive Online is coming to PCs

509
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,640
pretty soon and it's supposed to be a brand new game in the series.

510
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,080
It won't just be some stupid port and so yeah, you will be able to see the Dead or

511
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:44,680
Alive jubilees, I guess, bouncing up and down on your PC in high res.

512
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Hooray.

513
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,840
But you like that, yes?

514
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Oh yeah.

515
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Don't get me wrong.

516
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
It's awesome.

517
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:57,560
Unfortunately, as it is on PC, it's been done before by other companies and they've actually

518
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,000
had it where you can strip clothes off of people and stuff while you're fighting in

519
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
the game.

520
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,360
Well, hey, this Dead or Alive game, of course, there's a lot of Dead or Alive games on the

521
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,240
Xbox 360, but thanks to the red rings of death, some folks have not been able to play them.

522
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,040
Well, the internet threw a fit, even the UK was starting to investigate Microsoft and

523
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,580
finally Microsoft this week said, all right, enough.

524
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
We fucked up.

525
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,800
We're sorry.

526
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,720
Peter Moore came out and said, quote, you've spoken and we've heard you.

527
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,880
Good service and a good customer experience are areas of the business that we care deeply

528
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
about.

529
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,280
Basically, we've not been doing a good enough job.

530
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,460
As of today, all Xbox 360 consoles are covered by an enhanced warranty program to address

531
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,520
specifically the general hardware failures indicated by the three flashing red lights

532
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,600
on the console.

533
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,360
This applies to new and previously sold consoles.

534
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,760
So in other words, for three years, and the Xbox 360 hasn't even been out that long yet,

535
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
your console's covered.

536
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,600
If you get the three rings of death, you don't have to pay to have it fixed.

537
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,800
That means all the people who bought extended warranties.

538
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,120
Well, they may cover other failure.

539
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,160
This is only for the three red rings of death, so the extended warranty does cover all the

540
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,960
other things that could go wrong, but certainly a lot of folks are applauding Microsoft for

541
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
this move.

542
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,520
Now, it would be nice if the three red rings of death would never show up in the first

543
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,880
place, but since Microsoft can't magically cure all the 360s that are already out there,

544
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,520
I suppose this is the next best thing.

545
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,280
Any thoughts from the folks here in studio on the whole warranty policy change?

546
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,680
I think it's pretty cool.

547
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,520
Glad to see that they're actually covering this stuff anyways.

548
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,320
And then hopefully, I'm assuming since the rumors have been going around that they're

549
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,680
redesigning the cooling on it, that this will fix the problem, and any of these consoles

550
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,520
that are still out there that are failing because of this will get fixed, and we won't

551
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,080
have to hear about it anymore.

552
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,120
Apparently Peter Moore has actually joined our chat room, or someone impersonating him.

553
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,160
Peter Moore says, we're sorry, have this three year warranty for the three red lights.

554
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,240
See, one year for every light, there you go, bravo.

555
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Nice.

556
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,320
So, there are three lights?

557
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,520
I guess, yeah, I got the error one time.

558
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,280
I'm joking, Rob.

559
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
I hate you.

560
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
You know what?

561
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Mailbag segment's canceled tonight.

562
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Okay.

563
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
You can read it.

564
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
No, I don't want to read it.

565
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,000
I had to read it last week because you weren't here.

566
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
When you send in your emails to mailbag at OrangeLivesReader.com, obviously we care very

567
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,160
deeply about your emails that you send in to us.

568
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,880
We fight over who gets to read them here on air.

569
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,300
Dark Sakura's going to open up the old mailbag and read some of her favorites for you right

570
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,160
here in the mailbag segment.

571
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,840
Dark Sakura, dive in head first.

572
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Mailbag at OrangeLivesReader.com.

573
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Pull some emails out.

574
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,560
What'd you get?

575
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,840
The first one comes from Devin.

576
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,320
Dear Rob, Jamie, and Loki, last week you put out the call for developers to listen to the

577
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,980
show to write in, and in that regard, I qualified.

578
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,380
Three weeks ago, I started working at Bottle Rocket Entertainment.

579
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:59,000
The team responsible for the Mark of Kree and its sequel on PS2 as an environment artist.

580
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, that's cool.

581
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,800
For the people unsure what that entails, it's pretty much what it sounds like.

582
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,600
Environment artists build the art assets for the level in the game.

583
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,840
Since I just started recently, I have no grizzled words from the trenches of the horrors of

584
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,000
game development, but I wanted to write in anyway as I've been listening to your show

585
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
since last fall.

586
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,720
Actually, I wanted to thank you guys for the work that you do.

587
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,600
I listen to OLR and other podcasts at work, and it makes my day that much more enjoyable.

588
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,200
In fact, aside from the caffeine, I basically had to subsist on podcasts to get me through

589
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,160
the last bit of art school before I got this job.

590
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,000
I love OLR in particular because your enthusiasm for your program shows, and as a result, every

591
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,600
episode is guaranteed to entertain.

592
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Thank you for all the work you put into this.

593
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
One last thing.

594
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,000
My point of view of game development might be somewhat myopic at this point, but I know

595
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,060
people have questions, and I might be able to provide some answers.

596
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,520
I can't talk about anything related to the projects we're working on, but if any of your

597
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,760
listeners want to know what it's like working in a game company or how best to break into

598
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,160
the industry or anything like that, I might be able to help just putting that out there.

599
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,320
Sincerely yours, Devin L.

600
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,240
Well, maybe we'll have to have Devin on the show at some point.

601
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Ask a developer.

602
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
That might be kind of fun.

603
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
That'd be cool.

604
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,200
But that's kind of neat to know that people on the inside are listening to the program,

605
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,600
and that always makes us feel pretty good, you know.

606
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,760
And certainly we were talking about the guy that worked for the Japanese developer.

607
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,680
He actually was sending me some pictures from Japan.

608
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,000
I actually have to show you.

609
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,960
He sent me some pictures from a pinball arcade in Japan, so I have to show you.

610
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Nice.

611
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
So, kind of cool.

612
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,920
So thank you to the developers that listen to this show, just like any other listener.

613
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
We really appreciate your support.

614
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,240
Well, we got one from the Rob D. Yes.

615
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,520
I was listening to last week's show on the way home from work yesterday, and yes, my

616
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,880
end quiz will label you as super spastic if you suck in that game.

617
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm always amused when an issue with this word comes up, because it shows a giant cultural

618
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,240
divide between the USA and the UK that no one is really aware of.

619
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,120
For whatever reason, the word spaz is highly offensive in the UK, even to the point of

620
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,120
the Spastic Society, a nonprofit organization to aid those with cerebral palsy, changing

621
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,840
its name to SCOPE.

622
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,240
In the US, the surfer lingo of the SoCal area made the word spaz a common insult among youth

623
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
to this date.

624
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,280
A few years ago, Tiger Woods got in huge trouble with his UK fans when he said that he had

625
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,240
played the best I've played for years, and as soon as I got on the green, I was a spaz

626
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,960
during last year's Masters.

627
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,920
Of course, Americans had no idea what the problem was.

628
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,360
Merriam-Webster doesn't even mention cerebral palsy and its definition of the word spaz.

629
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,080
A little side note, whenever I hear spastic, I think of spastic, colon.

630
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,560
Anyway, back to the email.

631
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,600
Although not the most popular, by far the worst and funniest documented case that's

632
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,300
happening is when an American wheelchair manufacturer decided to export one of their products to

633
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,600
Great Britain for sale there.

634
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,000
Unfortunately, the name of this product was called, I kid you not, the spaz with two Z's.

635
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,520
You can imagine how well that went over.

636
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,480
On one hand, I feel sort of bad for the wheelchair company, but the name was cool in the first

637
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
place.

638
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Isn't that kind of like selling a walker and calling it gimpy or marketing head gear for

639
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,680
children with really bad teeth as the most unpopular kid in school brand?

640
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,560
Anyway, I guess the closest analogy I can make is if some Asian company wanted to make

641
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,360
a humorous shirt that said, I'm chicken on the front and accidentally, instead of using

642
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:17,500
the word cock instead of chicken, not realizing how offensive it is.

643
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,500
Great show.

644
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,040
I keep up and keep up the good work.

645
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,880
Maybe you'll actually get to 500 episodes like I accidentally said you already had on

646
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,880
your five-year show.

647
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Rob D.

648
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,640
You know, I find the term scope offensive because it makes me think of mouthwash, which

649
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,100
in turn makes me think of the dentist and I find dentist to be highly offensive because

650
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,480
of what they charge me when I go in there to have my teeth cleaned.

651
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,640
So I find that term to be offensive.

652
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,160
So obviously I'm just messing around, but you know, we learned, we learned a lot about

653
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,600
some of those cultural word differences last week.

654
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,200
You know, I had no idea that that was an offensive term over there, but you know, it's just a

655
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,640
part of the world we live in and all those funny little cultural differences.

656
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,880
So more stuff, more stuff.

657
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:06,240
Oscar once again, thank you, um, and yeah, Rob, you were drunk, quit denying your past.

658
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,320
I do this time.

659
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
I'm just going to read.

660
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
I swear.

661
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
I wasn't drunk.

662
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,720
I think that's what anybody thinks.

663
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,000
Thanks a lot for introducing me to the song anniversary from powder, powder, paradise

664
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,120
with a question mark.

665
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,440
I've been listening to it every day, multiple times a day, bolded ever since.

666
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
Yeah.

667
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Can you tell that I love it?

668
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
So yay for Rob.

669
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Rob is cool.

670
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Rob fan mail for the wind.

671
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
Yay.

672
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,760
I want to get Loki or Jamie out.

673
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
So you all kick ass.

674
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Smiley face.

675
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
I'm boo.

676
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
I want to be by myself.

677
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,200
Rob, your beloved listener, Oscar PS supernova location test back on.

678
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,960
Maybe during the time it was canceled, they made the game better.

679
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Thoughts.

680
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
EMUs maybe.

681
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,240
Uh, wasn't there some news on the whole supernova testing this week?

682
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,360
Like it's back on now.

683
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:55,320
In fact, I think it was posted to our own site, but that was the wonderful, the wonderful

684
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,920
dark Tetsuya actually stays on top of a lot of that stuff.

685
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Apparently.

686
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Yeah.

687
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,520
The supernova two test is back on again for July 12th, 2007.

688
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,840
That's funny because that would be right around the same time as E3, but yeah, that's what

689
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,760
is floating around the internet apparently.

690
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,320
All right.

691
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,480
So can I read more email please?

692
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Of course.

693
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Thank you sir.

694
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
May I have another?

695
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,800
Hi, Orange Launch Radio.

696
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,960
This is a quick email from Maury.

697
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,560
Um, unfortunately for the past two weeks, my computer has been relatively out of commission,

698
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,440
so I wasn't able to send along this message any sooner.

699
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,000
Excuses, excuses.

700
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,520
But congrats on five years and two weeks and two weeks of being on the air, uh, five years

701
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
and two weeks as of today.

702
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Yeah.

703
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,880
I've listened to your show for about a year and a half now and since the last few episodes

704
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,920
of the original OLR to go edition of the podcast, you guys are the only show that I can actually

705
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,840
sit down and listen to all the way without losing interest and short.

706
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
You guys are great.

707
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
Thanks.

708
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,080
And we have a tilde at the end of the things.

709
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Thank you.

710
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,600
But besides that, a few weeks ago I heard someone mention the Sega Pico at one point

711
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
in the episodes.

712
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
I have fond memories of mine, which is currently sitting in a box in my closet.

713
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,600
I actually pulled it out and played around with it after hearing that basically it was

714
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,280
Sega and edutainment.

715
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,200
I did, however, have something vaguely resembling a touch pad, which I forgot about.

716
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,680
Any who, considering the apparently huge amount of systems Dark Sakura owns, by any chance

717
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,180
does she have one?

718
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,040
This has been something I've been wondering about for a while since obviously I have nothing

719
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
better to do.

720
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,420
Um, actually I do not own a Pico.

721
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,280
I came very close to purchasing a Pico at Toys R Us, but we bought a Nomad instead.

722
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,600
I figured Nomad Pico, you know, Nomad high on the pedestal.

723
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:37,240
However, I actually have been looking for a Pico since last week, but bills and I'm

724
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,200
going to Disneyland at the end of the month, so Disneyland greater than Pico.

725
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
Tea cups are better than Pico.

726
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,320
I know and I'm going to freaking ride the hell out because the tea cups go faster at

727
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
night, Rob.

728
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,480
I'm going to get you for going to Disneyland on the weekend, I have to move, which in turn

729
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,440
will probably be no OLR that week, but you know, we're changing studios, so yes.

730
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,640
And in closing, thanks again for your awesomeness and I hope to actually call in on the show

731
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
one day.

732
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,360
Oh, and Sky's game tap promotion made me subscribe to it.

733
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,120
Not quite as big of a purchase as a $60 game, but still, I thought it was worth mentioning

734
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,260
Maury, possibly the second youngest listener at 14.

735
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:17,400
That doesn't help because people think I'm already like up there in bed with them, but

736
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
I swear I'm not.

737
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,560
I just, you know, think they're good.

738
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:28,760
Well, I have to say though, 14 and having, I have to say for a 14 year old, you have

739
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,540
some of the best grammar in an email I have ever seen.

740
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,720
Nothing was misspelled.

741
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,240
You had one typo.

742
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:46,220
I have to say that you are shining example of the educate, of our public education system

743
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,040
working unless you go to private school.

744
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,040
So who's this again?

745
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Maury.

746
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,800
Maury, our listener of the week, everybody give it up.

747
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,500
You are the, you are the emailer of the millennium.

748
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,440
So there you go.

749
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,160
This one is by Schwall 22, I guess.

750
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,780
Hey guys, been a while since I've written and I had to create Loki's misuse of a word

751
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,280
last week.

752
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,280
When referring to a mentally handicapped person, it's a retard example.

753
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,720
That guy is a fucking retard.

754
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:23,520
When referring to music, that's r-i-t-a-r-d, short for retardando, which means to gradually

755
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,880
become slower.

756
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,800
I actually was the one last week that said that retard is used in music, but I knew it

757
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,480
was the misspelling, but you still say it the same way.

758
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,600
Well, that's just two different spellings, same pronunciation.

759
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,200
Oh well, keep up the good work.

760
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,360
I really have been enjoying the show.

761
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,840
Oh, oh, more people should play Overlord.

762
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,840
It's funny as hell.

763
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Buy it so we get a sequel.

764
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
Okay.

765
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
Will do, chief.

766
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,960
Hey, Loki, retard your anger.

767
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,160
Next email, last email is from NintendoManiac64.

768
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,440
Hi, hola, bonjour, guten tag, konnichiwa, et cetera, although actually it's evening

769
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,480
for us, so it would be konbanwa, anyway.

770
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,800
Oh my god, picky lady.

771
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
This is me, Rob.

772
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
I'm gonna go get a water.

773
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,080
Oh, whatever.

774
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,680
This question is pretty much unrelated to OLR, but I may need the input by a largest

775
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,760
group of people, aka the chat room, and not be completely ignored due to the uber speed

776
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,520
that the comments travel at in the said chat room.

777
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,680
Anyway, I'm finally going to be in an M3 perfect, which is the slot two version to replace my

778
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,200
broken supercard CF, which had a connector pin.

779
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,400
This has nothing to do with the, well, you said it had nothing to do with the show.

780
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,720
Okay chat room, I'm just gonna read the question, okay.

781
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,680
It said, to replace my broken supercard CF, which had a connector pin and the CF slot

782
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
break off.

783
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,320
Yes, I tried to solder it back, and it still doesn't work.

784
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,160
My question is, if you or the chat room know if there are any mini or micro SD cards that

785
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:58,480
are four gigabyte but not SDHC, since the M3 perfect isn't compatible with SDHC.

786
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,880
I'm still not sure if I'm gonna get a two gig or a four gig SD card, but if there are

787
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:08,880
any four gigabyte mini or micro non-SDHC cards, my problem is solved right there.

788
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,720
And if anyone yells in the chat room and get an R4 or something, he needs 32 megabyte of

789
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
extra RAM.

790
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
Okay, whatever.

791
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
This has nothing to do with the show.

792
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,140
I'm not gonna read your answer.

793
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,320
Email people, okay.

794
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,480
Your answer, your question fails.

795
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,000
And we have an email from Sauce.

796
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,320
This says, dear Rob, there are four lights.

797
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,720
Love Tiara.

798
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,720
Yes.

799
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,640
There are four lights, but only three show.

800
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,920
I can't wait to play Rob's Voice the Game 2, Iraqi Suicide Babies.

801
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,520
I'm sorry, I left the room when I heard Nintendo Maniac 64 send an email, but then I heard

802
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
my name.

803
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,520
Just kidding, hearts.

804
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,520
What's that?

805
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,520
This email's from Sauce.

806
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
Dear Rob, there are four.

807
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,080
Yes, but when the system breaks, there's only three that come on.

808
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,800
But, but, but, but.

809
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,800
What's it say?

810
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
P.S.

811
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,400
I can't wait to play Rob's Voice the Game 2, Iraqi Suicide Babies.

812
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,720
Because four blinking lights means that your AVC is unplugged.

813
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,760
Best email ever, except for the 14-year-old that can spell shit.

814
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,760
All right, close the mailbag.

815
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,080
We're way over time.

816
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,360
Mailbag is belated.

817
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,800
All right, if you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelaundrado.com, and maybe

818
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Jamie will make fun of you on air next.

819
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,160
Or compliment your grammar.

820
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,440
I would actually like to see, we should have a grammar contest.

821
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,880
Let's see if there's some 13 and 12-year-olds that want to send in some emails and try to

822
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
one-up Maury.

823
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Wouldn't that be exciting?

824
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,880
Awesome.

825
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:40,080
So, anyways, I guess the ongoing quest to get Mother 3 translated is going pretty well.

826
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:46,960
Now two teams have kind of joined forces on the project, and I don't know.

827
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,600
No word on yet when it's going to be done, but, well, actually, no, I guess there was

828
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
a small update.

829
00:44:53,600 --> 00:45:02,240
They said that they're shooting for a release this year, so, awesome, I guess?

830
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,240
I don't know.

831
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,520
Not much a fan of Mother 3, but, great.

832
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,740
I fucking love Earthbound.

833
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,020
Why doesn't Nintendo, I don't know, translate the game themselves?

834
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:19,040
Because they're dumbasses, because they would rather redo Pit Cross and release it on the

835
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,040
DS.

836
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,840
There's so much Nintendo hate tonight.

837
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,880
I apologize to the Nintendo fans, but I don't.

838
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,880
It's all right.

839
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,280
Next week will be Nintendo love.

840
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,280
That's true.

841
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,080
I know there's a lot of love for this this week.

842
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:38,120
Rock Band had some footage hit the internet, and a lot of folks were very, very happy about

843
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,120
this.

844
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,680
I'm going to play this in studio here, because I'm sure not everybody has seen it.

845
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,680
Oh, never mind, I can't.

846
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,960
It got taken off YouTube.

847
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,520
But basically, okay, imagine Guitar Hero side by side three times, then Karaoke Revolution

848
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,520
on top.

849
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,040
That's kind of what Rock Band looked like, and the video I guess was leaked to the internet,

850
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,320
so then Harmonics kind of had to step in and put something a little more legit out there

851
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,720
and kind of confessed to what was going on, and mentioned that the song that you heard

852
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,920
in there, Welcome to the Jungle, was just a demo song and may not actually be in the

853
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
final version of the game.

854
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,260
But that was so awesome.

855
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,480
It looked like a shitload of fun.

856
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,480
Did you guys see the clip?

857
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,480
Oh my God, yes.

858
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,000
Yeah, it looks good.

859
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,080
The only negative complaint I've heard on it is that maybe the karaoke part is too small,

860
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,840
which could be very hard to see on a regular TV.

861
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,280
I don't know about that, but it looked pretty good.

862
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,680
But doesn't everybody have a widescreen HDTV these days, huh?

863
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,160
It's not so much that, but shouldn't everyone...

864
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,760
Sony thinks so.

865
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,840
Shouldn't everyone know the lyrics to Welcome to the Jungle?

866
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,460
I mean, shouldn't you know this song by heart?

867
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,460
I don't know the lyrics.

868
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,160
Welcome to the Jungle!

869
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,900
Well yeah, I know parts of it.

870
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,900
I don't know...

871
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

872
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,320
See, I could just make it up.

873
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,320
I don't need the...

874
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,720
You know, there's other words in there too, but who cares?

875
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,040
Will this game let you cheat like Karaoke Revolution does?

876
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,240
No, they supposedly have a thing that detects the phonics in your voice, so that you're

877
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,200
not going to be able to go, you know, like, what was it?

878
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,640
It's the end of the world as we know it, where it's like, uh, you know, the whole song.

879
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,640
That's how I sing It's the End of the World as we know it in Karaoke Revolution.

880
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,640
Have you ever played any of the Japanese versions of Karaoke Revolution?

881
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,760
I have not.

882
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,000
They actually make sure that you are pronouncing everything right.

883
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Wow.

884
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,280
They're very, very specific.

885
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,280
Let's see.

886
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,920
Rob D says that was the greatest rendition of Welcome to the Jungle ever.

887
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,920
Why they...

888
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,240
See why they want Sky's voice in the game?

889
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,520
Ego plus five right there.

890
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,600
Plus four strength, plus four stamina, plus four ego.

891
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,680
Act Deft says, is telling the Rob D, Harmonic says it won't be that expensive.

892
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,880
Oh, because the Rob D said Rock Band equals expensive game I won't be buying.

893
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,880
So I don't know.

894
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,240
It could be fun though.

895
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,040
Jamie will buy it because she loves those types of games.

896
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:57,080
Actually, I will probably get suckered into buying it like I did with Guitar Hero 2 and

897
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,640
then I won't play it again.

898
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,640
Gonna be good times.

899
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,960
I will not do the Karaoke portion of the game though.

900
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,760
I think I might.

901
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,760
Please.

902
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
No.

903
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,440
One time on the show do the Karaoke.

904
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,440
Never.

905
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,440
Please.

906
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
Can't you do Welcome to the Jungle?

907
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,160
No, but you just did such a wonderful rendition.

908
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
Oh, shut up.

909
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,160
I hate you.

910
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,080
Well, even though I hate Loki right now, I still love Jamie for now.

911
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,480
So I will allow her a chance to share with you all her website of the week because she

912
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
was out last week.

913
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,080
So she's got to make it extra good this week.

914
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,080
Dark Sakura.

915
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,080
I was dead sore last week.

916
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,440
Where should the kids be pointing their websites, browsers this week?

917
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:47,400
The website of the week is newsescue.com because it's Kevin Smith and I don't need to tell

918
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,400
you anything else.

919
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,680
It's freaking Kevin Smith.

920
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,920
So it's like news for View Askew, which is Kevin Smith's production company.

921
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,720
Yes, it's Kevin Smith.

922
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,720
So just go.

923
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,880
And there's a link on there for drinking games too for each of the movies.

924
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,400
Oh, that's fun.

925
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,680
I think that is really awesome.

926
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,680
Good times.

927
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,680
Newsescue.com.

928
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,300
There is a View Askew website and one of the others is moviepoopshoot.com.

929
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,040
One thing I always liked about Kevin Smith, from what I remember, because I was reading

930
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,720
up on Dogma a lot because I was really interested in that movie when it first came out and I

931
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,680
liked the movie a lot, I seem to remember that Kevin Smith will actually post on his

932
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,680
forums and stuff.

933
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:33,080
He's actually got a blog update too called My Boring Ass Life.

934
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,320
The internet did forgive him for Jersey Girl though, right?

935
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,320
I think so.

936
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,320
I think it's fair to say.

937
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,320
I never did see Clerks too though.

938
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
I should hang my head in shame.

939
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,400
I need to go rent it.

940
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,480
I do need to see it.

941
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,560
How did I miss it?

942
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,280
I just don't watch any movies anymore.

943
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,280
It's sad.

944
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,760
And Kevin Smith has a MySpace too.

945
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
Does he?

946
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
I should add him.

947
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,760
I love The Evening With Kevin Smith.

948
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,760
That's one of my favorite DVDs ever.

949
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,760
All right.

950
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,760
Newsescue.com.

951
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,080
Check it out when you're taking a break from the games.

952
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,080
Has Kevin Smith admitted he plays video games?

953
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,080
I would imagine he does.

954
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,080
He seems like a big nerd.

955
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
I don't think so.

956
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,640
Well, how come there hasn't been a Jay and Silent Bob video game?

957
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,440
That's what I want to know.

958
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,440
Maybe someday.

959
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
Good question.

960
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:18,960
Anywho, there's some interesting news coming from Australia.

961
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:26,880
Apparently a sort of affair between a 31-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy went awry and

962
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,300
she was arrested for kidnapping charges.

963
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:38,280
The whole thing took place over World of Warcraft where apparently the 31-year-old, I'm just

964
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,760
going to assume that she was a MILF, because she's, well, no, of course not.

965
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,480
Anyways, then again, if she's hitting on 17-year-old boys, who knows?

966
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,480
I know.

967
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,480
MILF?

968
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,600
Does that mean like mom is large and fat?

969
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,600
Is that MILF?

970
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:06,540
Anyways, so apparently she was creating this deep and trusting relationship with her barely

971
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,180
legal boyfriend for more than a year.

972
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,760
How do you form a deep and trusting relationship on World of Warcraft?

973
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:20,440
I will give you this four-strength, four-stamp leather belt if you will eat my pussy.

974
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
I don't know.

975
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,240
How do you do that?

976
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,240
Or I'll give you a Leeroy Jenkins.

977
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,320
Is that a new sexual term?

978
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,640
Is that what these two say during, oh, I shouldn't even say that.

979
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,640
I shouldn't use that, that's bad.

980
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,640
Never mind.

981
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:46,680
But anyways, apparently she was going to meet the boy and they were going, because she lived

982
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,640
in Australia, but she was going to meet him, I guess he lived out of country, and basically

983
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,920
take him with her and they were going to fly to Australia and he was going to live with

984
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,920
her.

985
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,680
Apparently, the parents found out about it and had her arrested.

986
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,760
Wait, so she was Australian?

987
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,760
Yeah.

988
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,760
Oh, wow.

989
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:12,160
What's wrong with you guys in Australia and your MILFs and, no, I'm just kidding, obviously

990
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,080
it's one bad apple ruining the barrel.

991
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:20,600
I'm sure the media hasn't gone crazy with this story about how World of Warcraft is

992
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:26,400
predator for children and blah, blah, blah, Dateline NBC special about the scary MILFs

993
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,360
on Warcraft reaching out, buying plane tickets for 17-year-old boys.

994
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:38,600
The boy lived in North Carolina, so I would assume that the age of consent, of course,

995
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,040
here is usually over 18.

996
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,040
That's a long plane ride.

997
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,360
He'll probably be 18 by the time he gets to Australia, so what's so wrong with that?

998
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,640
The time zone changes and the Dateline, you know?

999
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,640
Exactly.

1000
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,640
He's 18.

1001
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,640
Exactly.

1002
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,840
All right, well we are just about done with all these stories for tonight and we are going

1003
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,640
to be opening up the Skype line for you guys to call in and interact with our program.

1004
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,200
If you want to give us a call, you can call us on Skype.

1005
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,200
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio or you can call us on our 800 number or I should say

1006
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,920
877 number.

1007
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1008
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,920
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1009
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:23,400
We will take your calls very soon, however, first we have another score to settle and

1010
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,480
that's tonight's List List.

1011
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,400
We need to know who won tonight's List List.

1012
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,720
The topic tonight, of course, most random things we'd like to see at this year's E3.

1013
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,000
We have winners and let's reveal them now.

1014
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,640
Number three, the number three thing our chat room would like to mostly happen to E3 this

1015
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,800
year, Halo 3 gets delayed or canceled.

1016
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,460
A lot of bitterness towards Halo 3 in our chat room.

1017
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,460
The number two thing, according to the OrangeLoungeRadio listeners and therefore the definitive

1018
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:57,520
number two thing that must happen at E3 this year, Konami announces Sky's Voice the Game.

1019
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,600
The number two thing that happens this year and the number one thing that the folks would

1020
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,080
like to see happen at E3 this year, so this must happen, this is the number one demand

1021
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,080
of the people.

1022
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,840
This is the people saying this must happen.

1023
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,040
Pyramid Head must show up and kill everyone for E4.

1024
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:23,200
There you have it, tonight's definitive List of the needs of E3 2007.

1025
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:29,480
All right, let's open up the Skype line and take some calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1026
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,440
Did they do a good job tonight, you think?

1027
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,160
I think they did a good one, I don't know.

1028
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,400
I think they came up with a good list, I don't know what you guys think.

1029
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,080
All right, let's go to the phones.

1030
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,040
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1031
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Ravenstaufen.

1032
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,760
Oh, surprise, surprise, how did you get through Ravenstaufen?

1033
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,200
My new Mac, that's why.

1034
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,800
Do you have us on speed dial?

1035
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,800
Yes.

1036
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,720
All right, well it worked.

1037
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,280
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

1038
00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:00,320
Well, the E3's coming up and I know everyone's really excited and the thing about it is it's

1039
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,320
very small.

1040
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,880
Does it feel weird to you that it's now instead of it was in May?

1041
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,240
To me, it was around my birthday and I was like, yeah, E3's coming up and I'm like, now

1042
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,080
it's like E3's up?

1043
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,160
Well yeah, but at the same time as we were kind of saying in part A, just because it's

1044
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,840
a smaller show doesn't mean the companies have any less or more to gain and there's

1045
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:25,640
going to be press there that's just as, you know, as honest as there were in years past.

1046
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,800
I think enough people have managed to get in even though it's supposed to be a lockdown

1047
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,000
show or whatever.

1048
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,720
So I don't really see what's exactly changed except for the fact that, you know, little

1049
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:41,280
podcasters like us and little press and foreign press and GameStop employees don't get in

1050
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,680
and Best Buy employees and all that crap.

1051
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,240
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1052
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,240
You know, we're still going to get the press conferences like we normally do.

1053
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:54,000
So I don't see much of a change like you said, you know, we're still going to see it.

1054
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,680
Yeah, I don't know.

1055
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,960
I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens as E3 goes on.

1056
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,640
It's going to be hard to say, you know, and it's, and you could say that, you know, people,

1057
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,160
there's not as many people to tear apart the demos or base their opinion of games right

1058
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,760
off the demos, but you're seeing the whole Xbox Live and PlayStation 3 become more and

1059
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,080
more and more.

1060
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,080
You know what I mean?

1061
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,840
Like you can download those on their own live or PlayStation Network services so you can

1062
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,200
get a lot of those demos actually.

1063
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,400
I'm really excited for actually bringing it home.

1064
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,160
And that's going to be really interesting because they did an okay job with it last

1065
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,160
year.

1066
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,160
But for the people like me saying home, I lost planets on Xbox Live.

1067
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:38,440
I was at E3 last year and I still enjoyed the Xbox Live, you know, watching their videos

1068
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,520
from the show floor because I kind of actually liked seeing some of the boosts I went to

1069
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,840
at E3 was kind of fun.

1070
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,840
So I don't know.

1071
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,160
Maybe I'm just weird like that.

1072
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,880
Yeah, I'll be home too.

1073
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,400
But Scott got that thing on his head.

1074
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,280
Yeah, I heard about that over at Allgame.

1075
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,480
What the hell is that?

1076
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,040
He got he bought a webcam for his head.

1077
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,100
He's going to E3.

1078
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:00,720
See with stuff like that, you're not going to keep people out of E3.

1079
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,720
Where there is information, there will be people seeking it out.

1080
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,040
One more thing, Ravenstauven?

1081
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,640
Yeah, one more thing.

1082
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,440
You know, I just bought this Mac and no, I'm not using games because there's no such thing

1083
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,920
as games on a Mac.

1084
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,700
So what did you buy the Mac for, angry one?

1085
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,040
I bought it because of change.

1086
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,840
And no, Loki, don't tell me.

1087
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,640
Don't pick up that pitchfork.

1088
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,640
He'll be OK.

1089
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,640
No, no, no.

1090
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,640
I'm not switching.

1091
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,640
No.

1092
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,640
All right.

1093
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,640
All right.

1094
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,640
Thanks for the call, Ravenstauven.

1095
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,640
Take care, buddy.

1096
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,640
You too.

1097
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,640
Bye.

1098
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,640
Bye bye.

1099
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,640
All right.

1100
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,960
By the way, Maury, our emailer of the week, sent me a private message in chat.

1101
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,080
Maury says, just for clarification, I'm in public school.

1102
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:44,840
Ah, well then, wherever you are, congrats to your public school system.

1103
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:49,080
And your English teacher's mad props for me.

1104
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,020
And mad props to you for paying attention.

1105
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,460
I want to show you this on air real quick because there's not a lot of calls coming

1106
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,460
in right now.

1107
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,460
So we want more calls.

1108
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,460
But look at this.

1109
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,460
Somebody just sent me the link for this in chat.

1110
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,520
This is actually what they're doing at E3.

1111
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,040
And you can see that Scott is on.

1112
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,040
I can see your arm.

1113
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,040
I'm sorry.

1114
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,360
You can see Scott is on live right now playing Texas Hold'em.

1115
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,040
Although I think he must have it hooked into his TV or something.

1116
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,760
He's filing a complaint against somebody right now on Xbox Live.

1117
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,320
Isn't that weird?

1118
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,320
That's pretty cool.

1119
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,440
It's like reality TV gone crazy.

1120
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,320
SSJ100Matt says link or I shut the fuck up.

1121
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:29,320
My god, I'd love to do this with my cat while I'm, you know, waiting for the day.

1122
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,800
Normally at work, you know, the cat stays in the bedroom.

1123
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,360
I should put a camera up on the wall or something.

1124
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,520
I tried to say hi from OLR in the chat room, but it wouldn't let me because I didn't have

1125
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,520
a nickname.

1126
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,520
Forget it.

1127
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,600
Somebody else, if you're watching that whole thing, tell them we just played that live

1128
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,600
on air.

1129
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,600
All right.

1130
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,600
Let's go take some more calls.

1131
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,600
Hello.

1132
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,840
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1133
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
Who's this?

1134
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,840
It's Legend of Zaku.

1135
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1136
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,840
What's on your mind?

1137
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,240
Nah, just trying to get through.

1138
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
That's all.

1139
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,240
Yeah.

1140
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,240
I just came back from anime next.

1141
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,040
How was anime next?

1142
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,040
It was all right, though.

1143
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:08,920
I mean, I know I was rooming with Ramen, so it was even better.

1144
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,920
Yeah.

1145
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,080
Since I think he's not here right now, he's supposed to be calling you to give you the

1146
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,080
scoop on everything else.

1147
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,080
Actually, wait.

1148
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,080
Hold on.

1149
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,080
Hold on.

1150
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,080
Hello?

1151
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,080
Hey, what's up?

1152
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,760
Oh, I put Zaku on hold because I saw you calling in on the back line.

1153
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,760
Can I conference?

1154
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,760
How do I conference?

1155
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,760
Shit.

1156
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,760
Shut up, Ram.

1157
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,760
Hold on.

1158
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,760
Let me see.

1159
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,760
This might put you on hold.

1160
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,760
Cool.

1161
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
Zaku, you still there?

1162
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,760
Yeah.

1163
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,760
Okay.

1164
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
Ramen's actually on the other line.

1165
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,760
We just had to put him on hold.

1166
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,760
God damn it.

1167
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,760
How do we conference?

1168
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,760
Oh, wait.

1169
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,320
There's a button that says conference.

1170
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:47,360
Showing current call to another call.

1171
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,520
This is live radio, boys and girls.

1172
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
Okay.

1173
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,520
Hello?

1174
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,520
Yeah.

1175
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,520
No.

1176
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,360
I'm conferencing with you.

1177
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,360
Hold on.

1178
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,360
We're going to call you right back.

1179
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,360
All right.

1180
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,360
Live radio, boys and girls.

1181
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,360
Hi.

1182
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,360
You still there, Ramen?

1183
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,360
Hello?

1184
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,160
I fucked it all up.

1185
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,160
Ramen!

1186
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,160
Ramen!

1187
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,160
Ramen!

1188
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,160
Ramen!

1189
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,160
Ramen!

1190
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:20,000
Now I just lost our entire anime next report.

1191
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Let's just call Zaku back.

1192
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Hi.

1193
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,840
All right.

1194
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,840
It didn't work.

1195
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,840
So whatever.

1196
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,520
Just give us your report and then we'll hold Ramen calls back.

1197
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,520
What's on your mind?

1198
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,520
Yeah.

1199
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:35,640
Basically, between an agreement between me and him, I'm covering the gaming aspect of

1200
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,640
it.

1201
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,600
So far, their gaming room.

1202
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,480
I mean, it has the usual stuff, Halo, Dirt Strike.

1203
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:50,720
They added stuff like Guitar Hero and the inevitable 2DX setup, which was mediocre at

1204
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,720
best.

1205
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,720
Yeah, but that's about it.

1206
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,400
They had tournaments on certain games, like Smash Brothers.

1207
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,120
Was there any new stuff in the game room, stuff you hadn't seen before?

1208
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,720
Only the Guitar Hero, from what I heard, since they replaced the DDR setup with that.

1209
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,640
They used the 360 version.

1210
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,640
Oh, interesting.

1211
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,640
Okay.

1212
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,840
And so they held tournaments on that and Gears of War.

1213
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:21,200
But besides that, they were also selling a lot of imports in the dealer's room within

1214
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,200
the convention hall.

1215
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,680
So I managed to snag a copy of Fifth Style for like 40 bucks.

1216
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,680
Very cool.

1217
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,760
What about any gaming paraphernalia, for lack of a better word, like this ball-fire figure

1218
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,160
came from something like that?

1219
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,200
Yeah, they were all in the dealer room.

1220
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,400
There was a lot of cosplayers, you know, dressing up as Mario and other video game characters.

1221
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,600
But yeah, most of the good merchandise.

1222
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,760
I bet you didn't see someone dressed up as a Wii remote.

1223
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,400
Oh, actually, close.

1224
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,080
An actual Wii, with the other person holding the Wii mode behind them.

1225
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,440
Jonas, I think someone stole your idea.

1226
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,680
So wait, they cosplayed as an actual Wii system without the Wii remote?

1227
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,680
Yes.

1228
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,040
No, an actual Wii system, and then this other person was holding the Wii mode for him.

1229
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,000
I heard rumors that that showed up in SAC Anime in January.

1230
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,800
If that is the case, I might see him on SAC Anime in July.

1231
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,800
Which is quite exciting.

1232
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,480
You're talking about an East Coast thing.

1233
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,480
I don't know.

1234
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,280
Who the hell would come to SAC for an anime convention if you don't live here, or the

1235
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,280
Bay Area, maybe.

1236
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,360
Yeah, you're talking about something that happened in Jersey, not Sacramento.

1237
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,640
All right, well, all right, look.

1238
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,480
Now stop the whole bi-coastal thing.

1239
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,280
Zaku, anything else you want to share on the game room?

1240
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,880
That's pretty much about it.

1241
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,120
The only thing I can say that really pissed me off was just the fact that it was too small

1242
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,640
and they were just controlling crowds.

1243
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,640
Basically it had a forum.

1244
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,120
It was basically almost like a night club where they just had people just waiting there

1245
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:53,440
in line, you know, since the game room was packed most of the time anyways.

1246
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,440
So yeah.

1247
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:00,320
All right, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can go to Rama and get his

1248
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,200
side of the story on what's going on.

1249
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,560
Anything else you want to say about the con real quick?

1250
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,560
It was all right.

1251
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,880
I mean, it's my first con, so I really don't have that much to say.

1252
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,120
All I need to know is that I need to go to more conventions.

1253
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,760
But you want to go to more cons now?

1254
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,440
Yeah, I guess I got a plan for next year.

1255
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,440
Oh, it's a con.

1256
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,440
Well, I guess that's a good sign.

1257
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,440
All right, who knows?

1258
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,440
I may come in.

1259
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,720
I should have planned earlier.

1260
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,120
I'm hoping next year I'll be able to afford an East Coast con, so we'll see.

1261
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,120
All right.

1262
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,120
All right, later, Zaku.

1263
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,120
All right, later.

1264
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,200
And of course, now that I'm finished with Zaku, Rama is nowhere to be seen.

1265
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,360
I should be able to call him back, though.

1266
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,800
He's somewhere in the history, right?

1267
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,120
Damn it.

1268
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,940
Live radio, boys and girls.

1269
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,320
I guess not.

1270
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,560
We'll take another call real quick.

1271
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1272
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,400
Who's this?

1273
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,400
Hey, guys.

1274
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,400
This is Footy Monster from Argentina.

1275
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,760
Hey, Footy Monster.

1276
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,760
What's on your mind?

1277
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,560
We're waiting for Rama to call back, but he never did, so we're taking another call in

1278
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,560
the meantime.

1279
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,560
So what's on your mind?

1280
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,320
All right, then I'll make it fat just in case he calls back.

1281
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,320
It's all good.

1282
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,320
Take your time.

1283
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,320
I'll let you know if we see him.

1284
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,640
All right, then.

1285
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,800
Just two things I wanted to point out.

1286
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,740
One thing is that, well, picked up, quote unquote, kind of illegally, Nervous Breakdown

1287
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:15,500
for DS, which is an Arkanoid Breakout clone.

1288
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,500
That sounds like fun.

1289
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,400
And it is really good.

1290
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,440
It's a game you wouldn't pay two cents for, but it's actually really, really good.

1291
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:29,920
It starts off as a normal Breakout game, but really quick, it begins to have different

1292
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,160
skins and different gimmicks to the game.

1293
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:37,060
Instead of having one paddle, you have one on the bottom screen and one on the top screen,

1294
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:41,480
and you've got to make sure that you don't flumb with the ball in the middle.

1295
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,800
You might have a ball that starts going faster and faster, which is second, or you might

1296
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:49,080
need to blow into the screen to have the ball go up a little bit all the time instead of

1297
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:53,160
keep going down, because sometimes you're on a scrolling screen, and you're always going

1298
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,160
up.

1299
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,360
It's like you die and stuff like that.

1300
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,120
It's really weird, but it's actually pretty fun.

1301
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,440
How do you control that with the stylus?

1302
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,440
All with the stylus.

1303
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,440
There's no buttons whatsoever.

1304
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,400
Do you drag the paddle around?

1305
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,560
Yeah, you drag the paddle around.

1306
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,480
Sometimes you've got to drag just left and right.

1307
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,040
Sometimes you can drag across the whole screen, so you can actually move it up and down, too.

1308
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:16,040
And there's this level where you actually have to draw your own paddle, so you can draw

1309
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,560
it in any shape you want.

1310
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,880
That sounds pretty cool.

1311
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:20,880
I know.

1312
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,680
There's a team of 10 people that made it, and it's like 20 bucks or something like that,

1313
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:29,840
so I'm definitely going to try to pick it up next week when I go to Toronto.

1314
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,720
But yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know, I know there are some people that like that

1315
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:39,400
kind of game on All Art, and maybe you, Sky, because you like puzzle games, but that's

1316
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,920
a pretty good game, so you might want to try it out.

1317
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,920
Absolutely.

1318
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,040
I want this game, because I was a big Arkanoid fan.

1319
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:51,000
Actually, there's a little part where you're basically controlling a ship instead of having

1320
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
just a paddle.

1321
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,480
It's a ship that shoots lasers, so you can actually shoot lasers and destroy obstacles

1322
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,880
on the screen and stuff like that while you're bouncing the ball around.

1323
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,880
Do you get to fight dough?

1324
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,760
What was that, sorry?

1325
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,360
Do you get to fight dough?

1326
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,360
Yeah.

1327
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,700
All right.

1328
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,320
Real quickly, before I let you go, anything you're looking forward to at E3 this week?

1329
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,320
Yeah.

1330
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:18,080
Actually, I'm looking forward to everything RPG-related for obvious reasons, and I'm really

1331
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,240
curious to see if Sega is going to announce anything related to Shenmue, like at all,

1332
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,880
even Shenmue Online, anything.

1333
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,680
But it's just hopeful to me that I know it will not happen, but I have to keep wondering

1334
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:32,520
about it, because they robbed me from my Shenmue 3, so hey, you know.

1335
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:37,380
I would say you have about as much chance of seeing Shenmue 3 as you do the public apology

1336
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:38,380
for Sonic.

1337
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,320
Yeah, Shenmue 2 sort of bombed, didn't it?

1338
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:46,680
The first one was really good, especially playing Space Harrier.

1339
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,680
That was my first Shenmue.

1340
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,580
We probably shouldn't be getting to this, because I'm such a big fanboy that I could

1341
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:55,360
talk for hours about the game, so just saying that.

1342
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,600
One last thing, I think next weekend there's going to be a fighting game tournament in

1343
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:04,960
Toronto in York University, so if you are interested, I think it's like five bucks or

1344
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,960
ten bucks to get in.

1345
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,920
It's like three days, and it's going to be crazy full of people, so I'm going to try

1346
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,040
to, since I might fly, arrive on Saturday, I'm going to try to go straight there.

1347
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,640
Well, give us a call and let us know how it goes.

1348
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:21,040
If I actually want to do anything, I'll call in, you know, next Sunday.

1349
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,040
Alright, sounds good.

1350
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,360
Thanks so much for the call, Footy Monster.

1351
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,360
Take care.

1352
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,360
Okay, you guys too.

1353
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,360
Alright, bye-bye.

1354
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,360
Bye.

1355
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,880
Alright, I think we have Rama calling back now.

1356
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,040
Hi, you're on Orange Onions Radio, who's this?

1357
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,200
Hello, you're on Orange Onions Radio, who's this?

1358
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,200
It's Harvey.

1359
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,580
Apparently the volume went away.

1360
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,560
If you can hear me, we can't hear you.

1361
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,160
Something happened to your phone.

1362
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,880
That totally is Rama trying to call us back, too.

1363
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,880
Son of a gun.

1364
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,560
Ron, Ron.

1365
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,560
I don't know what's wrong.

1366
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,200
I wanted to hear the report, too, from a vet.

1367
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
Oh my God.

1368
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:03,440
SSG100, Matt, you're suddenly my hero for saying Admiral Ackbar's cereal is greater

1369
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,700
than Night Trap 2.

1370
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:11,840
We watched that, Rob, before you showed up at the 4th of July party.

1371
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,400
We watched the Star Wars robot chicken.

1372
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,160
I think you guys were watching some of that.

1373
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,160
No, we were watching My Name is Earl when you were over.

1374
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,540
That show was great.

1375
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:24,800
You had a great 4th of July party, except for my killer headache, but that wasn't your

1376
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,800
party's fault.

1377
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,800
You want to know what, Rob?

1378
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,800
What?

1379
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,160
I had a headache the entire time myself, and I ended up having to sleep with an ice pack

1380
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,160
on my head.

1381
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,240
Oh, that's horrible.

1382
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,320
I was in migraine hell the entire time.

1383
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,080
The sad thing is that I live there, so I couldn't leave.

1384
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,000
Thankfully, my boyfriend's really good friend is a physician's assistant, so we always call

1385
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,360
him for drug advice, like, what should I be taking, because I have a killer headache,

1386
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,360
and it worked.

1387
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,120
All right, I don't see Rama calling back, so at least we'll go to another call.

1388
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,120
Hi, you're on Orange Honors Radio.

1389
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,120
Who's this?

1390
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,120
Hey, Rob.

1391
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,480
Able to think from the forum, so you can mute my thing.

1392
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,480
Hello.

1393
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,480
Able to think.

1394
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,880
Are you a first-time caller?

1395
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,560
Yeah, I am.

1396
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,840
Well, welcome to the show.

1397
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,840
What's on your mind?

1398
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,640
Thanks for calling.

1399
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:19,880
That psycho lady from Australia who decided to try to abduct, well, technically abduct

1400
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,800
the kids from whatever state that was.

1401
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,360
That was kind of gross.

1402
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,080
Yeah, what is up with that?

1403
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,400
What did you want to say about that?

1404
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,820
I mean, does that just not make you feel good in your tummy?

1405
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,000
Does it make you sick?

1406
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,520
It makes me want to go grab a shotgun, and hopefully...

1407
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:43,080
Well, now, wait a minute, careful what you say on an internet radio program.

1408
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,480
You need to be shot with happy lasers.

1409
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,480
Yes, that's right.

1410
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,440
You want to shoot with flowers and rose petals.

1411
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,440
Bunch of flowers.

1412
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:54,320
Seriously, if a lady like that came to my door, I'd probably freak.

1413
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:59,400
Well, but the thing that pisses me off about it is that it gives World of Warcraft a bad

1414
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:04,480
name because nobody stops to think that, oh, this is just some crazy bitch.

1415
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:09,120
But they go, oh, well, they met on World of Warcraft, so obviously all the crazies are

1416
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,320
on World of Warcraft, which is somewhat true.

1417
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,960
There are a lot of crazies on World of Warcraft, but we're not all crazy.

1418
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,680
What's that, buddy?

1419
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:24,440
I think you mean video games in general because that seems to be whatever everybody thinks.

1420
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,660
Whenever anything goes wrong with society, it's all video games' fault.

1421
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,660
That's true.

1422
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,660
That happens.

1423
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:35,480
And our crazy psycho lawyer friend whose name we must not mention.

1424
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,480
That's absolutely right.

1425
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,480
I know.

1426
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,480
It's just, ugh.

1427
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,480
Drives us nuts.

1428
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,440
Well, what are you looking forward to at E3 next week?

1429
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:50,160
Okay, I want to see if Nintendo announces a Wii hard drive.

1430
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,280
A Wii hard drive?

1431
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,400
What the hell would they use it for?

1432
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:01,480
Virtual console games, and if they have an Xbox Live service coming on, then they're

1433
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:10,520
going to need to get it so you can have more space or else you're not going to be able

1434
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,720
to fit all your games on there.

1435
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:17,200
How about they use the SD memory card slot that they have on there and don't seem to

1436
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,200
use for anything?

1437
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:24,000
Yeah, well, that would help too, but still, you have to go buy lots of SD cards, a hard

1438
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,160
drive, or just be a single purchase.

1439
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:32,560
I'm sure they'll use it for all that download content that's available on Wii Connect 24.

1440
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,800
I know my flash drive is teaming with tons and tons and tons and tons of content, so

1441
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,240
much so that I don't get around to playing any of it.

1442
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,600
Well, I mean, who knows?

1443
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,080
The Magic 8-Ball says not bloody likely on that, but who knew that Nintendo would put

1444
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,880
out a two-screen system with a touchscreen?

1445
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:59,280
Oh, and on two.

1446
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,280
I have an FU.

1447
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,160
Is that okay if I F you something?

1448
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,160
Really quick, sure.

1449
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,920
F you to spin markers because they cheat.

1450
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,840
I can't spin my finger.

1451
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,080
So you're giving an FU an oh and on two.

1452
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,120
What's the problem with the spin markers?

1453
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,280
Okay, they cheat.

1454
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,280
It's like a nice lady.

1455
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:24,320
She has to get their sweet spot or else it doesn't work.

1456
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,200
Very well put, my friend.

1457
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,200
Very well put.

1458
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,200
All right, we've got to let you go, though, buddy.

1459
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,560
Thanks so much for the call, but we're going to try and get Rama one more time here, and

1460
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,320
we'll talk to you again, okay?

1461
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,320
See you.

1462
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,920
All right, thanks for the call.

1463
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,920
We like hearing from noobs.

1464
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,000
It's always good to hear from new people.

1465
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Ah, damn it.

1466
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,600
Just as I went to the tab that Rama's call, he dropped.

1467
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,600
Ah.

1468
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,840
Oh, there he is again.

1469
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,560
Let's try to get him.

1470
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,560
One more time.

1471
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,560
This is Rama.

1472
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,560
Who's this?

1473
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,560
This is Rama.

1474
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,560
Can you hear me now?

1475
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,560
Thank God.

1476
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,560
Yes, we can.

1477
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,560
We can hear you.

1478
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,560
What's on your mind, buddy?

1479
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,560
Please.

1480
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,560
This better be good.

1481
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,280
All right, now I'm going with my anime mixed con report, and I'll tell you this right now.

1482
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,240
For a local con, it was pretty much off the walls.

1483
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,240
Really?

1484
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,240
That's a glowing reveal.

1485
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,240
What happened?

1486
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,240
What made this con so freaking great?

1487
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:16,480
Well, one of the main important things about cons is it's just as good as the friends who

1488
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,480
were there.

1489
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:23,240
When I got there, I knew half the people there getting stuff like, hey, how are you and stuff.

1490
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:28,400
The fact that it's like the way that the con is laid out, you have the expo center, like

1491
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,800
six, seven hotels in the area, everybody's just hanging out at the holly in Fort Lorne

1492
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,400
or they're hanging out from the expo center, and you go on the inside, you see a lot of

1493
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,960
video game cosplay, which was really awesome in my book.

1494
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,560
Was there a lot of gaming content at this con?

1495
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:48,000
The way Zachar made it sound, it wasn't too much on the gaming.

1496
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,840
Well I do know this much, it basically got rid of the DDR room and replaced it with Guitar

1497
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,840
Hero.

1498
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,280
Yeah, I guess you've kind of seen that slowly happening in a lot of cons, and pretty soon

1499
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,640
Rock Band, huh?

1500
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,640
Pretty much.

1501
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,400
I would like it as if what anime had choose to have was they actually had an arcade machine

1502
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,800
in the con itself.

1503
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,520
People come up and play it for free, which I thought was pretty cool.

1504
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,640
Hey, Rama, the chat wants to know, are you calling in from a TARDIS?

1505
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:20,800
No, it's called Sprint Network.

1506
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,600
You just sound like you're in a box somewhere, it's kind of funny, that's alright.

1507
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,360
Well, Rama, how about the anime side of things?

1508
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,200
I know you're a big anime fan, how was that represented?

1509
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,200
Was there a lot of stuff to do and see and good guests and stuff?

1510
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,200
Definitely.

1511
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:39,640
I was able to interview a couple of voice actors, Chris Patton and Monica Rial.

1512
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,280
They both worked for ABB and Funimation.

1513
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:47,680
One thing I've noticed with a lot of cons nowadays, it's not about what's going on now,

1514
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,000
but what's very popular in Japan.

1515
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,800
And the biggest thing is always Final Fantasy, which is a gig, but that's starting to kind

1516
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,280
of dwindle down.

1517
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:01,880
Now you see a lot of more stuff that's coming out, I saw a lot of Lucky Star, Cosplay, I

1518
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,280
think some SMA would be still somewhat popular.

1519
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,280
Interesting, huh?

1520
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,280
Very cool.

1521
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,280
Very.

1522
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,280
Anything else?

1523
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,280
Any funny, funny things happen to the con you want to share with us, especially funny

1524
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,280
moments?

1525
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:23,520
Well, I was at the dead dog, which is the staff party, and the Las Vegas rule was put

1526
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,520
in effect.

1527
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,960
So I really can't tell you about that, but I can say this, most of my funny experiences

1528
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,960
is that running into people that I know, and I'm like, do I know you?

1529
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:39,240
Oh, now I know who you are, different costume, different makeup, and it's like, ah, I see.

1530
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,440
Well, what happens at Anime Cons stays at Anime Cons, huh?

1531
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,560
Definitely, especially when you're taking shots with Silco.

1532
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,840
Well, all right, don't have too much fun over there, okay?

1533
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,360
I don't want to be left, I was on my way back when I was trying to call.

1534
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
What?

1535
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,680
I'm sorry?

1536
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,840
I was on my way back from the party when I was trying to call.

1537
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,560
Ah, well, maybe that explains some of the difficulty we had earlier.

1538
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,240
All right, Rama, we're going to let you go so we wrap up the show, but thanks so much

1539
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,240
for calling and giving us your report, okay?

1540
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,240
No problem.

1541
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,240
Thank you.

1542
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,240
All right, later.

1543
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,920
He really does sound like he was calling in from inside a cardboard box.

1544
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,360
We can do one more call here real quick, and then we're going to call it a night.

1545
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

1546
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,600
Who's this?

1547
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,600
Hello?

1548
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,600
Hi, who's this?

1549
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,160
You're on Orange Lawn Radio.

1550
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,160
This is Sinan from Finland.

1551
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,560
Oh, wow.

1552
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,520
We love getting listeners from far away.

1553
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,040
What's on your mind, my Finnish friend?

1554
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:39,440
I don't really have all that much in mind, I think, because it's early in the morning

1555
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,440
over here.

1556
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,440
I know.

1557
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,000
You've been staying up very late to listen to us live.

1558
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,360
We appreciate it.

1559
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:50,240
Well, I was off to work at the beginning, but I've been here one hour now, I think.

1560
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,240
Oh, very cool.

1561
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,320
Has there been a topic tonight that you wanted to chime in on?

1562
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,320
Something that...

1563
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,320
No.

1564
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,320
Not really.

1565
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,000
While at work, I listen to the five...

1566
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,920
What the fuck is this sound I'm hearing?

1567
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,960
It's Rob being silly.

1568
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,480
I think you're hearing us echoing.

1569
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,480
It's okay.

1570
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:16,000
All right, I don't think we've had someone call in just to say, hey.

1571
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,480
It's really because I listen to the five-year anniversary show, and I thought I would just

1572
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,480
drop in a line.

1573
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,320
After all, I got back from work, and I thought that maybe I could call in now and never again

1574
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,000
listen live.

1575
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,120
Did you enjoy the five-year anniversary show?

1576
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,120
Yeah, I did.

1577
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,480
I've been listening to this show for about one year now, but this is the first time I'm

1578
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,560
listening live, so I thought I would call in.

1579
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,560
All right.

1580
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,640
Well, welcome to the live experience, and thanks for letting us know that there's folks

1581
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,680
all around the world that listen to us.

1582
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,320
Hey, is E3 big news over there as well?

1583
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,240
Are you guys looking forward to the big E3 show here in the States?

1584
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,880
Yeah, of course.

1585
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,800
It's always, except for now, isn't it smaller nowadays?

1586
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,800
Well, a little bit.

1587
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,680
I mean, but it's still all the same news.

1588
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:06,160
The show itself might be small, but the news, I believe, is still going to stay the same.

1589
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:10,320
Is there anything that you hope will happen at this year's E3?

1590
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,520
I hope there will be some good information about Fallout 3, because that's a game I'm

1591
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,520
very interested in.

1592
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,120
Ah, Fallout 3.

1593
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,920
What is it about Fallout 3?

1594
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,320
Were you a fan of the first two games, or have you just seen the screenshots?

1595
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,320
Are you excited?

1596
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,420
What is it about Fallout that you love?

1597
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:29,600
I'm a huge Fallout fan, which means that Fallout 3 I'm pretty scared about, I think, is going

1598
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,600
to be shit.

1599
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,960
Why do you think that Fallout 3 is going to be shit?

1600
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,960
It's going to be Oblivion with guns.

1601
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:39,960
Oblivion with guns.

1602
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,840
But Oblivion is a freaking great game.

1603
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,920
But I guess, you know, maybe that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to translate well

1604
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,440
into a series like Fallout.

1605
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,440
No, I don't think so.

1606
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,720
And I don't really like Oblivion either.

1607
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,720
You don't like Oblivion?

1608
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,960
No, of course not.

1609
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,800
What were you playing it on?

1610
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,800
What system?

1611
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,440
Oh, I haven't been playing it.

1612
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,840
That's why I don't like it.

1613
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:06,200
I'm sorry, I'm thinking of a different game.

1614
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,200
It's alright.

1615
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,840
It's getting late over here, too.

1616
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:13,680
Alright, well, anything else you wanted to share with us quickly tonight before we let

1617
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:17,560
you go?

1618
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,560
Not really, I don't think so.

1619
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,840
Alright, well, that's alright, thanks so much for calling, it was certainly an entertaining

1620
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,480
call, we appreciate it, okay?

1621
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,480
I hope so.

1622
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,480
Alright.

1623
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,480
Let's watch some other shows and look at our time.

1624
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,480
Alright, sounds good.

1625
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,400
And we know you have to stay up late to listen live, so we appreciate that true fandom over

1626
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,920
there overseas, on the other side of the pond.

1627
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,480
Yeah, two ponds.

1628
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,280
Alright, oh yeah, that's right.

1629
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,800
It was just a hop, skip, and a jump, and an 18 hour flight, right?

1630
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,800
Alright, take care, buddy.

1631
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,800
Yep, take care.

1632
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,800
Later.

1633
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,800
Bye.

1634
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,800
Later.

1635
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,680
That's great.

1636
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,680
Not only was he, you know, he was from another country, which was kind of cool, but he just

1637
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,840
kind of called to say, hey, what's up?

1638
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,840
That was cool.

1639
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,840
What's up?

1640
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,840
How's it going?

1641
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,240
That was rad.

1642
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,120
That was a very fitting call for tonight, I think.

1643
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,120
That really were.

1644
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,740
Alright, unfortunately, I know there's still folks trying to call in, but we got to wrap

1645
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:14,680
it up and get the show done and move on to our, you know, very uninteresting lives.

1646
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,960
So we're going to now ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio.

1647
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,960
I think I have a few things.

1648
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,800
Well, yes, sir.

1649
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,800
Uh oh.

1650
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,560
There's rumors going around that Rock Band may be an Xbox 360 timed exclusive game.

1651
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:34,920
The reason being is because the invitation to their Rock Band E3 presentation had the

1652
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:41,160
Xbox 360 logo on there, but amazingly enough, the PlayStation logo was not on there.

1653
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,600
Could it be a mistake?

1654
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,600
I don't know.

1655
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,940
Although I know from all the videos that we've seen from, I think, the EA event, the game

1656
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:55,280
was being played on an Xbox 360 dev kit, not a PlayStation 3, so we'll find out pretty

1657
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,200
soon, I'm hoping.

1658
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:02,840
Other games possibly going to be delayed, Stuntman Ignition, the PlayStation 3 version

1659
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,040
is going to be delayed for that, apparently.

1660
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:11,760
Most likely going to slide from August to October this year.

1661
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,800
So that's kind of interesting.

1662
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:20,520
A game called Atari Classics has been spotted for the PSP on Gamefly.

1663
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,580
In the past, we've noticed that, of course, Gamefly has a lot of titles of stuff that

1664
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:32,680
have leaked, like beautiful Katamari before people notice or before they have the official

1665
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:36,300
announcement.

1666
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,380
Let's see what else here.

1667
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:44,000
There's a rumor also going around that Mario Kart Wii may be coming out this year, but

1668
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
in Europe.

1669
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:54,440
The rumor is that the US will be getting Smash Bros. Brawl in 2007 and Mario Kart in 2008,

1670
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:59,680
whereas Europe will be getting the opposite, Mario Kart in 2007 and Smash Bros. in 2008.

1671
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,600
What is this, Nintendo's apology to Europe by screwing us over?

1672
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,600
I want fucking Mario Kart.

1673
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,800
Fuck this Smash Bros. shit.

1674
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,680
You can all wait for Smash Bros.

1675
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,760
I want my cake and I'm going to eat it too.

1676
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,760
I want those things.

1677
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,400
I want more Mario Kart.

1678
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:20,360
The other one that's interesting is Battalion Wars 2 has been pushed back to October 29th

1679
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:23,040
and that I know is official.

1680
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:28,280
What makes that interesting though is there's no Wii game coming out in September.

1681
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:33,560
So if you think about it, and this is all speculation, but if you think about it and

1682
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:38,640
they wanted a pretty strong Wii title to compete against Halo 3 and whatnot, that would be

1683
01:22:38,640 --> 01:23:08,040
the perfect prime spot for Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

1684
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:13,200
Well, I understand you guys wanted to go to E3, I mean, there's always next year.

1685
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,320
That's right.

1686
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,320
Some other year.

1687
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:19,800
That's okay, we're having fun stomping and throwing a fit this year, it's fine.

1688
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,360
By the way, was it FU's of the week earlier today?

1689
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,360
Missed them.

1690
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,080
They were early in the show, sorry to say.

1691
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,080
I'm not angsty, so.

1692
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,960
Oh, I was going to say you could quickly throw one out as your final thought.

1693
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:37,880
Well, the only FU I had was Anime Expo, 07's organization this year, being an unorganized

1694
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:43,920
and having the staff pro-screw it all over for everybody else, especially with the scheduling.

1695
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,200
I have not been hearing good things about what went down there.

1696
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:50,760
And of course, everyone heard about the whole petition of trying to move Anime Expo 08 out

1697
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,760
of Los Angeles Convention Center.

1698
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,760
Wow.

1699
01:23:53,760 --> 01:24:00,940
Yes, there's been an extreme amount of debates over it, being held unsafe, and how the hotels

1700
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:05,880
are like two blocks away from the M. I say move it back to Disneyland.

1701
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:06,880
They love that.

1702
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,880
Oh, yeah.

1703
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,880
Oh, hell no.

1704
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,880
That was a nightmare.

1705
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:10,880
All right.

1706
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,880
Anyway, thank you very much, Jost.

1707
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,560
DarkSakura, your final thought?

1708
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,120
I'm going to Disneyland, bitches.

1709
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:23,960
My final thought is I want candy very badly, even though I shouldn't be eating more candy,

1710
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:24,960
but I really want candy.

1711
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,960
Oh, yeah.

1712
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,280
Don't forget about SacAnime this week.

1713
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,280
I won't.

1714
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,280
I won't.

1715
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,280
Loki, your final thought?

1716
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,720
Last but certainly not least, Loki.

1717
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:36,800
I have a kitty named after an Atari emulator.

1718
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,240
I didn't name the cat.

1719
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,840
Some old woman named the cat.

1720
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:44,680
As always, guys, thank you so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting
