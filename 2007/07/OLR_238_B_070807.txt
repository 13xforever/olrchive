Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
E3's going on!
And of course, as we talked about in Part A, one of the things that Sony is most likely going to be announcing at E3 is a $100 price drop for the PlayStation 3.
However, as we do record the show live on Sunday nights, sometimes things change as the show is going on.
Yes, Loki?
Yes, it's not a secret anymore.
It is official.
They have announced that the PlayStation 3 will be dropping, or I should say the PlayStation 3 68 system will be dropping to $499.
Um, actually this week.
The other announcement, though, is coming in August, they're going to be releasing the 80 gig model that's going to be also bundled with a retail copy of Motorstorm.
That is going to be at the $5.99 price point.
So, you know, everybody loves that $5.99 price point.
But at least it's nice to see that they're bundling a game in there as well.
I don't know.
A little bit more for your money, but still, not a whole lot.
That's probably going to be announced again at E3 and during Sony's so-called press conference.
Just thought we'd like to let you guys know about that.
Now on to other things.
Of course with E3 right around the corner, one thing that we loved last year, and they're doing it again, is Microsoft is going to be doing that Bring It Home thing where they actually have videos and demos from the show floor almost.
Last year we got to play
Test Drive Unlimited, and MotoGP 2006.
And there was one other one in there.
I don't know.
Fun stuff.
So this year, though, who knows what we're going to get, but we're going to get more of that, more demos, more game trailers and stuff like that, more free themes, hopefully.
And...
Also, they're not the only ones doing that.
This year, Sony is jumping on the bandwagon, so they say, and are going to be doing something very similar on the PlayStation Network as well.
You're going to have downloadable demos and videos and whatnot.
So, awesome.
I can't wait to download new demos because I like playing demos.
Do you think, and just indulge me here as silly as this thought might be, do you think that Microsoft might pull out a price drop of their own?
Possibly.
Possibly.
I, I, they're not gonna just be like, do-do-do-do-do, you know, whatever.
I don't think they need to, but, you know, now that Sony dropped their price, they might pull that thing where, where we think that our price point, you know, even though it's, it's $399, is still competitive with their price point, but they might be going by the leads, still, even though their leads are $20 less, supposedly.
Um,
Do you think they might throw in a free game or something to make the deal more lucrative?
SSJ100 Matt says not till after Halo 3 comes out would there be another price drop they very well might hold it off until after Halo comes out and just say boom here you go price drop let's sell some systems
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Eternal Sonata had a demo come out already but Blue Dragon will be getting a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace July 20th.
There is a Dengeki Online magazine in Japan that is claiming that a 1.1 gigabyte demo is going to be coming out over here in the US on July 20th.
It's going to be a two hour demo if this story is correct.
It's going to be a pretty intense demo.
It's only going to be available though for two weeks.
The demo will disappear on August 3rd.
So now it almost sounds like it's like a
Beta test or something, even though it's not an online game, so I don't know what the hell else to call it.
It's a limited time demo.
Kind of interesting.
It's just an incentive for you to play it, I guess.
But a two hour demo?
Really?
That sounds like a really good idea, especially if the game is going to be a bunch longer than that.
If they're trying to give a percentage of the game to get an idea of it.
It is supposed to be one of the first Xbox 360 games that's on two discs.
Interesting.
Well, and you know, and then I also think about, you know, your typical Xbox early adopter is not someone who's typically into these type of Japanese RPGs.
Because, you know, a lot of folks who have not picked up an Xbox 360 still, they do like these games and aren't impressed with the fact that Microsoft doesn't have them out.
But maybe having a very long two-hour demo is kind of a way to show these folks who maybe bought their Xboxes for the Maddens and burnouts of the world.
Give them their really first experience in a Japanese RPG and try to get some people sucked into the world through that.
I don't know, just a thought.
You know, to kind of go back a little bit, with the whole PlayStation Network doing almost like the bring it home thing, I really do hope they do this because lately their downloads and stuff and their content online has been pretty crappy.
I mean, and if they start kicking it up to maybe the Xbox Live level, that would be pretty awesome and that would definitely help them.
Because I know right now the 360, there's no shortage of new demos and games coming out each week.
All right, well, I will definitely be looking forward to the Blue Dragon demo, and I'll be downloading it, I'm sure, as a lot of you folks listening to the show will be.
Well, speaking of Xbox news, the Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be launched in Japan on October 11th.
And the price is going to be 47,800 yen, which in US dollars is 390.
So they're getting it cheaper than we did.
Good for them, I guess.
Well, I guess they need to be selling more Xboxes over in Japan, so why not release it cheap, eh?
They're trying.
All right.
Well, if you're in Japan and you've been holding out for an Xbox 360, maybe now's the time.
Who knows?
Well...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Now, the only problem, though, is the PlayStation 3 version has been delayed indefinitely.
So, the Xbox 360 one will be arriving September 11th on my birthday.
Awesome.
And PlayStation 3 will possibly later on if it's not cancelled by then.
Very interesting.
I mean, there's been plenty of games like this.
Splinter Cell, Double Agent, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, hell, Rainbow Six Vegas.
It
Just kind of continuing the trend that the PlayStation 3 is hard to develop for.
This is very interesting, kind of taking another topic here from Xbox 360 World.
Forza 2, you can create your own cars in Forza 2, right?
And you can create these cars and you can actually sell them in their little online auction.
Well, I'm surprised it took this long for a story like this to come out.
www.DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Not, you know, a giant twat on the hood of a car or something.
It's all sorts of offensive things.
Fuck me in the butt, like written on the side of the car.
I mean, this is just the tip of the iceberg, folks.
So how exactly do you stop this from happening?
Does a set of eyes have to look at every car that goes up?
Do you just allow this kind of shit to go on there and hope that people will warn or whatever they need to do?
What you need to do is they should have something, you know, report abuse or report, you know,
This is a fence, you know, something like that.
You know, if it's, do you think if it's breaking, you know, the terms of service or whatever, have it be reported and then they can take it down.
You know, kind of like eBay.
You know, and of course, Microsoft has their whole little online user policy that says you won't use our services to discriminate against, you know, somebody for a race or whatever.
Even though whenever you sign on to Xbox Live and you play some online game, it's usually, you know, NNNNFFFF and all those, you know, words getting dropped everywhere.
Like crazy.
Part of the charm, and I say that with over sarcasm there, the charm of Xbox Live.
That's why I only play Xbox Live with friends.
I very rarely will play Xbox Live with strangers.
And I rate every single one of them too.
If I play Xbox Live with strangers, they get rated by me.
Every time.
I rate them good or I rate them bad.
It'll be interesting to see if Sony, what Sony does in their whole future plan for online gaming as well.
Well, other stuff.
Yes.
Yes.
Other stuff has to do with Gears of War, the soundtrack.
Apparently the game is so popular that they are releasing the score to the game on soundtrack, you know, with tracks such as Train Ride to Hell.
Wow, if I'd known there were more songs like that in Gears of War, I might have tried to play it longer, although it was kind of frustrating me like crazy.
You know what?
They've been doing soundtracks to video games for years in Japan.
And we're just now getting all this goodness.
Just in recent years.
We've had some.
Like, you'll get, like, spotty, really.
Like, Gran Turismo 2 had a soundtrack.
I remember that.
We do get the Silent Hill soundtracks over here.
Yeah, they're very spotty, but you see them once in a while.
But, of course, I think in Japan, my God, like, every role-playing game that's major come out of there has a deluxe soundtrack that comes out five disc long.
Chrono Trigger soundtrack.
With art books attached to them, like my Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack.
Kind of interesting that over here you get a Gears of War soundtrack.
But, you know, the game's still insanely popular.
It's always in that top ten list.
I'm glad that they're doing this, though.
Oh, yeah.
There's games come out where I'd be like, well, I really want the music to this.
And, you know, I've actually got the new whatever Mana game just came out soundtrack.
Or how about like Grand Theft Auto, you know, Vice City.
But that was all like actual, you know, radio music.
That's sad that they never came out with a box set for Grand Theft Auto 3.
That had some pretty good stuff, especially on that techno trance station that they had on there.
I think that iTunes also opens the doors for a lot of this, too, because there's more and more game music on iTunes lately.
I know we had a story a few weeks ago about how Konami put a lot of their old classic songs up there, so it's kind of neat what you can find online and shopping online as well.
Thanks for watching!
Somebody got a response back from Microsoft saying that the surge protector was the cause of the Red Rings of Death.
And the reason, because the 360 is highly sensitive to reductions in power.
Even the slightest cut in power can cause things like the fans and DVD laser to malfunction.
Surge protectors can cause this, and probably 90% of the consoles they've seen fail in the 6-12 months of being plugged into a surge protector.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Microsoft's response to the whole Red Rings of Death thing.
But first, a game.
Let's play a game.
It's a little bit of a slow news week, thanks to E3 being right around the corner.
I mean, there has been some big news this week as things start to leak out before E3.
But during a slow news week, we like to play a game.
So tonight, we're going to play a little bit of Listless.
Listless
And the way that listless works, you guys, we're going to be creating the definitive list around a certain topic.
And the three hosts here in studio are going to play.
And Jonas is here with us.
We haven't heard a lot from him this segment, but he's been sitting here in studio with us, joined us during Part A. He's here with us.
How are you doing, Jonas?
Doing fine, and you?
All right, very good.
Explicit, also known as in the online world.
And you're going to be going to SAC Anime this weekend, too.
Yes, of course.
Talk to you guys about SakAnime, I'm not sure if you guys are going to be able to make it.
We'll be there, we don't know about the panel yet though, so let us know.
I'll try my best to get you to get the panel there.
For the whole three people in Sacramento to listen to this program, because this is a worldwide show, but we're hoping to get more, that's why we're going.
I can help promote this stuff.
Alright, sounds awesome.
Alright, well anyway, we'll talk about that later, but tonight we're going to talk about Listless, and tonight's topic is the most random thing we'd like to see at E3 this year.
Okay.
This is how it's going to work.
You can do serious things, crazy things, stupid things.
There is no limitation.
You can be serious, you can be stupid.
It doesn't matter because ultimately it will be in the hands of the chatroom.
The way this is going to work, I will name my top three, as will DarkSakura, Loki, and Exquisite.
It could be anything.
It could be an event, something that happens at a press conference, or it could be a game that's announced or whatever.
So anyway, chat room, if you'd like to make some suggestions, you can start yelling those out in chat.
But chat, you will actually play an important part because once we name our three lists, then the fun part comes.
We're going to go around and each one of us will take something off of the list.
So that's going to leave us with a list of eight.
In chat room, you're going to vote for your favorites.
and we will come up with a definitive list based on the chat room vote.
That's how Listless works.
This is an old game we used to do years ago on my college radio show.
It's lasted this long.
Anyway, so again the topic tonight, the most random thing we'd like to see at E3 this year.
It doesn't matter.
It can be serious, stupid, whatever you want because the chat room will ultimately decide what it's going to be.
So let's start it off.
Explicit, you're our guest tonight.
Why don't you start us off?
What would be the third most random thing you'd like to see at E3 this year?
Bill Gates getting pied in the face?
Well, I mean, that's happened before, okay.
And you know how everyone's talking about the red rings of death.
Oh, so you think someone will, like, you know, maybe a cherry pie to put a red ring of death on his face?
Yes.
Actually, I shouldn't say that, because somebody's going to totally misinterpret that.
We don't mean someone should actually do this, but it would be kind of... It might happen.
Come on.
Pies in the face are funny.
That's what Bozo the Clown used to do.
All right.
But if you actually do it, it's your ass that's going to jail.
All right, anyhow...
Loki, if you would, your number three thing you would most like to see happen at E3?
Nintendo actually releases online games, or games that are online.
Nintendo actually releases an online game to the shock and awe of many.
We knew, oh god, it was inevitable somebody was going to drop that one on us.
Alright, say no more.
Alright, let's see, I'm going to go next, because we'll save the best for last, Jamie.
Alright, my number three thing I would like to see happen at E3, I would like to see Sega publicly apologize for what they did to the Sonic franchise.
I would like to see Sega have a press conference and go, look, our bad.
So that's my number three thing.
Um, my number three.
If you're ready.
I am, I was just typing that into the computer.
Sega publicly apologize for Sonic.
Alright, yes.
Pyramid Head showing up killing everyone from G4.
Lovely.
So Pyramid Head will come in there with his sexy self and kill everyone from G4.
Not really, because again, we don't want to get sued or watched by the FBI or anything.
We don't really mean that, but Pyramid Head could come in there and lay the smack down.
This is silly or random.
I hope the chatroom liked it.
TheRobD says, that is pretty random.
All right.
Jonas, your number two most random thing you'd like to see happen at E3.
All right.
Okay.
I have the sense of this because Jamie said the person is banned in Orange Downs Radio.
All right.
If the initials are JT... Who shall not be named?
You can use that or Voldemort.
Him showing up at E3.
So, Voldemort attends E3.
That would be pretty random.
What would he be doing at E3?
Because you know the rumor is he was going to go to Penny Arcade Expo, but they couldn't work out an agreement there.
So what would Lord Voldemort be doing at E3?
Who knows?
He'll probably try to censor as many games as possible.
He'd be carrying the pie.
That's what it is.
That's what will happen.
All right, there you go.
Loki, your number two most random thing you'd like to see happen at E3?
This is less of what I... This is more than likely going to happen.
Um, because, you know, stupid things come out each year.
But more crappy games announced based off TV series.
Like, uh, Dancing with the Stars, or, um, God, I don't know.
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
Hey, Paula, the game.
Hey, Paula, the game.
God, if there is a God in heaven, please do not make this happen.
Hey, Paula, the game.
Let's see.
My number two thing I would like to see happen at E3.
I would like to see Nintendo not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.
That's what I'd like to see happen for once at E3.
I'd like to see Nintendo not announce one of their systems out in a new color.
I think that's self-explanatory.
Jamie?
Number two should be we be invited to be the official E3 podcasters.
So Jamie's showing a little bit of ego there.
OLR, the official ambassadors to the podcasting universe for E3.
So I'm going to put OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors.
Is that good?
And why would they pick us?
Because of my boobs?
I don't know.
So then ambassadors with emphasis on the ass.
Whatever.
Whatever.
Alright, OLR sells out at E3 08.
Alright, number one, the number one thing you would like to see happen at E3 this year.
Explicit.
Okay, this might get me a little hated here, but Halo 3 delayed or cancelled.
Halo 3 delayed or cancelled, that would be pretty funny.
This would be funny, I wanted to see what the fans would say about this if they say it was delayed.
I don't actually see it, but remember, this is random or whatever you want, so this is your little sick fantasy is that you want to see the Halo fanboys have a cry.
Loki, the number one thing you would like to see happen at E3 this year?
This honestly is something I really hope to see.
Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.
And it actually sticks.
Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced, or they could come out and say it's out today.
Oh my god, if they did that on Xbox Live Arcade, oh
that would be awesome my number one thing is that I would like to see at E3 all the old Kensha Hall exhibitors picketing outside the auditorium or how about like you know pickaxes and torches just there chanting hell no we won't go and all that stuff alright Jamie your number one thing Skye's voice the game
Please explain this classic Oelarian joke for the sake of our new listeners.
It was Rob singing Bumblebee with different lyrics.
So Konami announces Sky's voice the game.
Yeah.
It's their latest in their Bomani series.
Thank you.
My ego feels good for that.
All right, there we go.
So let's recap the big list we have here.
This is very wordy, you guys.
You might have to kind of lean in a little bit to see this, but I'll make the font bigger there so we can all read.
Let me just kind of make that nice and...
E3 2007 Pi Bill Gates in the face Nintendo actually releases an online game Sega publicly apologizes for Sonic
PyramidHead shows up and kills everyone from G4.
Lord Voldemort goes to E3.
More crappy games based off of TV series like Hey Paula the Game.
Nintendo not announces one of their systems coming out in a new color.
OLR is named E3 Podcasting Ambassadors.
Halo 3 is delayed or cancelled.
Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.
Kensha Hall's exhibitors picket outside the theater.
and Konami announces Sky's Voice the game as the latest in the Bomani series.
It's a pretty good list, but unfortunately this list is not perfect.
So we need to go around and take ones off the list.
So, Explicit, we'll start with you.
Which one of these items is not worthy of being on the list?
They're all good, but... This is hard tonight.
This is hard tonight.
This is hard.
Hmm...
Oh, man.
I guess I'll have to play the little dance music while Jonas thinks there.
I'll have to go with Nintendo and not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.
Because you know it's inevitable that's actually going to happen, right?
Yeah.
All right.
So, Explicit takes out the line about Nintendo will not actually... Whatever.
It's gone.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
Um...
No.
Bill Gates getting pied in the face.
Bill Gates is normally not really at these events too much.
If it was like Peter Moore getting pied in the face, maybe.
I don't know.
All right.
Let's see.
What would I like to put off the list?
I am going to pull off the list.
I'm going to pull off Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.
because, come on, it's the laughing stock of the industry, and we can't have that ruined at E3 this year.
It was a good thought, but this is just hard.
It's a hard list.
It's a hard list, so Jamie gets the last remove.
What are you going to take off the list?
He shall not be named showing up at E3 because it ain't going to happen.
Yeah, we wouldn't want that.
It's invite only, bitch, and you weren't invited.
You don't get to crash this party.
All right, incoming large paste into chat.
You guys are going to vote for your top two, your number one and your number two.
The order is important.
I will assume your first answer is the number one.
You're going to send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
Real quick, sorry, this is kind of an afterthought, but nonetheless.
It'd be funny to see the people at Gamecock, the ones doing the EIEIO thing, to actually have a Trojan rooster come to the E3 thing and try to see if they can get him to put it in there.
And everyone will jump out and...
Here are our finalists for tonight's list list.
We're going to open up voting to the chat room right now.
Vote for your number one and number two picks.
We'll tally them up during the next few stories and reveal the answers to you later in the show.
Here we go.
Things we'd like to see at E3 07.
Nintendo actually releases an online game.
Sega publicly apologizes for what they did to Sonic.
Pyramid Head shows up and kills everyone from G4.
More crappy games based off of TV series.
OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors.
Halo 3, Delayed or Cancelled, Kensha Hall Exhibitors, Pickett Outside the Theater, Sky's Voice the Game.
Why didn't I take that off the list?
Sky's Voice the Game, announced by Konami.
All right, there you have it.
Let's get back into the gaming news while the votes come in.
Gold Farmers are a pain in your ass
and Blizzard did a good job with their latest patch though they really managed to squelch the amount of spam that was going out thanks to the limitations they made on trial accounts but that just means the gold farmers have gotten a little more creative I am actually still getting tell spam once in a great while from gold farmers but it's gone way down but this has got to be one of the most creative things we've seen in a long time and that is that these folks now are creating level 1 gnome characters and
and killing themselves in the main alliance town of Ironforge and spelling out the name of their website I'm not going to read the name of the website but you can see pictures around the internet all these corpses laid out in like .com such and such site I don't want to plug the site because they're cunts for doing this to the game and need to just stay the hell out of the game but you have to give them props at least for being creative why can't we see this kind of advertising in real life
Blizzard, by the way, one of their reps wrote on their own forums, I ask that any player that witnesses these to report them straight away.
If you feel so inclined, you can also post the realm name and zone here, and I can see what can be done about getting them handled that way.
Please, once it's reported, leave the bodies alone.
Do not linger around or huddle near the bodies.
In other words, don't give them the attention that they're looking for.
Apparently, I read somewhere else, somebody actually caught one of these midway through.
It stopped.
You just see all these bodies saying .com.
You don't see the rest of the site name because I guess the Blizzard folks banned the IPs for too long.
Kind of a creative way to get around.
If nothing else, it's very creative.
I'll give them that, even if they are annoying as hell.
Going to the chat room, James Patrick says, That's awesome.
Dead body advertising is great.
Sephiroth1215 says, Yeah, it kind of sucks, but for those sad lives of WoW players, it is really funny.
Hey, wait a minute.
That's me you're talking about.
Jerk.
All right, more news while I tally votes.
Well, for anyone who plays Second Life, apparently there is now going to be a build of Tokyo in Second Life done by Tetsuya Mizuguchi.
He's doing actually a reimagined Tokyo for the...
I'm trying to actually get a little bit more on that.
Right, they're doing, actually completely recreated Tokyo from what it's saying.
He wants to do what Tokyo appears to both locals and visitors, something that's a matter of perception.
He's quoted actually saying a museum of Japanese pop culture.
So, yeah.
Kind of interesting.
I'd like to see how that turns out.
Even though I don't really want to play Second Life.
Anyways, interesting thing also coming to PCs.
Dead or Alive Online is coming to PCs pretty soon.
And it's supposed to be a brand new game in the series.
It won't just be some stupid port.
And so yeah, you will be able to see the Dead or Alive jubblies, I guess, bouncing up and down on your PC in high res.
Hooray.
But you like that, yes?
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong.
It's awesome.
Unfortunately, since it is on PC, it's been done before by other companies, and they've actually had it where you can strip clothes off of people and stuff while you're fighting in the game.
Well, hey, you know, this Dead or Alive game, of course, you know, there's a lot of Dead or Alive games on the Xbox 360, but thanks to the Red Rings of Death, some folks have not been able to play them.
Well, you know, the internet threw a fit, even the UK was starting to investigate Microsoft, and finally Microsoft this week said, alright, enough, we fucked up, we're sorry.
Peter Moore came out and said
to address specifically the general hardware failures indicated by the three flashing red lights on the console.
This applies to new and previously sold consoles.
So in other words, for three years, and the Xbox 360 hasn't even been out that long yet, your console's covered.
If you get the three rings of death, you don't have to pay to have it fixed.
That means all the people who bought extended warranties
Well, they may cover other failures.
This is only for the three red rings of death.
So the extended warranty does cover all the other things that could go wrong.
But certainly, a lot of folks are applauding Microsoft for this move.
Now, it would be nice if the three red rings of death would never show up in the first place.
But since Microsoft can't magically cure all the 360s that are already out there, I suppose this is the next best thing.
Any thoughts from the folks here in studio on the whole warranty policy change?
I think it's pretty cool.
I'm glad to see that they're actually covering this stuff anyways.
And then hopefully, I'm assuming since the rumor's been going around that they're redesigning the cooling on it, that this will fix the problem and any of these consoles that are still out there that are failing because of this will get fixed.
And we won't have to hear about it anymore.
Apparently Peter Moore has actually joined our chat room or someone impersonating him.
Peter Moore says, we're sorry, have this three year warranty for the three red lights.
See, one year for every light.
There you go, bravo.
Nice.
So, there are three lights?
I guess, yeah.
I got the error one time.
I'm joking, Rob.
I hate you.
You know what?
Mailbag segment's canceled tonight.
Okay.
Jamie doesn't... You can read it.
No, I don't want to read it.
I had to read it last week because you weren't here.
When you send in your emails to mailbag at orangelonsradio.com, obviously we care very deeply about your emails that you send in to us.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Dear Rob, Jamie, and Loki, last week you put out the call for developers who listen to this show to write in, and in that regard I qualify.
Three weeks ago I started working at Bottle Rocket Entertainment, the team responsible for the Mark of Kree and its sequel on PS2, as an environment artist.
Oh, that's cool.
For the people unsure what that entails, it's pretty much what it sounds like.
Environment artists build the art assets for the level in the game.
Since I just started recently, I have no grizzled words from the trenches of the horrors of game development, but I wanted to write in anyway as I've been listening to your show since last fall.
Actually, I wanted to thank you guys for the work that you do.
I listen to OLR and other podcasts at work.
and it makes my day that much more enjoyable.
In fact, aside from the caffeine, I basically had to subsist on podcasts to get me through the last bit of art school before I got this job.
I love OLR in particular because your enthusiasm for your program shows and as a result, every episode is guaranteed to entertain.
Thank you for all the work you put into this.
One last thing, my point of view of game development might be somewhat myopic at this point, but I know people have questions about
and I might be able to provide some answers.
I can't talk about anything related to the projects we're working on, but if any of your listeners want to know what it's like working in a game company or how best to break into the industry or anything like that, I might be able to help just putting that out there.
Sincerely, yours, Devin L. Well, maybe we'll have to have Devin on the show at some point.
Ask a developer.
That might be kind of fun.
That'd be cool.
But that's kind of neat to know that people on the inside are listening to the program and that always makes us feel pretty good, you know.
and certainly we were talking about the guy that worked for the Japanese developer.
He actually was sending me some pictures from Japan.
I actually have to show you.
He sent me some pictures from a pinball arcade in Japan, so I have to show it.
Nice.
So, kind of cool.
So thank you to the developers that listened to the show.
Just like any other listener, we really appreciate your support.
Well, we got one from the Rob D.
I was listening to last week's show on the way home from work yesterday, and yes, my quiz will label you as super spastic if you suck in that game.
I'm always amused when an issue with this word comes up because it shows a giant cultural divide between the USA and the UK that no one is really aware of.
For whatever reason, the word spaz is highly offensive in the UK, even to the point of the Spastic Society, a non-profit organization to aid those with cerebral palsy, changing its name to SCOPE.
In the US, the surfer lingo of the SoCal area made the word spaz a common insult among youth to this date.
A few years ago, Tiger Woods got in huge trouble with his UK fans when he said that he had played the best I've played for years, and as soon as I got on the green, I was a spaz during last year's Masters.
Of course, Americans had no idea what the problem was.
Merriam-Webster's doesn't even mention cerebral palsy and its definition of the word spaz.
A little side note, whenever I hear spastic, I think of spastic colon.
Anyway, back to the email.
Although not the most popular, by far the worst and funniest documented case of this happening is when an American wheelchair manufacturer decided to export one of their products to Great Britain for sale there.
Unfortunately, the name of this product was called, I kid you not, The Spaz with two Z's.
You can imagine how well that went over.
Apparently there's a link there, but our thing is not HTML, so poo.
On one hand, I feel sort of bad for the wheelchair company, but the name was cruel in the first place.
Isn't that kind of like selling a walker and calling it gimpy or marketing headgear for children with really bad teeth as the most unpopular kid in school brand?
Anyway, I guess the closest analogy I can make is if some Asian company wanted to make a humorous shirt that said, I'm chicken on the front and accidentally instead of using the word cock instead of chicken, not realizing how offensive it is.
Great show.
I keep up and keep up the good work.
Maybe you'll actually get to 500 episodes like I accidentally said you already had on your five-year show, Rob D. You know, I find the term scope offensive because it makes me think of mouthwash, which in turn makes me think of the dentist.
And I find dentists to be highly offensive because of what they charge me when I go in there to have my teeth cleaned.
So I find that term to be offensive.
So...
Obviously, I'm just messing around.
But, you know, we learned a lot about some of those cultural word differences last week.
You know, I had no idea that that was an offensive term over there.
But, you know, it's just part of the world we live in and all those funny little cultural differences.
More stuff.
More stuff.
Ossifer, once again.
Thank you.
And, yeah, Rob, you were drunk.
Quit denying your past.
Huh?
What did I do this time?
I'm just going to read on.
I swear, Ossifer, I wasn't drunk.
I think that's what it's referring to.
Anyway, thanks a lot for introducing me to this long anniversary from Powder Powder Paradise with a question mark.
I've been listening to it every day, multiple times a day, bolded, ever since, yeah, can you tell that I love it?
So yay for Rob.
Rob is cool.
Rob fan mail for the win.
Yay, I got fan mail.
But I can't leave Loki or Jamie out, so you all kick ass.
Smiley face.
Oh, boo, I want to be by myself and then love.
Bite my butt, Rob.
Your beloved listener, Osfer.
P.S.
Supernova location test back on.
Maybe during the time it was canceled, they made the game better.
Thoughts, EMUs, maybe?
Wasn't there some news on the whole Supernova test thing this week, like it's back on now?
In fact, I think it was posted to our own site, but that was the wonderful... The wonderful Dark Tetsuya actually stays on top of a lot of that stuff.
Yeah, the Supernova 2 test is back on again for July 12, 2007.
That's funny because that would be right around the same time as E3.
But yeah, that's what is floating around the internet apparently.
Can I read more email please?
Of course.
Thank you sir, may I have another?
Hi Orange Lounge Radio, this is a quick email from Mori.
Unfortunately for the past two weeks my computer has been relatively out of commission so I wasn't able to send along this message any sooner.
Excuses, excuses.
But congrats on five years and two weeks of being on the air.
Five years and two weeks as of today, yeah.
I've listened to your show for about a year and a half now, and since the last few episodes of the original OLR2GO edition of the podcast, you guys are the only show that I can actually sit down and listen to all the way without losing interest.
In short, you guys are great.
Thanks.
And we have a tilde at the end of the thanks.
Thank you.
But besides that, a few weeks ago I heard someone mention the Sega Pico at one point in the episodes.
I have fond memories of mine, which is currently sitting in a box in my closet.
I actually pulled it out and played around with it after hearing that basically it was Sega and edutainment.
I did, however, have something vaguely resembling a touchpad, which I forgot about.
Anywho, considering the apparently huge amount of systems DarkSakura owns, by any chance does she have one?
This has been something I've been wondering about for a while, since obviously I have nothing better to do.
Actually, I do not own a Pico.
I came very close to purchasing a Pico at Toys R Us, but we bought a Nomad instead.
I figured Nomad, Pico, you know, Nomad high on the pedestal.
However, I actually have been looking for a Pico since last week.
But Bill's and I'm going to Disneyland at the end of the month.
So Disneyland.
Addict.
Disneyland greater than Pico.
Teacups are better than Pico.
I know and I'm going to freaking ride the hell out.
I hate you.
Because the teacups go faster at night, Rob.
I hate you for going to Disneyland on the weekend.
I have to move.
which in turn will probably be no OLR that week but we're changing studios so what can you do?
And in closing, thanks again for your awesomeness and I hope to actually call in on the show one day.
Owen Sky's GameTap promotion made me subscribe to it.
Not quite as big of a purchase as a $60 game but still I thought it was worth mentioning.
Maury, possibly the second youngest listener at 14?
That doesn't help because people think I'm already up there in bed with them but I swear I'm not.
I think they're good.
Well, I have to say though, 14 and having, I have to say for a 14 year old, you have some of the best grammar in an email I have ever seen.
Nothing was misspelled.
You had one typo.
I have to say that you are a shining example of our public education system working, unless you go to private school.
So who's this again?
Maury.
Maury, our listener of the week, everybody.
Give it up.
You are the emailer of the millennium.
So there you go.
This one is by Schwal...
22, I guess.
Hey guys, been a while since I've written and I had to correct Loki's misuse of a word last week.
When referring to a mentally handicapped person, it's retard.
Example, that guy is a fucking retard.
When referring to music, that's R-I-T-A-R-D, short for retardando, which means to gradually become slower.
I actually was the one last week that said that retard is used in music.
But I knew it was the misspelling, but you still say it the same way.
Well, that's just two different spellings, same pronunciation.
Oh, well, keep up the good work.
I really have been enjoying this show.
Oh, oh, more people should play Overlord.
It's funny as hell.
Buy it so we get a sequel.
Okay.
Will do, chief.
Hey, Loki, retard your anger.
Next email, last email is from Nintendomaniac64.
Okay.
Hi, hola, bonjour, guten tag, konnichiwa, etc.
Although actually it's evening for us, so it would be konbanwa?
Anyway.
Oh my god, picky lady.
This is me, Rob.
I'm going to go get a water.
Oh, whatever.
This question is pretty much unrelated to OLR, but I may need the input by a largest group of people, a.k.a.
the chatroom, and not be completely ignored due to the uber speed that the comments travel at in the said chatroom.
Anyway, I'm finally going to be in an M3 Perfect, which is the slot 2 version to replace my broken supercard CF, which had a connector pin.
This has nothing to do with the... Well, you said it had nothing to do with the show.
Okay, chat room, I'm just going to read the question, okay?
um it said to replace my broken supercard CF which had a connector pin in the CF slot break off yes I tried to solder it back and it still doesn't work my question is if you or the chat room know if there are any mini or micro SD cards that are 4 gigabyte but not SDHC since the M3 the perfect isn't compatible with SDHC I'm still not sure if I'm going to get a 2 gig or 4 gig SD card but if there are any 4 gigabyte mini or micro non SDHC cards my problem is solved right there
and if anyone yells in the chat room and get an R4 or something, he needs 32 megabyte of extra RAM.
Okay, whatever.
This has nothing to do with the show.
I'm not going to read your answer.
Email people, okay?
Your question fails.
And we have an email from Sauce.
This says, Dear Rob, there are four lights.
Love, Tiara.
There are four lights, but only three show...
I can't wait to play Rob's voice the game to Iraqi Suicide Babies.
I'm sorry, I left the room when I heard Nintendo Maniac 64 send an email, but then I heard my name.
Just kidding, hearts.
What's that?
This email's from Sauce.
Dear Rob, there are four... Yes, but when the system breaks, there's only three that come on.
What's it say?
P.S.
I can't wait to play Rob's Voice the Game 2, Iraqi Suicide Baby.
Because four blinking lights means that your AV cable is unplugged.
Best email ever, except for the 14-year-old that can spell shit.
All right, close the mailbag.
We're way over time.
Mailbag is belated.
All right, if you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelongerator.com.
And maybe Jamie will make fun of you on air next.
or or compliment your grammar I would actually like to see we should have a grammar contest let's see if there's some 13 and 12 year olds that want to send in some emails and try to one-up Mori wouldn't that be exciting awesome uh so anyways I guess the ongoing quest to get Mother 3 translated is um going pretty well now two teams have kind of joined forces on the project and um
I don't know.
No word on yet when it's going to be done, but... Well, actually, no.
Yes, there was a small update.
They said that they're shooting for a release this year.
So... Awesome, I guess?
I don't know.
Not much a fan of Mother 3, but... Great.
I fucking love EarthBound.
Why doesn't Nintendo, I don't know, translate the game themselves?
Sell it here?
Because they're dumbasses.
Because they would rather, you know...
Redo Picross and release it on the DS.
There's so much Nintendo hate tonight.
I apologize to the Nintendo fans, but I don't.
It's alright.
Next week will be a Nintendo love.
That's true.
I know there's a lot of love for this this week.
Rock Band had some footage hit the internet and a lot of folks were very, very happy about this.
I'm going to play this in studio here because I'm sure not everybody has seen it.
Oh, never mind, I can't.
It got taken off YouTube.
But basically, okay, imagine Guitar Hero side by side three times and Karaoke Revolution on top.
That's kind of what Rock Band looked like.
And the video, I guess, was leaked to the Internet, so then Harmonix kind of had to step in and put something a little more legit out there and kind of confess to what was going on.
and mentioned that the song that you heard in there, Welcome to the Jungle, was just a demo song and may not actually be in the final version of the game.
That was so awesome.
It looked like a shitload of fun.
Did you guys see the clip?
Oh my god, yes.
Yeah, it looks good.
The only negative complaint I've heard on it is that maybe the karaoke part is too small, which could be very hard to see on a regular TV.
I don't know about that, but it looked pretty good.
But doesn't everybody have a widescreen HDTV these days, huh?
Well, it's not so much that, but shouldn't everyone...
Shouldn't everyone know the lyrics to Welcome to the Jungle?
I mean, shouldn't you know this song by heart?
I don't know the lyrics.
See, I could just make it up.
I don't need the... There's other words in there too, but who cares?
Will this game let you cheat like Karaoke Revolution does?
No, they supposedly have a thing that detects the phonics in your voice so that you're not going to be able to go... You know, like, what was it, um...
It's the end of the world as we know it, where it's like, uh, you know, the whole song.
That's how I sing it's the end of the world as we know it in Karaoke Revolution.
Have you ever played any of the Japanese versions of Karaoke Revolution?
I have not.
They actually make sure that you are pronouncing everything right.
Wow.
They're very, very specific.
Let's see.
TheRobD says that was the greatest rendition of Welcome to the Jungle ever.
See why they want Sky's voice in the game?
Ego plus five right there.
Plus four strength, plus four stam, plus four ego.
Actdeft says, is telling the Rob D, Harmonix says it won't be that expensive.
Oh, because the Rob D said, Rock Band Eagles, expensive game I won't be buying.
So, I don't know.
It could be fun, though.
Jamie will buy it, because she loves those types of games.
Unfortunately, I will probably get suckered into buying it, like I did with Guitar Hero 2, and then I won't play it again.
I will not do the karaoke portion of the game, though.
I think I might.
Please, one time on the show, do the karaoke.
Never!
Please, can't you do Welcome to the Jungle?
No, but you just did such a wonderful rendition there.
Even though I hate Loki right now, I still love Jamie for now.
So I will allow her a chance to share with you all her website of the week.
Because she was out last week.
So she's got to make it extra good this week.
DarkSakura.
I was dead sore last week.
Where should the kids be pointing their websites, browsers this week?
The website of the week is newsaskew.com.
Because it's Kevin Smith.
And I don't need to tell you anything else.
It's freaking Kevin Smith.
News for View Askew MoviePoopShoot.com
I seem to remember that Kevin Smith will actually post on his forums and stuff.
He's actually got a blog up too.
Oh, cool.
Called My Boring Ass Life.
The internet did forgive him for Jersey Girl though, right?
I think so.
I think it's fair to say the internet.
I never did see Clerks 2 though.
I should hang my head in shame.
I need to go rent it.
I do need to see it.
How did I miss it?
I don't still watch any movies anymore.
It's sad.
And Kevin Smith has a MySpace too.
Does he?
I should add him.
I love The Evening with Kevin Smith.
That's like one of my favorite DVDs ever.
All right, newsaskew.com.
Check it out when you're taking a break from games.
Does Kevin Smith admit that he plays video games?
I would imagine he does.
He seems like a big nerd.
I don't think so.
Well, how come there hasn't been a Jay and Silent Bob video game?
That's what I want to know.
Maybe someday.
Good question.
Anywho...
There's some interesting news coming from Australia.
Apparently, a sort of affair between a 31-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy went awry, and she was arrested for kidnapping charges.
The whole thing took place over World of Warcraft, where apparently the 31-year-old... I'm just going to assume that she was a MILF, because, you know, she's... Well, no, of course not.
Anyways...
Then again, if she's hitting on 17-year-old boys, who knows?
I know.
MILF?
Does that mean, like, mom is large and fat?
Is that MILF?
Anyways.
So, apparently she was, you know,
Creating this deep and trusting relationship with her barely legal boyfriend for more than a year.
How do you form a deep and trusting relationship on World of Warcraft?
I don't know.
I will give you this four-strength, four-stam leather belt if you will eat my pussy.
I don't know.
How do you do that?
Or I'll give you a Leroy Jenkins.
Is that a new sexual term?
Is that what these two say during... Oh, I shouldn't even say that.
I shouldn't use that as bad.
Never mind.
But anyways, apparently she was going to... Was it... She was going to meet the boy and they were going... Because she lived in Australia, but she was going to meet him.
I guess he lived out of country and basically take him with her and they were going to fly to Australia and he was going to live with her.
And apparently the parents found out about it and had her arrested.
Wait, so she was Australian?
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
Wow.
What's wrong with you guys in Australia and your MILFs?
No, I'm just kidding.
Obviously, it's one bad apple ruining the barrel.
I'm sure the media hasn't gone crazy with this story about how World of Warcraft is predator for children and blah, blah, blah.
Dateline NBC special about the scary MILFs on Warcraft reaching out.
Buying plane tickets for 17-year-old boys.
The boy lived in North Carolina.
So I would assume that the age of consent, of course, here is usually over 18.
That's a long plane ride.
He'll probably be 18 by the time he gets to Australia.
So what's so wrong with that?
You know, with the time zone changes and the date line, you know.
He's 18.
Exactly.
Alright, well we are just about done with all the stories for tonight.
And we are going to be opening up the Skype line for you guys to call in and interact with our program.
If you want to give us a call, you can call us on Skype.
Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
Or you can call us on our 800 number, or I should say 877 number.
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Excuse me, we will take...
Your calls very soon.
However, first, we have another score to settle.
And that's tonight's list list.
We need to know who won tonight's list list.
The topic tonight, of course, most random things we'd like to see at this year's E3.
We have winners.
And let's reveal them now.
Number three, the number three thing our chat room would like to most see happen to E3 this year.
Halo 3 gets delayed or canceled.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Pyramid Head must show up and kill everyone.
Yes!
There you have it.
Tonight's definitive list of the needs of E3 2007.
Alright, let's open up the Skype line and take some calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR Did they do a good job tonight, you think?
I think they did a good one.
I don't know.
I think they came up with a good list.
I don't know what you guys think.
Alright, let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Raven's Dolphin!
Oh, surprise, surprise.
How did you get through Raven's Dolphin?
My new Mac, that's why.
Do you have us on speed dial?
Yes.
Alright, well, it worked.
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
Well, the E3's coming up, and I know everyone's really excited, and the thing about it is, it's very small.
Does it feel weird to you that it's now instead of it was in May?
To me, it was around my birthday, and I was like, yeah, E3's coming up!
And I'm like, now it's like, E3's up?
Well, yeah, but at the same time as we were kind of saying in part A, just because it's a smaller show doesn't mean the companies have any less or more to gain.
And there's going to be press there that's just as, you know, as honest as there were in years past.
I think enough people have managed to get in, even though it's supposed to have been a lockdown show or whatever.
So I don't really see what's exactly changed except for the fact that, you know, little podcasters like us and little press and foreign press and GameStop employees don't get in and Best Buy employees and all that crap.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You know, we're still going to get the press conferences like we normally do.
So, I don't see much of a change like you said.
You know, we're still going to see it.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens as E3 goes on.
It's going to be hard to say.
And you could say that there's not as many people to tear apart the demos or base their opinion of games right off the demos, but you're seeing the whole Xbox Live and PlayStation 3 become more and more and more.
You know what I mean?
You can download those on their own live or PlayStation Network services, so you can get a lot of those demos, actually.
I'm really excited for actually bringing it home.
And that's going to be really interesting because they did an okay job with it last year.
But for the people like me saying, oh, my, ooh, Lost Planet's on Xbox Live.
I was at E3 last year, and I still enjoyed the Xbox Live, you know, watching their videos from the show floor because I kind of actually liked seeing some of the booths I went to at E3.
It was kind of fun.
So I don't know.
Maybe I'm just weird like that.
Yeah, I'll be home too, but Scott got that thing on his head.
Yeah, I heard about that over at Allgame.
What the hell is that?
He bought a webcam for his head?
He's going to E3?
See, with stuff like that, you're not going to keep people out of E3.
Where there is information, there will be people seeking it out.
One more thing, RavenSolven?
Yeah, one more thing.
I just bought this Mac, and no, I'm not using games because there's no such thing as games on the Mac!
So what did you buy the Mac for, angry one?
I bought it because of change.
And no, Loki, don't kill me.
Don't pick up that pitchfork.
He'll be okay.
No, no, no, I'm not switching.
No.
All right, well, thanks for the call, Raven Stolven.
Take care, buddy.
You too, bye.
All right, bye-bye.
All right.
By the way, Maury, our emailer of the week, sent me a private message in chat.
Maury says, just for clarification, I am in public school.
Ah, well then, wherever you are, congrats to your public school system.
Give your English teachers mad props for me.
And mad props to you for paying attention.
I want to show you this on air real quick because there's not a lot of calls coming in right now.
So we want more calls.
But look at this.
Somebody just sent me the link for this in chat.
This is actually what they're doing at E3.
And you can see that Scott is on... I can see your arm.
I'm sorry.
You can see Scott is on live right now playing Texas Hold'em.
Although I think he must have it hooked into his TV or something.
Oh, he's filing a complaint against somebody right now on Xbox Live.
Isn't that weird?
That's pretty cool.
It's like reality TV gone crazy.
SSJ100 Matt says, Link, rush out the fuck up.
My god, I'd love to do this with my cat while I'm, you know, wait for the day.
Normally at work, you know, the cat stays in the bedroom.
I should put a camera up on the wall or something.
I tried to say hi from OLR in the chat room, but it wouldn't let me because I didn't have a nickname, so...
Legend of Zaku How was anime next?
It was alright though, I mean, I know I was rooming with Ranma, so it was even better
Um, yeah, I, yeah, since I think he's not here right now, he's supposed to be calling you to give you the scoop on everything.
Actually, wait, hold on, hold on.
Hello?
Hey, what's up?
Oh, I put Zaku on hold because I saw you calling in on the back line.
Can I conference?
How do I conference?
Hold on, let me see.
This might put you on hold.
Cool.
Zaku, are you still there?
Yeah.
Okay, Ranma's actually on the other line.
We just had to put him on hold.
God damn it.
How do we conference?
Can't you conference in the studio?
Oh, wait, there's a button that says conference.
Join current call to another call.
This is live radio, boys and girls.
Okay.
Hello?
Yeah.
No, I'm conferencing with you.
Hold on.
We're going to call you right back.
All right.
Live radio, boys and girls.
Hi, you still there, Ranma?
Hello?
I fucked it all up.
Ranma!
Ranma!
Now I just lost our entire Anime Next report.
Let's just call Zaku back.
Hi.
It didn't work, so whatever.
Just give us your report and then we'll hope Ranma calls back.
What's on your mind?
Yeah, basically, between the agreement between me and him, I'm covering the gaming aspect of it.
So far, their gaming room, I mean, it has the usual stuff, Halo, Dirt Strike, they added stuff like, you know, Guitar Hero, and the inevitable 2DX setup, which was mediocre at best.
Yeah, but that's about it, they had tournaments on certain games, like Smash Bros.,
Was there any new stuff in the game room?
Stuff you hadn't seen before?
Only the guitar gear from what I heard since they replaced the DDR setup with that.
They used the 360 version.
Oh, interesting.
Okay.
And so they held tournaments on that and Gears of War.
But besides that, they were also selling a lot of imports in the dealer's room within the convention hall.
So I managed to snag a copy of Fifth Style for like $40.
Very cool.
What about any gaming paraphernalia, for lack of a better word?
Like this Ball Fair figure came from something like that.
Yeah, they were all in the dealer room.
There was a lot of cosplayers dressing up as Mario and other video game characters.
But yeah, most of the good merchandise... I bet you didn't see someone dressed up as a Wii Remote.
Oh, actually, close.
An actual Wii, with the other person holding the Wii mode behind them.
Jonas, I think someone stole your idea.
Wait, they cosplay as an actual Wii system without the Wii mode?
Yes.
No, an actual Wii system, and then this other person was holding the Wii mode for them.
I heard rumors that that showed up in Sack Enemy in January.
If that is the case, I might see him on Sack Enemy in July.
You're talking about an East Coast thing, I don't know.
Who the hell would come to SAC for an anime convention if you don't live here?
Or the Bay Area, maybe.
You're talking about something that happened in Jersey, not Sacramento.
Alright, look.
Now stop the whole bi-coastal thing.
Zaku, anything else you want to share on the game room?
That's pretty much about it, I mean...
You know, it was really... The only thing I can say that really pissed me off was just the fact that it was too small and they were just controlling crowds.
Basically, it was basically almost like a nightclub where they just had people just waiting there in line.
You know, since the game room was packed most of the time anyways.
So, yeah.
Alright, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can go to Ranma and get his side of the story on what's going on.
Anything else you want to say about the con real quick?
It was alright.
I mean, it's my first con, so I really don't have that much to say.
All I need to know is that I need to go to more conventions.
But you want to go to more cons now?
Yeah, I guess I got a plan for next year.
Oh, it's a con!
Well, I guess that's a good sign.
Alright, who knows?
I'm hoping next year I'll be able to afford an East Coast con, so we'll see.
Alright.
Alright, later, Zaku.
Alright, later.
And of course, now that I'm finished with Zaku, Ranma is nowhere to be seen.
I should be able to call him back, though.
He's somewhere in the history, right?
Damn it.
Live radio, boys and girls.
I guess not.
We'll take another call real quick.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, guys.
This is Footy Monster from Argentina.
Hey, Footy Monster.
What's on your mind?
We're waiting for Ranma to call back, but he never did.
So we're taking another call in the meantime.
So what's on your mind?
All right, then I'll make it fast just in case he calls back.
It's all good.

or you might have like a ball that starts going faster and faster which is second or you might need to blow into the screen to have the ball go up a little bit all the time instead of keep going down because sometimes you're like on a scrolling screen and you're always going up and if you get stuck you die and stuff like that.
It's really weird but it's actually pretty fun.
How do you control that?
With the stylus?
All with the stylus.
There's no buttons whatsoever.
Do you drag the paddle around or...?
Yeah, you drag the paddle around.
Sometimes you've got to drag just left and right.
Sometimes you can drag across the whole screen so you can actually move it up and down too.
And there's this level where you actually have to draw your own paddle.
Wow.
So you can draw it in any shape you want.
Huh.
That sounds pretty cool.
I know.
It's like a team of ten people that made it, and it's like 20 bucks or something like that.
So, I mean, I'm definitely going to try to pick it up next week when I go to Toronto.
So
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Actually, there's a little part where you're basically controlling a ship.
Instead of having just a paddle, it's a ship that shoots lasers.
So you can actually shoot lasers and destroy obstacles on the screen and stuff like that while you're bouncing the ball around.
Do you get to fight Doh?
What was that, sorry?
Do you get to fight Doh?
Yeah.
All right.
Real quickly, before we let you go, anything you're looking forward to at E3 this week?
Yeah, actually, I'm looking for everything RPG related for obvious reasons, and I'm really curious to see if Sega is going to announce anything related to Shenmue, like at all, even Shenmue Online, anything.
But it's just the hopeful in me that I know it will not happen, but I have to keep wondering about it, you know, because they robbed me from my Shenmue 3, so hey, you know.
I would say you have about as much chance of seeing Shenmue 3 as you do the public apology for Sonic.
Yeah, Shenmue 2 sort of bombed, didn't it?
The first one was really good, especially playing Space Harrier.
We probably shouldn't be getting to this because I'm such a big fanboy that I could talk for hours about the game.
Just saying that.
And one last thing.
I think next weekend there's going to be a fighting game tournament in Toronto.
Oh, fun.
In York University.
So, you know, if you are interested, it's like five bucks or ten bucks to get in.
It's like three days.
And it's going to be, you know, crazy full of people.
So I'm going to try to, since my flight arrives on Saturday, I'm going to try to go straight there.
Well, give us a call and let us know how it goes.
Shout OLR really loud.
I'll call in, you know, next Sunday.
All right.
Sounds good.
Thanks so much for the call, FootyMonster.
Take care.
Okay, you guys too.
Alright, bye-bye.
Bye.
I wanted to hear the report too from an anime vet.
SSJ100, Matt, you're suddenly my hero for saying Admiral Ackbar's cereal is greater than Night Trap 2.
We watched that right before you showed up at the 4th of July party.
We watched the Star Wars Robot Chicken show.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Boyfriend's really good friend is a physician's assistant, so we always call him for drug advice, like, what should I be taking, because I have a killer headache.
And it worked.
All right, I don't see Ranma calling back, so at least we'll go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, Rob.
Able to Think from the forums.
Here, let me mute my thing.
Hello, Able to Think.
Are you a first-time caller?
Yeah, I am.
Well, welcome to the show.
What's on your mind?
Thanks for calling.
That psycho lady from Australia who decided to try to abduct... Well, technically abduct the kid from whatever state that was.
That was kind of gross.
Yeah, what is up with that?
What do you want to say about that?
I mean, does that just not make you feel good in your tummy?
Does it make you sick?
It makes me want to go...
Grab a shotgun and hopefully... Well now wait a minute, careful what you say on an internet radio program.
You need to be shot with happy lasers.
Yes, that's right, you want to shoot with flowers and rose petals.
Bunch of flowers!
Seriously, if a lady like that came to my door, I'd probably freak.
Well, but the thing that pisses me off about it is that it gives World of Warcraft a bad name because nobody stops to think that, oh, this is just some crazy bitch.
But they go, oh, well, they met on World of Warcraft, so obviously all the crazies are on World of Warcraft.
Which is somewhat true.
There are a lot of crazies on World of Warcraft, but we're not all crazy.
What's that, buddy?
I think you mean video games in general because that seems to be whatever everybody thinks.
Whenever anything goes wrong with society, it's all video games' fault.
That's true.
That happens.
And our crazy psycho lawyer friend's name we must not mention.
That's absolutely right.
I know.
It drives us nuts.
Well, what are you looking forward to at E3 next week?
Okay.
I want to see if Nintendo announces a Wii Hard Drive.
A Wii Hard Drive?
What the hell would they use it for?
Virtual console games.
And if they have an Xbox Live service coming on, then they're going to need to get it so you can have more space or else you're not going to be able to fit all your games on there.
Or how about they use the SD memory card slot that they have on there and don't seem to use for anything.
Yeah, well...
I'm sure they'll use it for all that download content that's available on WeConnect24.
I know my flash drive is teeming with tons and tons and tons and tons of content, so much so that I don't get around to playing any of it.
Well, I mean, who knows?
You know, the Magic 8-Ball says not bloody likely on that, but who knew that Nintendo would put out a two-screen system with a touchscreen?
I mean, you know, crazier things have happened.
Yep.
Oh, I'm done, too.
I have an FU.
Is that okay if I FU something?
Really quick, sure.
FU to spin markers because they cheat.
They spin markers.
I can't spin my fingers.
So you're giving F.U.
an 0 and on 2.
What's the problem with the spin markers?
Okay, see, it's like a nice lady.
You have to get their sweet spot or else it doesn't work.
Very well put, my friend.
Very well put.
All right, we've got to let you go, though, buddy.
Thanks so much for the call, but we're going to try and get Ranma one more time here, and we'll talk to you again, okay?
See you.
All right, thanks for the call.
We like hearing from noobs.
It's always good to hear from new people.
Ah, damn it.
Just as I went to the tab that Arama's call, he dropped.
Ah.
Oh, there he is again.
Let's try it again.
One more time.
You're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
This is Ranma.
Can you hear me now?
Thank God.
Yes, we can.
We can hear you.
What's on your mind, buddy?
This better be good.
All right.
And I'll call it with my anime next con report.
And I'll tell you this right now.
For a local con, it was pretty much off the walls.
Really, that's a glowing reveal.
What happened?
What made this con so freaking great?
Well, one of the main important things about cons is it's just as good as the friends who were there.
I guess with me, when I got there, I knew like half the people there, you know, getting stopped, like, hey, how are you and stuff.
And the fact that it's like, the way that the con is laid out, you have the Expo Center, like six, seven hotels in the area, everybody's hanging out at the Hollywood front lawns.
or to hang out from the Expo Center.
Then you go on the inside, you see like a lot of video game cosplay, which was really awesome in my book.
So was there a lot of gaming content at this con?
Because the way Sakura made it sound, it wasn't too much on the gaming.
Well, I do know this much.
They basically got rid of the DDR room and replaced it with Guitar Hero.
Yeah, I guess you kind of seen that slowly happening at a lot of cons and pretty soon Rock Band, huh?
No, it's called Sprint Network
Chris Patton, Monica Rial, ADV, Funimation
and the big thing that's always is Final Fantasy which is a gig but that's starting to kind of dwindle down now you see a lot of more stuff that's coming I saw a lot of Lucky Star cosplay I still see some SMA which is still somewhat popular interesting huh very cool alright well anything else any funny funny things happen at the con you want to share with us especially funny moments
Well, I was at the bed dog, which is the staff party, and the Las Vegas rule was put in effect.
So I really can't tell you about that, but I can say this.
Most of my funny experiences is that running into people that I know, and I'm like, do I know you?
Oh, now I know who you are.
Different costume, different makeup, and it's like, ah, I see.
What happens at anime cons stays at anime cons, huh?
Definitely, especially when you're taking shots of Silco.
Well, alright, don't have too much fun over there, okay?
I don't want any luck.
I was on my way back when I was trying to call.
What?
I'm sorry?
I was on my way back from the party when I was trying to call.
Ah, well, maybe that explains some of the difficulty we had earlier.
Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling and giving us your report, okay?
No problem.
Take care.
Alright, later.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hello?
Hi, who's this?
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
This is Sinan from Finland.
Oh, wow, we love getting listeners from far away.
What's on your mind, my Finnish friend?
I don't really have all that much in mind, I think, because it's early in the morning over here.
I know you've been staying up very late to listen to us live.
Well, we appreciate it.
Well, I was off to work at the beginning, but I've been here one hour now, I think.
Oh, very cool.
Well, has there been a topic tonight that you wanted to chime in on?
No.
Not really.
While at work, I listen to the five... What the fuck is this sound I'm hearing?
It's Rob being silly.
I think you're hearing us echoing.
It's okay.
I don't think we've had someone call in just to say, hey, who's up?
It's really because I listened to the five-year anniversary show, and I thought I would just drop in a line.
After all, I got back from work, and I thought that maybe I could call in now and never again listen live.
Well, did you enjoy the five-year anniversary show?
E3 Big News
Yeah, of course, it's always better, except for now, isn't it smaller nowadays?
Well, a little bit, but it's still all the same news.
The show itself might be small, but the news, I believe, is still going to stay the same.
Is there anything that you hope will happen at this year's E3?
I hope there will be some good information about Fallout 3, because that's a game I'm very interested in.
Ah, Fallout 3, what is it about Fallout 3?
Were you a fan of the first two games, or have you just seen the screenshots, you're excited?
What is it about Fallout that you love?
I'm a huge Fallout fan, which means that Fallout 3 I'm pretty scared about.
I think it's going to be shit.
Why do you think that Fallout 3 is going to be shit?
It's going to be Oblivion with guns.
Oblivion with guns.
But Oblivion's a freaking great game.
But I guess, you know, maybe that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to translate well into a series like Fallout.
No, I don't think so.
And I don't really like Oblivion either.
You don't like Oblivion?
No, of course not.
What were you playing it on?
What system?
I haven't been playing it, that's why I don't like it.
I'm sorry, I'm thinking of a different game.
It's alright.
It's getting late over here, too.
Alright, well, anything else you wanted to share with us quickly tonight before we let you go?
Not really, I don't think so.
Alright, well, that's alright.
Thanks so much for calling.
It was certainly an entertaining call.
We appreciate it, okay?
I hope so.
All right.
Let's see if I can catch some other shows some other time.
All right.
Sounds good.
And we know you have to stay up late to listen live, so we appreciate that true fandom over there overseas on this other side of the pond.
Yeah.
Two ponds.
All right.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
It was just a hop, skip, and a jump in an 18-hour flight, right?
All right.
Take care, buddy.
Yep.
Take care.
Later.
Bye.
Later.

There's rumors going around that Rock Band may be an Xbox 360 timed exclusive game.
The reason being is because the invitation to their Rock Band E3 presentation had the Xbox 360 logo on there, but amazingly enough, the PlayStation logo was not on there.
Could it be a mistake?
I don't know.
Although I know from all the videos that we've seen from, I think, the EA event, the game was being played on an Xbox 360 dev kit.
Stuntman Ignition Atari Classics Gamefly
So in the past we've noticed that of course Gamefly has a lot of titles of stuff that have leaked like beautiful Katamari before people notice or before they have the official announcement.
Let's see what else here.
There's a rumor also going around that Mario Kart Wii may be coming out this year but in Europe.
The rumor is that
The US will be getting Smash Bros.
Brawl in 07 and Mario Kart in 08.
Whereas Europe will be getting the opposite.
Mario Kart in 07 and Smash Bros.
in 08.
What is this?
Nintendo's apology to Europe?
I don't know.
I want fucking Mario Kart.
Fuck this Smash Bros.
shit.
You can all wait for Smash Bros.
I don't want my cake and I'm going to eat it too.
I want both cakes.
I want more Mario Kart.
And then...
Battalion Wars 2 has been pushed back to October 29th.
What makes that interesting, though, is there's no Wii game coming out in September.
So if you think about it, and this is all speculation, but if you think about it, and they wanted a pretty strong Wii title to compete against Halo 3 and whatnot, that would be the perfect prime spot for Super Smash Bros.
Brawl.
All right.
We'll see what happens.
Jamie, you have anything?
Because I don't.
No.
All right.
That was a very firm no.
All right.
Then let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts because we're going to wrap up here and end the show.
Thank you so much for being here, Jonas, Explicit.
I know you didn't get a chance to say too much tonight.
No problem.
I know you came in when things were already running, but we appreciate you helping out with Listless.
Any last final thoughts for our listeners?
Well, I understand you guys wanted to go to E3.
I mean, there's always next year.
That's right.
Some other year.
That's okay.
We're having fun.
We're having fun stomping and throwing a fit this year.
It's fine.
Wait, by the way, was it FU's of the week earlier today?
I missed them.
They were early in the show.
I'm sorry to say.
I'm not angsty, so.
Oh, I was going to say you can quickly throw one out as your final thought.
Well, the only FU I had was Anime Expo 07's organization this year.
Being an owner organized and having the staff pro screwed all over for everybody else.
All right.
Especially with the scheduling.
I have not been hearing good things about what went down there.
And of course, everyone heard about the whole petition of trying to move Anime Expo 08 out of Los Angeles Convention Center.
Wow.
Yes, there's been extreme amounts of debates over it, being how it's unsafe, and how the hotels are like two blocks away from them.
I say move it back to Disneyland.
They love that.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, hell no.
That was a nightmare.
DarkSakura, your final thought?
I'm going to Disneyland, bitches.
My final thought is I want candy very badly, even though I shouldn't be eating more candy, but I really want candy.
Don't forget about Sack Enemy this week.
I won't, I won't.
Loki, your final thought?
Last but certainly not least, Loki.
I have a kitty.
Named after an Atari emulator.
