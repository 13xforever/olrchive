02:38.280 --> 02:41.400
first-time listeners tonight I was noticing some folks saying it was our

first time listening so hello to all of you first-time listeners in chat it's

02:45.040 --> 02:47.600
kind of a smaller audience in chat tonight though what I was thinking maybe

02:47.600 --> 02:51.640
part of that is that people are reading Harry Potter right now they are they

02:51.640 --> 02:54.760
should actually be done with it because it's been out for like two days so you

02:54.760 --> 03:00.720
finished an hour before I before I left the house oh my gosh so you finished the

03:00.720 --> 03:04.200
book about two hours ago so both of you finished the book yeah I finished about

03:04.200 --> 03:08.880
this afternoon sometime and I don't read the books I would have been been done

03:08.880 --> 03:14.560
last night but I had to play D&D I just wanted to get done with it because then

03:14.560 --> 03:19.080
I could go back on the internet and not get spoiled by things I know I hate all

03:19.080 --> 03:23.000
of you spoiler people yes and no spoilers in chat tonight don't even try

03:23.000 --> 03:25.720
to be funny it's not cool so please don't ruin the book for those haven't

03:25.720 --> 03:29.560
finished yet you know there's a lot to ruin I could kill I will Avada Kedavra

03:29.560 --> 03:34.240
your ass I went directly to the spoiler page as soon as I found it you know I

03:34.240 --> 03:37.560
don't know it's part of me I like to be spoiled and find out what's gonna happen

03:37.560 --> 03:40.320
I don't even really read the book so watch the movies I haven't seen the

03:40.320 --> 03:42.800
newest one in fact I didn't see the fourth one either but I like the first

03:42.800 --> 03:48.480
three movies they're cool the fifth movie sucks now Jamie did you actually

03:48.480 --> 03:51.920
go to the bookstore at midnight to buy the book no I was smart and went on

03:51.920 --> 03:56.880
Amazon oh so you had to deliver to your house yes I went to Barnes and Noble

03:56.880 --> 04:03.680
because I was also high on Vicodin I couldn't drive to the bookstore

04:03.680 --> 04:07.280
although Dan said that he went to Walmart and almost bought me one the

04:07.280 --> 04:12.480
Rob D says spoiler Jesus dies on page 681 oh you weren't looking for Bible

04:12.480 --> 04:18.520
spoilers get it I think I saw that I think I saw that same joke on dig this

04:18.520 --> 04:24.960
week failed I'm just kidding no but I went I went to Barnes and Noble at about

04:24.960 --> 04:29.880
1030 on Friday and there were already a ton of people there because I wasn't

04:29.880 --> 04:33.880
there to buy Harry Potter smelly people there was the fattest Hermione I'd ever

04:33.880 --> 04:38.160
seen in my life was there actually so but I went bought the book for stardust

04:38.160 --> 04:41.320
because I got to see a sneak preview of that movie that's coming out a couple

04:41.320 --> 04:45.240
weeks stardust and I loved it it was like a video game I had Sky Pirates like

04:45.240 --> 04:48.840
Final Fantasy 12 it was awesome and like magic and Michelle Pfeiffer was which it

04:48.840 --> 04:52.720
was great so I I wanted to get the book that it was based on and they had it at

04:52.720 --> 04:56.480
Barnes and Noble but then like I had to like go through crowds and crowds of

04:56.480 --> 05:00.840
people it was crazy why did you go on Harry Potter night because I was there I

05:00.840 --> 05:04.120
went to two Barnes and Nobles for Harry Potter night we went to eat at dos

05:04.120 --> 05:08.600
coyotes was like right next door to Barnes and Noble so we just decided to

05:08.600 --> 05:12.280
go there I was like I want to get the stardust book right now I was there too

05:12.280 --> 05:18.640
waiting with my wife for the book and I was playing Final Fantasy well that

05:18.640 --> 05:24.120
makes you a nerd too I waited in the Harry Potter line last year and I

05:24.120 --> 05:30.040
already bought my British one online and I ended up the still wasn't as bad as

05:30.040 --> 05:36.320
the Dreamcast line in 99 the Dreamcast line I sat and read books I just walked

05:36.320 --> 05:42.520
into games or EB games when James came out so did I I just was like we did the

05:42.520 --> 05:46.040
midnight thing at a GameStop I don't think Wichita is big enough for that

05:46.040 --> 05:50.120
looking in chat room uninvited says we handed out cupcakes for our book release

05:50.120 --> 05:56.880
at Walmart and this old smelly lady came up and ate like 12 one per person unless

05:56.880 --> 06:00.680
you ordered 12 books or had a little sign or something but that just kind of

06:00.680 --> 06:04.080
reminded me of the time the we came out and we were handing out you know the

06:04.080 --> 06:09.880
soda and the doughnuts and smelly people it was some were smelly but not at the

06:09.880 --> 06:16.400
target we ended up staying it was they were all well well-bathed it's too cold to be smelly cuz

06:16.400 --> 06:20.440
when it's cold you can't really smell people as badly as when it's hot like

06:20.440 --> 06:26.880
anime conventions I think that fanboy funk is worse in the summer if you let

06:26.880 --> 06:31.240
it sit out for a little while all right boy funk does not take summer vacation

06:31.240 --> 06:34.720
all right let's let's talk about video games we're like more than five minutes

06:34.720 --> 06:37.760
in the show we haven't talked about video games just been that I said Final

06:37.760 --> 06:46.600
Fantasy video games are video games too but they're not good cuz why is why

06:46.600 --> 06:49.640
isn't there a good Harry Potter game cuz they're made by you haven't made me

06:49.640 --> 06:53.000
design one that's not mean that it's a bad it should be a bad game if it's made

06:53.000 --> 06:56.840
by you know it's the fact that they take franchises and and don't care about them

06:56.840 --> 07:00.320
they're just like oh give me money on them yeah here was now here was the

07:00.320 --> 07:03.800
nerdiest thing ever though we were at claim jumper last night or whatever and

07:03.800 --> 07:07.880
we were going around the table going like what what house would you be in if

07:07.880 --> 07:12.680
you were in Harry Potter probably in sparkly poo there is no sparkly poo you

07:12.680 --> 07:17.880
have to read the fanfiction whatever anyway so we thought why isn't Harry

07:17.880 --> 07:20.640
Potter like an MMO why isn't there an MMO set in the Harry Potter universe

07:20.640 --> 07:25.200
millions of people would play it if they could be you could have like actual like

07:25.200 --> 07:29.000
Quidditch and doing quests in the Harry Potter universe why isn't there actually

07:29.000 --> 07:34.160
a game on ps2 is fun to exactly whatever it was I don't think the universe would

07:34.160 --> 07:40.440
be that big I mean it'd be Hogwarts and well I guess you could you could have a

07:40.440 --> 07:44.200
bunch of other school there are other schools so well now there's not gonna be

07:44.200 --> 07:47.520
any more books why not have you know why not have an MMO in the Harry Potter

07:47.520 --> 07:53.040
universe hmm who says it's not coming I mean look at Lord of the Rings online I

07:53.040 --> 07:59.040
did the quiz that was on the Warner Brothers site and I got Slytherin I

07:59.040 --> 08:02.200
didn't think I did the quiz I got Ravenclaw I was like what the fuck's a

08:02.200 --> 08:10.520
Ravenclaw even smarter because they're also sneaky all right let's get to

08:10.520 --> 08:13.360
actual like video game chat I will start with how was your gaming week dark

08:13.360 --> 08:19.240
soccer how is your games what games I've been high on Vicodin all week so I

08:19.240 --> 08:23.080
haven't played anything not even pinball I did well no I played World Cup soccer

08:23.080 --> 08:29.080
see there's something but I am Ally so I can't really do much gaming all right

08:29.080 --> 08:33.360
well that's all right Loki how was your gaming week I played paper Mario on the

08:33.360 --> 08:38.800
virtual console not exactly like super paper Mario a little bit disappointing

08:38.800 --> 08:45.440
but I don't know it's tolerable for right now I guess I think if I played

08:45.440 --> 08:49.240
that right after I played Super Mario RPG I would have been greatly

08:49.240 --> 08:55.280
disappointed then I played Final Fantasy I'm actually most the way through the

08:55.280 --> 09:03.000
game now what else did I do gaming related I fully disassembled a PSP and

09:03.000 --> 09:08.080
put it back together again because I was thinking I let me put this way I have

09:08.080 --> 09:13.080
charge cables for my PSP but they're at work and I want to play Final Fantasy my

09:13.080 --> 09:16.960
battery was low so I was going to make my own charge cable but then I couldn't

09:16.960 --> 09:21.440
find this my car adapter cable that was going to hack apart for the second half

09:21.440 --> 09:25.840
of it so I was like well I could just solder some stuff on to the USB port on

09:25.840 --> 09:30.320
to the PSP and just solder that to the power port and then it should be able to

09:30.320 --> 09:34.480
charge via USB so I took that all apart and got fascinated with that I'm like

09:34.480 --> 09:37.840
crap this is not going to go back together again is it so I put it back

09:37.840 --> 09:41.000
together and I think it's working now except for some reason though when I put

09:41.000 --> 09:46.240
the USB charge cable I bought today on it it wasn't lighting up so I don't know

09:46.240 --> 09:49.080
if that's just the battery that's in there that's so dead they won't charge

09:49.080 --> 09:55.640
with that or what but hopefully it works otherwise that's my you know parts PSP

09:55.640 --> 10:01.040
anyway so I gotta sell it so I can get a new one then other than that I tried

10:01.040 --> 10:07.840
playing oh I played Super Rub-a-dub on ps3 crap is that one of those new

10:07.840 --> 10:10.360
downloadable games the one with the Ducks or whatever yes it's the one the

10:10.360 --> 10:14.400
Ducks it's actually a game rap yeah it's it's stupid what do you do in the game

10:14.400 --> 10:18.280
you tilt using the six axis because that's almost every single game that's

10:18.280 --> 10:24.680
downloadable on the PSP right now or ps3 you tilt the six axis to make the Ducks

10:24.680 --> 10:29.840
go around you collect ducks and get to the drain it is crap is so fucking hard

10:29.840 --> 10:34.680
to control it's not fun luckily I didn't download the full game I download the

10:34.680 --> 10:39.720
demo so no money lost is it the Ducks from the old first PlayStation demo they

10:39.720 --> 10:44.040
had from every single demo that they've done so far ducks have been all of them

10:44.040 --> 10:49.120
she's running gag and now it's a game no the game still running gag it's crap

10:49.120 --> 10:55.640
that's what it is gk 128 in our chat room agrees with you super rub-a-dub for

10:55.640 --> 11:03.200
the lose he also gk 128 says the controlling super rub-a-dub is so bad it

11:03.200 --> 11:06.840
doesn't even follow your movements right it doesn't and it's just way too

11:06.840 --> 11:10.840
sensitive so no thanks I ended up selling a lot or I sold back

11:10.840 --> 11:15.160
Motorstorm today you know now I'm just stuck with resistance which is you know

11:15.160 --> 11:19.720
great game but I just you know my PlayStation 3 right now is being treated

11:19.720 --> 11:23.560
like my PSP except my PSP has more gaming going along with it because I

11:23.560 --> 11:29.640
don't buy games anymore for it if only they had that for the oh I thought I'm

11:29.640 --> 11:32.920
thinking about modding my weight that might be something that's coming on mod

11:32.920 --> 11:37.960
chips I can play some import games at times all right me go Todd you want to

11:37.960 --> 11:41.280
share with us your gaming week if anything I've still been trying to think

11:41.280 --> 11:46.600
if I played anything this week besides Wow and I don't think I did so I played

11:46.600 --> 11:52.240
Wow what happened in Wow well it made me sad because I decided to level up my

11:52.240 --> 11:57.680
tailoring and there's this one piece of cloth I can only make every three days

11:57.680 --> 12:02.080
in 22 hours so I'm waiting for that time limit to be up I'm just being

12:02.080 --> 12:07.840
disgruntled the whole time while I wait and that's it all right aren't you

12:07.840 --> 12:12.080
exciting I am what's up it's something in the air and not a lot of game playing

12:12.080 --> 12:19.240
this week well I do that at work so I guess that's true I could see that I got

12:19.240 --> 12:24.800
a game what'd you get I got Marvel to moon Alliance for Xbox 360 but I didn't

12:24.800 --> 12:30.560
get the gold one cuz Dan was being a cheap but and he said that I could just

12:30.560 --> 12:34.280
download Hawkeye cuz it's really a character I care about okay so instead

12:34.280 --> 12:36.800
downloading the uber thing that had everybody you can just get the one

12:36.800 --> 12:42.000
character you want yeah I haven't played it yet also play Call of Duty 3

12:42.000 --> 12:46.160
multiplayer for a little bit and there's one cool kill they had we were playing

12:46.160 --> 12:50.600
on eater dam and I was driving the Jeep across it and about to jump the little

12:50.600 --> 12:55.240
gap in the middle and then someone shot me in the head luckily for me I fell out

12:55.240 --> 13:00.400
of the Jeep of course I was dead but my Jeep went forward and went over the

13:00.400 --> 13:04.640
jump and ran them over so it was a double kill is hilarious and then of

13:04.640 --> 13:07.160
course grant up that advice series stories still playing that's still

13:07.160 --> 13:12.160
yelling at everybody nerd my gaming week I tried some of the new downloads that

13:12.160 --> 13:16.960
are available on Xbox live marketplace like Bomberman live but I only really

13:16.960 --> 13:19.880
played the demo for Bomberman about download full game so I don't really

13:19.880 --> 13:24.280
want to give a full review but it definitely already right off the bat was

13:24.280 --> 13:28.240
way better than act zero that's for sure even just the demo the free demo is

13:28.240 --> 13:32.240
better than the $60 act zero so I was pleased with that it's like 20 bucks now

13:32.240 --> 13:36.680
still $20 too much that's still $20 too much for that game but it's cool you

13:36.680 --> 13:40.280
know it's it's it's classic Bomberman so if you remember Bomberman from Super

13:40.280 --> 13:44.380
Nintendo days I did notice though that when you do buy the regular version of

13:44.380 --> 13:47.120
it you're gonna be able to customize the game to hell like you know you just

13:47.120 --> 13:51.560
customize like any type of environment you want to play in and different types

13:51.560 --> 13:54.800
of power-ups that are available and all that it's highly customizable so

13:54.800 --> 14:00.080
definitely a great tournament game I'm also played the ER kung-fu although I

14:00.080 --> 14:03.400
didn't buy the full version because I can play the full version on my computer

14:03.400 --> 14:07.200
because I have it through you know game to happen what have you I just checked

14:07.200 --> 14:10.160
out I did like I thought the new graphics are pretty cool but otherwise

14:10.160 --> 14:15.640
it's not really a game I'm very fond of from back in the day I mean like snow

14:15.640 --> 14:19.840
those ones that's like stood up against the test of time yeah you know I've I've

14:19.840 --> 14:24.720
I've I've defended time pilot and even Russian attack to an extent on this show

14:24.720 --> 14:28.520
but I just can't find my love for ER kung-fu not when there's other fighting

14:28.520 --> 14:31.600
games you know like Street Fighter 2 that are better and especially this HD

14:31.600 --> 14:35.160
remix on the way and so that I'm sure gonna be pretty awesome they need to put

14:35.160 --> 14:41.920
the grid on Xbox live pretty rad and the Rob Dean chat says a ER kung-fu is awful

14:41.920 --> 14:47.000
JV Mon says it sucks ass back in the day back in the day I preferred it to kung-fu

14:47.000 --> 14:52.080
master yeah I way perverted to kung-fu master but just now I just I can't you

14:52.080 --> 14:55.960
know like sometimes I try to I find my retro game love for the simple games but

14:55.960 --> 14:59.800
like ER kung-fu is not one of those games I can just find my love for again

14:59.800 --> 15:04.040
because I guess I never really have there's some of these games on live that

15:04.040 --> 15:08.400
they seem to forget about like you know oh yeah there's downloadable content

15:08.400 --> 15:13.480
coming later and it never does like boom boom rocket I thought there's more songs

15:13.480 --> 15:16.480
it's funny you should mention that because that's another game I got really

15:16.480 --> 15:19.480
into this week randomly like I haven't played boom boom rocket in months and

15:19.480 --> 15:23.840
then this week I was looking at my the high scores and I noticed that I'd

15:23.840 --> 15:27.360
fallen not just to second place within my own friends list but third place

15:27.360 --> 15:31.440
though my own friends list I'm like at one point I had a score in the top 100

15:31.440 --> 15:34.600
okay so I was like alright I got to play this some more and try to improve my

15:34.600 --> 15:38.160
score so I did and I'm back up to second place now within my friends and now I

15:38.160 --> 15:43.160
gotta try and get back up to first place so I'm working on it playing some more

15:43.160 --> 15:46.840
songs but yeah there's no downloadable stuff for boom and rocket at all it's

15:46.840 --> 15:50.400
kind of sad because I'm not a big fan of the tracks that come with the game I

15:50.400 --> 15:53.720
even went to GameStop today I was like I got to get me in another game because I

15:53.720 --> 16:00.400
had I had like Forza 2, Shadowrun and like Tenchu Z and Monster Madness

16:00.400 --> 16:05.280
Bell for suburbia all brand new copies that I got from work but it's like I

16:05.280 --> 16:08.200
don't want to play any of this even Forza 2 I was like well I could maybe

16:08.200 --> 16:12.120
design some cars or something like no that's no I'm not gonna get suckered

16:12.120 --> 16:16.000
into playing this just like I did Project Gotham Racing 3 although Project

16:16.000 --> 16:19.040
Gotham Racing 4 that looks pretty good too but I'm gonna get suckered in buying

16:19.040 --> 16:23.440
that and hate it and then return it back either way to get one of those game

16:23.440 --> 16:27.480
rental accounts doesn't matter I'm gonna get it probably you know Microsoft games

16:27.480 --> 16:31.680
they usually get for free all right JV Mon and Chad agrees with me by the way

16:31.680 --> 16:35.460
that the tracks that come with the game are pretty boring so you go that one I

16:35.460 --> 16:39.800
like is really good I don't know smooth operetta yes smooth operetta yeah that's

16:39.800 --> 16:43.200
a great surprise Konami hasn't done like well I guess they wouldn't want to do

16:43.200 --> 16:47.280
that because of what a downloadable DDR something yeah because they would

16:47.280 --> 16:50.840
compete with their own game so why can't they do a downloadable beat mania or

16:50.840 --> 16:53.400
something even though you know I know there's a special controller comes with

16:53.400 --> 16:56.720
it and all but you know why not do like a button friendly version I don't know I

16:56.720 --> 17:01.300
guess I'm being stupid the other game I got really into randomly this week was

17:01.300 --> 17:04.720
Carcassonne I finally went back and played the demo more fully for that and

17:04.720 --> 17:08.520
I downloaded I ended up spending the cash to get the full game of Carcassonne

17:08.520 --> 17:12.000
because I got more into it into it than I did Settlers of Catan but I'll tell

17:12.000 --> 17:16.400
you this I suck at Carcassonne I am so horrible at that game like it took me

17:16.400 --> 17:21.620
forever to get the strategy down to that game I finally beat the computer in a

17:21.620 --> 17:26.120
match but I'm like in last place I've gone from boom boom rocket a game where

17:26.120 --> 17:30.080
I'm second place amongst all my friends to Carcassonne where I'm in last place

17:30.080 --> 17:33.160
amongst all my friends because I'm just not that good at it I'm still trying to

17:33.160 --> 17:37.640
figure out the strategy to it but I'm having fun like I like the fact that

17:37.640 --> 17:40.760
it's like a board game but it kind of has its own like you know the you

17:40.760 --> 17:46.080
basically the way Carcassonne is is that you're building a puzzle every time and

17:46.080 --> 17:51.800
that puzzle involves cities and roads and monasteries and all this stuff and

17:51.800 --> 17:56.680
you draw out these cards in a random order and play them down and so you know

17:56.680 --> 17:59.920
roads have to connect to other roads cities have to connect to other cities

17:59.920 --> 18:04.400
and when you claim roads or claim cities and finish them you get a lot of points

18:04.400 --> 18:08.440
for them so it's kind of cool like I've got to play it on Xbox Live and I'm

18:08.440 --> 18:11.080
afraid to cuz I know I'll get my ass handed to me but I guess that's the only

18:11.080 --> 18:14.880
way you're gonna get better at a game like that so but I've been having fun

18:14.880 --> 18:20.720
playing it so yay Carcassonne that's it for my gaming week so we will move from

18:20.720 --> 18:25.400
our gaming weeks to some housekeeping first off we want to thank or

18:25.400 --> 18:30.640
congratulate I should say one of our longtime listeners DDR angel I don't

18:30.640 --> 18:34.680
know if you remember DDR angel I should hope not at all I should hope so she was

18:34.680 --> 18:37.480
here for the longest time she got married today so I'm gonna say

18:37.480 --> 18:42.400
congratulations congratulations miss DDR angel and her husband who by the way

18:42.400 --> 18:49.600
goes online I believe by big red pimp now she's DDR pimp lady yes now she's

18:49.600 --> 18:57.880
DDR pimp so congratulations to DDR miss DDR pimp also no show next week we're

18:57.880 --> 19:01.000
not gonna be doing any show next week there may be a best-ever something that

19:01.000 --> 19:03.800
shows up on the archives that there's time but unfortunately just due to

19:03.800 --> 19:09.080
other obligations there will be no show on July 29th so we're very sorry about

19:09.080 --> 19:15.000
that dark soccer is going to Disneyland again but I am and I'm gonna be high as

19:15.000 --> 19:18.600
a kite there too and usually we would just go ahead and do a show if one of us

19:18.600 --> 19:22.560
is gone but also we're moving this is the very last show you're gonna hear

19:22.560 --> 19:27.120
from studio number three which we've had you know a good couple of years here

19:27.120 --> 19:30.560
we've been here for about two years in this tiny little room but the show

19:30.560 --> 19:34.960
basically if you haven't caught on takes place in my spare bedroom and my

19:34.960 --> 19:39.360
apartment and in a couple weeks it will take place in the spare bedroom or maybe

19:39.360 --> 19:43.680
garage haven't figured it out yet at my new house so I'm very excited about that

19:43.680 --> 19:48.680
kind of moving on up so we will be in the new studio soon that'll be studio

19:48.680 --> 19:52.760
number four so yes the show has been a lot of places over the past five years

19:52.760 --> 20:00.680
so we're excited about that so kind of like a whore what do you mean a little

20:00.680 --> 20:05.400
bit well to use it to use a friend of mine's analogy we're like the house

20:05.400 --> 20:15.000
broom everyone's had a ride I get it all right well here's the thing also we're

20:15.000 --> 20:20.720
looking to kind of relaunch of sorts in a couple weeks like not like we're gonna

20:20.720 --> 20:25.440
totally redo the show but maybe try some new things like some new album art some

20:25.440 --> 20:29.000
new openings some new incidental sounds and stuff that play throughout the show

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
so if you are a artistic or audio editing type please shoot us an email

20:35.000 --> 20:40.840
because we'd be interested in what you can do for us in regards to it new

20:40.840 --> 20:45.880
intros and new artwork and all that good stuff so more to come in two weeks when

20:45.880 --> 20:50.520
we return with more orange lounge radio for now though let's get to the gaming

20:50.520 --> 20:55.800
news for this week and I believe Loki's gonna start us off tonight yes so this

20:55.800 --> 21:00.000
week there is a bunch of news coming out of Japan during their PlayStation

21:00.000 --> 21:05.600
premiere event in Tokyo and some interesting things coming out mostly

21:05.600 --> 21:10.720
stuff that we're not going to see over here one of which is a TV tuner for the

21:10.720 --> 21:17.040
PSP it's actually a one seg tuner device and kind of attaches to the top of via

21:17.040 --> 21:24.000
the USB port much like the GPS receiver and camera and apparently you can tune

21:24.000 --> 21:27.840
into different TV stations and one that's supposed to be coming out in

21:27.840 --> 21:32.240
September and that's kind of cool wish it we'd get something like that over

21:32.240 --> 21:40.720
here me something third-party I know why is it that we're not getting any stuff

21:40.720 --> 21:44.400
over here yes never came out over here either and I don't think the camera did

21:44.400 --> 21:50.480
either so maybe we're just not into all those things over here we I know we care

21:50.480 --> 21:53.880
about high-tech gadgets over here but not like Japan does that's why we get

21:53.880 --> 21:58.200
two colors of things sometimes three Japan gets a hundred and fifty eight

21:58.200 --> 22:03.600
versions a week but TVs are kind of cool I don't know I might make the PSP a

22:03.600 --> 22:06.480
little more lucrative it depends how much it costs how much does it cost in

22:06.480 --> 22:18.080
Japan I was 6,900 yen that's about what $69 right I'm not mistaken yeah all

22:18.080 --> 22:24.200
right oh by the way it's only compatible with the new PSP not the old one not

22:24.200 --> 22:26.800
that it really matters because in September it's gonna be replacing all

22:26.800 --> 22:31.560
the old ones anyways gee Sony likes to do that replace old stuff oh yeah like

22:31.560 --> 22:36.280
they're the only company out there that redesigns their systems Nintendo I'm

22:36.280 --> 22:41.960
looking at you all right but they make them better and in better colors speaking

22:41.960 --> 22:46.920
of better colors there are more PSP color variations coming out in Japan you

22:46.920 --> 22:49.520
know how we're getting what we're getting like three colors here two

22:49.520 --> 22:54.000
colors in a in the Star Wars okay well over there they're getting piano black

22:54.000 --> 22:59.600
ceramic white and ice silver but they're also getting the bloom series with rose

22:59.600 --> 23:06.760
pink lavender purple and Felicia blue I want that blue one so bad but this

23:06.760 --> 23:12.120
sounds like bubble bath salts colors it's so pretty this sounds like

23:12.120 --> 23:18.600
something a housewife would pour in her bathtub and say Calgon take me away PS

23:18.600 --> 23:24.000
Sony take me away have salt and bubbles because it would not make bubbles well

23:24.000 --> 23:28.160
whatever but still it sounds like baths I'm getting bath salts and bubble baths

23:28.160 --> 23:33.240
mixed up okay so that's six variants on the new PSP and they already had like at

23:33.240 --> 23:37.720
least four of the regular PSP and so I can't help but feel we're really getting

23:37.720 --> 23:42.080
shafted when Sony is doing better over here than they are in Japan well it is

23:42.080 --> 23:48.840
launching in Japan on September 29th 19,800 yen and any of those colors that

23:48.840 --> 23:53.200
you want there's also some new accessories coming out AV cable super

23:53.200 --> 23:57.920
video cable D cable component cable now that's pretty awesome there's a

23:57.920 --> 24:01.440
component cable coming out for the video out not just there is that's pretty rad

24:01.440 --> 24:07.160
they'll do 480p god now I want one just for the video out so I can play Silent

24:07.160 --> 24:12.000
Hill but not it was Silent Hill origins I can play the Akumajo Dracula

24:12.000 --> 24:17.440
compilation game that's coming out what what nothing whatever all that I can

24:17.440 --> 24:20.840
play all that crap on the TV I'm very excited playing that game for a long

24:20.840 --> 24:26.240
time already but it's sexy sexy remake but the original is better whatever it's

24:26.240 --> 24:31.200
pretty shush original has Maria's crappy singing in it well maybe one of her

24:31.200 --> 24:37.320
weapons is a song book and she kills things by going wow I think I almost

24:37.320 --> 24:40.920
died a little right that's exactly what her voice sounds like to you well

24:40.920 --> 24:52.360
anyway anyway um I'm sorry I'm all giggly today no um there is a little bit

24:52.360 --> 24:56.200
of good news for our friends in Europe the PSP will actually be out there it

24:56.200 --> 25:00.880
beginning of September and in Japan it will be there on September 20th so you

25:00.880 --> 25:05.000
guys get it first you can just go rub it in everybody's face so Europe actually

25:05.000 --> 25:09.360
gets something first for once they got stuff first before remember a few games

25:09.360 --> 25:13.080
well nami loves Europe for some reason they get a lot of the cool stuff this

25:13.080 --> 25:16.560
has nothing to do with konami no but it's Europe does get stuff first

25:16.560 --> 25:21.720
sometimes what's that wow but the the price is gonna be the same as the

25:21.720 --> 25:30.480
current ones it's a 129.99 what colors are they getting it does not say oh also

25:30.480 --> 25:35.360
and not much of a surprise since we're getting the stupid Star Wars PSP over

25:35.360 --> 25:40.000
here that Japan would get something a little bit cooler in the special Final

25:40.000 --> 25:45.600
Fantasy 7 system set which will be coming out bundled with crisis core and

25:45.600 --> 25:53.160
has some fancy Final Fantasy 7 crisis core artwork on it also it's gonna be a

25:53.160 --> 26:01.440
limited production there are only making 77,777 units you know why that is right

26:01.440 --> 26:06.160
because it's Final Fantasy 7 and it's not because 7 is the most powerful magic

26:06.160 --> 26:12.240
number is beside that actually there was in Final Fantasy 7 if you got I've only

26:12.240 --> 26:15.800
heard of this happening if you got your hit points all to seven then you did

26:15.800 --> 26:24.240
some special attack for in the game the special attack was called go outside and

26:24.240 --> 26:29.040
buy more sequels of this game when it comes out I'm gonna find it so I'm

26:29.040 --> 26:32.480
looking I'm just looking at chat room now and going back to some old comments

26:32.480 --> 26:37.480
here the Rob D says I want to see Maria and Kirby in a sing-off and the dark

26:37.480 --> 26:44.920
no cuz no dark Tatsuya wants to add jigglypuff to that no Maria sings worse

26:44.920 --> 26:50.140
than all of them let's see and chainsaw juggling said I did that once it was

26:50.140 --> 26:55.160
awesome in reference to the lucky sevens there see I knew it was in there

26:55.160 --> 26:59.880
drunami says seven seven seven HP send your character into a constant attack

26:59.880 --> 27:07.320
mode yeah it's awesome all right well even though they are getting that super

27:07.320 --> 27:14.040
cool Final Fantasy 7 slim thing PSP in Japan everybody is hopefully getting

27:14.040 --> 27:19.120
this it's an expansion to Metal Gear Solid portable ops course a lot of folks

27:19.120 --> 27:22.840
are big fans of this game on the PSP because it wasn't Metal Gear acid and it

27:22.840 --> 27:25.960
was actually more like the other Metal Gear games a lot of folks are really

27:25.960 --> 27:31.160
into this your acid though had the cool 3d thing I cool is relative and that

27:31.160 --> 27:35.800
cooler headache inducing I know if I wear that thing too long I would

27:35.800 --> 27:38.440
definitely have to take some Vicodin for the headaches I'm gonna be getting after

27:38.440 --> 27:43.480
using that too much so there you go now IGN is actually reporting from the

27:43.480 --> 27:48.080
PlayStation premiere event in Tokyo that this new portable ops game is going to

27:48.080 --> 27:52.160
have some online play and that's going to be kind of its focus there's going to

27:52.160 --> 27:57.600
be some new characters possibly an older version of snake and there's only going

27:57.600 --> 28:01.080
to be a little bit more as far as the single-player mode goes the infinity

28:01.080 --> 28:04.040
mission otherwise it's the good old-fashioned Metal Gear Solid

28:04.040 --> 28:08.520
portable ops that you're used to they do have old snake from Metal Gear Solid 4 in

28:08.520 --> 28:13.040
there he's in the trailer awesome September 20th is the day that comes out

28:13.040 --> 28:17.080
hmm I seem to remember something else is coming out that day in Japan as well

28:17.080 --> 28:20.680
there it is probably take a little bit longer for it to come out here though

28:20.680 --> 28:25.000
because you know Konami hates you and they did some little thing in the yes

28:25.000 --> 28:29.240
and they did something in the video where it's like Power Rangers for the

28:29.240 --> 28:35.080
trailer that makes me want to play it now dang it well other stuff for anyone

28:35.080 --> 28:41.040
who cares is that there is actually going to be a Metal Gear Solid online

28:41.040 --> 28:47.680
for ps3 they had a little demo of it out when they did the Metal Gear Solid 4

28:47.680 --> 28:52.760
thing so if anybody cares there you go you can all wander around with boxes

28:52.760 --> 28:58.600
over your heads I get you know and your truck can start to move could Metal

28:58.600 --> 29:04.800
Gear Solid ever be like a first-person shooter someday it was when do you

29:04.800 --> 29:10.080
remember the VR missions they came out with a first-person version of metal in

29:10.080 --> 29:14.680
Japan it did came out with the first person version of Metal Gear Solid it

29:14.680 --> 29:18.040
just kind of makes me think like with all this like online and all that stuff

29:18.040 --> 29:22.720
could this be like a new halo I don't know for a certain audience I don't know

29:22.720 --> 29:27.960
it's a little silly I would say it's more like Splinter Cell or you know

29:27.960 --> 29:32.600
recon some but I don't know I think I'd play it a lot if it was I know Metal

29:32.600 --> 29:35.360
Gear Solid is one of those series but I don't get into the Tom Clancy games as

29:35.360 --> 29:38.800
much I don't get into them I don't get into that stuff either like the old-ass

29:38.800 --> 29:42.960
Metal Gear I used to love house does I don't I don't get into those games as

29:42.960 --> 29:48.440
much although the solid I it would be kind of cool to implement that into our

29:48.440 --> 29:52.600
website the what the solid I for the you know

29:52.600 --> 29:56.880
Melger acid to that that freaking headache inducing thing the thing though

29:56.880 --> 30:03.400
but it makes it 3d so I'd be kinda neat a little silly it would be jvmon says

30:03.400 --> 30:08.160
first-person shooters suck though that's an opinion that's an opinion some of

30:08.160 --> 30:12.240
them are fun some of them do suck but some are fun I love hexen I love like

30:12.240 --> 30:16.680
quake 3 that game was badass and Duke Nukem 3d hello why do you think so many

30:16.680 --> 30:18.920
people are crazy about doing them forever

30:18.920 --> 30:24.120
blaze says correction halo sucks Gears of War is amazing see I don't know I

30:24.120 --> 30:28.240
think I could not get into Gears of War at all so I could not get into it

30:28.240 --> 30:36.320
I try crazy fun I tried so hard anyways so of course last week you know there's

30:36.320 --> 30:41.160
a whole debacle about you know the 68 system being phased out in the 88 system

30:41.160 --> 30:42.480
coming into place

30:42.480 --> 30:47.640
well there's some interesting commentary about the whole thing coming from Sony

30:47.640 --> 30:52.000
Computer Entertainment Europe's president David Reeves in fact he's

30:52.000 --> 30:56.760
actually been on record saying you know the difference between 60 and 80

30:56.760 --> 31:01.960
gigabytes is very small we're just we just feel like going up 20 gigabytes is

31:01.960 --> 31:06.200
not worth it you're gonna double it then it's worth it so basically you know

31:06.200 --> 31:09.520
obviously he's commenting on the fact that I don't think the 80 system is

31:09.520 --> 31:11.800
coming to Europe I think they're going to be doing something a little bit

31:11.800 --> 31:16.640
larger but at the same time you see oh by the way yeah you probably don't need

31:16.640 --> 31:20.760
to buy it for another extra 20 why doesn't he just admit we don't have 20

31:20.760 --> 31:25.600
gigs worth of shit for you to put on here there really is not that much stuff

31:25.600 --> 31:30.520
to download that's what I don't get I you know if I would think it now I don't

31:30.520 --> 31:34.040
know I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner and I haven't been reading up very well but

31:34.040 --> 31:37.880
does the PlayStation 3 allow you to play movies like from your computer yeah it

31:37.880 --> 31:41.880
does anything like any type of movie it's limited but you can play stuff from

31:41.880 --> 31:45.200
your computer you copy them to the PlayStation 3 drive or anything you can't

31:45.200 --> 31:48.640
download them from your networking copy him but you can download some on there

31:48.640 --> 31:54.200
like I have a rip copy of kung pao on my hard drive that can play off there but

31:54.200 --> 31:58.960
nothing officially endorsed by Sony I don't think there's any movies that you

31:58.960 --> 32:04.100
can download from Sony like let's say on my xbox 360 I can watch wmv files of a

32:04.100 --> 32:08.400
certain type over the network and watch them on my TV right yeah but on the Sony

32:08.400 --> 32:11.600
I can do that with certain other types of movies yeah why doesn't Sony just

32:11.600 --> 32:15.320
blow the door wide open on that and just leave it unlimited to what you get like

32:15.320 --> 32:19.080
put all the different codex in there to what you can watch and people would like

32:19.080 --> 32:23.120
love that and they could copy movies to their drive and everything I don't know

32:23.120 --> 32:27.720
my guy absurd I never understood why they bumped it up from 60 80 anyways

32:27.720 --> 32:33.400
because I guess unless you know a lot of games really install themselves onto the

32:33.400 --> 32:37.120
drive like I remember Ridge Racer did that and the oblivion I know does that

32:37.120 --> 32:41.640
but I haven't really I don't have that many PlayStation 3 games so I can't say

32:41.640 --> 32:45.000
if they all do that but if they did all do that then yeah that would fill up

32:45.000 --> 32:49.480
pretty quick but at the same time as far as downloadable content that's available

32:49.480 --> 32:54.880
on their PlayStation Store there's hardly anything on there I mean I check

32:54.880 --> 33:00.000
maybe once every few months and there may be one or two things more on there

33:00.000 --> 33:05.200
they're actually worth downloading Ravens Dolphin says what Sony is telling

33:05.200 --> 33:10.920
the truth for once and the Rob D says MPAA sky but the MPAA you know what they

33:10.920 --> 33:14.400
can't control what if I have a video I shoot on my digital camera that I want

33:14.400 --> 33:19.760
to watch over on the TV you know they can't control that F the MPAA you know

33:19.760 --> 33:23.080
those comments coming from our chat room chat dot orange lounge radio.com

33:23.080 --> 33:26.680
something else maybe that could be a downloadable title I don't know the

33:26.680 --> 33:30.920
early screenshots I'm seeing that this game look very simplistic it's from the

33:30.920 --> 33:37.040
creator of Katamari Dimashii Kata Takahashi you might remember he said he

33:37.040 --> 33:39.800
was taking a break to work on playgrounds remember that like he was

33:39.800 --> 33:43.500
supposedly ended konmari Dimashii to go make playgrounds well I don't know if he

33:43.500 --> 33:47.940
finished or what's going on but he is released information about a new game

33:47.940 --> 33:55.440
for the PlayStation 3 no B no B boy now no B means stretch in Japanese so in the

33:55.440 --> 33:59.760
early screenshots definitely look like this big stretching I don't know turdie

33:59.760 --> 34:04.380
caterpillar thing stretching around so there's very little information on this

34:04.380 --> 34:08.700
is right now but we do know that the creator of Katamari Dimashii is making a

34:08.700 --> 34:12.880
new game for the PlayStation 3 that's about it so that's kind of interesting

34:12.880 --> 34:17.640
because you know a lot of folks on PlayStation 3 were really sad because

34:17.640 --> 34:21.040
there has been no news about beautiful Katamari coming out to their system in

34:21.040 --> 34:25.320
fact now it looks like that whole project may have been scrapped so maybe

34:25.320 --> 34:28.920
they'll get this new project instead which could be somewhat redemption for

34:28.920 --> 34:32.560
them I don't know kind of interesting I think they're beyond redemption they

34:32.560 --> 34:38.800
deserve to burn no thinking speaking of things that deserve to burn is a Gran

34:38.800 --> 34:43.680
Turismo prologue is going to be available for Japanese PlayStation

34:43.680 --> 34:52.520
Network in October we don't get it yet it will have online multiplayer and has

34:52.520 --> 34:58.200
an undetermined price it is not free great you get to pay for a demo that's

34:58.200 --> 35:05.240
awesome I just say it's more freaking cars so whatever project Gotham is more

35:05.240 --> 35:09.680
fun why don't you release an actual game instead of all these demos that's what I

35:09.680 --> 35:15.440
think another game that's coming out to PlayStation 3 at least was announced a

35:15.440 --> 35:21.280
Disgaea 3 looks very similar to all the other Disgaea games and sadly enough the

35:21.280 --> 35:25.040
graphics also look similar to the other Disgaea games meaning that they're not

35:25.040 --> 35:30.680
that great but hey it's Disgaea it's another game hurrah yeah Disgaea was

35:30.680 --> 35:34.680
never really about the graphics though it was a hilarious voice acting in the

35:34.680 --> 35:38.920
stories and you know the game itself it was pretty awesome strategy it looks

35:38.920 --> 35:44.560
okay I mean I don't know I would think though that if they're gonna step up to

35:44.560 --> 35:48.080
PlayStation 3 they're gonna do something with the graphics make them uber sharp

35:48.080 --> 35:52.080
or you know it does look a little sharper but then again the screenshots

35:52.080 --> 35:59.680
so small I don't really know well there you go also coming for the PlayStation

35:59.680 --> 36:09.760
3 at some point someday Tekken 6 Tekken 6 is going to be coming up I'm sorry oh

36:09.760 --> 36:15.800
Tekken 6 is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and of course you know

36:15.800 --> 36:19.440
Virtua Fighter is going to have online on the Xbox 360 so it just makes sense

36:19.440 --> 36:23.600
that Virtua Fighter sucks PlayStation should have something going for it and

36:23.600 --> 36:29.920
that's going to be Tekken 6 Namco Bandai answered at PlayStation Premiere in

36:29.920 --> 36:35.600
Tokyo that they will have the online capability you know I don't think that

36:35.600 --> 36:39.520
these should really be announcements anymore I think it should always be an

36:39.520 --> 36:44.120
online game I mean this is what we Microsoft doesn't go out there and out

36:44.120 --> 36:49.480
hey this game is gonna be online most of the games are online it's not something

36:49.480 --> 36:55.360
that you really need to announce just get with it Sony or hell get with it

36:55.360 --> 36:58.680
Namco I mean you should yeah because when everything online it's not Sony's

36:58.680 --> 37:03.600
fault there was this big to-do about Soul Calibur finally going online too

37:03.600 --> 37:06.160
and everybody's just kind of like yeah the last one really should have been

37:06.160 --> 37:14.800
online right so I don't know that's like saying you know you know Tekken 6 is

37:14.800 --> 37:21.920
gonna be in high definition okay great I thought it was supposed to be since it's

37:21.920 --> 37:28.840
on you know the PlayStation 3 all right well whatever whatever it is you're into

37:28.840 --> 37:34.840
we know that Dark Sakura is into this it's her website of the week and every

37:34.840 --> 37:37.920
week Dark Sakura surfs the internet up and down and back and forth and finds a

37:37.920 --> 37:41.560
website suitable of sharing with all of you it's called Dark Sakura's website of

37:41.560 --> 37:51.160
the week and here it is my website of the week because I couldn't concentrate

37:51.160 --> 37:54.440
long enough to actually pick a real site so I picked a version of the site I

37:54.440 --> 38:03.760
picked before and it's ROFL cats calm it's more lol cats so there you go more

38:03.760 --> 38:11.600
Caturday first to spread the badly grammar spelling cat captioning fun

38:11.600 --> 38:16.960
because we've really not had any of that on this show ever not a long time this

38:16.960 --> 38:22.400
is pretty funny stuff because it has like a couple my favorites on there like

38:22.400 --> 38:28.280
like what show me one show me a funny one I'll be the judge at this site the

38:28.280 --> 38:38.880
judge jury and executioner she's looking folks the justice system or fucking

38:38.880 --> 38:45.880
screwed super cat I don't know I don't know I like going to kitten or dot-com

38:45.880 --> 38:48.960
or whatever it's called that gets me through the day sometimes what kitten

38:48.960 --> 38:54.080
war yeah cuz they put two it's like a like a rate your cat site and they put

38:54.080 --> 38:59.360
two pictures of cats of you say which one's cuter it's adorable okay one more

38:59.360 --> 39:04.400
oh now that's funny that's why I see it's a picture of Winnie the Pooh and

39:04.400 --> 39:11.560
you're saying take up please yeah that's funny all right your psych is that

39:11.560 --> 39:15.960
acceptable I will allow this site is Rob pleased with my offering I have it

39:15.960 --> 39:21.840
ceiling cat is very pleased with your offering next story please I don't get

39:21.840 --> 39:26.080
that crap anyways it's not surprising we talked a little bit about this last week

39:26.080 --> 39:32.120
there was a survey that went out to all the attendees of e3 this year kind of

39:32.120 --> 39:35.360
asking them their opinions on certain things that they're possibly going to

39:35.360 --> 39:40.520
change for next year of the following they were offering new locations

39:40.520 --> 39:48.680
including Santa Monica San Diego Laguna Beach San Francisco or LA also they were

39:48.680 --> 39:53.040
prefer our question was do you prefer to see the summit held in multiple hotel

39:53.040 --> 39:57.920
settings like it was this year or a convention center type larger facility

39:57.920 --> 40:03.560
setting I know I'll probably speak for Bobby insane larger facility convention

40:03.560 --> 40:10.200
center type setting instead of having to drive between hotels and says also

40:10.200 --> 40:14.120
they're talking about what month you like you know options included May

40:14.120 --> 40:20.120
through August and then of course if you didn't visit Barker hangar or the

40:20.120 --> 40:25.320
Fairmount Hotel why not I hope it comes to because I was stuck in traffic I

40:25.320 --> 40:29.840
wasn't invited he'll get a link to the survey so we can fill out I wasn't

40:29.840 --> 40:36.640
invited I didn't visit it because it's eight hours away too far although I did

40:36.640 --> 40:41.560
not find it interesting that you one of the choices was San Francisco and you've

40:41.560 --> 40:44.320
been begging and pleading for it to come to San Francisco's that way cuz you're

40:44.320 --> 40:49.480
lazy and you don't have to you know flyer anything you could just drive

40:49.480 --> 40:56.520
driver to LA for a convention I will I swear I'll only fly to LA ever again

40:56.520 --> 41:03.400
because I hate that drive so horrible I drive great on that drive is the most

41:03.400 --> 41:08.880
boring drive is pretty boring you probably take the five yeah five is

41:08.880 --> 41:13.000
pretty boring but 99 is not much better 99 has great truck stops on the way and

41:13.000 --> 41:16.760
you meet all kinds of colorful people it's like five is like field field field

41:16.760 --> 41:23.400
field mountain field field field smell and cow like by what was it that Marissa

41:23.400 --> 41:29.160
called it a cow shwits cow shwits the town of Kohling a beautiful stuff

41:29.160 --> 41:36.000
anyway the Rob D is saying they've never driven in Illinois have they hostile

41:36.000 --> 41:40.600
on her miss here the people in Illinois don't know how to drive at all son of

41:40.600 --> 41:46.880
dad says e-308 in Vegas for the win I would not mind e-308 in Vegas I don't

41:46.880 --> 41:53.760
think Vegas would work oh why not but it's Vegas well they just did was it the

41:53.760 --> 42:02.480
ESA thing there or EMA camera what is the video kind of their big convention

42:02.480 --> 42:09.880
in Vegas and it sucks in Vegas everything's way expensive and act deaf

42:09.880 --> 42:17.080
says e3 in Mexicali Mexico hell yeah e3 in Mexico let's have it in Tijuana that

42:17.080 --> 42:23.920
would rock I'm gonna go to Mexico this year for what world pump finals they

42:23.920 --> 42:27.360
moved it out of Korea this year and they're putting it in Mexico so I'm

42:27.360 --> 42:32.200
gonna have to you know bring soap and something to keep the dirtiness away and

42:32.200 --> 42:36.360
a water filter horrible and a water you guys are horrible I'm sure those

42:36.360 --> 42:44.760
stereotypes are not true it's always gamer day at Easter Island it's so

42:44.760 --> 42:49.440
fitting mmm blaze says e3 in Canada so Rob can get more maple cookies I like

42:49.440 --> 42:53.840
that idea e3 in Canada requires leaving nothing

42:53.840 --> 42:58.920
against Canada but they're not gonna have anything up there ever they have

42:58.920 --> 43:04.520
red PlayStations I live Canada I wouldn't to Brad I will take California

43:04.520 --> 43:10.800
drivers over Alabama drivers any day all right Florida drivers may I move on may

43:10.800 --> 43:15.240
I do a new story no no one thing you might remember we were all giddy about

43:15.240 --> 43:19.080
on this program about a year ago was the Silent Hill movie remember Silent Hill

43:19.080 --> 43:23.040
came out we were all excited because his pyramid had like right there it's not

43:23.040 --> 43:27.840
four times you know he cut the shit out of people and rip that lady's skin off

43:27.840 --> 43:32.160
it was awesome and so of course we were excited about a Silent Hill 2 coming out

43:32.160 --> 43:36.600
but now I don't know how excited this is gonna make people about Silent Hill 2

43:36.600 --> 43:41.560
because Christoph Ganz has said I'm sorry I don't have the time to do Silent

43:41.560 --> 43:47.640
Hill 2 so he's not gonna be doing this is good news to you yes why cuz I didn't

43:47.640 --> 43:50.800
think he did a great job with the first one that's all right you know what you

43:50.800 --> 43:56.240
know who's wrapping up filming on Far Cry ooh a bowl yeah god I hope he's

43:56.240 --> 44:01.320
available somebody just needs to shoot that man in the head yeah careful what

44:01.320 --> 44:04.960
you have to understand in Silent Hill now will be setting will be setting the

44:04.960 --> 44:10.760
jungle on an island so be a rave there someone needs to strap that man down and

44:10.760 --> 44:16.200
lobotomize the section of his brain that controls writing movies oh wait they

44:16.200 --> 44:20.240
already did that explains his last few movies well anyway since Christoph Ganz

44:20.240 --> 44:25.000
is not on the next film Roger Avery took a hike as well now see what's going on

44:25.000 --> 44:31.240
is that Ganz has said to a French magazine DVD Rama that the sequel was

44:31.240 --> 44:34.720
ordered by Sony but he's kind of too busy with other movies like Onimusha

44:34.720 --> 44:39.480
which he's adapting that game as well obviously um so he can't do it he said

44:39.480 --> 44:43.320
this quote if I cannot take on Silent Hill 2 myself the director who does

44:43.320 --> 44:46.900
would need to continue in the same style as the first film and then make you

44:46.900 --> 44:51.520
excited Jane one does not want that crappy did get the style right one does

44:51.520 --> 44:55.360
not want to make a Hollywood style movie and I think that it makes sense if the

44:55.360 --> 45:01.840
director of the sequel is European in the best case scenario French so there

45:01.840 --> 45:07.000
it is and Roger Avery said if I'm not gonna do Silent Hill 2 if Christoph's

45:07.000 --> 45:10.960
not gonna do it that's fine we don't need them they just go the way of the

45:10.960 --> 45:14.720
Resident Evil movies I know Resident Evil is bad because they don't really

45:14.720 --> 45:19.880
follow well anything it's kind of gone on its own tangent but it'd be cool like

45:19.880 --> 45:23.680
if Silent Hill kind of took over the world and then you have people trying to

45:23.680 --> 45:27.960
survive all these mutated evil things not everybody enjoyed the Silent Hill

45:27.960 --> 45:31.000
movie though I know a lot of people did and I liked it those well then they can

45:31.000 --> 45:35.760
just make a sequel from me exactly they should have me write it it's just it

45:35.760 --> 45:41.000
just stars pyramid head seriously they should have me where I will write it's

45:41.000 --> 45:45.080
pyramid head gone wild honestly they just need to look at the second game and

45:45.080 --> 45:49.360
then take the dialogue and then add some scenes where the action takes place and

45:49.360 --> 45:52.360
there you got you got your second movie but what I don't want it to turn into is

45:52.360 --> 45:55.700
I don't want Silent Hill Silent Hill series to turn into like the Halloween

45:55.700 --> 45:59.860
series where it's just like pyramid head kills everything you know a pyramid head

45:59.860 --> 46:04.540
at summer camp killing lovely young ladies now if they wanted to spin off

46:04.540 --> 46:10.600
series I'm all fine with that Freddy versus Jason versus pyramid head oh you

not a good game it's no really I don't like it one bit why don't you like it I

50:41.940 --> 50:45.880
just don't like the controls at all I think it's a cute game and it's

50:45.880 --> 50:51.720
definitely Ella bits ish but it's it's not fun to set the Wii's problem or is

50:51.720 --> 50:54.880
that the game's problem because I noticed a lot of it's not the Wii's

50:54.880 --> 50:59.680
problem I mean this could have been done with a 6-axis too I just don't think the

50:59.680 --> 51:04.640

51:38.840 --> 51:42.840
the PlayStation 3 shit I want to practically import that game I was

51:42.840 --> 51:46.320
awesome I love the arcade series screenshots for that and I thought that

51:46.320 --> 51:50.520
was kind of interesting it looks like it's the first game though I don't know

51:50.520 --> 51:54.240
how would you practically import it like just get the instruction book well cuz

51:54.240 --> 52:00.800
PlayStation 3 is free order with all sorts of practicality like if I'm gonna

52:00.800 --> 52:04.000
rationalize getting a PlayStation 3 that's one of the games that would

52:04.000 --> 52:06.960
actually make me want to do it because I love that I don't know if it's region

52:06.960 --> 52:12.320
free for the games though that's the only thing god damn it I'm not sure well

52:12.320 --> 52:17.000
hold well this I thought it was region free for games not from the site says no

52:17.000 --> 52:21.120
region protection well then awesome I'm gonna have to import that fuck yeah oh

52:21.120 --> 52:28.120
yeah well me too well fuck yeah twice uh-huh anyway I don't want to fuck yeah

52:28.120 --> 52:34.000
twice PlayStation 2 is getting a lot of stuff going into best hits but they're

52:34.000 --> 52:40.080
getting some new games as well I believe this is new ikki tosen shining dragon is

52:40.080 --> 52:45.480
coming out and then also the metal gear 20th anniversary collection metal gear

52:45.480 --> 52:48.400
solid 2 Metal Gear Solid 3 and another your solid collection is all coming out

52:48.400 --> 52:52.520
PlayStation our Phantasy Star Universe takes a price cut as it moves into the

52:52.520 --> 52:58.800
best series and sanyo pachinko paradise 14 oh also another another game goes

52:58.800 --> 53:05.560
into Sega ages this would be volume 30 galaxy force 2 in Japan you big fan of

53:05.560 --> 53:13.280
galaxy force no I don't know Nintendo DS is getting a lot of games as well this

53:13.280 --> 53:17.720
is a big release week for games over there a Taiko no Tatujin on the DS is

53:17.720 --> 53:23.280
coming out over there and also this is great another Hello Kitty game this one

53:23.280 --> 53:30.360
is called Hello Kitty no I shot a party Sanrio characters Zuka and DS isn't that

53:30.360 --> 53:33.720
a mouthful it's an action game but it has all your favorite Hello Kitty

53:33.720 --> 53:39.000
characters I see twin star I see kiropi but I don't see bats Maru so this game

53:39.000 --> 53:45.600
fails let's see if there's anything on the PSP real quick alexa silvara and the

53:45.600 --> 53:49.720
charm says Wangen midnight equals maximum tune to now not necessarily the

53:49.720 --> 53:53.240
box art doesn't say its maximum tune to it just calls it when again mid get

53:53.240 --> 53:56.640
midnight it's all-encompassing I don't know if it's all-encompassing or what it

53:56.640 --> 54:01.280
is I would be the ideal I would think on the PlayStation 3 also look at more

54:01.280 --> 54:04.320
information on this game with that up during the oh you looking that up right

54:04.320 --> 54:08.960
now well I was looking at it is region free so it's not that expensive either

54:08.960 --> 54:13.000
which is good I'm just like I don't know if it's all in Japanese or something

54:13.000 --> 54:17.600
because some of those games can actually be in English as well I just I don't

54:17.600 --> 54:22.240
have any careful well on the Sony PSP you finally get Grand Theft Auto Liberty

54:22.240 --> 54:25.600
City Stories in Japan Capcom is bringing that to you I always think that's

54:25.600 --> 54:29.240
interesting how that works intercontinental there how different

54:29.240 --> 54:32.720
companies can bring the games see because the other game that I would like

54:32.720 --> 54:40.160
to get also maybe would be folks all you know like folklore that's gonna be

54:40.160 --> 54:44.760
coming over here well that's all I got for Japanese releases maybe I can get

54:44.760 --> 54:49.440
well I have some European releases but only a few we have guilty your dust

54:49.440 --> 54:54.800
strikers on DS guilty your judgment on PSP and they're finally getting the

54:54.800 --> 55:02.920
pokey man's diamond and pearl which was also a print album I'm done wow I was

55:02.920 --> 55:09.320
quick there's other games listed with with uh to be announced titles but you

55:09.320 --> 55:13.800
know there's nothing really specific which I would assume that some of these

55:13.800 --> 55:19.480
would already be out I would hope like Saints Row is listed for ps3 okay here's

55:19.480 --> 55:23.320
the deal with Wangan midnight and all that is that I'm looking at Wikipedia

55:23.320 --> 55:27.680
and apparently this is actually the third game in the series so this would

55:27.680 --> 55:31.720
be like Wangan midnight maximum tune 3 it's going to be a simultaneous release

55:31.720 --> 55:38.680
in the arcade PlayStation 3 and PSP hell yeah there it is that's pretty rad sign

55:38.680 --> 55:44.440
me up that might be I might try that wouldn't it be amazing if they did that

55:44.440 --> 55:50.200
for like a good series you don't like that game I don't care about I never

55:50.200 --> 55:54.920
played it you've never played it then how can you knock it because the track

55:54.920 --> 55:58.960
is amazing that's there I can knock it for that it's got a poetry song on it

55:58.960 --> 56:05.240
why don't you know it's usual Shiro is she like getting one of the throat in it

56:05.240 --> 56:09.680
maybe I doubt it it sounds like that in every song she sings I know but I doubt

56:09.680 --> 56:16.600
it see drunami sets miklotov on fire in shed SSG 100 says lol Shane's being a

56:16.600 --> 56:26.520
dick tonight tonight that's like I'm being a jerk again it never stops and I

56:26.520 --> 56:31.400

time theater please all right in fact we give emails we're gonna get to the mail

58:02.280 --> 58:06.200
bag very shortly here and I read the avalanche of emails that came into our

58:06.200 --> 58:11.960
mailbox this week at mail bag at orange everybody but first this was a big story

58:11.960 --> 58:16.680
here Peter Moore has left Microsoft that's right Peter Moore has been

58:16.680 --> 58:20.600
become very well known lately it's kind of like the face of Microsoft and a lot

58:20.600 --> 58:24.360
of these events and of course Peter Moore came to Microsoft from Sega which

58:24.360 --> 58:28.440
drew all these comparisons about the Xbox 360 launch versus the Dreamcast

58:28.440 --> 58:33.120
launch and so on well Peter Moore is actually left to move back to the Bay

58:33.120 --> 58:37.160
Area so welcome back Peter Moore even though we're not technically in the Bay

58:37.160 --> 58:41.120
Area we're close enough Peter Moore has come back to the Bay Area to be with his

58:41.120 --> 58:47.240
family so what he's gonna do now he's going to head up EA Sports is what his

58:47.240 --> 58:52.280
new role is going to be so even though he's gone from working for a giant you

58:52.280 --> 58:55.220
know console maker to a publisher that's still nothing to blink at that's still a

58:55.220 --> 58:59.840
very important role EA makes crap loads of money and if you're wondering who is

58:59.840 --> 59:04.720
going to replace Peter Moore well it's going to be Don Matrick who comes from

59:04.720 --> 59:12.160
EA he's coming from EA there you go and will be interesting to see if this has

59:12.160 --> 59:17.600
any type of changes on Microsoft's PR but probably not probably not really

59:17.600 --> 59:23.680
gonna be the same old stuff see a son of dad says Peter Moore quit to go work at

59:23.680 --> 59:28.240
showbiz you know it's funny you know where Reggie Fils-Aime came from you

59:28.240 --> 59:31.600
know one of the places he worked before he was at Nintendo Pizza Time Theatre

59:31.600 --> 59:38.680
no Panda Express really yeah but I mean look at you know Panda Express is nasty

59:38.680 --> 59:42.760
but it's everywhere now it's insanely popular so I don't know if that was his

59:42.760 --> 59:47.520
doing or what but there you go no it was the doing it was people addicted to MSG

59:47.520 --> 59:53.080
maybe all right anyhow I'll see we mentioned the mailbags coming up so

59:53.080 --> 59:56.680

Blizzcon right there but unfortunately because of the move and everything it's

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:54.160
it's too close to the finances for me probably doesn't help also that all the

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.040
tickets sold out within like a few hours that didn't help either and I was out of

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.920
town when they went on sale otherwise I might have bought one oh well so they

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.920
had interesting to see me go to Blizzcon because I have no interest in World of

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.720
Warcraft drunami says if we hang out with Wow radio we should say hi to total

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.720
biscuit I don't know who that is but I'm sure somebody listening does so there

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:19.680
total biscuit can I read the next you may okay hey olr crew it's me necky sorry I

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.280
haven't emailed in a while but I've been really busy been loving the show

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.640
recently by the way warning this might be really long no I've got longer sorry

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.600
you don't quite meet the the longest email category I've seen longer I've seen

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:40.120
plenty longer I've seen thicker can I read please yes you perverted people

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.440
what I was talking about emails shut up boo-hoo my 360 died earlier this week

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.800
and although it's a pain in the ass Microsoft is very good at cleaning this

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.880
up I had to I had to phone twice second because I forgot my original mobile no

01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:00.280
but I was only on hold for a best ten minutes each call so things should go to

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.960
Microsoft for their good support the extended warranty shows that they are

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:08.200
taking responsibility for it so I am understanding however dot dot dot dot

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.880
dot dot the expected time I will get my Burke 360 back is over one month also

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.320
did Microsoft say they have fixed the problem with the new Xbox 360s if so I

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:23.720
intended to shell out for a new 360 instead the good point to my 360 dying

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:29.440
is that I finally have dug out my old ps2 some of the games seem unusually

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.280
unusual now and look bad graphics another thing is that the PlayStation

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.160
controller seemed tiny if using the Xbox 360 controllers alone for five to six

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.160
months dude you want to see tiny try playing with a dual analog controller

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:48.760
for the Saturn and everything will look tiny to you trust me also a note on an

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.240
email last week I fully support younger online players who are online I am now

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.960
15 I can truthfully say that I am definitely more mature than than other

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.760
even 30 year old players who use the n-word and anyway I'm not going to let

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.160
this go on really long so by necky PS this is good

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.240
gramming speller lol's I'm not well I could point them out but I'm not going

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.840
to because I'm not I'm too doped up to be a bitch tonight and PBS look for me

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.320
in the chat room I saw you there I was gonna say something hi necky you're so

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:26.140
lying you didn't look I did no I even voiced him all right and necky is one of

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:29.520
our listeners from the UK so to be in our chat room right now dude your

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.320
parents know you're up oh there was a question there but the Xbox 360 and and

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.100
having three well have they fixed the problem on Xbox 360 I believe they have

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:42.460
didn't they change the chips that were on in the Xbox 360 as part of to change

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:49.060
that problem Loki am I wrong they didn't change chips they changed the heatsinks

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:54.240
that were on the graphics chips and stuff and all the new ones um have been

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.880
are being fixed I guess so then the new system shouldn't have this problem

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.000
theoretically unless there's something else that goes wrong all right well

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:09.280
we'll see what happens so that's it for email yes right right email the Rob D

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.680
and chat confirms they changed the heatsinks so heat distribution is

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.760
different there you go I have an email you have an email yeah I got it right

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.040
