1
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:19,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, July 22nd, 2007, could the next Final Fantasy use the Wii Fit Board?

2
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:22,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft faces another lawsuit over scratched discs.

3
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:25,855
[SPEAKER_01]: And could World of Warcraft win South Park and Emmy?

4
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:34,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

5
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:36,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:43,423
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that internet radio program dedicated to video games, video gaming, and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:44,524
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a whole lot.

8
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:48,186
[SPEAKER_09]: We've tried to fit a lot into this program, but that's why we're always split up into two parts.

9
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:55,910
[SPEAKER_09]: When you listen to us on our downloadable podcast, or if you listen live on Sunday nights, you get like three and a half hours of radio, just us here.

10
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:57,231
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:58,172
[SPEAKER_09]: You might know me as Sky.

12
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:00,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:01,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

14
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:01,794
[SPEAKER_09]: And how are you?

15
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:02,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

16
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:03,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you high on drugs?

18
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:05,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

19
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:06,711
[SPEAKER_09]: But legal ones?

20
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:08,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're prescription.

21
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:12,233
[SPEAKER_09]: We wouldn't endorse doing the other kind of drugs, because that's bad, okay?

22
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:12,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Not publicly.

23
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:13,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

24
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:13,874
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

25
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:16,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

26
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:16,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

27
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:17,736
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing, Loki?

28
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:18,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

29
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:19,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Had a good week?

30
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:22,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

31
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:24,109
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com.

32
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:45,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for those that have never heard... Well, you haven't actually sat in on a full show in a long, long time.

33
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's true.

34
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:48,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're actually really loud tonight.

35
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:49,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

36
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:50,583
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of something else.

37
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:51,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm booming.

38
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:51,764
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

39
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:56,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Miklatov usually has a very quiet voice, so we have to turn up the volume all the way.

40
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:57,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

41
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:03,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, for those that haven't heard the show before, Miklatov works for Konami and does DDR stuff.

42
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:04,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

43
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all we can really say.

44
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,770
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're closing soon, right?

45
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

46
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:09,291
[SPEAKER_09]: So, are you...

47
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:10,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care if they listen.

48
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:23,830
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

49
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Migatov's here because he likes games.

50
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:26,971
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not just here to dish on.

51
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually here because I was up here for Harry Potter.

52
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:33,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I suppose it's inevitable because somebody was noticing.

53
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, chat room, by the way.

54
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:37,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Our chat room is available to chat.orangelauntrader.com.

55
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:39,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of first-time listeners tonight.

56
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:42,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I was noticing some folks saying it was their first time listening.

57
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:43,876
[SPEAKER_09]: So hello to all of you first-time listeners and chat.

58
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:50,570
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a smaller audience in chat tonight, though, and I was thinking maybe part of that is that people are reading Harry Potter right now.

59
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,450
[SPEAKER_03]: They are.

60
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,391
[SPEAKER_07]: They should actually be done with it, because it's been out for like two days.

61
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:58,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I finished an hour before I left the house.

62
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, so you finished the book.

63
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It was about two hours ago.

64
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:03,513
[SPEAKER_09]: So both of you finished the book.

65
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:05,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I finished about this afternoon sometime.

66
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:06,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't read the books.

67
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:10,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been done last night, but I had to play D&D.

68
00:03:12,924 --> 00:03:17,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to get done with it because then I could go back on the internet and not get spoiled by things.

69
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:20,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I hate all of you spoiler people.

70
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:22,568
[SPEAKER_09]: No spoilers in chat tonight.

71
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:23,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't even try to be funny.

72
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:24,108
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not cool.

73
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,209
[SPEAKER_09]: So please don't ruin the book for those who haven't finished yet.

74
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,369
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a lot to ruin.

75
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I will Avada Kedavra your ass.

76
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:34,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I went directly to the spoiler page as soon as I found it.

77
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:35,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's part of me.

78
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:37,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to be spoiled and find out what's going to happen.

79
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even really read the books.

80
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:39,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I watch the movies.

81
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen the newest one.

82
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,081
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I didn't see the fourth one either.

83
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,241
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like the first three movies.

84
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:44,302
[SPEAKER_09]: They're cool.

85
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:47,103
[SPEAKER_07]: The fifth movie sucks.

86
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:50,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Jamie, did you actually go to the bookstore at midnight to buy the book?

87
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:52,565
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was smart and went on Amazon.

88
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so you had it delivered to your house.

89
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:55,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

90
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to Barnes & Noble.

91
00:03:57,547 --> 00:04:01,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was also high on Vicodin on Friday night, too.

92
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:02,029
[SPEAKER_06]: That works.

93
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And I couldn't drive to the bookstore.

94
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Although Dan said that he went to Walmart and almost bought me one.

95
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,138
[SPEAKER_09]: TheRobD says, spoiler, Jesus dies on page 681.

96
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:12,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you weren't looking for Bible spoilers.

97
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:14,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

98
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I saw that same joke on Dig this week.

99
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,179
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

100
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:43,189
[SPEAKER_09]: And I loved it.

101
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,129
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like a video game.

102
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:45,951
[SPEAKER_09]: It had Sky Pirates, like Final Fantasy XII.

103
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:46,651
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome.

104
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:47,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And like magic.

105
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:48,532
[SPEAKER_09]: And Michelle Pfeiffer was a witch.

106
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:49,213
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

107
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,914
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to get the book that it was based on.

108
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:53,215
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had it at Barnes & Noble.

109
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:56,798
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I had to go through crowds and crowds of people.

110
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:57,858
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crazy.

111
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did you go on Harry Potter night?

112
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was at... I went to two Barnes & Nobles for Harry Potter night.

113
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:07,224
[SPEAKER_09]: We went to eat at Dos Coyotes, which was like right next door to Barnes & Noble.

114
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,806
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just decided to go there.

115
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, I want to get the Stardust book right now.

116
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:16,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I was there too, waiting with my wife for the book, and I was playing Final Fantasy.

117
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:19,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that makes you a nerd too.

118
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:25,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I waited in the Harry Potter line last year, and I had already bought my British one online.

119
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:31,726
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up, it still wasn't as bad as the Dreamcast line in 99.

120
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:34,228
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Dreamcast line I sat and read books.

121
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:39,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Uninvited says, we handed out cupcakes for our book release at Walmart and this old smelly lady came up and ate like 12.

122
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:57,965
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have said one per person, unless you ordered 12 books.

123
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Or had a little sign or something.

124
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:05,107
[SPEAKER_09]: That just kind of reminded me of the time the Wii came out and we were handing out the soda and the donuts.

125
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:06,247
[SPEAKER_07]: The smelly people.

126
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:11,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Some were smelly, but not at the Target we ended up staying at.

127
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:13,049
[SPEAKER_09]: They were all well bathed.

128
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It was too cold to be smelly.

129
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when it's cold, you can't really smell people as badly as when it's hot.

130
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Like at anime conventions.

131
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that Fanboy Funk is worse in the summer.

132
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:27,763
[SPEAKER_08]: If you let it sit out for a little while.

133
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:31,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Fanboy Funk does not take summer vacation.

134
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:33,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's talk about video games.

135
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,967
[SPEAKER_09]: We're like more than five minutes into the show.

136
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:36,268
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't even talked about video games.

137
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:38,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I said Final Fantasy.

138
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:39,550
[SPEAKER_09]: There are four video games.

139
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Harry Potters are video games too.

140
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:43,052
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're not good.

141
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:43,872
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're not.

142
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:46,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because they're made by EA.

143
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:47,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Why isn't there a good Harry Potter game?

144
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:48,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're made by EA.

145
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:50,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they haven't made me design one.

146
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,260
[SPEAKER_08]: That does not mean that it should be a bad game if it's made by EA.

147
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,885
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's the fact that they take franchises and don't care about them.

148
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:58,047
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just like, ooh, give me money.

149
00:06:58,107 --> 00:06:58,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And poop on them.

150
00:06:58,728 --> 00:06:59,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

151
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Here was the nerdiest thing ever, though.

152
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:05,878
[SPEAKER_09]: We were at Clean Jumper last night or whatever, and we were going around the table going, like, what?

153
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,861
[SPEAKER_09]: What house would you be in if you were in Harry Potter?

154
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably be in Sparkly Poo.

155
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:12,506
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no Sparkly Poo.

156
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:13,947
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to read the fan fiction.

157
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:18,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so we thought, why isn't Harry Potter like an MMO?

158
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:21,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Why isn't there an MMO set in the Harry Potter universe?

159
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:22,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Millions of people would play it.

160
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:29,643
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could have actual Quidditch and doing quests in the Harry Potter universe, why isn't there actually an MMO?

161
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:31,564
[SPEAKER_07]: That Quidditch game on PS2 is fun, too.

162
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:31,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

163
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:32,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Or GameCube or whatever it was.

164
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:34,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't think the universe would be that big.

165
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:38,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it'd be Hogwarts and... There's really only a few hundred students.

166
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess you could have a bunch of other schools.

167
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there are other schools, so it could work.

168
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:44,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now there's not going to be any more books.

169
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:47,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not have an MMO in the Harry Potter universe?

170
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:49,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm?

171
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:50,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Who says it's not coming?

172
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at Lord of the Rings Online.

173
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:52,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know.

174
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:57,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I did the quiz that was on the Warner Brothers site and I got Slytherin.

175
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I did the quiz and I got Ravenclaw.

176
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:02,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, what the fuck's a Ravenclaw?

177
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Ravenclaws are the smart people, Rob.

178
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:08,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Slytherin are even smarter because they're also sneaky.

179
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get to actual video game chat.

180
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,182
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start with, how was your gaming week?

181
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:14,322
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

182
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:14,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Games?

183
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,362
[SPEAKER_02]: What games?

184
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:17,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been high on Vicodin all week.

185
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So I haven't played anything.

186
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even pinball?

187
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,301
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I played World Cup Soccer.

188
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:24,701
[SPEAKER_09]: See, there's something.

189
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:28,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am owie, so I can't really do much gaming.

190
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:29,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well that's alright.

191
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:31,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

192
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Paper Mario on the Virtual Console.

193
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:37,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Not exactly like Super Paper Mario.

194
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:42,608
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit disappointing, but I don't know, it's tolerable for right now, I guess.

195
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:43,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

196
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:49,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if I played that right after I played Super Mario RPG I would have been greatly disappointed.

197
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:53,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I played Final Fantasy.

198
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually most of the way through the game now.

199
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:00,204
[SPEAKER_08]: What else did I do gaming related?

200
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:07,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I fully disassembled the PSP and put it back together again because I was thinking let me put it this way.

201
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:13,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I have charge cables for my PSP but they're at work and I wanted to play Final Fantasy and my battery was low

202
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:21,754
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was going to make my own charge cable, but then I couldn't find my car adapter cable that was going to hack apart for the second half of it.

203
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:31,420
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, well, I can just solder some stuff onto the USB port onto the PSP and just solder that to the power port, and then it should be able to charge via USB.

204
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,261
[SPEAKER_08]: So I took that all apart and got fascinated with that.

205
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:36,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, crap, this is not going to go back together again, is it?

206
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:43,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put it back together, and I think it's working now, except for some reason, though, when I put the USB charge cable I bought today on it,

207
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:53,283
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't lighting up, so I don't know if that's just the battery that's in there that's so dead that it won't charge with that or what, but hopefully it works.

208
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:58,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, that's my, you know, parts PSP anyway, so I gotta sell it so I can get a new one.

209
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, then other than that, I tried playing, oh, I played Super Rub-a-Dub on, uh, PS3.

210
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:03,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Crap.

211
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that one of those new downloadable games?

212
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:09,590
[SPEAKER_09]: The one with the ducks or whatever?

213
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's the one with the ducks.

214
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:11,471
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually a game?

215
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:13,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's stupid.

216
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:14,534
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you do in the game?

217
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:20,779
[SPEAKER_08]: You tilt using the six axis because that's almost every single game that's downloadable on the PSP right now, or PS3.

218
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,142
[SPEAKER_08]: You tilt the six axis to make the ducks go around.

219
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,803
[SPEAKER_08]: You collect ducks and get to the drain.

220
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:28,685
[SPEAKER_08]: It is crap.

221
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:30,506
[SPEAKER_08]: It is so fucking hard to control.

222
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:31,547
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not fun.

223
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:34,414
[SPEAKER_08]: GK128 in our chatroom agrees with you.

224
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Super rub-a-dub for the lose.

225
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:25,275
[SPEAKER_08]: GK128 says the control in Super Rub-a-Dub is so bad it doesn't even follow your movements right it doesn't and it's just way too sensitive so no thanks I ended up selling a lot or I sold back Motorstorm today now I'm just stuck with Resistance which is a great game but my Playstation 3 right now is being treated like my PSP except my PSP has more gaming going along with it because I don't have to buy games anymore for it

226
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:30,794
[SPEAKER_08]: If only they had that for the... Oh, I'm thinking about modding my Wii.

227
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:34,339
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be something that's coming on mod chips so I can play some import games.

228
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

229
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:36,723
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

230
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:40,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Miglatov, you want to share with us your gaming week, if anything?

231
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:45,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I've still been trying to think if I played anything this week besides WoW, and I don't think I did.

232
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:47,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So I played WoW.

233
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:48,249
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened in WoW?

234
00:11:48,469 --> 00:12:01,158
[SPEAKER_07]: WoW made me sad because I decided to level up my tailoring, and there's this one piece of cloth I can only make every three days in 22 hours, so I'm waiting for that time limit to be up.

235
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:03,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just being disgruntled the whole time while I wait.

236
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:06,302
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

237
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:08,270
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, aren't you exciting?

238
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

239
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:10,191
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

240
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:11,212
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something in the air.

241
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot of game playing this week.

242
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I do that at work.

243
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,975
[SPEAKER_07]: So why would I do it?

244
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:16,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's true.

245
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:17,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I could see that.

246
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:19,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a game.

247
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:20,760
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you get?

248
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:32,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I got Marvel Ultimate Alliance for Xbox 360, but I didn't get the gold one, because Dan was being a cheap butt, and he said that I could just download Hawkeye, because it's really the only character I care about.

249
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:37,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, so instead of downloading the Uber thing that had everybody, you can just get the one character you want.

250
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:38,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

251
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,386
[SPEAKER_08]: That works.

252
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:40,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it yet.

253
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:45,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I also play Call of Duty 3 multiplayer for a little bit, and there was one cool kill that I had.

254
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:47,649
[SPEAKER_08]: We were playing on Eater Dam, and I was driving the...

255
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,302
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

256
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:06,097
[SPEAKER_08]: and then, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

257
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:08,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Still playing that, still yelling at everybody.

258
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:08,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Nerd.

259
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:18,141
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week, I tried some of the new downloads that are available on Xbox Live Marketplace like Bomberman Live, but I only really played the demo for Bomberman.

260
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:21,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't download the full game, so I don't really want to give a full review, but...

261
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:25,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It definitely already right off the bat was way better than Act Zero, that's for sure.

262
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:27,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Even just the demo.

263
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:31,168
[SPEAKER_09]: The free demo is better than the $60 Act Zero, so I was pleased with that.

264
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,288
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like $20 now.

265
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:33,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Still $20 too much.

266
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,210
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still $20 too much for that game.

267
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,831
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's cool, you know.

268
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:38,972
[SPEAKER_09]: It's classic Bomberman.

269
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:46,096
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you remember Bomberman from the Super Nintendo days, I did notice, though, that when you do buy the regular version of it, you're going to be able to customize the game to hell.

270
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:50,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, you can just customize any type of environment you want to play in, and...

271
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,480
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not one of those ones that's like...

272
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:18,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I've stood up against the test of time.

273
00:14:42,691 --> 00:15:06,407
[SPEAKER_09]: JV Mon says it sucks ass back in the day back in the day I preferred it to Kung Fu Master yeah I way preferred it to Kung Fu Master but just now I just I can't you know like sometimes I try to I find my retro game love for the simple games but like Yara Kung Fu is not one of those games I can just find my love for again because I guess I never really had that much there's some of these games on live that they seem to forget about like you know

274
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,881
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

275
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:46,125
[SPEAKER_09]: and I noticed that I'd fallen not just to second place within my own friends list but third place within my own friends list and like at one point I had a score in the top 100 okay so I was like alright I gotta play this some more and try to improve my score so I did and I'm back up to second place now within my friends and now I gotta try and get back up to first place so I'm working on it playing some more songs but yeah there's no downloadable stuff for Boom and Rocket at all

276
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:50,240
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of sad, because I'm not a big fan of the tracks that come with the game.

277
00:15:50,500 --> 00:16:06,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I even went to GameStop today, and I was like, I've got to get me another game, because I had, like, Forza 2, Shadowrun, and, like, Tenchu Z, and Monster Madness Belfast Suburbia, all brand new copies that I got from work, but I was like, I don't want to play any of this.

278
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:09,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Even Forza 2, I was like, well, I could maybe design some cars or something.

279
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:14,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, no, that's, no, I'm not going to get suckered into playing this just like I did Project Gotham Racing 3.

280
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:17,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Project Gotham Racing 4, that looks pretty good too.

281
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:21,206
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm going to get suckered into buying that and hate it and then return it back.

282
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:22,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way.

283
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,487
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to get one of those game rental accounts.

284
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:25,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

285
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:28,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get it probably, you know, Microsoft games I usually get for free.

286
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:29,288
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, all right.

287
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Jvmon in chat agrees with me, by the way, that the tracks that come with the game are pretty boring.

288
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,210
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

289
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That one I like is really good.

290
00:16:36,631 --> 00:16:38,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Smooth Operetta?

291
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:39,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Smooth Operetta.

292
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:40,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a great song.

293
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:43,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised Konami hasn't done like, well, I guess they wouldn't want to do that because of...

294
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:46,027
[SPEAKER_09]: What, a downloadable DDR or something?

295
00:16:59,113 --> 00:16:59,933
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

296
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:23,981
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm like in last place.

297
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:32,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I've gone from Boom Boom Rocket, a game where I'm second place amongst all my friends, to Carcassonne where I'm in last place amongst all my friends because I'm just not that good at it.

298
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still trying to figure out the strategy to it.

299
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:35,464
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm having fun.

300
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:43,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the fact that it's like a board game, but it kind of has its own – basically the way Carcassonne is is that you're building –

301
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:45,946
[SPEAKER_09]: A puzzle every time.

302
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:51,688
[SPEAKER_09]: And that puzzle involves cities and roads and monasteries and all this stuff.

303
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,770
[SPEAKER_09]: And you draw out these cards in a random order and play them down.

304
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,232
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, roads have to connect to other roads.

305
00:17:58,572 --> 00:17:59,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Cities have to connect to other cities.

306
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:04,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you claim roads or claim cities and finish them, you get a lot of points for them.

307
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:06,556
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of cool.

308
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:10,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I've got to play it on Xbox Live, but I'm afraid to because I know I'll get my ass handed to me.

309
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:12,959
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess that's the only way you're going to get better at a game like that.

310
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:13,339
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

311
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:15,370
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've been having fun playing it.

312
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,072
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yay Carcassonne.

313
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:18,994
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for my gaming week.

314
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:23,117
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will move from our gaming weeks to some housekeeping.

315
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:29,764
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, we want to thank, or congratulate, I should say, one of our long-time listeners, DDR Angel.

316
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you remember DDR Angel.

317
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:33,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I should hope so.

318
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:33,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all!

319
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:34,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I should hope so.

320
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:35,369
[SPEAKER_09]: She was here for the longest time.

321
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:36,330
[SPEAKER_09]: She got married today.

322
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:45,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to say congratulations to Miss DDR Angel and her husband who, by the way, goes online, I believe, by Big Red Pimp.

323
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So now she's DDR Pimp Lady?

324
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, now she's DDR Pimp.

325
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,361
[SPEAKER_09]: So congratulations to Miss DDR Pimp.

326
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:57,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, no show next week.

327
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,378
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be doing any show next week.

328
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:02,399
[SPEAKER_09]: There may be a best of or something that shows up on the archives if there's time.

329
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:08,001
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, just due to other obligations, there will be no show on July 29th.

330
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:09,461
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're very sorry about that.

331
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:12,482
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura is going to Disneyland again.

332
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:15,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I am, and I'm going to be high as a kite there too.

333
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:19,064
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually we would just go ahead and do a show if one of us is gone.

334
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:21,064
[SPEAKER_09]: But also, we're moving.

335
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:23,605
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the very last show you're going to hear from studio number three.

336
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:27,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Which we've had, you know, a good couple of years here.

337
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,254
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been here for about two years in this tiny little room.

338
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:35,456
[SPEAKER_09]: But the show, basically, if you haven't caught on, takes place in my spare bedroom at my apartment.

339
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:42,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And in a couple weeks it will take place in the spare bedroom or maybe garage, haven't figured it out yet, at my new house.

340
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very excited about that.

341
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of moving on up.

342
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be in the new studio soon.

343
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,200
[SPEAKER_09]: That will be studio number four.

344
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:52,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, the show has been a lot of places over the past five years.

345
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:53,882
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're excited about that.

346
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:55,705
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like a horror.

347
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:57,087
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean?

348
00:19:57,107 --> 00:19:58,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it gets around a lot.

349
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:00,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a little bit.

350
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:05,938
[SPEAKER_06]: To use a friend of mine's analogy, we're like the house broom.

351
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's had a ride.

352
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:10,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I get it.

353
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:13,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well here's the thing.

354
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:19,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we're looking to kind of relaunch of sorts in a couple weeks.

355
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:29,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Not like we're going to totally redo the show, but maybe try out some new things like some new album art, some new openings, some new incidental sounds and stuff that play throughout the show.

356
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:39,035
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you are an artistic or audio editing type, please shoot us an email because we'd be interested in what you can do for us in regards to...

357
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:43,935
[SPEAKER_09]: New intros and new artwork and all that good stuff.

358
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:48,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So more to come in two weeks when we return with more Orange Lounge Radio.

359
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,262
[SPEAKER_09]: For now though, let's get to the gaming news for this week.

360
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:53,844
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe Loki's going to start us off tonight.

361
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:54,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

362
00:20:55,366 --> 00:21:02,112
[SPEAKER_08]: So this week there is a bunch of news coming out of Japan during their PlayStation Premiere event in Tokyo.

363
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:02,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

364
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:07,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Some interesting things coming out, mostly stuff that we're not going to see over here.

365
00:21:08,054 --> 00:21:11,397
[SPEAKER_08]: One of which is a TV tuner for the PSP.

366
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:21,505
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually a one-seg tuner device, and kind of attaches to the top via the USB port, much like the GPS receiver and camera.

367
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:26,849
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently you can tune into different TV stations and whatnot.

368
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,511
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be coming out in September.

369
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:30,773
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of cool.

370
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:32,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish we'd get something like that over here.

371
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Me something third party.

372
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, why is it that we're not getting any of that kind of stuff over here?

373
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:48,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the GPS never came out over here either, and I don't think the camera did either, so maybe we're just not into all those extra purpose.

374
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:49,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would use it over here?

375
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:53,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we care about high-tech gadgets over here, but not like Japan does.

376
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:57,535
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we get two colors of things, sometimes three, and Japan gets 158 versions a week.

377
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:01,767
[SPEAKER_09]: But TVs are kind of cool.

378
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:02,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

379
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I might make the PSP a little more lucrative.

380
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:05,590
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on how much it costs.

381
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,791
[SPEAKER_09]: How much does it cost in Japan?

382
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:11,074
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 6,900 yen.

383
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:13,136
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about, what, $69, right?

384
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:14,677
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm not mistaken.

385
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:15,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

386
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:17,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Roughly around there.

387
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

388
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:22,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, by the way, it's only compatible with the new PSP.

389
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:23,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the old one.

390
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:27,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that it really matters because in September it's going to be replacing all the old ones anyways.

391
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:29,625
[SPEAKER_08]: G, Sony likes to do that.

392
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:30,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Replace old stuff.

393
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:34,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, like, they're the only company out there that redesigns their systems.

394
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:36,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo, I'm looking at you.

395
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:38,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

396
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,917
[SPEAKER_07]: But they make them better, and in better colors.

397
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:46,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of better colors, there are more PSP color variations coming out in Japan.

398
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:47,678
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how we're getting what?

399
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,118
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting like three colors here?

400
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:51,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Two colors in the Star Wars.

401
00:22:51,439 --> 00:23:03,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well over there they're getting Piano Black, Ceramic White, and Ice Silver, but they're also getting the Bloom series with Rose Pink, Lavender Purple, and Felicia Blue.

402
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:05,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I want that blue one so bad.

403
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:08,804
[SPEAKER_09]: But this sounds like Bubble Bath Salts.

404
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,250
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so pretty.

405
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:18,252
[SPEAKER_09]: This sounds like something a housewife would pour in her bathtub and say, Calgon, take me away.

406
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:20,032
[SPEAKER_09]: PS, Sony, take me away.

407
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:23,113
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't have salt in bubbles because it would not make bubbles.

408
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:24,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, whatever.

409
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:28,714
[SPEAKER_09]: But still, I'm getting bath salts and bubble baths mixed up.

410
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:29,254
Okay.

411
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:35,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's six variants on the new PSP, and they already had at least four of the regular PSP variants.

412
00:23:36,189 --> 00:23:40,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I can't help but feel we're really getting shafted when Sony is doing better over here than they are in Japan.

413
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:45,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it is launching in Japan on September 29th at 19,800 yen.

414
00:23:45,812 --> 00:23:49,313
[SPEAKER_09]: And any of those colors that you want.

415
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:51,514
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also some new accessories coming out.

416
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:56,315
[SPEAKER_09]: AV cable, super video cable, D cable, component cable.

417
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's pretty awesome.

418
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,796
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a component cable coming out for the video out.

419
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:00,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there is.

420
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:01,497
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty rad.

421
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:02,937
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll do 480p.

422
00:24:03,598 --> 00:24:04,598
[SPEAKER_09]: God, now I want one.

423
00:24:05,273 --> 00:24:09,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for the video out so I can play Silent Hill Origins.

424
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:13,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I can play the Akumajo Dracula compilation game that's coming out.

425
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:15,320
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

426
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

427
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:16,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

428
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:18,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I can play all that crap on the TV.

429
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:19,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very excited.

430
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing that game for a long time already.

431
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:23,465
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's sexy, sexy remake.

432
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,386
[SPEAKER_06]: But the original's better.

433
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:26,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

434
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:26,647
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty.

435
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:27,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Shush.

436
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,329
[SPEAKER_06]: The original has Maria's crappy singing in it.

437
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:31,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe the remake will have Maria's crappy singing.

438
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,551
[SPEAKER_06]: One of her weapons is a songbook.

439
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:59,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And she kills things by going la la la la la la Like that Wow, I think I almost died a little right then That's exactly what her voice sounds like too Well, anyway Don't do that Anyway Anyway I'm sorry I'm all giggly today No, there is a little bit of good news for our friends in Europe The PSP will actually be out there at the beginning of September And in Japan it will be there on September 20th So

00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,415
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just go rub it in everybody's face.

442
00:25:04,075 --> 00:25:06,235
[SPEAKER_09]: So Europe actually gets something first for once.

443
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:08,856
[SPEAKER_06]: They got stuff first before, remember?

444
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:09,516
[SPEAKER_03]: A few games.

445
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but... Konami loves Europe for some reason.

446
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:12,957
[SPEAKER_07]: They get a lot of the cool stuff.

447
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:14,317
[SPEAKER_07]: This has nothing to do with Konami.

448
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:17,198
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but it's... Europe does get stuff first sometimes.

449
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:18,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Once in a while.

450
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:25,199
[SPEAKER_06]: But the price is going to be the same as the current one, so it's $129.99.

451
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,720
[SPEAKER_07]: What colors are they getting?

452
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,080
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not say.

453
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

454
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:51,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, and not much of a surprise since we're getting the stupid Star Wars PSP over here, that Japan would get something a little bit cooler in the special Final Fantasy VII system set, which will be coming out bundled with Crisis Core and has some fancy Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core artwork on it.

455
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, it's going to be a limited production.

456
00:25:54,238 --> 00:25:56,018
[SPEAKER_08]: They're only making 77,777 units.

457
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:01,528
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why that is, right?

458
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:06,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's Final Fantasy VII, and it's not because VII is the most powerful magic number.

459
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,031
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beside that, actually.

460
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:19,218
[SPEAKER_06]: In Final Fantasy VII, I've only heard of this happening, if you got your hit points all to VII, then you did some special attack in the game.

461
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:22,120
[SPEAKER_08]: The special attack was called, Go Outside!

462
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And to buy more sequels of this game when it comes out.

463
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:27,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna find it.

464
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:32,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just looking at chat room now and going back to some old comments here.

465
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,228
[SPEAKER_09]: TheRobD says, I want to see Maria and Kirby in a sing-off.

466
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:39,491
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because... No.

467
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:41,792
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya wants to add Jigglypuff to that.

468
00:26:42,573 --> 00:26:42,833
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

469
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:43,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Jigglypuff.

470
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:45,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Maria sings worse than all of them.

471
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:47,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

472
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:49,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And ChainsawJuggling said, I did that once.

473
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:50,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome.

474
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:53,301
[SPEAKER_09]: In reference to the Lucky Sevens there.

475
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,962
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I knew it was in there.

476
00:26:55,757 --> 00:27:00,167
[SPEAKER_09]: DrewNami says, 777HP, send your character into a constant attack mode.

477
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:02,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's awesome.

478
00:27:03,715 --> 00:27:03,976
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

479
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:14,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, even though they are getting that super cool Final Fantasy VII slim thing PSP in Japan, everybody is hopefully getting this.

480
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:17,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an expansion to Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.

481
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:26,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, a lot of folks are big fans of this game on the PSP because it wasn't Metal Gear Acid, and it was actually more like the other Metal Gear games, so a lot of folks are really into this.

482
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:28,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Gear Acid, though, had the cool 3D thing.

483
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:31,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool is relative in that game.

484
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool or headache in Duceen.

485
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:33,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

486
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:39,249
[SPEAKER_09]: If I wear that thing too long, I would definitely have to take some Vicodin for the headaches I'm going to be getting after using that too much.

487
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:40,229
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

488
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:51,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, IGN is actually reporting from the PlayStation Premiere event in Tokyo that this new portable ops game is going to have some online play, and that's going to be kind of its focus.

489
00:27:51,831 --> 00:28:01,593
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be some new characters, possibly an older version of Snake, and there's only going to be a little bit more as far as the single-player mode goes, the Infinity Mission version.

490
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, it's the good old-fashioned Metal Gear Solid portable ops that you're used to.

491
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:08,697
[SPEAKER_08]: They do have Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid 4 in there.

492
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:09,758
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in the trailer.

493
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:10,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

494
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:13,120
[SPEAKER_09]: September 20th is the day that comes out.

495
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

496
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:16,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to remember something else is coming out that day in Japan as well.

497
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:18,363
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.

498
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:23,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably take a little bit longer for it to come out here, though, because, you know, Konami hates you.

499
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:29,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did some little thing in the video where it's like Power Rangers for the trailer.

500
00:28:30,736 --> 00:28:32,237
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me want to play it now.

501
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:32,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang it.

502
00:28:34,238 --> 00:28:43,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Other stuff for anyone who cares is that there is actually going to be Metal Gear Solid Online for PS3.

503
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:48,025
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a little demo of it out when they did the Metal Gear Solid 4 thing.

504
00:28:48,905 --> 00:28:50,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anybody cares, there you go.

505
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:55,989
[SPEAKER_06]: You can all wander around with boxes over your heads and your truck can start to move.

506
00:28:58,246 --> 00:29:01,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Could Metal Gear Solid ever be a first-person shooter someday?

507
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:02,469
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.

508
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:03,450
[SPEAKER_09]: When?

509
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:09,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember the VR missions?

510
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:10,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

511
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:14,038
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out with a first-person version of Metal Gear Solid.

512
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:22,264
[SPEAKER_09]: It just kind of makes me think, with all this online and all that stuff, could this be like a new Halo for a certain audience?

513
00:29:22,424 --> 00:29:22,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

514
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:23,925
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little silly.

515
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:29,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say it's more like Splinter Cell or, you know, Ghost Recon, something Tom Clancy-ish.

516
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:35,511
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know, I think I'd play it a lot if it was, I don't know, Metal Gear Solid is one of those series, but I don't get into the Tom Clancy games as much.

517
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:36,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get into the Metal Gear games.

518
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:37,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get into that stuff either.

519
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:39,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the old-ass Metal Gear I used to love.

520
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:40,874
[SPEAKER_09]: My spouse does.

521
00:29:41,735 --> 00:29:43,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get into those games as much.

522
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:49,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, the Solid Eye, it would be kind of cool to implement that into our website.

523
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:50,520
[SPEAKER_08]: The what?

524
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,521
[SPEAKER_08]: The Solid Eye for the, you know, Metal Gear Acid 2.

525
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:54,202
[SPEAKER_08]: That, that,

526
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:55,939
[SPEAKER_08]: HALO SUCKS GEARS OF WAR IS AMAZING

527
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,541
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

528
00:30:42,816 --> 00:30:50,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's some interesting commentary about the whole thing coming from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's president, David Reeves.

529
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:58,219
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, he's actually been on record saying, you know, the difference between 60 and 80 gigabytes is very small.

530
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,559
[SPEAKER_08]: We just feel like going up 20 gigabytes is not worth it.

531
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,840
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to double it, then it's worth it.

532
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, obviously he's commenting on the fact that I don't think the 80 gig system is coming to Europe.

533
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're going to be doing something a little bit larger.

534
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:18,566
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time he's saying, oh by the way, yeah, you probably don't need to buy it for another extra 20 gigs.

535
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:22,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Why doesn't he just admit, we don't have 20 gigs worth of shit for you to put on here?

536
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,073
[SPEAKER_09]: There really is not that much stuff to download.

537
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:27,154
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I don't get.

538
00:31:28,778 --> 00:31:36,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think, now I don't know, I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner and I haven't been reading out very well, but does the PlayStation 3 allow you to play movies from your computer?

539
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

540
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:38,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything?

541
00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:39,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Like any type of movie?

542
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:42,326
[SPEAKER_08]: It's limited, but you can play stuff from your computer.

543
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:44,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you copy them to the PlayStation 3 drive or anything?

544
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:48,630
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't download them from your network and copy them, but you can download some on there.

545
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I have a ripped copy of Kung Pao on my hard drive that I can play off there.

546
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:55,975
[SPEAKER_09]: But nothing officially endorsed by Sony, right?

547
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:59,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there's any movies that you can download from Sony.

548
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:07,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, let's say on my Xbox 360, I can watch WMV files of a certain type over the network and watch them on my TV, right?

549
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:07,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

550
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:10,103
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the Sony, I can do that with certain other types of movies?

551
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:10,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

552
00:32:10,783 --> 00:32:22,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Why doesn't Sony just blow the door wide open on that and just leave it unlimited to what you can, like, put all the different codecs in there to what you can watch, and people would, like, love that, and they could copy movies to their drive and everything.

553
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:24,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, am I being absurd?

554
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:45,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I never understood why they bumped it up from 60 to 80 anyways, because I guess unless a lot of games really install themselves onto the drive, like I remember Ridge Racer did that, and Oblivion I know does that, but I don't have that many PlayStation 3 games, so I can't say if they all do that, but if they did all do that, then yeah, that would fill up pretty quick, but

555
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Raven's Dolphin says, What?

556
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:49,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony is telling the truth for once.

557
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:50,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And theRobD says, MPAA, Sky.

558
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:11,583
[SPEAKER_09]: But the MPAA, you know what, they can't control.

559
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:15,708
[SPEAKER_09]: What if I have a video I shoot on my digital camera that I want to watch over on the TV?

560
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,329
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they can't control that.

561
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,571
[SPEAKER_09]: F the MPAA.

562
00:33:19,612 --> 00:33:22,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, those comments coming from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

563
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:26,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Something else maybe that could be a downloadable title.

564
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:26,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

565
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:29,831
[SPEAKER_09]: The early screenshots I'm seeing of this game look very simplistic.

566
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,613
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from the creator of Katamari Dimashii, Keita Takahashi.

567
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:38,856
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember he said he was taking a break to work on Playgrounds.

568
00:33:38,996 --> 00:33:39,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

569
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he supposedly ended Katamari Dimashii to go make Playgrounds.

570
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:50,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know if he finished or what's going on, but he has released information about a new game for the PlayStation 3, Nobi Nobi Boy.

571
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:53,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, nobi means stretch in Japanese.

572
00:33:54,165 --> 00:34:02,490
[SPEAKER_09]: So, in the early screenshots, definitely looked like this big stretching, I don't know, turdy caterpillar thing stretching around.

573
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:09,634
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there's very little information on this right now, but we do know that the creator of Katamari no Washi is making a new game for the PlayStation 3.

574
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:11,035
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about it.

575
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:20,879
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of interesting because a lot of folks on PlayStation 3 were really sad because there has been no news about Beautiful Katamari coming out to their system.

576
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:24,162
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, now it looks like that whole project may have been scrapped.

577
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:29,065
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe they'll get this new project instead, which could be somewhat redemption for them.

578
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:29,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

579
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:30,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of interesting.

580
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:32,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're beyond redemption.

581
00:34:32,448 --> 00:34:33,449
[SPEAKER_06]: They deserve to burn.

582
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:34,316
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

583
00:34:35,897 --> 00:34:45,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of things that deserve to burn, Gran Turismo Prologue is going to be available for Japanese PlayStation Network in October.

584
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:46,944
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't get it yet.

585
00:34:49,305 --> 00:34:53,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It will have online multiplayer and has an undetermined price.

586
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:55,909
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not free.

587
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

588
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,010
[SPEAKER_08]: You get to pay for a demo.

589
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:58,651
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

590
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:03,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I just say it's more freaking cars, so whatever.

591
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:05,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Gotham is more fun.

592
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:08,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you release an actual game instead of all these demos?

593
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:09,954
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I think.

594
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:25,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Another game that's coming out to PlayStation 3, or at least was announced, Disgaea 3 looks very similar to all the other Disgaea games, and sadly enough, the graphics also look similar to the other Disgaea games, meaning that they're not that great.

595
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:27,463
[SPEAKER_08]: But, hey, it's Disgaea.

596
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:28,523
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another game.

597
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:29,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Hurrah.

598
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:31,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Disgaea was never really about the graphics, though.

599
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:36,826
[SPEAKER_09]: It was about the hilarious voice acting and the stories and, you know, the game itself.

600
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:38,607
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a pretty awesome strategy game.

601
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:39,527
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks okay.

602
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:41,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.

603
00:35:42,468 --> 00:35:48,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think, though, that if they're going to step up to PlayStation 3, they're going to do something with the graphics, make them uber sharp or, you know.

604
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:54,052
[SPEAKER_08]: It does look a little sharper, but then again, the screenshot's so small, I don't really know.

605
00:35:55,973 --> 00:35:56,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.

606
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:02,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming for the PlayStation 3 at some point, someday, Tekken 6.

607
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:04,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Tekken 6 is going to be coming out.

608
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

609
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say it in the mic, though.

610
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

611
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:13,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Tekken 6 is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3.

612
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:19,673
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, Virtua Fighter is going to have online on the Xbox 360, so it just makes sense.

613
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:21,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Virtua Fighter sucks.

614
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:23,456
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation should have something going for it.

615
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,177
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to be Tekken 6.

616
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:34,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Namco Bandai answered at PlayStation Premiere in Tokyo that they will have an online capability.

617
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:37,336
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't think that these should really be announcements anymore.

618
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:40,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it should always be an online game.

619
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:46,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is what we... Microsoft doesn't go out there and announce, hey, this game's going to be online.

620
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the games are online.

621
00:36:48,886 --> 00:36:51,488
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not something that you really need to announce.

622
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:53,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Just get with it, Sony.

623
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:55,866
[SPEAKER_08]: or hell, get with it, Namco.

624
00:36:55,886 --> 00:36:58,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you should... Yeah, because... Putting everything online.

625
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:58,968
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Sony's fault.

626
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:06,612
[SPEAKER_09]: There was this big to-do about Soul Calibur finally going online too and everybody's just kind of like, yeah, the last one really should have been online.

627
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:08,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

628
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:10,114
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

629
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:15,977
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like saying, you know, you know, oh, Tekken 6 is going to be in high definition.

630
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:17,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

631
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:19,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

632
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was supposed to be since it's on, you know...

633
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:23,911
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

634
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:58,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So I picked a version of a site I picked before, and it's ROFLcats.com.

635
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:02,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more LOLcats, so there you go.

636
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:11,712
[SPEAKER_06]: More Caturday to spread the badly grammar, spelling, cat captioning fun.

637
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:14,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we've really not had any of that on this show ever.

638
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:15,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in a long time.

639
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:20,476
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some pretty funny stuff, because it has a couple of my favorites on here.

640
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:21,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Like...

641
00:38:23,288 --> 00:38:24,569
[SPEAKER_09]: The Justice System or Fucking Screwed SuperCat

642
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:41,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

643
00:38:41,794 --> 00:38:42,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

644
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:46,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I like going to KittenWar.com or whatever it's called.

645
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,377
[SPEAKER_07]: That gets me through the day sometimes.

646
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:49,377
[SPEAKER_07]: KittenWar?

647
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:56,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because it's like a rate your cat site and they put two pictures of cats up and you say which one's cuter.

648
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,121
[SPEAKER_07]: It's adorable.

649
00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:58,921
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like fun.

650
00:38:58,981 --> 00:38:59,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, one more.

651
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:02,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, now that's funny.

652
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:02,743
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.

653
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:06,265
[SPEAKER_09]: See, it's a picture of Winnie the Pooh and he's saying, Tigger, please.

654
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:07,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

655
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:08,806
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.

656
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:09,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

657
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:10,247
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

658
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:12,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Your psych is then acceptable.

659
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:13,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I will allow the psych.

660
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:15,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Rob pleased with my offering?

661
00:39:15,629 --> 00:39:18,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a... Sealing Cat is very pleased with your offering.

662
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Next story, please.

663
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:22,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get that crap.

664
00:39:22,891 --> 00:39:24,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, it's not surprising.

665
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:25,892
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked a little bit about this last week.

666
00:39:26,913 --> 00:39:36,216
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a survey that went out to all the attendees of E3 this year, kind of asking them their opinions on certain things that they're possibly going to change for next year.

667
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:58,256
[SPEAKER_08]: of the following they were offering new locations including Santa Monica, San Diego, Laguna Beach, San Francisco or LA also they were prefer our question was do you prefer to see the summit held in multiple hotel settings like it was this year or a convention center type larger facility setting

668
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:07,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'll probably speak for Bobby in saying larger facility convention center type setting instead of having to drive between hotels.

669
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:14,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And it says also they're talking about what month you'd like, you know, options included May through August.

670
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:21,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, if you didn't visit Barker Hanger or the Fairmont Hotel, why not?

671
00:40:22,844 --> 00:40:23,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it comes to San Francisco.

672
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:25,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was stuck in traffic.

673
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:26,765
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't invited.

674
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:27,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

675
00:40:27,443 --> 00:40:28,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never flown to LA for a convention.

676
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:58,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear I'll only fly to LA ever again because I hate that drive.

677
00:40:58,933 --> 00:40:59,634
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so horrible.

678
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:01,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I drive great on that drive.

679
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,598
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the most boring drive.

680
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:06,080
[SPEAKER_09]: It is pretty boring.

681
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,840
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably take the 5.

682
00:41:08,294 --> 00:41:10,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, 5 is pretty boring, but 99 is not much better.

683
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:14,338
[SPEAKER_06]: 99 has great truck stops on the way and you meet all kinds of colorful people.

684
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:19,021
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 5 is like field, field, field, field, mountain, field, field, field.

685
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:19,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Pooh smell.

686
00:41:20,162 --> 00:41:20,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And cow.

687
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:20,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Cow.

688
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:23,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you do it by, what was it that Marissa called it?

689
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:25,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Cowschwitz.

690
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:25,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Cowschwitz.

691
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:28,207
[SPEAKER_09]: The town of Koalinga.

692
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:29,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful stuff.

693
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:29,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

694
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:35,387
[SPEAKER_09]: TheRobD is saying, they've never driven in Illinois, have they?

695
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:36,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Hostile1 or Misty.

696
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:38,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear that people in Illinois don't know how to drive at all.

697
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:43,754
[SPEAKER_09]: SonofDad says, E308 in Vegas for the win.

698
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,477
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not mind E308 in Vegas.

699
00:41:46,497 --> 00:41:47,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think Vegas would work.

700
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:48,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

701
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:49,459
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's Vegas.

702
00:41:50,360 --> 00:42:01,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they just did, was it the ESA thing there, or EMA, I can't remember what it is, the video kind of, their big

703
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:09,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says E3 in Mexicali, Mexico Hell yeah, E3 in Mexico Let's have it in Tijuana, that would rock

704
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:20,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go to Mexico this year.

705
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:21,579
[SPEAKER_07]: For what?

706
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,600
[SPEAKER_07]: World Pump Finals.

707
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,582
[SPEAKER_07]: They moved it out of Korea this year and they're putting it in Mexico.

708
00:42:26,702 --> 00:42:32,005
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to have to bring soap and something to keep the dirtiness away.

709
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And a water filter.

710
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:34,726
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are horrible!

711
00:42:35,947 --> 00:42:38,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure those stereotypes are not true at all.

712
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:42,170
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have Konami's Gamer Day at Easter Island.

713
00:42:44,491 --> 00:42:45,272
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so fitting.

714
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:49,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Blaze says E3 in Canada so Rob can get more maple cookies.

715
00:42:49,225 --> 00:42:49,866
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that idea.

716
00:42:51,107 --> 00:42:51,647
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 in Canada.

717
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,309
[SPEAKER_06]: That requires leaving.

718
00:42:53,629 --> 00:42:56,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing against Canada, but they're not going to have anything up there ever.

719
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:00,175
[SPEAKER_07]: They have red PlayStations.

720
00:43:00,295 --> 00:43:02,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Canada, but I wouldn't.

721
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:06,721
[SPEAKER_06]: To Brad, I will take California drivers over Alabama drivers any day.

722
00:43:08,103 --> 00:43:09,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And Florida drivers.

723
00:43:09,324 --> 00:43:09,984
[SPEAKER_09]: May I move on?

724
00:43:10,765 --> 00:43:11,706
[SPEAKER_09]: May I do a new story now?

725
00:43:12,475 --> 00:43:12,815
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

726
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:18,040
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing you might remember we were all giddy about on this program about a year ago was the Silent Hill movie.

727
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember Silent Hill came out.

728
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:22,704
[SPEAKER_09]: We were all excited because it was Pyramid Head, like right there.

729
00:43:22,724 --> 00:43:23,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it four times.

730
00:43:25,796 --> 00:43:26,576
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

731
00:43:55,445 --> 00:44:07,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh god, I hope he's available Somebody just needs to shoot that man in the head You have to understand that Silent Hill now will be set in the jungle on an island There'll be a rave there

732
00:44:08,141 --> 00:44:15,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone needs to strap that man down and lobotomize the section of his brain that controls writing movies.

733
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:16,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, they already did.

734
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:18,168
[SPEAKER_06]: That explains his last few movies.

735
00:44:18,468 --> 00:44:23,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anyway, since Christophe Gann is not on the next film, Roger Avery took a hike as well.

736
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:34,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, see, what's going on is that Gann has said to a French magazine, DVD Ranma, that the sequel was ordered by Sony, but he's kind of too busy with other movies like Onimusha.

737
00:44:35,499 --> 00:44:37,661
[SPEAKER_09]: which he's adapting that game as well, obviously.

738
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:39,142
[SPEAKER_09]: So he can't do it.

739
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:46,027
[SPEAKER_09]: He said this, quote, If I cannot take on Silent Hill 2 myself, the director who does would need to continue in the same style as the first film.

740
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:47,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make you excited, Shane?

741
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:49,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Except not crappy.

742
00:44:49,749 --> 00:44:51,110
[SPEAKER_06]: He did get the style right.

743
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:56,914
[SPEAKER_09]: One does not want to make a Hollywood-style movie, and I think that it makes sense if the director of the sequel is European.

744
00:44:56,954 --> 00:44:59,016
[SPEAKER_09]: In the best-case scenario, French.

745
00:45:01,537 --> 00:45:02,158
[SPEAKER_09]: So there it is.

746
00:45:02,973 --> 00:45:07,539
[SPEAKER_09]: and Roger Avery said if I'm not going to do Silent Hill 2, if Kristoff's not going to do it.

747
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:08,740
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

748
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,541
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need them.

749
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:11,984
[SPEAKER_08]: They should just go the way of the Resident Evil movies.

750
00:45:12,124 --> 00:45:17,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Resident Evil's bad because they don't really follow, well, anything.

751
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:26,202
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of gone on its own tangent, but it'd be cool if Silent Hill kind of took over the world and then you have people trying to survive all these mutated evil things.

752
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:28,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody enjoyed the Silent Hill movie, though.

753
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of people didn't.

754
00:45:29,665 --> 00:45:30,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked it, though.

755
00:45:30,526 --> 00:45:32,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then they could just make a sequel for me.

756
00:45:32,668 --> 00:45:33,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

757
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:35,030
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have me write it.

758
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,031
[SPEAKER_09]: It just stars Pyramid Head.

759
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:39,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, they should have me write it.

760
00:45:39,512 --> 00:45:40,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I will write the Silent Hill movie.

761
00:45:40,992 --> 00:45:42,433
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Pyramid Head gone wild.

762
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:50,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, they just need to look at the second game and then take the dialogue and then add some scenes where the action takes place and there you got your second movie.

763
00:45:50,997 --> 00:45:58,761
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I don't want it to turn into is I don't want Silent Hill series to turn into like the Halloween series where it's just like Pyramid Head kills everything.

764
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:02,963
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Pyramid Head at summer camp killing lovely young ladies.

765
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:06,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if they wanted a spin-off series, I'm all fine with that.

766
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:09,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Freddy vs. Jason vs. Pyramid Head?

767
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:13,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know they'd both die, because Pyramid Head's awesome.

768
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,490
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be awesome.

769
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Because nobody can kill Pyramid Head.

770
00:46:17,231 --> 00:46:18,991
[SPEAKER_06]: He has to end up offing himself.

771
00:46:20,672 --> 00:46:23,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Son of Dad says a Luc Besson Silent Hill would own.

772
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:25,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't he the guy that did the fifth element?

773
00:46:26,393 --> 00:46:27,074
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be pretty hot.

774
00:46:27,114 --> 00:46:27,954
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be hot.

775
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:29,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

776
00:46:29,694 --> 00:46:30,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

777
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:31,515
[SPEAKER_09]: We shall see.

778
00:46:33,260 --> 00:47:01,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Bruce Willis as Pyramid Head No, Bruce Willis versus Pyramid Head, that would be fun Sean McLean versus Pyramid Head Die Hard 5 They'd just take out the whole fucking world between them Okay, so guess what else, speaking of weird bizarreness That episode of South Park where they did the World of Warcraft thing which I finally saw two days ago is up for an Emmy

779
00:47:02,506 --> 00:47:06,189
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

780
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:26,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, shut up.

781
00:47:26,964 --> 00:47:32,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was so bored that I decided to watch the South Park episode of World of Warcraft.

782
00:47:33,328 --> 00:47:34,549
[SPEAKER_06]: The other way around, you know what I mean?

783
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:36,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it live up to your expectations?

784
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:42,273
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of funny, but there was stuff that was wrong, but I did think it was, Your son's character is going to die!

785
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:43,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh shit.

786
00:47:44,315 --> 00:47:44,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Mom!

787
00:47:44,815 --> 00:47:45,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Bathroom!

788
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:46,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Bathroom!

789
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:50,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people who get like that and it's so stupid, so I thought it was funny.

790
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So does it deserve an Emmy?

791
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:54,257
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

792
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,679
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the Emmy for?

793
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:59,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

794
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,021
[SPEAKER_06]: This is nominated for one.

795
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:02,862
[SPEAKER_09]: It just got nominated for one.

796
00:48:02,882 --> 00:48:03,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

797
00:48:03,242 --> 00:48:08,145
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets the Poop Award for animated defecation.

798
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:11,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

799
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:15,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's going to be some good stuff coming out this week.

800
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a whole lot, but some pretty good stuff.

801
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:30,380
[SPEAKER_08]: In the US, if you're a fan of the NASCAR series, you'll be happy to know there's a new game coming out from EA, NASCAR 08, on PlayStation 2, 360, and the PlayStation 3.

802
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:39,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Also on PlayStation 2 this week, Shimogane Tensei Persona 3, which I meant to play this week, but it never got around to it.

803
00:48:40,005 --> 00:48:41,005
[SPEAKER_08]: That is also coming out.

804
00:48:41,446 --> 00:48:46,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And then a small little game called Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s.

805
00:48:46,648 --> 00:48:49,070
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be making its way out on PlayStation 2.

806
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:58,894
[SPEAKER_08]: and then let's see here on the PSP we have Final Fantasy 2 which I'm trying to finish Final Fantasy 1 so I can play this.

807
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:04,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Alien Syndrome is going to be coming out on the Wii and PSP.

808
00:49:05,717 --> 00:49:12,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Also a weird game from Eidos called Escape from Bug Island which you may know as Necronasia.

809
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't very good in Japan so now it's mediocre over here.

810
00:49:18,562 --> 00:49:18,742
[SPEAKER_08]: And

811
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:25,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not really surprised at this, but yet another Tycoon games coming out on PC.

812
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:35,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Ride, Carnival Tycoon, and yeah, Let's Ride Friends Forever, yet another horse riding game.

813
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:37,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, horse riding games.

814
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:39,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dynasty Warriors DS on the DS, of course.

815
00:49:39,961 --> 00:49:41,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally misheard that title, by the way.

816
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:43,448
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you hear it as?

817
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:45,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's, what, ride friends?

818
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:46,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

819
00:49:46,629 --> 00:49:47,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's ride friends.

820
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's ride friends forever.

821
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:53,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Let horses ride friends.

822
00:49:54,112 --> 00:49:54,832
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wrong.

823
00:49:55,232 --> 00:49:56,032
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

824
00:49:56,072 --> 00:49:56,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is your mind?

825
00:49:57,413 --> 00:49:58,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you sure you're only on bike getting?

826
00:49:59,233 --> 00:49:59,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.

827
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:04,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And Civilization IV Expansion Pack will also be coming out this week as well.

828
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:07,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Civ IV Beyond the Sword.

829
00:50:08,016 --> 00:50:08,316
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

830
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:09,672
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

831
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:37,254
[SPEAKER_09]: The Last Time I Played It The Controls Were Tight Enough

832
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:18,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming out in Japan, Mario Party 8, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, and some jigsaw puzzle games coming out from Hudson Entertainment, Mobile Suit Gundam, and just for you, Jamie, Puyo Puyo 15th Anniversary.

833
00:51:18,806 --> 00:51:19,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Puyo Puyo!

834
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:20,847
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Nintendo Wii.

835
00:51:20,927 --> 00:51:21,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but seriously.

836
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:24,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, how many of those Puyo Puyo games have come out?

837
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:26,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a bunch of Puyo Puyo games.

838
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I even have the PC Engine one.

839
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:39,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Major League Baseball 2K7, Mina No Golf 5, and Wangan Midnight is coming out on the PlayStation 3.

840
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:41,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit, I want to practically import that game.

841
00:51:42,465 --> 00:51:43,265
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks awesome.

842
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:44,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the arcade series.

843
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:47,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw screenshots for that, and I thought that was kind of interesting.

844
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,128
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like it's the first game, though.

845
00:51:50,168 --> 00:51:50,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

846
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:52,529
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you practically import it?

847
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:53,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, just get the instruction book?

848
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:54,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because PlayStation 3 is...

849
00:51:56,246 --> 00:52:00,008
[SPEAKER_06]: He would put in his order with all sorts of practicality.

850
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:05,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, if I'm going to rationalize getting a PlayStation 3, that's one of the games that would actually make me want to do it, because I love that arcade.

851
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:09,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's region-free for the games, though.

852
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:10,134
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only thing.

853
00:52:10,234 --> 00:52:10,954
[SPEAKER_08]: God damn it.

854
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:11,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

855
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:12,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hold on.

856
00:52:13,075 --> 00:52:15,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was region-free for games, not for movies.

857
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:17,838
[SPEAKER_08]: The site that's selling this says no region protection.

858
00:52:18,158 --> 00:52:18,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then awesome.

859
00:52:18,858 --> 00:52:19,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to import that.

860
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:20,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck yeah.

861
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, me too.

862
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:24,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, fuck yeah twice.

863
00:52:25,262 --> 00:52:25,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-uh.

864
00:52:27,474 --> 00:52:28,435
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to fuck you out twice.

865
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, also, another game goes into Sega Ages.

866
00:52:59,892 --> 00:53:04,454
[SPEAKER_09]: This would be Volume 30, Galaxy Force 2 in Japan.

867
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:07,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you a big fan of Galaxy Force, DarkSakura?

868
00:53:08,156 --> 00:53:09,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no.

869
00:53:09,517 --> 00:53:09,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

870
00:53:10,778 --> 00:53:13,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo DS is getting a lot of games as well.

871
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:15,460
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a big release week for games over there.

872
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Taiko no Tatoujin on the DS is coming out over there.

873
00:53:19,642 --> 00:53:20,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And also...

874
00:53:21,087 --> 00:53:21,767
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.

875
00:53:21,847 --> 00:53:22,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Another Hello Kitty game.

876
00:53:23,028 --> 00:53:28,769
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's called Hello Kitty No Ashare Party Sanrio Characters Zuken DS.

877
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:30,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that a mouthful?

878
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:34,130
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an action game, but it has all your favorite Hello Kitty characters.

879
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:39,432
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Twinstar, I see Kuropi, but I don't see Batsmaru, so this game fails.

880
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:43,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if there's anything on the PSP real quick.

881
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:47,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Alex Silvara in the chatroom says, Wangan Midnight equals Maximum Tune 2.

882
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:49,489
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not necessarily.

883
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:51,611
[SPEAKER_09]: The box art doesn't say it's Maximum Tune 2.

884
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:53,613
[SPEAKER_09]: It just calls it Wangan Midnight.

885
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:54,994
[SPEAKER_06]: What if it's all-encompassing?

886
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's all-encompassing or what it is.

887
00:53:56,856 --> 00:53:59,839
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be ideal, I would think, on the PlayStation 3.

888
00:53:59,899 --> 00:54:02,161
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to look up more information on this game.

889
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:04,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, are you looking that up right now?

890
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:05,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was looking.

891
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:09,866
[SPEAKER_08]: It is region-free, and it's not that expensive either, which is good.

892
00:54:10,306 --> 00:54:16,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like, I don't know if it's all in Japanese or something, because some of those games can actually be in English as well.

893
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,711
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I don't know.

894
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:18,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to be careful.

895
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:23,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, on the Sony PSP, you finally get Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories in Japan.

896
00:54:23,655 --> 00:54:24,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom's bringing that to you.

897
00:54:25,036 --> 00:54:30,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I always think that's interesting how that works intercontinental there, how different companies can bring the games.

898
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:36,783
[SPEAKER_08]: See, because the other game that I would like to get also maybe would be Folk Soul.

899
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:38,864
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like folklore.

900
00:54:39,745 --> 00:54:41,306
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be coming over here soon.

901
00:54:41,786 --> 00:54:43,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's all I got for Japanese releases.

902
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:45,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I can get Laird.

903
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:47,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have some European releases, but only a few.

904
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:59,357
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Guilty Gear Dust Strikers on DS, Guilty Gear Judgment on PSP, and they're finally getting the Pokemans, Diamond and Pearl, which was also a Prince album.

905
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:01,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

906
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:03,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that was quick.

907
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:15,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because there's other games listed to be announced titles, but, you know, there's nothing really specific, which I would assume that some of these would already be out, I would hope.

908
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:17,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Saints Row is listed for PS3.

909
00:55:18,826 --> 00:55:26,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here's the deal with Wangan Midnight and all that, is that I'm looking at Wikipedia, and apparently this is actually the third game in the series.

910
00:55:27,173 --> 00:55:29,795
[SPEAKER_09]: So this would be like Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 3.

911
00:55:30,236 --> 00:55:34,980
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a simultaneous release in the arcade, PlayStation 3, and PSP.

912
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:35,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.

913
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,161
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.

914
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:37,582
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty rad.

915
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Sign me up.

916
00:55:39,664 --> 00:55:41,765
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be, I might try that.

917
00:55:42,986 --> 00:55:45,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't it be amazing if they did that for like a good series?

918
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,693
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't like that game?

919
00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:50,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care about it, I've never played it

920
00:55:51,437 --> 00:55:52,357
[SPEAKER_09]: You've never played it?

921
00:55:52,397 --> 00:55:54,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Then how can you not get for that?

922
00:55:54,198 --> 00:55:55,718
[SPEAKER_09]: The soundtrack is amazing.

923
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:56,558
[SPEAKER_07]: That's there.

924
00:55:56,598 --> 00:55:57,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I can not get for that.

925
00:55:57,338 --> 00:55:58,999
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a Politeary song on it.

926
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:00,359
[SPEAKER_07]: One Politeary song.

927
00:56:00,439 --> 00:56:03,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's good because it's No It's Usual Koshiro.

928
00:56:03,399 --> 00:56:05,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Is she like getting stabbed in the throat in it?

929
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:05,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

930
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt it.

931
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,881
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like that in every song she sings I know, but I doubt it.

932
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:10,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

933
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:13,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Drunami sets Miklatov on fire in chat.

934
00:56:14,182 --> 00:56:17,282
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says, LOL Shane's being a dick tonight.

935
00:56:17,602 --> 00:56:18,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight?

936
00:56:22,515 --> 00:56:24,756
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like I'm being a jerk again.

937
00:56:25,296 --> 00:56:26,177
[SPEAKER_07]: It never stops.

938
00:56:26,497 --> 00:56:26,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

939
00:56:27,097 --> 00:56:27,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Gosh.

940
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I always have something negative to say.

941
00:56:30,259 --> 00:56:34,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I wondered why we hadn't had you on this show in a long time, and then I remembered why.

942
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I hate things and stuff.

943
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:37,942
[SPEAKER_07]: You hate things and stuff.

944
00:56:38,122 --> 00:56:38,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And stuff.

945
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:39,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.

946
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:40,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And stuff.

947
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:41,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And stuff.

948
00:56:42,084 --> 00:56:43,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn those things and stuff.

949
00:56:44,285 --> 00:56:44,605
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

950
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:45,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

951
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:46,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we move on to more news, please?

952
00:56:46,926 --> 00:56:47,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to end this segment.

953
00:56:48,747 --> 00:56:49,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So other things to hate...

954
00:56:51,901 --> 00:56:55,522
[SPEAKER_08]: X-07's gone, so where are we going to get some more news from Microsoft?

955
00:56:55,962 --> 00:56:57,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, eh, it's okay.

956
00:56:57,863 --> 00:57:00,224
[SPEAKER_08]: From rumors around the internet, because they're always true.

957
00:57:00,644 --> 00:57:01,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

958
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:02,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, same goes with Sony.

959
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:05,006
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get into that a little bit later.

960
00:57:05,386 --> 00:57:11,368
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, yeah, there's no real X-07 this year, according to Microsoft exec Aaron Greenberg.

961
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:18,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, they are going to be trying to do some sort of other event that will be taking place in the UK.

962
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,571
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

963
00:57:21,516 --> 00:57:21,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

964
00:57:21,977 --> 00:57:22,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Other event?

965
00:57:23,578 --> 00:57:24,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Party at Chuck E. Cheese.

966
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,663
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have Chuck E. Cheese over there.

967
00:57:27,703 --> 00:57:29,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go to Chuck E. Cheese.

968
00:57:29,985 --> 00:57:32,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Chuck E. Cheese is nasty pizza, though, but they do have good pizza.

969
00:57:32,288 --> 00:57:34,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike's Incredible, or John's Incredible Pizza, or whatever it is.

970
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:35,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that new one here?

971
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:36,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we should go there.

972
00:57:36,272 --> 00:57:37,493
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have that in the UK either.

973
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:40,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have, like, Chuck E. Cheese type places in the UK?

974
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:40,837
[SPEAKER_09]: What do they call it?

975
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have Pizza Time Theater, please?

976
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:44,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Please email me right now.

977
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:46,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go to Chuck E. Cheese to go play Pump It Up.

978
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I would figure you would know, Jamie, because you're up on your British culture.

979
00:57:49,911 --> 00:57:51,832
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't care about Chuck E. Cheese.

980
00:57:52,152 --> 00:57:52,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, right.

981
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:55,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't cared about Chuck E. Cheese since it was showbiz.

982
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:57,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe somebody will email us and tell us.

983
00:57:57,714 --> 00:57:59,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know if you have Pizza Time Theater, please.

984
00:58:00,305 --> 00:58:00,545
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

985
00:58:00,785 --> 00:58:08,789
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, speaking of emails, we're going to get to the mailbag very shortly here and read the avalanche of emails that came into our mailbox this week at mailbag at orangehunter.com.

986
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:09,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everybody.

987
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:12,331
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, this was a big story here.

988
00:58:13,212 --> 00:58:15,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter Moore has left Microsoft.

989
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:15,933
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

990
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:18,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter Moore has become very well known lately.

991
00:58:18,635 --> 00:58:21,276
[SPEAKER_09]: He's kind of like the face of Microsoft at a lot of these events.

992
00:58:21,576 --> 00:58:22,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter Moore, EA Sports

993
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,235
[SPEAKER_09]: is what his new role is going to be.

994
00:58:48,335 --> 00:58:54,737
[SPEAKER_09]: So even though he's gone from working for a giant console maker to a publisher, that's still nothing to blink at.

995
00:58:54,777 --> 00:58:56,077
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still a very important role.

996
00:58:56,497 --> 00:58:57,937
[SPEAKER_09]: EA makes crap loads of money.

997
00:58:58,597 --> 00:59:05,719
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're wondering who is going to replace Peter Moore, well, it's going to be Don Matrick, who comes from EA.

998
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:07,419
[SPEAKER_09]: He's coming from EA.

999
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:08,599
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1000
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:15,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And it'll be interesting to see if this has any type of changes on Microsoft's PR, but probably not.

1001
00:59:17,093 --> 00:59:17,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not really.

1002
00:59:17,713 --> 00:59:19,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be the same old stuff.

1003
00:59:20,654 --> 00:59:21,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1004
00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:24,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Son of Dad says Peter Moore quit to go work at Showbiz.

1005
00:59:25,857 --> 00:59:26,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what's funny?

1006
00:59:26,517 --> 00:59:28,118
[SPEAKER_09]: You know where Reggie Fils-Aimé came from?

1007
00:59:28,158 --> 00:59:30,198
[SPEAKER_09]: You know one of the places he worked before he was at Nintendo?

1008
00:59:30,378 --> 00:59:31,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Pizza Time Theater.

1009
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:31,819
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1010
00:59:32,279 --> 00:59:32,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Panda Express.

1011
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1012
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:34,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1013
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,521
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, look at, you know...

1014
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:38,700
[SPEAKER_03]: The Panda Express is nasty.

1015
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,220
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's everywhere now.

1016
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,421
[SPEAKER_09]: It's insanely popular.

1017
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:44,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if that was his doing or what, but there you go.

1018
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,583
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was the doing of people addicted to MSG.

1019
00:59:48,344 --> 00:59:48,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1020
00:59:49,444 --> 00:59:49,704
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1021
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:54,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we mentioned the mailbag's coming up, so let's get into the mailbag.

1022
00:59:54,766 --> 00:59:57,707
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura likes to read your emails that you send us every week.

1023
00:59:58,148 --> 01:00:04,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, DarkSakura is forced at gunpoint to read your emails that you send to us twice a week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1024
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,791
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's get out the old...

1025
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Gun, and I'll just shine up the gun and point it at Jamie's head.

1026
01:00:11,102 --> 01:00:11,802
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

1027
01:00:12,462 --> 01:00:13,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's read some emails.

1028
01:00:15,223 --> 01:00:16,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I'm going to pull the trigger.

1029
01:00:16,043 --> 01:00:17,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Rob.

1030
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:18,024
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1031
01:00:18,344 --> 01:00:20,025
[SPEAKER_06]: S-T-F-U-M-F.

1032
01:00:21,225 --> 01:00:22,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll shoot the kitties.

1033
01:00:22,546 --> 01:00:23,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I will shoot the caturday.

1034
01:00:24,406 --> 01:00:24,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

1035
01:00:26,027 --> 01:00:27,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we got two whole emails.

1036
01:00:28,168 --> 01:00:31,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, people, because I can't really read very well right now.

1037
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:32,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1038
01:00:33,268 --> 01:00:36,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I am heading to Anaheim, California from August 3rd through 7th for BlizzCon.

1039
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:38,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, everybody look for this guy.

1040
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys going?

1041
01:00:40,496 --> 01:00:43,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you are, I want to grab some food and a restaurant.

1042
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to grab a restaurant too.

1043
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:50,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And most likely other people from World of Warcraft Radio, I guess.

1044
01:00:50,808 --> 01:00:52,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you guys don't think... Okay, never mind.

1045
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:54,032
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy's just inviting us to lunch.

1046
01:00:55,203 --> 01:00:57,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's that from?

1047
01:00:58,025 --> 01:01:10,196
[SPEAKER_06]: SpeedyF40 Yeah, he's plugged the WoW radio thing before You know, if you were there the last weekend of this month, then you can go to Disneyland with me if you pay How does that work?

1048
01:01:10,636 --> 01:01:15,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not going to BlizzCon, none of us are going to BlizzCon, but you know who is going to BlizzCon?

1049
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:18,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Blizzard is going to BlizzCon!

1050
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,243
[SPEAKER_09]: from his sister and her fiancé who both also play WoW in our guild.

1051
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:36,024
[SPEAKER_09]: So look for Extifer.

1052
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:42,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually want to send him with the tape recorder and microphone to do some interviews at BlizzCon because I think it would be hilarious.

1053
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:42,850
[SPEAKER_00]: He should.

1054
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:46,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to be your OLR representation at BlizzCon right there.

1055
01:01:46,653 --> 01:01:52,458
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, because of the move and everything, it's too close to the finances for me.

1056
01:01:52,478 --> 01:01:55,661
[SPEAKER_08]: It probably doesn't help also that all the tickets sold out within like a few hours.

1057
01:01:55,681 --> 01:01:58,043
[SPEAKER_09]: That didn't help either, and I was out of town when they went on sale.

1058
01:01:58,103 --> 01:01:59,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, I might have bought one.

1059
01:01:59,544 --> 01:01:59,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well.

1060
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:04,400
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be interesting to see me go to BlizzCon because I have no interest in World of Warcraft.

1061
01:02:05,441 --> 01:02:09,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Drunami says if we hang out with WoW Radio, we should say hi to TotalBiscuit.

1062
01:02:09,344 --> 01:02:11,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who that is, but I'm sure somebody listening does.

1063
01:02:11,605 --> 01:02:13,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, TotalBiscuit!

1064
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:15,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I read the next email, please?

1065
01:02:15,228 --> 01:02:15,609
[SPEAKER_06]: You may.

1066
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:16,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1067
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:18,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR crew, it's me, Neki.

1068
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:22,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I haven't emailed in a while, but I've been really busy.

1069
01:02:22,474 --> 01:02:24,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Been loving the show recently, by the way.

1070
01:02:24,315 --> 01:02:25,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Warning, this might be really long.

1071
01:02:26,217 --> 01:02:27,157
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I've got longer.

1072
01:02:27,438 --> 01:02:27,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1073
01:02:28,462 --> 01:02:31,203
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't quite meet the longest email category.

1074
01:02:31,803 --> 01:02:32,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen longer.

1075
01:02:33,204 --> 01:02:34,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen plenty longer.

1076
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:35,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen thicker.

1077
01:02:37,745 --> 01:02:38,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I read, please?

1078
01:02:38,726 --> 01:02:38,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1079
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,146
[SPEAKER_06]: You perverted people.

1080
01:02:40,526 --> 01:02:40,766
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1081
01:02:40,806 --> 01:02:41,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I was talking about emails.

1082
01:02:42,187 --> 01:02:42,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

1083
01:02:43,107 --> 01:02:50,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Boo-hoo, my 360 died earlier this week, and although it's a pain in the ass, Microsoft is very good at cleaning this up.

1084
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:54,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to phone twice, second, because I forgot my original mobile, no.

1085
01:02:55,793 --> 01:03:01,718
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was only on hold for at best 10 minutes each call, so thanks should go to Microsoft for their good support.

1086
01:03:02,098 --> 01:03:06,601
[SPEAKER_06]: The extended warranty shows that they are taking responsibility for it, so I am understanding.

1087
01:03:07,001 --> 01:03:12,405
[SPEAKER_06]: However, dot dot dot dot dot dot dot, the expected time I will get my Berk 360 back is over one month.

1088
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:16,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, did Microsoft say they have fixed the problem with the new Xbox 360s?

1089
01:03:17,088 --> 01:03:19,850
[SPEAKER_06]: If so, I intended to shell out for a new 360 instead.

1090
01:03:22,017 --> 01:03:27,180
[SPEAKER_06]: The good point to my 360 dying is that I finally have dug out my old PS2.

1091
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the games seem unusual now and look bad graphics.

1092
01:03:32,483 --> 01:03:38,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing is that the PlayStation controllers seem tiny after using the Xbox 360 controllers alone for five to six months.

1093
01:03:38,746 --> 01:03:40,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you want to see tiny?

1094
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:45,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Try playing with a dual analog controller for the Saturn and everything will look tiny to you.

1095
01:03:46,331 --> 01:03:46,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me.

1096
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, a note on email last week.

1097
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:52,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I fully support younger online players who are online.

1098
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:53,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I am now 15.

1099
01:03:53,950 --> 01:04:01,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I can truthfully say that I am definitely more mature than other even 30-year-old players who use the N-word.

1100
01:04:02,392 --> 01:04:05,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'm not going to let this go on really long, so bye, Neki.

1101
01:04:05,773 --> 01:04:06,153
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

1102
01:04:06,473 --> 01:04:08,634
[SPEAKER_06]: This is good gramming speller LOLs.

1103
01:04:09,614 --> 01:04:14,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I could point them out, but I'm not going to because I'm too doped up to be a bitch tonight.

1104
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:16,436
[SPEAKER_06]: and PPS, look for me in the chat room.

1105
01:04:16,536 --> 01:04:17,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw you there.

1106
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say something.

1107
01:04:18,578 --> 01:04:19,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Necky.

1108
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:20,879
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so lying.

1109
01:04:20,919 --> 01:04:21,420
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't look.

1110
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

1111
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,702
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Necky popped in and I even voiced him.

1112
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:25,282
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1113
01:04:25,302 --> 01:04:28,805
[SPEAKER_06]: And Necky is one of our listeners from the UK, so to be in our chat room right now.

1114
01:04:29,205 --> 01:04:30,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, your parents know you're up.

1115
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:35,449
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a question in there about the Xbox 360 and have they fixed... It's 3 a.m.

1116
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:38,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, have they fixed the problem on Xbox 360?

1117
01:04:38,612 --> 01:04:39,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe they have.

1118
01:04:39,192 --> 01:04:43,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't they change the chips that were going in the Xbox 360 as part of to change that problem, Loki?

1119
01:04:43,395 --> 01:04:43,435
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1120
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:44,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I wrong?

1121
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:45,735
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't change chips.

1122
01:04:45,795 --> 01:04:51,301
[SPEAKER_08]: They changed the heat sinks that were on the graphics chips and stuff.

1123
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:55,985
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the new ones are being fixed, I guess.

1124
01:04:56,085 --> 01:04:58,448
[SPEAKER_09]: So then the new system shouldn't have this problem.

1125
01:04:59,349 --> 01:05:01,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Theoretically, unless there's something else that goes wrong.

1126
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,232
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1127
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:03,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll see what happens.

1128
01:05:04,374 --> 01:05:05,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's it for email.

1129
01:05:06,354 --> 01:05:06,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1130
01:05:07,815 --> 01:05:08,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an email.

1131
01:05:08,856 --> 01:05:13,178
[SPEAKER_09]: The Rob D in chat confirms they changed the heat sink so heat distribution is different.

1132
01:05:13,578 --> 01:05:13,979
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1133
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:15,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an email.

1134
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:15,880
[SPEAKER_07]: You have an email?

1135
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got it right here.

1136
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:18,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1137
01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:20,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It says Dear Orange Lounge Radio.

1138
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,440
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1139
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to Comic Con.

1140
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:26,681
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be awesome.

1141
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:27,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, this is you.

1142
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:31,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you told us this before the show.

1143
01:05:32,182 --> 01:05:36,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I thought maybe if you needed me to do something down there for you guys, I could.

1144
01:05:36,803 --> 01:05:40,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm not going as part of any sort of group, except for the awesome group of Shane.

1145
01:05:40,664 --> 01:05:42,645
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to hunt down Udon Crew for me.

1146
01:05:42,665 --> 01:05:44,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have a couple artists I want you to hunt down for me.

1147
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:46,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I have an assignment for you.

1148
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:51,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not taking... No, no, on behalf of Orange Ons Radio, this is what I need you to do.

1149
01:05:51,302 --> 01:06:00,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I want you to go down to Comic-Con, and I want you to go to the Heroes panel with a big burlap sack, and I want you to push Siler into the sack and bring him back to Sacramento with you.

1150
01:06:00,988 --> 01:06:01,848
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that have to do with video games?

1151
01:06:01,988 --> 01:06:02,989
[SPEAKER_09]: And then have him here.

1152
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:07,772
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually has nothing to do with video games, but it has to do with the wellness and well-being of our program.

1153
01:06:08,412 --> 01:06:11,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but I already... He said, I want Siler here in my house when I get back.

1154
01:06:12,013 --> 01:06:13,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I claimed Siler, I'm sorry.

1155
01:06:14,695 --> 01:06:15,075
[SPEAKER_07]: You suck.

1156
01:06:15,435 --> 01:06:16,915
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the BSG people I like.

1157
01:06:17,315 --> 01:06:18,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, and the 4400 people I like.

1158
01:06:18,616 --> 01:06:20,717
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have Helo, I just want Siler.

1159
01:06:20,817 --> 01:06:22,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally get Helo.

1160
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:23,098
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1161
01:06:24,718 --> 01:06:28,980
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anybody going to Comic-Con to have fun, I'll be having fun for at least one of those days.

1162
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,081
[SPEAKER_07]: The Heroes and Battlestar Galactica panel days.

1163
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,382
[SPEAKER_09]: They do some video game stuff at Comic-Con, too, though, right?

1164
01:06:34,402 --> 01:06:36,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they have a Phoenix Wright thing that I'm going to go to.

1165
01:06:36,263 --> 01:06:37,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's cosplayers.

1166
01:06:38,152 --> 01:06:40,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Who I'll probably hit if they come near me.

1167
01:06:42,193 --> 01:06:46,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll probably have the cast of the new Who Wants to Be a Superhero where people get cash and prizes.

1168
01:06:46,154 --> 01:06:47,994
[SPEAKER_07]: They have old Fat Mama or whatever.

1169
01:06:48,014 --> 01:06:48,795
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to be there.

1170
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:49,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Rockin'.

1171
01:06:49,415 --> 01:06:50,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Fat Mama.

1172
01:06:50,095 --> 01:06:50,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And somebody else.

1173
01:06:50,815 --> 01:06:51,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget.

1174
01:06:51,695 --> 01:06:52,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1175
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:53,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1176
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:58,357
[SPEAKER_09]: WonderDogHerald says, Miglatov should get the Comic-Con only Penny Arcade poster for OLR.

1177
01:06:59,057 --> 01:06:59,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, why don't you do that?

1178
01:06:59,837 --> 01:07:00,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Work on that.

1179
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:01,217
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1180
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:02,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Penny Arcade?

1181
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:03,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate them.

1182
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:04,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1183
01:07:04,378 --> 01:07:06,159
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really big jerks in real life.

1184
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:06,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I love them.

1185
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:13,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in line with one of the guys buying a hamburger at E3 two years ago.

1186
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've never had a bad experience.

1187
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:16,747
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened with you?

1188
01:07:16,887 --> 01:07:17,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in the one-up...

1189
01:07:18,647 --> 01:07:19,928
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1190
01:07:47,321 --> 01:07:48,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Son of Dad says Comic Con will have a big Capcom presence.

1191
01:07:49,002 --> 01:07:49,462
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like Capcom.

1192
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:09,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Devil May Cry 4

1193
01:08:18,507 --> 01:08:19,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's going to be there?

1194
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:19,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1195
01:08:19,927 --> 01:08:20,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'll go play that.

1196
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:30,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I really wasn't planning on doing anything video game related, except for some producer of the Ace Attorney series is going to be autographing things, and so that's why I want to go over to their booth.

1197
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:40,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Konami's doing something, but I don't know if it's anything beyond Yu-Gi crap, so maybe some Silent Hill if I cross my fingers enough.

1198
01:08:40,372 --> 01:08:44,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think there might be anything Disney-related, possibly, that could show up?

1199
01:08:44,793 --> 01:08:45,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1200
01:08:46,016 --> 01:08:47,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonder what you're hinting at.

1201
01:08:47,217 --> 01:08:47,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1202
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:50,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what you could possibly be hinting at.

1203
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:51,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't go on the internet ever.

1204
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:58,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just happen to know that Disney is a very popular cartoon series and could possibly have a relation there.

1205
01:08:58,145 --> 01:08:58,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1206
01:08:59,566 --> 01:09:00,647
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1207
01:09:02,449 --> 01:09:05,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1208
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:06,912
[SPEAKER_09]: We definitely need a break now.

1209
01:09:07,692 --> 01:09:10,775
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1210
01:09:11,591 --> 01:09:16,574
