first-time listeners tonight I was noticing some folks saying it was our

32
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,040
first time listening so hello to all of you first-time listeners in chat it's

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,600
kind of a smaller audience in chat tonight though what I was thinking maybe

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,640
part of that is that people are reading Harry Potter right now they are they

35
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,760
should actually be done with it because it's been out for like two days so you

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,720
finished an hour before I before I left the house oh my gosh so you finished the

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,560
last night but I had to play D&D I just wanted to get done with it because then

40
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,080
I could go back on the internet and not get spoiled by things I know I hate all

41
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,000
of you spoiler people yes and no spoilers in chat tonight don't even try

43
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,560

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,240
your ass I went directly to the spoiler page as soon as I found it you know I

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,560
don't know it's part of me I like to be spoiled and find out what's gonna happen

46
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,320
I don't even really read the book so watch the movies I haven't seen the

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,800
newest one in fact I didn't see the fourth one either but I like the first

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,480
three movies they're cool the fifth movie sucks now Jamie did you actually

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,920

Amazon oh so you had to deliver to your house yes I went to Barnes and Noble

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,680
because I was also high on Vicodin I couldn't drive to the bookstore

52
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,280
although Dan said that he went to Walmart and almost bought me one the

53
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,480
Rob D says spoiler Jesus dies on page 681 oh you weren't looking for Bible

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,520
spoilers get it I think I saw that I think I saw that same joke on dig this

55
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,960
week failed I'm just kidding no but I went I went to Barnes and Noble at about

56
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,880
1030 on Friday and there were already a ton of people there because I wasn't

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,880
there to buy Harry Potter smelly people there was the fattest Hermione I'd ever

58
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,160
seen in my life was there actually so but I went bought the book for stardust

59
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,320
because I got to see a sneak preview of that movie that's coming out a couple

60
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,240
weeks stardust and I loved it it was like a video game I had Sky Pirates like

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,840
Final Fantasy 12 it was awesome and like magic and Michelle Pfeiffer was which it

62
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,720
was great so I I wanted to get the book that it was based on and they had it at

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,480
Barnes and Noble but then like I had to like go through crowds and crowds of

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,840
people it was crazy why did you go on Harry Potter night because I was there I

65
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,120
went to two Barnes and Nobles for Harry Potter night we went to eat at dos

66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,600
coyotes was like right next door to Barnes and Noble so we just decided to

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,280
go there I was like I want to get the stardust book right now I was there too

68
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,640
waiting with my wife for the book and I was playing Final Fantasy well that

69
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,120
makes you a nerd too I waited in the Harry Potter line last year and I

70
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,040
already bought my British one online and I ended up the still wasn't as bad as

71
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,320
the Dreamcast line in 99 the Dreamcast line I sat and read books I just walked

72
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,520
into games or EB games when James came out so did I I just was like we did the

73
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,040
midnight thing at a GameStop I don't think Wichita is big enough for that

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,120
looking in chat room uninvited says we handed out cupcakes for our book release

75
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,880
at Walmart and this old smelly lady came up and ate like 12 one per person unless

76
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,680
you ordered 12 books or had a little sign or something but that just kind of

77
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,080
reminded me of the time the we came out and we were handing out you know the

78
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,880
soda and the doughnuts and smelly people it was some were smelly but not at the

79
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,400
target we ended up staying it was they were all well well-bathed it's too cold to be smelly cuz

80
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,440
when it's cold you can't really smell people as badly as when it's hot like

81
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,880
anime conventions I think that fanboy funk is worse in the summer if you let

82
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,240
it sit out for a little while all right boy funk does not take summer vacation

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,720
all right let's let's talk about video games we're like more than five minutes

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,760
in the show we haven't talked about video games just been that I said Final

85
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:46,600
Fantasy video games are video games too but they're not good cuz why is why

86
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,640
isn't there a good Harry Potter game cuz they're made by you haven't made me

87
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,000
design one that's not mean that it's a bad it should be a bad game if it's made

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,840
by you know it's the fact that they take franchises and and don't care about them

89
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,320
they're just like oh give me money on them yeah here was now here was the

90
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,800
nerdiest thing ever though we were at claim jumper last night or whatever and

91
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,880
we were going around the table going like what what house would you be in if

92
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,680
you were in Harry Potter probably in sparkly poo there is no sparkly poo you

93
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,880
have to read the fanfiction whatever anyway so we thought why isn't Harry

94
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,640
Potter like an MMO why isn't there an MMO set in the Harry Potter universe

95
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,200
millions of people would play it if they could be you could have like actual like

96
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Quidditch and doing quests in the Harry Potter universe why isn't there actually

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,160
a game on ps2 is fun to exactly whatever it was I don't think the universe would

98
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,440
be that big I mean it'd be Hogwarts and well I guess you could you could have a

99
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,200
bunch of other school there are other schools so well now there's not gonna be

100
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,520
any more books why not have you know why not have an MMO in the Harry Potter

101
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,040
universe hmm who says it's not coming I mean look at Lord of the Rings online I

102
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,040
did the quiz that was on the Warner Brothers site and I got Slytherin I

103
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,200
didn't think I did the quiz I got Ravenclaw I was like what the fuck's a

104
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:10,520
Ravenclaw even smarter because they're also sneaky all right let's get to

105
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,360
actual like video game chat I will start with how was your gaming week dark

106
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,240
soccer how is your games what games I've been high on Vicodin all week so I

107
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,080
haven't played anything not even pinball I did well no I played World Cup soccer

108
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,080
see there's something but I am Ally so I can't really do much gaming all right

109
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,360
well that's all right Loki how was your gaming week I played paper Mario on the

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,800
virtual console not exactly like super paper Mario a little bit disappointing

111
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,440
but I don't know it's tolerable for right now I guess I think if I played

112
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,240
that right after I played Super Mario RPG I would have been greatly

113
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,280
disappointed then I played Final Fantasy I'm actually most the way through the

114
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:03,000
game now what else did I do gaming related I fully disassembled a PSP and

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,080
put it back together again because I was thinking I let me put this way I have

116
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,080
charge cables for my PSP but they're at work and I want to play Final Fantasy my

117
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,960
battery was low so I was going to make my own charge cable but then I couldn't

118
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,440
find this my car adapter cable that was going to hack apart for the second half

119
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,840
of it so I was like well I could just solder some stuff on to the USB port on

120
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,320
to the PSP and just solder that to the power port and then it should be able to

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
charge via USB so I took that all apart and got fascinated with that I'm like

122
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,840
crap this is not going to go back together again is it so I put it back

123
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,000
together and I think it's working now except for some reason though when I put

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,240
the USB charge cable I bought today on it it wasn't lighting up so I don't know

125
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,080
if that's just the battery that's in there that's so dead they won't charge

126
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,640
with that or what but hopefully it works otherwise that's my you know parts PSP

127
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,040
anyway so I gotta sell it so I can get a new one then other than that I tried

128
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,840
playing oh I played Super Rub-a-dub on ps3 crap is that one of those new

129
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,360
downloadable games the one with the Ducks or whatever yes it's the one the

130
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,400
Ducks it's actually a game rap yeah it's it's stupid what do you do in the game

131
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,280
you tilt using the six axis because that's almost every single game that's

132
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,680
downloadable on the PSP right now or ps3 you tilt the six axis to make the Ducks

133
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,840
go around you collect ducks and get to the drain it is crap is so fucking hard

134
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,680
to control it's not fun luckily I didn't download the full game I download the

135
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,720
demo so no money lost is it the Ducks from the old first PlayStation demo they

136
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,040
had from every single demo that they've done so far ducks have been all of them

137
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,120
she's running gag and now it's a game no the game still running gag it's crap

138
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,640
that's what it is gk 128 in our chat room agrees with you super rub-a-dub for

139
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:03,200
the lose he also gk 128 says the controlling super rub-a-dub is so bad it

140
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,840
doesn't even follow your movements right it doesn't and it's just way too

141
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,840
sensitive so no thanks I ended up selling a lot or I sold back

142
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,160
Motorstorm today you know now I'm just stuck with resistance which is you know

143
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,720
great game but I just you know my PlayStation 3 right now is being treated

144
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,560
like my PSP except my PSP has more gaming going along with it because I

145
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,640
don't buy games anymore for it if only they had that for the oh I thought I'm

146
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,920
thinking about modding my weight that might be something that's coming on mod

147
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,960
chips I can play some import games at times all right me go Todd you want to

148
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,280
share with us your gaming week if anything I've still been trying to think

149
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,600
if I played anything this week besides Wow and I don't think I did so I played

150
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,240
Wow what happened in Wow well it made me sad because I decided to level up my

151
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,680
tailoring and there's this one piece of cloth I can only make every three days

152
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,080
in 22 hours so I'm waiting for that time limit to be up I'm just being

153
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,840
disgruntled the whole time while I wait and that's it all right aren't you

154
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,080
exciting I am what's up it's something in the air and not a lot of game playing

155
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:19,240
this week well I do that at work so I guess that's true I could see that I got

156
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,800
a game what'd you get I got Marvel to moon Alliance for Xbox 360 but I didn't

157
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,560
get the gold one cuz Dan was being a cheap but and he said that I could just

158
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,280
download Hawkeye cuz it's really a character I care about okay so instead

159
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,800
downloading the uber thing that had everybody you can just get the one

160
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,000
character you want yeah I haven't played it yet also play Call of Duty 3

161
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,160
multiplayer for a little bit and there's one cool kill they had we were playing

162
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,600
on eater dam and I was driving the Jeep across it and about to jump the little

163
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,240
gap in the middle and then someone shot me in the head luckily for me I fell out

164
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,400
of the Jeep of course I was dead but my Jeep went forward and went over the

165
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,640
jump and ran them over so it was a double kill is hilarious and then of

166
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,160
course grant up that advice series stories still playing that's still

167
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,160
yelling at everybody nerd my gaming week I tried some of the new downloads that

168
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,960
are available on Xbox live marketplace like Bomberman live but I only really

169
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,880
played the demo for Bomberman about download full game so I don't really

170
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,280
want to give a full review but it definitely already right off the bat was

171
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,240
way better than act zero that's for sure even just the demo the free demo is

172
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,240
better than the $60 act zero so I was pleased with that it's like 20 bucks now

173
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,680
still $20 too much that's still $20 too much for that game but it's cool you

174
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,280
know it's it's it's classic Bomberman so if you remember Bomberman from Super

175
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,380
Nintendo days I did notice though that when you do buy the regular version of

176
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,120
it you're gonna be able to customize the game to hell like you know you just

177
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,560
customize like any type of environment you want to play in and different types

178
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,800
of power-ups that are available and all that it's highly customizable so

179
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,080
definitely a great tournament game I'm also played the ER kung-fu although I

180
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,400
didn't buy the full version because I can play the full version on my computer

181
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,200
because I have it through you know game to happen what have you I just checked

182
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,160
out I did like I thought the new graphics are pretty cool but otherwise

183
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,640
it's not really a game I'm very fond of from back in the day I mean like snow

184
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,840
those ones that's like stood up against the test of time yeah you know I've I've

185
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,720
I've I've defended time pilot and even Russian attack to an extent on this show

186
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,520
but I just can't find my love for ER kung-fu not when there's other fighting

187
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,600
games you know like Street Fighter 2 that are better and especially this HD

188
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,160
remix on the way and so that I'm sure gonna be pretty awesome they need to put

189
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,920
the grid on Xbox live pretty rad and the Rob Dean chat says a ER kung-fu is awful

190
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,000
JV Mon says it sucks ass back in the day back in the day I preferred it to kung-fu

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,080
master yeah I way perverted to kung-fu master but just now I just I can't you

192
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,960
know like sometimes I try to I find my retro game love for the simple games but

193
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,800
like ER kung-fu is not one of those games I can just find my love for again

194
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,040
because I guess I never really have there's some of these games on live that

195
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,400
they seem to forget about like you know oh yeah there's downloadable content

196
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,480
coming later and it never does like boom boom rocket I thought there's more songs

197
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,480
it's funny you should mention that because that's another game I got really

198
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,480
into this week randomly like I haven't played boom boom rocket in months and

199
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,840
then this week I was looking at my the high scores and I noticed that I'd

200
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,360
fallen not just to second place within my own friends list but third place

201
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,440
though my own friends list I'm like at one point I had a score in the top 100

202
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,600
okay so I was like alright I got to play this some more and try to improve my

203
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,160
score so I did and I'm back up to second place now within my friends and now I

204
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,160
gotta try and get back up to first place so I'm working on it playing some more

205
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,840
songs but yeah there's no downloadable stuff for boom and rocket at all it's

206
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,400
kind of sad because I'm not a big fan of the tracks that come with the game I

207
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,720
even went to GameStop today I was like I got to get me in another game because I

208
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,400
had I had like Forza 2, Shadowrun and like Tenchu Z and Monster Madness

209
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,280
Bell for suburbia all brand new copies that I got from work but it's like I

210
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,200
don't want to play any of this even Forza 2 I was like well I could maybe

211
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,120
design some cars or something like no that's no I'm not gonna get suckered

212
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,000
into playing this just like I did Project Gotham Racing 3 although Project

213
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,040
Gotham Racing 4 that looks pretty good too but I'm gonna get suckered in buying

214
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,440
that and hate it and then return it back either way to get one of those game

215
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,480
rental accounts doesn't matter I'm gonna get it probably you know Microsoft games

216
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,680
they usually get for free all right JV Mon and Chad agrees with me by the way

217
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,460
that the tracks that come with the game are pretty boring so you go that one I

218
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,800
like is really good I don't know smooth operetta yes smooth operetta yeah that's

219
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,200
a great surprise Konami hasn't done like well I guess they wouldn't want to do

220
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,280
that because of what a downloadable DDR something yeah because they would

221
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,840
compete with their own game so why can't they do a downloadable beat mania or

222
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,400
something even though you know I know there's a special controller comes with

223
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,720
it and all but you know why not do like a button friendly version I don't know I

224
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,300
guess I'm being stupid the other game I got really into randomly this week was

225
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,720
Carcassonne I finally went back and played the demo more fully for that and

226
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,520
I downloaded I ended up spending the cash to get the full game of Carcassonne

227
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,000
because I got more into it into it than I did Settlers of Catan but I'll tell

228
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,400
you this I suck at Carcassonne I am so horrible at that game like it took me

229
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,620
forever to get the strategy down to that game I finally beat the computer in a

230
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,120
match but I'm like in last place I've gone from boom boom rocket a game where

231
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm second place amongst all my friends to Carcassonne where I'm in last place

232
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,160
amongst all my friends because I'm just not that good at it I'm still trying to

233
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,640
figure out the strategy to it but I'm having fun like I like the fact that

234
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,760
it's like a board game but it kind of has its own like you know the you

235
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,080
basically the way Carcassonne is is that you're building a puzzle every time and

236
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,800
that puzzle involves cities and roads and monasteries and all this stuff and

237
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,680
you draw out these cards in a random order and play them down and so you know

238
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,920
roads have to connect to other roads cities have to connect to other cities

239
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,400
and when you claim roads or claim cities and finish them you get a lot of points

240
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,440
for them so it's kind of cool like I've got to play it on Xbox Live and I'm

241
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,080
afraid to cuz I know I'll get my ass handed to me but I guess that's the only

242
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,880
way you're gonna get better at a game like that so but I've been having fun

243
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,720
playing it so yay Carcassonne that's it for my gaming week so we will move from

244
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,400
our gaming weeks to some housekeeping first off we want to thank or

245
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,640
congratulate I should say one of our longtime listeners DDR angel I don't

246
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,680
know if you remember DDR angel I should hope not at all I should hope so she was

247
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,480
here for the longest time she got married today so I'm gonna say

248
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,400
congratulations congratulations miss DDR angel and her husband who by the way

249
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,600
goes online I believe by big red pimp now she's DDR pimp lady yes now she's

250
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,880
DDR pimp so congratulations to DDR miss DDR pimp also no show next week we're

251
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,000
not gonna be doing any show next week there may be a best-ever something that

252
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,800
shows up on the archives that there's time but unfortunately just due to

253
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,080
other obligations there will be no show on July 29th so we're very sorry about

254
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,000
that dark soccer is going to Disneyland again but I am and I'm gonna be high as

255
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,600
a kite there too and usually we would just go ahead and do a show if one of us

256
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,560
is gone but also we're moving this is the very last show you're gonna hear

257
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,120
from studio number three which we've had you know a good couple of years here

258
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,560
we've been here for about two years in this tiny little room but the show

259
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,960
basically if you haven't caught on takes place in my spare bedroom and my

260
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,360
apartment and in a couple weeks it will take place in the spare bedroom or maybe

261
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,680
garage haven't figured it out yet at my new house so I'm very excited about that

262
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,680
kind of moving on up so we will be in the new studio soon that'll be studio

263
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,760
number four so yes the show has been a lot of places over the past five years

264
00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:00,680
so we're excited about that so kind of like a whore what do you mean a little

265
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,400
bit well to use it to use a friend of mine's analogy we're like the house

266
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:15,000
broom everyone's had a ride I get it all right well here's the thing also we're

267
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,720
looking to kind of relaunch of sorts in a couple weeks like not like we're gonna

268
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,440
totally redo the show but maybe try some new things like some new album art some

269
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,000
new openings some new incidental sounds and stuff that play throughout the show

270
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
so if you are a artistic or audio editing type please shoot us an email

271
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,840
because we'd be interested in what you can do for us in regards to it new

272
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,880
intros and new artwork and all that good stuff so more to come in two weeks when

273
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,520
we return with more orange lounge radio for now though let's get to the gaming

274
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,800
news for this week and I believe Loki's gonna start us off tonight yes so this

275
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,000
week there is a bunch of news coming out of Japan during their PlayStation

276
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,600
premiere event in Tokyo and some interesting things coming out mostly

277
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,720
stuff that we're not going to see over here one of which is a TV tuner for the

278
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,040
PSP it's actually a one seg tuner device and kind of attaches to the top of via

279
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:24,000
the USB port much like the GPS receiver and camera and apparently you can tune

280
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,840
into different TV stations and one that's supposed to be coming out in

281
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,240
September and that's kind of cool wish it we'd get something like that over

282
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:40,720
here me something third-party I know why is it that we're not getting any stuff

283
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,400
over here yes never came out over here either and I don't think the camera did

284
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,480
either so maybe we're just not into all those things over here we I know we care

285
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,880
about high-tech gadgets over here but not like Japan does that's why we get

286
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,200
two colors of things sometimes three Japan gets a hundred and fifty eight

287
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,600
versions a week but TVs are kind of cool I don't know I might make the PSP a

288
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,480
little more lucrative it depends how much it costs how much does it cost in

289
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:18,080
Japan I was 6,900 yen that's about what $69 right I'm not mistaken yeah all

290
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,200
right oh by the way it's only compatible with the new PSP not the old one not

291
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,800
that it really matters because in September it's gonna be replacing all

292
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,560
the old ones anyways gee Sony likes to do that replace old stuff oh yeah like

293
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,280
they're the only company out there that redesigns their systems Nintendo I'm

294
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,960
looking at you all right but they make them better and in better colors speaking

295
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,920
of better colors there are more PSP color variations coming out in Japan you

296
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,520
know how we're getting what we're getting like three colors here two

297
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,000
colors in a in the Star Wars okay well over there they're getting piano black

298
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,600
ceramic white and ice silver but they're also getting the bloom series with rose

299
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,760
pink lavender purple and Felicia blue I want that blue one so bad but this

300
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,120
sounds like bubble bath salts colors it's so pretty this sounds like

301
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,600
something a housewife would pour in her bathtub and say Calgon take me away PS

302
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,000
Sony take me away have salt and bubbles because it would not make bubbles well

303
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,160
whatever but still it sounds like baths I'm getting bath salts and bubble baths

304
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,240
mixed up okay so that's six variants on the new PSP and they already had like at

305
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,720
least four of the regular PSP and so I can't help but feel we're really getting

306
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,080
shafted when Sony is doing better over here than they are in Japan well it is

307
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,840

315
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,240
time already but it's sexy sexy remake but the original is better whatever it's

316
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,200
pretty shush original has Maria's crappy singing in it well maybe one of her

317
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,320
weapons is a song book and she kills things by going wow I think I almost

318
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,920
died a little right that's exactly what her voice sounds like to you well

319
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:52,360
anyway anyway um I'm sorry I'm all giggly today no um there is a little bit

320
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,200
of good news for our friends in Europe the PSP will actually be out there it

321
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,880
beginning of September and in Japan it will be there on September 20th so you

322
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,000
guys get it first you can just go rub it in everybody's face so Europe actually

323
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,360
gets something first for once they got stuff first before remember a few games

324
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,080
well nami loves Europe for some reason they get a lot of the cool stuff this

325
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,560
has nothing to do with konami no but it's Europe does get stuff first

326
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,720
sometimes what's that wow but the the price is gonna be the same as the

327
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:30,480
current ones it's a 129.99 what colors are they getting it does not say oh also

328
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,360
and not much of a surprise since we're getting the stupid Star Wars PSP over

329
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,000
here that Japan would get something a little bit cooler in the special Final

330
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,600
Fantasy 7 system set which will be coming out bundled with crisis core and

331
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:53,160
has some fancy Final Fantasy 7 crisis core artwork on it also it's gonna be a

332
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:01,440
limited production there are only making 77,777 units you know why that is right

333
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,160
because it's Final Fantasy 7 and it's not because 7 is the most powerful magic

334
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,240
number is beside that actually there was in Final Fantasy 7 if you got I've only

335
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,800
heard of this happening if you got your hit points all to seven then you did

336
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:24,240
some special attack for in the game the special attack was called go outside and

337
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,040
buy more sequels of this game when it comes out I'm gonna find it so I'm

338
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,480
looking I'm just looking at chat room now and going back to some old comments

339
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,480
here the Rob D says I want to see Maria and Kirby in a sing-off and the dark

340
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:44,920
no cuz no dark Tatsuya wants to add jigglypuff to that no Maria sings worse

341
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,140
than all of them let's see and chainsaw juggling said I did that once it was

342
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,160
awesome in reference to the lucky sevens there see I knew it was in there

343
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,880
drunami says seven seven seven HP send your character into a constant attack

344
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:07,320
mode yeah it's awesome all right well even though they are getting that super

345
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:14,040
cool Final Fantasy 7 slim thing PSP in Japan everybody is hopefully getting

346
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,120
this it's an expansion to Metal Gear Solid portable ops course a lot of folks

347
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,840
are big fans of this game on the PSP because it wasn't Metal Gear acid and it

348
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,960
was actually more like the other Metal Gear games a lot of folks are really

349
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:31,160
into this your acid though had the cool 3d thing I cool is relative and that

350
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,800
cooler headache inducing I know if I wear that thing too long I would

351
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,440
definitely have to take some Vicodin for the headaches I'm gonna be getting after

352
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,480
using that too much so there you go now IGN is actually reporting from the

353
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,080
PlayStation premiere event in Tokyo that this new portable ops game is going to

354
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,160
have some online play and that's going to be kind of its focus there's going to

355
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,600
be some new characters possibly an older version of snake and there's only going

356
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,080
to be a little bit more as far as the single-player mode goes the infinity

357
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,040
mission otherwise it's the good old-fashioned Metal Gear Solid

358
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,520
portable ops that you're used to they do have old snake from Metal Gear Solid 4 in

359
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,040
there he's in the trailer awesome September 20th is the day that comes out

360
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,080
hmm I seem to remember something else is coming out that day in Japan as well

361
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,680
there it is probably take a little bit longer for it to come out here though

362
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,000
because you know Konami hates you and they did some little thing in the yes

363
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,240
and they did something in the video where it's like Power Rangers for the

364
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,080
trailer that makes me want to play it now dang it well other stuff for anyone

365
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,040
who cares is that there is actually going to be a Metal Gear Solid online

366
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:47,680
for ps3 they had a little demo of it out when they did the Metal Gear Solid 4

367
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,760
thing so if anybody cares there you go you can all wander around with boxes

368
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,600
over your heads I get you know and your truck can start to move could Metal

369
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,800
Gear Solid ever be like a first-person shooter someday it was when do you

370
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:10,080
remember the VR missions they came out with a first-person version of metal in

371
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,680
Japan it did came out with the first person version of Metal Gear Solid it

372
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,040
just kind of makes me think like with all this like online and all that stuff

373
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,720
could this be like a new halo I don't know for a certain audience I don't know

374
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,960
it's a little silly I would say it's more like Splinter Cell or you know

375
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,600
recon some but I don't know I think I'd play it a lot if it was I know Metal

376
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,360
Gear Solid is one of those series but I don't get into the Tom Clancy games as

377
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,800
much I don't get into them I don't get into that stuff either like the old-ass

378
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,960
Metal Gear I used to love house does I don't I don't get into those games as

379
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,440
much although the solid I it would be kind of cool to implement that into our

380
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,600
website the what the solid I for the you know

381
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,880
Melger acid to that that freaking headache inducing thing the thing though

382
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,400
but it makes it 3d so I'd be kinda neat a little silly it would be jvmon says

383
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,160
first-person shooters suck though that's an opinion that's an opinion some of

384
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,240
them are fun some of them do suck but some are fun I love hexen I love like

385
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,680
quake 3 that game was badass and Duke Nukem 3d hello why do you think so many

386
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,920
people are crazy about doing them forever

387
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,120
blaze says correction halo sucks Gears of War is amazing see I don't know I

388
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,240
think I could not get into Gears of War at all so I could not get into it

389
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:36,320
I try crazy fun I tried so hard anyways so of course last week you know there's

390
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,160
a whole debacle about you know the 68 system being phased out in the 88 system

391
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,480
coming into place

392
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,640
well there's some interesting commentary about the whole thing coming from Sony

393
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,000
Computer Entertainment Europe's president David Reeves in fact he's

394
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,760
actually been on record saying you know the difference between 60 and 80

395
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,960
gigabytes is very small we're just we just feel like going up 20 gigabytes is

396
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,200
not worth it you're gonna double it then it's worth it so basically you know

397
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,520
obviously he's commenting on the fact that I don't think the 80 system is

398
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,800
coming to Europe I think they're going to be doing something a little bit

399
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,640
larger but at the same time you see oh by the way yeah you probably don't need

400
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,760
to buy it for another extra 20 why doesn't he just admit we don't have 20

401
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,600
gigs worth of shit for you to put on here there really is not that much stuff

402
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,520
to download that's what I don't get I you know if I would think it now I don't

403
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,040
know I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner and I haven't been reading up very well but

404
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,880
does the PlayStation 3 allow you to play movies like from your computer yeah it

405
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,880
does anything like any type of movie it's limited but you can play stuff from

406
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,200
your computer you copy them to the PlayStation 3 drive or anything you can't

407
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,640
download them from your networking copy him but you can download some on there

408
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,200
like I have a rip copy of kung pao on my hard drive that can play off there but

409
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,960
nothing officially endorsed by Sony I don't think there's any movies that you

410
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,100
can download from Sony like let's say on my xbox 360 I can watch wmv files of a

411
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,400
certain type over the network and watch them on my TV right yeah but on the Sony

412
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,600
I can do that with certain other types of movies yeah why doesn't Sony just

413
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,320
blow the door wide open on that and just leave it unlimited to what you get like

414
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,080
put all the different codex in there to what you can watch and people would like

415
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,120
love that and they could copy movies to their drive and everything I don't know

416
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,720
my guy absurd I never understood why they bumped it up from 60 80 anyways

417
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,400
because I guess unless you know a lot of games really install themselves onto the

418
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,120
drive like I remember Ridge Racer did that and the oblivion I know does that

419
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,640
but I haven't really I don't have that many PlayStation 3 games so I can't say

420
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,000
if they all do that but if they did all do that then yeah that would fill up

421
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,480
pretty quick but at the same time as far as downloadable content that's available

422
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,880
on their PlayStation Store there's hardly anything on there I mean I check

423
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,000
maybe once every few months and there may be one or two things more on there

424
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,200
they're actually worth downloading Ravens Dolphin says what Sony is telling

425
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,920
the truth for once and the Rob D says MPAA sky but the MPAA you know what they

426
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,400
can't control what if I have a video I shoot on my digital camera that I want

427
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,760
to watch over on the TV you know they can't control that F the MPAA you know

428
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,080
those comments coming from our chat room chat dot orange lounge radio.com

429
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,680
something else maybe that could be a downloadable title I don't know the

430
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,920
early screenshots I'm seeing that this game look very simplistic it's from the

431
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:37,040
creator of Katamari Dimashii Kata Takahashi you might remember he said he

432
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,800
was taking a break to work on playgrounds remember that like he was

433
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,500
supposedly ended konmari Dimashii to go make playgrounds well I don't know if he

434
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,940
finished or what's going on but he is released information about a new game

435
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:55,440
for the PlayStation 3 no B no B boy now no B means stretch in Japanese so in the

436
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,760
early screenshots definitely look like this big stretching I don't know turdie

437
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,380
caterpillar thing stretching around so there's very little information on this

438
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,700
is right now but we do know that the creator of Katamari Dimashii is making a

439
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,880
new game for the PlayStation 3 that's about it so that's kind of interesting

440
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,640
because you know a lot of folks on PlayStation 3 were really sad because

441
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,040
there has been no news about beautiful Katamari coming out to their system in

442
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,320
fact now it looks like that whole project may have been scrapped so maybe

443
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,920
they'll get this new project instead which could be somewhat redemption for

444
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,560
them I don't know kind of interesting I think they're beyond redemption they

445
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,800
deserve to burn no thinking speaking of things that deserve to burn is a Gran

446
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,680
Turismo prologue is going to be available for Japanese PlayStation

447
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:52,520
Network in October we don't get it yet it will have online multiplayer and has

448
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,200
an undetermined price it is not free great you get to pay for a demo that's

449
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:05,240
awesome I just say it's more freaking cars so whatever project Gotham is more

450
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,680
fun why don't you release an actual game instead of all these demos that's what I

451
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,440
think another game that's coming out to PlayStation 3 at least was announced a

452
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,280
Disgaea 3 looks very similar to all the other Disgaea games and sadly enough the

453
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,040
graphics also look similar to the other Disgaea games meaning that they're not

454
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,680
that great but hey it's Disgaea it's another game hurrah yeah Disgaea was

455
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,680
never really about the graphics though it was a hilarious voice acting in the

456
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,920
stories and you know the game itself it was pretty awesome strategy it looks

457
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,560
okay I mean I don't know I would think though that if they're gonna step up to

458
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,080
PlayStation 3 they're gonna do something with the graphics make them uber sharp

459
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,080
or you know it does look a little sharper but then again the screenshots

460
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:59,680
so small I don't really know well there you go also coming for the PlayStation

461
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:09,760
3 at some point someday Tekken 6 Tekken 6 is going to be coming up I'm sorry oh

462
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,800
Tekken 6 is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and of course you know

463
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,440
Virtua Fighter is going to have online on the Xbox 360 so it just makes sense

464
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,600
that Virtua Fighter sucks PlayStation should have something going for it and

465
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,920
that's going to be Tekken 6 Namco Bandai answered at PlayStation Premiere in

466
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,600
Tokyo that they will have the online capability you know I don't think that

467
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,520
these should really be announcements anymore I think it should always be an

468
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,120
online game I mean this is what we Microsoft doesn't go out there and out

469
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,480
hey this game is gonna be online most of the games are online it's not something

470
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:55,360
that you really need to announce just get with it Sony or hell get with it

471
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,680
Namco I mean you should yeah because when everything online it's not Sony's

472
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,600
fault there was this big to-do about Soul Calibur finally going online too

473
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,160
and everybody's just kind of like yeah the last one really should have been

474
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:14,800
online right so I don't know that's like saying you know you know Tekken 6 is

475
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,920
gonna be in high definition okay great I thought it was supposed to be since it's

476
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,840
on you know the PlayStation 3 all right well whatever whatever it is you're into

477
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:34,840
we know that Dark Sakura is into this it's her website of the week and every

478
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,920
week Dark Sakura surfs the internet up and down and back and forth and finds a

479
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,560
website suitable of sharing with all of you it's called Dark Sakura's website of

480
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:51,160
the week and here it is my website of the week because I couldn't concentrate

481
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,440

ceiling cat is very pleased with your offering next story please I don't get

496
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,080
that crap anyways it's not surprising we talked a little bit about this last week

497
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:32,120
there was a survey that went out to all the attendees of e3 this year kind of

498
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,360
asking them their opinions on certain things that they're possibly going to

499
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,520
change for next year of the following they were offering new locations

500
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:48,680
including Santa Monica San Diego Laguna Beach San Francisco or LA also they were

501
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,040
prefer our question was do you prefer to see the summit held in multiple hotel

502
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,920
settings like it was this year or a convention center type larger facility

503
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,560
setting I know I'll probably speak for Bobby insane larger facility convention

504
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,200
center type setting instead of having to drive between hotels and says also

505
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,120
they're talking about what month you like you know options included May

506
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:20,120
through August and then of course if you didn't visit Barker hangar or the

507
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,320
Fairmount Hotel why not I hope it comes to because I was stuck in traffic I

508
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,840
wasn't invited he'll get a link to the survey so we can fill out I wasn't

509
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:36,640
invited I didn't visit it because it's eight hours away too far although I did

510
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,560
not find it interesting that you one of the choices was San Francisco and you've

511
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,320
been begging and pleading for it to come to San Francisco's that way cuz you're

512
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,480
lazy and you don't have to you know flyer anything you could just drive

513
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:56,520
driver to LA for a convention I will I swear I'll only fly to LA ever again

514
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:03,400
because I hate that drive so horrible I drive great on that drive is the most

515
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,880
boring drive is pretty boring you probably take the five yeah five is

516
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,000
pretty boring but 99 is not much better 99 has great truck stops on the way and

517
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,760
you meet all kinds of colorful people it's like five is like field field field

518
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:23,400
field mountain field field field smell and cow like by what was it that Marissa

519
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,160
called it a cow shwits cow shwits the town of Kohling a beautiful stuff

520
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:36,000
anyway the Rob D is saying they've never driven in Illinois have they hostile

521
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,600
on her miss here the people in Illinois don't know how to drive at all son of

522
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:46,880
dad says e-308 in Vegas for the win I would not mind e-308 in Vegas I don't

523
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,760
think Vegas would work oh why not but it's Vegas well they just did was it the

524
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:02,480
ESA thing there or EMA camera what is the video kind of their big convention

525
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,880
in Vegas and it sucks in Vegas everything's way expensive and act deaf

526
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:17,080
says e3 in Mexicali Mexico hell yeah e3 in Mexico let's have it in Tijuana that

527
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:23,920
would rock I'm gonna go to Mexico this year for what world pump finals they

528
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,360
moved it out of Korea this year and they're putting it in Mexico so I'm

529
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,200
gonna have to you know bring soap and something to keep the dirtiness away and

530
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,360
a water filter horrible and a water you guys are horrible I'm sure those

531
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:44,760
stereotypes are not true it's always gamer day at Easter Island it's so

532
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,440
fitting mmm blaze says e3 in Canada so Rob can get more maple cookies I like

533
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,840
that idea e3 in Canada requires leaving nothing

534
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,920
against Canada but they're not gonna have anything up there ever they have

535
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,520
red PlayStations I live Canada I wouldn't to Brad I will take California

536
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:10,800
drivers over Alabama drivers any day all right Florida drivers may I move on may

537
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,240
I do a new story no no one thing you might remember we were all giddy about

538
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,080
on this program about a year ago was the Silent Hill movie remember Silent Hill

539
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,040
came out we were all excited because his pyramid had like right there it's not

540
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,840
four times you know he cut the shit out of people and rip that lady's skin off

541
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,160
it was awesome and so of course we were excited about a Silent Hill 2 coming out

542
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,600
but now I don't know how excited this is gonna make people about Silent Hill 2

543
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,560
because Christoph Ganz has said I'm sorry I don't have the time to do Silent

544
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:47,640
Hill 2 so he's not gonna be doing this is good news to you yes why cuz I didn't

545
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,800
think he did a great job with the first one that's all right you know what you

546
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,240
know who's wrapping up filming on Far Cry ooh a bowl yeah god I hope he's

547
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,320
available somebody just needs to shoot that man in the head yeah careful what

548
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,960
you have to understand in Silent Hill now will be setting will be setting the

549
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,760
jungle on an island so be a rave there someone needs to strap that man down and

550
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,200
lobotomize the section of his brain that controls writing movies oh wait they

551
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,240
already did that explains his last few movies well anyway since Christoph Ganz

552
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,000
is not on the next film Roger Avery took a hike as well now see what's going on

553
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,240
is that Ganz has said to a French magazine DVD Rama that the sequel was

554
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,720
ordered by Sony but he's kind of too busy with other movies like Onimusha

555
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,480
which he's adapting that game as well obviously um so he can't do it he said

556
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,320
this quote if I cannot take on Silent Hill 2 myself the director who does

557
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,900
would need to continue in the same style as the first film and then make you

558
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,520
excited Jane one does not want that crappy did get the style right one does

559
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,360
not want to make a Hollywood style movie and I think that it makes sense if the

560
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:01,840
director of the sequel is European in the best case scenario French so there

561
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:07,000
it is and Roger Avery said if I'm not gonna do Silent Hill 2 if Christoph's

562
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,960
not gonna do it that's fine we don't need them they just go the way of the

563
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,720
Resident Evil movies I know Resident Evil is bad because they don't really

564
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,880
follow well anything it's kind of gone on its own tangent but it'd be cool like

565
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,680
if Silent Hill kind of took over the world and then you have people trying to

566
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,960
survive all these mutated evil things not everybody enjoyed the Silent Hill

567
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,000
movie though I know a lot of people did and I liked it those well then they can

568
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,760
just make a sequel from me exactly they should have me write it it's just it

569
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,000
just stars pyramid head seriously they should have me where I will write it's

570
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,080
pyramid head gone wild honestly they just need to look at the second game and

571
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,360
then take the dialogue and then add some scenes where the action takes place and

572
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,360
there you got you got your second movie but what I don't want it to turn into is

573
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,700
I don't want Silent Hill Silent Hill series to turn into like the Halloween

574
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,860
series where it's just like pyramid head kills everything you know a pyramid head

575
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:04,540
at summer camp killing lovely young ladies now if they wanted to spin off

576
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,600
series I'm all fine with that Freddy versus Jason versus pyramid head oh you

577
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,740
know they both die cuz pyramid heads awesome I'll be awesome because nobody

578
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,860
can kill a pyramid head he has to end up offing himself

579
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,960
son of dad says a Luca Besson Silent Hill would own wasn't he the guy that

580
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,120
did the fifth element I'd be pretty hot that would be hot hmm maybe maybe we

581
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:38,060
shall see Bruce Willis as pyramid head no Bruce Willis versus pyramid head that

582
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:44,120
would be fun cuz then no John McLean versus pyramid head cuz nobody would

583
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:49,280
die hard fun they just take out the whole fucking world between them okay so

584
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,080
so I guess what else keep speaking of you know weird bizarreness that episode

585
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,600
is South Park where they did the World of Warcraft thing which I finally saw

586
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:08,440
two days ago is up for an Emmy glad she's on top of it I don't watch TV I

587
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:14,080
have to either be really bored or high on Vicodin to watch TV and I was high

588
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,480
as a kite on okay for to explain to people who are listening I broke two

589
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,520
ribs so I'm currently medicated so that's why I sound like a goofball

590
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:29,080
tonight and I was bored enough tonight hey shut up and I was I was so bored

591
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,400
that I decided to watch the South Park episode of World of Warcraft what the

592
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,560
other way around you know what I mean did live up to your expectations it was

593
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,400
kind of funny but there was stuff that was wrong but I did think it was your

594
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,800
son's character is going to die I was like oh shit bathroom bathroom I know

595
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,480
people who get like that is so stupid so I thought it was funny but so does it

596
00:47:52,480 --> 00:48:00,960
deserve an Emmy no what's the Emmy for I don't know this is nominated for one

624
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,880
just don't like the controls at all I think it's a cute game and it's

625
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,720
definitely Ella bits ish but it's it's not fun to set the Wii's problem or is

626
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,880
that the game's problem because I noticed a lot of it's not the Wii's

627
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,680
problem I mean this could have been done with a 6-axis too I just don't think the

628
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,640
last time I played it the controls were tight enough also coming out in Japan

635
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,840
the PlayStation 3 shit I want to practically import that game I was

636
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,320
awesome I love the arcade series screenshots for that and I thought that

637
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,520
was kind of interesting it looks like it's the first game though I don't know

638
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,240
how would you practically import it like just get the instruction book well cuz

639
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,800
PlayStation 3 is free order with all sorts of practicality like if I'm gonna

640
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,000
rationalize getting a PlayStation 3 that's one of the games that would

641
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,960
actually make me want to do it because I love that I don't know if it's region

642
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,320
free for the games though that's the only thing god damn it I'm not sure well

643
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,000
hold well this I thought it was region free for games not from the site says no

644
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,120
region protection well then awesome I'm gonna have to import that fuck yeah oh

645
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:28,120
yeah well me too well fuck yeah twice uh-huh anyway I don't want to fuck yeah

646
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:34,000
twice PlayStation 2 is getting a lot of stuff going into best hits but they're

647
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,080
getting some new games as well I believe this is new ikki tosen shining dragon is

648
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:45,480
coming out and then also the metal gear 20th anniversary collection metal gear

649
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,400
solid 2 Metal Gear Solid 3 and another your solid collection is all coming out

650
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,520
PlayStation our Phantasy Star Universe takes a price cut as it moves into the

651
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,800
best series and sanyo pachinko paradise 14 oh also another another game goes

652
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,560
into Sega ages this would be volume 30 galaxy force 2 in Japan you big fan of

653
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:13,280
galaxy force no I don't know Nintendo DS is getting a lot of games as well this

654
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,720
is a big release week for games over there a Taiko no Tatujin on the DS is

655
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:23,280
coming out over there and also this is great another Hello Kitty game this one

656
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:30,360
is called Hello Kitty no I shot a party Sanrio characters Zuka and DS isn't that

657
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,720
a mouthful it's an action game but it has all your favorite Hello Kitty

658
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:39,000
characters I see twin star I see kiropi but I don't see bats Maru so this game

659
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,600
fails let's see if there's anything on the PSP real quick alexa silvara and the

660
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,720
charm says Wangen midnight equals maximum tune to now not necessarily the

661
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,240
box art doesn't say its maximum tune to it just calls it when again mid get

662
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,640
midnight it's all-encompassing I don't know if it's all-encompassing or what it

663
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,280
is I would be the ideal I would think on the PlayStation 3 also look at more

664
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,320
information on this game with that up during the oh you looking that up right

665
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,960
now well I was looking at it is region free so it's not that expensive either

666
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,000
which is good I'm just like I don't know if it's all in Japanese or something

667
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,600
because some of those games can actually be in English as well I just I don't

668
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,240
have any careful well on the Sony PSP you finally get Grand Theft Auto Liberty

669
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,600
City Stories in Japan Capcom is bringing that to you I always think that's

670
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,240
interesting how that works intercontinental there how different

671
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,720
companies can bring the games see because the other game that I would like

672
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:40,160
to get also maybe would be folks all you know like folklore that's gonna be

673
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,760
coming over here well that's all I got for Japanese releases maybe I can get

674
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,440
well I have some European releases but only a few we have guilty your dust

675
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,800
strikers on DS guilty your judgment on PSP and they're finally getting the

676
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:02,920
pokey man's diamond and pearl which was also a print album I'm done wow I was

677
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:09,320
quick there's other games listed with with uh to be announced titles but you

678
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,800
know there's nothing really specific which I would assume that some of these

679
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,480
would already be out I would hope like Saints Row is listed for ps3 okay here's

680
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,320
the deal with Wangan midnight and all that is that I'm looking at Wikipedia

681
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,680
and apparently this is actually the third game in the series so this would

682
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,720
be like Wangan midnight maximum tune 3 it's going to be a simultaneous release

683
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:38,680
in the arcade PlayStation 3 and PSP hell yeah there it is that's pretty rad sign

684
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:44,440
me up that might be I might try that wouldn't it be amazing if they did that

685
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:50,200
for like a good series you don't like that game I don't care about I never

686
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,920
played it you've never played it then how can you knock it because the track

687
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,960
is amazing that's there I can knock it for that it's got a poetry song on it

688
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:05,240
why don't you know it's usual Shiro is she like getting one of the throat in it

689
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,680
maybe I doubt it it sounds like that in every song she sings I know but I doubt

690
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:16,600
it see drunami sets miklotov on fire in shed SSG 100 says lol Shane's being a

713
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,200
bag very shortly here and I read the avalanche of emails that came into our

714
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:11,960
mailbox this week at mail bag at orange everybody but first this was a big story

715
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,680
here Peter Moore has left Microsoft that's right Peter Moore has been

716
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,600
become very well known lately it's kind of like the face of Microsoft and a lot

717
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,360
of these events and of course Peter Moore came to Microsoft from Sega which

718
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,440
drew all these comparisons about the Xbox 360 launch versus the Dreamcast

719
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,120
launch and so on well Peter Moore is actually left to move back to the Bay

720
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:37,160
Area so welcome back Peter Moore even though we're not technically in the Bay

721
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:41,120
Area we're close enough Peter Moore has come back to the Bay Area to be with his

722
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:47,240
family so what he's gonna do now he's going to head up EA Sports is what his

723
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,280
new role is going to be so even though he's gone from working for a giant you

724
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,220
know console maker to a publisher that's still nothing to blink at that's still a

725
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:59,840
very important role EA makes crap loads of money and if you're wondering who is

726
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:04,720
going to replace Peter Moore well it's going to be Don Matrick who comes from

727
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:12,160
EA he's coming from EA there you go and will be interesting to see if this has

728
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:17,600
any type of changes on Microsoft's PR but probably not probably not really

729
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:23,680
gonna be the same old stuff see a son of dad says Peter Moore quit to go work at

730
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,240
showbiz you know it's funny you know where Reggie Fils-Aime came from you

731
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,600
know one of the places he worked before he was at Nintendo Pizza Time Theatre

732
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:38,680
no Panda Express really yeah but I mean look at you know Panda Express is nasty

733
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,760
but it's everywhere now it's insanely popular so I don't know if that was his

734
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,520
doing or what but there you go no it was the doing it was people addicted to MSG

735
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:53,080
maybe all right anyhow I'll see we mentioned the mailbags coming up so

759
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,640
Blizzcon right there but unfortunately because of the move and everything it's

760
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:54,160
it's too close to the finances for me probably doesn't help also that all the

761
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,040
tickets sold out within like a few hours that didn't help either and I was out of

762
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,920
town when they went on sale otherwise I might have bought one oh well so they

763
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,920
had interesting to see me go to Blizzcon because I have no interest in World of

764
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,720
Warcraft drunami says if we hang out with Wow radio we should say hi to total

765
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,720
biscuit I don't know who that is but I'm sure somebody listening does so there

766
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:19,680
total biscuit can I read the next you may okay hey olr crew it's me necky sorry I

767
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,280
haven't emailed in a while but I've been really busy been loving the show

768
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,640
recently by the way warning this might be really long no I've got longer sorry

769
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:33,600
you don't quite meet the the longest email category I've seen longer I've seen

770
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:40,120
plenty longer I've seen thicker can I read please yes you perverted people

771
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:45,440
what I was talking about emails shut up boo-hoo my 360 died earlier this week

772
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,800
and although it's a pain in the ass Microsoft is very good at cleaning this

773
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,880
up I had to I had to phone twice second because I forgot my original mobile no

774
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,280
but I was only on hold for a best ten minutes each call so things should go to

775
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,960
Microsoft for their good support the extended warranty shows that they are

776
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:08,200
taking responsibility for it so I am understanding however dot dot dot dot

777
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:12,880
dot dot the expected time I will get my Burke 360 back is over one month also

778
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,320
did Microsoft say they have fixed the problem with the new Xbox 360s if so I

779
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:23,720
intended to shell out for a new 360 instead the good point to my 360 dying

780
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:29,440
is that I finally have dug out my old ps2 some of the games seem unusually

781
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,280
unusual now and look bad graphics another thing is that the PlayStation

782
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,160
controller seemed tiny if using the Xbox 360 controllers alone for five to six

783
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:43,160
months dude you want to see tiny try playing with a dual analog controller

784
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:48,760
for the Saturn and everything will look tiny to you trust me also a note on an

785
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,240
email last week I fully support younger online players who are online I am now

786
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:58,960
15 I can truthfully say that I am definitely more mature than than other

787
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,760
even 30 year old players who use the n-word and anyway I'm not going to let

788
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,160
this go on really long so by necky PS this is good

789
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,240
gramming speller lol's I'm not well I could point them out but I'm not going

790
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,840
to because I'm not I'm too doped up to be a bitch tonight and PBS look for me

791
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,320
in the chat room I saw you there I was gonna say something hi necky you're so

792
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:26,140
lying you didn't look I did no I even voiced him all right and necky is one of

793
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:29,520
our listeners from the UK so to be in our chat room right now dude your

794
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,320
parents know you're up oh there was a question there but the Xbox 360 and and

795
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:39,100
having three well have they fixed the problem on Xbox 360 I believe they have

796
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,460
didn't they change the chips that were on in the Xbox 360 as part of to change

797
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:49,060
that problem Loki am I wrong they didn't change chips they changed the heatsinks

798
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:54,240
that were on the graphics chips and stuff and all the new ones um have been

799
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,880
are being fixed I guess so then the new system shouldn't have this problem

800
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,000
theoretically unless there's something else that goes wrong all right well

801
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:09,280
we'll see what happens so that's it for email yes right right email the Rob D

802
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,680
and chat confirms they changed the heatsinks so heat distribution is

803
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,760
different there you go I have an email you have an email yeah I got it right

804
