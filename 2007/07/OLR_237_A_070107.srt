00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:24,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, July 1st, 2007, Soul Calibur IV goes online, the world of Civilization comes to consoles, and are achievements about to get product placements?

2
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,052
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:43,412
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:44,593
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know me as Sky.

6
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:48,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Not joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:49,254
[SPEAKER_03]: She has the night off.

8
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:55,616
[SPEAKER_03]: As many of you long-time listeners of the show may know, she's been very active in taking up massage therapy.

9
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,937
[SPEAKER_03]: She has a little bit of a conflict with her schooling tonight.

10
00:00:57,997 --> 00:00:59,137
[SPEAKER_03]: But the show must go on.

11
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And joining me as always, say hello to Loki.

12
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:02,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

13
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:03,546
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Loki?

14
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:04,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing okay.

15
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:06,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I just scoffed down a sandwich.

16
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:09,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you had like a large Quiznos.

17
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,609
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like a regular size.

18
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:10,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it?

19
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:12,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a regular size.

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a balancing act with the sandwich, and also it is spicy, so it's like, you know.

21
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:19,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Spicy sandwich.

22
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:21,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Regular size Black Angus steak sandwich.

23
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,095
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, there you have it.

24
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:23,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yum, yum.

25
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:27,457
[SPEAKER_03]: But not that we endorse any particular commercial products here on this program.

26
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:28,498
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

27
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:29,582
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

28
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:55,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, thanks.

29
00:01:56,058 --> 00:01:56,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

30
00:01:56,358 --> 00:02:02,082
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to tell Rice Princess how you're doing, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

31
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:05,505
[SPEAKER_03]: We do tape live here on Sunday nights at orangeloungeradio.com.

32
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rice Princess will just be helping us get a third perspective tonight.

33
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pretty much.

34
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But also the chat room is there as always to give us a million more perspectives.

35
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:15,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're right.

36
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:17,534
[SPEAKER_03]: As if we actually had a million people in the chat room.

37
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:19,355
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the best thing ever.

38
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not in the chat room.

39
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:22,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Four or five different opinions in the chat.

40
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:23,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

41
00:02:23,798 --> 00:02:24,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Over and over.

42
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:33,859
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow, let's start off tonight's show with a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week, where we talk about what we've been playing this week.

43
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:36,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I guess you're going to start us off tonight.

44
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:36,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

45
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this week I've been playing some interesting things.

46
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:46,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Some have actually, you know, people have been questioning why I'm playing them, like the Transformers game, for one.

47
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:48,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing that on 360.

48
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:56,581
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay, it's kind of like, I like the game like, um, I like Driver 3.

49
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:05,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a poorly put together game, and it has some blatant flaws in it, but it's, it's okay, it's just I play it.

50
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:06,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, the same type of graphical stuff?

51
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:10,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me put it, put some examples in place here.

52
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:19,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I first started the game, immediately there was a big pileup of cars in the street because they couldn't figure out how to turn the corner correctly.

53
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:21,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that was kind of funny.

54
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:28,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is, if you throw anything at anything in the game, you know, pretty much like, you can throw a road cone at a building.

55
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:34,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what happens is, when you hit something with said road cone, shrapnel comes off the building.

56
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:41,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that shrapnel hits another building, and then more shrapnel comes off that building, and sometimes it goes back to the original building.

57
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:47,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you can literally destroy an entire block by just throwing a road cone at something.

58
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:50,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of fascinating at the same time.

59
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:55,246
[SPEAKER_03]: First comment of the night, DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, Loki, testers not doing their job?

60
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:56,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course not.

61
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,650
[SPEAKER_03]: It was definitely a rushed game.

62
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:06,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it that testers aren't doing their job, or is it that testing gets their corners cut because the game has a strict deadline of trying to be out in time for the movie?

63
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably corners cut.

64
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,341
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I figured.

65
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:12,254
[SPEAKER_02]: But other stuff that's kind of crappy in the game.

66
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:17,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the very first boss that I fought in the Autobots campaign killed himself.

67
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:21,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Suicide man.

68
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:27,179
[SPEAKER_02]: We were fighting in this, like, I don't even know what it's supposed to be, like a power plant or something like that.

69
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:34,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have all these explosive, like, I guess, I don't know, propane tanks or something all around.

70
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:37,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, you set off one, the whole place goes up.

71
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:37,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

72
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,042
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

73
00:04:55,442 --> 00:05:02,246
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of our chatters are big fans of Transformers, looking forward to the movie, and I understand you actually got to see a little sneak peek of the movie.

74
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I got to see the movie last Wednesday.

75
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:04,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

76
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:05,407
[SPEAKER_02]: How was it?

77
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:06,027
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dying to know.

78
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,988
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking awesome.

79
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:08,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

80
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:08,969
[SPEAKER_02]: What was awesome about it?

81
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:14,271
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome because the action in the movie is just non-stop throughout the thing.

82
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:22,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar to Independence Day, how it jumps back and forth between different character story arcs and stuff like that.

83
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:33,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got that, plus, you know, in the beginning of the movie, when, like, Scorponok comes out and stuff, fucking spears a guy through the chest and pulls him into the ground.

84
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there, I was like, fuck yeah, this is gonna be awesome.

85
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:36,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, any spoilers?

86
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:39,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there is a couple spoilers I was gonna mention.

87
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:41,450
[SPEAKER_02]: These are kind of cameos towards the end of the movie.

88
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that rumor going around that there was gonna be an Xbox 360 robot in the movie?

89
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:46,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

90
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:53,037
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, briefly, a cameo, because, um, the AllSpark, whatever, causes things to come alive.

91
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:53,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

92
00:05:53,497 --> 00:06:08,523
[SPEAKER_02]: and so one of the things that happens to get set off by this is a 360, so you see this guy carrying it out of, I don't know if it was a GameStop or something, but, you know, it busts out the side, just for, you know, half a second, then there's a Mountain Dew Machine robot, which is funny, shooting cans at people, so...

93
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:12,907
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a brief little cameos there, but it was an excellent movie.

94
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:14,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly recommend it if you like action movies.

95
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:19,711
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for a deep storyline or something like that, you're not going to find it here, but it was good.

96
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:28,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, unfortunately we're radio and not television, so you can't really see everything that goes on here in studio, but Rice Princess is making her patented Laura Roslin face.

97
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:34,383
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Laura Roslyn face is, if you've ever watched Battlestar Galactica, you know, what's the actress's name?

98
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:35,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary McDonald, is that it?

99
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:36,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what it is, yeah.

100
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:46,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, like, you know, the actress, she has this, whenever something negative happens, she has this very distinct look where she kind of scrunches up her nose and her mouth and, like, Irene or Rice Princess has that look down pat.

101
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:49,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So when she's displeased with something, it's the Laura Roslyn look.

102
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:52,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So why are you giving this review the Laura Roslyn look?

103
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the Xbox...

104
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:55,198
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

105
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:25,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, Microsoft.

106
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:26,590
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even show the 360.

107
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,073
[SPEAKER_02]: All they show is the white premium box and an arm punch out the side.

108
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that's it, and the guy drops it.

109
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:35,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's there for literally one to two seconds.

110
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I would drop it, too.

111
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:40,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught it, you know, real briefly, but a lot of people probably won't even notice it.

112
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not detract from the film whatsoever.

113
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:45,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like, let's call Xbox 360 robot.

114
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:46,644
[SPEAKER_02]: He will defeat everybody.

115
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:49,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not anything like that at all, so...

116
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:55,568
[SPEAKER_03]: He will charge you 800 Microsoft points for every projectile that he throws.

117
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good movie.

118
00:07:58,669 --> 00:07:59,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.

119
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:00,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait to see it again.

120
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep forgetting that Rice Princess is really anti-Xbox and Microsoft.

121
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Remind me again real quick.

122
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:12,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not super anti-Xbox and Microsoft.

123
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:12,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not.

124
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,514
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know much about Microsoft to really hate them.

125
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:16,874
[SPEAKER_01]: I just

126
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:18,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't prefer them.

127
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:21,167
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very underwhelming to me.

128
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you tell me it has to do really with the games that they offer, though?

129
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,328
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.

130
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:28,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very underwhelmed because they don't have anything to offer to me.

131
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing appeals to me on that system.

132
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:36,252
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to see the Eternal Sonata demo, though, if you haven't yet, because that seems like a Japanese RPG.

133
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:40,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I have actually seen it, and it does look really pretty, and I would totally play it.

134
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Blue Dragon in the future?

135
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:45,316
[SPEAKER_03]: She made the Rosalind face like a second.

136
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:46,296
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting so good at that.

137
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

138
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:49,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been practicing for a long time.

139
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:51,019
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I don't know.

140
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dragon might be cool.

141
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:54,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

142
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:54,521
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

143
00:08:55,082 --> 00:08:57,083
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely the other one looked really good.

144
00:08:58,904 --> 00:08:59,184
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

145
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:00,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's see.

146
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:03,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Ross Steel UT seems to agree with you in chat room.

147
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360 is all first-person shooter.

148
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:07,509
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not all first-person shooter.

149
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,172
[SPEAKER_03]: He also says, listen to Loki blindly defend a shitty unrelated marketing ploy.

150
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:18,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a blatant, but the whole movie has blatant, you know, product placement everywhere.

151
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:21,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, a fucking Mountain Dew robot, you know.

152
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:23,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough movie chat, game chat.

153
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:25,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to interrupt your gaming week, but anyways.

154
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:25,471
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

155
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:35,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So, other than that, actually, when Nellie, I bought Nellie the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix for the Wii, which I might add that has the worst cameras ever.

156
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever in a game is so awful.

157
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,652
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, she likes it.

158
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:41,733
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, Harry Potter.

159
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:43,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she actually finished it.

160
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:45,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot that was out.

161
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:47,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really like cast spells with the Wiimote and everything?

162
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:48,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

163
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:49,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

164
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,941
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the whole game, I mean, it sounds fun.

165
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:55,104
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to cast spells and stuff, but the whole game is doing tasks for people.

166
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:59,288
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like running around this stupid place and doing, you know, meaningless tasks.

167
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:01,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I've lost my stuff.

168
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,471
[SPEAKER_02]: People have hidden it somewhere in Hogwarts.

169
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:04,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Go find it.

170
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:22,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you for giving me no hints whatsoever, and Hogwarts isn't exactly small, so, you know, it takes a lot of time, and there's also a lot of things where if you forget what you're supposed to be doing, you go back and ask them, they won't give you any hints to what you're supposed to do or something like that, and a lot of the puzzles are hard to figure out what they want you to do.

171
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:24,541
[SPEAKER_01]: What a bunch of fuckers.

172
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:24,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

173
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:40,586
[SPEAKER_02]: The combat in the game, using the wand and stuff, is pretty stupid, because Nellie didn't really have a grasp on any sort of strategy, so she's just swinging the wand around, or the remote, I guess, around like crazy, and it won every battle.

174
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, whatever.

175
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,930
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's cool if you love Harry Potter, you'll definitely like the game.

176
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would recommend, though, probably don't get it on the Wii, maybe get it on the 360.

177
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,511
[SPEAKER_02]: or the PlayStation 3.

178
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Wiimote waving for your spells is not all that.

179
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:57,652
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not all that.

180
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:12,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I think, I'm not sure if the second, if in the normal, like the 360 and the PlayStation 3, if you use the other analog stick as, you know, maybe a camera look or something, but I know in the Wii version, it was hard to even face in the right direction for, you know, certain things.

181
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you'd be facing at what you want to cast a spell at, pull out your wand and you'd turn around.

182
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, you know, it's like, come on.

183
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:20,581
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what the hell?

184
00:11:20,661 --> 00:11:21,942
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks cool.

185
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:30,409
[SPEAKER_02]: The other games I've been playing on the PSP, actually Wipeout Pulse, which is not out over here in the US yet, but it's okay.

186
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:31,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like Wipeout.

187
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played a lot of Wipeout Pure before, and it's very similar to that.

188
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:37,959
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks actually almost like a PlayStation 2 game.

189
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty awesome, so that's going to be coming out in September.

190
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:47,944
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game I've been playing is Final Fantasy, the remake on the PSP, and that's actually really awesome looking.

191
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:52,247
[SPEAKER_03]: You showed that to me, and I played it for about 15 seconds, and I'm so fucking sold on it.

192
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,188
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is freaking gorgeous.

193
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,730
[SPEAKER_03]: The screenshots don't do it justice.

194
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,371
[SPEAKER_03]: The game looks so beautiful.

195
00:11:58,431 --> 00:11:59,051
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.

196
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:00,492
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just amazing.

197
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:03,274
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually going to get married, me and the game.

198
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:04,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You and Final Fantasy are going to get married?

199
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,795
[SPEAKER_01]: We totally are.

200
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,956
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already discussed this.

201
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:12,578
[SPEAKER_02]: The last game I was playing was a game called Zainide Revolution, I think.

202
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:20,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a sequel to an Xbox shooter game, like one of the shoot-em-ups that came out probably very late in the Xbox lifecycle.

203
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:23,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of different.

204
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:25,485
[SPEAKER_02]: This one now is a 3D shooter.

205
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,126
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of going towards the screen, I guess.

206
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:29,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

207
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:43,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still, you know, got the shoot-em-up aspect stuff in the game, but it's, you know, after seeing, you know, games that are free, like No Gravity and stuff, I'm sorry that, you know, the background of the whole game is just a full motion video and you can see artifacts and stuff.

208
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,344
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not very good when, you know, a free game like No Gravity does everything in real time and it looks amazing for no money.

209
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:53,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I, you know, I'd probably hold off on buying that, but...

210
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:56,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool, though.

211
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:59,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely get Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II when those come out.

212
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:00,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome games.

213
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:02,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

214
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:02,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go next.

215
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:05,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Rice Princess, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

216
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

217
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:12,551
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my quite substantial gaming week that consists of

218
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:15,189
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

219
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:42,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you on this show?

220
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:43,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know.

221
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:45,325
[SPEAKER_01]: To cuss a lot.

222
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:46,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

223
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,226
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to be creating a twink guild.

224
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,167
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a twink guild?

225
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've had this discussion on a previous show.

226
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:56,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go to the porno-related side of this.

227
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:56,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tell us straight up.

228
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,010
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this guild all about?

229
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,131
[SPEAKER_01]: The guild's all about PvP.

230
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:02,512
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing Morsangulch and Narathi Basin.

231
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:08,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to stay at level 29 because it's like, you know, so we can do AB and it's like the first one we can do it at.

232
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:09,923
[SPEAKER_01]: and Twinks.

233
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows what Twinks are.

234
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:18,464
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just the really like super awesome like characters that have all the best gear and all the best enchants and all that stuff and

235
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:19,391
[SPEAKER_01]: BattleStarGalactica

236
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:47,953
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Lee Adama.

237
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:48,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Lee Adama?

238
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:50,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you nerd!

239
00:14:50,118 --> 00:14:51,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Lee Adama's mine.

240
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:52,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

241
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:52,824
[SPEAKER_01]: You shut up.

242
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:56,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's going to be Tyrell because he's hot and sexy and nobody likes him except for me.

243
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:58,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, whatever, I'll take his name.

244
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else do we have in our PvP guild?

245
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:03,111
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.

246
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:03,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

247
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure there's a Roslyn.

248
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there is a Roslyn.

249
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:13,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of our guilds said they wanted to be a real bitch, so we said do Admiral Kane.

250
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:16,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, oh my god, isn't that the best thing ever?

251
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:17,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

252
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:17,897
[SPEAKER_01]: She's my hero.

253
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:21,398
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much it on my end of the gaming week.

254
00:15:23,218 --> 00:15:24,439
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

255
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:33,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Ross Steel, UTSM Advice, Rice Princess, you might have time to game if you didn't upset over that useless time sink.

256
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:37,314
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, stop playing WoW and get out of the games.

257
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:38,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.

258
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:39,756
[SPEAKER_01]: That was hilarious.

259
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:41,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're never going to get away from WoW, huh?

260
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:42,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, no.

261
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:44,158
[SPEAKER_03]: She's giving you a Rosalind face.

262
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:45,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

263
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:48,160
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week actually, sadly, was pretty similar.

264
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play a whole lot outside of WoW, but I have a good reason because I was out of town for three days.

265
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:53,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in L.A.

266
00:15:53,924 --> 00:16:03,389
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of – I had to do this thing for work where we were kind of – we stayed all together for this team-building thing away from the society, so I couldn't even get out to an arcade or a bar or anything, so –

267
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

268
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:40,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Survivor, like the TV show, I've been playing Survivor on LiveJournal Imagine like, you know, because a lot of people play Dungeons & Dragons online So there's Survivor on LiveJournal, so I'm playing that And I wasn't the first voted out, thank God So, there you go So, I was very happy about that

269
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:42,209
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

270
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:18,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I was kind of having, I was dishing out PSP Uncertainty because, like, there wasn't really, again, it was kind of like the Xbox.

271
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:26,381
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing that was really appealing to me except for Luminous, you know, but now I'm seeing all these games and I'm totally going to invest in one.

272
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:29,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, thought I'd interject that.

273
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:31,143
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

274
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, let's see.

275
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:40,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we've gone through our gaming weeks, perhaps we should get into some housekeeping tonight and tell you guys about what's going on with us.

276
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:46,930
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to be making an appearance at SAC for Sacramento Anime.

277
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,854
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be going to that convention, which is, I believe, two weeks off.

278
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to be making an appearance on Saturday the 14th.

279

[SPEAKER_03]: and for those of you that are in the Sacramento area it's at that hotel that's across Martin Fair Mall all the details we will have next week we're still trying to work that out with the folks and I need to make sure even all of us are available or else it's only going to be some of us however

280
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:14,611
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not be taping one of our live usual shows at this convention as we did for Fanime.

281
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:22,818
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be recording a special bonus show that only folks on the LiveJournal, the MySpace, our communities will be able to direct download.

282
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:24,839

[SPEAKER_03]: You'd think I'd just learned English this week.

287
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,891
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is going on?

288
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:41,691
[SPEAKER_03]: You did.

289
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:42,451
[SPEAKER_01]: You did.

290
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:43,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez.

291
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:46,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, because last week was the five-year anniversary and all.

292
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:49,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this week, we're just set up for disappointment.

293
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:50,515
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, who gives a fuck anniversary?

294
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:51,755
[SPEAKER_03]: How did we top last week?

295
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:52,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

296
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:53,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Who gives a fuck anymore?

297
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:54,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised we're here.

298
00:18:54,676 --> 00:19:00,038
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're at the top, you've got to have to bring it down a notch and gradually go down a bit so that you can bring it back up.

299
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:04,280
[SPEAKER_03]: For 250, because 250 is a landmark number, so you have to bring it up again for that.

300
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally right.

301
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:06,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

302
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:07,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Canada Day!

303
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:30,975
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

304
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:54,785
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting a cat.

305
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying an Apple product, ever.

306
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:57,086
[SPEAKER_02]: An iPhone?

307
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:58,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

308
00:19:58,387 --> 00:19:59,928
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our friends got an iPhone.

309
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,669
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty sexy.

310
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,430
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bringing sexy back.

311
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:08,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Just knowing Apple, there'll be something even better next year, so I'm going to hold off, and hopefully I'll have money because I'm moving soon.

312
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:13,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, also, the countdown is beginning for the last shows in this studio.

313
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:18,182
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be moving to a new room because I'm moving to a new place, and hopefully a bigger studio.

314
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:18,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

315
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:48,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you already named it?

316
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:50,891
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we didn't name it.

317
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a foster cat right now.

318
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:58,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a foster home, so we are going to be picking it up on Friday of this next week.

319
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:03,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Jake Simmons says, name it Kitty Bobo, and RawSteelUT says, name it Tingle.

320
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't name it Tingle.

321
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,648
[SPEAKER_02]: It responds to Stella.

322
00:21:08,688 --> 00:21:10,229
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see about nicknames.

323
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:11,951
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

324
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:15,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I wanted to mention this real quickly.

325
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:20,639
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be hearing this a lot, especially those of you guys that listen to a variety of podcasts.

326
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:28,385
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really going to get sick of hearing this after this month is over, so we're really only going to say this once, but it is that time of year.

327
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:33,069
[SPEAKER_03]: The podcast awards are open and nominations have started as of today.

328
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:37,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, we would be tickled pink if we could get nominated again this year for

329
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:38,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

330
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:01,851
[SPEAKER_03]: All we really want to see is the independent podcasts prevail in this.

331
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:06,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And last year, even though we weren't nominated, we were very happy to see that five independent podcasts were nominated.

332
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:08,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we want to keep it.

333
00:22:08,054 --> 00:22:08,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know what, guys?

334
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:15,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Those podcasts that are owned by the corporates and the big game companies and the big gaming magazines, they don't need the exposure.

335
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,219
[SPEAKER_03]: They have...

336
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:19,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of ad dollars that go into their print, their TV.

337
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:20,825
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need the exposure.

338
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:23,847
[SPEAKER_03]: But the independent folks, a podcast award can really help them out.

339
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:26,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when we won it in 05, it really did help us out.

340
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:29,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, you know, make sure an independent wins it, guys.

341
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:33,333
[SPEAKER_03]: If it can't be us, we definitely would like to see another independent win it.

342
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:34,533
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

343
00:22:34,934 --> 00:22:35,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast awards.

344
00:22:35,574 --> 00:22:36,935
[SPEAKER_03]: The nominations are open, I think, through the 15th.

345
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

346
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:38,712
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

347
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:47,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hoping that people will suggest independent podcasts from other categories in our thread on the forums to maybe nominate, because I don't know a lot outside of gaming.

348
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:50,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know a couple sci-fi and a couple, but not a lot.

349
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:54,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that we can kind of share and help promote the indie podcasts.

350
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:54,860
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

351
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,240
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

352
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's gaming news.

353
00:22:59,702 --> 00:23:03,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, not a huge surprise, especially with E3 around the corner.

354
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:12,348
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting a lot of announcements of what's going to be coming out at E3, what you can expect to be reading about, because obviously most of you probably aren't going, including us.

355
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:13,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, people.

356
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:21,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so one of those, which isn't a big surprise, and I'm surprised we haven't seen more of it yet, Killzone 2.

357
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:33,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony's invite for, I believe, their press conference and whatnot was, of course, Killzone-themed, and they're probably going to be featuring the game playable or in some sort of trailer.

358
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:34,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing playable.

359
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:39,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's got to be coming out pretty soon at the event, so...

360
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:41,080
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

361
00:23:58,766 --> 00:23:59,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

362
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:02,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it'll all be on the internet within five seconds anyway.

363
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:12,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've seen enough of how the gaming industry works on the inside that what's really going to happen is that the game companies will sell the rights to one of those big box gaming companies.

364
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:21,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And the big box gaming companies will actually post it the day before E3, meaning that all the independent press who actually manages to get into E3 has to run their stories 48 hours late.

365
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,421
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way it's really going to work.

366
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what?

367
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:28,164
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to stay at home and steal other people's articles this year because, hey, it's the American way.

368
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:34,248
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is when these press conferences will be going on, I will not be doing much work at my desk because that's usually the case.

369
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm usually just hitting refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh.

370
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:38,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, news!

371
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:39,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Read it!

372
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:45,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you watch them live, like last year, or is it because it's not as big a, you know, it's low-key, you can't watch that stuff live?

373
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:57,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, but at the work, you know, a lot of the internet's blocked, so a lot of the, you know, unless they're streaming it straight off their site and not off something else, you know, most likely I can't watch it live.

374
00:24:57,227 --> 00:25:00,588
[SPEAKER_02]: But who cares, you know, if I can read about it, that's all I really care about.

375
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:02,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've told you this.

376
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to tell you a little more, give you details offhand.

377
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:13,219
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of our other folks that works for Orange Lounge Radio on one of the other weeknight shows actually had some touch with a game company this week.

378
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And that game company said they'd invite us to E3.

379
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,360
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's, like, too late.

380
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,401
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like E3's only ten days away.

381
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:20,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, great.

382
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:24,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we got a possible invite, and now it's too freaking late.

383
00:25:24,842 --> 00:25:25,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, that sucks.

384
00:25:25,642 --> 00:25:26,002
[SPEAKER_03]: But oh well.

385
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:26,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe next year.

386
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:27,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad it's on a weekend.

387
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:28,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd drive my ass down there.

388
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

389
00:25:46,092 --> 00:25:46,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Big deal.

390
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:51,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... I sadly can't go to PAX because of a wedding, but I hope somebody from the Orange House Radio staff is able to go up there.

391
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:53,277
[SPEAKER_03]: E for All I'm definitely going to, though.

392
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:55,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to make it to E for All.

393
00:25:55,879 --> 00:26:01,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'll end up making it out there, but I would like to go, because it'd be nice to see that stuff.

394
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:03,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Will Rice Princess be going to any of these big gaming conventions?

395
00:26:04,738 --> 00:26:05,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go to BlizzCon.

396
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:06,939
[SPEAKER_01]: BlizzCon?

397
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:07,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

398
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, though, because all the tickets sold out within, what, fucking four days or something like that?

399
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:13,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does that not surprise me?

400
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:13,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

401
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:14,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I think about four hours.

402
00:26:14,944 --> 00:26:15,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Four hours?

403
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:15,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

404
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:16,706
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty quick.

405
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:17,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Days, hours, doesn't matter.

406
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:18,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

407
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:21,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really sad about that, but whatever.

408
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:22,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go next year.

409
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:26,292
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says the SF Bay Area needs a gaming convention, darn it.

410
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

411
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:27,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

412
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:31,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, except there is a whole Game Developers Conference, which is kind of a big deal.

413
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:34,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you remember, though, they did try to do something like that.

414
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:34,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they?

415
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:37,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember there was that one convention that was in San Francisco?

416
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:40,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a weekend, and I don't remember what exactly it was.

417
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:44,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I want to say, it wasn't like sponsored.

418
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:46,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have been sponsored by GameSpot.

419
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:48,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a GameSpot Expo or something like that.

420
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:48,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Tech TV used to be there.

421
00:26:50,438 --> 00:26:52,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't Zip Davis own GameSpot one time?

422
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:53,820
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's one up.

423
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, no, I'm crazy.

424
00:26:55,535 --> 00:26:57,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Ring Game Pro or something.

425
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:01,784
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a GameSpot Expo, I want to say, that was in San Francisco.

426
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:02,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really small.

427
00:27:02,785 --> 00:27:05,589
[SPEAKER_02]: They only had maybe 15 publishers out there.

428
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,316
[SPEAKER_02]: But from what I remember reading, there wasn't that much response to it.

429
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:11,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty crappy.

430
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:15,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides, we're being totally selfish because obviously the SF Bay Area is pretty much in our backyard.

431
00:27:15,698 --> 00:27:17,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about two hours away, so it's totally drivable.

432
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:20,739
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure everybody's like, I wish they'd have a gaming convention in my part of town.

433
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:27,120
[SPEAKER_03]: But the good news is, you know, usually there's at least something small-ish in any type of town.

434
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even if it's like an anime slash game convention, which you see a lot of those everywhere.

435
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:36,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather, you know, go to Gamers Days over, you know, the...

436
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:38,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Giant E3s any day.

437
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:40,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at least you get more one-on-one time with games.

438
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:41,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree.

439
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:44,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the first Konami Gamers Day that we went to.

440
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,748
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty low-key, and we got to play pretty much everything.

441
00:27:48,508 --> 00:28:03,091
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one, though, not so much because of too much press, and the place was kind of smaller, and it seemed like, you know, well, we got to get the shot for our TV show, you know, get out of the way type shit, and everyone's kind of there to do jobs instead of report stuff.

442
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:10,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, obviously one big announcement that came out of... Oh, actually, I want to read a chat comment here.

443
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:12,238
[SPEAKER_03]: GS191 is correcting me here.

444
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, CNET is actually owned by Ziff Davis, so GameSpot by proxy is.

445
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:17,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So, interesting.

446
00:28:17,984 --> 00:28:18,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that.

447
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:20,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

448
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:20,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

449
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:23,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I keep reading chat and I see new stuff pop up.

450
00:28:23,854 --> 00:28:29,415
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a big convention this weekend that might be a little bit near and dear to our hearts, and the folks have been listening to us from the beginning.

451
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:42,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Beaumonti Fest was this weekend on the East Coast, which is, of course, this big Beaumonti and Beatmania and DDR convention that's on the East Coast that they have at a bowling alley, hence the term Beaumonti, which is cute.

452
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:48,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually get, usually, some folks that are actually in the games to come out there and perform, so that's cute.

453
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I was at the East Coast a couple weeks later than I was.

454
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:53,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I could have gone.

455
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, big conventions.

456
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:59,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, one of the big things we saw at E3 was Final Fantasy XIII.

457
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, everybody wants to know, when?

458
00:29:02,303 --> 00:29:03,844
[SPEAKER_03]: When will we get this game?

459
00:29:04,304 --> 00:29:11,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Square Enix has actually said that they will be doing no games for the PlayStation 3 until after April 1st of 2008.

460
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:12,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Why then?

461
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:15,587
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's the new fiscal year.

462
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:19,669
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be no games from Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 this fiscal year.

463
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:23,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big surprise as far as Final Fantasy XIII is regarded.

464
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:24,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most of us here in the U.S.

465
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:29,894
[SPEAKER_03]: were thinking we'd be lucky to see it at the end of 2008 with all the translation and stuff that has to go on.

466
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:30,955
[SPEAKER_03]: But there it is.

467
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:33,014
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's really sad, though.

468
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:43,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when you think about it, because, you know, Sony really needs some strong titles to come out in order to be able to push this PlayStation 3, you know, to the level that the 360 and the Wii are right now.

469
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:50,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were kind of hoping for Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid 4, and both of those now are, you know, after March of next year.

470
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:53,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, missed another Christmas.

471
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:54,424
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good.

472
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:56,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's going to really put them behind.

473
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:58,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're going to be able to catch up.

474
00:29:59,066 --> 00:29:59,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're going to need...

475
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:05,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna have to be one of those, you know, fucking one in a million shots that's gonna...

476
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:08,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's Sony going to push this Christmas?

477
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,274
[SPEAKER_02]: LittleBigPlanet, Home?

478
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:13,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Home, LittleBigPlanet, I get their first party stuff.

479
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:14,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Killzone's not going to be out this year.

480
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:15,356
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way.

481
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:16,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, that's true.

482
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:24,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're probably looking at second quarter of next year, but I would say this year probably Heavenly Sword, I mean, because that's pretty much God of War on the PlayStation 3 anyways.

483
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Lair is going to be good, and probably some unannounced stuff.

484
00:30:30,102 --> 00:30:32,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Ratchet & Clank, the new Ratchet & Clank, it looks awesome.

485
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:36,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, same people did Resistance, and that game was sweet, so...

486
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:37,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

487
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be hard for them.

488
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:45,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says, we'll see Final Fantasy XIII before Duke Nukem Forever.

489
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:46,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.

490
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

491
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:48,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

492
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for the day when Duke Nukem Forever is actually going to come out.

493
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee calls it Final Fantasy Sporever.

494
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:57,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

495
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:58,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Because spore.

496
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:02,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been delayed a year or something.

497
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,319
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all games that people cannot freaking wait for.

498
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:09,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Spore that we've seen playable in some form, and you know what?

499
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:16,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a very large game, and they have to make sure that it's going to be everything that they want it to be before they release it.

500
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,701
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like Fable 2.

501
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:19,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like Fable 2.

502
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:23,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Fable 2 is probably going to be delayed forever because they want to make sure that it's perfect.

503
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:24,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

504
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather them be perfect than, you know,

505
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:30,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Have another Transformers game come out, or Spider-Man 3.

506
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:37,737
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's definitely not been perfect is the brand new firmwares for the PSP.

507
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:45,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one firmware so far released has been able to be not hacked, and such is the case with 3.5.

508
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:54,223
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, last week they found a new kind of workaround called the Illuminati version,

509
00:31:55,831 --> 00:32:01,355
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically uses the old Luminous to run homebrew code.

510
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:06,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, immediately after that came out, there is now a 3.5 downgrader.

511
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:18,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can downgrade your PSPs to be able to run either 1.5, so you can run homebrew that way, or to be able to run custom firmers, which, you know, custom firmers are the way to go, I think.

512
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:24,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Other interesting things, though, because of the Illuminati exploit,

513
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:28,139
[SPEAKER_02]: The Luminous sales have skyrocketed about 14,000%.

514
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:34,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people are picking up Luminous, which, you know, it's a great game anyways, but...

515
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:37,800
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a little hard to find it if you don't have it already.

516
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, most people were ignoring Luminous 1 because Luminous 2 was out now, and I doubt Q Entertainment's making a lot of those.

517
00:32:45,284 --> 00:32:46,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Who published that one, actually?

518
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:47,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Q?

519
00:32:48,205 --> 00:32:49,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it Sony actually published it?

520
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:51,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Q, but I think Ubisoft published it.

521
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:52,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay.

522
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:56,169
[SPEAKER_03]: But Ubisoft has been making a lot of copies of that probably because of Luminous 2.

523
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:57,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's available anymore.

524
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so either, but people are trying to scrounge them up now.

525
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:27,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on Sony platforms, much anticipated, Guitar Hero rocks the 80s And they've done a brilliant job over at Activision of keeping this game in the press every week Before it's released, because they'll give you a few more songs this week A few more songs, a few more songs Well finally we know the whole dang song list Because we've got some more songs this week, and that's it We've got the whole song list Caught in a Mosh by Anthrax is in the game I'm only going to read the songs I care about

526
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Police Truck by the Dead Kennedys We Got the Beat by the Go-Go's and I love this one.

527
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:35,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm turning Japanese by the Vapors.

528
00:33:35,761 --> 00:33:36,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

529
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:37,782
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

530
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:39,302
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a great guitar song.

531
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:41,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you making Rosalind face, Rice Princess?

532
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:42,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the song list sucks.

533
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:43,583
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't like the song list?

534
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:44,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it at all.

535
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:45,984
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some other stuff though that was already announced.

536
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:46,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I read the whole song list.

537
00:33:46,964 --> 00:33:47,724
[SPEAKER_03]: You read the whole thing?

538
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:48,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

539
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:49,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

540
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:49,825
[SPEAKER_03]: They could have done a little better.

541
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:50,805
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you hoping for?

542
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:57,087
[SPEAKER_01]: For like better 80s music that wasn't all just like hair bands and just like

543
00:33:57,776 --> 00:33:58,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Pauly Abdul

544
00:34:29,722 --> 00:34:31,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says Guitar Hero needs Weird Al.

545
00:34:32,563 --> 00:34:35,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says Elite Beat Agents was going to have Weird Al.

546
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:37,746
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was also a song list that turned out to be fake.

547
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:41,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that was ever actually going to be in the band, I think, or in the game.

548
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:43,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I think somebody just kind of pulled that out of their butt.

549
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Money for Nothing would be fucking awesome.

550
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

551
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,531
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.

552
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:49,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami says give us Bohemian Rhapsody.

553
00:34:49,732 --> 00:34:50,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was 70s, though, wasn't it?

554
00:34:51,013 --> 00:34:51,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'd be too long.

555
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:51,993
[SPEAKER_02]: 79 or 78.

556
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,164
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

557
00:34:55,264 --> 00:34:57,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you have it, Guitar Hero 80s Edition.

558
00:34:57,105 --> 00:35:00,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you guys that do like the hair bands, I'm sure you're very excited about that.

559
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:08,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, since E3 is right around the corner, not too surprising, we're starting to get leaked lists from E3.

560
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:11,688
[SPEAKER_02]: This, of course, should be interest to everybody.

561
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:14,729
[SPEAKER_02]: The Konami E3 list was leaked out.

562
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:20,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like coming from a tip to Xbox Live Radio or XBL Radio.

563
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is another affiliate on allgames.com, just like us.

564
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:24,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

565
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:27,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff, of course, not too surprising.

566
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:40,474
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Supernova 2 for PlayStation 2, Universe 2 for the 360, Karaoke Revolution American Idol 2 for the PlayStation 2, a game called DDR Disney Challenge for the PlayStation 2.

567
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:44,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here what else we got.

568
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:47,358
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Disney Challenge?

569
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I thought I read a report somewhere else.

570
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:49,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

571
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I was following that said something Disney Channel.

572
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:55,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably is Disney Channel or something.

573
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:58,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney Challenge sounds kind of weird unless it's like all hard stuff.

574
00:35:59,701 --> 00:35:59,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

575
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:04,766
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this weird game called Girl's Secret Diary for the DS.

576
00:36:05,987 --> 00:36:08,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Record your secrets and dreams in your journal.

577
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait.

578
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:12,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a game that will finally tear you away from WoW?

579
00:36:12,555 --> 00:36:13,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Girl's Secret Diary?

580
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!

581
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:15,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

582
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:22,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, but that game starts to sound like Ping Pals to me and I get very worried because Ping Pals is shittacious.

583
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:25,906
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have Girl's Secret Diary RPG or something.

584
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:31,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're just bitter because it's Girl's Secret Diary and that means you can't use it, Rob.

585
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:34,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh fine, it just sounds like Ping Pals anyway.

586
00:36:35,995 --> 00:36:36,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

587
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:36,735
[SPEAKER_01]: You shut up.

588
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:38,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut your face up.

589
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:40,880
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm totally not going to get that.

590
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:43,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm sure we'll find out more.

591
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:46,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being Avery's, like, what, just over a week away.

592
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:46,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, folks.

593
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:57,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's around the corner that the PlayStation 2 is going to kind of have their year or two of being the budget system, you know, because it's so cheap and most of the games are probably going to fall to $19.99, $29.99.

594
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:08,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So like a Disney game on PlayStation 2 kind of makes a lot of sense to me because, you know, who's going to have the PlayStation 2 now is the young kids that, you know, mommy and daddy are buying systems for.

595
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a perfect title for a $29.99 price point.

596
00:37:13,573 --> 00:37:21,695
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, even though we might be seeing DDR on the PlayStation 2 soon, the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting another long-time series coming to it.

597
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:24,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Wipeout Pulse is going to be coming out.

598
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:30,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe has been showing this off for the past few weeks over there in London.

599
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:42,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Wipeout Pulse is going to be a high-def version of Wipeout, and it's going to be released in 2008, but hopefully we're going to get to see some hints at the game at E3.

600
00:37:44,506 --> 00:37:45,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoopity-doo!

601
00:37:45,727 --> 00:37:47,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, okay, it's high def.

602
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:49,932
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing was pretty much cel-shaded anyways.

603
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:55,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not like that, you know, upping the textures are going to make it any better or anything.

604
00:37:55,638 --> 00:37:56,378
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, cool.

605
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:59,201
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm sure they'll use the six axis and all that fun stuff.

606
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:03,626
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as we get some great raving soundtracks like all the other games, that'll be great.

607
00:38:04,527 --> 00:38:06,889
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Pulse's soundtrack is actually pretty cool.

608
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:11,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Now some other interesting stuff coming from the Sony camp.

609
00:38:11,362 --> 00:38:17,824
[SPEAKER_02]: This one though in India, and unfortunately we're not going to see an advertising campaign like this over here, but oh my god, I wish it was.

610
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:25,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they have a new advertising campaign that is a little bit chauvinistic, I guess.

611
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:29,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just really quickly read the entire ad.

612
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Sherry is such a bitch.

613
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night I saw her with this weird guy whom I think she's seen.

614
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she created such a scene.

615
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:46,543
[SPEAKER_02]: When she broke up with Josie, bloody attention seeker, it's not been a week and she's already sleeping around.

616
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:47,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

617
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:50,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Nicole is two-timing Ron again.

618
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:57,306
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the very bottom it says, PlayStation 2, because your girlfriend bores you shitless.

619
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:58,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha!

620
00:39:00,362 --> 00:39:01,063
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

621
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:02,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they do that here?

622
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,426
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really funny.

623
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:06,190
[SPEAKER_02]: People would be pissed off and get offended and stuff.

624
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you offended as a woman?

625
00:39:08,353 --> 00:39:14,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm offended it's not being advertised here because that's like one of the best advertisements ever because it's so true.

626
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:17,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit While his girlfriend's like So that was kind of funny

627
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:46,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Ross Steel, UT in chat says, and then we wonder why women don't play video games.

628
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:51,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's the only reason why, because gaming companies make offensive advertisements.

629
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:57,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Most women I know would see the offensive advertisement and then go, well, if they're going to be like that, then I'm going to play lots of video games.

630
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:58,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show them.

631
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:00,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to be boring.

632
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:04,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it could be like, you know... Then they'll realize how terrible they are at video games and then they'll stop.

633
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:08,239
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2, if your boyfriend can't satisfy you, Rez will.

634
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:08,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

635
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:11,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, that's so true.

636
00:40:11,644 --> 00:40:13,145
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a great ad campaign as well.

637
00:40:15,307 --> 00:40:18,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see the ad campaigns for Soul Calibur 4.

638
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:21,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, you know, being that Ivy's... Now with more jubblies!

639
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:26,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Ivy's slut-tacious boobs are being shown off in the trailer there.

640
00:40:26,196 --> 00:40:27,817
[SPEAKER_03]: There's massive side boob in those pictures.

641
00:40:27,837 --> 00:40:29,818
[SPEAKER_03]: There is massive side boob in those pictures.

642
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:34,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And a massive bombshell drop this week in regards to Soul Calibur 4.

643
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:37,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the game is coming out next year on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

644
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:41,447
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, Tekken is online now.

645
00:40:41,547 --> 00:40:45,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hello, Namco, is Soul Calibur 4 going to be online?

646
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer is yes.

647
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:50,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And that quote comes from Namco.

648
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:57,237
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, quote, With the current environment, we really couldn't make Soul Calibur 4 without online play.

649
00:40:57,317 --> 00:41:02,500
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from the director, Katsutoshi Sasaki, who makes Soul Calibur 4.

650
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:07,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exciting, because I know a lot of folks like to play their online games.

651
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully there is not some crappy lag.

652
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:10,888
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be bad.

653
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:14,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Because crappy lag always ruins those online fighting games.

654
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:25,774
[SPEAKER_03]: But I actually remember reading some other unrelated story this week that talked about a lag-free system for fighting games that have been developed that's supposed to eliminate practically all the lag that you see in fighting games.

655
00:41:25,794 --> 00:41:30,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how well it works, but maybe Soul Calibur 4 will be able to implement some of this technology.

656
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:31,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

657
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:32,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a myth.

658
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:35,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like those cars that run on air or something like that.

659
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:41,523
[SPEAKER_02]: The magical cars that zero emissions and fuel would be plentiful.

660
00:41:42,784 --> 00:41:43,345
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all a myth.

661
00:41:43,865 --> 00:41:44,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

662
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:49,141
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting, though, this announcement just came out recently.

663
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:55,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the Bourne conspiracy is going to be coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

664
00:41:56,566 --> 00:42:05,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it is based on the Jason Bourne character from the book series, and not necessarily from the movie series, even though the Bourne... Oh, so Matt Damon?

665
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:07,074
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Matt Damon.

666
00:42:07,314 --> 00:42:07,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um...

667
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:08,735
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

668
00:42:30,663 --> 00:42:36,044
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting some feedback on the last story because sometimes there's a little bit of lag here between chat and what we're taping live.

669
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:42,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, chat.orangehauntsradio.com Toshin is in chat and says, this is not a myth, the whole lag-free fighting thing we're talking about.

670
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:43,926
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, my friend made it.

671
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:46,707
[SPEAKER_03]: FYI, ggpo.net.

672
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:47,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

673
00:42:49,848 --> 00:42:50,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll see.

674
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:51,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see how well it's implemented.

675
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:58,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen any videos of it in action yet or gotten to use it myself, but the prospects of it sound very exciting.

676
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:58,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.

677
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:04,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to another title that's having another version coming out.

678
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:09,588
[SPEAKER_03]: TimeSplitters 4 is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

679
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:16,691
[SPEAKER_03]: TimeSplitters kind of seems to... It's not a game you hear about a lot, but a lot of folks that have played this game seem to really enjoy it.

680
00:43:16,711 --> 00:43:18,152
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a TimeSplitters fan, aren't you, Loki?

681
00:43:18,652 --> 00:43:19,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I love TimeSplitters.

682
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:22,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait for this.

683
00:43:23,274 --> 00:43:27,396
[SPEAKER_02]: TimeSplitters is probably hands down one of the best first-person shooter games out there.

684
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially TimeSplitters 2, which is...

685
00:43:29,696 --> 00:43:31,938
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

686
00:43:53,077 --> 00:44:04,024
[SPEAKER_03]: The forum post that originally tipped people off to this also says about the article, there's no actual news on the features other than Steve Ellis says, quote, they're gearing up to insert monkeys and guns into all the wrong places.

687
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:04,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

688
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:08,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that game had lots of monkeys.

689
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:10,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make Loki very happy.

690
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:16,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other interesting stuff, you know, a lot of people have been, of course, overclocking their PSPs with...

691
00:44:17,725 --> 00:44:19,527
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

692
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:50,667
[SPEAKER_02]: The first game that's going to be doing this, though, is God of War Chains of Olympus, and it's going to be running at the full speed on there, because obviously the game's going to be quite graphically intensive.

693
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:59,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting to see that they're actually finally kind of saying, fuck battery life, we're just going to use the full speed of this system.

694
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:07,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is it that folks don't want to use the full speed of the system normally?

695
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:09,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand the way that works.

696
00:45:09,433 --> 00:45:15,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, it's because it cut down on battery life, and so they couldn't advertise that the battery lasts X amount of time.

697
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:17,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, originally, they could run it at the full speed.

698
00:45:17,616 --> 00:45:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you can overclock yours to run at 333 megahertz instead of 222.

699
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:28,960
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, that's what we do for playing Grand Theft Auto, so it's smoother, less load time.

700
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,501
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

701
00:45:32,003 --> 00:45:34,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just their choice, I guess.

702
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:35,545
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to do it.

703
00:45:36,086 --> 00:45:36,386
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

704
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:41,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, our chat room, of course, we're a little bit behind, apparently, because they're still reacting to the last story.

705
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:43,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're talking about the racing cats.

706
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And Actdeft says, we don't want monkeys.

707
00:45:46,432 --> 00:45:47,673
[SPEAKER_03]: We want laser cats.

708
00:45:49,454 --> 00:45:53,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember, we talked about laser cats, the game, and how somebody badly needs to make that.

709
00:45:55,637 --> 00:45:55,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

710
00:45:56,218 --> 00:45:56,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

711
00:45:57,418 --> 00:46:01,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, and then the chat room says that they actually want rap cats.

712
00:46:02,712 --> 00:46:03,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Kill me now.

713
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:35,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they're going to either have a way to dump games to the memory stick, or you're going to have a new download service where you're going to be able to download games to run straight off the memory stick.

714
00:46:36,148 --> 00:46:45,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they kind of do that with demos right now, but it is an official ISO loader, which apparently is going to be included in the next homebrew firmware that's going to be made.

715
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:46,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, the plot thickens.

716
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:47,738
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

717
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:50,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.

718
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though DarkSakura isn't here this week, we're going to sneak behind her back and open up the email bag because we can't wait.

719
00:46:57,144 --> 00:46:58,364
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like kids on Christmas Eve.

720
00:46:58,404 --> 00:46:59,785
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't wait to open up our presents.

721
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:04,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you guys send us emails every week at mailbag at orangeontradio.com, they are like little presents.

722
00:47:05,248 --> 00:47:06,129
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's open up the mailbag.

723
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:18,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, not a whole lot of emails this week, I think because a lot of folks actually got to call into the show last week and kind of say their piece.

724
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:21,305
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we do have some emails.

725
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:22,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to start with this.

726
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:23,666
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from DarkMutz.

727
00:47:24,866 --> 00:47:31,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys and gal, I have been listening to you for about six months and I found your podcast to be the only one that is consistent and always entertaining.

728
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:32,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

729
00:47:33,169 --> 00:47:41,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to thank Loki because without his clever insight about what makes a game fun, I never would have found Earth Defense Force 2017.

730
00:47:41,835 --> 00:47:43,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been addicted since I acquired it.

731
00:47:43,956 --> 00:47:45,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats on five years and keep it coming.

732
00:47:45,778 --> 00:47:50,301
[SPEAKER_03]: The three of you keep me going through my work day without having to light anyone on fire.

733
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:51,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again, DarkMuds.

734
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:53,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

735
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:56,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that a weird feeling when somebody says, like... You know, because video games aren't cheap.

736
00:47:57,314 --> 00:48:03,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, somebody says, like, based on your word, I spent $50 of my hard-earned money for my day job that drives me insane to buy this game.

737
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:07,740
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it's only a $40 game, so that doesn't, you know... But still!

738
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,301
[SPEAKER_02]: But still.

739
00:48:08,341 --> 00:48:08,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

740
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:11,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So what makes a game fun for you, Loki?

741
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:13,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... It's gotta be fun.

742
00:48:13,464 --> 00:48:15,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, we're at the Fence Force.

743
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those games I'm still playing.

744
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:18,307
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because...

745
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,720
[SPEAKER_02]: TimeSplitters 2 TimeSplitters 3

746
00:48:44,953 --> 00:48:46,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

747
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:15,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, D3's awesome.

748
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:23,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing, was it, Work Time Fun right now, and that game is so stupid and awful, but I can't stop playing it.

749
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:23,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

750
00:49:23,816 --> 00:49:26,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Jvmon says, Loki is the king of OLR, and Rob is his puppet.

751
00:49:28,077 --> 00:49:28,497
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

752
00:49:29,238 --> 00:49:36,760
[SPEAKER_03]: RossDLUT, who I've been quoting a lot tonight, I guess I like the cynics tonight, because RossDLUT's kind of our in-house cynic, says, Loki, very fucking insightful.

753
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,261
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes a game fun?

754
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:39,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the game's fun?

755
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:41,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

756
00:49:56,091 --> 00:49:57,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I like blowing stuff up.

757
00:49:57,431 --> 00:50:01,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I like writing boobs in places I shouldn't be able to and naming things.

758
00:50:01,612 --> 00:50:05,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, everybody finds something different to be fun, usually, right?

759
00:50:05,773 --> 00:50:06,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It's whatever.

760
00:50:06,293 --> 00:50:07,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what I find fun.

761
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:08,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It's whatever you find fun.

762
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:13,335
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to trust my judgment with buying a game, you can always go rent it.

763
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:18,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and that's a lot cheaper, and I'm sure a lot of the mom and pop shops out there would really appreciate that from you.

764
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:22,817
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, Tonight's OLR has been brought to you by D3 and by GameTap.

765
00:50:23,097 --> 00:50:23,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I...

766
00:50:24,097 --> 00:50:28,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I neglected to say I played GameTap during my gaming week because I just needed to leave it out for once, alright?

767
00:50:28,702 --> 00:50:31,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I knew there was going to be that fucking comment at some point.

768
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:33,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

769
00:50:34,027 --> 00:50:44,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not on D3 payroll, that's for sure, but at least they have the balls to bring over games that might not necessarily work over here, like Earth Defense Force, and they have that one that's coming out at one point.

770
00:50:45,138 --> 00:50:50,582
[SPEAKER_02]: on the 360 where you're like some chick in lingerie with a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword.

771
00:50:51,002 --> 00:50:54,645
[SPEAKER_02]: That might not necessarily do well over here, but at least they're going to give it a shot.

772
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:55,846
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck are you talking about?

773
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:56,667
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds awesome.

774
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,008
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name of the game.

775
00:50:58,028 --> 00:50:58,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what it's called.

776
00:50:58,928 --> 00:51:02,551
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some long Japanese name and I'm not even going to attempt to remember what it was.

777
00:51:04,012 --> 00:51:09,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see, um, Actdeft says, uh, Pac-Man Championship Edition is fun, yet Loki doesn't see that.

778
00:51:09,437 --> 00:51:12,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because everybody, I think Pac-Man Championship Edition is a hell of a lot of fun.

779
00:51:12,941 --> 00:51:20,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It's way more fast-paced than the old one, which I think is awesome, and, you know, the Ray-Ban music and everything, but Loki, I'm just not a fan of Pac-Man that much.

780
00:51:20,227 --> 00:51:26,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, I love the retro, like, really, really retro classics and updates and that stuff, you know, like the old school arcade games.

781
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:29,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like I'm playing Zelda 2 now for some reason, and I don't know why.

782
00:51:30,203 --> 00:51:30,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Zelda 2?

783
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a good game.

784
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:33,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

785
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:33,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes it is.

786
00:51:34,688 --> 00:51:35,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a great game.

787
00:51:35,629 --> 00:51:36,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.

788
00:51:36,149 --> 00:51:37,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I need to buy that on the Wii.

789
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:38,992
[SPEAKER_03]: You totally do.

790
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:39,973
[SPEAKER_03]: What else was I going to say?

791
00:51:40,093 --> 00:51:43,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other fun factor games that people are overlooking right now?

792
00:51:45,154 --> 00:51:46,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I think about Katamari Damacy.

793
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:48,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what sold that game?

794
00:51:48,677 --> 00:51:50,959
[SPEAKER_03]: The fun factor and the fact that it was a low price.

795
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:54,782
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game itself was, you know, it wasn't exactly graphically the most impressive.

796
00:51:54,802 --> 00:51:58,485
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like, you know, you would ask people, what draws you to Katamari Damacy?

797
00:51:58,505 --> 00:52:00,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And people just go, it's fucking fun to roll over shit.

798
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:02,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, you have your cynics.

799
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:05,351
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one everybody should say, that game sucks.

800
00:52:05,691 --> 00:52:07,113
[SPEAKER_03]: You know they're welcome to that opinion.

801
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend it.

802
00:52:08,394 --> 00:52:12,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and this would be pretty hard to find nowadays, but if you can, find it.

803
00:52:12,757 --> 00:52:15,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't recommend buying it, but if you can rent it.

804
00:52:16,204 --> 00:52:16,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Driver 3.

805
00:52:17,405 --> 00:52:20,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, it's such a horrible game.

806
00:52:20,266 --> 00:52:25,810
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really a game that you need to play because you're just like, oh my god, I can't believe it's really this bad.

807
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's entertaining in that aspect.

808
00:52:27,991 --> 00:52:33,274
[SPEAKER_02]: My sister is borrowing my PlayStation 2 and we have that game dumped on the hard drive so she can play it.

809
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And I swear to god, she plays this thing more than anything else.

810
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:37,537
[SPEAKER_02]: on that damn system.

811
00:52:37,617 --> 00:52:43,022
[SPEAKER_02]: They will sit there for hours recording instant replays and watching the AI get all fucked up.

812
00:52:43,183 --> 00:52:46,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Driver 3 is the showgirls of gaming.

813
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:47,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so bad, it's pretty good.

814
00:52:48,848 --> 00:52:55,395
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, there's a lot of games out there that are really hard to, a lot of people overlook that are fun.

815
00:52:55,415 --> 00:52:57,817
[SPEAKER_02]: You just really have to play a lot of the stuff.

816
00:52:58,198 --> 00:52:59,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Saints Row is another one that I love.

817
00:53:00,006 --> 00:53:00,547
[SPEAKER_01]: New email.

818
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:02,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, Saints Row, the musical.

819
00:53:03,232 --> 00:53:04,094
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so funny.

820
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:05,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Only three emails tonight.

821
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:06,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the second one.

822
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:09,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is from The Doctor.

823
00:53:10,342 --> 00:53:11,163
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

824
00:53:39,402 --> 00:53:44,748
[SPEAKER_03]: urge her to leave her friend code in our forums because we actually have a forum post for Pokemon friend codes.

825
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on back to the doctor's email.

826
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:48,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Second is for Sky.

827
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:49,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I heart you.

828
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:50,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

829
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:55,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And could you say, excuse me, DarkSakura, again, please, please, please.

830
00:53:55,658 --> 00:53:56,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see what I can do.

831
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:58,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Third is for Loki.

832
00:54:27,503 --> 00:54:28,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

833
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:45,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, they can be as hard as you want to make them, I guess.

834
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,102
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, oh my god, and I don't remember the guy.

835
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:54,268
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this one Japanese guy that had a website with edits on there, and they were the fucking shit.

836
00:54:54,408 --> 00:54:59,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember who the guy is now because I haven't been playing edits for a long time, but I don't know.

837
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:05,938
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look for some DDR edit websites, this guy is just amazing.

838
00:55:06,118 --> 00:55:07,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a bunch of ASCII artists on his site, so.

839
00:55:08,697 --> 00:55:11,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I wish I could be more helpful there, but some great stuff.

840
00:55:11,878 --> 00:55:17,040
[SPEAKER_02]: They had one for, it was called Swingman, that was on... I remember that.

841
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the jazz, and it was an awesome edit.

842
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:23,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It had just this real flow to it that was really cool.

843
00:55:24,564 --> 00:55:25,944
[SPEAKER_03]: One last question from the doctor.

844
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:30,466
[SPEAKER_03]: When did Squaresoft become Square Enix, and why?

845
00:55:30,866 --> 00:55:32,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as we call them here on the show, Squeenix.

846
00:55:33,823 --> 00:55:35,604
[SPEAKER_03]: When did Square Enix become... Why?

847
00:55:35,924 --> 00:55:37,185
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, what, about three years ago?

848
00:55:37,265 --> 00:55:38,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Two or three years ago.

849
00:55:38,146 --> 00:55:41,028
[SPEAKER_03]: They bought Enix, which made a bunch of games.

850
00:55:41,168 --> 00:55:45,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Quest is probably their most popular series of games, which you may know as Dragon Warrior.

851
00:55:46,592 --> 00:55:47,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Years ago, it was called.

852
00:55:48,533 --> 00:55:50,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And what else did they make?

853
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:56,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I know on Super Nintendo, they were very popular for Brain Lord and Illusion of Gaia and those games.

854
00:55:56,858 --> 00:56:01,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on, I also know for music game fans, they were the folks that made Bust a Move.

855
00:56:01,982 --> 00:56:03,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they do the Tobol series?

856
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:05,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, excuse me, Dark Sakura!

857
00:56:30,802 --> 00:56:31,122
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

858
00:57:00,808 --> 00:57:02,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so gonna get beat up.

859
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:04,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you, Jamie, wherever you are.

860
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:06,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, one more email.

861
00:57:07,848 --> 00:57:13,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one wasn't signed, so I don't really know who to say who this is from.

862
00:57:13,492 --> 00:57:14,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if I want to read the name.

863
00:57:15,273 --> 00:57:17,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Ikuma is in the header, so we'll just say it's from them.

864
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,335
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, Hi there.

865
00:57:19,795 --> 00:57:24,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been listening for one and a half year, and just want to take this opportunity to wish you guys happy 5th.

866
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:30,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a developer in Japan, and yes, Rob had once mentioned our game in the new release section.

867
00:57:30,382 --> 00:57:32,683
[SPEAKER_03]: We all just love it when Rob reads in Japanese.

868
00:57:33,023 --> 00:57:34,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a cute little face there.

869
00:57:34,964 --> 00:57:36,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And who says no love from developer?

870
00:57:36,866 --> 00:57:37,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha.

871
00:57:37,847 --> 00:57:40,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you guy would be part of my Friday for another five years to come.

872
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:41,650
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

873
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:50,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So, unfortunately, this person didn't say who they are, what developer they're talking about, or any of that stuff, just that I have horribly butchered the name of one of their games on the program in the past.

874
00:57:51,096 --> 00:57:51,937
[SPEAKER_03]: That's love, though.

875
00:57:51,957 --> 00:57:52,577
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

876
00:57:52,617 --> 00:57:53,138
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

877
00:57:53,158 --> 00:57:53,778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

878
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:55,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for the email.

879
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:03,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Gee, tell us who you are, because we'd love to have more developers on the show, especially ones that are, you know, crazy enough to listen to this.

880
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:05,587
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd also love to be invited to Tokyo Game Show.

881
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:05,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

882
00:58:06,127 --> 00:58:08,749
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTitsuya asks, was it the developer of Dust Cap Extreme 2 Collector's Edition?

883
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:23,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably one of your, like, hamster love games or something.

884
00:58:23,322 --> 00:58:24,243
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I hope so.

885
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:25,263
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I hope so.

886
00:58:25,423 --> 00:58:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

887
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:26,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

888
00:58:26,563 --> 00:58:29,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Please tell me you guys develop one of those, like, hamster games.

889
00:58:30,224 --> 00:58:32,964
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one of those hamster games coming out over here.

890
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple hamster games coming out over here.

891
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:37,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Hamster Life 2 is coming out over here now.

892
00:58:37,965 --> 00:58:39,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Those Ubisoft games.

893
00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:40,826
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

894
00:58:40,886 --> 00:58:41,646
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the last email.

895
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:42,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to close up the old mailbag.

896
00:58:43,006 --> 00:58:45,347
[SPEAKER_03]: How it comes to the Wii, because I would totally buy that game.

897
00:58:45,547 --> 00:58:47,767
[SPEAKER_03]: God, that made me so happy when I read that email.

898
00:58:47,787 --> 00:58:48,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, good.

899
00:58:48,628 --> 00:58:50,508
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not getting all pissed off that I'm butchering their...

900
00:58:51,345 --> 00:58:52,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Their releases.

901
00:58:52,686 --> 00:58:53,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny American.

902
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:56,129
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

903
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:57,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the gaming news.

904
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:00,313
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelauncher.com.

905
00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:05,016
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're from an American, Canadian, Antarctican developer, who cares?

906
00:59:05,177 --> 00:59:09,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Email us and tell us you're listening because we love to hear that folks in the industry are listening.

907
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, totally need to meet up at the arcade in Antarctica to play some DDR.

908
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:14,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up and get to the next story.

909
00:59:15,225 --> 00:59:19,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Civilizations coming to consoles and...

910
00:59:20,382 --> 00:59:28,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Handheld soon, being brought over by 2K Games and developed by FireAxis Games, Civilization Revolution.

911
00:59:28,887 --> 00:59:33,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to include 16 civilizations to master and lead to victory.

912
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:38,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, famous historical leaders, yada, yada, yada.

913
00:59:38,632 --> 00:59:40,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Online multiplayer as well is going to be in it.

914
00:59:41,393 --> 00:59:42,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

915
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:43,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

916
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:48,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a huge Civilization fan, but it sounds interesting.

917
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:09,317
[SPEAKER_03]: and Stab Myself with the blunt end gauge.

918
01:00:10,638 --> 01:00:12,899
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are what, spin-off games?

919
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are these direct ports?

920
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a spin-off series.

921
01:00:15,941 --> 01:00:20,284
[SPEAKER_03]: When I read it, it sounded like a spin-off series, which can go who knows any which way.

922
01:00:20,364 --> 01:00:25,727
[SPEAKER_03]: That could, you know, God, then that makes me worry, is this going to turn out like the Mortal Kombat anthology stories?

923
01:00:25,807 --> 01:00:27,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember like the Sub-Zero game?

924
01:00:28,609 --> 01:00:31,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's anything like that, but I hope not.

925
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,512
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's probably going to be maybe a little bit more scaled down for consoles.

926
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:35,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

927
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:37,172
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds okay.

928
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:39,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, do you really need to scale down for consoles?

929
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:44,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I just could not see the full game itself on an Xbox 360.

930
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:49,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And the biggest reason why is that there's no mouse, and those thumbsticks don't cut it.

931
01:00:49,722 --> 01:00:53,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, some games were meant to be played with a mouse, and that's all there is to it.

932
01:00:53,746 --> 01:00:59,631
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't understand why they just don't have keyboard and mouse support, since it has fucking USB ports.

933
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:04,595
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, all of the quote-unquote next-gen, you know,

934
01:01:05,825 --> 01:01:10,006
[SPEAKER_02]: platforms have USB ports that can put a keyboard and mouse on there.

935
01:01:11,306 --> 01:01:14,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for maybe the Wii, that'd be kind of stupid because you have the Wii remote, but, you know.

936
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:19,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, though, if you really want to, and if they really would decide to support it, they could put a keyboard and mouse on there.

937
01:01:20,528 --> 01:01:32,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, another very popular PC gaming series is Guild Wars, and IGN had an interview this week on their PC side about Guild Wars 2 and the Eye of the North expansion for Guild Wars.

938
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:34,012
[SPEAKER_03]: You played Guild Wars for a little bit, right?

939
01:01:34,252 --> 01:01:34,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally did.

940
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:35,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And what'd you think?

941
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

942
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:48,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe there's something in the Eye of the North for you, because Eye of the North, I was kind of reading through the interview here, and if you want to read the full thing, head over to pc.ign.com and you can read the full thing.

943
01:01:49,431 --> 01:01:58,496
[SPEAKER_03]: What I didn't know, because I didn't know a lot about these games before I was reading the interview, and Eye of the North is actually the first Guild Wars expansion that requires one of the other expansions to play.

944
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:06,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for that is that all of the content they've put into this, they put 18 new dungeons, and they're all for, like, endgame characters.

945
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:06,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

946
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:13,106
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whereas with any of the other expansions, you can buy them by themselves and create a character from the ground up.

947
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:18,831
[SPEAKER_03]: But for this one, they didn't waste any time making a level 1 through 20 story.

948
01:02:18,891 --> 01:02:22,734
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all like hardcore endgame content, which I think is kind of interesting about that.

949
01:02:23,175 --> 01:02:23,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.

950
01:02:24,423 --> 01:02:27,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it kind of went to talking about how they're actually developing the game.

951
01:02:27,965 --> 01:02:31,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they actually split into two different development teams?

952
01:02:31,927 --> 01:02:38,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, there's a development team for Guild Wars 2 right now, but then the Eyes of the North people will come over when Guild Wars 2 is done.

953
01:02:39,212 --> 01:02:47,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And they admit that most of the resources are being focused on the Guild Wars expansion, but then they're going to all shift over to Guild Wars 2 once the expansion is done.

954
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:50,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So this definitely sounds like it's going to be the last Guild Wars expansion.

955
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:57,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually say that they do kind of tend to monitor the trends in the PvP, like, metagames that people come up with.

956
01:02:58,243 --> 01:03:04,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they kind of, like, figure out, use those ideas for, like, live events and holiday events.

957
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:06,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And they claim them for themselves.

958
01:03:06,109 --> 01:03:08,430
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, that was my idea!

959
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute!

960
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:15,195
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they just sound like they're really tied down to the community, which I think is great.

961
01:03:15,935 --> 01:03:16,316
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

962
01:03:16,516 --> 01:03:18,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Some exciting news for Guild Wars fans.

963
01:03:19,022 --> 01:03:19,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

964
01:03:19,743 --> 01:03:28,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so we've got some interesting stuff, I guess, making its way out to the U.S.

965
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:30,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot, though.

966
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:34,015
[SPEAKER_02]: This week's kind of dead, as most of July usually is.

967
01:03:35,957 --> 01:03:44,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much this week, though, the only things you've got are Ninja Gaiden Sigma for PlayStation 3 and Vampire Reign on the Xbox 360.

968
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,232
[SPEAKER_02]: That is about it.

969
01:03:48,872 --> 01:03:56,717
[SPEAKER_02]: PC games, there's a bunch of weird stuff coming out, including, let's see, well, actually, Marvel treating card games coming out on PC.

970
01:03:57,218 --> 01:03:59,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Title Legends 2 is coming out on PC.

971
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Ride, Carnival Tycoon.

972
01:04:04,322 --> 01:04:07,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, every fucking week there's a goddamn tycoon game coming out.

973
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:14,808
[SPEAKER_02]: DS, Platinum Sudoku, and Vegas Casino High Five.

974
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:16,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Making its way out.

975
01:04:18,035 --> 01:04:20,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is it.

976
01:04:20,538 --> 01:04:25,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's head on over to the Japanese release dates and check out what's going on in Japan.

977
01:04:26,304 --> 01:04:28,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Chicken Shoot coming out this week?

978
01:04:28,306 --> 01:04:29,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicken Shoot came out last week, though.

979
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:30,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, did it really?

980
01:04:31,069 --> 01:04:31,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

981
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, Chicken Shoot's great.

982
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:36,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, because it was on the list over here, but as a US release, so...

983
01:04:36,895 --> 01:04:37,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Boku no Natsusiasa Boku no Natsuyasumi

984
01:05:00,327 --> 01:05:03,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Boku no Natsu Yasumi 3 is coming out.

985
01:05:03,908 --> 01:05:05,388
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the more I practice, the better I get.

986
01:05:05,408 --> 01:05:06,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bug-catching game.

987
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:08,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we get anything like that over here?

988
01:05:08,509 --> 01:05:09,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't that look cute?

989
01:05:10,149 --> 01:05:12,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's what Africa is going to actually be all about.

990
01:05:12,449 --> 01:05:12,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Africa.

991
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Poaching animals?

992
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you poach animals.

993
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,550
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

994
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:25,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that because I see the little guy on the cover of the game is holding a little bug net and a little thing that you keep bugs in.

995
01:05:25,872 --> 01:05:26,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

996
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:30,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if there's anything else coming out on some of the other platforms that you might be looking forward to.

997
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:30,959
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

998
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:35,403
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really crazy kid with bug net murders family.

999
01:05:36,504 --> 01:05:37,364
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2.

1000
01:05:38,465 --> 01:05:46,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stuff really just moving into the best hits like Winning Post 7, Ape Escape 3, and Ratchet & Clank 4th is all moving into the best.

1001
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of new stuff coming out otherwise, but some price reductions there.

1002
01:05:51,069 --> 01:05:52,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Cururin Donuts, Okashi Recipe

1003
01:06:09,318 --> 01:06:13,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea what that is, but it's got a happy donut on the cover and it's an action game.

1004
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of makes it look like it might be a racing game involving donuts.

1005
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:17,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no fucking idea.

1006
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:19,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy donut action game.

1007
01:06:19,482 --> 01:06:21,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but who wouldn't want to buy a happy donut action game?

1008
01:06:21,743 --> 01:06:22,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1009
01:06:22,263 --> 01:06:23,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd buy a happy donut action game.

1010
01:06:24,004 --> 01:06:25,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Poochie Poochie Virus.

1011
01:06:28,065 --> 01:06:30,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fascinating and is also coming out on the DS.

1012
01:06:31,466 --> 01:06:32,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also another action game.

1013
01:06:33,939 --> 01:06:38,063
[SPEAKER_03]: with a cast of very chibi-looking characters there, also coming to Japan.

1014
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:43,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Quickly looking to see if there's anything on the PSP this week in Japan.

1015
01:06:45,549 --> 01:06:51,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Just some games going into the best hits, including Rengoku 2, The Stairway to Heaven.

1016
01:06:51,894 --> 01:06:53,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Hell, depending on how you look at it.

1017
01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:57,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, going over to the European release dates.

1018
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,523
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, sadly not here this week, but on July 6th,

1019
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:13,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you over in Europe can look forward to The King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2 and The King of Fighters 11 on the PlayStation 2 as well as the Metal Slug Anthology coming out on the PlayStation 2.

1020
01:07:14,004 --> 01:07:14,645
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really it.

1021
01:07:15,045 --> 01:07:17,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very slow week for those of you guys in Europe.

1022
01:07:19,188 --> 01:07:20,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that does it for release dates.

1023
01:07:21,169 --> 01:07:21,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um...

1024
01:07:22,614 --> 01:07:42,383
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it may be a little too soon, but the VTech report covering what happened with the shootings at Virginia Tech, apparently there's no mention of the video game issue, despite the fact that everybody was saying, hey, video games made him kill people, da-da-da-da-da.

1025
01:07:42,423 --> 01:07:44,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting.

1026
01:07:45,284 --> 01:07:50,907
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently the PAC, though, they've denounced the report saying that it's a cover-up

1027
01:07:51,445 --> 01:07:56,348
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're claiming, you know, that really it was video games to blame and it's this giant cover-up.

1028
01:07:56,488 --> 01:07:57,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shut up.

1029
01:07:57,809 --> 01:07:58,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1030
01:07:59,611 --> 01:08:01,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut the hell up, people.

1031
01:08:01,692 --> 01:08:04,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do people want to blame video games for everything?

1032
01:08:06,435 --> 01:08:06,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1033
01:08:07,136 --> 01:08:13,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, people want to focus on whatever their agenda is and if they really have, you know,

1034
01:08:14,503 --> 01:08:14,983
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1035
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:41,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat room, chat.orangehauntradio.com, live on Sunday nights.

1036
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:45,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Solid Goomba says, didn't they search his room and not even find a single console?

1037
01:08:46,061 --> 01:08:47,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember that to be the case.

1038
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:59,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, just because he participates in a goddamn extracurricular activity, which includes playing a computer game, oh my god, oh my god, you know, that doesn't mean that he's trained on that computer game to be a killer.

1039
01:08:59,424 --> 01:09:05,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, but there is no way on the face of the earth to train on a PC game to become a killer.

1040
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:11,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for some sad whatever reason, people have the need to blame something.

1041
01:09:12,216 --> 01:09:22,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and obviously what happened at Virginia Tech was just absolutely tremendously horrible, and a lot of us had that reaction of, how could something like this happen?

1042
01:09:22,886 --> 01:09:27,109
[SPEAKER_03]: How fucked up is this world that some kid would do this to their peers?

1043
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:32,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think out of that desperation, people look for something to blame, and video games, unfortunately, are an easy target.

1044
01:09:32,887 --> 01:09:40,312
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, they allow you to pretend that you are someone else and unfortunately not everybody can see that line.

1045
01:09:40,392 --> 01:09:47,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know why this was an issue when they didn't even have any sort of evidence in the beginning that, you know, video games were even involved in any way.

1046
01:09:47,397 --> 01:09:49,539
[SPEAKER_02]: But immediately they're saying, oh, it must be this.

1047
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:55,022
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Doom, it's Marilyn Manson, it's MTV, it's all this that did this.

1048
01:09:56,103 --> 01:09:56,303
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1049
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:58,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take responsibility, people.

1050
01:09:58,064 --> 01:09:58,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, uh...

1051
01:09:59,273 --> 01:10:07,019
[SPEAKER_03]: A crazy, crazy, crazy person that probably, I don't know, I don't even want to speculate because I'll say something that will be foot and mouth syndrome.

1052
01:10:07,419 --> 01:10:11,942
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it was a very unfortunate thing, period.

1053
01:10:12,122 --> 01:10:13,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I blame World War II.

1054
01:10:14,484 --> 01:10:15,344
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I blame.

1055
01:10:16,565 --> 01:10:20,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all those, you know, World War II documentaries out there that show the kamikazes.

1056
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:21,569
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I blame.

1057
01:10:21,929 --> 01:10:24,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I blame the Atari 2600, don't you?

1058
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:26,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

1059
01:10:26,492 --> 01:10:28,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have the man bomber after all in there.

1060
01:10:29,484 --> 01:10:30,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1061
01:10:47,048 --> 01:10:47,709
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1062
01:11:05,825 --> 01:11:11,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if it's going to actually support ROMs or if you're going to buy games a la iTunes or what the deal is.

1063
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:14,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's really easy to get free Atari games online at this point.

1064
01:11:14,928 --> 01:11:20,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, the entire collection of Atari games, everything ever made, is six megs.

1065
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:23,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could easily fit that on a USB card.

1066
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:24,051
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very tiny.

1067
01:11:24,351 --> 01:11:27,892
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I would like to see that used for is maybe some homebrew.

1068
01:11:27,912 --> 01:11:31,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, even the Atari 2600 still has some homebrew love.

1069
01:11:31,493 --> 01:11:32,573
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of homebrew love for it.

1070
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:33,614
[SPEAKER_03]: So you never know what might happen.

1071
01:11:34,214 --> 01:11:34,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1072
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I would necessarily buy this though, but I don't know.

1073
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:38,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.

1074
01:11:38,889 --> 01:11:41,751
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was like 20 bucks or something, it might be worth it.

1075
01:11:42,011 --> 01:11:53,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Games were so simple back then, and sometimes that's kind of like, you know, like I was saying last week, I found myself playing Pitfall for God knows what reason for quite a chunk of time on last Saturday.

1076
01:11:53,436 --> 01:11:58,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine, if you will, if they were to bring combat to Xbox Live Arcade?

1077
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:02,120
[SPEAKER_02]: and have like leaderboards for that shit, that'd be fucking awesome.

1078
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't they going to bring some old Atari classics?

1079
01:12:04,501 --> 01:12:07,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I seem to remember Warlords was coming to Xbox Live.

1080
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:08,663
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an old school Atari game.

1081
01:12:08,883 --> 01:12:10,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course we have Centipede and Millipede.

1082
01:12:10,624 --> 01:12:13,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I want combat with no graphical upgrades whatsoever.

1083
01:12:13,405 --> 01:12:15,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want the whole thing to be done like that.

1084
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:20,168
[SPEAKER_02]: What if they did the classic graphics slash upgrade graphics?

1085
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:21,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if they really want to do that.

1086
01:12:21,849 --> 01:12:24,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd be fine with just the classic graphics because I think that'd be funny.

1087
01:12:25,611 --> 01:12:28,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And just have like a leaderboard thing where you know...

1088
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:32,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did not realize you were such an Atari 2600 fan.

1089
01:12:32,116 --> 01:12:35,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I used to play the Atari 2600 all the time.

1090
01:12:35,437 --> 01:12:36,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge Combat fan.

1091
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:37,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, keep that in mind for later on.

1092
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:39,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to see what happens later on.

1093
01:12:39,758 --> 01:12:43,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tease something coming up in Part B. That's all I have to say.

1094
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:44,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1095
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:45,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so...

1096
01:12:47,361 --> 01:12:52,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the ESRB is cracking down on violent game trailers now.

1097
01:12:53,604 --> 01:13:10,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing really new, but of course, especially after the whole fiasco with Manhunt 2, they're kind of, I guess, taking notice on some of the trailers that have been released out there, including Gears of War, which was available online since January, is now, of course, coming down.

1098
01:13:11,533 --> 01:13:16,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, Darkness and Dark Sector videos have been

1099
01:13:18,078 --> 01:13:26,345
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately, I guess, pulled because, I guess, they were too bloody or whatever and, I guess, were an adult-only thing.

1100
01:13:26,665 --> 01:13:32,670
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they should have such a thing as a Red Band trailer for games, I think, but I don't know.

1101
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:43,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of stupid, though, since, you know, before they were rating them with, you know, oh, because they're interactive and stuff, we've got to rate them a little harsher, which is dumb anyways, but you're watching a video of gameplay.

1102
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:45,100
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have any sort of interaction with it.

1103
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know,

1104
01:13:47,682 --> 01:13:48,262
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1105
01:14:09,432 --> 01:14:12,153
[SPEAKER_03]: where the preview is for restricted audiences only.

1106
01:14:12,613 --> 01:14:18,555
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because they'll have a gunshot in it or a real quick bloodshot or maybe some boobie.

1107
01:14:18,575 --> 01:14:23,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be an ad for a sexy movie and you see a lady wearing a dress that's see-through or something.

1108
01:14:23,736 --> 01:14:26,157
[SPEAKER_02]: You see Red Band trailers once in a while.

1109
01:14:26,357 --> 01:14:33,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of ridiculous that they're policing game trailers because that's not even... It's not the actual game.

1110
01:14:33,899 --> 01:14:35,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a video.

1111
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,060
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be like,

1112
01:14:37,003 --> 01:14:46,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that they do that with movie trailers, you know, that they rate that this trailer isn't good for all audiences and stuff, but I think it's kind of ridiculous to do that with games.

1113
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:52,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have sworn I heard some point that yellow bands were coming for the PG-13 and up audiences only.

1114
01:14:52,494 --> 01:15:02,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't, I can't remember, maybe it was R, no, yeah, it was PG-13 audiences only were going to have yellow band trailers, but I don't know if that ever, I might just be pulling that out of my butt, but I seem to remember reading that somewhere.

1115
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:03,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1116
01:15:04,565 --> 01:15:09,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, obviously this next topic is rated G. This is definitely for everybody.

1117
01:15:10,286 --> 01:15:10,926
[SPEAKER_03]: This cat!

1118
01:15:11,447 --> 01:15:11,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, hold on!

1119
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:17,348
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is not here this week, so we can't do a website of the week.

1120
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:22,029
[SPEAKER_03]: But if she could, and she was here this week, I'm pretty sure this would have been a top contender for her website of the week.

1121
01:15:22,069 --> 01:15:24,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yes, Loki, you can do your outburst now.

1122
01:15:24,089 --> 01:15:26,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, this cat right here made me get a cat.

1123
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:27,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1124
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:28,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?

1125
01:15:28,517 --> 01:15:30,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's super cute, and I want a gaming cat.

1126
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:44,587
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, yes, this is the Famico blog, and you can visit this blog if you'd like to at lovefami.blog90.fc2.com, and this is just a cat that poses with it.

1127
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:47,169
[SPEAKER_03]: They make poses of it playing the DS and the 360.

1128
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:48,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever see the other?

1129
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:49,530
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so cute.

1130
01:15:49,951 --> 01:15:50,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see?

1131
01:15:50,471 --> 01:15:51,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at that one up.

1132
01:15:51,712 --> 01:15:52,032
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.

1133
01:15:52,292 --> 01:15:52,612
[SPEAKER_02]: One more up.

1134
01:15:52,973 --> 01:15:53,473
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that one.

1135
01:15:53,493 --> 01:15:53,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going down.

1136
01:15:54,554 --> 01:15:55,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, keep going.

1137
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:56,699
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

1138
01:16:24,028 --> 01:16:25,269
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so cute.

1139
01:16:25,369 --> 01:16:26,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, go, go.

1140
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:27,570
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a picture right there.

1141
01:16:29,732 --> 01:16:30,672
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a very cute cat.

1142
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:33,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe the cat's name is Famicom, right?

1143
01:16:34,235 --> 01:16:36,556
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Fami, or Fami, named after the Famicom.

1144
01:16:37,537 --> 01:16:38,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cute.

1145
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Named after famine.

1146
01:16:39,498 --> 01:16:43,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you wanting to... You're so messed up.

1147
01:16:44,362 --> 01:16:46,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you wanting to get a kitty someday, Rice Princess?

1148
01:16:46,503 --> 01:16:46,663
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1149
01:16:47,584 --> 01:16:47,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1150
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted you to contribute something to this show.

1151
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:56,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to attempt to get the cat that we're getting to sit there in a pose that'll look like it's playing DS.

1152
01:16:57,277 --> 01:16:59,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's going to work, but we're going to try it.

1153
01:16:59,559 --> 01:17:03,522
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you need to do is get the cat to pose reading porn.

1154
01:17:04,022 --> 01:17:04,883
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be funny.

1155
01:17:05,424 --> 01:17:06,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a picture of that.

1156
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:07,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any porn.

1157
01:17:07,425 --> 01:17:09,066
[SPEAKER_02]: At least not in magazine form.

1158
01:17:09,086 --> 01:17:10,347
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you not have porn?

1159
01:17:10,568 --> 01:17:12,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get my laptop and put porn on it.

1160
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:15,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I will buy you a freaking Playboy or something and you can pose the cat with porn.

1161
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:18,373
[SPEAKER_02]: and have it drinking alcohol.

1162
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you should be Stella the Porno Cat.

1163
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:25,981
[SPEAKER_03]: You should get a little pimp hat.

1164
01:17:26,582 --> 01:17:26,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

1165
01:17:27,495 --> 01:17:32,437
