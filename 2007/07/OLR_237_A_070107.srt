1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,280
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Wonky.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,840
Tonight July 1st, 2007, Soulcalibur IV goes online, The World of Civilization comes to

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:32,520
consoles and our achievements about to get product placement.

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,600
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Radio.

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,520
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,160
You might know me as Sky.

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,400
Not joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,840
She has the night off, as many of you longtime listeners of the show may know.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,960
She's been very active in taking up massage therapy.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,520
She has a little bit of a conflict with her schooling tonight, but the show must go on,

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
and joining me as always, say hello to Lokey.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Hello.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,800
How are you doing, Lokey?

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm doing okay.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,880
I just scoffed down a sandwich.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
Yeah, you had like a large Quiznos.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
It wasn't like a...

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Regular size.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Was it?

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Yeah, it was a regular size.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,120
It was a balancing act with a sandwich, and also it is spicy, so it's like, you know...

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,880
Spicy sandwich.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,160
Regular size, black Angus steak sandwich.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
All right.

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
Yum, yum.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Yum, yum.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,760
But not that we endorse any particular commercial products here on this program.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
No.

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
No.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
All right.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,360
Filling in tonight of sorts, we have Rice Princess joining us tonight.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
Hello.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
How are you doing?

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Is your mic on, sweetie?

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
I don't know.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
We didn't hear you there.

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
It totally is on now.

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,360
You're just a little quieter than DarkSakura is, so we'll just adjust your volume.

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
Very professional radio, but that's what happens when you're live.

42
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Try again.

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Great idea.

44
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
Okay.

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Good job.

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
That's all right.

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Say hello to our listeners, and I'll adjust you on the fly here.

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Okay.

49
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Hi, listeners.

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
How's it going?

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Good.

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Thanks.

53
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
I don't know.

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,160
If you want to tell Rice Princess how you're doing, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

55
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,280
We do tape live here on Sunday nights at orangelaungeradio.com, and Rice Princess will just be helping us get a third

56
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,040
perspective tonight, but also the chat room is there, as always, to give us a million

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
more perspectives.

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
Yes.

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
You're right.

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
You're in the chat room.

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Maybe.

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
That would be the best thing ever.

63
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,440
Well, not in the chat room.

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,240
Four or five different opinions in the chat room.

65
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Yeah.

66
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
And one of them's a robot.

67
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Over and over.

68
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
All right.

69
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,880
Anyhow, let's start off tonight's show with a little bit of how is your gaming week, where

70
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,040
we talk about what we've been playing this week.

71
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Loki, I guess you're going to start us off tonight.

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Okay.

73
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Well, this week I've been playing some interesting things.

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Some have actually, you know, people have been questioning why I'm playing them, like

75
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,120
the Transformers game, for one.

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,760
I was playing that on 360.

77
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,200
It's okay.

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,760
It's kind of like I like the game like I like Driver 3.

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,040
It's a poorly put together game, and it has some blatant flaws in it, but it's okay.

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
It's just like what?

81
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
The same type of graphical stuff?

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Okay.

83
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,360
Let me put some examples in place here.

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,960
When I first started the game, immediately there was a big pileup of cars in the street

85
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,600
because they couldn't figure out how to turn the corner correctly.

86
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,240
So that was kind of funny.

87
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,080
The other thing is if you throw anything at anything in the game, you know, pretty much

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,800
like you can throw a road cone at a building.

89
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,560
Well, what happens is when you hit something with said road cone, shrapnel comes off the

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
building.

91
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,720
Well, that shrapnel hits another building and then more shrapnel comes off that building

92
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,040
and sometimes it goes back to the original building.

93
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,880
So you can literally destroy an entire block by just throwing a road cone at something.

94
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,360
And so that's kind of fascinating at the same time.

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
First comment of the night, Dark Tetsuya in our chat room says, Loki, testers not doing

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
their job?

97
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,040
Of course not.

98
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,300
It was definitely a rush game.

99
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,420
Is it that testers aren't doing their job or is it that testing gets their corners cut

100
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,520
because the game has a strict deadline of trying to be out in time to move?

101
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
I think it's probably corners cut.

102
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,220
That's what I figured.

103
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,400
But other stuff that's kind of crappy in the game, oh, the very first boss that I fought

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,200
in Autobot's campaign killed himself.

105
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Suicide man.

106
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,400
We were fighting in this, I don't even know what it's supposed to be, like a power plant

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,800
or something like that and they have all these explosive, I guess, propane tanks or something

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
all around.

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,820
And unfortunately, you set off one and the whole place goes up.

110
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,400
So he was just swinging this giant chain at me or something and I got knocked back by

111
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,640
the first propane blast and he got caught in the middle of all the other ones going

112
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,740
off at the same time.

113
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:55,960
So I actually never fired one shot at him and he ended up killing himself.

114
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,520
A lot of our chatters are big fans of Transformers, looking forward to the movie.

115
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
And I understand you actually got to see a little sneak peek of the movie.

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,840
I got to see the movie last Wednesday.

117
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Awesome.

118
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
How was it?

119
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
It was awesome.

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
Why?

121
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
What was awesome about it?

122
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,120
It was awesome because the action in the movie is just non-stop throughout the thing.

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,440
It's very similar to Independence Day, how it jumps back and forth between different

124
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,020
character story arcs and stuff like that.

125
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,440
So you've got that plus in the beginning of the movie when Scorponok comes out and stuff,

126
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,240
spears a guy through the chest and pulls him into the ground.

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,160
Right there I was like, fuck yeah, this is going to be awesome.

128
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,040
Any spoilers?

129
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,920
There is a couple of spoilers I was going to mention.

130
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,640
These are kind of cameos towards the end of the movie.

131
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,760
Remember that rumor going around that there was going to be an Xbox 360 robot in the movie?

132
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,760
There is, briefly, a cameo because the Allspark causes things to come alive.

133
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,120
So one of the things that happens to get set off by this is a 360, so you see this guy

134
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,640
carrying it out of a GameStop or something, but it busts out the side just for half a

135
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
second.

136
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,440
And then there is a Mountain Dew machine robot, which is funny, shooting cans at people, so

137
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,720
brief little cameos there.

138
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,060
But it is an excellent movie, highly recommended if you like action movies.

139
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,160
If you are looking for a deep story line or something like that, you are not going to

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,960
find it here, but it is good.

141
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,200
Okay, unfortunately we are radio and not television, so you can't really see everything that goes

142
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,620
on here in studio, but Rice Princess is making her patented Laura Roslin face.

143
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,740
And the Laura Roslin face is, if you've ever watched Battlestar Galactica, you know, what's

144
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
the actress' name?

145
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Mary McDonald?

146
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,740
Is that it?

147
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,740
I think that's what it is, yeah.

148
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,060
Like, you know, the actress, whenever something negative happens, she has this very distinct

149
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,520
look where she kind of scrunches up her nose and her mouth, and like Irene or Rice Princess

150
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,320
has that look down pat.

151
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,920
So when she's displeased with something, it's the Laura Roslin look.

152
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,920
So why are you giving this review of the Laura Roslin look?

153
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,760
Okay, the Xbox turning into a Transformer.

154
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,520
It's in there for like two seconds.

155
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
I know.

156
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
It's quick.

157
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,140
That's like subliminal advertising, like ew.

158
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,140
I mean, come on.

159
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,520
The cars that are in this movie are being used as advertising.

160
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,200
Yeah, but you didn't see an Xbox 360 in the original Transformers cartoon.

161
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Well, it's been updated.

162
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,920
They didn't want them to look all blocky and stupid like the cartoon.

163
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,520
That's okay, but there were cars in the original one, so of course there's going to be cars

164
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,480
in this one, but an Xbox 360, come on, Microsoft.

165
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,040
They don't even show the 360.

166
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,680
All they show is the white premium box and an arm punch out the side, you know, and that's

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,520
it and the guy drops it and it's there for literally one to two seconds.

168
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
I would drop it too because it's an Xbox.

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,600
I caught it, you know, real briefly, but a lot of people probably won't even notice it.

170
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,840
It does not detract from the film whatsoever.

171
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,480
It's not like, let's call Xbox 360 robot.

172
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
He will defeat everybody.

173
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,960
I mean, it's not anything like that at all.

174
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,640
So he will charge you, you know, 800 Microsoft points for every projectile that he throws.

175
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Exactly.

176
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
There are a few.

177
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,480
Yeah, it's a good movie.

178
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
I liked it.

179
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,640
I cannot wait to see it again.

180
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,640
I keep forgetting that Rice Princess is like really anti-Xbox and Microsoft.

181
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,480
Then remind me again real quick, why are you so-

182
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,120
I'm not super anti-Xbox and Microsoft.

183
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
I'm not.

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,520
I don't even know much about, you know, Microsoft to really hate them.

185
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,320
I just don't prefer them.

186
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,200
Like they're very underwhelming to me.

187
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,720
Didn't you tell me it has to do really with the games that they offer though, that there's

188
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,600
not a lot of like- That's what I'm saying, like I'm very underwhelmed

189
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,800
because they don't have anything to offer to me.

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,320
Everything appeals to me on that system.

191
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
You need to see the Eternal Sonata demo though if you haven't yet because that seems like

192
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
a Japanese RPG.

193
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,960
I have actually seen it and it does look really pretty and I would totally play it.

194
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,600
Maybe Blue Dragon in the future?

195
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,640
She made the Roslin face like a second ago, you're getting so good at that.

196
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
I know.

197
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,120
I've been practicing for a long time, but yeah, I don't know.

198
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,000
Blue Dragon might be cool, I don't know, we'll see, but definitely the other one looked really

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
good.

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,400
All right, anyhow, let's see, Ross Steel UT seems to agree with you in chat room.

201
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,160
Xbox 360 is all first person shooter.

202
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
It's not all first person shooter.

203
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,720
He also says, listen to Loki blindly defend a shitty unrelated marketing ploy.

204
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,760
It is a blatant ploy, but the whole movie has blatant product placement everywhere.

205
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,400
I mean come on, a fucking Mountain Dew robot.

206
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,680
Enough movie chat, game chat, sorry to interrupt your gaming week, but anyways, what else?

207
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,000
Other than that, actually I bought Nellie the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

208
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,120
for the Wii, which I might add has the worst cameras ever in a game, it's so awful, but

209
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
she likes it.

210
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
It's Harry Potter.

211
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,200
I think she actually finished it.

212
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,520
I forgot that was out.

213
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,840
Do you really cast spells with the Wiimote and everything?

214
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Heck yeah.

215
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
It's okay.

216
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,320
It's just the whole game, it sounds fun, you get to cast spells and stuff, but the whole

217
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,240
game is doing tasks for people.

218
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,600
It's like running around this stupid place and doing meaningless tasks like, I've lost

219
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,880
my stuff.

220
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,520
People have hidden it somewhere in Hogwarts.

221
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Go find it.

222
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,640
Well, thank you for giving me no hints whatsoever and Hogwarts isn't exactly small, so it takes

223
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,760
a lot of time and there's also a lot of things where if you forget what you're supposed to

224
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,600
be doing, you go back and ask them, they won't give you any hints to what you're supposed

225
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
to do or something like that.

226
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,120
A lot of the puzzles are hard to figure out what they want you to do.

227
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,360
The combat in the game using the wand and stuff is pretty stupid because Nellie didn't

228
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,160
really have a grasp on any sort of strategy, so she was just swinging the remote around

229
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,060
like crazy and it won every battle.

230
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,680
It's cool if you love Harry Potter, you'll definitely like the game.

231
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,920
I would recommend though, probably don't get it on the Wii, maybe get it on the 360 or

232
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,320
the Playstation 3.

233
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,600
The Wii-mote waving for your spells is not all that, it's not all that.

234
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,120
I'm not sure if in the normal, like the 360 and the Playstation 3, if you use the other

235
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,440
analog stick as maybe a camera look or something, but I know in the Wii version, it was hard

236
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,240
to even face in the right direction for certain things.

237
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,560
You'd be facing at what you want to cast a spell at, pull out your wand and you'd turn

238
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
around.

239
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,480
It's like, come on, what the hell?

240
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,120
It looks cool.

241
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,180
The other games I've been playing on the PSP, I actually Wipeout Pulse, which is not out

242
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,560
over here in the U.S. yet, but it's okay.

243
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
It's just like Wipeout.

244
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,840
I've played a lot of Wipeout Pure before and it's very similar to that.

245
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,160
Looks almost like a Playstation 2 game, but pretty awesome, so that's going to be coming

246
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,600
out in September.

247
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,520
The other game I've been playing is Final Fantasy, the remake on the PSP, and that's

248
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,200
actually really awesome looking.

249
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,960
You showed that to me and I played it for about 15 seconds and I'm so fucking sold

250
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
on it.

251
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,720
The game is freaking gorgeous.

252
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,800
The screenshots don't do it justice.

253
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
The game looks so beautiful.

254
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
It's amazing.

255
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,720
It's just amazing.

256
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,560
We're actually going to get married, me and the game.

257
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,880
You and Final Fantasy are going to get married?

258
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
We totally are.

259
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,080
We've already discussed this.

260
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:14,240
The last game I was playing was a game called Zainid Revolution, I think, and it's a sequel

261
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,160
to an Xbox shooter game, like one of the shoot-em-ups that came out probably very late in the Xbox

262
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,680
life cycle.

263
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
It's kind of different.

264
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,560
This one now is a 3D shooter.

265
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,240
You're kind of going towards the screen, I guess.

266
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,680
It's still got the shoot-em-up aspect stuff in the game, but after seeing games that are

267
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,520
free, like No Gravity and stuff, I'm sorry.

268
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,720
The background of the whole game is just a full motion video and you can see artifacts

269
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,000
and stuff, it's just not very good when a free game like No Gravity does everything

270
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,280
in real time and it looks amazing for no money.

271
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,720
So I'd probably hold off on buying that, but it's pretty cool, though.

272
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,960
Definitely get Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II when those come out.

273
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Awesome games.

274
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
All right.

275
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
I'll go next.

276
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,040
Ashley Rice Francis, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

277
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Okay.

278
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,800
My quite substantial gaming week that consists of just nothing, really.

279
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
You didn't play any games?

280
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
I played WoW.

281
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Oh, oh, oh!

282
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,160
Did we get into what we're doing with WoW?

283
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Go for it.

284
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,300
Why don't you tell us about what we're doing with WoW, since you play nothing but World

285
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
of Warcraft these days?

286
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,720
Yeah, pretty much, because I don't have time.

287
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,340
Now, just to say, because some folks might go, then why should I believe anything she

288
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,680
has to say about gaming, but that's just because your living situation right now, you just

289
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
don't have any...

290
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
I work two jobs.

291
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
I don't have time to game.

292
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Okay.

293
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
So shut your fucking face, people.

294
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Anyway...

295
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Why are you on this show?

296
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
I don't really know.

297
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
To say...

298
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
To cuss a lot.

299
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
I don't know.

300
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Okay.

301
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,160
But we're going to be creating a twink guild.

302
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
What's a twink guild?

303
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
It's a guild...

304
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,480
I know we've had this discussion on a previous show.

305
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,240
I'm not going to go to the porno-related side of this.

306
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Just tell us straight up.

307
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
What is this guild all about?

308
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
The guild's all about PvP.

309
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,160
We're going to be doing Mursangulch and Narathi Basin, and we're going to stay at level 29,

310
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,400
because it's like... so we can do AB, and it's the first one we can do it at.

311
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Everyone knows what twinks are.

312
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,600
They're just the really super awesome characters that have all the best gear and all the best

313
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,960
enchants and all that stuff, and we're going to make it based on Battlestar Galactica characters.

314
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,300
That's the nerdiest part, is everyone in the guild's named themselves after a character

315
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,800
from Battlestar Galactica, and the guild's called what?

316
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
The Frackers?

317
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
The Frackers.

318
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Isn't that the best thing ever?

319
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Stupidest thing ever.

320
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,760
You're the stupidest thing ever.

321
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,520
What level have you gotten your character up to for the PvP guild?

322
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,160
I haven't even made it yet, but we've been in discussions for it.

323
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,960
Even mine's level 6.

324
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,320
What's your name again?

325
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
It's Liadama.

326
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Liadama?

327
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Oh, you nerd!

328
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Liadama's mine.

329
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
Shut up.

330
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
You shut up.

331
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,480
Mine's going to be Tyrrell, because he's hot and sexy and nobody likes him, except for

332
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
me.

333
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,560
So I'm like, whatever, I'll take his name.

334
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,600
Who else do we have in our PvP guild?

335
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
A lot.

336
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,240
I'm pretty sure there's a Roslin.

337
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I think...

338
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,400
I don't know if there is a Roslin.

339
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,520
One of our guilds said they wanted to be a real bitch, so we said do Admiral Cain.

340
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,440
Yeah, oh my god, isn't that the best thing ever?

341
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
She's my hero.

342
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,400
So that's pretty much it on my end of the gaming week.

343
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,240
Alright, let's see.

344
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,280
Rasteel UTS, some advice.

345
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,640
Price Princess, you might have time to game if you didn't upset over that useless time

346
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
sink.

347
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,760
In other words, stop playing WoW in your other games.

348
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh man, that was hilarious.

349
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
Because you're never going to get away from WoW, huh?

350
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Not really, no.

351
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
She's giving me Roslin face.

352
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,200
Let's see, my gaming week actually sadly was pretty similar.

353
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,320
I didn't play a whole lot outside of WoW, but I have a good reason, because I was out

354
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
of town for three days.

355
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,040
I was in LA and I had to do this thing for work where we stayed all together for this

356
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,400
team building thing away from the society, so I couldn't even get out to an arcade or

357
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,920
a bar or anything, so not a whole lot of time I had to game.

358
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,400
When I was able to play some of the games outside of World of Warcraft, I did play some

359
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:16,240
stuff on the DS, still playing Puzzle Quest, that game is fun, and I'm hoping to beat it.

360
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,360
And also, even though this isn't a video game, it scores me a ton of nerd points.

361
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,240
I've been playing Survivor, like the TV show, I've been playing Survivor on LiveJournal.

362
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,080
Because a lot of people play Dungeons and Dragons online, so there's Survivor on LiveJournal,

363
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,920
so I'm playing that.

364
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,960
I wasn't the first voted out, thank God.

365
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,400
There you go.

366
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,520
I was very happy about that.

367
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
That's pretty much it.

368
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,320
I haven't been playing a lot else with my gaming week, although I did check out that

369
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,200
Final Fantasy I when Loki let me borrow it for a little bit, and boy, that game looks

370
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
sexy.

371
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,200
I'm going to have to find my PSP and dust it off seriously with Final Fantasy I, II,

372
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Tactics, Castlevania.

373
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,040
A lot of folks that were dishing out the PSP hate because it didn't have the types of games

374
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,360
they were looking for.

375
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,740
It's finally coming, a lot of those types of the role-playings and the ports of classics

376
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
that we love.

377
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
Yeah.

378
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
There you go.

379
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,960
I was kind of having, I was dishing out PSP uncertainty because there wasn't really, again,

380
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,140
it was kind of like the Xbox.

381
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,900
There was nothing that was really appealing to me except for Luminous, but now I'm seeing

382
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,760
all these games and I'm totally going to invest in one.

383
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
All right.

384
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Yep.

385
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
I thought I'd interject with that.

386
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
All right.

387
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
All right.

388
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Well, let's see.

389
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,800
Now that we've gone through our gaming weeks, perhaps we should get into some housekeeping

390
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,200
tonight and tell you guys about what's going on with us.

391
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,540
We are going to be making an appearance at SAC for Sacramento Anime.

392
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:53,040
We're going to be going to that convention, which is, I believe, two weeks off.

393
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,520
I think we're going to be making an appearance on Saturday, the 14th.

394
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,560
And for those of you that are in the Sacramento area, it's at that hotel that's across Martin

395
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Fair Mall.

396
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,960
All the details we will have next week, we're still trying to work that out with the folks

397
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,000
and I need to make sure even all of us are available or else it's only going to be some

398
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
of us.

399
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,800
However, we will not be taping one of our live usual shows at this convention as we

400
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,000
did for Fanime.

401
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,920
We will be recording a special bonus show that only folks on the live journal, the MySpace,

402
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,120
our communities, will be able to direct download.

403
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
It will not go into the RSS feed.

404
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,640
So if you are interested in keeping tabs on all that type of special stuff that we put

405
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,360
out that's extra, check out our live journal community, which is Orange Lounge on Live

406
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,900
Journal, or you can check out our MySpace.

407
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,600
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on MySpace.

408
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,000
You think I just learned English this week.

409
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What the hell is going on?

410
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You did.

411
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You did.

412
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Geez.

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,240
Well, you know, because last week was the five-year anniversary and all, now this week,

414
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
we're just set up for disappointment.

415
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Like, who gives a fuck anniversary?

416
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Exactly.

417
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Who gives a fuck anymore?

418
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,760
I'm surprised we're here.

419
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,020
When you're at the top, you got to have to bring it down a notch and like gradually go

420
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,200
down a bit so that you can bring it back up.

421
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,240
For 250 because, you know, 250 is a landmark number so you have to bring it up again for

422
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
that.

423
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Totally right.

424
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Anyway.

425
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Let's see.

426
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Other housekeeping.

427
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Happy Canada Day.

428
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,020
To all our Canadians that are listening, we are taping on July the 1st.

429
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,120
So happy Canada Day.

430
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
To you.

431
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,600
It's my six-year anniversary today too.

432
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Is it?

433
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
No.

434
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,400
It's the first time that we started dating.

435
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Was July 1st, really?

436
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Yes.

437
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Honestly, it's not like your marriage was in April.

438
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
No.

439
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
No.

440
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
We didn't go through some weird time.

441
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,640
You know my parents' anniversary is July 1st too.

442
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,200
So happy anniversary, Mommy and Daddy, because they got married on July 1st.

443
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,560
And also this week, since it will be this week, to all the American folks that listen,

444
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,320
happy 4th of July.

445
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,220
And to celebrate our anniversary, we're getting a kitty.

446
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
Are you really?

447
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
Yeah, we're getting a kitty.

448
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
What are you going to name it?

449
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,200
Well, the two things that I thought I'd never do, and that's the two things I would never

450
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,720
do, buy an Apple product and get a cat because I'm a dog person.

451
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,920
But we're getting a cat.

452
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm not buying an Apple product ever.

453
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Not an iPhone?

454
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
I know.

455
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
One of our friends got an iPhone.

456
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
They're pretty sexy.

457
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,600
It was bringing sexy back.

458
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,320
Just knowing Apple, there will be something even better next year.

459
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320
So I'm going to hold off and hopefully I'll have money because I'm moving soon.

460
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,960
Actually, also the countdown is beginning for the last shows in the studio.

461
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,280
We're going to be moving to a new room because I'm moving to a new place and hopefully a

462
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
bigger studio.

463
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,760
I hope so.

464
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,060
And definitely there will be a webcam in the new studio.

465
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,800
So that's something to look forward to.

466
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,360
Those shows will debut in August.

467
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,880
I think we're going to take a week off while we switch over.

468
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,440
And then in August, probably going to hopefully change a lot.

469
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,720
I'm hoping we're just going to do a new season, kind of redo Orange Lounge for the new studio

470
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
and everything.

471
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
It will be fun.

472
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,480
Our new kitty is going to be, she's four months old and her name is Stella.

473
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Stella.

474
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,040
You already named it?

475
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
No, we didn't name it.

476
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,880
It's a foster cat right now.

477
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
It's in a foster home.

478
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,240
So we are going to be picking it up on Friday.

479
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,360
Jake Simmons says, name it Kitty Bobo.

480
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,480
And Rosteal UT says, name it Tingle.

481
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,880
There you go.

482
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,520
Can't name it Tingle.

483
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,800
It responds to Stella.

484
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,480
We'll see about nicknames.

485
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Alright.

486
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,040
Also, I wanted to mention this real quickly.

487
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,640
You're going to be hearing this a lot, especially those of you guys that listen to a variety

488
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,120
of podcasts.

489
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,440
You're really going to get sick of hearing this after this month is over.

490
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,440
So we're really only going to say this once, but it is that time of year.

491
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,560
The podcast awards are open and nominations have started as of today.

492
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,560
And of course, we would be tickled pink if we could get nominated again this year.

493
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,480
If you want to nominate us, you go over to podcastawards.com.

494
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,360
If you need to know our feed URL, there's actually a thread in our forums and I'll link

495
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
that in chat shortly.

496
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,960
It has all the details.

497
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,800
Obviously, we would very much appreciate a nomination for best gaming or best people's

498
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,780
choice, whatever you want.

499
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,400
But if there's a podcast you like better, that's a gaming podcast, hey, no problem.

500
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,000
All we really want to see is the independent podcast prevail in this.

501
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,760
And last year, even though we weren't nominated, we were very happy to see that five independent

502
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
podcasts were nominated.

503
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,400
And that's the way we want to keep it because you know what, guys?

504
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,800
Those podcasts that are owned by the corporates and the big game companies and the big gaming

505
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,000
magazines, they don't need the exposure.

506
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,720
They have lots of ad dollars that go into their print, their TV.

507
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,200
They don't need the exposure.

508
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,440
But the independent folks, a podcast award can really help them out because when we won

509
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,680
it in 2005, it really did help us out.

510
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,620
So please make sure an independent wins it, guys.

511
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,920
If it can't be us, we definitely would like to see another independent win it.

512
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,480
So there you have it, podcast awards.

513
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,280
The nominations are open, I think, through the 15th.

514
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,560
And I'm hoping that people will suggest independent podcasts from other categories in our thread

515
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,600
on the forums to maybe nominate because I don't know a lot outside of gaming.

516
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600
I know a couple sci-fi and a couple, but not a lot.

517
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,480
So I'm hoping we can kind of share and help promote the indie podcasts.

518
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Totally.

519
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
That would be cool.

520
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
All right.

521
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,080
Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's gaming news.

522
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
Yes.

523
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,680
Not a huge surprise, especially with E3 around the corner.

524
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,520
We're getting a lot of announcements of what's going to be coming out at E3, what you can

525
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,280
expect to be reading about because obviously most of you probably aren't going, including

526
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
us.

527
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
Fucking people.

528
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,440
Anyways, so one of those, which isn't a big surprise and I'm surprised we haven't seen

529
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,480
more of it yet, Killzone 2, Sony's invite for, I believe, their press conference and

530
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,660
whatnot was, of course, Killzone themed and they're probably going to be featuring the

531
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,000
game playable or in some sort of trailer.

532
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm guessing playable.

533
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,040
I mean, it's got to be coming out pretty soon at the event.

534
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:45,140
So hopefully soon we'll see some more on Killzone 2 and see if it's really this big game that

535
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,800
everyone's claiming it to be, or at least everyone in Sony camp.

536
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Interesting.

537
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, we won't really know much about E3 this year because we aren't going, not that we're

538
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
bitter or anything.

539
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
No.

540
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Completely.

541
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Whatever.

542
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,840
It's going to be on the internet within five seconds anyway.

543
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,800
And we've seen enough of how the gaming industry works on the inside that what's really going

544
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,080
to happen is that the game companies will sell the rights to one of those big box gaming

545
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
companies.

546
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,240
And the big box gaming companies will actually post it the day before E3, meaning that all

547
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,120
the independent press who actually manages to get into E3 has to run their stories 48

548
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
hours late.

549
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
That's the way it's really going to work.

550
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
So you know what?

551
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,160
We're just going to stay at home and steal other people's articles this year because

552
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
hey, it's the American way.

553
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,680
All I know is when these press conferences will be going on, I will not be doing much

554
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,080
work at my desk because that's usually the case.

555
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm usually just getting refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh.

556
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, news!

557
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Read it.

558
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh, refresh.

559
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,240
Can you watch them live like last year or is it because it's not as big a, you know,

560
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,400
that's low key, can't watch that stuff live this year?

561
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,240
I can, but at the work, you know, a lot of the internet's blocked.

562
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,100
So a lot of the, you know, unless they're streaming it straight off their site and off

563
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,320
something else, you know, most likely I can't watch it live.

564
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
But who cares?

565
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,560
You know, if I can read about it, that's all I really care about.

566
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,880
I don't think I've told you this.

567
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
I'll have to tell you a little more, give you details offhand.

568
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,680
But one of our other folks that works for Orange Launch Radio on one of the other weeknight

569
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,240
shows, actually had some touch with a game company this week and that game company said

570
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,520
they'd invite us to E3, but now it's like too late.

571
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,200
It's like E3's only 10 days away, I'm like, great, now we got a possible invite and now

572
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
it's too freaking late.

573
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Aww.

574
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
I know, that sucks.

575
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
But oh well, maybe next year.

576
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,920
I don't know, weekend I'd drive my ass down there.

577
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
I know.

578
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
That's the problem.

579
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
It's like I've already now made commitments of a day job.

580
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,480
Originally I was trying to keep that time open because I thought maybe something would

581
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
come through.

582
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,360
Well, you know, I'm not too worried about it because all those demos that are going

583
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,680
to be there at E3 are going to be at E4ALL or PAX or whatever we end up going to next

584
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,060
and big deal.

585
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,280
I sadly can't go to PAX because of a wedding, but I hope somebody from the Orange Launch

586
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,880
Radio staff is able to go up there.

587
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,320
E4ALL I'm definitely going to though.

588
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,800
I'm trying to make it to E4ALL.

589
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,920
I don't know if I'll end up making it out there, but I would like to go because it would

590
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,560
be nice to see that stuff.

591
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,760
Will Rice Princess be going to any of these big gaming conventions?

592
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
I want to go to BlizzCon.

593
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
BlizzCon?

594
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,080
I can't though because all the tickets sold out within what, fucking four days or something

595
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
like that?

596
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Why does that not surprise me?

597
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
I know.

598
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
I think about four hours.

599
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Four hours, really?

600
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
Days, hours, doesn't matter.

601
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,920
Yeah, I'm really sad about that, but whatever.

602
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,640
I'll go next year.

603
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,040
DS68 says the SF Bay area needs a gaming convention, damn it.

604
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,600
I agree, except there is a whole game developers conference, which is kind of a big deal.

605
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,280
If you remember though, they did try to do something like that.

606
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,640
Remember there was that one convention that was in San Francisco, it was a weekend, and

607
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,640
I don't remember what exactly it was.

608
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,720
I want to say it wasn't sponsored.

609
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,200
It might have been sponsored by GameSpa, like a GameSpot expo or something like that.

610
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,640
TechTV used to be there.

611
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,920
Was it Davis' own GameSpa one time?

612
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
No.

613
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Hello.

614
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
No, I'm crazy.

615
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,880
I think GamePro or something.

616
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,680
There was a GameSpot expo, I want to say, that was in San Francisco.

617
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
It was really small.

618
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:09,160
They only had maybe 15 publishers out there, but from what I remember reading, there wasn't

619
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,480
that much response to it.

620
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
It was pretty crappy.

621
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,120
Besides, we're being totally selfish because obviously the SF Bay area is pretty much in

622
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
our backyard.

623
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,000
It's about two hours away, so it's totally drivable, but I'm sure everybody's like,

624
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,620
I wish they'd have a gaming convention in my part of town.

625
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:28,200
But the good news is, usually there's at least something small-ish in any type of town, even

626
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,440
if it's like an anime slash game convention, which you see a lot of everywhere.

627
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,160
I would rather go to Gamers' Days over the giant E3s any day.

628
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,840
At least you get more one-on-one time with games.

629
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Usually.

630
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
I kind of agree.

631
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,160
Was it the first Konami Gamers' Day that we went to?

632
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,520
That was pretty low-key and we got to play pretty much everything.

633
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,760
The last one though, not so much because of too much press and the place was kind of smaller

634
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,640
and it seemed like, well, we got to get the shot for our TV show, get out of the way type

635
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
of shit.

636
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,200
Everyone's kind of there to do jobs instead of report stuff.

637
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, anyhow, obviously one big announcement that came out of E3, actually, I want to read

638
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
a chat comment here.

639
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,360
GS191 is correcting me here.

640
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,100
Well, actually CNET is actually owned by Ziff Davis, so GameSpot by Proxy is.

641
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,100
So interesting.

642
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
I didn't realize that.

643
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
All right.

644
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
Moving on.

645
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Oh, sorry.

646
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,960
I keep reading chat and I see new stuff pop up.

647
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,520
There was a big convention this weekend that might be a little bit near and dear to our

648
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,240
hearts and the folks have been listening to us from the beginning.

649
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,600
Bolmani Fest was this weekend on the East Coast, which is, of course, this big Bebomani

650
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,820
and Beatmania and DDR convention that's on the East Coast.

651
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,000
They have it at a bowling alley, hence the term Bolmani, which is cute.

652
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,720
And they actually get, usually, some folks that are actually in the games to come out

653
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
there and perform.

654
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,920
That's cute.

655
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,720
I wish I was at the East Coast like a couple of weeks later than I was.

656
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,200
Maybe I could have gone.

657
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
Anyhow, big conventions.

658
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,400
Last year, one of the big things we saw at E3 was Final Fantasy XIII and, of course,

659
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,520
everybody wants to know when.

660
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,160
When will we get this game?

661
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,520
Well, Square Enix has actually said that they will be doing no games for the PlayStation

662
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,820
3 until after April 1st of 2008.

663
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,060
Why then?

664
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,760
Because that's the new fiscal year.

665
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,400
There will be no games from Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 this fiscal year.

666
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,160
Not a big surprise as far as Final Fantasy XIII is regarded.

667
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,880
I think most of us here in the U.S. were thinking we'd be lucky to see it at the end of 2008

668
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,500
with all the translation and stuff that has to go on.

669
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
But there it is.

670
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,360
That's really sad, though, when you think about it because Sony really needs some strong

671
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,960
titles to come out in order to be able to push this PlayStation 3 to the level that

672
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,760
the 360 and the Wii are right now.

673
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,800
We're hoping for Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid IV in both those now or after March

674
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,360
of next year.

675
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,620
Missed another Christmas.

676
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,280
That's not good.

677
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,400
That's going to really put them behind.

678
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,740
I don't think they're going to be able to catch up.

679
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:07,280
It's going to have to be one of those one in a million shots that's going to turn around.

680
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,400
So what's Sony going to push this Christmas?

681
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Little Big Planet, Home?

682
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
The same stuff we saw?

683
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Home, Little Big Planet.

684
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Killzone?

685
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Killzone?

686
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I don't know what you're talking about this year.

687
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
There's no way.

688
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
I guess that's true.

689
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,360
You're probably looking at the second quarter of next year, but I would say this year probably

690
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,840
Heavenly Sword because that's pretty much God of War on the PlayStation 3 anyways.

691
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,160
Lair is going to be good and probably some unannounced stuff.

692
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Ratchet and Clank.

693
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
The new Ratchet and Clank.

694
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
It looks awesome.

695
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,620
I mean, same people did Resistance and that game was sweet, so I don't know.

696
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,080
It's going to be hard for them.

697
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,160
Thomas says, we'll see Final Fantasy 13 before Duke Nukem Forever.

698
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Very true.

699
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Probably.

700
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Oh my God.

701
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,760
I can't wait for the day when Duke Nukem Forever is actually going to come out.

702
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,520
Frisbee calls it Final Fantasy Sporever.

703
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Get it?

704
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
Because Spore is also delayed.

705
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,420
It's just been delayed a few years or something.

706
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,600
These are all games that people cannot freaking wait for.

707
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,840
Well, Spore that we've seen playable in some form, and you know what, it's just a very

708
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,880
large game and they have to make sure that it's going to be everything that they want

709
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,720
to be before they release it.

710
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,800
It's just like Fable 2.

711
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
It's just like Fable 2.

712
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,240
Fable 2 is probably going to be delayed forever because they want to make sure that it's perfect.

713
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
And you know what?

714
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:33,040
I'd rather them be perfect than have another Transformers game come out or Spiderman 3.

715
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,520
One thing that's definitely not been perfect is the brand new firmwares for the PSP.

716
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,900
Not one firmware so far released has been able to be not hacked and such is the case

717
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,080
with 3.5.

718
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:56,400
In fact, last week they found a new kind of work around called the Illuminati and basically

719
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,800
uses the old Luminous to run Homebrew code.

720
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,240
And of course, immediately after that came out, there is now a 3.5 down grader so you

721
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:14,320
can down grade your PSP to be able to run either 1.5 so you can run Homebrew that way

722
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,840
or to be able to run custom firmwares, which you know, custom firmwares are the way to

723
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
go I think.

724
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,340
Other interesting things though, because of the Illuminati exploit, the Luminous sales

725
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,120
have skyrocketed about 14,000%.

726
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,060
So a lot of people are picking up Luminous, which you know, it's a great game anyways,

727
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,880
but it might be a little harder to find it if you don't have it already.

728
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,320
Well, most people were ignoring Luminous 1 because Luminous 2 was out now and I doubt

729
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,880
Q Entertainment is making a lot of those, or whoever, who published that one actually?

730
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Was it Q?

731
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,800
Or was it Sony actually published it?

732
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,080
It was Q, but I think Ubisoft published it.

733
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Wow, okay.

734
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,000
But you know, Ubisoft has been making a lot of copies of that probably because of Luminous

735
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
2.

736
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I don't think it's available anymore.

737
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,400
I don't think so either, but people are trying to scrounge them up now.

738
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:09,060
Also on Sony platform's much anticipated Guitar Hero rocks the 80s and they've done a brilliant

739
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,760
job over at Activision of keeping this game in the press every week before it's released

740
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,760
because they'll give you a few more songs this week, a few more songs, a few more songs.

741
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,260
Well finally we know the whole dang song list because we've got some more songs this week

742
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
and that's it.

743
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,960
We've got the whole song list.

744
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,200
Caught in a Mosh by Anthrax is in the game.

745
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,960
I'm only going to read the songs I care about.

746
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,000
Police Truck by the Dead Kennedys.

747
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,040
We Got the Beat by the Go-Go's and I love this one, I Think I'm Turning Japanese by

748
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
the Vapers.

749
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Awesome.

750
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
That's great.

751
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,620
That's going to be a great Guitar Hero song.

752
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,480
Why are you making Rosalind Face, Rice Princess?

753
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,900
Because the song list sucks.

754
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
You don't like the song list?

755
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,900
I don't like it at all.

756
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
There's some other stuff though that was already announced.

757
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
I read the whole song list.

758
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
You read the whole thing?

759
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
Yeah.

760
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
I agree.

761
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,900
They could have done a little better.

762
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
What were you hoping for?

763
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:58,080
For like better 80s music that wasn't all just like hair bands and just like crap like

764
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
that.

765
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
She's very diverse.

766
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Paula Abdul?

767
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
Yes.

768
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
But there's no guitar solos there.

769
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
She's very famous for guitar solos.

770
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
I know.

771
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,080
Then what?

772
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
I don't know.

773
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Hair bands were guitar solos.

774
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
I don't know.

775
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,720
I mean like just something a little more eclectic.

776
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,440
I don't have any like, I don't know, examples right now, but I don't know.

777
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,280
Raw Steel UT in chat says Guitar Hero 80 sucks.

778
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,560
It doesn't have We're Not Gonna Take It or Money for Nothing.

779
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,960
Twisted Sister would be pretty awesome.

780
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
True.

781
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Actually Twisted Sister I think is in the band.

782
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
It's just the wrong song.

783
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,600
Let's see.

784
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Rama says Guitar Hero needs Weird Al.

785
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,040
Frisbee says Elite Beat Agents was going to have Weird Al.

786
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,760
That was also a song list that turned out to be fake.

787
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,560
I don't know if that was ever actually going to be in the band I think or in the game.

788
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
I think somebody just kind of pulled that out of their butt.

789
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,620
Money for Nothing would be fucking awesome.

790
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,620
I agree.

791
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,800
That would be cool.

792
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,720
Drunami says give us Bohemian Rhapsody.

793
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,720
I think that was 70s though.

794
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Yeah.

795
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
It'd be too long.

796
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
79 or 78.

797
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,680
All right, well there you have it, Guitar Hero 80s edition.

798
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,480
Those of you guys that do like the air bands, I'm sure you're very excited about that.

799
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,440
Anyways, since E3 is right around the corner, not too surprising we're starting to get leaked

800
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,820
lists from E3.

801
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,200
This course should be of interest to everybody.

802
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,200
The Konami E3 list was leaked out.

803
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,040
Looks like coming from a tip to Xbox Live Radio or XBL Radio who is another affiliate

804
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,160
on AllGames.com just like us.

805
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Awesome.

806
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:31,240
Some stuff, of course, not too surprising, DDR Supernova 2 for PlayStation 2, Universe

807
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:37,520
2 for the 360, Karaoke Revolution American Idol 2 for the PlayStation 2, a game called

808
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,640
DDR Disney Challenge for the PlayStation 2.

809
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,160
Let's see here what else we got.

810
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,480
DDR Disney Challenge?

811
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Because I thought I read a report somewhere else.

812
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,800
I don't know, I was following up with it that said something Disney Channel.

813
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,320
It probably is Disney Channel or something.

814
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,640
Disney Challenge sounds kind of weird unless it's like all hard stuff, whatever.

815
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,360
There's this weird game called Girls Secret Diary for the DS.

816
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,880
Record your secrets and dreams in your journal.

817
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,600
I can't wait.

818
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Is that a game that will finally tear you away from Wow, Girls Secret Diary?

819
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Yeah.

820
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Oh my God.

821
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,920
I don't know why, but that game starts to sound like Ping Pals to me and I get very

822
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,640
worried because Ping Pals is shitatious.

823
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,080
It should have Girls Secret Diary like RPG or something.

824
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,560
I think you're just bitter because it's Girls Secret Diary and that means you can't use

825
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
it, Rob.

826
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,120
And you're like, oh fine, it just sounds like Ping Pals anyway, meh, meh, meh.

827
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Shut up.

828
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
You shut up.

829
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Shut your face up.

830
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,720
No, I'm totally not going to get that.

831
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,760
But you know, I'm sure we'll find out more, me and Avery's like what, just over a week

832
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
away.

833
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Come on, folks.

834
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,880
It's around the corner that the PlayStation 2 is going to kind of have their year or two

835
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,400
of being the budget system, you know, because it's so cheap and most of the games are probably

836
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,960
going to fall to $19.99, $29.99, so like a Disney game on PlayStation 2 kind of makes

837
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,840
a lot of sense to me because, you know, who's going to have the PlayStation 2 now is the

838
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
young kids.

839
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
Exactly.

840
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
That's a perfect...

841
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,080
Mommy and Daddy are buying systems for us.

842
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,080
It's a perfect title for a $29.99 price point.

843
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,280
All right, well even though we might be seeing DDR on the PlayStation 2 soon, the PlayStation

844
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,360
3 is going to be getting another long time series coming to it.

845
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,080
Wipeout Pulse is going to be coming out.

846
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe has been showing this off for the past few weeks

847
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,940
over there in London.

848
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:37,680
Now Wipeout Pulse is going to be a high def version of Wipeout and it's going to be released

849
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:44,640
in 2008, but hopefully we're going to get to see some hints at the game at E3.

850
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Whoop-a-dee-doo.

851
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,240
I mean, okay, it's high def.

852
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:53,040
If the whole thing was pretty much cel-shaded anyways, I mean, it's not like upping the

853
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,840
textures are going to make it any better or anything, but hey, cool.

854
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,360
I'm sure it will use the six axis and all that fun stuff.

855
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,880
As long as we get some great raving soundtracks like all the other games, that will be great.

856
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,040
Pulse' soundtrack is actually pretty cool.

857
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,440
Some other interesting stuff coming from the Sony Cam.

858
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,360
This one though in India, and unfortunately we're not going to see an advertising campaign

859
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,240
like this over here, but oh my God, I wish it was.

860
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:26,120
Apparently, they have a new advertising campaign that is a little bit chauvinistic, I guess.

861
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,680
Let me just really quickly read the entire ad.

862
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,560
Sherry is such a bitch.

863
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,080
Last night, I saw her with this weird guy whom I think she's seen.

864
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:43,640
I mean, she created such a scene when she broke up with Josie, bloody attention seeker.

865
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,160
It's not been a week and she's already sleeping around.

866
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
You know what?

867
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,840
I think Nicole is two-timing Ron again.

868
00:38:51,840 --> 00:39:00,560
In the very bottom, it says, PlayStation 2, because your girlfriend bores you shitless.

869
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
That's funny.

870
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
How do we do that here?

871
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
That's really funny.

872
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,320
People would be pissed off and get offended and stuff.

873
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,280
Are you offended as a woman?

874
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,600
I'm offended it's not being advertised here because that's one of the best advertisements

875
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,560
ever because it's so true.

876
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,280
Of course, Sony likes to make the controversial ads.

877
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,480
Remember the whole PSP ad, the whole white and black thing that was like, oh my gosh,

878
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
pushed everybody's butts.

879
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
I love this one.

880
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
It shows this guy.

881
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:37,520
It looks like he's from Schoolhouse Rocks and he's just sitting there slouching like

882
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,040
I don't give a shit while his girlfriend's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.

883
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
So that was kind of funny.

884
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,560
Ross Steele, UT in chat, says, and then we wonder why women don't play video games.

885
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,720
Yes, that's the only reason why because gaming companies make offensive advertisement.

886
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,680
Most women I know would see the offensive advertisement and then go, well, if they're

887
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,880
going to be like that, then I'm going to play lots of video games.

888
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
I'll show them.

889
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
I don't have to be boring.

890
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Well, it could be like, you know.

891
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,160
Then they'll realize how terrible they are at video games and then they'll stop.

892
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,360
PlayStation 2, if your boyfriend can't satisfy you, rez will.

893
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:15,160
I mean, there's a great ad campaign as well.

894
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,200
I can't wait to see the ad campaigns for Soul Calibur IV, especially, you know, being that

895
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:27,160
the IVs, IVs, slutatious boobs are being shown off in the trailer massive side boob

896
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
in those pictures.

897
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,180
There is massive side boob in those pictures and a massive bombshell drop this week in

898
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,560
regards to Soul Calibur IV.

899
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,360
First, the game is coming out next year on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and, you know,

900
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,640
Tekken is online now.

901
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,540
So Hello Namco, is Soul Calibur IV going to be online?

902
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,240
And the answer is yes.

903
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,560
And that quote comes from Namco.

904
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,240
It says, quote, with the current environment, we really couldn't make Soul Calibur IV without

905
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,520
online play.

906
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,720
That's from the director, Katsutoshi Sasaki, who makes Soul Calibur IV.

907
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,860
So that's exciting because I know a lot of folks like to play their online games.

908
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,400
Hopefully there is not some crappy lag.

909
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,720
That would be bad because crappy lag always ruins those online fighting games.

910
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,080
But I actually remember reading some other unrelated story this week that talked about

911
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,720
like a lag-free system for fighting games that have been developed that's supposed to

912
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,800
like eliminate practically all the lag that you see in fighting games.

913
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,060
I don't know how well it works, but maybe Soul Calibur IV will be able to implement

914
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,060
some of this technology.

915
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,060
Who knows?

916
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,400
I think it's a myth, kind of like those cars that run on air or something like that, you

917
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,360
know, the magical cars that, you know, zero emissions and, you know, fuel would be plentiful

918
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,560
and it's all a myth.

919
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,800
What's interesting though, this announcement just came out recently.

920
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,600
Apparently the Bourne conspiracy is going to be coming to Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

921
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:03,080
Now it is based on the Jason Bourne character from the book series and not necessarily from

922
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,280
the movie series even though the Bourne...

923
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,280
So Matt Damon?

924
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
No, Matt Damon.

925
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,320
So, you know, same character, you know, not based on the movie though.

926
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,360
It is due out summer 2008.

927
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,600
It's going to be developed by High Moon Studios, which you might remember they did a game a

928
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,560
couple years back called Darkwatch, a vampire western game.

929
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,480
It looks pretty cool though so far, but still a ways away.

930
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,740
Maybe some more details will be coming out from E3, so.

931
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,480
We're getting some feedback on the last story because, you know, sometimes there's a little

932
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,080
bit of lag here between chat and what we're taping live.

933
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,480
Of course chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

934
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,600
Toshan is in chat and says this is not a myth, the whole lag-free fighting thing we're talking

935
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
about.

936
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,000
He says, my friend made it, FYI, ggpo.net.

937
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,800
Interesting.

938
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I guess we'll see.

939
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,680
Let's see how well it's implemented.

940
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,160
I haven't seen any videos of it in action yet or gotten to use it myself, but the prospects

941
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
of it sound very exciting.

942
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Don't get me wrong.

943
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,720
Moving on to another title that's having another version coming out.

944
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,720
TimeSplitters 4 is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3.

945
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,840
TimeSplitters kind of seems to, it's not a game you hear about a lot, but a lot of folks

946
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,800
that have played this game seem to really enjoy it.

947
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,440
You're a TimeSplitters fan, aren't you, Loki?

948
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,400
I love TimeSplitters, I cannot wait for this.

949
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,800
TimeSplitters is probably hands down one of the best first person shooter games out there,

950
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,520
especially TimeSplitters 2, which is, it's fun.

951
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,520
That's it.

952
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:38,000
The whole game focuses on multiplayer deathmatches and create your own levels and weird mini

953
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,400
games and stuff like you can race a cat in the third one.

954
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,280
It's just an awesome game.

955
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,480
By the way, if you're skeptical, this was confirmed in the latest edition of the official

956
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,120
Playstation Magazine in the UK, obviously the US one is not around anymore.

957
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,200
The forum post that originally tipped people off to this also says about the article, there's

958
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,420
no actual news on the features other than Steve Ellis says, quote, they're gearing up

959
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,520
to insert monkeys and guns into all the wrong places.

960
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Awesome.

961
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,560
Yeah, that game had lots of monkeys.

962
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,440
I'll make Loki very happy.

963
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,880
Some other interesting stuff, a lot of people have been, of course, overclocking their PSPs

964
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,040
with the home brew scene, especially with the custom firmwares out there.

965
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,560
Although, one of the things that people found out is with the new version 3.5 firmware,

966
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:39,640
I believe, they actually can tap the full speed of the system, which is about 50% faster.

967
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,480
The first game that's going to be doing this, though, is God of War Chains of Olympus.

968
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,640
It's going to be running at the full speed on there because obviously the game's going

969
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,800
to be quite graphically intensive.

970
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,600
Interesting to see that they're actually finally kind of say, fuck battery life, we're just

971
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:03,080
going to use the full speed of the system.

972
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,840
Why is it that folks don't want to use the full speed of the system normally?

973
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,480
I don't understand the way that works.

974
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,040
Originally, it's because it cut down on battery life, so they couldn't advertise

975
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,680
that the battery lasts X amount of time.

976
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,600
Originally, they could run it at the full speed.

977
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,600
In fact, you can overclock yours to run at 333 megahertz instead of 222.

978
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,640
In fact, that's what we do for playing Grand Theft Auto, so it's smoother, less load

979
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,120
time, but I don't know.

980
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,920
It's just their choice, I guess, they don't want to do it.

981
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,880
Well our chat room, of course, we're a little bit behind apparently because they're still

982
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,520
reacting to the last story and they're talking about the racing cats and act-def says, we

983
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,720
don't want monkeys, we want laser cats because remember we talked about laser cats, the game

984
00:45:51,720 --> 00:46:00,360
and how somebody badly needs to make that, and then the chat room says that they actually

985
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,920
want rap cats.

986
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:08,060
Kill me now.

987
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:12,140
There was some other interesting music that came out a little bit later on, also this

988
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:19,120
whole hacking the Fermars and stuff, they found that 3.5 and 3.51 have an official ISO

989
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:27,680
loader, so Sony is actually going to be enabling you to run games off the memory sticks.

990
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,180
So they're going to either have a way to dump games to the memory stick or you're going

991
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,520
to have a new download service where you're going to be able to download games to run

992
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,880
straight off the memory stick, even though they kind of do that with demos right now,

993
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,640
but it is an official ISO loader which apparently is going to be included in the next home brew

994
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,840
firmware that's going to be made.

995
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,840
The plot thickens.

996
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,600
All right, well anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.

997
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,080
Even though Dark Soccer isn't here this week, we're going to sneak behind her back and open

998
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,240
up the emailbag because we can't wait.

999
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,360
We're like kids on Christmas Eve, we can't wait to open up our presents and when you

1000
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,840
guys send us emails every week at mailbag at orangehonestradio.com, they are like little

1001
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
presents.

1002
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,000
So let's open up the mailbag.

1003
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,080
All right, not a whole lot of emails this week, I think because a lot of folks actually

1004
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,720
got to call into the show last week and kind of say their piece, however, we do have some

1005
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,720
emails.

1006
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,720
I want to start with this.

1007
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,720
This is from Dark Mutts.

1008
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:28,240
Hey guys and gal, I have been listening to you for about six months and I found your

1009
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,160
podcast to be the only one that is consistent and always entertaining.

1010
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,160
Thank you.

1011
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,400
I have to thank Loki because without his clever insight about what makes a game fun, I never

1012
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,760
would have found Earth Defense Force 2017.

1013
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,040
I have been addicted since I acquired it.

1014
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,840
Congrats on five years and keep it coming.

1015
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,880
The three of you keep me going through my work day without having to light anyone on

1016
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,880
fire.

1017
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,840
Thanks again, Dark Mutts.

1018
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,840
Very cool.

1019
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,400
Isn't that a weird feeling when somebody says like, because video games aren't cheap, so

1020
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,840
like somebody says like based on your word, I spent $50 of my hard-earned money for my

1021
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,640
day job that drives me insane to buy this game.

1022
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,360
At least it's only a $40 game so that doesn't, you know, it knows like still, but still,

1023
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360
I know, I know.

1024
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,880
So what makes a game fun for you, Loki?

1025
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,480
It's just, it's got to be fun.

1026
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,840
I mean, you know, Earth Defense Force is one of those games, I'm still playing it.

1027
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,520
It's because, you know, you know what you're getting into when you play it.

1028
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,860
It's cheesy and weird, but you can really ramp up the difficulty in it and it gives

1029
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:30,720
you something to kind of achieve for, you know, collecting the different weapons used

1030
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,520
in the game and trying to beat each level, you know, on different difficulties.

1031
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,240
It's a lot of teamwork involved.

1032
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,240
I don't know.

1033
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,840
It's just, it's hard to really pinpoint what makes a game great, but you know, Time

1034
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:47,280
Splitters 2 was another one or even Time Splitters 3 had really a lot of, you know, stuff to

1035
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
do in it.

1036
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,280
You can play the story modes.

1037
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,800
They have a bunch of like mini games to try out and the mini games get pretty hard.

1038
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,680
Like they have, I remember the original Time Splitters, you have to break windows with

1039
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,320
bricks and that sounds easy, but you have a time limit and you have to do that and it

1040
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,840
gets pretty hard.

1041
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,400
So I don't know.

1042
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,220
It's a cool game.

1043
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,920
Lots of blah, blah, blahs in chat right now.

1044
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,920
Let me read some of these.

1045
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,360
Solid Goomba says, I bought Earth Defense Force after hearing Loki rave about it.

1046
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,360
So that's another person.

1047
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,480
Boy, that company should be sending you a check.

1048
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,480
Hey, D3's awesome.

1049
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,480
I've been playing, what is it, Work Time Fun right now and that game is so stupid and

1050
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,040
awful but I can't stop playing it.

1051
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,040
I don't know why.

1052
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,320
JV Mon says, Loki is the king of OLR and Rob is his puppet.

1053
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,320
There you go.

1054
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,660
RosteelUT, who I've been quoting a lot tonight, I guess I like the cynics tonight because

1055
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,220
RosteelUT is kind of our in-house cynic, says, Loki, very fucking insightful.

1056
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,220
What makes a game fun?

1057
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,440
Um, the game's fun?

1058
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,840
I don't know what makes it fun.

1059
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,840
Ew, what a cunty bitch, man.

1060
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,760
That's what he says to everyone apparently.

1061
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,580
It's basically lots of stuff to do in the game, like a lot of options for you.

1062
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,580
It's whatever you enjoy.

1063
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,580
It's the game play.

1064
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,020
You like blowing shit up.

1065
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,280
I like blowing stuff up.

1066
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,480
I like writing boobs in places I shouldn't be able to and naming things.

1067
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,320
Everybody finds something different to be fun usually, right?

1068
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,760
It doesn't matter what I find fun.

1069
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,840
It's whatever you find fun.

1070
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,240
If you don't want to trust my judgment with buying a game, you can always go rent it.

1071
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,720
That's a lot cheaper and I'm sure a lot of the mom and pop shops out there would really

1072
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,840
appreciate that from you.

1073
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:24,000
Dark Tetsuya says, tonight's OLR has been brought to you by D3 and by GameTap.

1074
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,680
I neglected to say I played GameTap during my gaming week because I just needed to leave

1075
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,960
it out for once, all right, because I knew there was going to be that fucking comment

1076
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,960
at some point.

1077
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,920
I'm not on D3 payroll, that's for sure, but at least they have the balls to bring over

1078
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,120
games that might not necessarily work over here, like Earth Defense Force and they have

1079
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,260
that one that's coming out at one point, the 360 where you're like some chick in lingerie

1080
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,760
with a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword.

1081
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,680
That might not necessarily do well over here, but at least they're going to give it a shot.

1082
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,960
What the fuck are you talking about?

1083
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,960
That sounds awesome.

1084
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,160
That's the name of the game.

1085
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,160
I don't remember what it's called.

1086
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,320
It's got some long Japanese name and I'm not even going to attempt to remember what it

1087
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,600
was.

1088
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,120
Act Deaf says Pac-Man Championship Edition is fun, yet Loki doesn't see that.

1089
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,040
I think Pac-Man Championship Edition is a hell of a lot of fun.

1090
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,760
It's way more fast paced than the old one, which I think is awesome, the Ray-Far music

1091
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,760
and everything.

1092
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,480
I'm just not a fan of Pac-Man that much.

1093
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,360
I love the really, really retro classics and updates and that stuff, like the old school

1094
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,360
arcade game.

1095
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,760
It's just like I'm playing Zelda II now for some reason and I don't know why.

1096
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,760
Zelda II?

1097
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,760
Yeah.

1098
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,760
It's like a great game.

1099
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,760
Not really.

1100
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,760
Yes, it is.

1101
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,760
It's like a great game.

1102
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,760
I like it too.

1103
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
I think it's great.

1104
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,760
I think I need to buy that on the Wii.

1105
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,760
You totally do.

1106
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,760
Anyway, what else was I going to say?

1107
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,040
Any other fun factor games that people are overlooking right now?

1108
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,440
I think about Katamari Damacy.

1109
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,720
What sold that game?

1110
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,400
The fun factor and the fact that it was a low price.

1111
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,360
The game itself wasn't exactly graphically the most impressive.

1112
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,960
You would ask people what draws you to Katamari Damacy and people just go, it's fucking fun

1113
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
to roll over shit.

1114
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,760
Then, of course, you have your cynics who just want everybody to say, that game sucks.

1115
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,160
You know they're welcome to that opinion.

1116
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,200
I would recommend it and this would be pretty hard to find nowadays, but if you can, find

1117
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,200
it.

1118
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,280
I don't recommend buying it, but if you can rent it, Driver 3.

1119
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,200
I know, I know, it's such a horrible game, but it's really a game that you need to play

1120
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,300
because you're just like, oh my God, I can't believe it's really this bad.

1121
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,020
It's entertaining in that aspect.

1122
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,680
My sister is buying my Playstation 2 and we have that game dumped on the hard drive so

1123
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,040
she can play it and I swear to God, she plays this thing more than anything else on that

1124
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,040
damn system.

1125
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,960
They will sit there for hours recording instant replays and watching the AI get all fucked

1126
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,960
up.

1127
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,200
Driver 3 is the show girls of gaming.

1128
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,920
It's so bad, it's pretty good.

1129
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,840
There's a lot of games out there that are really hard to, a lot of people overlook that

1130
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,840
are fun.

1131
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,200
You just really have to play a lot of the stuff.

1132
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,040
Saints Row is another one that I love.

1133
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,040
New email.

1134
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,680
Oh man, Saints Row, the musical, that was so funny.

1135
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,040
Only three emails tonight.

1136
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,880
Here's the second one and this is from the doctor and says, alright, this is my first

1137
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,880
email to the mailbag.

1138
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,880
I'm so nervous.

1139
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,840
Okay, first question is for DarkSakura.

1140
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:21,880
How many Pokemon do you own in your game because I own 354 because I have no life whatsoever

1141
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,920
now that school is over for me and could we possibly battle sometime?

1142
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,840
Unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here, she can't answer your question.

1143
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,440
Maybe she'll read up your email earlier.

1144
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,160
I don't think she's super duper far into the game, so she probably has less than 50, but

1145
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,160
that's speculation.

1146
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,160
I don't know for sure.

1147
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,360
But if you want to battle with DarkSakura, urge her to leave her friend code in our forums

1148
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,960
because we actually have a forum post for Pokemon friend codes.

1149
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,800
Moving on back to the doctor's email.

1150
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
Second is for Skye.

1151
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,800
I heart you.

1152
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,840
Aw, thank you.

1153
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,640
And could you say, excuse me DarkSakura, again, please, please, please.

1154
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,280
I'll see what I can do.

1155
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Third is for Loki.

1156
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,680
Okay, I got nothing, sorry, oh wait.

1157
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,900
How good were you at DDR before you stopped?

1158
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,740
Because I go to the golf and stuff nearest me and play Supernova when I get some extra

1159
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,380
money to spend and how the fuck do you manage crossovers?

1160
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,160
They piss me off.

1161
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:20,760
I used to play a lot of doubles actually at one time and I used to do a lot of the Katas

1162
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,080
because I could never pass max or anything like that on doubles.

1163
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,600
It's just too fast.

1164
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,620
You get to the point there, especially when you're running back and forth on some of those

1165
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:35,720
doubles things, if there's any amount of dust on there, you're going to fall on your ass.

1166
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,960
Really I'd never try to do that stuff, but I did play some really hard edits.

1167
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,640
I used to do edits a lot and really they can be as hard as you want to make them, I guess.

1168
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,320
There was, oh my God, and I don't remember the guy.

1169
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:53,880
There's this one Japanese guy that had a website with edits on there and they were the fucking

1170
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,880
shit.

1171
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,200
I don't remember who the guy is now because I haven't been playing edits for a long time,

1172
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,760
but I don't know.

1173
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:06,880
If you look for some DDR edit websites, this guy is just amazing and he had a bunch of

1174
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,920
Ask URS sites, so I wish I could be more helpful there, but some great stuff.

1175
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:20,840
They had one for, it was called Swingman, that was on the Jazz and it was an awesome

1176
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,840
edit.

1177
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,600
It had this real flow to it that was really cool.

1178
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:30,560
One last question from the doctor, when did Squaresoft become Square Enix and why?

1179
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,920
Or as we call them here on the show, Squeenix.

1180
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,940
When did Square Enix become and why?

1181
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,080
It was what, about three years ago?

1182
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,160
Two or three years ago.

1183
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,000
They bought Enix, which had made a bunch of games, Dragon Quest is probably their most

1184
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,200
popular series of games, which you may know as Dragon Warrior, years ago it was called.

1185
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,600
What else did they make?

1186
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:56,280
I know on Super Nintendo they were very popular for Brain Lord and Illusion of Gaia and those

1187
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,280
games.

1188
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,700
Then later on, I also know for music game fans, they were the folks that made Bust A

1189
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,700
Move.

1190
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,440
Did they do the Tow Ball series or was that Square?

1191
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,920
I don't know off the top of my head.

1192
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,720
I'm sure someone in the chat knows.

1193
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,720
So there you go.

1194
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:14,820
Yeah, that's what happened, that was a few years ago and a lot of people were very afraid

1195
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,520
when that merge first happened, but it actually hasn't been too bad.

1196
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,800
In fact, a lot of good stuff has come out of that company, it's hard to complain.

1197
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,960
So there you go.

1198
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,280
And just for you, the doctor, I dug this up for you.

1199
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,760
Well excuse me, Dark Sakura.

1200
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,880
Now don't tell her I played that or I'm going to fucking get beat up when she comes back.

1201
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,200
I don't think she was too happy with that.

1202
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,200
Why?

1203
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,360
I know, I think it's funny.

1204
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,360
It's brilliant.

1205
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,720
I think it's because I called her Dark Sakura and she doesn't like that.

1206
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,680
Well excuse me.

1207
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,360
Then there was another one, remember the Rob D made these, he made another one.

1208
00:56:53,360 --> 00:57:00,720
Well excuse me again, Dark Sakura.

1209
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,400
I'm so going to get beat up.

1210
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,880
Love you Jamie, wherever you are.

1211
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,000
Anyhow, one more email.

1212
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,440
And this one wasn't signed, so I don't really know who to say who this is from.

1213
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,080
I don't even know if I want to read the, it's Ikuma is in the header, so we'll just say

1214
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,080
it's from them.

1215
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,720
It says, hi there.

1216
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,440
I have been listening for one and a half year and just want to take this opportunity to

1217
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,040
wish you guys happy fifth.

1218
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,560
I am a developer in Japan and yes, Rob had once mentioned our game in the new release

1219
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,560
section.

1220
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,120
We all just love it when Rob reads in Japanese.

1221
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,040
And then there's a cute little face there.

1222
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,960
And who says no love from developer?

1223
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,040
Hope you guys would be part of my Friday for another five years to come.

1224
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,280
So unfortunately this person didn't say who they are, what developer they're talking about

1225
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,600
or any of that stuff, just that.

1226
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,320
I have horribly butchered the name of one of their games on the program in the past.

1227
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,320
That's love though.

1228
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,320
That's awesome.

1229
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,320
That's awesome.

1230
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,320
That's awesome.

1231
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,520
Thank you so much for the email.

1232
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,640
Tell us who you are because we'd love to have more developers on the show, especially ones

1233
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,520
that are crazy enough to listen to this.

1234
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,760
We'd also love to be invited to Tokyo Game Show.

1235
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,640
That's a very good point.

1236
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:13,040
If you would like some coverage of Tokyo Game Show from us, please email us and let us know.

1237
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,040
That's awesome.

1238
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,240
Dark Tetsuya asks, was it the developer of Dust Cap Extreme 2 Collector's Edition?

1239
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,360
Probably one of your hamster love games or something.

1240
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,360
God, I hope so.

1241
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,360
God, I hope so.

1242
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,360
Oh my God.

1243
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,360
Oh my God.

1244
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,400
Please tell me you guys develop one of those hamster games.

1245
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,120
There's another one of those hamster games coming out over here.

1246
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,120
There's a couple of hamster games coming out over here.

1247
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,080
I think Hamster Life 2 is coming out over here now.

1248
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,560
Those Ubisoft games.

1249
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,980
All right.

1250
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,980
That was the last email.

1251
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,980
I'm going to close up the old mailbag.

1252
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,520
That comes with a we because I would totally buy that game.

1253
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,800
God, that made me so happy when I read that email.

1254
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,800
I was like, oh good.

1255
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,880
They're not getting all pissed off that I'm butchering their releases.

1256
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,880
Funny American.

1257
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,160
It's stupid, Matt.

1258
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,160
All right.

1259
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,160
Back to the gaming news.

1260
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,600
If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelauncherdo.com.

1261
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:05,360
If you're from an American, Canadian, Antarctican developer, who cares?

1262
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,240
Email us and tell us you're listening because we love to hear that folks in the industry

1263
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,240
are listening.

1264
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,640
Dude, totally need to meet up at the arcade in Antarctica to play some DDR.

1265
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,960
Shut up and get to the next story.

1266
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:23,960
Anyways, Civilization is coming to consoles and handhelds soon being brought over by 2K

1267
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:29,160
Games and developed by Fireaxis Games, Civilization Revolution.

1268
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:35,240
It's going to include 16 civilizations to master and lead to victory and of course famous

1269
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,680
historical leaders, yada, yada, yada.

1270
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:43,400
Online multiplayer as well is going to be in it.

1271
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,400
Pretty cool.

1272
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,520
I'm not a huge Civilization fan, but it sounds interesting.

1273
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,160
I'm a fucking huge Civilization fan, at least the old school ones, and I don't know how

1274
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,160
to approach this.

1275
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,160
I'm a little worried.

1276
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,680
Well, okay, first off, this is not the first time we've had Civilization on a console.

1277
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,880
The original Civilization was on Super Nintendo and there was a version of Civilization II

1278
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,360
I played on the N-Gage of all things, the E3 a couple years ago, and it made me want

1279
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:11,680
to cry and stab myself with the blunt N-Gage.

1280
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,680
These are what?

1281
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,520
Spin-off games or are these direct ports?

1282
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,980
I think this is a spin-off series.

1283
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:20,520
When I read it, it sounded like a spin-off series, which can go who knows any which way.

1284
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,200
God, then that makes me worry, is this going to turn out like the Mortal Kombat anthology

1285
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,200
stories or whatever?

1286
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,520
Remember the Sub-Zero game?

1287
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,640
I don't think it's anything like that, but I hope not.

1288
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,360
It's probably going to be maybe a little bit more scaled down for consoles.

1289
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,400
I don't know.

1290
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,400
It sounds okay.

1291
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,920
Well, do you really need to scale down for consoles?

1292
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,740
I just could not see the full game itself on an Xbox 360, and the biggest reason why

1293
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,480
is that there's no mouse and those thumb sticks don't cut it.

1294
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,040
Some games were meant to be played with a mouse, and that's all there is to it.

1295
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,720
I don't understand why they just don't have keyboard and mouse support, since it has fucking

1296
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,720
USB ports.

1297
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:09,620
In fact, all of the next-gen platforms have USB ports that can put a keyboard and mouse

1298
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:10,620
on there.

1299
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,760
Except for maybe the Wii, that'd be kind of stupid because you have the Wii Remote,

1300
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,400
but still though, if you really want to and if they really would decide to support it,

1301
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,440
they could put a keyboard and mouse on there.

1302
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,600
Another very popular PC gaming series is Guild Wars, and IGN had an interview this week on

1303
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,460
their PC site about Guild Wars 2 and the Eye of the North expansion for Guild Wars.

1304
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,160
You played Guild Wars for a little bit, right?

1305
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,160
I totally did.

1306
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,160
And what'd you think?

1307
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,520
I actually liked it until it got to level 20, and then it was just like, oh.

1308
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,760
Well maybe there's something in the Eye of the North for you, because Eye of the North,

1309
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,360
I was kind of reading through the interview here, and if you want to read the full thing,

1310
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,500
head over to PC.IGN.com and you can read the full thing.

1311
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,720
What I didn't know, because I didn't know a lot about these games before I was reading

1312
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,600
the interview, and Eye of the North is actually the first Guild Wars expansion that requires

1313
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,080
one of the other expansions to play.

1314
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,600
And the reason for that is that all of the content they put into this, they put 18 new

1315
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,200
dungeons and they're all for endgame characters.

1316
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,880
So whereas with any of the other expansions, you can buy them by themselves and create

1317
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,120
a character from the ground up.

1318
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:18,920
But for this one, they didn't waste any time making a level one through 20 story.

1319
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:24,480
It's all hardcore endgame content, which I think is kind of interesting about that.

1320
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,840
And then I kind of went to talking about how they're actually developing the game, and

1321
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,000
did they actually split into two different development teams?

1322
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,200
And yes, there's a development team for Guild Wars 2 right now, but then the Eye of the

1323
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,320
North people will come over when Guild Wars 2 is done.

1324
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:44,320
And they admit that most of the resources are being focused on the Guild Wars expansion,

1325
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,700
but then they're going to all shift over to Guild Wars 2 once the expansion is done.

1326
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,720
So this definitely sounds like it's going to be the last Guild Wars expansion.

1327
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,120
And they actually say that they do kind of tend to monitor the trends in the PVP, like

1328
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:02,240
meta games that people come up with, and then they kind of like figure out, use those ideas

1329
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,200
for like live events and holiday events.

1330
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,440
And then they claim them for themselves, they're like, that was my idea!

1331
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,440
Wait a minute!

1332
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,440
No, they just sound like they're really tied down to the community, which I think is great.

1333
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,920
So there you go, some exciting news for Guild Wars fans.

1334
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,920
Awesome.

1335
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:28,760
Anyways, so we've got some interesting stuff, I guess, making its way out to the US.

1336
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:36,120
Not a whole lot though, this week's kind of dead, as most of July usually is.

1337
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,480
Pretty much this week though, the only things you've got are Ninja Game Sigma for Playstation

1338
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:47,020
3, and Vampire Rain on the Xbox 360.

1339
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,120
That is about it.

1340
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:55,080
PC games, there's a bunch of weird stuff coming out, including, let's see, well actually Marvel

1341
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:02,920
Trading Card games coming out on PC, Title Legends 2 is coming out on PC, Ride!

1342
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,520
Carnival Tycoon, I swear to God, every fucking week there's a goddamn Tycoon game coming

1343
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,920
out.

1344
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:18,160
DS, Platinum Sudoku, and Vegas Casino High Five, making its way out.

1345
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,040
So that is it.

1346
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,720
Alright, let's head on over to the Japanese release dates and check out what's going on

1347
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,340
in Japan.

1348
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,280
Is Chicken Shoot coming out this week?

1349
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,880
Chicken Shoot came out last week too.

1350
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,000
Oh my God, did it really?

1351
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I guess.

1352
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
No, Chicken Shoot's great.

1353
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,520
Sorry, because it was on the list over here, but as a US release, so I just wanted to kind

1354
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,520
of question that.

1355
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,900
It doesn't look like there's actually a whole lot coming out in Japan as well, though there

1356
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:45,160
are a couple games coming out on the Playstation 3, Blazing Angels, Squadrons of World War

1357
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:50,280
2 for the Playstation 3, Boku no Natsu Yasu-oh God, I just butchered that one.

1358
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,680
Boku no Natsu Yasumi 3 is coming out over in Japan as well, and that was like a bug

1359
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,680
catching game.

1360
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,400
Wait, I didn't hear that Rob, can you say that again?

1361
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,960
Boku no Natsu Yasumi 3 is coming out.

1362
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,480
See the more I practice, the better I get.

1363
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,000
It's a bug catching game.

1364
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,640
Why don't we get anything like that over here?

1365
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,320
Doesn't that look cute?

1366
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,640
Maybe that's what Africa is going to actually be all about.

1367
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,640
Africa?

1368
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,640
Poaching animals?

1369
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,640
Yes, you poach animals.

1370
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,800
That would be fun.

1371
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,520
I'm assuming that because I see the little guy on the cover of the game is holding a

1372
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,200
little bug net and little like, you know, thing that you keep bugs in.

1373
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,660
Anyway, let's see if there's anything else coming out on some of the other platforms

1374
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,160
that you might be looking forward to.

1375
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,160
What?

1376
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,640
It's really crazy kid with bug net murders family.

1377
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,780
PlayStation 2, some stuff really just moving into the best hits like Winning Post 7, Ape

1378
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:46,720
Escape 3, and Ratchet and Clank 4 is all moving into the best.

1379
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,320
Not a lot of new stuff coming out otherwise, but some price reductions there.

1380
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,080
Coming out on the Nintendo DS though, you have some stuff coming out.

1381
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,280
Chibi-Robo Park Patrol is coming out.

1382
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:05,760
Yoku Demo Yoga coming out on the DS, and let's see what else we have here, Kururin Donuts

1383
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,040
Okashi Recipe.

1384
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:13,560
I have no idea what that is, but it's got a happy donut on the cover and it's an action

1385
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,960
game, so it kind of makes it look like it might be a racing game involving donuts.

1386
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:17,960
I have no fucking idea.

1387
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,200
Happy donut action game.

1388
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,680
Yeah, but who wouldn't want to buy a happy donut action game?

1389
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,680
I don't know.

1390
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,120
I'd buy a happy donut action game.

1391
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,120
Me too.

1392
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,120
Poochie Poochie Virus.

1393
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:31,520
It sounds fascinating and is also coming out on the DS.

1394
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:37,280
It's also another action game with a cast of very chibi looking characters there also

1395
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,760
coming to Japan.

1396
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:45,680
Quickly looking to see if there's anything on the PSP this week in Japan.

1397
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:50,840
Just like just some games going into the best hits, including Rengoku 2, The Stairway to

1398
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,280
Heaven moving into the best hits.

1399
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,680
Or Hell, depending on how you look at it.

1400
01:06:54,680 --> 01:07:00,880
All right, going over to the European release dates, Dark Sakura, sadly not here this week,

1401
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:06,080
but on July 6th, those of you over in Europe can look forward to The King of Fighters,

1402
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,340
Maximum Impact 2, and The King of Fighters 11 on the PlayStation 2, as well as the Metal

1403
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:14,160
Slug Anthology coming out on the PlayStation 2.

1404
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,160
That's really it.

1405
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,800
It's a very slow week for those of you guys in Europe.

1406
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,280
All right, that does it for release dates.

1407
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:29,920
Well, it may be a little too soon, but the VTech report covering what happened with the

1408
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:36,760
shootings at Virginia Tech, apparently there's no mention of the video game issue, despite

1409
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:44,000
the fact that everybody was saying, hey, video games made him kill people, dah, dah, dah.

1410
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
That's interesting, but apparently the PAC though, they've denounced the report saying

1411
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,160
that it's a cover-up, and they're claiming that really it was video games to blame, and

1412
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,480
it's this giant cover-up.

1413
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,480
Oh, shut up.

1414
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,760
Seriously.

1415
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,760
Shut the hell up, people.

1416
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,280
Why do people want to blame video games for everything?

1417
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,280
I don't know.

1418
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:14,680
It's just people want to focus on whatever their agenda is, and if they really want to

1419
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:19,440
get rid of video games, or censor them to death, just like they did with rap music and

1420
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:24,240
stuff before, they're going to make any excuses, oh, it's going to make you infertile if you

1421
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:28,400
play video games, oh, it's kill my baby, stuff like that.

1422
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,880
So pretty soon they'll be just like, oh, if you don't have Jesus in your life, you're

1423
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,520
going to go kill people.

1424
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,600
It's crazy shit.

1425
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:43,400
Chat room, chat.orangehonestready.com, live on Sunday nights, Solid Goomba says, didn't

1426
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,720
they search his room and not even find a single console?

1427
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,600
I seem to remember that to be the case.

1428
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,600
Exactly, just because he participates in a goddamn extracurricular activity, which includes

1429
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:58,400
playing a computer game, oh my God, that doesn't mean that he's trained on that computer game

1430
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,760
to be a killer, and I'm sorry, but there is no way on the face of the earth to train on

1431
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,500
a PC game to become a killer.

1432
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:13,260
I think for some sad whatever reason, people have the need to blame something, and obviously

1433
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:19,560
what happened at Virginia Tech was just absolutely tremendously horrible, and a lot of us had

1434
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,960
that reaction of how could something like this happen?

1435
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,360
How fucked up is this world that some kid would do this to their peers?

1436
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,180
So I think out of that desperation, people look for something to blame, and video games

1437
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:38,320
unfortunately are an easy target because they allow you to pretend that you are someone

1438
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,380
else, and unfortunately not everybody can see that line.

1439
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,720
I don't even know why this was an issue when they didn't even have any sort of evidence

1440
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:48,160
in the beginning that video games were even involved in any way, but immediately they're

1441
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:54,480
saying, oh, it must be this, it's Doom, it's Marilyn Manson, it's MTV, it's all this that

1442
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,800
did this.

1443
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,080
Take responsibility, people.

1444
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:05,000
It was a crazy, crazy, crazy person that probably, I don't know, I don't even want to speculate

1445
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,200
because I'll say something that will be foot and mouth syndrome, but it was a very unfortunate

1446
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,960
thing, period.

1447
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,640
I blame World War II.

1448
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,640
That's what I blame.

1449
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,920
It's all those World War II documentaries out there that show the kamikazes.

1450
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,920
That's what I blame.

1451
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,840
I blame the Atari 2600, don't you?

1452
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,840
I do.

1453
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,120
I mean, they had the man bomber after all in there.

1454
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:35,600
Well, the Atari 2600 is getting the flashback portable, at least it's a little prototype

1455
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,120
that's been made.

1456
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,720
Kurt Vendell, who actually made the original Atari flashback, is now trying to make an

1457
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,840
Atari flashback portable, and the thing's tiny.

1458
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,240
I mean, it's almost the size of the old Atari cartridge.

1459
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:51,160
So if you've ever wanted to play your favorite 2600 games on the go, that could actually

1460
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,120
be on the way.

1461
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,960
The unit is supposed to run off three AAA batteries with a 15-hour run time, I mean,

1462
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:03,000
it is an Atari 2600 after all, and there's going to be a USB port on it, so that way

1463
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,880
you can actually load games from the USB.

1464
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,200
So I don't know if it's going to actually support ROMs or if you're going to buy games

1465
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:14,160
a la iTunes or what the deal is, because it's really easy to get free Atari games online

1466
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,160
at this point.

1467
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:20,320
I swear to God, the entire collection of Atari games, everything ever made, is six megs.

1468
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,700
So you could easily fit that on a USB card.

1469
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,700
Very tiny.

1470
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:29,440
But what I would like to see that used for is maybe some homebrew, because even the Atari

1471
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,120
2600 still has some homebrew love, a lot of homebrew love for it, so you never know what

1472
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,120
might happen.

1473
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,640
I don't know if I would necessarily buy this, though, but I don't know, maybe.

1474
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:42,220
Depends, if it was like 20 bucks or something, it would be worth it.

1475
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:45,720
Games were so simple back then, and sometimes that's kind of like, you know, like I was

1476
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:51,680
saying last week, I found myself playing Pitfall for God knows what reason for quite a chunk

1477
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,540
of time last Saturday.

1478
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:59,920
Can you imagine, if you will, if they were to bring combat to Xbox Live Arcade and have

1479
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,240
like leaderboards for that shit?

1480
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,240
That'd be fucking awesome.

1481
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,640
Aren't they going to bring some old Atari classics?

1482
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,840
I seem to remember Warlords was coming to Xbox Live.

1483
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,840
That's an old school Atari game.

1484
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,320
And of course, we have Centipede and Millipede.

1485
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,320
I want combat with no graphical upgrades whatsoever.

1486
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,840
I just want the whole thing to be done like that and have like leaderboards.

1487
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,160
What if they did the classic graphics slash upgrade graphics?

1488
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,680
I guess, if they really want to do that, but I'd be fine with just the classic graphics,

1489
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:29,520
because I think that'd be funny, and just have like a leaderboard thing where you know,

1490
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,520
win matches and stuff.

1491
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,560
I did not realize you were such an Atari 2600 fan.

1492
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,400
Oh, I used to play the Atari 2600 all the time.

1493
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,400
I'm a huge combat fan.

1494
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,960
Oh, keep that in mind for later on.

1495
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,480
We're going to see what happens later on.

1496
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:44,160
So, I'm going to tease something coming up in Part B. That's all I have to say.

1497
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,160
Alright, moving on.

1498
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:53,880
Anyways, apparently the ESRB is cracking down on violent game trailers now.

1499
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,840
Nothing really new, but of course, especially after the whole fiasco with Manhunt 2, they're

1500
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,800
kind of, I guess, taking notice on some of the trailers that have been released out there,

1501
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:10,400
including Gears of War, which was available online since January, is now, of course, coming

1502
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:21,760
down and apparently Darkness and Dark Sector videos have been immediately, I guess, pulled

1503
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,520
because I guess they were too bloody or whatever and I guess were an adult only thing.

1504
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:32,640
They should have such things as a red band trailer for games, I think, but I don't know.

1505
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,440
I think it's kind of stupid though since before they were rating them with, oh, because they're

1506
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,560
interactive and stuff, we've got to rate them a little harsher, which is dumb anyways, but

1507
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,200
you're watching a video game play.

1508
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:47,560
You don't have any sort of interaction with it.

1509
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,400
I think game trailers are still pretty safe.

1510
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,400
I don't understand why.

1511
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,960
I didn't even know they rated trailers.

1512
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,480
I know that a lot of times they'll say, you know, this product is not yet rated or something

1513
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,480
like that.

1514
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:01,720
The trailers themselves, yeah, red band trailers, very rare and hard to find.

1515
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:05,480
You don't see them a lot in theaters ever, but you see them on home movies sometimes,

1516
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,120
especially from the indie companies.

1517
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:12,120
You sometimes see a red band trailer where the preview is for restricted audiences only

1518
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:17,800
and that's because they'll have a gunshot in it or a real quick bloodshot or maybe some

1519
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,800
booby.

1520
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,160
It might be an ad for a sexy movie and you see a lady wearing a dress that's see-through

1521
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,160
or something.

1522
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,320
You see red band trailers once in a while.

1523
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,400
I think it's kind of ridiculous though that they're policing game trailers because that's

1524
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,960
not even, you know, it's not the actual game.

1525
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,880
It's like kind of a video of it or it's maybe like, you know, I know that they do that with

1526
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:43,360
movie trailers, you know, that they rate that this trailer isn't good for all audiences

1527
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,240
and stuff, but I think it's kind of ridiculous to do that with games.

1528
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:51,800
I could've sworn I heard some point that yellow bands were coming for the PG-13 and up audiences

1529
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,800
only.

1530
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,800
I can't remember.

1531
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,600
Maybe it was PG-13 audiences only.

1532
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,420
We're going to have yellow band trailers, but I don't know if that ever, I might just

1533
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:04,040
be pulling that out of my butt, but I seem to remember reading that somewhere, I don't

1534
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,040
know.

1535
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,400
Well, obviously this next topic is rated G. This is definitely for everybody.

1536
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:16,920
This cat, wait, hold on, DarkDockra is not here this week, but so we can't do a website

1537
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,480
of the week, but if she could, and she was here this week, I'm pretty sure this would

1538
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,200
have been a top contender for her website of the week.

1539
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,360
Okay, yes, Loki, you can do your outburst now.

1540
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,160
Sorry, this cat right here made me get a cat.

1541
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,160
Really?

1542
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,160
Why is that?

1543
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,080
Because it's super cute and I want a gaming cat.

1544
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:36,200
All right, well, yes, this is the Famiko blog and you can visit this blog if you'd like

1545
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,200
to it.

1546
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:45,840
I love fami.blog90.fc2.com and this is just a cat that poses with it, they make poses

1547
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,200
of it playing the DS and the 360.

1548
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,200
Did you ever see the other?

1549
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,200
It's so cute.

1550
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,840
Yeah, see, I mean, look at that one up, one more, one more up.

1551
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,840
It was that one.

1552
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,840
Is that one going down?

1553
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,080
Yeah, keep going.

1554
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,400
The one that's playing the DS.

1555
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,000
The cat is very cute.

1556
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,720
It's basically, it's like a oolong, but a kitty.

1557
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:09,680
This site reminds me a lot of oolong, which was the bunny with pancakes on its head.

1558
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:14,720
Have you ever seen the macro that says, this thread has gotten boring, so here's a bunny

1559
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,160
with pancakes on its head.

1560
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,840
That was oolong, the famous bunny that would, this blog reminds me of that, except it's

1561
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,120
a cat and the cat sometimes plays video games, but not always.

1562
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,120
This is so cute.

1563
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Go up, go up, go up.

1564
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,120
Keep going.

1565
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,120
That's the picture right there.

1566
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:32,000
That is a very cute cat.

1567
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,320
And I believe the cat's name is Famicom, right?

1568
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,320
It's Fami.

1569
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,700
Or Fami, named after the Famicom.

1570
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,700
Very cute.

1571
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,700
Named after famine.

1572
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:44,360
Are you wanting to, you're so messed up.

1573
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,800
Are you wanting to get a kitty someday, Rice Princess?

1574
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,800
No.

1575
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,800
Oh, okay.

1576
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,320
I just wanted you to contribute something to this show.

1577
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:55,280
I am going to attempt to get the cat that we're getting to sit there and oppose that

1578
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,200
look like it's playing the DS.

1579
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,600
I don't think it's going to work, but we're going to try it.

1580
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:04,120
You know what you need to do is get the cat to pose reading porn.

1581
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,120
That would be funny.

1582
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,120
Get a picture of that.

1583
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,080
I don't have any porn, at least not in magazine form.

1584
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,080
How can you not have porn?

1585
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,080
I'll get my laptop.

1586
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:16,680
I will buy you a freaking Playboy or something and you can pose the cat with porn.

1587
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,920
Porn and like have it drinking alcohol and...

1588
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:24,880
Yes, you should be Stella the porno cat.

1589
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,040
You should get a little pimp hat.

1590
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:30,640
Oh boy, I think our phone line is already ringing with calls from PETA.

1591
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,840
So we better take a break and we're going to take a quick break here and we'll be back

1592
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,160
with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
