00:00.000 --> 00:24.040
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening.

00:24.040 --> 00:28.080
We are here for this Part B of our show and we're going to get right back into the gaming

00:28.080 --> 00:29.080
news.

00:29.080 --> 00:35.320
Just a reminder, we won't be here next week because we are relocating to a new place,

00:35.320 --> 00:40.680
which is code word for I'm moving, and Dark Soccer is going to Disneyland, and Loki's

00:40.680 --> 00:43.600
just taking a night off because he gets one.

00:43.600 --> 00:48.400
If the studio doesn't have good ventilation, I'm buying a wall unit.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
I'm not even joking.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.880
I will have to fight the cats in the deck.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.800
Or then we'll move it to your house.

00:52.800 --> 00:58.360
No, because the room that the computer is in also has poor ventilation and a bunch of

00:58.360 --> 00:59.360
stuff in it.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.360
Stuff.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.360
We got a laser pointer for the cat.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.040
You got a laser pointer for the cat?

01:05.040 --> 01:06.640
Or to point at the cat?

01:06.640 --> 01:07.640
To point at the cat.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.680
Oh, I thought maybe you were going to strap a laser pointer onto the cat's head.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.680
They have those.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.760
So you can get a cat with a freaking laser on it.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.760
That's dangerous.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.440
You get a cat with a freaking laser on it and say, alright, come on, let's get back

01:17.440 --> 01:18.680
to the gaming news.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.880
Somebody, quick, start us off.

01:20.880 --> 01:21.880
Anyways.

01:21.880 --> 01:22.880
Pac-Man.

01:22.880 --> 01:23.880
No Pac-Man.

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
Aww.

01:24.880 --> 01:29.680
So, yeah, it's kind of interesting with the whole announcement with the Wii Fit board.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.440
We kind of talked about this a little bit last week.

01:32.440 --> 01:39.320
Possible other usage for the board, actually, like in, say, a snowboarding game or skateboarding

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
or whatnot.

01:40.320 --> 01:44.580
But one company that's looking at possibly doing something with it is actually Square

01:44.580 --> 01:45.580
Enix.

01:45.580 --> 01:49.840
And they kind of were saying, they were intrigued by the idea of using weight and balance to

01:49.840 --> 01:52.100
control games.

01:52.100 --> 01:57.140
So possibly, you know, using that in an upcoming RPG.

01:57.140 --> 01:58.560
So that's kind of interesting.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.000
How exactly would you use weight and balance in an RPG?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I have no idea.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.680
Maybe the longer you stand on one foot, the more health you have.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
No.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.920
As soon as you fall, oh, zero.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.200
Maybe dodging or something.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.200
I don't know.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.120
I don't see anything like that.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.200
I think it would be good for just like sports games.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.440
Like the next, you know, SSX game or whatever.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.280
Just have that as an optional control method.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.920
Or what we all need, a jump hoping game.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.500
Oh, God.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.280
That one game they have at Dave and Buster's.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.600
That horrible game with the music.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.600
That's what they need.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.600
That jumping rope.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.600
I can't remember what the name of it is.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.240
I'm sure somebody in the chat will yell it out that was there.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.240
I want to play.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.240
What are you talking about?

02:38.240 --> 02:39.240
It's funny.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.240
I don't know.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.240
It's not at our Dave and Buster's, is it?

02:41.240 --> 02:42.240
Thank you.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.240
SSJ100Matt says jump in jackpot.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.240
That's what it's called.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.080
I want to play something where you jump around to music.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.800
I've never done that before.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.760
It's totally by the people that do Flame and Finger.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.760
Oh, then it has to be good.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.760
It's the same soundtrack?

02:53.760 --> 02:54.760
It's similar.

02:54.760 --> 02:55.760
Similar stuff.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.760
Oh, my God.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.760
I love Flame and Finger's soundtrack.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.760
It's so good.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.560
Well, anyway, hold on.

03:00.560 --> 03:05.120
Jump in jackpot is not a role-playing game, so I'm trying to figure out how this could

03:05.120 --> 03:06.480
tie into a role-playing game.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.580
It just doesn't make sense.

03:08.580 --> 03:12.360
Could be for your character walking around, I would assume.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.240
But I don't want to stand when I play a game like Final Fantasy.

03:15.240 --> 03:19.080
Final Fantasy is a game for me to sit on my big butt on the couch and play.

03:19.080 --> 03:23.360
Maybe you could sit on the Wii Fit board and lean back and forth.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.840
Now that I could do.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.960
Plant the Wii Fit board firmly under your large ass.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.240
Lean left to cast black magic.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.960
Lean right to cast white magic.

03:34.960 --> 03:35.960
I don't know.

03:35.960 --> 03:36.960
Silly.

03:36.960 --> 03:41.600
Well, one game that won't be using the Wii Fit board or any Wii peripheral for that matter

03:41.600 --> 03:43.520
is Project Hammer.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.080
This is going back and forth, though.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.080
Some people...

03:46.080 --> 03:50.920
Now, there's an earlier report earlier this week that says Project Hammer is not being

03:50.920 --> 03:51.920
canceled.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.400
That people were just kind of blowing it out of proportion.

03:57.400 --> 04:02.240
There was a spokesperson that was actually at E3 that said, disaster is still under development,

04:02.240 --> 04:04.520
speaking about disaster day of crisis.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.080
We've shifted development resources from Project Hammer.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.200
You may hear about it in the future, but it's off the schedule for now.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.920
Then there was a report on Dig today that said that Project Hammer was gone.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.880
I couldn't tell if it was a misinterpretation of the story or what was going on.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.520
Have you heard anything about Project Hammer?

04:20.520 --> 04:24.400
No, but it's impossible that they misinterpreted the story.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.200
There was one also about that Wii Fit board story.

04:28.200 --> 04:34.000
They were saying, oh my God, they're going to make Final Fantasy Fit, an exercise game,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
but they were being sarcastic in the interview because they're like, are you guys going to

04:37.000 --> 04:40.800
make a Final Fantasy Health fitness game?

04:40.800 --> 04:46.720
They're all, no, but we'd more likely use it for an upcoming RPG or something.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.520
Maybe after that, then we'll work on Final Fantasy Fitness.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.280
Being sarcastic and people took it as like, oh my God, they're working on Final Fantasy

04:52.280 --> 04:53.280
Fitness.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.080
It's like, no, it's sarcasm.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.960
Look it up people, what's sarcasm?

04:58.960 --> 05:04.880
I don't know, what is it?

05:04.880 --> 05:07.160
How about some other stuff?

05:07.160 --> 05:08.160
Other stuff?

05:08.160 --> 05:14.400
Well, for those who are keeping track of the numbers, well, the Wii is about ready to kick

05:14.400 --> 05:17.960
the pants off of the Xbox 360.

05:17.960 --> 05:24.640
As far as sales go worldwide, Xbox 360 is sold 10.08 million units.

05:24.640 --> 05:29.920
The Wii is at 9.05 million and PS3 is at 3.63 million.

05:29.920 --> 05:34.860
I think it's great that the Wii is just a million short of the Xbox 360 for having been

05:34.860 --> 05:37.000
up for a shorter amount of time.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.360
As far as the DS, it's 44.97 million units versus the PSP's 22.15 million.

05:45.360 --> 05:49.200
I wouldn't have thought there's more PSPs out there than Xbox 360s though, but then

05:49.200 --> 05:51.200
again, the PSP has been out a long time.

05:51.200 --> 05:56.200
Well, more people are going to want to go for the handhelds anyway.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.920
I guess I forget about families and stuff where every kid has to have their own DS or

05:59.920 --> 06:01.920
their own PSP or whatever it is, you know.

06:01.920 --> 06:05.680
Mommy, he won't give me my game.

06:05.680 --> 06:06.680
That

06:06.680 --> 06:07.680
Exactly that.

06:07.680 --> 06:14.120
Hence why I don't breed.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.040
Do you think that the Wii is going to overtake the 360 very soon?

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
Yes.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.740
It's already proven.

06:20.740 --> 06:21.740
It all depends.

06:21.740 --> 06:28.040
It probably will just because they keep selling at a consistent rate, but at the same time,

06:28.040 --> 06:31.920
we don't know what Microsoft has up their sleeves and obviously they're not just going

06:31.920 --> 06:35.340
to let them take the top spot.

06:35.340 --> 06:40.040
If you look at it this way, the Xbox 360, as I'm aware, should already be on a slight

06:40.040 --> 06:44.980
decline ever since it reached the peak unless, of course, they come out because I don't really

06:44.980 --> 06:48.560
think that the new units are going to be much of a reason to go buy a new one.

06:48.560 --> 06:53.140
But the Wii, however, it's really, really sort of a wildfire kind of thing.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.120
The more people that are getting it, the more they're telling other people and it really

06:56.120 --> 06:59.320
appeals to much broader demographics.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.640
Microsoft does have Halo 3 in the wings and that's going to move us a little bit.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.640
Next.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.040
We have some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelandtrady.com.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.160
We love having the folks talking here.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.400
Dr. Foeve says, that's not fair.

07:12.400 --> 07:18.540
If the 360 in PlayStation 3 was $249, it would destroy the Wii's numbers.

07:18.540 --> 07:19.540
But it's not.

07:19.540 --> 07:23.600
I mean, that's kind of like part of the charm of the Wii and the reason why a lot of families

07:23.600 --> 07:29.360
and soccer moms are going for it is not just the whole like, oh, my kids can get up and

07:29.360 --> 07:30.360
move around and so can I.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.360
But it's cheap.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.360
It's cheap on the market.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.160
I'm considering the hit for people who care about that, which I'm really not, but people

07:36.160 --> 07:42.680
who care about their graphical quality, the Wii is really not as big of a graphic powerhouse

07:42.680 --> 07:45.800
as the Xbox 360 or the PS3 will be.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.440
But then again, the people who are playing the Wii are the people who actually like to

07:48.440 --> 07:49.760
play a good game.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.680
Well, I don't know.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.840
I would say care more about game play than they do about how it looks.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.880
But see, there's very few good games on the Wii.

07:56.880 --> 08:01.600
I mean, you got Zelda, yes, but after that, I mean, there's not a lot of like...

08:01.600 --> 08:02.600
Games.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.760
But most of them are like mini games, a lot, a lot, a lot.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.760
You know what I mean?

08:06.760 --> 08:07.760
Over and over.

08:07.760 --> 08:08.760
No, there's actual games.

08:08.760 --> 08:14.360
Like maybe Trauma Center, but there's not a lot of like long-lasting type games.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.040
Even Cookin' Mama lost its thrill for me.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.280
It was more of a DS game for me.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.080
By the way, I need to borrow that.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.480
There it is.

08:21.480 --> 08:26.480
Anyways, well, PlayStation 3 may be dead last in the whole thing, but at least they have

08:26.480 --> 08:27.480
something to brag about.

08:27.480 --> 08:33.720
Other than that, it would be that they're selling twice as many PlayStation 3s in Japan

08:33.720 --> 08:37.240
than they are Xbox 360s.

08:37.240 --> 08:42.800
Of course, they've reached their 1 million mark in Japan, and Microsoft is still trailing

08:42.800 --> 08:44.440
behind.

08:44.440 --> 08:50.960
But it's only going to get stronger, I guess, with releases from both companies can actually

08:50.960 --> 08:53.160
be pretty good in Japan, I think.

08:53.160 --> 08:57.040
See there's Microsoft's real problem, because in that last story, we were looking at the

08:57.040 --> 09:00.800
worldwide numbers, where the Wii is starting to overtake the 360.

09:00.800 --> 09:06.280
Well, the reason why the 360 has not had a further gap on the Wii is because it's still

09:06.280 --> 09:11.320
not cracking the market in Japan, which is interesting, because they've had games like

09:11.320 --> 09:14.640
Blue Dragon now for a little bit, and did Eternal Sonata come out there finally?

09:14.640 --> 09:17.760
I think it did, or Trusty Bell, whatever it's called.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.520
These games are not moving as many units as folks thought it would.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.280
So I think that's the 360's biggest problem when you're going to look at the worldwide

09:23.280 --> 09:25.240
numbers is that they still cannot crack Japan.

09:25.240 --> 09:31.920
Well, they have 2.5 million Wiis in Japan as well, so, you know, whereas they may be

09:31.920 --> 09:35.040
outselling the 360, they're still not number one.

09:35.040 --> 09:40.640
But I don't know, Japan is an important market, it's not the largest market, though, and if

09:40.640 --> 09:45.240
they're looking for numbers, I mean, I still think they need to focus, I guess, on the

09:45.240 --> 09:47.560
U.S. and the U.K.

09:47.560 --> 09:52.840
Well, who knows, maybe these will help move some Xboxes, but probably not.

09:52.840 --> 09:58.400
Some new demos are out on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and the demos are for Juiced 2, because you

09:58.400 --> 10:03.360
know the Japanese love their Juiced, and FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, because I think that's big

10:03.360 --> 10:05.080
over there in Tokyo as well.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.960
It's going to be in the U.K., actually, the FlatOut one, which reminds me, I need to get

10:08.960 --> 10:12.400
a U.K. account so I can download that, because I love me some FlatOut.

10:12.400 --> 10:18.000
Well, those games are actually, it's funny, because actually the demo for Juiced 2 is

10:18.000 --> 10:22.520
actually not available in Japan, so that won't move any units over there.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.480
FlatOut Racing, by the way, is only available in Europe, as Loki already referred to.

10:26.480 --> 10:30.920
These are new racing games coming out, because, you know, if there's one thing the Xbox 360

10:30.920 --> 10:33.720
is completely lacking, it's racing games.

10:33.720 --> 10:38.120
Now, now, FlatOut, though, you would like FlatOut, because FlatOut is a little bit like

10:38.120 --> 10:45.000
Burnout, except it's not as fast, but if you crash, you can eject your driver through the

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
windshield.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.400
Ooh, I might have to try this.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.920
Okay, I will download this demo.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.880
I like the idea of an eject button.

10:51.880 --> 10:58.520
Well, speaking of eject, but here's the best part about it, Rob, they have a whole set

10:58.520 --> 11:05.600
of mini-games based around ejecting the driver out, including basketball, bowling, high jump,

11:05.600 --> 11:06.600
all sorts of things.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.040
Can I eject him into a wall of pillows?

11:09.040 --> 11:10.040
Uh-huh.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.040
Amazing.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.280
How about a stack of Twinkies?

11:14.280 --> 11:17.280
Instead of a cream filling, it's a blood filling.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.280
Ew.

11:18.280 --> 11:24.960
Well, Xbox, poor, poor Microsoft.

11:24.960 --> 11:31.620
At the report for the end of their fiscal year for June 30th, they reported a 1.9 billion

11:31.620 --> 11:33.400
dollar loss.

11:33.400 --> 11:40.160
1.2 billion was from the fourth quarter when they said, hey, guess what, the Red Ring of

11:40.160 --> 11:43.480
Death are bad.

11:43.480 --> 11:51.960
However, they're expecting to hopefully redeem themselves soon, I don't know, we'll see.

11:51.960 --> 11:52.960
Well...

11:52.960 --> 11:56.880
Maybe they'll drop the price for real?

11:56.880 --> 12:00.520
I think that's what's coming, and I think when we talk about that whole sales thing

12:00.520 --> 12:04.320
earlier, I think a price drop is coming, definitely before Christmas, probably about the time

12:04.320 --> 12:05.320
Halo 3 is.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.200
They're gonna bank way too much on Halo 3, pulling in money, and the sad thing is that

12:08.200 --> 12:09.200
I think they will.

12:09.200 --> 12:13.400
I know, I'm like, it's actually probably what's best for them.

12:13.400 --> 12:20.280
But they're not just banking on Halo 3, there's Halo 3, Project Author Racing 4, Mass Effect,

12:20.280 --> 12:22.480
Grand Theft Auto 4, all those big titles that are...

12:22.480 --> 12:25.960
Eternal Sonata is the game I'm most excited about, sadly, out of everything.

12:25.960 --> 12:30.640
There's a huge lineup, they're not all banking just on Halo 3.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.920
Carcassonne 2?

12:33.920 --> 12:39.200
But Sonya's doing the same thing, they've got a pretty good lineup for the fall, just

12:39.200 --> 12:44.160
there isn't as much.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.880
Well how does this whole Red Rings thing ultimately impact Microsoft?

12:47.880 --> 12:51.680
Well, it's already impacted them.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.600
They're having to extend all those warranties on top of it, you know.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.760
Yeah, they're gonna have to sell millions more systems.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.480
That's money out of their pocket.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.160
Well it's not getting any better for them.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.140
Should've done it right the first time, hi!

13:02.140 --> 13:04.640
They're gonna greenlight Halo 4 now.

13:04.640 --> 13:13.440
They're phasing a second class action lawsuit regarding the scratched disc issue, and really,

13:13.440 --> 13:18.360
you know, they are to blame for this, I mean, it's such a simple fix.

13:18.360 --> 13:25.920
The issue comes from people jiggling the Xbox 360 while the disc is spinning, causing the

13:25.920 --> 13:30.300
actual laser to scratch a nice little ring into the disc.

13:30.300 --> 13:33.840
Why would you pick up your Xbox 360 and shake it while the disc is moving?

13:33.840 --> 13:34.840
Here's why.

13:34.840 --> 13:39.920
Maybe you think it's a baby.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.800
A lot of people are fascinated by, there's a little mercury switch in there that when

13:44.800 --> 13:51.680
you tilt your 360, whether it's upright or laying flat, the rings always face, like the

13:51.680 --> 13:53.400
one player ring will stay in the top corner.

13:53.400 --> 13:57.480
Did you say people are fascinated by the mercury switch?

13:57.480 --> 13:59.560
Yes.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.720
People are retarded, okay?

14:01.720 --> 14:07.760
Because anybody that's either knocked this thing over or for whatever reason, just playing

14:07.760 --> 14:10.200
the 360 will not scratch your discs.

14:10.200 --> 14:16.760
You have to be doing something wrong for it to scratch your discs, and what's even worse

14:16.760 --> 14:20.280
about it is the whole thing could've been fixed with just a few little pads of foam

14:20.280 --> 14:21.280
in there.

14:21.280 --> 14:27.040
We're just not shaking your Xbox 360 to watch the light tip up and down, or take the disc

14:27.040 --> 14:28.200
out if you're gonna do that.

14:28.200 --> 14:34.640
Or even better, just, you know, I don't know, don't be retarded with it.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.480
And yeah, the chatroom agrees over at chat.orangetalk.com.

14:37.480 --> 14:41.700
Blaze says, well, people shouldn't be dumb shits and do stupid things like that.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.920
And Son of Dad thinks it happens because there's candy inside.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.880
It's like a pinata, you shake it.

14:46.880 --> 14:50.200
Viva pinata, I get it.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.040
You're especially funny tonight, Miklata.

14:52.040 --> 14:56.560
I'm always funny when I talk, over, over.

14:56.560 --> 15:02.760
Blaze says, I've had my 360 get knocked over on me.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.640
It looked like a stapler got shot into the disc 20 times.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.480
I thought when I first read that, I thought he said that's what he did to the person that

15:09.480 --> 15:10.480
knocked it over.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.760
He shot a stapler into him 20 times.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.760
I'm thinking that would hurt.

15:12.760 --> 15:17.760
That reminds me of that scene in the UHF where he shoots him with the staple gun.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.080
See, that's the thing, though.

15:19.080 --> 15:24.160
I don't understand how, okay, granted, it should've been fixed.

15:24.160 --> 15:31.000
The foam in there couldn't have cost less than a dollar to fix this thing.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
I don't know why...

15:32.000 --> 15:33.080
That's a whole dollar.

15:33.080 --> 15:37.260
It's less than a dollar, okay, to fix this.

15:37.260 --> 15:40.720
I don't know why they didn't, but for whatever reason, they didn't.

15:40.720 --> 15:46.220
Either way, though, still, don't jiggle the machine.

15:46.220 --> 15:50.280
It says in the manual not to do it, but then again, the Wii manual says not to throw it

15:50.280 --> 15:55.160
through your TV, and people do that anyway, so I guess, you know...

15:55.160 --> 15:56.660
They want to sue Nintendo.

15:56.660 --> 15:59.680
The Wii broke my TV because it doesn't bounce.

15:59.680 --> 16:04.680
I guess, you know, it's like, I don't know what you got to do.

16:04.680 --> 16:08.160
Walk these people through how to handle their console.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.440
Don't shake the console.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.840
It doesn't like it.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.120
It will scratch your disc.

16:12.120 --> 16:16.000
Have you ever seen those posters like Downtown when you're driving or whatever that says

16:16.000 --> 16:17.440
don't shake your baby?

16:17.440 --> 16:18.440
A message from the...

16:18.440 --> 16:23.040
Actually, the headquarters for that is right by where I work, and after talking with some

16:23.040 --> 16:30.960
of those people, no, because the whole thing started because a nanny shaped this guy's

16:30.960 --> 16:32.200
baby and killed her.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.200
Oh my God.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.200
I mean, it's sad.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.300
I'm not trying to make light of it, but you have to admit it's fascinating that there

16:37.300 --> 16:40.560
is a headquarters dedicated to not shaking babies.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.680
It's like, dude, common sense.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.440
You're dealing with somebody who is not fully developed.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.600
Why would you shake them?

16:48.600 --> 16:53.560
Well, the Xbox 360 is not fully developed either, so don't shake it.

16:53.560 --> 17:02.400
I want to work for that company and work in their product test support and see if one

17:02.400 --> 17:05.040
day they make a model of a baby that can be shaking.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.040
Heart babies.

17:06.040 --> 17:15.440
I like them when they're quiet.

17:15.440 --> 17:19.440
I like them with a straw in their head to drink.

17:19.440 --> 17:23.160
What is wrong with you?

17:23.160 --> 17:24.160
So real quick...

17:24.160 --> 17:25.160
Seriously?

17:25.160 --> 17:26.680
Video games, Rob.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.000
Back to video games.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Is video games what caused you to be so violent?

17:30.000 --> 17:35.880
I would, however, like to encourage our listeners to go to DontShakeYourBaby.com.

17:35.880 --> 17:40.520
Just don't shake babies, and don't shake Xbox 360s, and while you're at it, just don't

17:40.520 --> 17:46.520
shake people or things in general unless they're stupid and then throttle them, or unless it's

17:46.520 --> 17:50.280
a can of Coke that you're about to hand to your friend to watch them open.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.280
That is funny.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.280
Nothing else is.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.280
You can shake your booty.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.640
Well, yes, and watch me shake my ass right now.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.640
Here's the better part.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.640
That's the whole thing.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.640
Right in front of my face, though.

17:58.640 --> 17:59.640
Thank you.

17:59.640 --> 18:04.760
The plaintiff to this whole case, Christine Moskowitz, she says she was displeased when

18:04.760 --> 18:10.800
the Xbox 360 she purchased for her son wrote copies of Gears of War, Crackdown, and Saints

18:10.800 --> 18:11.800
Row.

18:11.800 --> 18:18.360
A second plaintiff, Dan Wood, claimed that his system ruined Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell

18:18.360 --> 18:19.360
disc.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.080
Okay, she purchased it for her son.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.080
How old is her son?

18:22.080 --> 18:24.760
Because I think those are all M-rated games.

18:24.760 --> 18:25.760
Hmm?

18:25.760 --> 18:26.760
Hmm?

18:26.760 --> 18:27.760
Yeah.

18:27.760 --> 18:38.040
Anyways, I'm sorry, assuming that he is the proper age to use or to play those games,

18:38.040 --> 18:44.240
I'm sorry, wouldn't you learn, hmm, shaking it broke one of my games.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.400
Maybe I shouldn't do that.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.760
What's that grinding noise?

18:47.760 --> 18:50.760
Instead, he's like, hmm, I'll put a different disc in there.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.760
Hmm, it makes the noise again.

18:52.760 --> 18:57.880
Oh, we better sue them because we're at $150.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.080
Boo-fucking-hoo.

19:01.080 --> 19:06.240
I think this calls for an Orange Lounge Radio Public Service Announcement, so if we may,

19:06.240 --> 19:10.760
let's bring on an Orange Lounge Radio Public Service Announcement.

19:10.760 --> 19:11.760
Camera please.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.760
Alright, thank you.

19:12.760 --> 19:13.760
Ready?

19:13.760 --> 19:16.760
Lights, camera, and action.

19:16.760 --> 19:29.800
Hi, this is Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you not to shake your Xbox

19:29.800 --> 19:37.200
360 because if you do, then you deserve to have your $60 games broke down on you.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.400
Also, please don't shake children.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.960
That was the worst public service announcement ever.

19:42.960 --> 19:47.720
Can we get back into stories, please?

19:47.720 --> 19:48.720
No.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.720
Well, the next story is mine.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.320
Okay, fine.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.600
Let's talk about Metal Gear Solid 4 on the Xbox 360.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
That's okay, never mind.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.600
No, seriously.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.600
Seriously, I know.

19:59.600 --> 20:05.480
I don't know why I'm bringing this up, but Metal Gear Solid 4 again is rumored to go

20:05.480 --> 20:12.640
on the Xbox 360, and I'm thinking, did they just not have E3 happen, and did they not

20:12.640 --> 20:16.880
just reconfirm that the game is going to be a PS3 exclusive and all this, blah, blah,

20:16.880 --> 20:17.880
blah?

20:17.880 --> 20:21.600
Well, the official Xbox Magazine comes out and says that it's going to be coming to the

20:21.600 --> 20:28.880
Xbox 360 a few months after the PlayStation 3 version, and this is just after Kazumi Kitawe

20:28.880 --> 20:33.040
said at E3, since Metal Gear Solid was born for the PlayStation, we'd like to keep it

20:33.040 --> 20:38.760
as a PlayStation game, but we might have to take some steps, and that's the whole reason

20:38.760 --> 20:41.780
why people are thinking again it's coming to the Xbox 360.

20:41.780 --> 20:44.120
I'm just thinking, let it go!

20:44.120 --> 20:45.120
Let it go!

20:45.120 --> 20:48.120
Here's the other thing, though.

20:48.120 --> 20:55.240
To argue for it coming to the 360, hasn't everything that Sony's basically told...

20:55.240 --> 21:01.120
I know this is not Sony, but they're speaking for the Sony platform, I guess.

21:01.120 --> 21:06.160
Hasn't everything that they've denied come true anyways?

21:06.160 --> 21:09.320
And granted, they probably don't want to make an announcement that it's actually coming

21:09.320 --> 21:16.760
out for Xbox 360, because then that pretty much shoots their chance for an actual really

21:16.760 --> 21:22.000
good exclusive game coming to their platform.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.400
I'm just bothered by the fact that they can't get away from this, and this comes up a week

21:27.400 --> 21:33.040
after E3, when they got up there and reaffirmed it's coming out for PlayStation 3 only.

21:33.040 --> 21:38.520
If they do have plans for the Xbox 360, it's going to be a huge time difference in the

21:38.520 --> 21:42.140
releases, because I don't think they'll bring it out until the PlayStation 3 has proved

21:42.140 --> 21:45.120
it can't sell the copies that Konami wants it to sell.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.120
So I don't know.

21:46.120 --> 21:50.440
I just get very bothered by all these constant, like every week there's some new stupid rumor

21:50.440 --> 21:53.520
about Metal Gear Solid 4 around all the different game blogs.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.400
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

21:55.400 --> 22:01.580
But I mean, it's going to be a long time after the release of the initial game, right?

22:01.580 --> 22:04.360
If it does happen, it'll be a long time after, right?

22:04.360 --> 22:05.360
Right.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.360
I think so.

22:06.360 --> 22:12.040
When I have to read the same news story four, five times across the scope of a couple months

22:12.040 --> 22:16.400
just because some stupid rumor ignites all the blogs around the world, I get angsty.

22:16.400 --> 22:20.460
I don't know about the rest of you, but it seems like no better time to bring out the

22:20.460 --> 22:24.800
FUs of the Week.

22:24.800 --> 22:33.360
Jamie, start us off please with the FUs of the Week.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.800
I actually have a two-part one because one's related to the other.

22:36.800 --> 22:42.400
First of all, I'd like to say FU to laminate flooring because, okay, this is how I broke

22:42.400 --> 22:43.400
my ribs.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.400
Okay.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.120
I had just got back from the gym and I stepped into the tub.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.240
I did not even sit down.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.880
I just stepped into the tub and my phone rang.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.080
So I stepped out, dried off my feet.

22:53.080 --> 22:58.240
I made sure to dry off my feet, stepped into the hallway and down I went.

22:58.240 --> 23:02.600
And I fell sort of skewed with my elbow into my side and I banged my knee really hard and

23:02.600 --> 23:05.000
I thought that all I hurt was my knee.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.440
The next morning I woke up and my ribs were blue and I hurt quite a bit.

23:09.440 --> 23:13.400
So I went to the doctor that day and he put me in a lot of Vicodin.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.680
And I'm fully functional on Vicodin.

23:15.680 --> 23:21.640
I can go to my job and do my work and I'm fine as long as I'm focused on one thing.

23:21.640 --> 23:24.860
But when I take it, I can't really do...

23:24.860 --> 23:30.160
I'm not the multitasker I normally am and Rob, you know how I do 50 million things at

23:30.160 --> 23:31.160
once.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.160
I don't pay attention to that many things.

23:33.160 --> 23:40.680
So I was in a conversation with somebody who is a wonderful, funny person, very nice person

23:40.680 --> 23:46.920
who I think takes things a little too personally sometimes.

23:46.920 --> 23:51.160
She linked me to this product that I didn't think was very funny.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.360
It's a bird feeder that flings squirrels off.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.040
That's sad for squirrels.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.040
I know squirrels.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.200
Well, see, that's what I thought.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.420
I like squirrels better than birds.

24:00.420 --> 24:06.320
And I thought it was funny, I thought it was a good product as long as it doesn't hurt

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
the poor squirrels.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.480
How about a bird feeder that flings birds off?

24:09.480 --> 24:10.480
That would be funny.

24:10.480 --> 24:11.480
That would be great.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.480
I like birds though, too.

24:12.480 --> 24:17.080
I used to actually buy bird feeders that squirrels could get on and I would put nuts in it.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.280
Or a bird feeder that kicks them in the nuts.

24:19.280 --> 24:22.320
No, no, let me finish, okay?

24:22.320 --> 24:26.320
And so, it's just like, sorry for offending you and slide off.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.760
I'm not saying I'm who it is because I'm a nice person.

24:29.760 --> 24:34.760
But it's, I was like, dude, if I wasn't, I wasn't offended and I was offended now, you

24:34.760 --> 24:35.760
know what I mean?

24:35.760 --> 24:41.600
It's like, first of all, everybody, when you're dealing with people, don't fucking make assumptions

24:41.600 --> 24:42.960
about how they feel.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.680
Ask them first, how do you feel?

24:45.680 --> 24:51.000
All you're going to do is piss them off and, you know, cause drama that doesn't need to

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
be caused.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.600
You need to not, people need to not be afraid to ask someone how they feel.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.960
Don't make assumptions.

24:58.960 --> 25:03.960
All it does is make an ass out of you and only you, okay?

25:03.960 --> 25:09.160
You know, I think that it's just this whole, oh, I don't want to offend people and I don't

25:09.160 --> 25:11.560
want to, well then fucking ask.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.040
You know, what's the worst thing they're going to say?

25:13.040 --> 25:15.800
Oh, you know, I don't feel all that great about it right now and if they don't want

25:15.800 --> 25:18.640
to talk about it, they'll fucking tell you I don't want to talk about it right now and

25:18.640 --> 25:19.640
respect it.

25:19.640 --> 25:25.240
You know, don't just assume because then I've been, you know, pissed off now for three days

25:25.240 --> 25:32.720
over this and you know, I'm a good, I'm a good person, I think I'm a good person, you

25:32.720 --> 25:33.720
know.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.720
Don't you think I'm a good person?

25:35.720 --> 25:36.720
Yeah, okay.

25:36.720 --> 25:42.200
But I just think that, you know, instead of worrying about, you know, kid gloves and stepping

25:42.200 --> 25:45.800
on toes, if you don't want to step on toes, ask them where their toes are so that you

25:45.800 --> 25:46.800
don't step on them.

25:46.800 --> 25:47.800
That's what I think.

25:47.800 --> 25:48.800
Good?

25:48.800 --> 25:49.800
All finished?

25:49.800 --> 25:58.600
I think that I was fairly, um, I had tact in my words, don't you think?

25:58.600 --> 26:01.440
I was going to say tactical, but that's what you're trying to kill people.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.640
Okay, we got to keep it going.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.640
Loki, your FU is the weed.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.480
FU to paper Mario sucking.

26:09.480 --> 26:14.680
Why did I spend $10 on that?

26:14.680 --> 26:19.880
My FU of the week goes to Shane, um, because he was plotting against me in the beginning

26:19.880 --> 26:25.920
of Survivor LJ to get me kicked out and, uh, you're, you're a jerk.

26:25.920 --> 26:26.920
Still does.

26:26.920 --> 26:27.920
Hey, wait a minute.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.920
Wait a minute.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.920
Whoa.

26:29.920 --> 26:30.920
I get FU, right?

26:30.920 --> 26:31.920
Yes.

26:31.920 --> 26:32.920
Your turn.

26:32.920 --> 26:33.920
F U.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.920
Oh, crap.

26:34.920 --> 26:35.920
I had one.

26:35.920 --> 26:36.920
Where did it go?

26:36.920 --> 26:37.920
Okay.

26:37.920 --> 26:38.920
I have two FUs.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.920
One I can remember, then I'll come up with the other one in a second.

26:41.920 --> 26:46.680
FU to Europe or the UK or whatever, because they got that location test for the Silent

26:46.680 --> 26:52.120
Hill Arcade game and it looks really sweet and I want to play it so bad, um, and I'm

26:52.120 --> 26:56.520
not going to fly over there to play it, but maybe I will someday.

26:56.520 --> 27:01.440
And then FU to, um, next, not this coming Tuesday, but next Tuesday, because it'll be

27:01.440 --> 27:10.920
the final day of the Konami San Francisco offices, and that'll be the end of that.

27:10.920 --> 27:11.920
Okay.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.280
That's that.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.640
All done with the FUs of the week.

27:16.640 --> 27:20.760
Let's move on and back into the gaming news, then.

27:20.760 --> 27:25.000
Well, and this makes me kind of laugh because it's kind of a stupid name, but there's

27:25.000 --> 27:30.720
a new princess for Super Mario Galaxies that they have, uh, seen, uh, in Famitsu scans

27:30.720 --> 27:35.060
named Rosetta, and I just want to, I think Stone instantly, because you know the Rosetta

27:35.060 --> 27:37.040
Stone was a big translator thing.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.040
Anyway.

27:38.040 --> 27:42.680
So, she used to hang out with Daisy and Peach and, and, watch your face, who wasn't even

27:42.680 --> 27:46.040
a princess from the first game, Pauline.

27:46.040 --> 27:51.240
She was a princess, she was just some hoochie from New York, so she doesn't need to be

27:51.240 --> 27:52.240
the princesses.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.240
Pauline.

27:53.240 --> 27:56.920
She's not good enough to be a princess, she's just a hooker.

27:56.920 --> 28:00.400
Pauline wasn't in, uh, the Super Mario Brothers movie, was she?

28:00.400 --> 28:01.400
She's Donkey Kong.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.400
I don't think so.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.400
She's just Donkey Kong.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.400
She's Mario Brothers First Love.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.960
And that's when he found out his, that Peach would put out, I guess, I don't know.

28:08.960 --> 28:13.800
But, um, she's, she's, I guess, pretty.

28:13.800 --> 28:19.120
If you like, you know, dumb blondes, I guess, no, I don't know.

28:19.120 --> 28:25.260
Well, fear not, folks, um, we talked a little bit about the Wii Balance Board and Part A,

28:25.260 --> 28:30.640
but, um, Nintendo has come out to promise that there will be, they will be making more

28:30.640 --> 28:36.040
Balance Board based games, so it's, you're not going to be buying this thing for only

28:36.040 --> 28:38.040
one game.

28:38.040 --> 28:41.040
Hooray!

28:41.040 --> 28:42.040
What else are they developing?

28:42.040 --> 28:43.040
Have they said anything?

28:43.040 --> 28:44.040
No!

28:44.040 --> 28:45.040
They did not.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.760
They just said, yeah, we're working on stuff.

28:47.760 --> 28:53.600
Gee, could it possibly be, I don't know, another game that involves a lot of mini games?

28:53.600 --> 28:57.480
Possibly, and I'm going to guess, uh, the next WarioWare game.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.880
Oh, God, probably.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.880
That would make sense.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.440
That might be fun, though.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.360
I did like WarioWare on the Wii, I'll give you that.

29:05.360 --> 29:08.200
Well, this might be kind of fun on the Wii as well, even though I already own this game

29:08.200 --> 29:13.760
on the Xbox 360, but Rockstar Table Tennis is coming out for the Wii.

29:13.760 --> 29:17.400
Rockstar has confirmed that the game is coming out, but that's really about it.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.840
It's just saying that the game is coming, it will take full advantage of the Wii Remote

29:20.840 --> 29:25.280
and everything that comes with that, and, uh, there's another quote here, quote, a new

29:25.280 --> 29:29.240
audience can now experience a game that is beautifully designed and impossible to put

29:29.240 --> 29:30.240
down.

29:30.240 --> 29:34.480
Rockstar Table Tennis was kind of one of those early hits on the Xbox 360, one of the earlier

29:34.480 --> 29:38.120
games I enjoy, but it would be interesting to see how the game mechanics are going to

29:38.120 --> 29:39.120
change on the Wii.

29:39.120 --> 29:47.520
As long as they had the Nunchuck part actually move you, and the Wiimote beard, with a paddle,

29:47.520 --> 29:48.520
is that what it's called?

29:48.520 --> 29:49.520
Yeah.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.520
Then I don't see any problem with it.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.520
It should be actually pretty fun.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.280
I wonder how this is going to work with the different spins that you put on your ball,

29:53.280 --> 29:56.480
because that was a big part of the game, was that you had to look at the tiny little, the

29:56.480 --> 30:00.360
ball that was coming at you, and the tiny color that surrounded it so you could tell

30:00.360 --> 30:03.720
what way it was spinning, and then you counter with different types of spins.

30:03.720 --> 30:07.800
Maybe hold down an A button when you do it, or the this button back here that you guys

30:07.800 --> 30:10.360
can see me pointing at with my imaginary Wiimote.

30:10.360 --> 30:14.320
I don't know which one this is called anymore because I don't own a Wii anymore.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.320
Why did you get rid of your Wii?

30:15.320 --> 30:16.880
Because I didn't play it.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.760
I let it stay broken for like five months.

30:18.760 --> 30:19.760
Who'd you sell it to?

30:19.760 --> 30:20.760
How'd you sell it?

30:20.760 --> 30:24.440
I had a friend of a friend that wanted one, so I was like, give me money, I'll give you

30:24.440 --> 30:25.440
this Wii.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.440
But wasn't it a broken Wii?

30:26.440 --> 30:27.440
Like you had to send it back to Nintendo?

30:27.440 --> 30:28.440
I sent it back to Nintendo.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.440
They gave me a brand new one completely.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.440
Oh, okay.

30:30.440 --> 30:31.440
So.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.440
So you sold your friend a brand new Wii?

30:32.440 --> 30:33.440
Yes.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.440
Amazing.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.720
Just like how I sold my friend my 360 one time, and like a month later it got the Red

30:36.720 --> 30:37.720
Rings of Death.

30:37.720 --> 30:42.640
I felt really happy about that because I avoided it.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.640
You are evil.

30:43.640 --> 30:44.640
Yes.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.640
All right.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.840
Well, I'll definitely check out the game when it comes to the Wii, but I don't know if I

30:48.840 --> 30:50.200
want to spend all that money on it.

30:50.200 --> 30:54.480
That's why I wish the Wii had demos.

30:54.480 --> 30:59.280
But if they had demos, then how would they get you to buy $10 games for Nintendo 64 on

30:59.280 --> 31:00.760
it?

31:00.760 --> 31:01.760
Good question.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.200
Maybe you should have played them when they originally came out, then you would know if

31:04.200 --> 31:06.160
they sucked or not.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.000
But I can get videos on Nintendo.com.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Great.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.720
I can watch YouTube.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.200
So guess what?

31:13.200 --> 31:14.200
What?

31:14.200 --> 31:17.920
Atari likes horses, and people who love horses.

31:17.920 --> 31:23.800
They're coming out with a game called My Horse and Me for Wii DS and PC that, from what I

31:23.800 --> 31:30.320
can understand, it's a horse-raising and riding simulation.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.800
Ride them horses, huh?

31:32.800 --> 31:38.360
Well, they're basically, and there's a quote on here saying, we're looking forward to providing

31:38.360 --> 31:43.440
the horse-enthusiastic community with a rich and authentic game that allows gamers to take

31:43.440 --> 31:46.280
care of and complete a variety of challenges with their horse.

31:46.280 --> 31:50.480
Is there a big cross-section of the population that are horse enthusiasts and video game

31:50.480 --> 31:51.480
players?

31:51.480 --> 31:54.400
I know, but they're the same type that play video games?

31:54.400 --> 31:59.680
I know a person who's a horse enthusiast who loves video games, and she likes playing Guitar

31:59.680 --> 32:00.680
Hero Drunk.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.680
One.

32:01.680 --> 32:02.680
So you know one.

32:02.680 --> 32:06.280
Out of all the horse games, though, out there, you should consider this one, because the

32:06.280 --> 32:11.800
game features the most accurate horse models and animations yet realized in a video game.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.480
I think I would play it.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.360
Take that, Final Furlong.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.080
You know what I say to this game?

32:17.080 --> 32:18.080
Nay.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.480
I think I'm going to get the game.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.480
I really think I'll play it.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.040
Well, have fun.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.440
Can you whip the horse with a Wiimote?

32:25.440 --> 32:26.440
That might make me change my mind.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.440
That might be kind of fun.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.440
Maybe.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.800
And then I can name the horse Britney Spears, and I can whip Britney Spears, just like it

32:30.800 --> 32:32.280
was Derby Owners Club.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.600
I love Derby Owners Club, okay?

32:33.600 --> 32:34.600
I know you do.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.600
There you go.

32:36.600 --> 32:39.940
The Rob D says, you know, I've always been begging the video game industry for accurate

32:39.940 --> 32:40.940
horse physics.

32:40.940 --> 32:42.940
I'm glad they listened.

32:42.940 --> 32:46.120
I have a feeling that might be some of that sarcasm thing somebody was talking about earlier.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.120
I don't know.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.120
Possibly.

32:49.120 --> 32:54.280
Anyways, another game coming out by Take-Two and Rockstar, Bully.

32:54.280 --> 32:58.720
The scholarship edition is now coming to the Xbox 360 and the Wii.

32:58.720 --> 33:03.520
So, you know, you thought before that you may be able to get your, you know, Grand Theft

33:03.520 --> 33:07.480
Auto on on the Wii with Manhunt 2.

33:07.480 --> 33:13.240
Hopefully you'll be able to get your Bully on, I guess, with the Wii sooner than that.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.080
But I don't know.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.480
It got a teen rating before.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.640
I don't see why we get any more than a teen rating now.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.520
I'm looking forward to maybe picking this up on the 360.

33:22.520 --> 33:27.540
Yeah, I'm kind of glad I missed it the last round on the PlayStation 2, because I was

33:27.540 --> 33:29.760
so immersed in my 360 at that time.

33:29.760 --> 33:33.700
I'm kind of glad they are going to put it on 360 after all, so I can play it in high

33:33.700 --> 33:35.800
def and widescreen and all that good stuff.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.680
And I believe it will have new content as well for it, so...

33:39.680 --> 33:41.480
More guys to make out with?

33:41.480 --> 33:43.760
Yes, more guys to make out with.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.760
Hooray!

33:44.760 --> 33:50.160
Imagine what you could do with the Wii mode.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.160
I don't know, Miklotov.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.160
What?

33:52.160 --> 33:53.160
You could write on the chalkboards.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.160
Oh, okay.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.160
You could.

33:55.160 --> 33:59.280
What were you thinking?

33:59.280 --> 34:00.280
I don't know.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.280
Geez.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.280
That's why I had to ask.

34:02.280 --> 34:10.720
Well, also coming out for the Xbox 360 is Guilty Gear 2 Overture.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.480
But here's the interesting thing.

34:12.480 --> 34:17.840
It's not supposed to be a fighting game.

34:17.840 --> 34:22.280
Basically in the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine, Guilty Gear 2 Overture was revealed to be

34:22.280 --> 34:24.960
a game a lot more like Soul Calibur Legends.

34:24.960 --> 34:30.160
It's an action title and also has a little bit of adventure thrown in for good measure.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.320
It's not a fighting game, but who cares?

34:32.320 --> 34:37.480
I'm sure a lot of fans of Guilty Gear are going to eat this up anyway, right?

34:37.480 --> 34:42.320
It does our soul bad guy.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.320
Soul is awesome.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.320
I love Soul Bad Guy.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.320
Soul Bad Guy is great.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.000
And Soul's going to be in there with a newcomer named Sin.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.800
Who looks like Kai, but who to that?

34:49.800 --> 34:51.720
I liked Eno.

34:51.720 --> 34:54.280
I was a fan of Zappa, love Zappa.

34:54.280 --> 34:55.280
And I love Faust.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.280
Oh, yeah.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.280
Faust, of course.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.280
I like Venom too.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.960
And I'm sad though, because this is before I lost all that weight, as I cosplayed Biken,

35:02.960 --> 35:06.000
which Dan didn't like because of like, you know, boob.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.120
But I found a Faust cosplayer that same year.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.120
That's awesome.

35:10.120 --> 35:13.480
Did he rape you with his scalpel, like in the game?

35:13.480 --> 35:19.760
I actually did hit him with the claw by accident, but I had to give the claw back to Evan because

35:19.760 --> 35:22.320
it was part of his toys.

35:22.320 --> 35:26.360
I won't say anything else.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.960
I'll tell you off of the show.

35:27.960 --> 35:28.960
Okay.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.960
There you go then.

35:29.960 --> 35:30.960
Ah!

35:30.960 --> 35:36.320
I'm glad you didn't say that on a mic.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.320
I'm kind of disappointed.

35:37.320 --> 35:38.320
Hey, is it my turn again?

35:38.320 --> 35:39.680
Yes, it is your turn again.

35:39.680 --> 35:47.720
Speaking of all things devilish, there is a Capcom 2D fighting game called Sengoku Basara

35:47.720 --> 35:55.960
X, or I should say pronounced as Cross, but it's a Devil Kings fighting game.

35:55.960 --> 36:01.840
It is actually based on, well Devil Kings is the name it's known by in North America.

36:01.840 --> 36:12.000
You get the Devil Kings, Scorpio, Azure Dragon, Forced, and Iron Ox, at least what their names

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
are in the U.S.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.840
But the game's supposed to hit arcades in Japan this winter.

36:17.840 --> 36:18.840
I'm looking forward to that.

36:18.840 --> 36:19.840
I know the series.

36:19.840 --> 36:24.360
I'm surprised to see that they're actually making that into a fighting game.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.800
I don't think there was that many characters, but it can't be any worse than the actual

36:28.800 --> 36:31.680
Devil Kings game.

36:31.680 --> 36:37.320
So yeah, there's this rumor going around before about Halo on the DS, and it was interesting

36:37.320 --> 36:43.720
because I believe they did get Bungie's Brian Gerard to comment on it.

36:43.720 --> 36:47.820
Apparently, there is such a thing, I guess, in concept.

36:47.820 --> 36:54.640
People have made concept versions of the game to pitch to them, but nothing, obviously,

36:54.640 --> 36:56.720
has come out.

36:56.720 --> 37:01.600
So they're saying, Microsoft, of course, doesn't publish any DS games or license them.

37:01.600 --> 37:05.200
So I don't know, will it ever get created?

37:05.200 --> 37:06.200
Who knows.

37:06.200 --> 37:13.800
But, argument's sake, there are a few different versions of Halo for the DS out there.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.440
Like what is created as jokes or what?

37:16.440 --> 37:20.160
Like pitching, like, hey, we want to bring Halo to the DS.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.720
Here's what we can do with it, and then showing them off again.

37:22.720 --> 37:26.120
What's the problem if Microsoft never plans to get into the handheld market?

37:26.120 --> 37:27.120
What's the problem?

37:27.120 --> 37:30.120
There's 44 million DSs out there to sell product to.

37:30.120 --> 37:33.240
Who says it won't happen at some point?

37:33.240 --> 37:34.240
It'd be weird.

37:34.240 --> 37:36.000
It'd be very weird.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.920
I kind of think, though, a little bit like, I don't know if it's a good thing because

37:40.920 --> 37:48.200
I mean, look at the last time they tried something like that with the CDI, remember the Mario

37:48.200 --> 37:49.200
and the...

37:49.200 --> 37:50.200
Oh, yes.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.640
Wanda Gamelan and all that stuff.

37:51.640 --> 37:52.640
All the games.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.640
Yeah.

37:53.640 --> 37:57.040
But, I mean, hey, I wish that that would kind of happen because that'd be pretty awesome.

37:57.040 --> 38:02.240
You know, have Nintendo developing games for the Xbox 360 that are a little bit higher

38:02.240 --> 38:06.520
end and then have Microsoft developing stuff for the DS.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.360
That'd be pretty cool.

38:08.360 --> 38:09.360
Good stuff.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.360
All right.

38:10.360 --> 38:15.400
Well, moving back over to the Xbox 360, which, of course, is where the Halo series will soon

38:15.400 --> 38:20.720
show up, what's going on is that there is actually a new hack out there.

38:20.720 --> 38:27.880
The Xbox hacker forums have stated that the Xbox 360's DVD key and game region code can

38:27.880 --> 38:32.440
now be altered to break down the region locks for some games.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.800
Here's a quote from the person who did it, I successfully changed the DVD key and region

38:35.800 --> 38:38.160
code of a 360, so it's all confirmed.

38:38.160 --> 38:41.520
All I did towards this was to reverse the plain text KV signature to figure out how

38:41.520 --> 38:47.320
to modify and re-sign the KV contents, but, okay, so, you know, hooray, now you might

38:47.320 --> 38:52.040
be able to reverse your 360 to play games from other regions, but Microsoft will probably

38:52.040 --> 38:53.560
close this loophole pretty soon.

38:53.560 --> 38:54.560
They usually do.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.560
I think they already have.

38:55.560 --> 39:01.040
I think it's just on some of the older kernels they can do that.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.920
The Rob D says, oh, that's all he did?

39:03.920 --> 39:05.880
I can't believe I didn't think of that.

39:05.880 --> 39:10.040
I think that might be a little more of that sarcasm thing somebody was referring to earlier

39:10.040 --> 39:11.040
in the program.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.040
I don't know.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.040
Maybe.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.040
All right.

39:14.040 --> 39:19.120
And then Shadow Charlie says, brick, the Xbox 360's going to be a brick pretty soon.

39:19.120 --> 39:22.760
They should just have a code in there when you try to do something like that and hack

39:22.760 --> 39:23.760
it.

39:23.760 --> 39:26.200
It'll just carve a nice little circle into your disk.

39:26.200 --> 39:32.640
Like your Xbox 360 commits seppuku when it figures out that you're trying to, you know,

39:32.640 --> 39:34.640
taint it.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.800
That'd be funny.

39:37.800 --> 39:44.160
Well, there is actually just a little bit more information that I have that some people

39:44.160 --> 39:45.160
might be happy about.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.520
Me, I don't really give two shits about.

39:47.520 --> 39:54.520
But Far Cry 2 will be coming out.

39:54.520 --> 39:59.560
I'm really, I don't know, I never played the first one enough to care about it.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.560
I don't know anything about it.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.440
I'm surprised that they did announce Far Cry 2 coming out, because I always thought Crisis

40:03.440 --> 40:07.440
was Far Cry 2, and I guess I was wrong.

40:07.440 --> 40:10.200
Doesn't it seem like it's been a long time since the first one came out?

40:10.200 --> 40:11.200
2004, wasn't it?

40:11.200 --> 40:15.040
Yeah, it just seems kind of weird that they would wait that long to announce a second

40:15.040 --> 40:16.040
game.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.940
Well, it's scheduled for a 2008 release.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.360
Could it be the movie and all?

40:19.360 --> 40:22.520
You want to tie a game that could possibly be good.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.520
Right.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.520
I'm just theorizing.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.520
Jesus.

40:25.520 --> 40:30.160
That's like if they would have promoted House of the Dead 3 in House of the Dead the movie

40:30.160 --> 40:31.160
or something.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.160
Should I tie that in?

40:32.160 --> 40:35.800
Nobody would have played House of the Dead 3 at all.

40:35.800 --> 40:40.480
No, I think, I don't know, it was a good first person shooter game.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.960
I like how you can make your own levels and stuff in it.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.540
That was kind of neat.

40:44.540 --> 40:47.140
Just makes me miss time splitters even more.

40:47.140 --> 40:50.520
So since Jamie and I both don't play Far Cry, you tell us, what would you want to see in

40:50.520 --> 40:53.720
Far Cry 2?

40:53.720 --> 40:54.720
I don't know.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.240
I would like to see some of the stuff that they're showing off in Crisis, because Crisis

40:58.240 --> 41:04.400
looks like such an amazing game, and Far Cry was pretty good when it came out originally.

41:04.400 --> 41:10.600
Maybe some different settings, maybe not all in the jungle, I don't know, just improve

41:10.600 --> 41:11.600
upon it.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.880
It was a pretty good game to begin with.

41:13.880 --> 41:18.440
Some of the AI though in the first game was a little weird, so maybe tune that up a bit,

41:18.440 --> 41:24.560
but if the AI is good, and the game stays kind of how it was, it should be a pretty

41:24.560 --> 41:27.080
good game.

41:27.080 --> 41:31.200
If you don't have it on the 360, I'd recommend picking it up, because it's dirt cheap now

41:31.200 --> 41:33.040
and it's actually pretty fun.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.280
Alright, well, let's move on.

41:35.280 --> 41:38.680
Any more stories before we open up the Skype line, which I believe is coming up very soon?

41:38.680 --> 41:42.000
Yes, we got one, and it's kind of interesting.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.100
Silicon Knights, they're actually going to be suing Epic over the Unreal 3 engine.

41:47.100 --> 41:54.440
Apparently they've had some difficulties programming in it, and it's not performing as they had

41:54.440 --> 41:55.440
hoped.

41:55.440 --> 42:00.400
This is kind of stemming from the showing of 2Human at E3.

42:00.400 --> 42:07.840
Apparently some people weren't too happy about it, but I don't know.

42:07.840 --> 42:11.600
Should be interesting to see what's happening with it.

42:11.600 --> 42:14.640
I know that they're not the only company that's been having trouble with it.

42:14.640 --> 42:20.560
I know for the PlayStation 3 side, Koei has been having trouble with Fatal Inertia.

42:20.560 --> 42:26.560
In fact, that game has been postponed indefinitely now.

42:26.560 --> 42:34.200
So some problems arising with this fantastic engine that everybody's been licensing, maybe.

42:34.200 --> 42:36.280
Is it just hard to work with?

42:36.280 --> 42:40.560
They might just not have all of the documentation for it or something.

42:40.560 --> 42:44.000
It sounds like they weren't getting everything they were promised, about this whole, like,

42:44.000 --> 42:47.240
there's going to be an update in six months and then it never came or whatever.

42:47.240 --> 42:51.680
But it's hard to say until we get the smoking gun publishing the full court papers so we

42:51.680 --> 42:52.680
can read it for ourselves.

42:52.680 --> 42:53.680
That'll be exciting.

42:53.680 --> 43:00.600
DJ Jenai in our chat room says, Sue Epic for ditching One Must Fall 2097.

43:00.600 --> 43:03.200
That's old school right there.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.680
I love that game.

43:05.680 --> 43:09.580
There was the One Must Fall Battlegrounds that came out, remember online, it was like

43:09.580 --> 43:12.080
a battle arena game.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.780
It's not over yet if you want to play that.

43:14.780 --> 43:15.780
You never know.

43:15.780 --> 43:18.720
All right, anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line now.

43:18.720 --> 43:25.340
If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name is Orange

43:25.340 --> 43:26.340
Lounge Radio.

43:26.340 --> 43:27.340
Who would have thought?

43:27.340 --> 43:29.920
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype is our user name.

43:29.920 --> 43:34.360
And I also want to put out there that there is a brand new version of Skype available.

43:34.360 --> 43:37.320
And this is our first night using it and they've changed the interface a little bit.

43:37.320 --> 43:42.680
I don't anticipate any problems, but you never know what might go wrong here on the program.

43:42.680 --> 43:43.960
So let's go to the phones.

43:43.960 --> 43:46.240
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.240
Who's this?

43:47.240 --> 43:48.240
Raven's Dolphin.

43:48.240 --> 43:49.240
How are you?

43:49.240 --> 43:50.240
Good.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.800
And I'm so happy that the phone picked up this time and we're not having those technical

43:52.800 --> 43:53.800
difficulties.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.240
What's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

43:55.240 --> 43:56.240
The Epic thing.

43:56.240 --> 44:00.800
A lot of things are on my mind actually, but the Epic thing really.

44:00.800 --> 44:01.800
What about the Epic thing?

44:01.800 --> 44:02.800
The whole lawsuit?

44:02.800 --> 44:03.800
Yeah.

44:03.800 --> 44:08.000
Didn't Silicon Knights used to be like a Nintendo company?

44:08.000 --> 44:11.080
Yes, according to Loki.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.080
I don't know.

44:12.080 --> 44:14.200
I haven't checked my Wikipedia.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.200
Is that it?

44:15.200 --> 44:16.200
Yeah.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.200
Silicon Knights did Eternal Darkness.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.200
Oh.

44:18.200 --> 44:23.680
Okay, so what does that have to do with your opinion and everything?

44:23.680 --> 44:26.680
Because now they're doing games for the 360 and PS3.

44:26.680 --> 44:31.600
Do you find that Nintendo cut them loose and now they're doing too human and then they

44:31.600 --> 44:33.880
try to get this engine?

44:33.880 --> 44:39.760
It feels like they're a bunch of... You know how Epic has got this game that's really popular?

44:39.760 --> 44:42.560
I feel like they're just trying to milk money out of them.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.720
A bunch of people go, I can't get this to work.

44:44.720 --> 44:45.720
Damn it.

44:45.720 --> 44:46.720
Let's just sue them.

44:46.720 --> 44:50.640
Well, that's not just the sue part, but as far as the company making games for other

44:50.640 --> 44:53.000
companies, that's what you got to do to make money.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.360
If you don't have an exclusive agreement with one anymore, you make games for wherever you

44:57.360 --> 44:58.680
think you can sell them.

44:58.680 --> 45:04.520
Yeah, and they're trying to make a whole new engine, so I wish them luck with that.

45:04.520 --> 45:06.320
You're getting some agreement from our chat room.

45:06.320 --> 45:09.480
Rob D says, I actually agree with Raven's Dolphin.

45:09.480 --> 45:12.640
Like he's never agreed with you before, so there you go.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.640
That's a first.

45:13.640 --> 45:14.640
That's a first.

45:14.640 --> 45:17.720
All right, and DJ Genai says Epic has a big ego too.

45:17.720 --> 45:22.200
They do, but they do make good games, but it feels like... I'm playing Rainbow Six,

45:22.200 --> 45:26.280
which is an Unreal Tournament game, an Unreal technology game, and it works fine.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.880
I don't know what they're doing.

45:27.880 --> 45:32.160
Sephiroth1215 says they weren't really a Nintendo developer, they just made all the games on

45:32.160 --> 45:33.160
GameCube.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.160
Okay.

45:34.160 --> 45:36.760
All right, well what else is on your mind?

45:36.760 --> 45:38.420
What else is on my mind?

45:38.420 --> 45:43.120
The Wii board, you said that the Wii snowboard... Not the snowboard, the Wii Fit board.

45:43.120 --> 45:45.840
Fit board could be used as a snowboard, I suppose, in a game.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.600
Yeah, this is what I was thinking about.

45:47.600 --> 45:48.600
Remember 1080?

45:48.600 --> 45:49.600
Yeah.

45:49.600 --> 45:56.240
Okay, wouldn't that be the hottest thing if they put 1080 on the Wii Fit board?

45:56.240 --> 46:02.520
Or tricky, SSX tricky, with that theme song I can never get out of my head.

46:02.520 --> 46:03.520
It's tricky.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.520
Yeah.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.160
I can't wait for that.

46:06.160 --> 46:09.120
Blaze agrees with you in chat, 1080 for the win.

46:09.120 --> 46:12.440
So you think they could do more types of games than just fitness games and mini games with

46:12.440 --> 46:13.440
this board?

46:13.440 --> 46:14.440
Snowboarding.

46:14.440 --> 46:15.440
I really do.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.240
Like the next Tony Hawk and the 1080 game, I would cream my pants for that.

46:19.240 --> 46:20.720
I'm a real snowboarding fan.

46:20.720 --> 46:23.520
I don't like sports games, but I love snowboarding games.

46:23.520 --> 46:28.440
How do you think they would do this whole Square Enix is saying they want to license

46:28.440 --> 46:29.560
the thing?

46:29.560 --> 46:33.960
What kind of Square Enix game do you think would incorporate the Wii Fit board?

46:33.960 --> 46:35.160
I've been thinking about it.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.160
I don't know.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.440
It would probably be a Final Fantasy kind of like ripoff game.

46:38.440 --> 46:39.440
I don't know.

46:39.440 --> 46:43.040
I don't think the kind of like Final Fantasy aerobic game going like, yeah, step on the

46:43.040 --> 46:48.720
board, yeah, cast a spell, yeah, do this.

46:48.720 --> 46:54.440
Maybe it would be Final Fantasy X-3 or something where, you know, the Yuna's Angels, you know,

46:54.440 --> 46:57.960
you can actually do a little dance on the Wii Fit board and change into different outfits.

46:57.960 --> 46:58.960
It would be fun.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.960
Doesn't that sound like fun?

47:00.960 --> 47:03.840
That does sound like fun, but I'm really excited, you know.

47:03.840 --> 47:05.960
I'm not going to pass judgment on the board yet.

47:05.960 --> 47:09.320
Well, and you shouldn't until you get to play it, because a lot of people pass judgment

47:09.320 --> 47:11.840
on the Wii, but change their minds when they actually get to play it.

47:11.840 --> 47:13.080
Oh, one last thing.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.040
You don't sound like Vodafin anymore.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.040
Good for you.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.240
I don't sound like what?

47:17.240 --> 47:19.440
You don't sound like you're on Vonage at all.

47:19.440 --> 47:20.880
That might be the new Skype.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.600
I think the quality has increased slightly, so.

47:23.600 --> 47:24.600
What's a Vodge?

47:24.600 --> 47:26.600
Why am I so loud?

47:26.600 --> 47:28.840
A Vodge is what a lady has between...

47:28.840 --> 47:29.840
I thought he said Vodge.

47:29.840 --> 47:30.840
I was like, what the crap?

47:30.840 --> 47:32.840
It doesn't sound like you're on that, I guess.

47:32.840 --> 47:33.840
Vonage.

47:33.840 --> 47:34.840
Vonage.

47:34.840 --> 47:36.560
No, a Vodge is something completely different.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.840
No, I said, I had a D when I said it.

47:38.840 --> 47:39.840
Vodge.

47:39.840 --> 47:40.840
A Vodge is where the babies come from.

47:40.840 --> 47:43.200
And then you shake them.

47:43.200 --> 47:44.200
Stop it.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.200
All right.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.120
I got to go, so you can pick up some more calls.

47:47.120 --> 47:48.120
All right, you got it, Ravis Dolphin.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.120
Talk to you later.

47:49.120 --> 47:51.680
I think I made him uncomfortable.

47:51.680 --> 47:52.680
I think you did.

47:52.680 --> 47:53.680
That was fun.

47:53.680 --> 47:54.680
Let's do it again.

47:54.680 --> 47:55.680
Do it again?

47:55.680 --> 47:56.680
Make him uncomfortable again?

47:56.680 --> 47:58.680
I want to make somebody else uncomfortable.

47:58.680 --> 47:59.680
All right.

47:59.680 --> 48:00.680
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

48:00.680 --> 48:01.680
Who's this?

48:01.680 --> 48:02.880
Hi, GS68.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.800
Hi GS68, what's on your mind?

48:05.800 --> 48:10.360
You know how you said Maximum 2 and 3 will come out along with Long Gun Midnight for

48:10.360 --> 48:11.360
the PS3, right?

48:11.360 --> 48:14.200
I did, and I bet you're calling in to correct me, huh?

48:14.200 --> 48:15.200
Yeah.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.200
All right, what's up?

48:16.200 --> 48:20.960
There's already a few Maximum 2 and 3 machines in Northern California.

48:20.960 --> 48:21.960
Well, that's...

48:21.960 --> 48:26.240
But, okay, so it's not simultaneous, but it's been about the same time, right?

48:26.240 --> 48:28.820
Yeah, there's already a machine in Hayward.

48:28.820 --> 48:29.820
How is it?

48:29.820 --> 48:30.820
I haven't played it yet.

48:30.820 --> 48:33.000
Actually, I haven't tried it yet.

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
I'm just waiting for Sanibel Golf Land and Milpitas Golf Land to get it.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.240
Ah, so some of the local golf lands, sure, and then, you know, it's a big chain.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.680
They get a lot of the hottest games.

48:42.680 --> 48:43.680
Why not?

48:43.680 --> 48:44.680
Yeah, let me just post...

48:44.680 --> 48:46.680
I'm going to post a link in chat room, so...

48:46.680 --> 48:47.680
All right.

48:47.680 --> 48:48.680
Just so you all know.

48:48.680 --> 48:50.400
I am planning on buying it, though.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.400
I think I've decided.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.720
You think you are going to import it?

48:52.720 --> 48:53.720
You know why I checked out first?

48:53.720 --> 48:54.720
Yeah, because...

48:54.720 --> 48:58.000
Well, because I just, you know, I only have like one game for the PS3 now, and it'd be

48:58.000 --> 48:59.240
cool to have an import game.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.240
Yeah, it might be fun.

49:00.240 --> 49:03.400
Although, it's not going to be fun if you buy the thing, and then the damn thing doesn't

49:03.400 --> 49:04.400
work.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.400
That's going to suck.

49:05.400 --> 49:06.400
It's region-free.

49:06.400 --> 49:07.400
All right.

49:07.400 --> 49:08.400
All the games are region-free now.

49:08.400 --> 49:09.400
Can I come over and play?

49:09.400 --> 49:10.400
Yeah.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.400
Tell him no.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.040
GS68, do you know if the soundtrack on the third one is as cool as the second one?

49:13.040 --> 49:14.760
Like, did Yuzo Koshiro do it again?

49:14.760 --> 49:20.180
I don't know yet, but from what I've read, you pick between the Maximum 2 1 and 2 soundtrack

49:20.180 --> 49:26.920
and the new Maximum 2 and 3 soundtrack, and then if you transfer a certain kind of card,

49:26.920 --> 49:32.800
you can get a special soundtrack that's from an earlier Wongdon Midnight game.

49:32.800 --> 49:33.800
That's cool.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.680
Now, I just got disconnected from chat, so I missed your link.

49:35.680 --> 49:36.680
Post it again.

49:36.680 --> 49:37.680
Stupid chat.

49:37.680 --> 49:45.280
Actually, someone just said that you have to register to see it.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.240
It's one of those forums where you have to register to see any...

49:47.240 --> 49:50.240
Give out your registration information.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.560
Is it on bug me not?

49:51.560 --> 49:52.560
All right.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.120
No, it's fine.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.480
I'll wait for the information to hit Wikipedia.

49:56.480 --> 49:57.480
It's all good.

49:57.480 --> 49:58.480
Okay.

49:58.480 --> 49:59.480
All right.

49:59.480 --> 50:00.480
Well, thanks for the correction.

50:00.480 --> 50:01.480
Appreciate it.

50:01.480 --> 50:02.480
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

50:02.480 --> 50:03.480
No, I'm good.

50:03.480 --> 50:04.480
All right.

50:04.480 --> 50:05.480
All right.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.480
Well, then we'll talk to you later, my friend.

50:07.480 --> 50:08.480
All right.

50:08.480 --> 50:09.480
Take care.

50:09.480 --> 50:10.480
All right.

50:10.480 --> 50:11.480
You too.

50:11.480 --> 50:12.480
Bye-bye.

50:12.480 --> 50:13.480
All right.

50:13.480 --> 50:14.480
We'll go back to the phones.

50:14.480 --> 50:20.520
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,

50:20.520 --> 50:22.600
and hopefully we can actually answer the calls tonight.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.620
Again, we've upgraded to a new version of Skype, and it's taken a little bit of getting

50:25.620 --> 50:26.620
used to.

50:26.620 --> 50:28.360
I want these little floating windows to go away.

50:28.360 --> 50:29.360
I don't like that.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.200
Those need to go away.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.200
Shake them.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.200
Maybe it'll work.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.200
Stop it.

50:34.200 --> 50:35.200
Why am I so loud?

50:35.200 --> 50:36.200
I don't know.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.200
Hi.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.200
Oh, snap.

50:38.200 --> 50:39.200
Hello.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.200
Oh, snap.

50:40.200 --> 50:41.200
Hi.

50:41.200 --> 50:42.200
Hi.

50:42.200 --> 50:43.200
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

50:43.200 --> 50:44.200
Who's this?

50:44.200 --> 50:45.200
Legend of Zaku.

50:45.200 --> 50:46.200
Hi, Legend of Zaku.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.200
What's on your mind?

50:47.200 --> 50:48.200
Nah, nothing much.

50:48.200 --> 50:49.200
Just trying to chill this weekend.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.040
Just going through the trauma of DDR Freak, but that's another story.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.320
Wait, the trauma of DDR Freak?

50:54.320 --> 50:55.600
Drama, I said.

50:55.600 --> 50:56.600
The drama.

50:56.600 --> 50:57.600
What else is new?

50:57.600 --> 50:58.600
Why haven't you left?

50:58.600 --> 50:59.600
Why do you think I only moderate two forums?

50:59.600 --> 51:01.720
No, it has nothing to do with the general populace.

51:01.720 --> 51:07.240
It's just within our city and digital life this year.

51:07.240 --> 51:08.240
We like drama.

51:08.240 --> 51:10.920
What's up with digital life this year?

51:10.920 --> 51:22.840
The rules, basically how folks are chastising, they're just having arguments over the rules

51:22.840 --> 51:27.720
this year instead of having a point system for every mod, they actually got adapted two

51:27.720 --> 51:29.980
out of three, straight perfect attack.

51:29.980 --> 51:33.720
I'm just going to ask you straight up, are the rules bullshit this year, Zaku?

51:33.720 --> 51:34.720
Not really.

51:34.720 --> 51:35.720
They're straight four.

51:35.720 --> 51:42.600
As I said, straight PA match, two out of three shuffle I believe will be on at all times

51:42.600 --> 51:48.920
with left and right, but yeah, it's a far cry from last year's challenge point system

51:48.920 --> 51:52.000
where every mod they used would just get you extra points.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.340
When is digital life this year?

51:54.340 --> 51:55.480
At the end of September.

51:55.480 --> 51:58.080
You know I have a credit with JetBlue, I might be able to come back.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.080
Oh really?

51:59.080 --> 52:03.440
Yes, something happened with JetBlue last time I have a credit.

52:03.440 --> 52:05.760
27th through 30th.

52:05.760 --> 52:09.800
Thinking about it, because I know I'd have a place to stay if I went, so we'll see.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.680
No, that's cool.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.720
Think about it.

52:13.720 --> 52:14.720
You already know Don, right?

52:14.720 --> 52:15.720
You know frequency.

52:15.720 --> 52:16.720
Yep.

52:16.720 --> 52:21.680
Let him know, since he's running the tournament, he might be able to hook you up with space

52:21.680 --> 52:27.560
within the booth, perhaps, so he can set up his solo.

52:27.560 --> 52:31.800
I will give it some serious consideration after I get past this move stuff.

52:31.800 --> 52:33.160
I would love to go to digital life.

52:33.160 --> 52:36.540
I keep hearing about it and I never get to go, so maybe.

52:36.540 --> 52:39.560
Hopefully this year will be better than last.

52:39.560 --> 52:46.200
Besides all the drama, these new rules hopefully, from what I've been hearing, will draw most

52:46.200 --> 52:49.920
of the good players from the country.

52:49.920 --> 52:50.920
What is he giving away?

52:50.920 --> 52:51.920
He's giving away a big prize.

52:51.920 --> 52:52.920
He's giving away the DDR tournament this year.

52:52.920 --> 52:53.920
Three grand.

52:53.920 --> 52:54.920
Huh?

52:54.920 --> 52:55.920
Three grand for expert division.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.920
Shit.

52:56.920 --> 52:57.920
Three grand?

52:57.920 --> 52:58.920
I might want to enter that.

52:58.920 --> 52:59.920
My God.

52:59.920 --> 53:00.920
And I think 1,500 for freestyle.

53:00.920 --> 53:01.920
Oh my God.

53:01.920 --> 53:02.920
1,500 bucks for freestyle?

53:02.920 --> 53:04.520
You know the price is regular.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.160
You could totally get a new PS3 with that, and that's it.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.720
I could pay off some credit card bills with that.

53:10.720 --> 53:11.720
Come on.

53:11.720 --> 53:12.720
What are you talking about?

53:12.720 --> 53:13.720
That's great.

53:13.720 --> 53:14.720
I'll have to think about that.

53:14.720 --> 53:15.720
Maybe I should come up with a new freestyle.

53:15.720 --> 53:21.720
Wouldn't you like to see my freestyle, Zaku?

53:21.720 --> 53:22.720
I don't know.

53:22.720 --> 53:23.720
I'm trying to think right now.

53:23.720 --> 53:29.640
I do want to do a routine this year, but I might be looking for another for a partner

53:29.640 --> 53:33.120
maybe, and I want to do a solo, like last year where I fucked it up.

53:33.120 --> 53:34.120
I'll think about it.

53:34.120 --> 53:35.120
You know what?

53:35.120 --> 53:37.880
I'll give Dr. Dick a call and see if he wants to do a freestyle for 1,500 because that might

53:37.880 --> 53:38.880
bring him out of hiding.

53:38.880 --> 53:44.120
Oh yeah, and then you'll be up against all the other folks from within the city and possibly

53:44.120 --> 53:45.120
the country.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.120
Yeah, we'll see.

53:46.120 --> 53:47.120
All right, Zaku.

53:47.120 --> 53:49.600
Anything else you want to share with the listeners?

53:49.600 --> 53:56.320
Pretty much just have the rant about certain stores just jacking up the prices on old school

53:56.320 --> 53:57.320
stuff.

53:57.320 --> 54:03.000
Like the store in the Village that I know, they have the gold to mark up $40 for a copy

54:03.000 --> 54:06.720
of Punch Out, Mike Tyson's Punch Out.

54:06.720 --> 54:10.400
I wonder if that's that same store I got taken to because they had some really expensive

54:10.400 --> 54:11.400
stuff.

54:11.400 --> 54:12.400
Yeah, that's Video Games New York.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.400
Yeah.

54:13.400 --> 54:19.800
But the thing is that I managed to find a $15 copy in a flea market in Coney Island.

54:19.800 --> 54:21.100
It's all about where you look.

54:21.100 --> 54:22.100
It's all about looking.

54:22.100 --> 54:23.100
That type of stuff.

54:23.100 --> 54:24.100
I know.

54:24.100 --> 54:25.100
I could probably go to the farmer's market here and get similar deals.

54:25.100 --> 54:26.100
All right, Zaku.

54:26.100 --> 54:27.100
We've got to let you go.

54:27.100 --> 54:28.100
But have a good one, okay?

54:28.100 --> 54:29.100
All right.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.100
And maybe see you at Digital Life.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.100
Maybe.

54:31.100 --> 54:32.100
All right.

54:32.100 --> 54:33.100
We'll look forward to that.

54:33.100 --> 54:34.100
I hope so.

54:34.100 --> 54:35.100
We'll see you.

54:35.100 --> 54:36.100
Bye.

54:36.100 --> 54:37.100
Peace.

54:37.100 --> 54:38.100
Now I'm really tempted to go because you all know I love New York City and I do have

54:38.100 --> 54:40.720
a credit on JetBlue I have to use within a year.

54:40.720 --> 54:41.720
So maybe.

54:41.720 --> 54:43.720
Ooh, I'm so tempted.

54:43.720 --> 54:44.720
We'll see.

54:44.720 --> 54:45.720
Let's see if we get any more calls.

54:45.720 --> 54:50.480
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE RADIO but the phones haven't

54:50.480 --> 54:51.480
been ringing that much tonight.

54:51.480 --> 54:52.840
I guess you all don't have much to say.

54:52.840 --> 54:56.440
I guess we'll go around and ask if there's any last minute stories.

54:56.440 --> 54:57.440
No.

54:57.440 --> 54:58.440
No?

54:58.440 --> 55:00.720
Loki, you have anything tonight?

55:00.720 --> 55:01.920
Yeah.

55:01.920 --> 55:09.040
As I mentioned earlier, all those rumors from Sony end up becoming true and here's a little

55:09.040 --> 55:14.480
bit of something else we were talking about earlier, how the whole rumbling of the 6-axis

55:14.480 --> 55:18.320
and stuff is coming sooner than later.

55:18.320 --> 55:29.400
Anyways, Kaz Horizon actually admitted that the 6-axis is not the final PlayStation 3

55:29.400 --> 55:30.400
controller.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.400
Surprise.

55:31.400 --> 55:36.560
And that they're working with Immersion on Rumble and there's also rumors I guess

55:36.560 --> 55:44.200
about Immersion's touch-sensitive technology which might be touch-sensitive stuff.

55:44.200 --> 55:46.320
Goodie.

55:46.320 --> 55:47.760
Other interesting things.

55:47.760 --> 55:51.040
Let's see here.

55:51.040 --> 55:57.560
There's a DOA toy that you can buy out there now that you can actually remove the clothing

55:57.560 --> 55:58.840
off of.

55:58.840 --> 56:00.680
Oh, hooray.

56:00.680 --> 56:04.660
As if you need an excuse to buy those.

56:04.660 --> 56:05.660
Let's see.

56:05.660 --> 56:14.120
Now, you may remember Sonic and Mario at the Olympics is going to come out later this year.

56:14.120 --> 56:17.460
Also though, that's not the only Olympics games being released.

56:17.460 --> 56:22.040
In the UK, Asterix at the Olympics is also going to be making its way out there.

56:22.040 --> 56:26.800
So that should be pretty interesting.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.920
And then this one also looks very interesting to me.

56:29.920 --> 56:38.320
The DJ Maxx developers are announcing a brand new PSP shooter game called S4 Portable.

56:38.320 --> 56:45.120
And no word on, it's a stylish shooting sports game I guess.

56:45.120 --> 56:49.840
And it's also going to feature some of the characters from DJ Maxx in it as well.

56:49.840 --> 56:50.840
So that's pretty awesome.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.960
Come on and be Rangers.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.680
They're so cool.

56:55.680 --> 57:02.600
Another thing, Project Anthem Racing 4 actually has the ability to save every single race

57:02.600 --> 57:03.800
that everybody does.

57:03.800 --> 57:07.760
They're actually going to have a database online where you can upload every single race

57:07.760 --> 57:08.760
you race.

57:08.760 --> 57:11.560
Is that like what they do for Halo?

57:11.560 --> 57:13.760
Possibly.

57:13.760 --> 57:17.120
Very interesting.

57:17.120 --> 57:19.120
Quick comments from chatroom on these various stories.

57:19.120 --> 57:23.200
GS68 agrees the NB Rangers are awesome.

57:23.200 --> 57:25.920
So GS68 wants to know about the Dead or Alive figures.

57:25.920 --> 57:27.440
Does it have jiggleable boobs?

57:27.440 --> 57:30.200
No, it doesn't really make them fully naked.

57:30.200 --> 57:33.300
You can just take them down the broad in panties I guess.

57:33.300 --> 57:34.460
This is interesting.

57:34.460 --> 57:40.740
Next week we're going to get Wing Commander Arena on Xbox Live Arcade for 800 points.

57:40.740 --> 57:41.740
Not interested.

57:41.740 --> 57:42.740
Sorry.

57:42.740 --> 57:44.160
I used to love Wing Commander.

57:44.160 --> 57:49.180
If it was original Wing Commander I'd be sold.

57:49.180 --> 57:51.020
And this I'd like to plug real quick.

57:51.020 --> 57:57.880
It's a PSP IRC version 1.01 and it's an IRC client for the PSP.

57:57.880 --> 58:02.040
In fact, earlier today I was using it in the chatroom and it works pretty good.

58:02.040 --> 58:08.240
It works on a firmware 1.5 as well as those custom firmwares out there.

58:08.240 --> 58:09.320
So check it out.

58:09.320 --> 58:13.640
It does support an IR keyboard as well if you happen to have one of those.

58:13.640 --> 58:15.000
I didn't.

58:15.000 --> 58:19.160
But they apparently have tested it with the Targis universal IR wireless keyboard.

58:19.160 --> 58:22.200
I guess it's used for PDAs.

58:22.200 --> 58:25.720
But if you don't have that there's another text entry method that's a little bit slower

58:25.720 --> 58:27.000
but still you can do it.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.900
It's pretty easy.

58:29.900 --> 58:36.760
And then real quick, there's an interesting rumor going around that Manhunt 2 might be

58:36.760 --> 58:44.560
published by Nintendo or published for the Nintendo Wii despite the AO rating.

58:44.560 --> 58:50.560
It's coming from gonintendo.com but no word if that's been confirmed yet or not.

58:50.560 --> 58:54.600
Well I have one last minute story that was sent to me from Tigerclaw in chat and it's

58:54.600 --> 59:00.840
a story that comes from gizmodo.com and it has to do with how a gang of folks actually

59:00.840 --> 59:07.040
kidnapped a gamer to get his password using a date request on Orkut.

59:07.040 --> 59:08.960
This is crazy.

59:08.960 --> 59:10.740
This again is coming from gizmodo.com.

59:10.740 --> 59:14.560
An armed gang of four kidnapped one of the world's top RPG gamers after one criminal's

59:14.560 --> 59:17.740
girlfriend lured him into a fake date using Orkut.

59:17.740 --> 59:19.560
That's Google's social network by the way.

59:19.560 --> 59:23.680
After sequestering him in Sao Paulo they held a gun against the victim's head for five hours

59:23.680 --> 59:27.820
to get his password which they wanted to sell for $8,000.

59:27.820 --> 59:30.200
After five hours the hostage wasn't talking.

59:30.200 --> 59:33.720
The group leader had a gun against his head at all that time but the guy didn't say a

59:33.720 --> 59:34.720
word.

59:34.720 --> 59:36.400
Finally the crooks gave up and decided to let him go.

59:36.400 --> 59:40.200
The Brazilian police then caught the four suspects aged 19, 27.

59:40.200 --> 59:45.480
According to police the captive was the world leader in Gunbound is who they kidnapped.

59:45.480 --> 59:49.320
That was the world leader in Gunbound and of course you guys probably know about this

59:49.320 --> 59:50.320
game.

59:50.320 --> 59:51.320
You've probably heard of it.

59:51.320 --> 59:55.200
Have some friends that play it and so this guy's like the world leader and so the game

59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.480
is so popular these gangsters decided to make some quick money off of it by sending him

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:04.480
an online date through Orkut and then kidnapping him instead.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480
Crazy.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.820
There you go.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.320
I like how they gave up.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.320
I know.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320
It's kind of interesting.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320
Eh, forget it.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.320
Wow.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:19.480
GS68 says gold farming is serious fucking business.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.040
Frisbee says tell me your fucking password.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.000
That must have been a very interesting conversation.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.520
That would be like an interesting movie plot.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.880
GS68 says I should start on Gunbound.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.560
Why would that story make you want to start playing Gunbound?

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.560
Ugh.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.560
Alright.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:38.560
Well, that's going to do it with the Skype line, I wasn't really ringing in any more

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560
calls.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.880
So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight and to do that we have to go around

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.000
and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.600
Miklotov, thank you so much for being here this week.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.120
I stayed through the whole thing.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120
You really did.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.120
I'm very impressed.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.120
That's the first time in months.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.000
And now you're not going to catch your train to go home.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
It's 834.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Gosh dang it.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
It's alright.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.480
Can I do an FUs real quick?

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.480
No.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.480
Dang it.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.480
Alright, but thank you for being here.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.480
You're welcome.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.600
Thank you for making me lose money.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.600
Sorry.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.720
Any final thoughts?

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.420
I love Survivor a lot.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.800
You're so going to get voted out.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.800
I don't care.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.800
I'm having fun.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.800
Alright.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.160
Loki, your final thought?

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.160
I don't know.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.360
I kind of want to play this Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 3 game.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.360
Looks fun.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360
It better be fun.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.360
It's expensive.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360
Alright.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:37.000
And, Jamie, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.320
Uh, what?

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.600
That's your final thought is what?

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600
What?

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.600
What?

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600
What?

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600
Alright.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.360
Do they speak English and what?

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:54.920
And I also have a final thought for tonight.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.800
My vote tonight is for Shane.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.800
What?

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.040
Shane, you're a real fucking duplicitous asshole and you were plotting against me in the very

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.880
beginning of this game.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.560
That you must leave the island tonight.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.560
Whatever.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.560
I win.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.560
Take that.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.560
Alright.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:16.320
Anyway, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.280
and independent internet radio.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.180
Of course, without your support, we would never be here in the first place, so thank

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.180
you very much.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.180
