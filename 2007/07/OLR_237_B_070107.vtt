Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:05.700 --> 00:11.700
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

00:11.700 --> 00:15.000
for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.500 --> 00:24.900
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, July the 1st of 2007.

00:24.900 --> 00:29.300
If you haven't heard part A of our program yet, go back to wherever you got this episode,

00:29.300 --> 00:33.500
whether it be iTunes or Digg or wherever you got this, and look for part A

00:33.500 --> 00:36.100
because Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two parts every week.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.900
It's the little announce in the beginning of the show told you.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.100
So why am I repeating myself? I don't know.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.900
So let's get back to the gaming news.

00:42.900 --> 00:47.800
There's an interesting little blog post I've seen pop up on Engadget

00:47.800 --> 00:54.700
showing someone that's modded a Wii remote with a Zapper gun from the Nintendo Entertainment System.

00:54.700 --> 00:58.500
Now what they've done with this, and you might be wondering why the hell would they do this,

00:58.500 --> 01:03.600
is they've actually kind of repositioned the IR sensor that's in the front of the Wii remote

01:03.600 --> 01:05.300
to the front of the Zapper gun.

01:05.300 --> 01:10.300
And of course the trigger on the Zapper gun is now the B button for the Wii remote.

01:10.300 --> 01:15.800
So I guess you could actually use that sort of as, you know, a first person shooter controller

01:15.800 --> 01:18.500
or something kind of like that.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.000
Pretty neat, I don't know.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Better than some of the stuff that's out there right now, that's for sure.

01:24.000 --> 01:24.900
Huh.

01:24.900 --> 01:28.600
Where's Duck Hunt on Virtual Console already?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.500
So we can really get some use out of this.

01:30.500 --> 01:34.600
I think Duck Hunt's going to be a little harder because a lot of those gun games now

01:34.600 --> 01:36.100
it's not going to be a straight port over.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.600
They've got to rebuild the whole thing for the Wii remote.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.100
Oh, I guess that's kind of true, huh?

01:40.100 --> 01:43.700
You can't, well can't, I mean, because basically these games run off of emulators anyway,

01:43.700 --> 01:49.800
so can't the Wii remote kind of emulate a light gun in the same way that some Nintendo emulators let you use your mouse?

01:49.800 --> 01:56.000
Um, I suppose, but you know, obviously the people that make the emulators aren't exactly the people that work for Nintendo either.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.500
Well then again, maybe if the rumors are true about this whole Dr. Mario Wii thing

01:59.500 --> 02:03.800
and the fact that the Dr. Mario is actually a new game being made for the Wii,

02:03.800 --> 02:06.200
or, well I guess you shouldn't say a new game, but you know what I mean,

02:06.200 --> 02:09.500
like it's something you haven't seen before, a redone version of it,

02:09.500 --> 02:12.300
um, maybe Duck Hunt can get something similar.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.100
I hope so, because I like, uh...

02:14.100 --> 02:18.100
I guess you kind of saw that in Wii Play a little bit in that one game.

02:18.100 --> 02:23.000
I would like me some Battle Clash, and some Super Scope 6 stuff.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.200
Good times.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.400
Alright, uh, the doctor in chat says,

02:26.400 --> 02:29.300
I want some awesome 3D Duck Hunt.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.500
That could be kind of interesting.

02:31.500 --> 02:35.000
Shadow Charlie says, but isn't there supposed to be a Zapper adapter coming soon?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.800
There is something that's officially going to come out at some point pretty soon.

02:38.800 --> 02:43.200
I imagine that, um, you know, because they were showing stuff at E3 last year

02:43.200 --> 02:47.500
that looked like a shotgun kind of attachment, obviously that was, you know, more of a prototype.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.800
I, you know, we might see something at E3.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.100
I mean, that's when they drop bombs like that, you know,

02:53.100 --> 02:54.800
hey, this is going to be coming out soon.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.100
I still say, if this Dr. Mario Wii thing is true,

02:57.100 --> 02:58.800
I think you're going to see it at E3 week.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.900
I think that would be a nice little bombshell, you know, that whole little like,

03:01.900 --> 03:04.700
you know, now especially that you have the downloadable content, you know,

03:04.700 --> 03:06.300
and all that to push things,

03:06.300 --> 03:08.000
I think you're going to see that really used this year,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.100
because Xbox did it last year in a great way, and, you know,

03:10.100 --> 03:13.500
I think, uh, Wii and Sony are hopefully going to do it as well.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.400
Anyhow, uh, moving on to other Nintendo related things,

03:16.400 --> 03:18.600
a lot of folks are very excited about Contra IV.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.600
Have you seen some of the videos?

03:19.600 --> 03:20.300
Mm-hmm.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.000
Looks pretty hot.

03:21.000 --> 03:21.500
Oh, yeah.

03:21.500 --> 03:25.200
I mean, it's just, it's like, okay, good, you kept what worked,

03:25.200 --> 03:28.900
and that's just, you know, Contra, and just made a new Contra game on the DS.

03:28.900 --> 03:29.900
Looks great.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.300
They just don't need to mess with it anymore.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.300
This is how you do it.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.600
Well, just like Castlevania.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.400
Well, hopefully the game will sound great too,

03:37.400 --> 03:40.300
and, uh, it's all going to be in the hands of Vert.

03:40.300 --> 03:44.400
Vert, also known as Jake Kaufman, will be the composer for Contra IV.

03:44.400 --> 03:51.100
Now, the reason why this is kind of cool is because Vert also founded the video game remix site, VGMix.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.700
So, it's kind of interesting that he's crossing over, so to speak, with a, quote-unquote,

03:54.700 --> 03:58.700
legit game, if you want to say, and he's actually going to be composing for Contra IV.

03:58.700 --> 03:59.300
Pretty rad.

03:59.300 --> 04:02.400
But, from what I hear, though, is he's done some legitimate games before.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.100
He did, um, some games actually by the developer that's making this game,

04:06.100 --> 04:10.100
because they did some other games on the DS, and he's done some music for them, original stuff.

04:10.100 --> 04:14.600
This is like a really high, you know, very highly anticipated A-list title, so to speak.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.100
Oh yeah.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.100
So, that's pretty cool.

04:16.100 --> 04:20.100
Um, but not the first time the Konami has gone to the internet to find musicians.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.100
Of course, if you follow the DDR series,

04:22.100 --> 04:28.100
the UltraMix and Universe series have previously had a competition to put indie artists in the game.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.100
Yes.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.100
Um, another thing that people might be looking for,

04:32.100 --> 04:36.100
I mean, granted, the classic controller is pretty good for fighting games,

04:36.100 --> 04:40.100
but, you know, when you're looking for something just a little bit better and a little bit more like the arcade,

04:40.100 --> 04:43.100
uh, well, you might be turning to a company like HORI,

04:43.100 --> 04:47.100
and they're actually going to be releasing a fighting stick for the Wii,

04:47.100 --> 04:52.100
which I imagine would be kind of hooking up to the Wii Remote, very similar to, like, the classic controller.

04:52.100 --> 04:56.100
But, I mean, this is everything that you could possibly want in an arcade stick.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.100
Um, it looks awesome.

04:58.100 --> 05:05.100
Perfect for, you know, Street Fighter II Turbo, or, uh, of course, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.100
I was going to say, all those original Wii fighting games that the Wii doesn't have right now.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.100
I mean, they'll have Guilty Gear soon, but, you know.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.100
Well, virtual console stuff, and this will also be good for, like, arcade games and stuff.

05:13.100 --> 05:17.100
Hey, you know what, you don't necessarily, not a lot of people really pick up these arcade sticks.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.100
It's, you know, the people that really are into their hardcore.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.100
Fucking hardcore.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.100
You know, games like that, so.

05:22.100 --> 05:27.100
Can I use it, uh, backwards compatible with GameCube, like, for Soul Calibur action?

05:27.100 --> 05:35.100
Uh, probably not, because, you know, this is going to be hooking up via, you know, the expansion port on the Wii Remote.

05:35.100 --> 05:40.100
So, since you can't use the Wii Remote or classic controller on GameCube games, you're out of luck.

05:40.100 --> 05:49.100
And you probably wouldn't be able to anyways, because, I mean, there's really only one, you know, directional button, or directional joystick on there, and eight buttons.

05:49.100 --> 05:55.100
So, you wouldn't have all the analog sticks and stuff that the GameCube would have.

05:55.100 --> 05:58.100
Oh, well.

05:58.100 --> 06:01.100
Sorry, I was just responding to some comments in chat there.

06:01.100 --> 06:04.100
Somebody who just joined, who hasn't changed their nickname yet, says,

06:04.100 --> 06:08.100
Why can't the PSP get Contra IV? Why didn't Contra IV go to the PSP?

06:08.100 --> 06:11.100
And Rama responded, because the PSP sucks ass.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.100
And I was like, play FF1.

06:14.100 --> 06:21.100
It doesn't suck ass, but I think that this game, you know, would work pretty good on the DS.

06:21.100 --> 06:26.100
I mean, after all, Contra, you know, the first three Contra games were on, you know, the Nintendo system.

06:26.100 --> 06:33.100
So, only fitting that, you know, Contra IV come to the DS.

06:33.100 --> 06:39.100
Well, one game that may not be coming out for the DS much longer, no, just kidding, these games sell like hotcakes,

06:39.100 --> 06:44.100
but there was a brain game called Mind Quiz that came out for the Nintendo DS.

06:44.100 --> 06:50.100
And the BBC is reporting that the game is actually being pulled by the manufacturer.

06:50.100 --> 06:58.100
It was released by Ubisoft, and somebody got their panties in a bunch over a derogatory term that was used in the game.

06:58.100 --> 07:04.100
Now, the BBC article never names the term by name, but I think I speculate I figured out what it is here.

07:04.100 --> 07:09.100
But basically what happened, let's see, a Belfast woman actually called the BBC

07:09.100 --> 07:15.100
and talked to Radio Astur's Nolan show, and actually said here,

07:15.100 --> 07:21.100
quote, I thought it was absolutely appalling that a word like this should be used to describe someone who has not achieved very well.

07:21.100 --> 07:25.100
Apparently, she was playing this game in the hospital right after she gave birth to her son,

07:25.100 --> 07:30.100
and I guess she didn't do so well in one stage, and the game called her a derogatory name.

07:30.100 --> 07:36.100
The three-year-old, by the way, to put this in perspective, her three-year-old suffered from cerebral palsy

07:36.100 --> 07:41.100
and was also severely brain damaged, so she was kind of, that's not funny, why are you laughing?

07:41.100 --> 07:46.100
No, I'm just thinking of what the word was, you know, not the situation, that's really sad.

07:46.100 --> 07:51.100
Yeah, I know, and the lady was very shocked because she performed poorly in this one stage,

07:51.100 --> 07:57.100
and the game called her, quote, it raided her efforts in a manner derogatory to the disabled.

07:57.100 --> 08:01.100
So I'm thinking the word is retarded? I guess?

08:01.100 --> 08:05.100
Which, you know, is a word, I'll admit, we do it here on the program,

08:05.100 --> 08:09.100
a lot of, you know, we throw that word around sometimes and not really think about what it really means.

08:09.100 --> 08:17.100
Well, you have to understand that we, I mean, the word retard means to slow or, you know, to, I guess,

08:17.100 --> 08:21.100
I don't know, basically slow, you know, retarding something.

08:21.100 --> 08:28.100
You know, retard your anger, you know, that was in anger management.

08:28.100 --> 08:34.100
That's what I'm going to tell the Loki next time the subject of Apple comes up, retard your anger.

08:34.100 --> 08:37.100
No, but seriously, in music you use that term.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.100
That's how you use the word. It's unfortunate, it's just like, you know, what is it, fag.

08:41.100 --> 08:48.100
You know, people, it is, you know, to describe a cigarette and stuff, but it's, you know, slang in the UK,

08:48.100 --> 08:52.100
but over here, you know, we use it as, you know, what I get called.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.100
Yeah.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.100
Yes, exactly.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.100
Fag your anger, Rob.

08:57.100 --> 09:00.100
Well, anyway, I really don't know what to think about this.

09:00.100 --> 09:04.100
I mean, on one hand I'm like, oh, this person's overreacting and ruining the fun for the rest of us,

09:04.100 --> 09:07.100
but at the same time you kind of go, well...

09:07.100 --> 09:10.100
Why did you buy a brain training game like that?

09:10.100 --> 09:12.100
But I don't know, I don't know what to think.

09:12.100 --> 09:18.100
I'm really looking for chatroom comments on this to see what you guys think of this story here,

09:18.100 --> 09:19.100
because I don't know what to think.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.100
I don't know if she's being too sensitive.

09:21.100 --> 09:26.100
I don't know if, you know, maybe it is appropriate.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.100
I think mine was by Ubisoft, so shame on them.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.100
What do you think, Rice Princess?

09:31.100 --> 09:34.100
Do you have an opinion on this?

09:34.100 --> 09:36.100
Because you haven't really been talking the rest of the show otherwise,

09:36.100 --> 09:38.100
so I'm trying to encourage you to participate.

09:38.100 --> 09:42.100
Yeah, I'm totally looking at my life journal.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.100
I don't know, it really depends on what the word actually is.

09:44.100 --> 09:47.100
I just think that they should have included that in the article.

09:47.100 --> 09:53.100
Otherwise, it could be something like, you know, I don't know, farty butt or something, you know, being the actual word.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.100
I've never heard a farty butt.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.100
You're so dumb.

09:55.100 --> 09:56.100
Oh!

09:56.100 --> 10:00.100
I've never heard a farty butt be used for a derogatory term that is disabled.

10:00.100 --> 10:07.100
I personally think it's the word Cali from Battlestar Galactica, because she's retarded.

10:07.100 --> 10:11.100
But you use that word in a derogatory manner.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.100
I do, don't I?

10:12.100 --> 10:13.100
I do, I do.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.100
That's not nice.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.100
It isn't nice at all.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.100
Let's see.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.100
I'm not a nice person.

10:17.100 --> 10:20.100
Looking at chat room, Wonder Dog Harold says,

10:20.100 --> 10:23.100
Heaven forbid the lady plays a You Don't Know Jack game and gets insulted.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.100
Rama says, You guys are a bunch of fags.

10:25.100 --> 10:31.100
Ross Steel UT says, A derogatory term for the disabled has no place in a brain training game.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.100
Dark Knight says, It's the French.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.100
You know, Ubisoft.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.100
Girl Bakura says, Something with the word spastic.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.100
Maybe like a spaz or a, I don't know, maybe could be the word there.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.100
Let's see.

10:45.100 --> 10:48.100
Azurame says, I think she is right.

10:48.100 --> 10:52.100
I work in the mental field and they could get in some serious trouble if told to the right people.

10:52.100 --> 10:57.100
Rama also says, Whatever happened to sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.

10:57.100 --> 10:59.100
Interesting.

10:59.100 --> 11:02.100
So there you go.

11:02.100 --> 11:06.100
And ACHP says, The word was spastic.

11:06.100 --> 11:12.100
So maybe, that isn't, like I would, is spastic really that bad?

11:12.100 --> 11:14.100
Have I just been ignorant all these years?

11:14.100 --> 11:15.100
Ignant?

11:15.100 --> 11:16.100
Why are you so ignorant?

11:16.100 --> 11:18.100
I don't know.

11:18.100 --> 11:21.100
Spastic I don't think is a bad term.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.100
I don't know.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.100
That's stupid.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.100
She's spastic.

11:26.100 --> 11:28.100
Fucking spaz.

11:28.100 --> 11:37.100
This frustration leaves me with no other choice but to bring on one of our very favorite segments because I'm just left confused and unsure with what else to do at this point.

11:37.100 --> 12:02.100
Music.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.100
Alright, Loki start us off tonight.

12:04.100 --> 12:08.100
Fuck you to the state of California.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.100
And why?

12:09.100 --> 12:18.100
Because driving on our local Highway 50 over here, it was nice to see that they've repaved the freeway.

12:18.100 --> 12:22.100
The only problem is they forgot to paint lines on the freeway.

12:22.100 --> 12:29.100
So there's this four lane highway that all of a sudden becomes one lane because there's no lines on it.

12:29.100 --> 12:31.100
Makes it a little unsafe.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.100
Just a little.

12:32.100 --> 12:36.100
Especially when cars are like, well, I don't know where the lane ends.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.100
So that's kind of bad.

12:38.100 --> 12:43.100
Kind of something you should have, I don't know, done before you finish your project here.

12:43.100 --> 12:47.100
At least put something that indicates where the lane ends and begins.

12:47.100 --> 12:52.100
So fuck them because I know someone is going to get injured and hopefully sue for a lot of money.

12:52.100 --> 13:02.100
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I just put in my notice I'm going to move on August 1st today and I have no place to live lined up just yet so I'll be hitting Craigslist all next week.

13:02.100 --> 13:05.100
Or it might be an OLR live from your house.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.100
A contest from the listeners because I'll be homeless.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.100
Wow.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.100
Pretty sad.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.100
Yeah.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.100
Rice versus.

13:11.100 --> 13:14.100
FU to the weather because it's way too fucking hot.

13:14.100 --> 13:19.100
And I don't have an air conditioner in my car because I'm po.

13:19.100 --> 13:22.100
And I can't afford a luxury car.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.100
And that's pretty much it.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.100
Yeah.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.100
I'm sorry too.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.100
Anyhow, what are you giggling at over there, Logie?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.100
Shadow's liar.

13:31.100 --> 13:37.100
Fag your anger, Logie.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.100
Man, that's like the best word ever.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.100
If anybody hasn't left a review on iTunes.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.100
Oh, damn it.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.100
They're going to block that word.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.100
You're not going to be able to put fag in a review on iTunes.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.100
No.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.100
Damn, because I was going to say like.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.100
Oh, that's retarded.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.100
Somebody needs to leave.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.100
That's horrible.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.100
I shouldn't lie.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.100
I apologize if you were offended by that and the fact that I laughed at it.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.100
Oh, whatever.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.100
That's your automatic gut reaction.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.100
You don't have to apologize for who you are, Rob.

13:59.100 --> 14:04.180
But I really want to see a review on iTunes that says these guys need to learn how to

14:04.180 --> 14:07.100
fag their anger.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.100
Can someone make that happen?

14:09.100 --> 14:11.100
Get around the word sensor somehow.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.100
Put P-H-A-G or something.

14:13.100 --> 14:17.100
I'll give you the link in iTunes if you want to go leave a review there for our chatters,

14:17.100 --> 14:19.100
because I'm sure there's someone in there that hasn't done it.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.100
Good idea.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.100
Yeah.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.100
There you go.

14:22.100 --> 14:26.100
In sickest or insaneist in the chat says F-H-A-G, fag your anger.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.100
I really want someone in the chat to leave that as an iTunes review.

14:29.100 --> 14:32.100
These guys need to learn how to fag their anger.

14:32.100 --> 14:37.100
Anyways, so guess what?

14:37.100 --> 14:43.100
There's this brand new, well it's not brand new, but a racing series coming back to consoles

14:43.100 --> 14:45.100
exclusively to the Wii.

14:45.100 --> 14:52.100
It's called Cruisin' and it's going to be exclusively coming to the Wii with licensed

14:52.100 --> 14:59.100
cars and whatnot, body kits, upgrades, turbos, all that fun stuff.

14:59.100 --> 15:03.100
So, Cruisin' coming to the Wii.

15:03.100 --> 15:09.100
To be honest, I never was a huge fan of the Cruisin' series.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.100
I always thought them to be kind of cheesy and stupid.

15:12.100 --> 15:16.100
I seem to remember Dark Soccer as a big fan though, so she'll probably be excited about

15:16.100 --> 15:17.100
this.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.100
I played the games, they were pretty fun.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.100
Did anyone remember Rush?

15:20.100 --> 15:21.100
Yeah.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.100
Rush 2049, San Francisco Rush?

15:23.100 --> 15:29.100
No, I meant the last Rush game that they released that was basically, I don't remember if it

15:29.100 --> 15:35.100
was Rush, I think it was just San Francisco Rush, or they redid it for the PSP and stuff.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.100
It wasn't very good.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.100
Interesting.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.100
So, you think this game might be a disaster as well?

15:41.100 --> 15:42.100
I think it might be.

15:42.100 --> 15:46.100
Just what we needed in this next gen of gaming, or new gen of gaming, whatever you want to

15:46.100 --> 15:48.100
call it, another fucking racing game.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.100
That sucks.

15:49.100 --> 15:53.100
Even if it is a memorable one from years past.

15:53.100 --> 15:57.100
Speaking of years past, if you live over in Europe, you have some new stuff on the Virtual

15:57.100 --> 16:03.100
Console, and a very interesting pair that came out this week, Kirby's Dream Course,

16:03.100 --> 16:05.100
which is actually a game I really enjoyed on the Super Nintendo.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.100
I had that game.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.100
It was a lot of fun.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.100
It's like a little miniature golf game, but you use Kirby.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.100
You like miniature golf games, right, Loki?

16:11.100 --> 16:14.100
You'll have to check this out when it comes stateside.

16:14.100 --> 16:19.100
But the other game was Bloody Wolf, which is a turbo graphics game there.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.100
Bloody Wolf?

16:20.100 --> 16:23.100
No, it's like a war-ish game there on the Turbo Graphics 16.

16:23.100 --> 16:27.100
You get Cutesy, Cutesy Kirby, and Bloody Wolf.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.100
There you go.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.100
Kirby's Bloody Wolf.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.100
What came out in America?

16:31.100 --> 16:32.100
I totally missed it.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.100
Oh, we got the F-Zero, didn't we?

16:33.100 --> 16:34.100
I think so.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.100
I don't know.

16:35.100 --> 16:38.100
I haven't downloaded anything from Virtual Console since Zelda II, right?

16:38.100 --> 16:40.100
Wasn't that just two weeks ago?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.100
It wasn't that long ago.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.100
It seems like a long time ago.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.100
There you go.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.100
Well, some other stuff you're going to be able to download soon.

16:46.100 --> 16:51.100
I don't know why this is a news story, because I always thought this was still on there in

16:51.100 --> 16:53.100
the first place.

16:53.100 --> 16:58.100
Also a reminder, if you haven't downloaded the Internet channel yet, you're now going

16:58.100 --> 16:59.100
to have to pay for it.

16:59.100 --> 17:02.100
So screw you guys, not that it's any good.

17:02.100 --> 17:07.100
Not that we do have a... we don't have an O-L-O-V site, because I never made one.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.100
Because you're lazy.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.100
Because I'm lazy.

17:09.100 --> 17:14.100
But anyways, there's going to be a brand new service coming to have original downloadable

17:14.100 --> 17:15.100
titles called WiiWare.

17:15.100 --> 17:21.100
And if I remember correctly, that's already online with I think the Internet channel,

17:21.100 --> 17:24.100
and also the Wii Vote channel.

17:24.100 --> 17:25.100
It's called WiiWare.

17:25.100 --> 17:28.100
And hypothetically, this is Dr. Mario Wii, right?

17:28.100 --> 17:29.100
Hypothetically.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.100
2 plus 2 equals 4.

17:30.100 --> 17:33.600
This, I'm not sure if it's going to be a brand new channel, but currently online right now

17:33.600 --> 17:35.100
they do have a section for WiiWare.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.800
It's been there forever.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.480
But they just want you to remember that there is going to be a WiiWare service that's going

17:40.480 --> 17:45.580
to be kind of like Xbox Live Arcade or the PlayStation 3 PSN networks.

17:45.580 --> 17:51.180
So I don't know, going to be seeing some original titles, which will be cool.

17:51.180 --> 17:56.260
And I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to find out what exactly is coming there first.

17:56.260 --> 17:59.820
Obviously we're thinking Dr. Mario Wii.

17:59.820 --> 18:02.300
I haven't checked the Everybody Votes channel in weeks.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.900
Did they ever use the question I submitted to them?

18:04.900 --> 18:05.900
I don't know.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.100
The last one I saw was thank you or hello.

18:08.100 --> 18:12.420
No, the question I submitted was which is funnier, clowns or rape?

18:12.420 --> 18:14.700
I don't know if they used that though.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.540
I'm thinking they probably didn't because I probably would have heard something about

18:17.540 --> 18:18.540
it.

18:18.540 --> 18:23.620
They probably would have made the gaming blog news.

18:23.620 --> 18:28.420
Also making the gaming blog news this week is the launch of 3Speech because everybody

18:28.420 --> 18:30.960
and their fucking mom has to have a podcast.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.600
And so Sony started one.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.460
They have the 3Speech podcast.

18:35.460 --> 18:38.060
And what did they do in their first podcast?

18:38.060 --> 18:42.100
It might not have been the first episode, but definitely they're still early on in their

18:42.100 --> 18:43.100
podcasting life.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.660
They've taken a shot at Major Nelson.

18:46.660 --> 18:51.900
What's interesting though is that upon reviews of the new 3Speech podcast, 3Speech doesn't

18:51.900 --> 18:55.860
really let you know that they work for Sony where Major Nelson kind of makes it no secret.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.480
He does work for Microsoft.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.180
But the interesting thing about Major Nelson, he'll say nice things about the Wii once in

19:00.180 --> 19:03.500
a while and even PlayStation 3 if they deserve it.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.620
So there you go.

19:05.620 --> 19:09.820
And sorry, I laughed because I'm reading chat here.

19:09.820 --> 19:16.580
Wonder Dog Herald suggests everybody votes question, which do you prefer, cock or vag?

19:16.580 --> 19:19.300
I'm sure that will get through.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.300
They're dinner meats.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.300
Anyhow.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.300
What the hell?

19:22.300 --> 19:23.300
Oh, they're dinner meats.

19:23.300 --> 19:29.100
Great way to cover that up there.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.100
You know what?

19:30.100 --> 19:31.100
Forget the other story.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.100
It's just a story about Sony making fun of Major Nelson.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.100
Who cares?

19:35.100 --> 19:36.100
Seriously.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.100
Keep talking about that.

19:37.100 --> 19:41.740
I'm seriously reading this going, who cares?

19:41.740 --> 19:44.420
They refer to Major Nelson as the unnamed blogger.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.060
Oh my God!

19:46.060 --> 19:47.060
No!

19:47.060 --> 19:48.260
Why do they say he's unnamed?

19:48.260 --> 19:50.700
He clearly has a name.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.500
Major Nelson.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.660
That is just pure falsity.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.980
That's right.

19:56.980 --> 20:00.780
I made up a word, falsity.

20:00.780 --> 20:01.780
I don't really care.

20:01.780 --> 20:04.460
I've listened to Major Nelson once.

20:04.460 --> 20:05.460
Not that I have anything against the guy.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.660
I just don't have time to listen to him.

20:07.660 --> 20:09.780
The three speech podcast I'll probably never listen to.

20:09.780 --> 20:10.780
So you know what?

20:10.780 --> 20:11.780
You know what?

20:11.780 --> 20:12.780
Listen to this podcast.

20:12.780 --> 20:13.780
This is all you need.

20:13.780 --> 20:19.660
Major spoiler alert here, but I hear that the next three speech podcast calls Leo Laporte's

20:19.660 --> 20:32.480
spastic and then the next one they tell Reggie if he's made of faggot's anger.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.020
This is kind of interesting actually.

20:34.020 --> 20:39.340
We've been seeing a lot of these weird third party adapters and stuff come out for the

20:39.340 --> 20:40.540
360.

20:40.540 --> 20:47.940
This one though is being created by XMN and that's a mod company and they're actually

20:47.940 --> 20:53.900
creating an HDMI cable for the regular non-elite 360s.

20:53.900 --> 20:58.220
No word yet on how exactly it's going to work, but apparently it's going to allow you to

20:58.220 --> 21:06.900
use HDMI cables obviously for 1080p on systems that may not be black and supporting a HDMI

21:06.900 --> 21:07.980
out on it.

21:07.980 --> 21:12.460
So the speculation I believe is that it's going to be something that has to do with

21:12.460 --> 21:17.780
the VGA cable maybe converting the signal over to work on HDMI.

21:17.780 --> 21:22.040
I don't know, but it should be interesting to see.

21:22.040 --> 21:30.260
So if you want to keep an eye on that, check out xcm.cc and they have all the information

21:30.260 --> 21:32.060
on that.

21:32.060 --> 21:36.940
Alright, now why would I want to get an HDMI cable?

21:36.940 --> 21:38.460
Is it really that big a difference?

21:38.460 --> 21:39.940
I don't think it's a big difference.

21:39.940 --> 21:45.900
It's really if you want that kind of cable for your console.

21:45.900 --> 21:52.540
I think they're maybe worried that later on when they start using the broadcast flag and

21:52.540 --> 21:55.780
stuff that you might need an HDMI cable.

21:55.780 --> 21:59.020
Although I would think though if you're using this converter it's not going to work anyways.

21:59.020 --> 22:00.020
I don't know.

22:00.020 --> 22:03.180
It's not anything that I think you need, but whatever.

22:03.180 --> 22:04.180
Interesting.

22:04.180 --> 22:08.860
Also, on the Xbox 360 something you can see in this lovely new HDMI would be some of the

22:08.860 --> 22:13.460
new achievements in the NCAA Football 08.

22:13.460 --> 22:17.180
Now there's an achievement list and what's kind of interesting about it is that there's

22:17.180 --> 22:20.580
actually some product placement in the achievement list.

22:20.580 --> 22:25.020
They even use for the little icons for the achievement like Pontiac and Old Spice.

22:25.020 --> 22:27.260
They're like actual official logos there.

22:27.260 --> 22:31.140
I'm trying to look at what some of these are actually called, some of these achievements.

22:31.140 --> 22:35.540
You can get the list for yourself at xbox360achievements.org.

22:35.540 --> 22:36.540
Let's see.

22:36.540 --> 22:37.540
There it is, yeah.

22:37.540 --> 22:39.180
Old Spice Red Zone Perfection.

22:39.180 --> 22:43.580
Eat a Play Now or Dynasty Mode Game with Red Zone Efficiency Rating of 100%.

22:43.580 --> 22:44.580
You get 15 gamer points for that.

22:44.580 --> 22:47.420
Pontiac 4th Quarter Comeback with a little Pontiac logo.

22:47.420 --> 22:49.300
Win a Play Now or Dynasty Mode Game.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.740
Win down by 14 to start the 4th Quarter.

22:51.740 --> 22:55.300
You know, I don't understand, but yet still with all these corporate sponsorships and

22:55.300 --> 23:00.220
now they're going to throw their logos into my achievements list, these games are still

23:00.220 --> 23:01.220
$60.

23:01.220 --> 23:06.620
It's because EA is a fucking whore when it comes to advertising in game and stuff like

23:06.620 --> 23:07.620
that.

23:07.620 --> 23:11.300
And Transformers is another game with big Heliosigns.

23:11.300 --> 23:18.820
In fact, there's achievements that involve using the Heliophone sign to kill one of the

23:18.820 --> 23:19.820
drones in the game.

23:19.820 --> 23:21.180
You get an achievement for that.

23:21.180 --> 23:27.140
So it's not anything relatively new, but I don't know.

23:27.140 --> 23:30.060
And Solid Goomba in chat says, remember the Fight Night achievements?

23:30.060 --> 23:32.300
There was like a Burger King match and all that stuff.

23:32.300 --> 23:35.120
But the interesting thing about that, I mean, yeah, it hasn't happened in a while though

23:35.120 --> 23:38.660
and the interesting thing about this is that these achievements actually have the company's

23:38.660 --> 23:39.720
logos in them.

23:39.720 --> 23:43.780
And remember that these things will show up on your gamer thing in the Xbox and when you

23:43.780 --> 23:45.660
look on the internet and all that crap.

23:45.660 --> 23:47.460
So it's just kind of interesting.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.740
It's going to filthy up your profile with corporate logos.

23:50.740 --> 23:54.780
Well, not a problem for me because I hate sports games, but I'm going to tell you this

23:54.780 --> 23:55.780
much.

23:55.780 --> 23:56.780
But you love achievements.

23:56.780 --> 24:01.700
I do like achievements, but I'm not going to buy a product because I see a fucking logo

24:01.700 --> 24:02.700
for it.

24:02.700 --> 24:07.060
If it wasn't that easy, then these people would be making billions upon billions of

24:07.060 --> 24:10.020
dollars just when having their logo out there.

24:10.020 --> 24:11.460
You don't automatically go...

24:11.460 --> 24:13.660
Well, they obviously pay for this because it works.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.660
It's like product recognition.

24:14.660 --> 24:15.660
Like, I don't know.

24:15.660 --> 24:20.380
Maybe somebody sees the little old Spice logo and goes, oh yeah, I need to pick up some

24:20.380 --> 24:21.380
deodorant.

24:21.380 --> 24:22.380
I'll get that.

24:22.380 --> 24:23.380
And then that's like in their mind.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.380
I don't know.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.380
I don't know.

24:26.380 --> 24:28.820
But whatever.

24:28.820 --> 24:32.020
That is kind of ridiculous, but one thing that is pretty awesome.

24:32.020 --> 24:35.020
It's going to be Destroy All Humans 3.

24:35.020 --> 24:40.060
It's coming out soon, and it's going to be finally making its way to Playstation 3, the

24:40.060 --> 24:42.480
360, and the Wii.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.740
No word exactly on what exactly is going to be in the game.

24:45.740 --> 24:51.380
Obviously, it's probably going to be shown at E3, but Destroy All Humans is fucking awesome.

24:51.380 --> 24:52.380
That's all I need to say.

24:52.380 --> 24:57.280
There's a perfect example of a game that's fun because you get to blow up things and

24:57.280 --> 24:58.980
throw cows.

24:58.980 --> 25:02.020
I knew you would like this news.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.020
I love the game.

25:03.020 --> 25:06.180
You can pick up a cow with your tractor beam and then hunt it.

25:06.180 --> 25:07.460
I notice there's a theme here.

25:07.460 --> 25:10.540
You like these games where you get to play as aliens and do things to humans.

25:10.540 --> 25:11.540
Not necessarily.

25:11.540 --> 25:12.900
I like Grand Theft Auto.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.420
I like sandbox games.

25:14.420 --> 25:15.420
Fair enough.

25:15.420 --> 25:16.640
So that's what's fun.

25:16.640 --> 25:22.100
So continuing our conversation from part A a long time ago, fun to you is the sandbox

25:22.100 --> 25:24.140
type of games where you can do whatever the fuck you want.

25:24.140 --> 25:28.140
Games where you can do whatever the fuck you want, and usually if the game sucks, like

25:28.140 --> 25:32.480
Driver 3, there will be things that you find in the game that are fun to do, like mess

25:32.480 --> 25:39.860
with the AI and stuff, or make your own instant replays that are ridiculous.

25:39.860 --> 25:46.740
Another very popular series that a lot of people like is Geometry Wars Galaxies, but

25:46.740 --> 25:50.300
people are looking forward to Geometry War Galaxies because they like the old school

25:50.300 --> 25:51.300
one.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.480
GameSpot put up a video this week.

25:52.480 --> 25:56.660
It was a demo of the upcoming Wii title, Geometry Wars Galaxies.

25:56.660 --> 26:00.140
What kind of caused some people to turn around and go, huh?

26:00.140 --> 26:05.300
Is that during the demo, the developer actually pauses the game and the word achievements

26:05.300 --> 26:06.700
comes up.

26:06.700 --> 26:13.620
So the question comes up, is this game actually secretly being developed for Xbox 360 as well?

26:13.620 --> 26:16.620
Or are there achievements coming to the Wii?

26:16.620 --> 26:20.260
Or is it because the game is early in development and it's a port and they just haven't gotten

26:20.260 --> 26:21.260
rid of that yet?

26:21.260 --> 26:24.500
I mean, there's a million different theories, but it certainly has made some people go,

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
huh?

26:25.500 --> 26:31.700
Well, I think it doesn't have to have the achievement system from the 360 in order to

26:31.700 --> 26:32.700
have achievements.

26:32.700 --> 26:33.700
I mean, look at Resistance.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.980
Resistance has achievements in it, but it's just for the game.

26:36.980 --> 26:37.980
It's not anything...

26:37.980 --> 26:38.980
Like internal achievements.

26:38.980 --> 26:39.980
Exactly.

26:39.980 --> 26:41.900
It's just for unlocking bonus content and stuff like that.

26:41.900 --> 26:42.900
It's not necessarily...

26:42.900 --> 26:48.220
EA has that even on the 360, like the Burnout games, you get those stupid trophies for everything

26:48.220 --> 26:49.220
you do.

26:49.220 --> 26:50.220
Yeah, exactly.

26:50.220 --> 26:51.220
You hit the gas pedal.

26:51.220 --> 26:53.220
You get a trophy.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.220
Exactly.

26:54.220 --> 27:01.180
Another interesting thing, though, coming from Geometry Wars Galaxies is they're going

27:01.180 --> 27:03.060
to have download play in there as well.

27:03.060 --> 27:07.860
So if you own the DS version of the game, you can actually transfer over and download

27:07.860 --> 27:13.060
play a full version of Geometry Wars Retro Evolved onto other stuff.

27:13.060 --> 27:18.020
Also, if you have the Wii version, you can transfer over a full version of Geometry Wars

27:18.020 --> 27:20.100
Retro Evolved onto the DS.

27:20.100 --> 27:24.260
So it's going to have cross-platform play that way.

27:24.260 --> 27:25.260
It's kind of neat.

27:25.260 --> 27:26.260
Huh.

27:26.260 --> 27:27.260
All right.

27:27.260 --> 27:28.260
That should be fun.

27:28.260 --> 27:29.260
That's kind of interesting.

27:29.260 --> 27:30.260
Wait.

27:30.260 --> 27:31.260
So you're going to be able to download it to the DS if you have the Wii one?

27:31.260 --> 27:32.260
Yeah.

27:32.260 --> 27:35.860
If you have the Wii one, you'll be able to download a playable version onto the DS.

27:35.860 --> 27:40.180
That's great, because this is a great trend that we're seeing here now that you're going

27:40.180 --> 27:41.180
to be able...

27:41.180 --> 27:43.940
And a lot of us theorized this was coming, that the DS and the Wii were going to be able

27:43.940 --> 27:44.940
to work together like that.

27:44.940 --> 27:46.420
I don't know why they don't have it before.

27:46.420 --> 27:55.620
However, with the GameCube, Metroid Prime 2, you can download the original Metroid.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.900
The Animal Crossing island is the thing I always think of.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.420
Remember in Animal Crossing you could go to the island on the Game Boy?

28:00.420 --> 28:02.420
It was awesome.

28:02.420 --> 28:03.860
Awesome.

28:03.860 --> 28:09.540
Now another thing that's super awesome, and that's because it's Grand Theft Auto IV, the

28:09.540 --> 28:10.820
brand new trailer came out.

28:10.820 --> 28:11.820
It looks pretty cool.

28:11.820 --> 28:17.620
They didn't show a whole lot in there, but definitely going to be an awesome game.

28:17.620 --> 28:21.700
The graphics looked a little bit scaled down from what they were before.

28:21.700 --> 28:26.580
Obviously though, they're probably tweaking it to make sure that the frame rate is good,

28:26.580 --> 28:33.700
but they did show some gunfights and of course car chases and all that fun stuff.

28:33.700 --> 28:36.460
Just more of a tease right now, and I'm sure there's going to be a new trailer coming out

28:36.460 --> 28:40.220
about once a month or so, especially with E3 right around the corner.

28:40.220 --> 28:44.100
You know there's going to be something that they're going to be teasing at least.

28:44.100 --> 28:45.620
Only a few months away now.

28:45.620 --> 28:50.260
All right, so are you still very excited about this?

28:50.260 --> 28:53.380
Was there any kind of revelations that the trailer had for you, or was it just more like

28:53.380 --> 28:54.380
mouth-wetting?

28:54.380 --> 28:56.380
It was just mouth-wetting.

28:56.380 --> 29:05.140
They did show the main character, Nico, actually holding onto the back of a truck, being held

29:05.140 --> 29:09.940
onto that, and then also hanging from a helicopter, which looked pretty cool.

29:09.940 --> 29:13.360
So I don't know, it looks awesome.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.260
I think once we see this game in action, it's just going to be phenomenal.

29:17.260 --> 29:23.220
And I have the collector's edition on order, because I have to have all that crap that

29:23.220 --> 29:25.220
comes with it.

29:25.220 --> 29:30.580
All right, well we're going to get into another segment here, and we're going to go from something

29:30.580 --> 29:34.980
very, very new to a classic segment on Orange Lounge Radio.

29:34.980 --> 29:39.020
It's a game we like to play, especially during Slow News Week, such as this one called Beat

29:39.020 --> 29:40.380
the Host.

29:40.380 --> 29:43.500
And tonight on Beat the Host, we're going to be looking for a contestant to call us

29:43.500 --> 29:44.880
on our Skype line.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.700
Go ahead and call now if you'd like to play.

29:46.700 --> 29:51.040
However, for tonight's Beat the Host, you should know, retro knowledge is really going

29:51.040 --> 29:52.260
to help tonight.

29:52.260 --> 29:59.600
So 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to play, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

29:59.600 --> 30:03.260
So go ahead and give us a call right now, and we will take the first person to call

30:03.260 --> 30:05.540
in on our Skype line.

30:05.540 --> 30:08.060
And the way it's going to work, we're going to change up the rules again a little bit

30:08.060 --> 30:09.060
tonight.

30:09.060 --> 30:14.100
But it is going to have to do with identifying game music or game noise, and I will let you

30:14.100 --> 30:17.500
know a little more about that when we get into the game.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.540
All right, we're starting to get some calls on the line.

30:19.540 --> 30:20.540
Let's go to a call.

30:20.540 --> 30:22.180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

30:22.180 --> 30:23.180
Who's this?

30:23.180 --> 30:24.180
Hey, it's Ronma.

30:24.180 --> 30:25.180
Hi, Ronma.

30:25.180 --> 30:26.180
Finally.

30:26.180 --> 30:27.180
Hi, Arnie.

30:27.180 --> 30:28.860
Finally, a normal sounding call.

30:28.860 --> 30:31.460
All right, we have our contestant.

30:31.460 --> 30:32.460
Stop calling everybody.

30:32.460 --> 30:33.620
Stop calling everybody.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.980
You guys can call later when we open up the Skype line for calls.

30:36.980 --> 30:39.700
Ronma, you ready to play some Beat the Host?

30:39.700 --> 30:40.700
Yeah.

30:40.700 --> 30:43.900
All right, tonight you get to challenge Loki.

30:43.900 --> 30:48.420
He's the only one because I already know the questions, and well, Irene, you would just

30:48.420 --> 30:50.220
whoop her ass, I mean, no matter what the game is.

30:50.220 --> 30:51.220
Wait, what is the topic?

30:51.220 --> 30:53.180
The topic is Atari 2600 games.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.060
Oh, yeah, pick Matt.

30:55.060 --> 30:59.100
All right, so Matt, in part A, you may remember, seemed to be-

30:59.100 --> 31:00.100
I know, I am-

31:00.100 --> 31:02.140
He flaunted his Atari 2600 knowledge.

31:02.140 --> 31:04.220
I just like playing Atari 2600.

31:04.220 --> 31:05.740
It doesn't mean I played everything.

31:05.740 --> 31:06.740
I like combat.

31:06.740 --> 31:07.740
This is going to be tough tonight.

31:07.740 --> 31:10.420
Because it's so tough, we're going to change up the rules of Beat the Host a little bit

31:10.420 --> 31:13.180
tonight because you know every time we play Beat the Host, we change the rules.

31:13.180 --> 31:14.180
Okay, Ronma?

31:14.180 --> 31:15.180
Yeah.

31:15.180 --> 31:17.540
Okay, so what we're going to do, I'm going to need you to speak nice and loud or I might

31:17.540 --> 31:19.140
not hear you over the game music, okay?

31:19.140 --> 31:20.140
All right, hold on.

31:20.140 --> 31:21.620
Let me- I'm going to leave the chat room.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.500
All right, yes, you need to leave the chat room.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.500
That's good.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.500
That's very ethical of you.

31:25.500 --> 31:26.500
I appreciate that.

31:26.500 --> 31:27.500
All right.

31:27.500 --> 31:32.780
Now, what's going to happen is that we're going to play some music from Atari 2600 games.

31:32.780 --> 31:36.420
I actually recorded myself playing some Atari 2600 games earlier today, and you're going

31:36.420 --> 31:37.740
to hear some music from it.

31:37.740 --> 31:42.420
The first one of you guys to shout out the correct answer gets a point, okay?

31:42.420 --> 31:43.420
Got it.

31:43.420 --> 31:47.360
Now, in order to help you out, because Atari 2600 tracks were kind of vague, I will give

31:47.360 --> 31:51.180
you some hints at certain time intervals to help you guys out and hopefully one of you

31:51.180 --> 31:52.740
guys actually gets the right answer, okay?

31:52.740 --> 31:53.740
All right.

31:53.740 --> 31:54.740
Cool.

31:54.740 --> 31:55.740
All right.

31:55.740 --> 31:56.740
You ready, Ronma?

31:56.740 --> 31:57.740
I'm ready.

31:57.740 --> 31:58.740
Is that as loud as you get, Ronma?

31:58.740 --> 31:59.740
Are you able to get any louder?

31:59.740 --> 32:00.740
Hold on.

32:00.740 --> 32:01.900
How's that?

32:01.900 --> 32:02.900
Much better.

32:02.900 --> 32:03.900
All right.

32:03.900 --> 32:04.900
Because we're really going to have to strain to hear you over these songs.

32:04.900 --> 32:05.900
Okay, here we go.

32:05.900 --> 32:06.900
You ready, Ronma?

32:06.900 --> 32:07.900
Ready.

32:07.900 --> 32:08.900
All right.

32:08.900 --> 32:09.900
Beat the host.

32:09.900 --> 32:19.820
Here's song, or I should say game number one.

32:19.820 --> 32:29.020
It's based on a vector arcade game, but the Atari 2600 couldn't support vector graphics.

32:29.020 --> 32:31.020
Yars revenge?

32:31.020 --> 32:32.860
No.

32:32.860 --> 32:38.860
If there was no separate hyperspace button, you use this by pulling the joystick down.

32:38.860 --> 32:39.860
Galaxian?

32:39.860 --> 32:40.860
No.

32:40.860 --> 32:42.860
Can I answer?

32:42.860 --> 32:43.860
No.

32:43.860 --> 32:48.340
When you shoot a rock, it splits into two smaller rocks.

32:48.340 --> 32:49.340
Asteroids.

32:49.340 --> 32:50.340
Asteroids.

32:50.340 --> 32:51.340
Loki got it first.

32:51.340 --> 32:52.340
Loki gets a point.

32:52.340 --> 32:53.340
Good job, Loki.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.340
Good job.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.340
Yay.

32:55.340 --> 32:56.340
All right.

32:56.340 --> 32:57.340
One point for Loki.

32:57.340 --> 32:58.340
That was asteroids.

32:58.340 --> 32:59.340
I just didn't remember the part.

32:59.340 --> 33:00.340
All right.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.340
All right.

33:01.340 --> 33:02.340
Here we go.

33:02.340 --> 33:03.340
You ready for number two, Ronma?

33:03.340 --> 33:04.340
Yeah.

33:04.340 --> 33:06.620
If you can get it like three seconds sooner next time, you'll be good.

33:06.620 --> 33:07.620
No problem.

33:07.620 --> 33:08.620
All right.

33:08.620 --> 33:14.900
Here's song, or game number two.

33:14.900 --> 33:15.900
Combat.

33:15.900 --> 33:18.220
Loki got it without even a hint.

33:18.220 --> 33:25.220
I knew he'd get it when he said he'd played all those combat back in the day.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.380
You're not looking at my computer screen, right?

33:27.380 --> 33:29.820
I can't see anything on your computer screen.

33:29.820 --> 33:30.820
That was combat.

33:30.820 --> 33:31.820
Good job.

33:31.820 --> 33:34.260
That was the default packing game for the Atari 2600, by the way.

33:34.260 --> 33:35.260
All right.

33:35.260 --> 33:36.260
Here we go.

33:36.260 --> 33:37.260
You ready for number three, Ronma?

33:37.260 --> 33:38.260
Yeah.

33:38.260 --> 33:39.260
You can do it.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.260
Come on.

33:40.260 --> 33:41.260
You're losing two nothing.

33:41.260 --> 33:42.260
Let's see what we can do.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.260
It's on command.

33:44.260 --> 33:45.260
No.

33:45.260 --> 33:46.260
Tempest.

33:46.260 --> 33:47.260
Nope.

33:47.260 --> 34:01.260
There's a version of this on Xbox Live.

34:01.260 --> 34:10.460
Centipede, millipede.

34:10.460 --> 34:13.020
Pressing the button flapped your wings.

34:13.020 --> 34:14.540
Yars event.

34:14.540 --> 34:15.540
No.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.540
Joust.

34:16.540 --> 34:18.620
Oh, you got it.

34:18.620 --> 34:19.620
Good job.

34:19.620 --> 34:21.300
It was joust.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.300
Nice job.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.300
It was joust.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.300
All right.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.300
Three nothing, Ronma.

34:25.300 --> 34:26.620
You're killing me here.

34:26.620 --> 34:28.340
Sorry, dude.

34:28.340 --> 34:29.340
It's all right.

34:29.340 --> 34:30.340
I still love you, man.

34:30.340 --> 34:31.340
All right.

34:31.340 --> 34:32.340
Here we go.

34:32.340 --> 34:33.340
Now, this one is a tricky one.

34:33.340 --> 34:34.340
I'm going to tell you straight up.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.340
This one is fucking hard, all right?

34:35.340 --> 34:36.340
So here we go.

34:36.340 --> 34:52.180
If either of you get this, I will be very impressed.

34:52.180 --> 34:55.780
Evil Otto was a character that would chase you.

34:55.780 --> 34:57.780
Robotron?

34:57.780 --> 35:09.220
Some people know this game from the big happy face bouncing creature that would stalk you.

35:09.220 --> 35:11.220
That's Evil Otto.

35:11.220 --> 35:12.620
Frenzy.

35:12.620 --> 35:14.220
No.

35:14.220 --> 35:16.700
Damn it.

35:16.700 --> 35:19.700
You shot robots in a maze.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.700
Robotron 20.

35:21.700 --> 35:22.700
No.

35:22.700 --> 35:24.700
10 seconds.

35:24.700 --> 35:30.900
Evil Otto, big happy face bouncing creature.

35:30.900 --> 35:31.900
Robots in a maze.

35:31.900 --> 35:32.900
Galaxian?

35:32.900 --> 35:33.900
Oh.

35:33.900 --> 35:34.900
Oh.

35:34.900 --> 35:35.900
I don't know.

35:35.900 --> 35:36.900
Berserk.

35:36.900 --> 35:37.900
Berserk is a game.

35:37.900 --> 35:38.900
Berserk.

35:38.900 --> 35:42.900
You know, I actually had the board game to that.

35:42.900 --> 35:43.900
You what?

35:43.900 --> 35:47.980
I actually had the board game to that like a very long time ago.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.100
Oh, good.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.420
You know, and oh well.

35:50.420 --> 35:51.420
It happens.

35:51.420 --> 35:52.420
Brain fart.

35:52.420 --> 35:53.500
Frenzy is just like that game too.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.420
Good job in the chat room though.

35:55.420 --> 35:56.420
Some folks there got Berserk.

35:56.420 --> 36:00.020
Some folks were saying it was Sword Quest, which was a really good guess, but unfortunately

36:00.020 --> 36:01.020
not right.

36:01.020 --> 36:03.780
All right, this next one's a toughie too, and I'll also be impressed if either of you

36:03.780 --> 36:14.980
get this.

36:14.980 --> 36:43.940
In this game, you are out to rescue Lady P. Lady P is being held by a jungle tribe.

36:43.940 --> 36:49.380
You start this game swinging from rope to rope, then you fight crocodiles, then you

36:49.380 --> 36:51.380
dodge falling rocks.

36:51.380 --> 36:52.380
Can I please answer?

36:52.380 --> 36:53.380
Nope.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.380
This wasn't Kongo Bongo.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.380
No.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.380
Um.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.380
Rama, you still with us?

36:57.380 --> 36:58.380
Yeah, sure.

36:58.380 --> 36:59.380
I know what the game is.

36:59.380 --> 37:00.380
I just can't remember the title.

37:00.380 --> 37:03.980
It's not Donkey Kong Jr., is it?

37:03.980 --> 37:09.540
Ten seconds, no.

37:09.540 --> 37:15.740
Lady P, jungle tribe, swinging ropes, fighting crocodiles, dodging falling rocks.

37:15.740 --> 37:18.980
You do all that in Jungle Hunt.

37:18.980 --> 37:19.980
Jungle Hunt.

37:19.980 --> 37:20.980
All right.

37:20.980 --> 37:21.980
Still three nothing in Loki's favor.

37:21.980 --> 37:22.980
You can still win it though.

37:22.980 --> 37:23.980
Okay.

37:23.980 --> 37:24.980
All right.

37:24.980 --> 37:25.980
I got an easier one for you this time.

37:25.980 --> 37:26.980
All right.

37:26.980 --> 37:27.980
You ready?

37:27.980 --> 37:28.980
Ready.

37:28.980 --> 37:29.980
Here.

37:29.980 --> 37:30.980
Here we go.

37:30.980 --> 37:31.980
Pac-Man.

37:31.980 --> 37:32.980
Oh my God.

37:32.980 --> 37:33.980
That was fast.

37:33.980 --> 37:37.720
He knew it right from the starting tone there.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.700
It was Pac-Man.

37:39.700 --> 37:44.220
Let's play a little more of that because I barely got to hear any of it.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.220
Remember little ghost chasing noises?

37:46.220 --> 37:48.620
Now here we go.

37:48.620 --> 37:50.100
Yeah, there it is.

37:50.100 --> 37:54.260
Based on a very popular arcade game, but it was considered a disappointment, the home

37:54.260 --> 37:55.260
version.

37:55.260 --> 37:57.620
I have a poster for this at my work.

37:57.620 --> 38:00.940
You eat a wafer for bonus points in Pac-Man.

38:00.940 --> 38:01.940
Look at that.

38:01.940 --> 38:02.940
Damn.

38:02.940 --> 38:03.940
All right.

38:03.940 --> 38:04.940
That's all right.

38:04.940 --> 38:05.980
There's four left.

38:05.980 --> 38:08.460
So Rama, you can still tie it up.

38:08.460 --> 38:09.460
Working on it.

38:09.460 --> 38:10.460
All right.

38:10.460 --> 38:11.460
It's all right, Rama.

38:11.460 --> 38:12.460
It was a long time ago.

38:12.460 --> 38:14.660
I barely remember these when I was playing through them today.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.660
All right.

38:15.660 --> 38:16.660
Now this one is fun.

38:16.660 --> 38:19.860
This one's a tricky one, but I love this game.

38:19.860 --> 38:24.500
Burger time.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.500
No.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.500
Popeye.

38:28.500 --> 38:34.980
Oh, Rama gets one.

38:34.980 --> 38:35.980
That's right.

38:35.980 --> 38:36.980
That's right.

38:36.980 --> 38:37.980
It sounded familiar.

38:37.980 --> 38:38.980
That's right.

38:38.980 --> 38:42.060
Of course, you can kind of hear a little theme being used in the game.

38:42.060 --> 38:46.180
There was a movie out around the same time, and remember, this was a really cool game

38:46.180 --> 38:50.300
at the time because the stages were so unique, and in that first stage that you were hearing,

38:50.300 --> 38:54.500
olive oil was actually throwing hearts down that you had to catch before they sank in

38:54.500 --> 38:55.500
the water.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.700
Rama is on the board.

38:56.700 --> 38:57.700
Good job, Rama.

38:57.700 --> 39:00.580
See, now you don't get shut out, and that feels good.

39:00.580 --> 39:01.580
So all right.

39:01.580 --> 39:02.580
Yeah.

39:02.580 --> 39:03.580
All right.

39:03.580 --> 39:04.580
Well, keep it up, Rama.

39:04.580 --> 39:05.580
All right.

39:05.580 --> 39:06.580
Let's do the next one.

39:06.580 --> 39:07.580
Three left.

39:07.580 --> 39:08.580
Here we go.

39:08.580 --> 39:20.700
I need a more specific answer.

39:20.700 --> 39:21.940
Pitfall 2.

39:21.940 --> 39:24.900
Yes, it's Pitfall 2.

39:24.900 --> 39:25.900
Oh.

39:25.900 --> 39:27.380
Oh, poor Rama.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.820
It is Pitfall 2.

39:28.820 --> 39:31.900
It was one of the first games to feature a full soundtrack.

39:31.900 --> 39:36.420
The sequel to another popular Atari game in the main character was Pitfall Harry.

39:36.420 --> 39:38.140
Rama so close.

39:38.140 --> 39:39.140
You know what?

39:39.140 --> 39:41.340
Just because Loki pisses me off sometimes, I'm going to give that to you anyway.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.340
We're going to give it to you.

39:43.340 --> 39:44.340
All right.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.340
All right.

39:45.340 --> 39:46.340
So there we go.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.340
So what do we have?

39:47.340 --> 39:48.340
Four for Loki.

39:48.340 --> 39:49.340
Two for Rama.

39:49.340 --> 39:50.340
All right.

39:50.340 --> 39:51.340
Here we go.

39:51.340 --> 39:52.340
Let's go to another one.

39:52.340 --> 39:53.340
This one is also very hard.

39:53.340 --> 39:54.340
Here we go.

39:54.340 --> 39:55.340
Bump and jump.

39:55.340 --> 39:56.340
Bump and jump.

39:56.340 --> 40:07.500
No.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.980
This game was also based on a popular movie series.

40:10.980 --> 40:11.980
Star Trek?

40:11.980 --> 40:12.980
No.

40:12.980 --> 40:13.980
Star Wars?

40:13.980 --> 40:14.980
Nope.

40:14.980 --> 40:15.980
DC?

40:15.980 --> 40:16.980
Nope.

40:16.980 --> 40:25.340
You can walk into a phone booth to change from one character to another.

40:25.340 --> 40:26.340
Superman?

40:26.340 --> 40:27.340
Yes.

40:27.340 --> 40:28.340
Rama got it.

40:28.340 --> 40:29.340
It was Superman.

40:29.340 --> 40:30.340
Ah.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.340
Remember the Superman game?

40:31.340 --> 40:32.340
No.

40:32.340 --> 40:33.340
It was great.

40:33.340 --> 40:36.660
It was so weird because like you could fly up and you would fly into another screen.

40:36.660 --> 40:39.220
Like you moved up, down, left, and right.

40:39.220 --> 40:40.220
Like it was weird.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.220
It was very weird.

40:41.220 --> 40:42.220
There you go.

40:42.220 --> 40:43.220
Rama's got three now.

40:43.220 --> 40:44.220
Well, because you gave him one.

40:44.220 --> 40:45.220
Yeah, I did.

40:45.220 --> 40:46.220
I totally gave him one.

40:46.220 --> 40:47.220
All right.

40:47.220 --> 40:48.220
That's all right.

40:48.220 --> 40:49.220
Let's see if you can tie it up, Rama.

40:49.220 --> 40:50.220
This is the last one.

40:50.220 --> 40:51.220
All right.

40:51.220 --> 40:52.220
And this is a doozy.

40:52.220 --> 40:53.420
This is a hell of a game.

40:53.420 --> 40:55.420
Here we go.

40:55.420 --> 40:59.420
Ms. Pac-Man.

40:59.420 --> 41:01.420
No.

41:01.420 --> 41:05.420
Pac-Man 2.

41:05.420 --> 41:07.100
No.

41:07.100 --> 41:10.420
This game was made by Mystique Entertainment.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.420
Adventure?

41:12.420 --> 41:14.420
No.

41:14.420 --> 41:16.420
No.

41:16.420 --> 41:25.420
It's a highly controversial game that shows up on lots of gag Atari 2600 lists.

41:25.420 --> 41:26.420
Custer's Revenge.

41:26.420 --> 41:27.420
Ah.

41:27.420 --> 41:28.420
Good job, Loki.

41:28.420 --> 41:29.420
It is Custer's Revenge.

41:29.420 --> 41:34.060
And, of course, the object of the game, your naked ass has to fuck an Indian girl lots

41:34.060 --> 41:35.060
and lots.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.060
And that's why the game is very controversial.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.060
You were just playing that earlier.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.060
Yeah.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.060
That's when I was recording the clips.

41:40.060 --> 41:41.060
Oh my God.

41:41.060 --> 41:42.060
That was so funny.

41:42.060 --> 41:44.060
That's why you couldn't play because you walked in here when I was setting it up.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.060
Oh, yeah.

41:45.060 --> 41:46.060
All right.

41:46.060 --> 41:47.060
You got the score.

41:47.060 --> 41:52.380
Rama, you got three points, a very good showing, and, unfortunately, Loki beat you with five,

41:52.380 --> 41:55.580
so, unfortunately, you got beat by the host tonight, but you made a damn good effort on

41:55.580 --> 41:56.580
a very tough topic.

41:56.580 --> 41:57.580
Thanks, man.

41:57.580 --> 41:58.580
I appreciate it.

41:58.580 --> 41:59.820
No problemo.

41:59.820 --> 42:04.300
Take any shout-outs or plugs you want to give, as long as we have you on the air as a consolation

42:04.300 --> 42:05.300
prize.

42:05.300 --> 42:09.660
Visit my website, www.djromas.net.

42:09.660 --> 42:10.660
There you go.

42:10.660 --> 42:11.660
Take us from Bonneville 7RL.

42:11.660 --> 42:12.660
All right.

42:12.660 --> 42:13.660
Sounds good.

42:13.660 --> 42:14.660
Thanks, Rama.

42:14.660 --> 42:15.660
Take care.

42:15.660 --> 42:16.660
All right.

42:16.660 --> 42:21.060
Now, the audio looked a little low to me on the board here, but it seems like the chat

42:21.060 --> 42:25.220
room was able to play along just fine, so I'm hoping the audio was just fine there as

42:25.220 --> 42:27.540
far as things went.

42:27.540 --> 42:29.820
Otherwise, I'll have to fix that in post-production.

42:29.820 --> 42:30.820
We'll see.

42:30.820 --> 42:32.820
I think we're good, though.

42:32.820 --> 42:34.500
Live radio, boys and girls.

42:34.500 --> 42:37.060
Take it or leave it.

42:37.060 --> 42:38.580
We're going to go back into some gaming news.

42:38.580 --> 42:40.580
Let's talk about the game Turrican.

42:40.580 --> 42:45.620
This is a game that was on the Commodore 64, kind of compared to an earlier version of

42:45.620 --> 42:48.820
Metroid slash Contra.

42:48.820 --> 42:54.140
Turrican was a game that was made for the Commodore 64, however, a German programmer

42:54.140 --> 42:56.980
has made a freeware remake of the game.

42:56.980 --> 43:05.340
It's called Hurrican, and you can download Hurrican from the site, Hurrican-game.de,

43:05.340 --> 43:06.340
because it's German.

43:06.340 --> 43:07.480
It's a 40-megabyte game.

43:07.480 --> 43:11.780
It's Windows-compatible, and if you remember gaming on the Commodore 64, you're probably

43:11.780 --> 43:16.540
going to love this, so check it out, Hurrican.

43:16.540 --> 43:21.220
Another game that's getting a sequel, and it's long due, I think, and this is, I guess,

43:21.220 --> 43:27.540
a rumor for right now, but Parasite Eve is slated on possibly coming out to the PlayStation

43:27.540 --> 43:36.820
3 and 360, and no word exactly on any details on that, but I don't know.

43:36.820 --> 43:41.500
I guess people are thinking, because they originally announced Parasite Eve 3 as a mobile

43:41.500 --> 43:45.220
game, but they're thinking this is going to be something else.

43:45.220 --> 43:52.900
This is also, I guess, Quarterman from EGM is saying that they're going to be, Dio Kojima

43:52.900 --> 43:58.660
is going to be working on another PS3 exclusive title.

43:58.660 --> 43:59.820
No word on what that is.

43:59.820 --> 44:06.660
People are thinking maybe Zone of Enders or something like that.

44:06.660 --> 44:09.380
That's pretty much it.

44:09.380 --> 44:12.500
Well I would hope Parasite Eve is actually going to get the full-blown next-gen treatment,

44:12.500 --> 44:13.940
not just some shitty cell phone game.

44:13.940 --> 44:14.940
I hope so.

44:14.940 --> 44:16.420
Weren't you a fan of Parasite Eve, Rice Princess?

44:16.420 --> 44:18.580
I still remember you were the person that introduced me to that.

44:18.580 --> 44:19.580
I was?

44:19.580 --> 44:20.580
Or I'm smoking crack.

44:20.580 --> 44:21.580
Maybe I'm smoking crack.

44:21.580 --> 44:23.020
I thought it was a good game.

44:23.020 --> 44:26.280
I never actually beat it, but I played through a good part of it.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.820
That was me in most Final Fantasy games.

44:28.820 --> 44:30.300
I like the combat system in that.

44:30.300 --> 44:34.500
The combat system in the first Parasite Eve reminds me much of what they're doing in Final

44:34.500 --> 44:40.820
Fantasy XII right now, how that system, you have a big dome or whatever that you can attack

44:40.820 --> 44:41.820
in and stuff.

44:41.820 --> 44:45.000
It reminds me very much of that.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.960
Well before we get to the Skype line, I've got one more story for you guys.

44:48.960 --> 44:53.860
Since it is July 1st, also known as Canada Day, I thought those you Canadians would appreciate

44:53.860 --> 44:55.900
this.

44:55.900 --> 44:59.860
You can get a red PlayStation 3 and it's a special Canada event.

44:59.860 --> 45:02.060
You can only get this in Canada.

45:02.060 --> 45:04.060
It's actually a contest that's being held.

45:04.060 --> 45:09.740
The contest is being run through July 15th at PlayStation.ca and you can actually win

45:09.740 --> 45:16.020
yourself a red PlayStation 3 or a limited edition Canada PlayStation 3 t-shirt there.

45:16.020 --> 45:19.140
It doesn't have the maple leaf on it, but it has a 3 in place of the maple leaf.

45:19.140 --> 45:21.860
Otherwise it kind of looks like the Canadian flag.

45:21.860 --> 45:23.180
So there you go.

45:23.180 --> 45:27.700
Only 3 of those red PlayStation 3s by the way will be made.

45:27.700 --> 45:28.940
So that's kind of neat.

45:28.940 --> 45:33.020
Well technically 4 since there's already been a red PlayStation 3 out there custom made.

45:33.020 --> 45:34.020
Well that's different though.

45:34.020 --> 45:37.100
It's kind of officially endorsed so to speak by Sony.

45:37.100 --> 45:40.960
So I know we have some Canadian listeners there so you might want to go enter that contest

45:40.960 --> 45:42.840
and brag to all your friends, eh?

45:42.840 --> 45:47.120
This is completely random, but I feel that we should talk about this real quick.

45:47.120 --> 45:50.580
We went over the fries the other day because I had my motherboard.

45:50.580 --> 45:51.580
There's a fan that went out.

45:51.580 --> 45:54.660
My computer is kind of on the fritz.

45:54.660 --> 45:59.660
But Nelly picked up this USB stripper.

45:59.660 --> 46:01.840
It's on a stripping pole that you can buy.

46:01.840 --> 46:04.460
I've seen that before because we were thinking about getting it for her for her birthday

46:04.460 --> 46:06.500
before we realized we were all freaking poor.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.340
I thought that was funny.

46:08.340 --> 46:09.340
I don't know.

46:09.340 --> 46:10.340
That was great.

46:10.340 --> 46:11.340
Did you guys actually see it in motion or what?

46:11.340 --> 46:16.860
No, but we almost bought it and then like common sense kicked in and we said no we probably

46:16.860 --> 46:19.820
don't need a $30 USB stripper.

46:19.820 --> 46:20.820
Why not?

46:20.820 --> 46:21.820
I don't know.

46:21.820 --> 46:28.420
Because she wanted to take it to work and you know her work wouldn't really think too

46:28.420 --> 46:30.420
highly of that.

46:30.420 --> 46:33.900
All right, well we're going to open up the Skype line.

46:33.900 --> 46:41.500
If you'd like to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can call us on the actual program Skype.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.340
Orange Lounge Radio is our username.

46:43.340 --> 46:47.580
We always like to hear from our listeners and get your guys' two cents on what's going

46:47.580 --> 46:49.540
on in the gaming scene and the gaming community.

46:49.540 --> 46:53.440
If you have any feedback to tonight's articles or what have you or you just want to tell

46:53.440 --> 46:57.500
Rice Princess to say hi to you and actually talk on the program tonight, all of that you

46:57.500 --> 47:00.140
can do by calling our program.

47:00.140 --> 47:02.900
So while we wait for some calls because there's a little bit of a lag, do you have any last

47:02.900 --> 47:03.900
minute stories?

47:03.900 --> 47:04.900
No.

47:04.900 --> 47:05.900
No?

47:05.900 --> 47:06.900
No last minute stories tonight?

47:06.900 --> 47:07.900
Not at the moment.

47:07.900 --> 47:08.900
Oh my gosh.

47:08.900 --> 47:09.900
It really is a slow gaming week.

47:09.900 --> 47:15.580
I was looking for stuff but I haven't seen anything.

47:15.580 --> 47:17.780
Well should I pick up Project Silpheed?

47:17.780 --> 47:22.540
I haven't, I saw it scroll by your screen there and I'm curious about that game but

47:22.540 --> 47:23.540
I don't know.

47:23.540 --> 47:24.540
It looks okay.

47:24.540 --> 47:25.700
I want to get this t-shirt.

47:25.700 --> 47:30.140
It looks like one of those Target t-shirts, like the Don't Bother Me ones and it says

47:30.140 --> 47:39.620
good and it has the male, female, almost looks like a restroom logo or something and that's

47:39.620 --> 47:44.000
good and then better has a guy with two girls and then best shows a guy playing a video

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
game.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.300
We're finally getting calls, thank God.

47:47.300 --> 47:52.940
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

47:52.940 --> 47:54.940
Hello you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

47:54.940 --> 47:55.940
Oh damn it, it didn't work.

47:55.940 --> 47:56.940
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lawn's Radio.

47:56.940 --> 47:57.940
Wow.

47:57.940 --> 48:14.860
If you always want to test your Skype line, you can do that by calling Echo 1-2-3.

48:14.860 --> 48:18.860
This is a username on Skype if you'd always like to test your connection in advance which

48:18.860 --> 48:19.860
we highly recommend.

48:19.860 --> 48:21.860
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

48:21.860 --> 48:22.860
Hey it's DJ Tyrant.

48:22.860 --> 48:23.860
Hey!

48:23.860 --> 48:25.860
What's up DJ Tyrant, how are you doing?

48:25.860 --> 48:26.860
Whoa.

48:26.860 --> 48:32.220
Hey I'm doing pretty good, I'm at Anime Expo 2007 right now.

48:32.220 --> 48:33.220
Awesome, how's Anime?

48:33.220 --> 48:37.140
Now you actually got into Anime Expo 2007 on behalf of Orange Lawn's Radio right?

48:37.140 --> 48:38.420
Yes I did.

48:38.420 --> 48:42.940
Alright, then you better have a good report for us, what's going on at Anime Expo?

48:42.940 --> 48:52.340
Uh, lots of anime and stuff, there's actually a lot of gaming stuff also, what did I check

48:52.340 --> 48:53.340
out today?

48:53.340 --> 48:58.300
I checked out the Naruto fighting game for the Wii, those are a little sloppy for that

48:58.300 --> 48:59.300
though.

48:59.300 --> 49:02.180
Oh, wait, what was sloppy, the controls are sloppy?

49:02.180 --> 49:03.180
Yeah.

49:03.180 --> 49:04.180
Oh that sucks.

49:04.180 --> 49:11.780
But um, there's Guilty Gear, the U1XX, forget the subtitle for that, but.

49:11.780 --> 49:12.780
Accent Core.

49:12.780 --> 49:15.260
Look, he says it's Accent Core.

49:15.260 --> 49:17.260
Yeah, that sounds right.

49:17.260 --> 49:22.460
I didn't get to play it, but it looked pretty solid.

49:22.460 --> 49:27.100
Interesting, so I don't usually go to Anime Expos where there's a lot of game presence

49:27.100 --> 49:31.180
there, but it sounds like a few game companies are making their way out to Anime Expo to

49:31.180 --> 49:32.180
plug their stuff?

49:32.180 --> 49:37.980
Yeah, they are, apparently Square has a bunch of stuff for Oven, I didn't get to swing by

49:37.980 --> 49:42.820
their booth because I don't play Oven, but I saw a lot of people with stuff from Final

49:42.820 --> 49:43.820
Fantasy 11.

49:43.820 --> 49:46.940
Oh my god, that was like E3 a couple years ago, we did nothing but play at the Square

49:46.940 --> 49:49.940
booth on their Final Fantasy 11 events, that was when I was sadly sadly addicted.

49:49.940 --> 49:52.980
I bet there's a lot of people still really addicted.

49:52.980 --> 49:54.540
Remember, you won a hard drive.

49:54.540 --> 49:56.140
I did, that's right.

49:56.140 --> 50:00.220
My computer actually came from that Final Fantasy event in my first E3, but anyway,

50:00.220 --> 50:01.220
that's another story.

50:01.220 --> 50:05.620
I was going to ask, I was going to say, video game cosplay is very popular, have you seen

50:05.620 --> 50:08.020
any cool cosplay while you've been there?

50:08.020 --> 50:15.380
Yeah, there's tons, there's a while attic, I found about three really really good costumes,

50:15.380 --> 50:21.820
and I'll post some pictures up when I get home, but they're like really well done,

50:21.820 --> 50:26.980
they look exactly like they look in game, which I found really impressive.

50:26.980 --> 50:31.380
Now Rama would like to point out for those of us here, that Anime Expo is not an anime

50:31.380 --> 50:36.060
con, it's a trade show, and apparently there's a very distinct difference, I guess because

50:36.060 --> 50:43.060
I don't follow the con scene enough, it kind of feels the same to me, but, I see.

50:43.060 --> 50:46.020
Well what about, you said there was some gaming stuff there, what about tournaments, is there

50:46.020 --> 50:48.940
any big tournaments, or I know these cons usually have a game room, what kinds of stuff

50:48.940 --> 50:49.940
have been around in the game?

50:49.940 --> 50:56.260
Yeah, there's a pretty big console room with Guitar Hero and the typical fighting type

50:56.260 --> 50:58.260
games.

50:58.260 --> 51:03.020
There was a Pokemon tournament last night, and there's been various fighting game tournaments

51:03.020 --> 51:09.100
for Guilty Gear and Naruto, there's a Smash Bros tournament tomorrow that I will be playing

51:09.100 --> 51:13.940
in and losing in the first round, and so, there's definitely a lot of stuff for gamers

51:13.940 --> 51:15.980
to do at the show.

51:15.980 --> 51:16.980
Very cool.

51:16.980 --> 51:20.160
A Super Smash Bros tournament, man, that game's been out for how long, and it's still so,

51:20.160 --> 51:21.160
so popular.

51:21.160 --> 51:27.260
Yet I didn't hear you say DDR or Beat Mania or any of those games that we used to go to

51:27.260 --> 51:28.260
all the time.

51:28.260 --> 51:33.620
No, the DDR music games kind of, I don't know, they've kind of died off in popularity over

51:33.620 --> 51:34.620
here on the West Coast.

51:34.620 --> 51:35.620
Ouch.

51:35.620 --> 51:42.260
Otherwise, there is an arcade, though, and they are pretty busy with Supernova and Extreme,

51:42.260 --> 51:46.860
and I think Drum Mania V.

51:46.860 --> 51:49.380
So how long is the con running?

51:49.380 --> 51:50.380
How long is the con?

51:50.380 --> 51:51.380
Tomorrow.

51:51.380 --> 51:52.380
It ends tomorrow?

51:52.380 --> 51:53.380
Yeah.

51:53.380 --> 51:57.140
All right, well, make sure you go get your hands on Guilty Gear for us, and you can give

51:57.140 --> 51:58.140
some impressions of it.

51:58.140 --> 51:59.140
Definitely, definitely will.

51:59.140 --> 52:00.140
All right.

52:00.140 --> 52:04.620
Rama would like to clarify, Anime Expo is a trade show because their board of directors

52:04.620 --> 52:08.340
are people from the anime industry, and they use Anime Expo to promote new titles more

52:08.340 --> 52:09.660
than any other con.

52:09.660 --> 52:15.340
Think of Anime Expo as the anime equivalent of E3, and Insanus adds to that, also, Anime

52:15.340 --> 52:16.340
Expo sucks.

52:16.340 --> 52:20.260
Well, that's an opinion, but you sound like you're having a lot of fun at the con, right?

52:20.260 --> 52:21.260
Right, Jimmy?

52:21.260 --> 52:24.820
All right, he just wants the QQ, give me a hand and come and do it.

52:24.820 --> 52:28.880
All right, well, Jimmy, anything else you want to add about the convention?

52:28.880 --> 52:31.860
If you can come next year, we can come hang out, I'll buy drinks.

52:31.860 --> 52:34.420
Oh, hey, if there's drinks there, I'm there.

52:34.420 --> 52:37.700
But I will be in SoCal for E for All, so we'll see you then.

52:37.700 --> 52:40.140
All right, have a nice night, guys.

52:40.140 --> 52:41.140
All right, later, buddy.

52:41.140 --> 52:42.140
Thanks for the call.

52:42.140 --> 52:43.140
Bye.

52:43.140 --> 52:44.140
Bye.

52:44.140 --> 52:46.700
Our roving reporter, Jimmy, also known as DJ Tyrant.

52:46.700 --> 52:48.460
All right, let's go to the phones.

52:48.460 --> 52:50.060
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

52:50.060 --> 52:51.060
Who's this?

52:51.060 --> 52:52.060
It's GS68.

52:52.060 --> 52:53.060
Hello, GS68.

52:53.060 --> 52:55.060
What's on your mind, my friend?

52:55.060 --> 53:00.100
First of all, it wasn't me calling before I met because my mic wasn't set up right.

53:00.100 --> 53:01.100
It's all right.

53:01.100 --> 53:02.100
We'll forgive you.

53:02.100 --> 53:05.740
All right, you're the one, could you hear us yelling at you in Spanish and everything?

53:05.740 --> 53:06.740
Yeah.

53:06.740 --> 53:07.740
All right.

53:07.740 --> 53:08.740
That's got to be embarrassing.

53:08.740 --> 53:09.740
All right, well, now you're on.

53:09.740 --> 53:10.740
What's on your mind?

53:10.740 --> 53:16.700
First of all, I was eating cup noodles when rice persons were staying angry, so I had

53:16.700 --> 53:20.300
to spit that out.

53:20.300 --> 53:23.780
That is probably going to be one of those OLR taglines that's beaten into the ground,

53:23.780 --> 53:24.780
but that's all right.

53:24.780 --> 53:25.780
It is kind of funny.

53:25.780 --> 53:26.780
I just hope nobody takes it the wrong way.

53:26.780 --> 53:29.700
Like, I don't want, like, somebody who's, like, uninformed on this program to be all,

53:29.700 --> 53:32.180
like, they use the word bag too much in their program.

53:32.180 --> 53:35.100
Anyway, what else do you want to talk about tonight, GS68?

53:35.100 --> 53:41.900
Yeah, I've been, like, on a Guitar Hero message board, I've been talking about the hyper speed

53:41.900 --> 53:44.300
code lately and how some people think it's a cheat.

53:44.300 --> 53:45.540
Like, what are your thoughts on it?

53:45.540 --> 53:47.380
I do not know of the hyper speed code.

53:47.380 --> 53:48.500
Give me a little background on this.

53:48.500 --> 53:50.580
What's this about?

53:50.580 --> 53:56.940
On the Guitar Hero 2 title screen, you press orange, blue, orange, yellow, orange, blue,

53:56.940 --> 54:00.700
orange, yellow, and then it says cheat activated hyper speed.

54:00.700 --> 54:02.580
And what exactly does that do to the game?

54:02.580 --> 54:05.060
Does it make the songs run faster or something?

54:05.060 --> 54:07.180
No, it makes the notes scroll faster.

54:07.180 --> 54:12.060
It's kind of like times two speed in DDR or high speed in Beatmania.

54:12.060 --> 54:15.940
Oh, okay, well, I don't know if that's cheating or not.

54:15.940 --> 54:20.220
I mean, I guess maybe the developers intended it to be a cheat if that's what they're labeling

54:20.220 --> 54:24.700
it as in the game, but I don't know, like, in Beatmania, I never considered that a cheat.

54:24.700 --> 54:27.780
I mean, God, that's what you have to use to play some of those songs.

54:27.780 --> 54:28.980
I don't know any other way.

54:28.980 --> 54:32.660
But I don't know, maybe it is cheating, even in Beatmania, and for whatever reason the

54:32.660 --> 54:35.220
community doesn't really look at it that way.

54:35.220 --> 54:38.180
But I think they just never looked at it that way because it's always been considered a

54:38.180 --> 54:39.180
modifier.

54:39.180 --> 54:40.180
Yeah.

54:40.180 --> 54:46.500
Because, like, people whose music gaming experience is one of the Guitar Hero, like, have never

54:46.500 --> 54:51.260
heard of it being a mod, so when they saw that it was a cheat, they automatically thought

54:51.260 --> 54:54.240
it was a cheat because it says cheat activated.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.940
What are your thoughts on it?

54:55.940 --> 54:57.900
Well, I think it's legit.

54:57.900 --> 55:02.780
I mean, if you think it helps you, just use it.

55:02.780 --> 55:09.380
I mean, it's been out of the money gates for years without question, so why call it cheating

55:09.380 --> 55:10.380
now?

55:10.380 --> 55:12.220
I mean, it's still the same notes, right?

55:12.220 --> 55:13.220
Yeah.

55:13.220 --> 55:16.020
And it's not going to help you beat Jordan on Expert, right?

55:16.020 --> 55:18.140
Probably, probably not.

55:18.140 --> 55:22.260
So what's the big freaking deal?

55:22.260 --> 55:26.340
I mean, if you close your eyes and play the song, I mean, does Hyperspeed really make

55:26.340 --> 55:27.340
a difference?

55:27.340 --> 55:31.660
Well, if you close your eyes and play the song, is that how you have to beat Jordan

55:31.660 --> 55:32.660
Expert?

55:32.660 --> 55:33.660
Probably, huh?

55:33.660 --> 55:37.820
Well, if you for some reason memorized the song, I mean...

55:37.820 --> 55:43.220
I think if you've actually gone to the great extents to memorize Guitar Hero 2 songs, instead

55:43.220 --> 55:49.020
of using the speed modifier, I would recommend you go outside.

55:49.020 --> 55:50.020
I'm just messing.

55:50.020 --> 55:51.020
Hypothetically speaking.

55:51.020 --> 55:52.020
I know, I know.

55:52.020 --> 55:55.780
Hey, people memorize the DDR songs, so why not the Guitar Hero songs?

55:55.780 --> 55:56.780
It happens.

55:56.780 --> 55:57.780
Yeah.

55:57.780 --> 55:59.780
All right, well, any other thoughts, GS68?

55:59.780 --> 56:02.020
No, that's pretty much it.

56:02.020 --> 56:05.260
All right, well, thank you so much for the call, and have a great night, and thanks for

56:05.260 --> 56:06.260
calling.

56:06.260 --> 56:07.260
All right, thank you too.

56:07.260 --> 56:08.260
All right, later.

56:08.260 --> 56:09.260
Later.

56:09.260 --> 56:13.140
All right, let's go to some more calls here on the Skype line, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

56:13.140 --> 56:14.140
Let's go to this call.

56:14.140 --> 56:15.140
Oops.

56:15.140 --> 56:18.380
If I can, go to the next call.

56:18.380 --> 56:22.100
The call I was just about to pick up dropped, live radio, boys and girls.

56:22.100 --> 56:23.100
Good one, Rock.

56:23.100 --> 56:24.100
Geez.

56:24.100 --> 56:25.100
It happens all the fucking time.

56:25.100 --> 56:26.100
Let's go to this call.

56:26.100 --> 56:27.100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

56:27.100 --> 56:28.100
Who's this?

56:28.100 --> 56:29.100
It'll be Dark Knight.

56:29.100 --> 56:30.100
Hello, Dark Knight.

56:30.100 --> 56:31.100
What's on your mind?

56:31.100 --> 56:32.100
Nothing much.

56:32.100 --> 56:34.300
Thought y'all would talk about Soul Calibur for a little bit.

56:34.300 --> 56:37.300
I wanted to touch up on something I discussed last week.

56:37.300 --> 56:38.300
Sure.

56:38.300 --> 56:40.020
Soul Calibur IV online, good stuff.

56:40.020 --> 56:41.020
What's up?

56:41.020 --> 56:45.700
It's supposed to be like a side story game, Soul Calibur Legends.

56:45.700 --> 56:46.700
Yes.

56:46.700 --> 56:49.700
This is the game that's being created for the Nintendo Wii, if I remember right, right?

56:49.700 --> 56:50.700
It's not side-scrolling, though.

56:50.700 --> 56:51.700
It's just kind of a hack-and-slash.

56:51.700 --> 56:52.700
Yeah.

56:52.700 --> 56:59.340
Wasn't that how Mortal Kombat, what was that, Shallon Monks or whatever was kind of like

56:59.340 --> 57:00.340
that?

57:00.340 --> 57:01.340
Yeah.

57:01.340 --> 57:02.340
Oh, okay.

57:02.340 --> 57:03.340
That might be kind of cool.

57:03.340 --> 57:04.340
I was thinking more of Tekken Force.

57:04.340 --> 57:08.060
Oh, like one of the adventure modes that you get in the Tekken games?

57:08.060 --> 57:12.020
I would say it looks more like the Mortal Kombat Shallon Monks games, because I know

57:12.020 --> 57:14.740
Tekken Force is more like Final Fight or something like that.

57:14.740 --> 57:18.020
Here's the only thing I care about, is Ivy in it, yes or no?

57:18.020 --> 57:19.020
Yes.

57:19.020 --> 57:20.020
Sold.

57:20.020 --> 57:24.900
I think it's mostly reviving around Siegfried, I think, if I'm not mistaken.

57:24.900 --> 57:25.900
All right.

57:25.900 --> 57:27.900
Well, what else have you heard on the game?

57:27.900 --> 57:34.340
Just early development details and whatnot, they had a picture on it on Kotaku.com, and

57:34.340 --> 57:39.300
it just looked like a test shot, because all I saw was basically Siegfried swinging a sword

57:39.300 --> 57:42.300
around a bunch of mummies.

57:42.300 --> 57:48.660
I mean, I like the concept and all, so.

57:48.660 --> 57:52.020
Is it the type of game you think you're going to buy?

57:52.020 --> 57:53.500
I don't own a Wii, so.

57:53.500 --> 57:54.500
Oh, you don't own a Wii?

57:54.500 --> 57:55.500
I can't really answer that question.

57:55.500 --> 57:58.620
Is that because you don't want one or because you can't find one?

57:58.620 --> 57:59.620
Both.

57:59.620 --> 58:03.780
I actually decided that I was going to go get a 360.

58:03.780 --> 58:04.780
Ah, okay.

58:04.780 --> 58:05.780
All right.

58:05.780 --> 58:08.220
But that won't be until November's top with the office itself.

58:08.220 --> 58:09.220
Well, you never know.

58:09.220 --> 58:12.460
If you ever luck out, maybe the game will come out cross-platform.

58:12.460 --> 58:15.900
Yeah, give it time and whatnot.

58:15.900 --> 58:21.340
Another game I had on mind, but I think I just totally lost track.

58:21.340 --> 58:22.340
Guitar Hero 80s.

58:22.340 --> 58:26.980
I actually saw Dom's song, Glitz, and everything, and there are actually some decent songs that

58:26.980 --> 58:27.980
I loved.

58:27.980 --> 58:28.980
I don't know why some of y'all didn't like it.

58:28.980 --> 58:29.980
Some of y'all wasn't liking some of the songs.

58:29.980 --> 58:30.980
Yeah, what's your problem, Rice Princess?

58:30.980 --> 58:33.980
Why didn't you like Guitar Hero's 80s editions?

58:33.980 --> 58:34.980
What's your big issue?

58:34.980 --> 58:38.380
Well, if I knew what any of the songs were, I might like it better.

58:38.380 --> 58:41.300
I mean, listen to Butt Rock in the 80s.

58:41.300 --> 58:42.420
That's just because you're a child.

58:42.420 --> 58:43.420
How old are you, Rice Princess?

58:43.420 --> 58:44.420
I'm a child.

58:44.420 --> 58:45.580
I am not a child.

58:45.580 --> 58:47.060
People in the chatroom are children.

58:47.060 --> 58:49.060
How old are you?

58:49.060 --> 58:50.060
72.

58:50.060 --> 58:52.580
You're not 72, and you weren't born in 72.

58:52.580 --> 58:53.580
73.

58:53.580 --> 58:54.580
Come on, how old are you?

58:54.580 --> 58:55.580
I'm 25.

58:55.580 --> 58:56.580
25.

58:56.580 --> 58:57.580
See, she's just a baby.

58:57.580 --> 58:58.580
I am not a baby.

58:58.580 --> 59:00.460
How could you call me a baby?

59:00.460 --> 59:01.780
25 is not a baby.

59:01.780 --> 59:03.780
How could you call me a baby?

59:03.780 --> 59:08.660
If you're older than most of the people in the chatroom, you're not a baby.

59:08.660 --> 59:10.540
You're a baby.

59:10.540 --> 59:13.300
Do you remember Friendship Bracelets and Garbage Pail Kids?

59:13.300 --> 59:14.300
Yeah.

59:14.300 --> 59:15.300
Do you remember Slap Bracelets?

59:15.300 --> 59:16.300
Yes, I do.

59:16.300 --> 59:17.300
Yeah.

59:17.300 --> 59:18.300
Those were pretty awesome.

59:18.300 --> 59:19.300
And Hypercolor Shirts.

59:19.300 --> 59:20.300
Yeah, I do.

59:20.300 --> 59:21.300
Yeah, anyway.

59:21.300 --> 59:22.300
All right.

59:22.300 --> 59:23.300
Anyhow.

59:23.300 --> 59:24.300
Well, then I don't know what her problem is.

59:24.300 --> 59:25.580
She was just listening to the wrong kind of music in the 80s.

59:25.580 --> 59:26.580
The wrong kind of music?

59:26.580 --> 59:27.580
No, I don't.

59:27.580 --> 59:30.500
I have to admit, I'm not that excited about the track list either, Dark Knight.

59:30.500 --> 59:35.380
There's some songs that made me go, woohoo, but a lot of it kind of makes me go, hmm.

59:35.380 --> 59:36.660
Not really a memorable song.

59:36.660 --> 59:39.620
But what to you makes a song list great?

59:39.620 --> 59:41.980
Convince us we're wrong.

59:41.980 --> 59:42.980
Give me Stairway.

59:42.980 --> 59:45.300
I mean, Turn the Japanese might be one.

59:45.300 --> 59:48.780
But if I had the power to add a song, give me Stairway to Heaven.

59:48.780 --> 59:49.860
I know exactly.

59:49.860 --> 59:52.860
No stairway denied.

59:52.860 --> 59:53.860
I know.

59:53.860 --> 59:54.860
Wow.

59:54.860 --> 59:55.860
All right.

59:55.860 --> 59:56.860
Dark Knight, we've got to let you go.

59:56.860 --> 59:58.860
Any last thoughts real quick?

59:58.860 --> 01:00:04.500
Um, also, um, you need to start playing PSU again because, um, well, that's why you have

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.500
360.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.500
You probably already got it.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.700
But they recently gave out Sonic statues.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.700
Really?

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.700
Everybody.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.500
No, God, I haven't touched the game in forever, but I think my membership is still active

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.500
and I'm paying for it.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.060
I just haven't gone into the game in forever.

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.060
So we'll see.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.180
Yeah, everybody got a Sonic statue now.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.180
It's you know what?

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.020
I pull me away from World of Warcraft, seriously.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.540
And I feel like I know I'm going to get so much hate mail, like Rob, play a real game.

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:32.260
But I can't explain how addicting this game is and it's the social end of it completely

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.180
because of the fact that a lot of my friends play it.

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.620
It's not even really the game itself that I'm in love with.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:38.620
I'm in love with Ventrilo.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.620
That's my problem.

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:46.740
I'm not going to go into detail about the Ventrilo thing, but I mean, it is right now

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:52.100
the game is just, I think it's kind of winding down now because the expansion is coming.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.340
Well I, it'll be, hopefully, hopefully the expansion will give it a good badly needed

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:58.460
kick in the pants because I would like to get back into some PSU.

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:06.900
Anyway, quick plug for my show because I do a show on This is Genius Radio, Dark Knight

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:11.700
Ninja Dojo on Thursday nights, welcome to join if you like, basically going to be talking

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.700
about this week, the iPhone.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.860
Ooh, iPhone.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:15.860
I saw one this week.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.860
They're very pretty.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.260
Well I will try to tune in and I think I'm supposed to be on the show this week or very

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.260
soon.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.260
Yes?

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.260
Yes.

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.260
Yes.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:28.460
I just have to double check my personal calendar, but I should be there.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.460
Okay.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.460
All right.

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:31.460
That's it.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.460
All right.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.460
Take care, buddy.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.460
Thanks for calling.

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.460
Bye, folks.

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.460
All right.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:40.580
Dark Knight here on Orange Launch Radio and everybody's got their own show these days.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:41.580
I swear to God.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.580
I swear to God.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.580
No, it's all good though.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.580
I like Dark Knight.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.580
Hi, you're on.

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:50.220
I'm going to punch that guy in the face.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.220
You know who you are.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.220
Punch him in the ass.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.220
You told me you fixed it.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.500
Now that's another edit.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.140
Ah, forget it.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.140
I'm not going to edit that out.

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.020
Podcast listeners, you guys can deal with it.

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.020
Way to be lazy.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.020
That was DMN, by the way.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:08.100
If you want to hate somebody for blowing your ears out, that was Insanist, DMN, whatever

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.500
the hell your name is right now.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.500
Love you.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.500
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.500
Who's this?

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.500
Mushy Mushy.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.500
Mushy Mushy?

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.500
No, it's relevant.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.500
Oh, like you're saying hello.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:26.140
I hear myself.

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.140
It's okay.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.140
Sometimes there is a bit of an echo.

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.140
Identify yourself, please.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:30.140
Nintendo Maniac 64.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.140
Nintendo Maniac 64.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.140
What's on your mind, my friend?

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.140
Well, dealing with the Japanese thing.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.140
What was it?

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.140
You got a letter.

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:36.140
Is this your first Japanese listener on the show?

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:37.140
Is that a letter in the book?

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.140
No, I think Peekers.

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.140
Peekers.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.140
Peekers.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.140
Peekers.

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:42.140
Peekers.

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.140
Peekers.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.140
Peekers.

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.140
Peekers.

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.140
Peekers.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.140
Peekers.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:51.100
And also I think Peeker Uno is also in Japan from my following him on Twitter.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.420
Because I actually have a Twitter account.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.000
And some of the listeners have me added on there as Sky on Twitter.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.820
And I picked up the He's in Japan.

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.740
Who is the really Japanese, though?

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:06.100
I haven't the foggiest idea, but I'm sure I'm going to get a Twitter about it now.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.420
The message is Japanese.

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.320
Actually, I've looked at the statistics.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.700
We do have some Japanese listeners.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.220
We have listeners all over the world, just not all of them are vocal.

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.220
But I understand.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:20.700
lot of effort to write an email so I you know no expectations but I don't think

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:24.940
this guy's the first one but he's the first email I can recall getting from

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:31.100
Japan but we have had emails from other parts of Asia okay so other than that

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:37.580
uh oh yeah you know I returned out earlier with the it was like a bad were

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.580
some wording that one like brain-age knockoff game or something yeah mind

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:46.900
quiz yeah did you see the image link that said you had the actual the phrase

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.860
and stuff in it I did thank you so yes we did find out and confirm that the

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:55.860
word is well I can't say it because it's bad spastic oh my god Loki now we're

01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:00.940
gonna have to put an explicit tag on the show you bastard ah so I don't know

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.220
well I don't know cuz culturally over here that's not really a bad word but I

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:08.500
suppose you know if the game had called me a fag I may not like wait you know

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:13.260
who we could ask wait no wait where's a bad word in England yes we can ask

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:17.340
station I think he's listening I don't see him in not listening to your show

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:20.660
sleeping is red kind of late over there in Britain right now so we don't have a

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:25.100
lot of I'll ask him all right you do that call him a spastic and sees what

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:31.580
happens oh no you might make me number two on his myspace anyway I love how

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:36.060
rice princess biggest concern in the world is that OMG I might get demoted in

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:40.900
the top eight on myspace yeah pretty much get a life woman I can't with my

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:45.780
they're gonna happen you know you're instantly well orange launch radio has a

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.980
myspace so I can't I can't complain too much all right internal maniac anything

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:53.740
else on your mind yeah I finally finally got time splitters to I've been trying

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:59.580
to find it forever I got it and that smashing glass level it's like but I got

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:04.020
golden in like I think like an hour or something like what you think like how

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:07.980
it gets really hard like it gets harder as you pass through some of the levels

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.900
in there what exactly do you do in this level well there's like they have

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.180
different levels like breaking stuff usually it'll be with a brick or

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:18.700
something and you have to smash windows and you have to throw a brick through it

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:28.380
and it's it's pretty hard you have to go through and other way all right well

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.860
we're gonna go ahead and let you go buddy but thanks so much for giving us

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:37.540
a call and enjoy time splitters okay yeah all right black later but all right

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:40.940
well that's gonna do it tonight for the skype line sorry to those calls we

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:45.540
didn't get to we did have a lot of calls coming through but we have a lot we've

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:49.780
been on the air quite a while now we got to wrap things up so let's go around now

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.100
since there's no last-minute stories we're gonna go around and get everybody

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.980
no no that's not the case oh you found something of course I was taking the

01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:02.420
time to pull up the stories go for it and the rumor is apparently beautiful

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:05.180
katamari is gonna be skipping the PlayStation 3 and going straight to the

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:12.420
Wii and it's supposed to be coming out next year on the Wii I'll be honest

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:17.100
though I would say it's coming out in both fiscal year 2008 that's just my

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:23.860
guess though didn't you get in trouble for that once before no I'm guessing I

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.700
don't know okay but I would if I were to guess I would say it's coming fiscal

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:33.420
year I honestly don't give a fuck anymore I sure I don't give a fuck let

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:37.020
the game come out wherever it's gonna come out and maybe I'll buy it if it's

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:42.260
not just a copy of the first game exactly um anyways so some other stuff

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:48.140
that's gonna be interesting this was kind of a surprise to me although this

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:53.060
is one of the only films of his I'm gonna go see postal is being being

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:57.580
called what the hell my microphone went out there for a second no I turned the

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.980
audio and sorry you're fine anyways postal is being called one of the best

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:08.180
films and apparently it got standing ovations at cans which is very

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:14.740
surprising but um I don't know everybody at the can film festival is on ecstasy

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:21.300
apparently it says anyways it says we've all calls it his final statement he says

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:25.700
you can make you can't make a more radical movie there is no way you can

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:30.140
ignore postal it's one of the funniest and most important films of lack of the

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:34.580
last decade it is one of the best films of all times of course this is a wee

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.220
bull talking about himself were they giving it a standing ovation because they

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:41.980
got to leave maybe I don't know I think it looks cheesy I know it's gonna be

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:48.060
offensive that's you know that's it a dark tetsuya says or was a way bold just

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:53.780
dreaming the whole thing yeah he might have been some other interesting stuff

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.980
on game that's been announced to be coming to the Wii is called the blob

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:03.020
which apparently is going to be kind of similar it was a there was actually a

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:06.700
contest it was involved a student project it's kind of a cross between

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.700
katamari and I guess I don't know you paint buildings with this giant blob of

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:15.000
paint and roll it around and stuff so it looks kind of neat will the game also

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:24.060
feature a boy no so it can be a boy in his blob get it yeah I got oh my god and

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:28.580
then real quick some of the virtual console games coming out here in the

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:32.280
next few weeks at least it's her graphic 16 stuff this ought to make Christopher

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:37.480
happy but let's see it's got to be devil's devil's crush I knew it

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:43.220
