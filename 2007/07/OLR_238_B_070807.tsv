487	19091	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19927	20187	E3's going on!
35986	44369	And of course, as we talked about in Part A, one of the things that Sony is most likely going to be announcing at E3 is a $100 price drop for the PlayStation 3.
44689	50971	However, as we do record the show live on Sunday nights, sometimes things change as the show is going on.
51031	51612	Yes, Loki?
52212	53952	Yes, it's not a secret anymore.
54173	55293	It is official.
55733	62756	They have announced that the PlayStation 3 will be dropping, or I should say the PlayStation 3 68 system will be dropping to $499.
64558	65939	Um, actually this week.
66539	75285	The other announcement, though, is coming in August, they're going to be releasing the 80 gig model that's going to be also bundled with a retail copy of Motorstorm.
75765	78787	That is going to be at the $5.99 price point.
78927	82349	So, you know, everybody loves that $5.99 price point.
82409	86252	But at least it's nice to see that they're bundling a game in there as well.
87412	87733	I don't know.
88173	91695	A little bit more for your money, but still, not a whole lot.
92550	98474	That's probably going to be announced again at E3 and during Sony's so-called press conference.
99675	101796	Just thought we'd like to let you guys know about that.
102757	103878	Now on to other things.
104018	119108	Of course with E3 right around the corner, one thing that we loved last year, and they're doing it again, is Microsoft is going to be doing that Bring It Home thing where they actually have videos and demos from the show floor almost.
119168	120469	Last year we got to play
121062	123864	Test Drive Unlimited, and MotoGP 2006.
125446	127247	And there was one other one in there.
127267	127587	I don't know.
128468	128988	Fun stuff.
129349	139216	So this year, though, who knows what we're going to get, but we're going to get more of that, more demos, more game trailers and stuff like that, more free themes, hopefully.
139997	140137	And...
141741	143602	Also, they're not the only ones doing that.
143742	150845	This year, Sony is jumping on the bandwagon, so they say, and are going to be doing something very similar on the PlayStation Network as well.
150865	154647	You're going to have downloadable demos and videos and whatnot.
155088	156748	So, awesome.
156848	160330	I can't wait to download new demos because I like playing demos.
161210	167734	Do you think, and just indulge me here as silly as this thought might be, do you think that Microsoft might pull out a price drop of their own?
167754	169454	Possibly.
169955	170455	Possibly.
171232	174394	I, I, they're not gonna just be like, do-do-do-do-do, you know, whatever.
174734	189882	I don't think they need to, but, you know, now that Sony dropped their price, they might pull that thing where, where we think that our price point, you know, even though it's, it's $399, is still competitive with their price point, but they might be going by the leads, still, even though their leads are $20 less, supposedly.
189902	189942	Um,
192261	195243	Do you think they might throw in a free game or something to make the deal more lucrative?
221659	235901	SSJ100 Matt says not till after Halo 3 comes out would there be another price drop they very well might hold it off until after Halo comes out and just say boom here you go price drop let's sell some systems
236581	237362	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
255915	261837	Eternal Sonata had a demo come out already but Blue Dragon will be getting a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace July 20th.
263097	271780	There is a Dengeki Online magazine in Japan that is claiming that a 1.1 gigabyte demo is going to be coming out over here in the US on July 20th.
272100	275541	It's going to be a two hour demo if this story is correct.
275601	277742	It's going to be a pretty intense demo.
278622	281003	It's only going to be available though for two weeks.
281063	283003	The demo will disappear on August 3rd.
283384	284564	So now it almost sounds like it's like a
285509	289653	Beta test or something, even though it's not an online game, so I don't know what the hell else to call it.
289673	290794	It's a limited time demo.
291094	291715	Kind of interesting.
292055	296379	It's just an incentive for you to play it, I guess.
296399	297760	But a two hour demo?
297820	298120	Really?
299842	303866	That sounds like a really good idea, especially if the game is going to be a bunch longer than that.
304326	308350	If they're trying to give a percentage of the game to get an idea of it.
308470	311933	It is supposed to be one of the first Xbox 360 games that's on two discs.
312677	313037	Interesting.
313338	321904	Well, and you know, and then I also think about, you know, your typical Xbox early adopter is not someone who's typically into these type of Japanese RPGs.
321944	329810	Because, you know, a lot of folks who have not picked up an Xbox 360 still, they do like these games and aren't impressed with the fact that Microsoft doesn't have them out.
330110	338256	But maybe having a very long two-hour demo is kind of a way to show these folks who maybe bought their Xboxes for the Maddens and burnouts of the world.
339470	344672	Give them their really first experience in a Japanese RPG and try to get some people sucked into the world through that.
344732	345672	I don't know, just a thought.
345793	357477	You know, to kind of go back a little bit, with the whole PlayStation Network doing almost like the bring it home thing, I really do hope they do this because lately their downloads and stuff and their content online has been pretty crappy.
358057	365420	I mean, and if they start kicking it up to maybe the Xbox Live level, that would be pretty awesome and that would definitely help them.
366664	372566	Because I know right now the 360, there's no shortage of new demos and games coming out each week.
374947	381329	All right, well, I will definitely be looking forward to the Blue Dragon demo, and I'll be downloading it, I'm sure, as a lot of you folks listening to the show will be.
382189	394354	Well, speaking of Xbox news, the Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be launched in Japan on October 11th.
395450	401155	And the price is going to be 47,800 yen, which in US dollars is 390.
402676	404277	So they're getting it cheaper than we did.
406079	407000	Good for them, I guess.
407500	411803	Well, I guess they need to be selling more Xboxes over in Japan, so why not release it cheap, eh?
412084	412744	They're trying.
413465	413825	All right.
414225	418349	Well, if you're in Japan and you've been holding out for an Xbox 360, maybe now's the time.
418369	418649	Who knows?
419570	419730	Well...
420376	421357	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
444443	448727	Now, the only problem, though, is the PlayStation 3 version has been delayed indefinitely.
449027	454211	So, the Xbox 360 one will be arriving September 11th on my birthday.
454371	454611	Awesome.
455232	461057	And PlayStation 3 will possibly later on if it's not cancelled by then.
462678	463359	Very interesting.
463599	465400	I mean, there's been plenty of games like this.
465460	471245	Splinter Cell, Double Agent, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, hell, Rainbow Six Vegas.
472366	472426	It
472711	476673	Just kind of continuing the trend that the PlayStation 3 is hard to develop for.
479455	484998	This is very interesting, kind of taking another topic here from Xbox 360 World.
485538	489440	Forza 2, you can create your own cars in Forza 2, right?
489941	494063	And you can create these cars and you can actually sell them in their little online auction.
494103	497605	Well, I'm surprised it took this long for a story like this to come out.
498154	498554	www.DarkSakura.com
515390	516010	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
537256	540217	Not, you know, a giant twat on the hood of a car or something.
540237	541737	It's all sorts of offensive things.
542097	544637	Fuck me in the butt, like written on the side of the car.
545217	548198	I mean, this is just the tip of the iceberg, folks.
548338	551819	So how exactly do you stop this from happening?
552199	554759	Does a set of eyes have to look at every car that goes up?
555099	560040	Do you just allow this kind of shit to go on there and hope that people will warn or whatever they need to do?
560060	564581	What you need to do is they should have something, you know, report abuse or report, you know,
565367	567168	This is a fence, you know, something like that.
567628	573749	You know, if it's, do you think if it's breaking, you know, the terms of service or whatever, have it be reported and then they can take it down.
574389	575290	You know, kind of like eBay.
576490	585232	You know, and of course, Microsoft has their whole little online user policy that says you won't use our services to discriminate against, you know, somebody for a race or whatever.
585492	594715	Even though whenever you sign on to Xbox Live and you play some online game, it's usually, you know, NNNNFFFF and all those, you know, words getting dropped everywhere.
595390	596050	Like crazy.
597391	603394	Part of the charm, and I say that with over sarcasm there, the charm of Xbox Live.
603414	605315	That's why I only play Xbox Live with friends.
605875	608137	I very rarely will play Xbox Live with strangers.
608537	609997	And I rate every single one of them too.
610037	612119	If I play Xbox Live with strangers, they get rated by me.
612599	612979	Every time.
613119	614160	I rate them good or I rate them bad.
616481	622764	It'll be interesting to see if Sony, what Sony does in their whole future plan for online gaming as well.
624588	626409	Well, other stuff.
627089	627289	Yes.
628250	628470	Yes.
629270	632011	Other stuff has to do with Gears of War, the soundtrack.
633992	645417	Apparently the game is so popular that they are releasing the score to the game on soundtrack, you know, with tracks such as Train Ride to Hell.
647318	653361	Wow, if I'd known there were more songs like that in Gears of War, I might have tried to play it longer, although it was kind of frustrating me like crazy.
654722	655222	You know what?
655343	658465	They've been doing soundtracks to video games for years in Japan.
659065	660947	And we're just now getting all this goodness.
661647	662788	Just in recent years.
663089	663909	We've had some.
663969	665430	Like, you'll get, like, spotty, really.
665470	667212	Like, Gran Turismo 2 had a soundtrack.
667252	667812	I remember that.
668112	669674	We do get the Silent Hill soundtracks over here.
669894	672716	Yeah, they're very spotty, but you see them once in a while.
672736	679101	But, of course, I think in Japan, my God, like, every role-playing game that's major come out of there has a deluxe soundtrack that comes out five disc long.
679421	680381	Chrono Trigger soundtrack.
680401	683382	With art books attached to them, like my Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack.
684143	687104	Kind of interesting that over here you get a Gears of War soundtrack.
687124	689004	But, you know, the game's still insanely popular.
689044	690265	It's always in that top ten list.
690285	691845	I'm glad that they're doing this, though.
691885	692145	Oh, yeah.
692425	695186	There's games come out where I'd be like, well, I really want the music to this.
695506	700848	And, you know, I've actually got the new whatever Mana game just came out soundtrack.
700988	705150	Or how about like Grand Theft Auto, you know, Vice City.
705470	708851	But that was all like actual, you know, radio music.
709360	711922	That's sad that they never came out with a box set for Grand Theft Auto 3.
711982	716005	That had some pretty good stuff, especially on that techno trance station that they had on there.
716606	721770	I think that iTunes also opens the doors for a lot of this, too, because there's more and more game music on iTunes lately.
721790	731297	I know we had a story a few weeks ago about how Konami put a lot of their old classic songs up there, so it's kind of neat what you can find online and shopping online as well.
732833	733613	Thanks for watching!
750066	758369	Somebody got a response back from Microsoft saying that the surge protector was the cause of the Red Rings of Death.
758769	763210	And the reason, because the 360 is highly sensitive to reductions in power.
763370	768952	Even the slightest cut in power can cause things like the fans and DVD laser to malfunction.
769972	778935	Surge protectors can cause this, and probably 90% of the consoles they've seen fail in the 6-12 months of being plugged into a surge protector.
779842	780902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
808725	811026	Microsoft's response to the whole Red Rings of Death thing.
811046	811886	But first, a game.
811966	812666	Let's play a game.
813106	816587	It's a little bit of a slow news week, thanks to E3 being right around the corner.
816608	820589	I mean, there has been some big news this week as things start to leak out before E3.
820909	822749	But during a slow news week, we like to play a game.
822809	825390	So tonight, we're going to play a little bit of Listless.
827411	827991	Listless
829239	835062	And the way that listless works, you guys, we're going to be creating the definitive list around a certain topic.
835302	837483	And the three hosts here in studio are going to play.
837763	838843	And Jonas is here with us.
838863	843665	We haven't heard a lot from him this segment, but he's been sitting here in studio with us, joined us during Part A. He's here with us.
843685	844626	How are you doing, Jonas?
844686	845406	Doing fine, and you?
845426	846267	All right, very good.
846387	848227	Explicit, also known as in the online world.
848408	850168	And you're going to be going to SAC Anime this weekend, too.
850208	851469	Yes, of course.
851949	855031	Talk to you guys about SakAnime, I'm not sure if you guys are going to be able to make it.
855271	858514	We'll be there, we don't know about the panel yet though, so let us know.
858554	860515	I'll try my best to get you to get the panel there.
860635	865778	For the whole three people in Sacramento to listen to this program, because this is a worldwide show, but we're hoping to get more, that's why we're going.
866199	867960	I can help promote this stuff.
868100	869201	Alright, sounds awesome.
869661	878267	Alright, well anyway, we'll talk about that later, but tonight we're going to talk about Listless, and tonight's topic is the most random thing we'd like to see at E3 this year.
878287	878387	Okay.
879063	880124	This is how it's going to work.
880184	884869	You can do serious things, crazy things, stupid things.
885149	886391	There is no limitation.
886611	888112	You can be serious, you can be stupid.
888152	891416	It doesn't matter because ultimately it will be in the hands of the chatroom.
891756	896341	The way this is going to work, I will name my top three, as will DarkSakura, Loki, and Exquisite.
899406	900227	It could be anything.
900407	904471	It could be an event, something that happens at a press conference, or it could be a game that's announced or whatever.
905051	909656	So anyway, chat room, if you'd like to make some suggestions, you can start yelling those out in chat.
909896	915601	But chat, you will actually play an important part because once we name our three lists, then the fun part comes.
915621	919705	We're going to go around and each one of us will take something off of the list.
920225	922147	So that's going to leave us with a list of eight.
922788	925070	In chat room, you're going to vote for your favorites.
925649	928670	and we will come up with a definitive list based on the chat room vote.
928710	929791	That's how Listless works.
931572	934193	This is an old game we used to do years ago on my college radio show.
934253	935293	It's lasted this long.
936194	941556	Anyway, so again the topic tonight, the most random thing we'd like to see at E3 this year.
941576	941957	It doesn't matter.
941977	946299	It can be serious, stupid, whatever you want because the chat room will ultimately decide what it's going to be.
946819	947739	So let's start it off.
948219	949480	Explicit, you're our guest tonight.
949520	950420	Why don't you start us off?
950440	953682	What would be the third most random thing you'd like to see at E3 this year?
955416	956757	Bill Gates getting pied in the face?
975373	977074	Well, I mean, that's happened before, okay.
977434	980555	And you know how everyone's talking about the red rings of death.
980775	985137	Oh, so you think someone will, like, you know, maybe a cherry pie to put a red ring of death on his face?
985257	985617	Yes.
985697	988218	Actually, I shouldn't say that, because somebody's going to totally misinterpret that.
988758	992800	We don't mean someone should actually do this, but it would be kind of... It might happen.
992960	993380	Come on.
993740	995161	Pies in the face are funny.
995281	997322	That's what Bozo the Clown used to do.
997962	998262	All right.
999142	1001623	But if you actually do it, it's your ass that's going to jail.
1002064	1002724	All right, anyhow...
1003617	1008059	Loki, if you would, your number three thing you would most like to see happen at E3?
1008920	1013202	Nintendo actually releases online games, or games that are online.
1016363	1020285	Nintendo actually releases an online game to the shock and awe of many.
1020325	1023707	We knew, oh god, it was inevitable somebody was going to drop that one on us.
1024747	1026628	Alright, say no more.
1026688	1032511	Alright, let's see, I'm going to go next, because we'll save the best for last, Jamie.
1035717	1042741	Alright, my number three thing I would like to see happen at E3, I would like to see Sega publicly apologize for what they did to the Sonic franchise.
1043581	1046563	I would like to see Sega have a press conference and go, look, our bad.
1047083	1048084	So that's my number three thing.
1050785	1052206	Um, my number three.
1053327	1053747	If you're ready.
1054588	1056329	I am, I was just typing that into the computer.
1056389	1058090	Sega publicly apologize for Sonic.
1058130	1058550	Alright, yes.
1058930	1060571	Pyramid Head showing up killing everyone from G4.
1069369	1069770	Lovely.
1069870	1073714	So Pyramid Head will come in there with his sexy self and kill everyone from G4.
1073995	1078821	Not really, because again, we don't want to get sued or watched by the FBI or anything.
1078861	1084648	We don't really mean that, but Pyramid Head could come in there and lay the smack down.
1085169	1086170	This is silly or random.
1087492	1088413	I hope the chatroom liked it.
1088433	1089994	TheRobD says, that is pretty random.
1090454	1091375	All right.
1091815	1095237	Jonas, your number two most random thing you'd like to see happen at E3.
1095418	1095818	All right.
1096258	1096618	Okay.
1097559	1101822	I have the sense of this because Jamie said the person is banned in Orange Downs Radio.
1102082	1103403	All right.
1104424	1107986	If the initials are JT... Who shall not be named?
1108006	1109307	You can use that or Voldemort.
1110708	1111949	Him showing up at E3.
1113550	1115672	So, Voldemort attends E3.
1121496	1122376	That would be pretty random.
1122396	1123597	What would he be doing at E3?
1123617	1127758	Because you know the rumor is he was going to go to Penny Arcade Expo, but they couldn't work out an agreement there.
1127878	1129918	So what would Lord Voldemort be doing at E3?
1130719	1131059	Who knows?
1131099	1133539	He'll probably try to censor as many games as possible.
1133579	1134860	He'd be carrying the pie.
1135680	1136300	That's what it is.
1136320	1137220	That's what will happen.
1137861	1138481	All right, there you go.
1138921	1141542	Loki, your number two most random thing you'd like to see happen at E3?
1141882	1146183	This is less of what I... This is more than likely going to happen.
1146887	1149309	Um, because, you know, stupid things come out each year.
1149689	1152471	But more crappy games announced based off TV series.
1153872	1158735	Like, uh, Dancing with the Stars, or, um, God, I don't know.
1159435	1160856	Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
1161116	1162217	Hey, Paula, the game.
1162617	1166400	Hey, Paula, the game.
1166440	1169662	God, if there is a God in heaven, please do not make this happen.
1170402	1171263	Hey, Paula, the game.
1172277	1172758	Let's see.
1172898	1175361	My number two thing I would like to see happen at E3.
1175861	1180927	I would like to see Nintendo not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.
1181247	1182909	That's what I'd like to see happen for once at E3.
1182929	1186693	I'd like to see Nintendo not announce one of their systems out in a new color.
1187113	1188255	I think that's self-explanatory.
1188375	1188655	Jamie?
1189656	1193080	Number two should be we be invited to be the official E3 podcasters.
1197128	1198729	So Jamie's showing a little bit of ego there.
1198849	1203291	OLR, the official ambassadors to the podcasting universe for E3.
1203512	1206313	So I'm going to put OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors.
1206333	1206693	Is that good?
1208474	1209515	And why would they pick us?
1211036	1212237	Because of my boobs?
1212297	1212657	I don't know.
1217139	1219641	So then ambassadors with emphasis on the ass.
1219801	1221342	Whatever.
1221522	1221882	Whatever.
1223058	1225900	Alright, OLR sells out at E3 08.
1226620	1231682	Alright, number one, the number one thing you would like to see happen at E3 this year.
1232863	1233323	Explicit.
1233623	1238966	Okay, this might get me a little hated here, but Halo 3 delayed or cancelled.
1239947	1242488	Halo 3 delayed or cancelled, that would be pretty funny.
1242508	1248051	This would be funny, I wanted to see what the fans would say about this if they say it was delayed.
1249125	1256290	I don't actually see it, but remember, this is random or whatever you want, so this is your little sick fantasy is that you want to see the Halo fanboys have a cry.
1256991	1259653	Loki, the number one thing you would like to see happen at E3 this year?
1259673	1262314	This honestly is something I really hope to see.
1263435	1265557	Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.
1267238	1268319	And it actually sticks.
1271181	1274423	Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced, or they could come out and say it's out today.
1275724	1278626	Oh my god, if they did that on Xbox Live Arcade, oh
1280081	1308683	that would be awesome my number one thing is that I would like to see at E3 all the old Kensha Hall exhibitors picketing outside the auditorium or how about like you know pickaxes and torches just there chanting hell no we won't go and all that stuff alright Jamie your number one thing Skye's voice the game
1312059	1315620	Please explain this classic Oelarian joke for the sake of our new listeners.
1316661	1321343	It was Rob singing Bumblebee with different lyrics.
1322183	1324264	So Konami announces Sky's voice the game.
1324424	1324644	Yeah.
1325184	1326825	It's their latest in their Bomani series.
1326865	1327185	Thank you.
1327225	1328266	My ego feels good for that.
1328906	1329706	All right, there we go.
1329766	1332647	So let's recap the big list we have here.
1333148	1334308	This is very wordy, you guys.
1334328	1338570	You might have to kind of lean in a little bit to see this, but I'll make the font bigger there so we can all read.
1338590	1341311	Let me just kind of make that nice and...
1342062	1347405	E3 2007 Pi Bill Gates in the face Nintendo actually releases an online game Sega publicly apologizes for Sonic
1370481	1372622	PyramidHead shows up and kills everyone from G4.
1374802	1376523	Lord Voldemort goes to E3.
1377143	1380744	More crappy games based off of TV series like Hey Paula the Game.
1381424	1385025	Nintendo not announces one of their systems coming out in a new color.
1386266	1389407	OLR is named E3 Podcasting Ambassadors.
1390287	1392568	Halo 3 is delayed or cancelled.
1393828	1396149	Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.
1396709	1400110	Kensha Hall's exhibitors picket outside the theater.
1400734	1404917	and Konami announces Sky's Voice the game as the latest in the Bomani series.
1404977	1408720	It's a pretty good list, but unfortunately this list is not perfect.
1409500	1412843	So we need to go around and take ones off the list.
1412903	1415725	So, Explicit, we'll start with you.
1415805	1418707	Which one of these items is not worthy of being on the list?
1419628	1422149	They're all good, but... This is hard tonight.
1422169	1422870	This is hard tonight.
1423310	1423891	This is hard.
1423991	1424191	Hmm...
1429955	1431116	Oh, man.
1431696	1435318	I guess I'll have to play the little dance music while Jonas thinks there.
1435338	1441180	I'll have to go with Nintendo and not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.
1441200	1445002	Because you know it's inevitable that's actually going to happen, right?
1445102	1445622	Yeah.
1446023	1446443	All right.
1446503	1451385	So, Explicit takes out the line about Nintendo will not actually... Whatever.
1451585	1451945	It's gone.
1451965	1453286	It doesn't matter anymore.
1453386	1455747	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
1457208	1457308	Um...
1460758	1461179	No.
1463761	1465063	Bill Gates getting pied in the face.
1465103	1467826	Bill Gates is normally not really at these events too much.
1467926	1470368	If it was like Peter Moore getting pied in the face, maybe.
1471009	1471329	I don't know.
1472391	1472751	All right.
1473332	1473792	Let's see.
1473912	1475374	What would I like to put off the list?
1475854	1477136	I am going to pull off the list.
1477176	1480179	I'm going to pull off Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.
1481192	1485413	because, come on, it's the laughing stock of the industry, and we can't have that ruined at E3 this year.
1485433	1488194	It was a good thought, but this is just hard.
1488234	1488914	It's a hard list.
1489014	1491375	It's a hard list, so Jamie gets the last remove.
1491395	1492715	What are you going to take off the list?
1493215	1496556	He shall not be named showing up at E3 because it ain't going to happen.
1496576	1497277	Yeah, we wouldn't want that.
1497297	1500077	It's invite only, bitch, and you weren't invited.
1500938	1502158	You don't get to crash this party.
1502850	1505473	All right, incoming large paste into chat.
1505774	1509438	You guys are going to vote for your top two, your number one and your number two.
1509498	1510780	The order is important.
1510820	1512842	I will assume your first answer is the number one.
1513062	1517287	You're going to send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
1518128	1520892	Real quick, sorry, this is kind of an afterthought, but nonetheless.
1521493	1533069	It'd be funny to see the people at Gamecock, the ones doing the EIEIO thing, to actually have a Trojan rooster come to the E3 thing and try to see if they can get him to put it in there.
1534351	1535233	And everyone will jump out and...
1537698	1539880	Here are our finalists for tonight's list list.
1539900	1542302	We're going to open up voting to the chat room right now.
1542562	1544403	Vote for your number one and number two picks.
1544423	1547906	We'll tally them up during the next few stories and reveal the answers to you later in the show.
1547946	1548347	Here we go.
1548427	1549788	Things we'd like to see at E3 07.
1550148	1552230	Nintendo actually releases an online game.
1552670	1555232	Sega publicly apologizes for what they did to Sonic.
1555633	1558095	Pyramid Head shows up and kills everyone from G4.
1558615	1560977	More crappy games based off of TV series.
1561498	1564020	OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors.
1564580	1570569	Halo 3, Delayed or Cancelled, Kensha Hall Exhibitors, Pickett Outside the Theater, Sky's Voice the Game.
1570709	1571891	Why didn't I take that off the list?
1572292	1574935	Sky's Voice the Game, announced by Konami.
1575837	1576578	All right, there you have it.
1576638	1579202	Let's get back into the gaming news while the votes come in.
1579727	1581249	Gold Farmers are a pain in your ass
1595027	1620805	and Blizzard did a good job with their latest patch though they really managed to squelch the amount of spam that was going out thanks to the limitations they made on trial accounts but that just means the gold farmers have gotten a little more creative I am actually still getting tell spam once in a great while from gold farmers but it's gone way down but this has got to be one of the most creative things we've seen in a long time and that is that these folks now are creating level 1 gnome characters and
1621225	1648466	and killing themselves in the main alliance town of Ironforge and spelling out the name of their website I'm not going to read the name of the website but you can see pictures around the internet all these corpses laid out in like .com such and such site I don't want to plug the site because they're cunts for doing this to the game and need to just stay the hell out of the game but you have to give them props at least for being creative why can't we see this kind of advertising in real life
1649019	1657089	Blizzard, by the way, one of their reps wrote on their own forums, I ask that any player that witnesses these to report them straight away.
1657569	1663617	If you feel so inclined, you can also post the realm name and zone here, and I can see what can be done about getting them handled that way.
1664912	1667113	Please, once it's reported, leave the bodies alone.
1667133	1669353	Do not linger around or huddle near the bodies.
1669413	1671974	In other words, don't give them the attention that they're looking for.
1672634	1677035	Apparently, I read somewhere else, somebody actually caught one of these midway through.
1677555	1679115	It stopped.
1679155	1681316	You just see all these bodies saying .com.
1682116	1686117	You don't see the rest of the site name because I guess the Blizzard folks banned the IPs for too long.
1686477	1688617	Kind of a creative way to get around.
1688657	1690058	If nothing else, it's very creative.
1690138	1692298	I'll give them that, even if they are annoying as hell.
1693585	1696127	Going to the chat room, James Patrick says, That's awesome.
1696187	1697848	Dead body advertising is great.
1698588	1703111	Sephiroth1215 says, Yeah, it kind of sucks, but for those sad lives of WoW players, it is really funny.
1703432	1703892	Hey, wait a minute.
1703912	1704813	That's me you're talking about.
1705273	1705553	Jerk.
1706614	1708455	All right, more news while I tally votes.
1711044	1722315	Well, for anyone who plays Second Life, apparently there is now going to be a build of Tokyo in Second Life done by Tetsuya Mizuguchi.
1722795	1727180	He's doing actually a reimagined Tokyo for the...
1730191	1731993	I'm trying to actually get a little bit more on that.
1732273	1737197	Right, they're doing, actually completely recreated Tokyo from what it's saying.
1737537	1745124	He wants to do what Tokyo appears to both locals and visitors, something that's a matter of perception.
1747245	1749727	He's quoted actually saying a museum of Japanese pop culture.
1751129	1753450	So, yeah.
1753831	1754591	Kind of interesting.
1754611	1755472	I'd like to see how that turns out.
1755492	1757614	Even though I don't really want to play Second Life.
1759280	1762283	Anyways, interesting thing also coming to PCs.
1762703	1766947	Dead or Alive Online is coming to PCs pretty soon.
1767608	1771591	And it's supposed to be a brand new game in the series.
1771651	1773333	It won't just be some stupid port.
1774294	1783702	And so yeah, you will be able to see the Dead or Alive jubblies, I guess, bouncing up and down on your PC in high res.
1784483	1784863	Hooray.
1786535	1787596	But you like that, yes?
1787976	1789356	Oh yeah, don't get me wrong.
1789596	1790056	It's awesome.
1790396	1803221	Unfortunately, since it is on PC, it's been done before by other companies, and they've actually had it where you can strip clothes off of people and stuff while you're fighting in the game.
1805039	1813969	Well, hey, you know, this Dead or Alive game, of course, you know, there's a lot of Dead or Alive games on the Xbox 360, but thanks to the Red Rings of Death, some folks have not been able to play them.
1814049	1824100	Well, you know, the internet threw a fit, even the UK was starting to investigate Microsoft, and finally Microsoft this week said, alright, enough, we fucked up, we're sorry.
1824764	1825865	Peter Moore came out and said
1839059	1844162	to address specifically the general hardware failures indicated by the three flashing red lights on the console.
1844523	1846984	This applies to new and previously sold consoles.
1847324	1852588	So in other words, for three years, and the Xbox 360 hasn't even been out that long yet, your console's covered.
1852608	1855370	If you get the three rings of death, you don't have to pay to have it fixed.
1855970	1858312	That means all the people who bought extended warranties
1859625	1861045	Well, they may cover other failures.
1861065	1862946	This is only for the three red rings of death.
1862966	1866867	So the extended warranty does cover all the other things that could go wrong.
1866907	1870528	But certainly, a lot of folks are applauding Microsoft for this move.
1870588	1873949	Now, it would be nice if the three red rings of death would never show up in the first place.
1874529	1880331	But since Microsoft can't magically cure all the 360s that are already out there, I suppose this is the next best thing.
1880471	1885233	Any thoughts from the folks here in studio on the whole warranty policy change?
1885253	1886313	I think it's pretty cool.
1887654	1890916	I'm glad to see that they're actually covering this stuff anyways.
1891417	1903745	And then hopefully, I'm assuming since the rumor's been going around that they're redesigning the cooling on it, that this will fix the problem and any of these consoles that are still out there that are failing because of this will get fixed.
1904226	1905587	And we won't have to hear about it anymore.
1906067	1910010	Apparently Peter Moore has actually joined our chat room or someone impersonating him.
1910070	1914233	Peter Moore says, we're sorry, have this three year warranty for the three red lights.
1915093	1916474	See, one year for every light.
1916494	1917255	There you go, bravo.
1919071	1919311	Nice.
1920472	1921953	So, there are three lights?
1923434	1923855	I guess, yeah.
1923935	1925296	I got the error one time.
1925456	1926516	I'm joking, Rob.
1928378	1928798	I hate you.
1929318	1929779	You know what?
1929819	1931260	Mailbag segment's canceled tonight.
1931340	1931660	Okay.
1931920	1932821	Jamie doesn't... You can read it.
1933161	1933882	No, I don't want to read it.
1933902	1935363	I had to read it last week because you weren't here.
1935923	1942388	When you send in your emails to mailbag at orangelonsradio.com, obviously we care very deeply about your emails that you send in to us.
1943115	1943776	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1960660	1967827	Dear Rob, Jamie, and Loki, last week you put out the call for developers who listen to this show to write in, and in that regard I qualify.
1967887	1979078	Three weeks ago I started working at Bottle Rocket Entertainment, the team responsible for the Mark of Kree and its sequel on PS2, as an environment artist.
1979158	1979739	Oh, that's cool.
1980319	1983402	For the people unsure what that entails, it's pretty much what it sounds like.
1983482	1986566	Environment artists build the art assets for the level in the game.
1986966	1994834	Since I just started recently, I have no grizzled words from the trenches of the horrors of game development, but I wanted to write in anyway as I've been listening to your show since last fall.
1995635	1997657	Actually, I wanted to thank you guys for the work that you do.
1997778	1999940	I listen to OLR and other podcasts at work.
2000373	2002414	and it makes my day that much more enjoyable.
2002614	2008839	In fact, aside from the caffeine, I basically had to subsist on podcasts to get me through the last bit of art school before I got this job.
2009219	2016063	I love OLR in particular because your enthusiasm for your program shows and as a result, every episode is guaranteed to entertain.
2016484	2018005	Thank you for all the work you put into this.
2018585	2024849	One last thing, my point of view of game development might be somewhat myopic at this point, but I know people have questions about
2025342	2027043	and I might be able to provide some answers.
2027143	2037592	I can't talk about anything related to the projects we're working on, but if any of your listeners want to know what it's like working in a game company or how best to break into the industry or anything like that, I might be able to help just putting that out there.
2038092	2041915	Sincerely, yours, Devin L. Well, maybe we'll have to have Devin on the show at some point.
2042095	2042896	Ask a developer.
2043076	2043917	That might be kind of fun.
2044237	2044678	That'd be cool.
2044938	2050182	But that's kind of neat to know that people on the inside are listening to the program and that always makes us feel pretty good, you know.
2051517	2055700	and certainly we were talking about the guy that worked for the Japanese developer.
2055740	2057681	He actually was sending me some pictures from Japan.
2057721	2058662	I actually have to show you.
2058982	2061624	He sent me some pictures from a pinball arcade in Japan, so I have to show it.
2061984	2062265	Nice.
2062385	2063245	So, kind of cool.
2063445	2065547	So thank you to the developers that listened to the show.
2065607	2067969	Just like any other listener, we really appreciate your support.
2068429	2069350	Well, we got one from the Rob D.
2071286	2078148	I was listening to last week's show on the way home from work yesterday, and yes, my quiz will label you as super spastic if you suck in that game.
2078709	2085811	I'm always amused when an issue with this word comes up because it shows a giant cultural divide between the USA and the UK that no one is really aware of.
2086191	2096154	For whatever reason, the word spaz is highly offensive in the UK, even to the point of the Spastic Society, a non-profit organization to aid those with cerebral palsy, changing its name to SCOPE.
2096812	2101914	In the US, the surfer lingo of the SoCal area made the word spaz a common insult among youth to this date.
2102495	2113500	A few years ago, Tiger Woods got in huge trouble with his UK fans when he said that he had played the best I've played for years, and as soon as I got on the green, I was a spaz during last year's Masters.
2113940	2115761	Of course, Americans had no idea what the problem was.
2115881	2120363	Merriam-Webster's doesn't even mention cerebral palsy and its definition of the word spaz.
2120423	2123524	A little side note, whenever I hear spastic, I think of spastic colon.
2124104	2125165	Anyway, back to the email.
2126431	2135439	Although not the most popular, by far the worst and funniest documented case of this happening is when an American wheelchair manufacturer decided to export one of their products to Great Britain for sale there.
2135739	2139162	Unfortunately, the name of this product was called, I kid you not, The Spaz with two Z's.
2139963	2141444	You can imagine how well that went over.
2141964	2145668	Apparently there's a link there, but our thing is not HTML, so poo.
2147529	2151833	On one hand, I feel sort of bad for the wheelchair company, but the name was cruel in the first place.
2153121	2161265	Isn't that kind of like selling a walker and calling it gimpy or marketing headgear for children with really bad teeth as the most unpopular kid in school brand?
2162145	2175932	Anyway, I guess the closest analogy I can make is if some Asian company wanted to make a humorous shirt that said, I'm chicken on the front and accidentally instead of using the word cock instead of chicken, not realizing how offensive it is.
2177336	2177896	Great show.
2178357	2180398	I keep up and keep up the good work.
2180878	2193086	Maybe you'll actually get to 500 episodes like I accidentally said you already had on your five-year show, Rob D. You know, I find the term scope offensive because it makes me think of mouthwash, which in turn makes me think of the dentist.
2193146	2199009	And I find dentists to be highly offensive because of what they charge me when I go in there to have my teeth cleaned.
2199449	2201130	So I find that term to be offensive.
2201611	2201771	So...
2202546	2204067	Obviously, I'm just messing around.
2204127	2208490	But, you know, we learned a lot about some of those cultural word differences last week.
2208530	2210911	You know, I had no idea that that was an offensive term over there.
2210971	2215234	But, you know, it's just part of the world we live in and all those funny little cultural differences.
2216354	2217095	More stuff.
2217155	2217755	More stuff.
2219036	2219977	Ossifer, once again.
2220317	2220677	Thank you.
2221818	2223859	And, yeah, Rob, you were drunk.
2223979	2225120	Quit denying your past.
2226280	2226641	Huh?
2226781	2227761	What did I do this time?
2228382	2229222	I'm just going to read on.
2229242	2230563	I swear, Ossifer, I wasn't drunk.
2231584	2233105	I think that's what it's referring to.
2233125	2237848	Anyway, thanks a lot for introducing me to this long anniversary from Powder Powder Paradise with a question mark.
2238228	2243752	I've been listening to it every day, multiple times a day, bolded, ever since, yeah, can you tell that I love it?
2243932	2244653	So yay for Rob.
2244693	2245213	Rob is cool.
2245233	2246294	Rob fan mail for the win.
2246334	2247615	Yay, I got fan mail.
2247635	2250737	But I can't leave Loki or Jamie out, so you all kick ass.
2250817	2251397	Smiley face.
2251617	2253258	Oh, boo, I want to be by myself and then love.
2253279	2253819	Bite my butt, Rob.
2254423	2256043	Your beloved listener, Osfer.
2256243	2256583	P.S.
2257244	2259484	Supernova location test back on.
2259984	2262785	Maybe during the time it was canceled, they made the game better.
2262905	2264525	Thoughts, EMUs, maybe?
2266405	2270626	Wasn't there some news on the whole Supernova test thing this week, like it's back on now?
2271166	2277807	In fact, I think it was posted to our own site, but that was the wonderful... The wonderful Dark Tetsuya actually stays on top of a lot of that stuff.
2278087	2280528	Yeah, the Supernova 2 test is back on again for July 12, 2007.
2282363	2284823	That's funny because that would be right around the same time as E3.
2285364	2288264	But yeah, that's what is floating around the internet apparently.
2293285	2294385	Can I read more email please?
2294445	2294785	Of course.
2295225	2296226	Thank you sir, may I have another?
2297666	2300086	Hi Orange Lounge Radio, this is a quick email from Mori.
2301827	2307908	Unfortunately for the past two weeks my computer has been relatively out of commission so I wasn't able to send along this message any sooner.
2308008	2309088	Excuses, excuses.
2309884	2314165	But congrats on five years and two weeks of being on the air.
2315186	2316646	Five years and two weeks as of today, yeah.
2317186	2327169	I've listened to your show for about a year and a half now, and since the last few episodes of the original OLR2GO edition of the podcast, you guys are the only show that I can actually sit down and listen to all the way without losing interest.
2327529	2328449	In short, you guys are great.
2328629	2328910	Thanks.
2329170	2330670	And we have a tilde at the end of the thanks.
2330950	2331230	Thank you.
2332411	2337252	But besides that, a few weeks ago I heard someone mention the Sega Pico at one point in the episodes.
2337622	2340583	I have fond memories of mine, which is currently sitting in a box in my closet.
2340603	2344765	I actually pulled it out and played around with it after hearing that basically it was Sega and edutainment.
2345325	2348726	I did, however, have something vaguely resembling a touchpad, which I forgot about.
2349107	2353488	Anywho, considering the apparently huge amount of systems DarkSakura owns, by any chance does she have one?
2354069	2358530	This has been something I've been wondering about for a while, since obviously I have nothing better to do.
2359651	2361071	Actually, I do not own a Pico.
2361472	2365133	I came very close to purchasing a Pico at Toys R Us, but we bought a Nomad instead.
2366328	2370012	I figured Nomad, Pico, you know, Nomad high on the pedestal.
2371093	2375217	However, I actually have been looking for a Pico since last week.
2375937	2378480	But Bill's and I'm going to Disneyland at the end of the month.
2378580	2379821	So Disneyland.
2379841	2380001	Addict.
2380402	2381883	Disneyland greater than Pico.
2382824	2384065	Teacups are better than Pico.
2384265	2386508	I know and I'm going to freaking ride the hell out.
2386568	2386948	I hate you.
2386968	2388730	Because the teacups go faster at night, Rob.
2389050	2390451	I hate you for going to Disneyland on the weekend.
2390471	2390952	I have to move.
2392046	2396630	which in turn will probably be no OLR that week but we're changing studios so what can you do?
2397351	2401054	And in closing, thanks again for your awesomeness and I hope to actually call in on the show one day.
2401414	2403816	Owen Sky's GameTap promotion made me subscribe to it.
2404257	2408200	Not quite as big of a purchase as a $60 game but still I thought it was worth mentioning.
2408540	2411343	Maury, possibly the second youngest listener at 14?
2412083	2418429	That doesn't help because people think I'm already up there in bed with them but I swear I'm not.
2418529	2419690	I think they're good.
2421238	2433512	Well, I have to say though, 14 and having, I have to say for a 14 year old, you have some of the best grammar in an email I have ever seen.
2434313	2435654	Nothing was misspelled.
2436675	2437997	You had one typo.
2439352	2447839	I have to say that you are a shining example of our public education system working, unless you go to private school.
2449000	2449700	So who's this again?
2450581	2450981	Maury.
2451001	2452903	Maury, our listener of the week, everybody.
2453023	2453383	Give it up.
2453744	2456486	You are the emailer of the millennium.
2457467	2458067	So there you go.
2460289	2463692	This one is by Schwal...
2465350	2466130	22, I guess.
2466811	2470231	Hey guys, been a while since I've written and I had to correct Loki's misuse of a word last week.
2471172	2473792	When referring to a mentally handicapped person, it's retard.
2474633	2476433	Example, that guy is a fucking retard.
2477633	2484135	When referring to music, that's R-I-T-A-R-D, short for retardando, which means to gradually become slower.
2486016	2489178	I actually was the one last week that said that retard is used in music.
2489259	2492481	But I knew it was the misspelling, but you still say it the same way.
2492601	2494723	Well, that's just two different spellings, same pronunciation.
2495143	2496144	Oh, well, keep up the good work.
2496264	2497785	I really have been enjoying this show.
2498686	2500747	Oh, oh, more people should play Overlord.
2500807	2501528	It's funny as hell.
2501928	2502969	Buy it so we get a sequel.
2503709	2503969	Okay.
2505110	2505771	Will do, chief.
2508113	2509454	Hey, Loki, retard your anger.
2509774	2512015	Next email, last email is from Nintendomaniac64.
2512116	2512336	Okay.
2513584	2517167	Hi, hola, bonjour, guten tag, konnichiwa, etc.
2517567	2520190	Although actually it's evening for us, so it would be konbanwa?
2520330	2520570	Anyway.
2521751	2523292	Oh my god, picky lady.
2524733	2525374	This is me, Rob.
2525694	2526495	I'm going to go get a water.
2526915	2527295	Oh, whatever.
2527996	2533040	This question is pretty much unrelated to OLR, but I may need the input by a largest group of people, a.k.a.
2533080	2539826	the chatroom, and not be completely ignored due to the uber speed that the comments travel at in the said chatroom.
2540976	2549781	Anyway, I'm finally going to be in an M3 Perfect, which is the slot 2 version to replace my broken supercard CF, which had a connector pin.
2550141	2553483	This has nothing to do with the... Well, you said it had nothing to do with the show.
2554243	2558045	Okay, chat room, I'm just going to read the question, okay?
2559273	2586911	um it said to replace my broken supercard CF which had a connector pin in the CF slot break off yes I tried to solder it back and it still doesn't work my question is if you or the chat room know if there are any mini or micro SD cards that are 4 gigabyte but not SDHC since the M3 the perfect isn't compatible with SDHC I'm still not sure if I'm going to get a 2 gig or 4 gig SD card but if there are any 4 gigabyte mini or micro non SDHC cards my problem is solved right there
2588784	2595306	and if anyone yells in the chat room and get an R4 or something, he needs 32 megabyte of extra RAM.
2595466	2596026	Okay, whatever.
2596066	2597167	This has nothing to do with the show.
2597947	2599508	I'm not going to read your answer.
2599968	2602388	Email people, okay?
2602829	2603889	Your question fails.
2606370	2608770	And we have an email from Sauce.
2609931	2611871	This says, Dear Rob, there are four lights.
2613672	2614232	Love, Tiara.
2614692	2616493	There are four lights, but only three show...
2616778	2620060	I can't wait to play Rob's voice the game to Iraqi Suicide Babies.
2623961	2627983	I'm sorry, I left the room when I heard Nintendo Maniac 64 send an email, but then I heard my name.
2628243	2629584	Just kidding, hearts.
2629684	2630044	What's that?
2630364	2631365	This email's from Sauce.
2631405	2635727	Dear Rob, there are four... Yes, but when the system breaks, there's only three that come on.
2637721	2638102	What's it say?
2638182	2638542	P.S.
2638582	2641465	I can't wait to play Rob's Voice the Game 2, Iraqi Suicide Baby.
2641485	2645048	Because four blinking lights means that your AV cable is unplugged.
2645068	2647811	Best email ever, except for the 14-year-old that can spell shit.
2649853	2650854	All right, close the mailbag.
2651655	2652495	We're way over time.
2652956	2654317	Mailbag is belated.
2654617	2657940	All right, if you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelongerator.com.
2658321	2660463	And maybe Jamie will make fun of you on air next.
2661414	2684710	or or compliment your grammar I would actually like to see we should have a grammar contest let's see if there's some 13 and 12 year olds that want to send in some emails and try to one-up Mori wouldn't that be exciting awesome uh so anyways I guess the ongoing quest to get Mother 3 translated is um going pretty well now two teams have kind of joined forces on the project and um
2685919	2686259	I don't know.
2686939	2691261	No word on yet when it's going to be done, but... Well, actually, no.
2692222	2693362	Yes, there was a small update.
2693922	2697224	They said that they're shooting for a release this year.
2698204	2701365	So... Awesome, I guess?
2702326	2702646	I don't know.
2703066	2706647	Not much a fan of Mother 3, but... Great.
2707288	2708648	I fucking love EarthBound.
2708688	2711549	Why doesn't Nintendo, I don't know, translate the game themselves?
2712009	2712610	Sell it here?
2712990	2713930	Because they're dumbasses.
2713950	2715591	Because they would rather, you know...
2716656	2719399	Redo Picross and release it on the DS.
2720200	2721822	There's so much Nintendo hate tonight.
2721862	2723884	I apologize to the Nintendo fans, but I don't.
2724184	2724585	It's alright.
2724665	2725966	Next week will be a Nintendo love.
2726146	2726607	That's true.
2727387	2732613	I know there's a lot of love for this this week.
2732913	2738179	Rock Band had some footage hit the internet and a lot of folks were very, very happy about this.
2738476	2741538	I'm going to play this in studio here because I'm sure not everybody has seen it.
2741638	2742438	Oh, never mind, I can't.
2742458	2743959	It got taken off YouTube.
2745820	2750963	But basically, okay, imagine Guitar Hero side by side three times and Karaoke Revolution on top.
2751304	2752704	That's kind of what Rock Band looked like.
2752925	2762010	And the video, I guess, was leaked to the Internet, so then Harmonix kind of had to step in and put something a little more legit out there and kind of confess to what was going on.
2762569	2769750	and mentioned that the song that you heard in there, Welcome to the Jungle, was just a demo song and may not actually be in the final version of the game.
2770130	2771131	That was so awesome.
2771231	2772431	It looked like a shitload of fun.
2772451	2773391	Did you guys see the clip?
2773551	2774531	Oh my god, yes.
2774931	2775671	Yeah, it looks good.
2775971	2781432	The only negative complaint I've heard on it is that maybe the karaoke part is too small, which could be very hard to see on a regular TV.
2781492	2783693	I don't know about that, but it looked pretty good.
2785153	2788294	But doesn't everybody have a widescreen HDTV these days, huh?
2788314	2790174	Well, it's not so much that, but shouldn't everyone...
2791545	2794026	Shouldn't everyone know the lyrics to Welcome to the Jungle?
2794086	2796268	I mean, shouldn't you know this song by heart?
2796288	2800890	I don't know the lyrics.
2803052	2804132	See, I could just make it up.
2804412	2808174	I don't need the... There's other words in there too, but who cares?
2808655	2811176	Will this game let you cheat like Karaoke Revolution does?
2811216	2818060	No, they supposedly have a thing that detects the phonics in your voice so that you're not going to be able to go... You know, like, what was it, um...
2820117	2824240	It's the end of the world as we know it, where it's like, uh, you know, the whole song.
2824400	2826742	That's how I sing it's the end of the world as we know it in Karaoke Revolution.
2826782	2829504	Have you ever played any of the Japanese versions of Karaoke Revolution?
2829824	2830264	I have not.
2830724	2833466	They actually make sure that you are pronouncing everything right.
2833907	2834147	Wow.
2835027	2836308	They're very, very specific.
2839150	2839611	Let's see.
2839891	2843013	TheRobD says that was the greatest rendition of Welcome to the Jungle ever.
2843253	2845835	See why they want Sky's voice in the game?
2847116	2848617	Ego plus five right there.
2851343	2853965	Plus four strength, plus four stam, plus four ego.
2855506	2859948	Actdeft says, is telling the Rob D, Harmonix says it won't be that expensive.
2860008	2863271	Oh, because the Rob D said, Rock Band Eagles, expensive game I won't be buying.
2864832	2865392	So, I don't know.
2866072	2866933	It could be fun, though.
2867653	2870315	Jamie will buy it, because she loves those types of games.
2870395	2878100	Unfortunately, I will probably get suckered into buying it, like I did with Guitar Hero 2, and then I won't play it again.
2881313	2884235	I will not do the karaoke portion of the game, though.
2885016	2885797	I think I might.
2886517	2889840	Please, one time on the show, do the karaoke.
2889920	2890481	Never!
2890921	2892903	Please, can't you do Welcome to the Jungle?
2893924	2897847	No, but you just did such a wonderful rendition there.
2899488	2902211	Even though I hate Loki right now, I still love Jamie for now.
2902998	2907199	So I will allow her a chance to share with you all her website of the week.
2907219	2908340	Because she was out last week.
2908400	2910561	So she's got to make it extra good this week.
2910901	2911341	DarkSakura.
2911381	2912861	I was dead sore last week.
2912961	2918123	Where should the kids be pointing their websites, browsers this week?
2918363	2921724	The website of the week is newsaskew.com.
2923745	2926406	Because it's Kevin Smith.
2926526	2928666	And I don't need to tell you anything else.
2929267	2930207	It's freaking Kevin Smith.
2931616	2933497	News for View Askew MoviePoopShoot.com
2960948	2964630	I seem to remember that Kevin Smith will actually post on his forums and stuff.
2965811	2967672	He's actually got a blog up too.
2967832	2968172	Oh, cool.
2968192	2969293	Called My Boring Ass Life.
2973075	2975377	The internet did forgive him for Jersey Girl though, right?
2976197	2976998	I think so.
2977418	2978599	I think it's fair to say the internet.
2978619	2979960	I never did see Clerks 2 though.
2979980	2981000	I should hang my head in shame.
2981040	2981741	I need to go rent it.
2982501	2983442	I do need to see it.
2983462	2984262	How did I miss it?
2984622	2986183	I don't still watch any movies anymore.
2986223	2986684	It's sad.
2987884	2989285	And Kevin Smith has a MySpace too.
2989685	2989946	Does he?
2989966	2990566	I should add him.
2991167	2992809	I love The Evening with Kevin Smith.
2992829	2994510	That's like one of my favorite DVDs ever.
2995391	2996872	All right, newsaskew.com.
2996892	2999334	Check it out when you're taking a break from games.
2999615	3001656	Does Kevin Smith admit that he plays video games?
3002117	3002918	I would imagine he does.
3002978	3003738	He seems like a big nerd.
3003758	3004239	I don't think so.
3005520	3007542	Well, how come there hasn't been a Jay and Silent Bob video game?
3007562	3008182	That's what I want to know.
3009303	3009764	Maybe someday.
3010064	3010685	Good question.
3012806	3013327	Anywho...
3015492	3017694	There's some interesting news coming from Australia.
3018434	3029763	Apparently, a sort of affair between a 31-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy went awry, and she was arrested for kidnapping charges.
3030284	3044214	The whole thing took place over World of Warcraft, where apparently the 31-year-old... I'm just going to assume that she was a MILF, because, you know, she's... Well, no, of course not.
3044595	3044795	Anyways...
3045665	3047587	Then again, if she's hitting on 17-year-old boys, who knows?
3047607	3047807	I know.
3047867	3048247	MILF?
3048307	3051749	Does that mean, like, mom is large and fat?
3052530	3053190	Is that MILF?
3056433	3057413	Anyways.
3057533	3061536	So, apparently she was, you know,
3062932	3068876	Creating this deep and trusting relationship with her barely legal boyfriend for more than a year.
3069137	3072439	How do you form a deep and trusting relationship on World of Warcraft?
3072859	3073380	I don't know.
3073920	3080385	I will give you this four-strength, four-stam leather belt if you will eat my pussy.
3080765	3081286	I don't know.
3081326	3082286	How do you do that?
3086269	3087890	Or I'll give you a Leroy Jenkins.
3089772	3091233	Is that a new sexual term?
3093317	3095659	Is that what these two say during... Oh, I shouldn't even say that.
3095699	3096660	I shouldn't use that as bad.
3096800	3097160	Never mind.
3097180	3108770	But anyways, apparently she was going to... Was it... She was going to meet the boy and they were going... Because she lived in Australia, but she was going to meet him.
3108870	3116176	I guess he lived out of country and basically take him with her and they were going to fly to Australia and he was going to live with her.
3117336	3120539	And apparently the parents found out about it and had her arrested.
3121360	3122541	Wait, so she was Australian?
3122741	3122941	Yeah.
3123371	3123791	Oh, wow.
3124732	3125132	Wow.
3126313	3129896	What's wrong with you guys in Australia and your MILFs?
3130296	3130976	No, I'm just kidding.
3131897	3133618	Obviously, it's one bad apple ruining the barrel.
3135079	3143225	I'm sure the media hasn't gone crazy with this story about how World of Warcraft is predator for children and blah, blah, blah.
3143285	3148208	Dateline NBC special about the scary MILFs on Warcraft reaching out.
3149235	3151036	Buying plane tickets for 17-year-old boys.
3151336	3153458	The boy lived in North Carolina.
3155299	3160202	So I would assume that the age of consent, of course, here is usually over 18.
3160943	3162023	That's a long plane ride.
3162043	3164285	He'll probably be 18 by the time he gets to Australia.
3164385	3165906	So what's so wrong with that?
3166046	3169028	You know, with the time zone changes and the date line, you know.
3169648	3169788	He's 18.
3169848	3170068	Exactly.
3171866	3175367	Alright, well we are just about done with all the stories for tonight.
3175427	3179589	And we are going to be opening up the Skype line for you guys to call in and interact with our program.
3179609	3182150	If you want to give us a call, you can call us on Skype.
3182190	3183710	Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
3183850	3186871	Or you can call us on our 800 number, or I should say 877 number.
3186891	3187472	That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3187772	3188332	That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3188492	3189953	Excuse me, we will take...
3198226	3199527	Your calls very soon.
3199567	3201869	However, first, we have another score to settle.
3203210	3204611	And that's tonight's list list.
3206473	3208354	We need to know who won tonight's list list.
3208374	3212638	The topic tonight, of course, most random things we'd like to see at this year's E3.
3212658	3213518	We have winners.
3214379	3215600	And let's reveal them now.
3215760	3219904	Number three, the number three thing our chat room would like to most see happen to E3 this year.
3220764	3223807	Halo 3 gets delayed or canceled.
3224893	3226194	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3252768	3254629	Pyramid Head must show up and kill everyone.
3254689	3255129	Yes!
3257850	3258350	There you have it.
3259090	3262611	Tonight's definitive list of the needs of E3 2007.
3263471	3267033	Alright, let's open up the Skype line and take some calls.
3267053	3270814	1-877-GAME-OLR Did they do a good job tonight, you think?
3272474	3273415	I think they did a good one.
3273455	3273775	I don't know.
3274195	3275435	I think they came up with a good list.
3275635	3276435	I don't know what you guys think.
3277336	3278716	Alright, let's go to the phones.
3279837	3280837	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3280857	3281197	Who's this?
3281997	3282898	Raven's Dolphin!
3283258	3284519	Oh, surprise, surprise.
3284559	3286060	How did you get through Raven's Dolphin?
3286700	3287941	My new Mac, that's why.
3288121	3289522	Do you have us on speed dial?
3290583	3290843	Yes.
3291183	3292083	Alright, well, it worked.
3292584	3293604	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
3294545	3301349	Well, the E3's coming up, and I know everyone's really excited, and the thing about it is, it's very small.
3301870	3305432	Does it feel weird to you that it's now instead of it was in May?
3305792	3309675	To me, it was around my birthday, and I was like, yeah, E3's coming up!
3309695	3310996	And I'm like, now it's like, E3's up?
3312870	3319495	Well, yeah, but at the same time as we were kind of saying in part A, just because it's a smaller show doesn't mean the companies have any less or more to gain.
3319555	3325619	And there's going to be press there that's just as, you know, as honest as there were in years past.
3325659	3329542	I think enough people have managed to get in, even though it's supposed to have been a lockdown show or whatever.
3329962	3342631	So I don't really see what's exactly changed except for the fact that, you know, little podcasters like us and little press and foreign press and GameStop employees don't get in and Best Buy employees and all that crap.
3343829	3345052	Yeah, I guess you're right.
3345192	3348578	You know, we're still going to get the press conferences like we normally do.
3349200	3351524	So, I don't see much of a change like you said.
3351584	3352847	You know, we're still going to see it.
3354898	3355678	Yeah, I don't know.
3355718	3358859	I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens as E3 goes on.
3358919	3359559	It's going to be hard to say.
3360559	3372501	And you could say that there's not as many people to tear apart the demos or base their opinion of games right off the demos, but you're seeing the whole Xbox Live and PlayStation 3 become more and more and more.
3373041	3373581	You know what I mean?
3374181	3380162	You can download those on their own live or PlayStation Network services, so you can get a lot of those demos, actually.
3381243	3383603	I'm really excited for actually bringing it home.
3384273	3388377	And that's going to be really interesting because they did an okay job with it last year.
3388437	3392580	But for the people like me saying, oh, my, ooh, Lost Planet's on Xbox Live.
3393421	3401788	I was at E3 last year, and I still enjoyed the Xbox Live, you know, watching their videos from the show floor because I kind of actually liked seeing some of the booths I went to at E3.
3401808	3402688	It was kind of fun.
3402768	3403249	So I don't know.
3403269	3404710	Maybe I'm just weird like that.
3405714	3408336	Yeah, I'll be home too, but Scott got that thing on his head.
3408496	3410137	Yeah, I heard about that over at Allgame.
3410177	3411378	What the hell is that?
3411438	3413480	He bought a webcam for his head?
3413960	3414460	He's going to E3?
3415021	3418884	See, with stuff like that, you're not going to keep people out of E3.
3420665	3423087	Where there is information, there will be people seeking it out.
3423667	3424688	One more thing, RavenSolven?
3425348	3426909	Yeah, one more thing.
3426989	3431333	I just bought this Mac, and no, I'm not using games because there's no such thing as games on the Mac!
3432874	3434675	So what did you buy the Mac for, angry one?
3435751	3437072	I bought it because of change.
3437132	3438433	And no, Loki, don't kill me.
3438693	3440434	Don't pick up that pitchfork.
3440574	3441234	He'll be okay.
3442175	3443616	No, no, no, I'm not switching.
3443996	3444196	No.
3445297	3447418	All right, well, thanks for the call, Raven Stolven.
3447438	3447998	Take care, buddy.
3448519	3449039	You too, bye.
3449099	3449659	All right, bye-bye.
3451220	3451500	All right.
3452521	3456483	By the way, Maury, our emailer of the week, sent me a private message in chat.
3456903	3459485	Maury says, just for clarification, I am in public school.
3460582	3464704	Ah, well then, wherever you are, congrats to your public school system.
3464744	3467965	Give your English teachers mad props for me.
3468986	3470526	And mad props to you for paying attention.
3471026	3473968	I want to show you this on air real quick because there's not a lot of calls coming in right now.
3474028	3474928	So we want more calls.
3475188	3475628	But look at this.
3475668	3477149	Somebody just sent me the link for this in chat.
3477189	3479030	This is actually what they're doing at E3.
3479430	3482711	And you can see that Scott is on... I can see your arm.
3482831	3483211	I'm sorry.
3483351	3487093	You can see Scott is on live right now playing Texas Hold'em.
3487313	3489414	Although I think he must have it hooked into his TV or something.
3490831	3495512	Oh, he's filing a complaint against somebody right now on Xbox Live.
3495792	3496492	Isn't that weird?
3497772	3498332	That's pretty cool.
3499272	3501153	It's like reality TV gone crazy.
3502153	3504093	SSJ100 Matt says, Link, rush out the fuck up.
3505053	3509294	My god, I'd love to do this with my cat while I'm, you know, wait for the day.
3509354	3512655	Normally at work, you know, the cat stays in the bedroom.
3512675	3516495	I should put a camera up on the wall or something.
3516515	3520156	I tried to say hi from OLR in the chat room, but it wouldn't let me because I didn't have a nickname, so...
3520953	3522074	Legend of Zaku How was anime next?
3522514	3525896	It was alright though, I mean, I know I was rooming with Ranma, so it was even better
3548724	3555867	Um, yeah, I, yeah, since I think he's not here right now, he's supposed to be calling you to give you the scoop on everything.
3555927	3557047	Actually, wait, hold on, hold on.
3557927	3558228	Hello?
3559668	3560748	Hey, what's up?
3560868	3563649	Oh, I put Zaku on hold because I saw you calling in on the back line.
3563669	3564350	Can I conference?
3564390	3565130	How do I conference?
3567511	3568151	Hold on, let me see.
3568651	3569612	This might put you on hold.
3570852	3571092	Cool.
3572433	3573113	Zaku, are you still there?
3573985	3574205	Yeah.
3574365	3575946	Okay, Ranma's actually on the other line.
3575987	3577267	We just had to put him on hold.
3577888	3578388	God damn it.
3578428	3579169	How do we conference?
3579189	3580049	Can't you conference in the studio?
3580069	3581350	Oh, wait, there's a button that says conference.
3582051	3584232	Join current call to another call.
3587295	3588816	This is live radio, boys and girls.
3590777	3591037	Okay.
3592218	3592558	Hello?
3593339	3593519	Yeah.
3594139	3595000	No, I'm conferencing with you.
3595220	3595600	Hold on.
3595640	3596701	We're going to call you right back.
3597582	3597902	All right.
3597982	3598883	Live radio, boys and girls.
3601104	3601925	Hi, you still there, Ranma?
3603766	3604006	Hello?
3605607	3606508	I fucked it all up.
3606588	3606968	Ranma!
3607909	3608249	Ranma!
3611932	3613954	Now I just lost our entire Anime Next report.
3619918	3621099	Let's just call Zaku back.
3623941	3624181	Hi.
3624842	3626083	It didn't work, so whatever.
3626123	3628184	Just give us your report and then we'll hope Ranma calls back.
3628425	3628905	What's on your mind?
3629690	3635792	Yeah, basically, between the agreement between me and him, I'm covering the gaming aspect of it.
3636232	3650737	So far, their gaming room, I mean, it has the usual stuff, Halo, Dirt Strike, they added stuff like, you know, Guitar Hero, and the inevitable 2DX setup, which was mediocre at best.
3651297	3655058	Yeah, but that's about it, they had tournaments on certain games, like Smash Bros.,
3657316	3658897	Was there any new stuff in the game room?
3658937	3659837	Stuff you hadn't seen before?
3661018	3665520	Only the guitar gear from what I heard since they replaced the DDR setup with that.
3666060	3667681	They used the 360 version.
3668681	3669202	Oh, interesting.
3669502	3669762	Okay.
3670002	3673824	And so they held tournaments on that and Gears of War.
3675675	3682017	But besides that, they were also selling a lot of imports in the dealer's room within the convention hall.
3682357	3684718	So I managed to snag a copy of Fifth Style for like $40.
3685518	3685898	Very cool.
3685918	3689619	What about any gaming paraphernalia, for lack of a better word?
3690080	3692800	Like this Ball Fair figure came from something like that.
3693321	3694841	Yeah, they were all in the dealer room.
3695081	3699422	There was a lot of cosplayers dressing up as Mario and other video game characters.
3700063	3704104	But yeah, most of the good merchandise... I bet you didn't see someone dressed up as a Wii Remote.
3705052	3706813	Oh, actually, close.
3707354	3710977	An actual Wii, with the other person holding the Wii mode behind them.
3711117	3712558	Jonas, I think someone stole your idea.
3714179	3717382	Wait, they cosplay as an actual Wii system without the Wii mode?
3717402	3717622	Yes.
3717642	3722666	No, an actual Wii system, and then this other person was holding the Wii mode for them.
3723086	3725788	I heard rumors that that showed up in Sack Enemy in January.
3727990	3730932	If that is the case, I might see him on Sack Enemy in July.
3731947	3734928	You're talking about an East Coast thing, I don't know.
3734948	3738610	Who the hell would come to SAC for an anime convention if you don't live here?
3739130	3740111	Or the Bay Area, maybe.
3740651	3743352	You're talking about something that happened in Jersey, not Sacramento.
3743452	3744432	Alright, look.
3745613	3747354	Now stop the whole bi-coastal thing.
3747374	3749054	Zaku, anything else you want to share on the game room?
3751055	3752576	That's pretty much about it, I mean...
3753802	3761724	You know, it was really... The only thing I can say that really pissed me off was just the fact that it was too small and they were just controlling crowds.
3762245	3767826	Basically, it was basically almost like a nightclub where they just had people just waiting there in line.
3768766	3771887	You know, since the game room was packed most of the time anyways.
3773408	3773908	So, yeah.
3775048	3781550	Alright, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can go to Ranma and get his side of the story on what's going on.
3782034	3783554	Anything else you want to say about the con real quick?
3784555	3785095	It was alright.
3785155	3788856	I mean, it's my first con, so I really don't have that much to say.
3790176	3792917	All I need to know is that I need to go to more conventions.
3793077	3794498	But you want to go to more cons now?
3795298	3797078	Yeah, I guess I got a plan for next year.
3797118	3797939	Oh, it's a con!
3798439	3799419	Well, I guess that's a good sign.
3800599	3803320	Alright, who knows?
3803820	3806681	I'm hoping next year I'll be able to afford an East Coast con, so we'll see.
3806701	3807681	Alright.
3808061	3808822	Alright, later, Zaku.
3809542	3810102	Alright, later.
3810592	3814255	And of course, now that I'm finished with Zaku, Ranma is nowhere to be seen.
3815215	3816296	I should be able to call him back, though.
3816316	3817397	He's somewhere in the history, right?
3819739	3820039	Damn it.
3820959	3822020	Live radio, boys and girls.
3822981	3823541	I guess not.
3824222	3825343	We'll take another call real quick.
3826403	3827284	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3827304	3827624	Who's this?
3828785	3829125	Hey, guys.
3829145	3830486	This is Footy Monster from Argentina.
3830506	3831587	Hey, Footy Monster.
3831627	3832308	What's on your mind?
3832428	3834549	We're waiting for Ranma to call back, but he never did.
3834589	3835810	So we're taking another call in the meantime.
3835830	3836371	So what's on your mind?
3837131	3839173	All right, then I'll make it fast just in case he calls back.
3839253	3839693	It's all good.
3840134	3841375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3859960	3860681	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3881285	3895255	or you might have like a ball that starts going faster and faster which is second or you might need to blow into the screen to have the ball go up a little bit all the time instead of keep going down because sometimes you're like on a scrolling screen and you're always going up and if you get stuck you die and stuff like that.
3895295	3896956	It's really weird but it's actually pretty fun.
3897076	3897817	How do you control that?
3897857	3898497	With the stylus?
3899398	3900058	All with the stylus.
3900078	3901339	There's no buttons whatsoever.
3902400	3904041	Do you drag the paddle around or...?
3904753	3905973	Yeah, you drag the paddle around.
3906093	3908174	Sometimes you've got to drag just left and right.
3908294	3911175	Sometimes you can drag across the whole screen so you can actually move it up and down too.
3911915	3914356	And there's this level where you actually have to draw your own paddle.
3915416	3915556	Wow.
3915596	3917116	So you can draw it in any shape you want.
3917397	3917597	Huh.
3918337	3919237	That sounds pretty cool.
3919937	3920177	I know.
3920397	3924599	It's like a team of ten people that made it, and it's like 20 bucks or something like that.
3924619	3929700	So, I mean, I'm definitely going to try to pick it up next week when I go to Toronto.
3929740	3929820	So
3930676	3931918	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3946616	3950298	Actually, there's a little part where you're basically controlling a ship.
3950338	3953000	Instead of having just a paddle, it's a ship that shoots lasers.
3953480	3959463	So you can actually shoot lasers and destroy obstacles on the screen and stuff like that while you're bouncing the ball around.
3959803	3961124	Do you get to fight Doh?
3963185	3963626	What was that, sorry?
3963646	3964726	Do you get to fight Doh?
3965947	3966167	Yeah.
3967628	3967868	All right.
3968568	3971450	Real quickly, before we let you go, anything you're looking forward to at E3 this week?
3973068	3983712	Yeah, actually, I'm looking for everything RPG related for obvious reasons, and I'm really curious to see if Sega is going to announce anything related to Shenmue, like at all, even Shenmue Online, anything.
3983772	3992395	But it's just the hopeful in me that I know it will not happen, but I have to keep wondering about it, you know, because they robbed me from my Shenmue 3, so hey, you know.
3992655	3997977	I would say you have about as much chance of seeing Shenmue 3 as you do the public apology for Sonic.
3998177	4000378	Yeah, Shenmue 2 sort of bombed, didn't it?
4001263	4005790	The first one was really good, especially playing Space Harrier.
4006751	4013001	We probably shouldn't be getting to this because I'm such a big fanboy that I could talk for hours about the game.
4013562	4014083	Just saying that.
4015031	4015971	And one last thing.
4015991	4019032	I think next weekend there's going to be a fighting game tournament in Toronto.
4019332	4019932	Oh, fun.
4020372	4021352	In York University.
4022693	4025673	So, you know, if you are interested, it's like five bucks or ten bucks to get in.
4025693	4026473	It's like three days.
4027114	4029494	And it's going to be, you know, crazy full of people.
4029514	4032815	So I'm going to try to, since my flight arrives on Saturday, I'm going to try to go straight there.
4033295	4034795	Well, give us a call and let us know how it goes.
4035675	4037536	Shout OLR really loud.
4038376	4040936	I'll call in, you know, next Sunday.
4041156	4041477	All right.
4041517	4041937	Sounds good.
4041957	4043197	Thanks so much for the call, FootyMonster.
4043237	4043537	Take care.
4044557	4045197	Okay, you guys too.
4045417	4046018	Alright, bye-bye.
4046758	4046938	Bye.
4074611	4078215	I wanted to hear the report too from an anime vet.
4078595	4084160	SSJ100, Matt, you're suddenly my hero for saying Admiral Ackbar's cereal is greater than Night Trap 2.
4086663	4091648	We watched that right before you showed up at the 4th of July party.
4091788	4094070	We watched the Star Wars Robot Chicken show.
4095080	4095941	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4119144	4126266	Boyfriend's really good friend is a physician's assistant, so we always call him for drug advice, like, what should I be taking, because I have a killer headache.
4126306	4126746	And it worked.
4127326	4129627	All right, I don't see Ranma calling back, so at least we'll go to another call.
4130047	4130987	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4131007	4131347	Who's this?
4132847	4133468	Hey, Rob.
4134548	4135688	Able to Think from the forums.
4135728	4136948	Here, let me mute my thing.
4137349	4138689	Hello, Able to Think.
4141450	4142450	Are you a first-time caller?
4143670	4144250	Yeah, I am.
4144470	4145631	Well, welcome to the show.
4145691	4146331	What's on your mind?
4146371	4146931	Thanks for calling.
4148413	4162665	That psycho lady from Australia who decided to try to abduct... Well, technically abduct the kid from whatever state that was.
4162705	4164186	That was kind of gross.
4164746	4166007	Yeah, what is up with that?
4166148	4168149	What do you want to say about that?
4168289	4172593	I mean, does that just not make you feel good in your tummy?
4172713	4173534	Does it make you sick?
4174975	4176256	It makes me want to go...
4176929	4182995	Grab a shotgun and hopefully... Well now wait a minute, careful what you say on an internet radio program.
4183015	4184497	You need to be shot with happy lasers.
4184757	4188481	Yes, that's right, you want to shoot with flowers and rose petals.
4188521	4189722	Bunch of flowers!
4191023	4193966	Seriously, if a lady like that came to my door, I'd probably freak.
4195191	4204036	Well, but the thing that pisses me off about it is that it gives World of Warcraft a bad name because nobody stops to think that, oh, this is just some crazy bitch.
4204396	4210099	But they go, oh, well, they met on World of Warcraft, so obviously all the crazies are on World of Warcraft.
4211480	4212220	Which is somewhat true.
4212260	4215562	There are a lot of crazies on World of Warcraft, but we're not all crazy.
4216862	4217363	What's that, buddy?
4218743	4223666	I think you mean video games in general because that seems to be whatever everybody thinks.
4224215	4227676	Whenever anything goes wrong with society, it's all video games' fault.
4228477	4228997	That's true.
4229357	4229917	That happens.
4231878	4235359	And our crazy psycho lawyer friend's name we must not mention.
4235379	4236259	That's absolutely right.
4236419	4236740	I know.
4236820	4239220	It drives us nuts.
4239260	4241181	Well, what are you looking forward to at E3 next week?
4242842	4243802	Okay.
4244182	4249684	I want to see if Nintendo announces a Wii Hard Drive.
4250945	4251885	A Wii Hard Drive?
4253208	4254448	What the hell would they use it for?
4256389	4257429	Virtual console games.
4257509	4271814	And if they have an Xbox Live service coming on, then they're going to need to get it so you can have more space or else you're not going to be able to fit all your games on there.
4272394	4277896	Or how about they use the SD memory card slot that they have on there and don't seem to use for anything.
4279357	4279837	Yeah, well...
4284988	4291732	I'm sure they'll use it for all that download content that's available on WeConnect24.
4292633	4301959	I know my flash drive is teeming with tons and tons and tons and tons of content, so much so that I don't get around to playing any of it.
4302489	4303330	Well, I mean, who knows?
4303390	4310514	You know, the Magic 8-Ball says not bloody likely on that, but who knew that Nintendo would put out a two-screen system with a touchscreen?
4310534	4312595	I mean, you know, crazier things have happened.
4314577	4314817	Yep.
4315817	4317418	Oh, I'm done, too.
4319340	4320080	I have an FU.
4320120	4321921	Is that okay if I FU something?
4321941	4322722	Really quick, sure.
4324343	4326384	FU to spin markers because they cheat.
4326404	4327905	They spin markers.
4327945	4329206	I can't spin my fingers.
4329750	4330831	So you're giving F.U.
4330851	4331611	an 0 and on 2.
4332892	4334273	What's the problem with the spin markers?
4335854	4339116	Okay, see, it's like a nice lady.
4339136	4341598	You have to get their sweet spot or else it doesn't work.
4344120	4345521	Very well put, my friend.
4346081	4346681	Very well put.
4346701	4348182	All right, we've got to let you go, though, buddy.
4348202	4353186	Thanks so much for the call, but we're going to try and get Ranma one more time here, and we'll talk to you again, okay?
4354286	4354507	See you.
4354667	4355507	All right, thanks for the call.
4356888	4357829	We like hearing from noobs.
4358697	4359817	It's always good to hear from new people.
4360238	4360898	Ah, damn it.
4360958	4363239	Just as I went to the tab that Arama's call, he dropped.
4364119	4364259	Ah.
4365200	4365740	Oh, there he is again.
4365780	4366320	Let's try it again.
4367520	4368041	One more time.
4368061	4368821	You're on Orange Sounds Radio.
4368841	4369241	Who's this?
4370422	4371302	This is Ranma.
4371342	4372062	Can you hear me now?
4372082	4372562	Thank God.
4372622	4373523	Yes, we can.
4373603	4374203	We can hear you.
4374243	4375203	What's on your mind, buddy?
4375784	4376884	This better be good.
4378005	4378245	All right.
4378285	4381746	And I'll call it with my anime next con report.
4381866	4383006	And I'll tell you this right now.
4383287	4386828	For a local con, it was pretty much off the walls.
4387725	4389086	Really, that's a glowing reveal.
4389106	4389566	What happened?
4389586	4391026	What made this con so freaking great?
4392567	4396888	Well, one of the main important things about cons is it's just as good as the friends who were there.
4397188	4403111	I guess with me, when I got there, I knew like half the people there, you know, getting stopped, like, hey, how are you and stuff.
4403171	4412534	And the fact that it's like, the way that the con is laid out, you have the Expo Center, like six, seven hotels in the area, everybody's hanging out at the Hollywood front lawns.
4413010	4414611	or to hang out from the Expo Center.
4414812	4419876	Then you go on the inside, you see like a lot of video game cosplay, which was really awesome in my book.
4420677	4422778	So was there a lot of gaming content at this con?
4422798	4426581	Because the way Sakura made it sound, it wasn't too much on the gaming.
4427883	4429124	Well, I do know this much.
4429284	4433307	They basically got rid of the DDR room and replaced it with Guitar Hero.
4434208	4439072	Yeah, I guess you kind of seen that slowly happening at a lot of cons and pretty soon Rock Band, huh?
4440558	4442400	No, it's called Sprint Network
4460580	4462281	Chris Patton, Monica Rial, ADV, Funimation
4489935	4514439	and the big thing that's always is Final Fantasy which is a gig but that's starting to kind of dwindle down now you see a lot of more stuff that's coming I saw a lot of Lucky Star cosplay I still see some SMA which is still somewhat popular interesting huh very cool alright well anything else any funny funny things happen at the con you want to share with us especially funny moments
4516249	4524154	Well, I was at the bed dog, which is the staff party, and the Las Vegas rule was put in effect.
4524895	4527496	So I really can't tell you about that, but I can say this.
4527796	4533700	Most of my funny experiences is that running into people that I know, and I'm like, do I know you?
4534280	4535661	Oh, now I know who you are.
4536002	4539224	Different costume, different makeup, and it's like, ah, I see.
4540364	4542966	What happens at anime cons stays at anime cons, huh?
4544159	4547561	Definitely, especially when you're taking shots of Silco.
4548001	4550762	Well, alright, don't have too much fun over there, okay?
4551943	4552683	I don't want any luck.
4552743	4554644	I was on my way back when I was trying to call.
4555884	4556104	What?
4556205	4556545	I'm sorry?
4557745	4560687	I was on my way back from the party when I was trying to call.
4561227	4563528	Ah, well, maybe that explains some of the difficulty we had earlier.
4563548	4567790	Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling and giving us your report, okay?
4568830	4569230	No problem.
4569270	4569931	Take care.
4570131	4570571	Alright, later.
4571789	4579831	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4581731	4582032	Hello?
4582592	4583272	Hi, who's this?
4583492	4584232	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4585052	4587093	This is Sinan from Finland.
4587773	4590334	Oh, wow, we love getting listeners from far away.
4590394	4592634	What's on your mind, my Finnish friend?
4594275	4599896	I don't really have all that much in mind, I think, because it's early in the morning over here.
4600379	4602800	I know you've been staying up very late to listen to us live.
4602820	4603840	Well, we appreciate it.
4604681	4609643	Well, I was off to work at the beginning, but I've been here one hour now, I think.
4610343	4611104	Oh, very cool.
4611524	4614525	Well, has there been a topic tonight that you wanted to chime in on?
4614545	4615345	No.
4616866	4617306	Not really.
4617746	4623629	While at work, I listen to the five... What the fuck is this sound I'm hearing?
4623809	4626950	It's Rob being silly.
4627010	4628371	I think you're hearing us echoing.
4628431	4628771	It's okay.
4629584	4634969	I don't think we've had someone call in just to say, hey, who's up?
4635970	4643237	It's really because I listened to the five-year anniversary show, and I thought I would just drop in a line.
4643297	4649062	After all, I got back from work, and I thought that maybe I could call in now and never again listen live.
4650263	4652405	Well, did you enjoy the five-year anniversary show?
4654063	4654484	E3 Big News
4674742	4678603	Yeah, of course, it's always better, except for now, isn't it smaller nowadays?
4678863	4681524	Well, a little bit, but it's still all the same news.
4681624	4685706	The show itself might be small, but the news, I believe, is still going to stay the same.
4686106	4689087	Is there anything that you hope will happen at this year's E3?
4690427	4695949	I hope there will be some good information about Fallout 3, because that's a game I'm very interested in.
4695969	4697890	Ah, Fallout 3, what is it about Fallout 3?
4697950	4702771	Were you a fan of the first two games, or have you just seen the screenshots, you're excited?
4703092	4704272	What is it about Fallout that you love?
4705461	4709024	I'm a huge Fallout fan, which means that Fallout 3 I'm pretty scared about.
4709084	4711146	I think it's going to be shit.
4711466	4714648	Why do you think that Fallout 3 is going to be shit?
4715509	4716970	It's going to be Oblivion with guns.
4718892	4719512	Oblivion with guns.
4719713	4721494	But Oblivion's a freaking great game.
4721734	4726178	But I guess, you know, maybe that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to translate well into a series like Fallout.
4727058	4727859	No, I don't think so.
4728359	4730181	And I don't really like Oblivion either.
4730641	4731722	You don't like Oblivion?
4733063	4733704	No, of course not.
4733744	4734665	What were you playing it on?
4734685	4735145	What system?
4736398	4741161	I haven't been playing it, that's why I don't like it.
4741221	4745064	I'm sorry, I'm thinking of a different game.
4746104	4746525	It's alright.
4746825	4748246	It's getting late over here, too.
4748806	4753989	Alright, well, anything else you wanted to share with us quickly tonight before we let you go?
4757492	4758472	Not really, I don't think so.
4758832	4759693	Alright, well, that's alright.
4759733	4760714	Thanks so much for calling.
4760754	4761914	It was certainly an entertaining call.
4761934	4762835	We appreciate it, okay?
4763596	4764097	I hope so.
4764437	4764717	All right.
4764737	4767159	Let's see if I can catch some other shows some other time.
4767380	4767640	All right.
4767680	4768180	Sounds good.
4768360	4774406	And we know you have to stay up late to listen live, so we appreciate that true fandom over there overseas on this other side of the pond.
4775507	4775767	Yeah.
4775987	4776548	Two ponds.
4776868	4777088	All right.
4777108	4777268	Oh, yeah.
4777288	4777769	That's right.
4778309	4781512	It was just a hop, skip, and a jump in an 18-hour flight, right?
4781592	4781832	All right.
4782293	4782853	Take care, buddy.
4783734	4783954	Yep.
4784054	4784395	Take care.
4784455	4784695	Later.
4785155	4785376	Bye.
4785496	4785736	Later.
4789022	4790044	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4801155	4801815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4822816	4827398	There's rumors going around that Rock Band may be an Xbox 360 timed exclusive game.
4827538	4840343	The reason being is because the invitation to their Rock Band E3 presentation had the Xbox 360 logo on there, but amazingly enough, the PlayStation logo was not on there.
4841043	4841863	Could it be a mistake?
4842644	4842984	I don't know.
4843444	4850867	Although I know from all the videos that we've seen from, I think, the EA event, the game was being played on an Xbox 360 dev kit.
4851974	4854796	Stuntman Ignition Atari Classics Gamefly
4879514	4895060	So in the past we've noticed that of course Gamefly has a lot of titles of stuff that have leaked like beautiful Katamari before people notice or before they have the official announcement.
4896161	4897481	Let's see what else here.
4898222	4904224	There's a rumor also going around that Mario Kart Wii may be coming out this year but in Europe.
4905044	4906125	The rumor is that
4907270	4909552	The US will be getting Smash Bros.
4909652	4914195	Brawl in 07 and Mario Kart in 08.
4914315	4916277	Whereas Europe will be getting the opposite.
4916617	4919259	Mario Kart in 07 and Smash Bros.
4919299	4919379	in 08.
4919599	4919979	What is this?
4920039	4921420	Nintendo's apology to Europe?
4921440	4922241	I don't know.
4922281	4923462	I want fucking Mario Kart.
4923482	4924643	Fuck this Smash Bros.
4924683	4924863	shit.
4924903	4926644	You can all wait for Smash Bros.
4926744	4928706	I don't want my cake and I'm going to eat it too.
4928726	4929246	I want both cakes.
4929266	4930247	I want more Mario Kart.
4930887	4932469	And then...
4933659	4940663	Battalion Wars 2 has been pushed back to October 29th.
4940683	4946866	What makes that interesting, though, is there's no Wii game coming out in September.
4948227	4962194	So if you think about it, and this is all speculation, but if you think about it, and they wanted a pretty strong Wii title to compete against Halo 3 and whatnot, that would be the perfect prime spot for Super Smash Bros.
4962234	4962474	Brawl.
4963787	4964867	All right.
4965227	4965907	We'll see what happens.
4967268	4968048	Jamie, you have anything?
4968068	4968588	Because I don't.
4968628	4968808	No.
4969368	4969548	All right.
4970008	4970988	That was a very firm no.
4971009	4971909	All right.
4971929	4976130	Then let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts because we're going to wrap up here and end the show.
4977290	4979230	Thank you so much for being here, Jonas, Explicit.
4979270	4981231	I know you didn't get a chance to say too much tonight.
4981291	4981591	No problem.
4981631	4984911	I know you came in when things were already running, but we appreciate you helping out with Listless.
4985311	4987932	Any last final thoughts for our listeners?
4988872	4991413	Well, I understand you guys wanted to go to E3.
4991553	4992733	I mean, there's always next year.
4993093	4993433	That's right.
4994252	4994772	Some other year.
4994792	4995232	That's okay.
4995252	4995833	We're having fun.
4996113	4999094	We're having fun stomping and throwing a fit this year.
4999114	4999534	It's fine.
5000875	5003296	Wait, by the way, was it FU's of the week earlier today?
5003316	5003856	I missed them.
5003876	5004977	They were early in the show.
5004997	5005897	I'm sorry to say.
5006137	5006957	I'm not angsty, so.
5007017	5009579	Oh, I was going to say you can quickly throw one out as your final thought.
5010139	5015181	Well, the only FU I had was Anime Expo 07's organization this year.
5016562	5021984	Being an owner organized and having the staff pro screwed all over for everybody else.
5022683	5022903	All right.
5022923	5023744	Especially with the scheduling.
5023984	5026125	I have not been hearing good things about what went down there.
5026145	5032309	And of course, everyone heard about the whole petition of trying to move Anime Expo 08 out of Los Angeles Convention Center.
5032850	5033170	Wow.
5033710	5042516	Yes, there's been extreme amounts of debates over it, being how it's unsafe, and how the hotels are like two blocks away from them.
5043356	5044657	I say move it back to Disneyland.
5045878	5046498	They love that.
5046798	5047279	Oh, yeah.
5047679	5048339	Oh, hell no.
5048399	5049260	That was a nightmare.
5050384	5053826	DarkSakura, your final thought?
5054586	5055806	I'm going to Disneyland, bitches.
5058087	5064890	My final thought is I want candy very badly, even though I shouldn't be eating more candy, but I really want candy.
5065570	5067131	Don't forget about Sack Enemy this week.
5067491	5068212	I won't, I won't.
5068492	5069412	Loki, your final thought?
5069532	5070753	Last but certainly not least, Loki.
5072773	5073454	I have a kitty.
5075254	5076655	Named after an Atari emulator.
