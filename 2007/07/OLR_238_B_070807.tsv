0	4760	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream
4760	5760	twice weekly.
5760	12240	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links
12240	15480	to websites with listings of past episodes.
15480	19960	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19960	22800	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday evening.
22800	27800	It is July the 8th of 2007 and of course Orange Lounge Radio tapes live on Sunday nights and
27800	32920	releases our show in two parts to our RSS feed twice weekly and about the time you're
32920	38160	getting this right now, E3 is going on and of course as we talked about in part A, one
38160	43600	of the things that Sony is most likely going to be announcing at E3 is a $100 price drop
43600	44960	for the PlayStation 3.
44960	49760	However, as we do record the show live on Sunday nights, sometimes things change as
49760	51080	the show is going on.
51080	52080	Yes, Loki?
52080	54200	Yes, it's not a secret anymore.
54200	55740	It is official.
55740	59960	They have announced that the PlayStation 3 will be dropping or I should say the PlayStation
59960	66560	360 system will be dropping to $499 actually this week.
66560	70640	The other announcement though is coming in August, they're going to be releasing the
70640	75920	80 gig model that's going to be also bundled with a retail copy of Motorstorm.
75920	79000	That is going to be at the $599 price point.
79000	84520	So everybody loves that $599 price point but at least it's nice to see that they're bundling
84520	87320	a game in there as well.
87320	92480	I don't know, a little bit more for your money but still not a whole lot.
92480	97680	But that's probably going to be announced again at E3 and during Sony's so-called
97680	102780	press conference but just thought we'd like to let you guys know about that.
102780	108080	Now onto other things, of course with E3 right around the corner, one thing that we loved
108080	111880	last year and they're doing it again is Microsoft is going to be doing that bringing
111880	119380	it home thing where they actually have videos and demos from the show floor almost.
119380	126960	Last year we got to play Test Drive Unlimited and MotoGP 2006 and there was one other one
126960	129440	in there, I don't know, fun stuff.
129440	133200	So this year though, who knows what we're going to get but we're going to get more
133200	139700	of that, more demos, more game trailers and stuff like that, more free themes hopefully
139700	143880	and also they're not the only ones doing that.
143880	148640	This year Sony is jumping on the bandwagon, so they say, and are going to be doing something
148640	151720	very similar on the PlayStation Network as well, you're going to have downloadable
151720	155160	demos and videos and whatnot.
155160	161240	So awesome, I can't wait to download new demos because I like playing demos.
161240	165320	Do you think, just indulge me here as silly as this thought might be, do you think that
165320	170420	Microsoft might pull out a price drop of their own?
170420	171760	Possibly.
171760	174560	They're not going to just be like, whatever.
174560	180080	I don't think they need to but now that Sony dropped their price, they might pull
180080	185940	that thing where we think that our price point, even though it's $399, is so competitive
185940	189240	with their price point but they might be going by the elites, still even though their elites
189240	192320	are $20 less supposedly.
192320	195360	Do you think they might throw in a free game or something to make them feel more lucrative?
195360	201080	They may throw in a free game, like maybe Halo, Forza, Halo, something like that.
201080	205400	I don't know if they'll do Halo but probably Forza or something but there may be a game
205400	209320	pack-in, there may be also a price drop.
209320	214640	I hope that they do a price drop, it might be pretty cool but I don't know.
214640	220560	Not guaranteeing anything but I think if they did, it would definitely help.
220560	226640	SSJ100Matt says, not until after Halo 3 comes out, would there be another price drop?
226640	233120	They very well might hold it off until after Halo comes out and just say, boom, here you
233120	238320	go, price drop, let's sell some systems.
238320	241600	Let's talk about real quickly another game that a lot of folks are anticipating that's
241600	244000	going to be getting a demo of its own, it's Blue Dragon.
244000	247640	Of course, a lot of folks are very excited about this because it's not very often you
247640	252760	get a Japanese-style RPG on an Xbox system but we're finally starting to see some this
252760	255960	year thanks to Eternal Sonata and of course Blue Dragon.
255960	259240	Eternal Sonata had a demo come out already but Blue Dragon will be getting a demo on
259240	263240	Xbox Live Marketplace July 20th.
263240	268920	There is a Dengeki online magazine in Japan that is claiming that a 1.1 gigabyte demo
268920	272200	is going to be coming out over here in the US on July 20th.
272200	275680	It's going to be a two-hour demo if this story is correct.
275680	278720	It's going to be a pretty intense demo.
278720	281080	It's only going to be available though for two weeks.
281080	283440	The demo will disappear on August 3rd.
283440	288360	So now it almost sounds like it's a beta test or something even though it's not an online
288360	289360	game.
289360	290360	So I don't know what the hell else to call it.
290360	291360	It's a limited-time demo.
291360	292360	Kind of interesting.
292360	296480	It's just an incentive for you to play it, I guess.
296480	298040	But a two-hour demo?
298040	299040	Really?
299040	300040	That's pretty cool.
300040	303400	That sounds like a really good idea, especially if the game is going to be a bunch longer
303400	304400	than that.
304400	308320	I think they're trying to give a percentage of the game to get an idea of it.
308320	312520	It is supposed to be one of the first Xbox 360 games that's on two disks.
312520	313520	Interesting.
313520	319720	And then I also think about your typical Xbox early adopter is not someone who's typically
319720	325240	into these type of Japanese RPGs because a lot of folks who have not picked up an Xbox
325240	329440	360 still, they do like these games and aren't impressed with the fact that Microsoft doesn't
329440	330440	have them out.
330440	334960	So maybe having a very long two-hour demo is kind of a way to show these folks who maybe
334960	340400	bought their Xboxes for the maddens and burnouts of the world, give them their really first
340400	344560	experience in a Japanese RPG and try to get some people sucked into the world through
344560	345560	that.
345560	346560	I don't know.
346560	347560	Just a thought.
347560	351080	Kind of go back a little bit with the whole PlayStation network doing almost like the
351080	355400	bring it home thing, I really do hope they do this because lately their downloads and
355400	358480	stuff and their content online has been pretty crappy.
358480	363920	And if they start kicking it up to maybe the Xbox Live level, that would be pretty awesome
363920	369500	and that would definitely help them because I know right now the 360, there's no shortage
369500	373040	of new demos and games coming out each week.
373040	378000	All right, well I will definitely be looking forward to the Blue Dragon demo and I'll
378000	379160	be downloading it.
379160	382360	I'm sure as a lot of you folks listen to the show, we'll be.
382360	392720	Well speaking of Xbox news, the Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be, excuse me, actually
392720	400200	launched in Japan on October 11th and the price is going to be 47,800 yen, which in
400200	406160	US dollars is 390, so they're getting it cheaper than we did.
406160	407160	Good for them I guess.
407160	411520	Well I guess they need to be selling more Xboxes over in Japan, so why not release it
411520	412520	deep, eh?
412520	413520	They're trying.
413520	417800	All right, well if you're in Japan and you've been holding out for an Xbox 360, maybe now
417800	419680	is the time, who knows.
419680	425660	Well, kind of continuing on with the trend of exclusive games being lost, or not exclusive
425660	431040	games being lost, but becoming exclusive for the 360 or being delayed on the PlayStation
431040	436120	3, Fatal Inertia, this game has been delayed for a while, it's supposed to be I think a
436120	444480	launch title for the PlayStation 3 and now it's finally going to be coming out in September.
444480	449800	Now the only problem though is the PlayStation 3 version has been delayed indefinitely, so
449800	457160	the Xbox 360 one will be arriving September 11th on my birthday, awesome, and PlayStation
457160	462800	3 possibly later on if it's not canceled by then.
462800	463800	Very interesting.
463800	467720	I mean, there's been plenty of games like this, Splinter Cell, Devil Agent, Ghost Recon
467720	474800	Advanced Warfighter 2, hell, Rainbow Six Vegas, just kind of continuing the trend that the
474800	479560	PlayStation 3 is hard to develop for.
479560	486860	This is very interesting, kind of taking another topic here from Xbox 360 world, Forza 2.
486860	490040	You know, you can create your own cars in Forza 2, right?
490040	493800	And you can create these cars and you can actually sell them in their little online
493800	494800	auction.
494800	499520	Well, I'm surprised it took this long for a story like this to come out, but some knucklehead
499520	506400	has put up this car that says, White Power, Hail Hitler, you know, all that crap.
506400	510760	It's probably some 13-year-old trying to look cool, which this is not cool, but you know,
510760	514080	somebody made this car and put it up, there's a huge swastika on the hood and everything,
514080	519520	ah, just all this crap, they put up there on the little online marketplace thing within
519520	522520	Forza, a little online auction where you can buy the cars.
522520	527440	And of course, one of the blogs, it looks like 360 Gamer, got a picture of it, put it
527440	531640	on the internet, of course this exposes this whole problem to what happens when you let
531640	534800	users sell their custom-created cars on the game.
534800	540320	I'm surprised it's this and not, you know, a giant twat on the hood of a car or something,
540320	542280	it's all sorts of offensive things.
542280	545120	Fuck me in the butt, like, written on the side of the car.
545120	548400	I mean, this is just the tip of the iceberg, folks.
548400	552280	So how exactly do you stop this from happening?
552280	555120	Does a set of eyes have to look at every car that goes up?
555120	559000	Do you just allow this kind of shit to go on there and hope that people will warn or
559000	560000	whatever they need to do?
560000	565520	What you need to do is they should have something, you know, report abuse or report, you know,
565520	567680	this as a, you know, something like that.
567680	571600	You know, if it's, do you think if it's breaking, you know, the terms of service or whatever,
571600	576520	have it be reported and then they can take it down, you know, kind of like eBay.
576520	580120	You know, and of course, Microsoft has their whole little online user policy that says
580120	585200	you won't use our services to discriminate against, you know, somebody for a race or
585200	588640	whatever, even though whenever you sign on to Xbox Live and you play some online game,
588640	597560	it's usually, you know, NNNNFFFF and all those, you know, words getting dropped like crazy.
597560	603520	Part of the charm, and I say that with over sarcasm there, the charm of Xbox Live, that's
603520	605760	why I only play Xbox Live with friends.
605760	610040	I very rarely will play Xbox Live with strangers, and I rate every single one of them too.
610040	613600	If I play Xbox Live with strangers, they get rated by me every time I rate them good or
613600	614600	I rate them bad.
614600	622000	It'll be interesting to see if Sony, what Sony does in their whole future plan for online
622000	624000	gaming as well.
624000	626960	Well, other stuff.
626960	627960	Yes.
627960	628960	Yes.
628960	634320	Other stuff has to do with Gears of War, the soundtrack.
634320	641240	Usually the game is so popular that they are releasing the score to the game on soundtrack,
641240	646000	you know, with tracks such as Train Ride to Hell.
646000	650240	Wow, if I had known there were more songs like that in Gears of War, I might have tried
650240	654760	to play it longer, although it was kind of frustrating me like crazy.
654760	655760	You know what?
655760	660100	They've been doing soundtracks to video games for years in Japan, and we're just now getting
660100	663160	all this goodness, just in recent years.
663160	667800	We've had some, like you'll get like spotty, like Gran Turismo 2 had a soundtrack, I remember
667800	668800	that.
668800	669800	We do get the Silent Hill soundtracks over here.
669800	673240	Yeah, they're very spotty, but you see them once in a while, but of course you think in
673240	676960	Japan, my god, like every role-playing game that's major that come out of there has a
676960	680320	deluxe soundtrack that comes out, five-disc Chrono Trigger soundtrack.
680320	684320	With art books attached to them, like my Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack.
684320	687700	Kind of interesting that over here you get a Gears of War soundtrack, but you know, the
687700	690600	game's still insanely popular, it's always in that top ten list of the lightest.
690600	694280	Oh, they're doing this though, because these games come out, well I'd be like, well I really
694280	699920	want the music to this, and you know, I've actually got the new whatever Mana game just
699920	700920	came out soundtrack.
700920	705560	Or how about like Grand Theft Auto, you know, Vice City.
705560	708960	But that was all like actual, you know, radio music.
708960	712680	How sad that they never came out with a box set for Grand Theft Auto 3, that had some
712680	716520	pretty good stuff, especially on that like techno trance station that they had on there.
716520	719640	I think that iTunes also opens the doors for a lot of this too, because there's more and
719640	721520	more game music on iTunes lately.
721520	725360	Like you know, I know we had a story a few weeks ago about how Konami put a lot of their
725360	730580	old classic songs up there, so it's kind of neat what you can find online, and shopping
730580	732360	online as well.
732360	739320	Anyways, interesting things you can find online, excuses as to why the Red Rings of Death come
739320	741000	up on your 360.
741000	745520	One such excuse apparently is surge protectors.
745520	752960	This is coming from gamepolitics.com, apparently somebody has been, or got a response back
752960	758880	from Microsoft saying that the surge protector was the cause of the Red Rings of Death.
758880	763600	And the reason, because the 360 is highly sensitive to reductions in power, even the
763600	770140	slightest cut in power can cause things like the fans and DVD laser to malfunction.
770140	775400	Surge protectors can cause this, and probably 90% of the consoles they've seen fail in
775400	779600	6-12 months of being plugged into a surge protector.
779600	786480	I call bullshit, since I believe the problem with 360's air malfunctioning is overheating,
786480	793440	or actually the heat sink on the graphics chip becoming dislodged somehow because it
793440	798040	gets so hot that the actual solder melts.
798040	804760	So I'm not buying it, who cares, they're fixing it, there's a 3 year damn warranty
804760	805760	on the things.
805760	809880	Yes, we'll be talking more about that later on in the show, Microsoft's response to the
809880	813320	whole Red Rings of Death thing, but first a game, let's play a game, because it's a
813320	816880	little bit of a slow news week thanks to E3 being right around the corner, I mean there
816880	821200	has been some big news this week as things start to leak out before E3, but during a
821200	824200	slow news week we like to play a game, so tonight we're going to play a little bit of
824200	829380	Listless.
829380	833320	And the way that Listless works you guys, we're going to be creating the definitive
833320	838160	list around a certain topic, and the 3 hosts here in studio are going to play, and Jonas
838160	841360	is here with us, we haven't heard a lot from him in this segment, but he's been sitting
841360	844760	here in studio with us, joined us during part 8, he's here with us, how you doing Jonas?
844760	845760	Doing fine, you?
845760	848480	Alright, very good, explicit, also known as in the online world.
848480	850360	And you're going to be going to SacAnime this weekend too.
850360	854280	Yes, and of course I've talked to you guys about SacAnime, not sure if you guys are going
854280	855280	to be able to make it.
855280	858120	We'll be there, we don't know about the panel yet though, so let us know.
858120	860680	I'll try as much as I can to get you to get the panel there.
860680	864280	For the whole 3 people in Sacramento listening to this program, because this is a worldwide
864280	865280	show, but we're hoping to get more.
865280	866280	That's why we're going.
866280	868280	Yeah, I can help promote this stuff.
868280	869280	Alright, sounds awesome.
869280	872240	Alright, well anyway, we'll talk about that later, but tonight we're going to talk about
872240	878940	Listless, and tonight's topic is the most random thing we'd like to see at E3 this year.
878940	884440	Now this is how it's going to work, now you can do serious things, crazy things, stupid
884440	886640	things, there is no limitation.
886640	890200	You can be serious, you can be stupid, it doesn't matter because ultimately it will
890200	891800	be in the hands of the chat room.
891800	896320	The way this is going to work, I will name my top 3, as will Dark Sakura, Loki, and Explicit.
896320	899440	Is this like a game or just events or things?
899440	902560	It could be anything, it could be an event, something that happens at a press conference
902560	905120	or it could be a game that's announced or whatever.
905120	909080	So anyway, chat room, if you'd like to make some suggestions, you can start yelling those
909080	913260	out in chat, but chat, you'll actually play an important part, because once we name our
913260	917580	3 lists, then the fun part comes, we're going to go around and each one of us will take
917580	920300	something off of the list.
920300	924440	So that's going to leave us with a list of 8, in chat room you're going to vote for your
924440	928980	favorites, and we will come up with a definitive list based on the chat room vote, that's how
928980	931680	listless works.
931680	934880	This is an old game we used to do years ago on my college radio show, it's lasted this
934880	935880	long.
935880	940720	Alright, anyway, so again the topic tonight, the most random thing we'd like to see at
940720	944500	E3 this year, it doesn't matter, be serious, stupid, whatever you want, because the chat
944500	946880	room will ultimately decide what it's going to be.
946880	950400	So let's start it off, explicit, you're our guest tonight, why don't you start us off,
950400	955520	what would be the third most random thing you'd like to see at E3 this year?
955520	957720	Bill Gates getting pied in the face.
957720	962120	Bill Gates getting pied in the face, ok of course that happened once, ok, so it's kind
962120	966320	of, kind of, like go back to, go back to good old times, where you know, people would pie
966320	971400	Bill Gates in the face, ok I like this, I'm going to write that, pie Bill Gates, and what's
971400	974840	what's with the, why do you think someone would want to pie him in the face at E3?
974840	979920	Well I mean it has happened before, ok, and you know everyone's talking about the red
979920	980920	rings of death.
980920	984400	Oh so you think someone will like, you know maybe a cherry pie, to put a red ring of death
984400	985400	on his face.
985400	986400	Yes.
986400	988840	Actually I shouldn't say that because somebody's going to totally misinterpret that.
988840	993120	We don't mean someone should actually do this, but it would be kind of, it might happen.
993120	998040	Come on, pies in the face are funny, that's what Bozo the Clown used to do.
998040	1002160	Alright, but if you actually do it, it's your ass that's going to jail.
1002160	1007160	Alright anyhow, low key, if you would, your number 3 thing you would most like to see
1007160	1008960	happen at E3?
1008960	1018000	Nintendo actually releases online games, or games that are online, Nintendo actually releases
1018000	1022420	an online game to the shock and awe of many, we knew, oh god this is inevitable, somebody
1022420	1024760	was going to drop that one on us.
1024760	1031400	Alright, say no more, alright, well let's see, I'm going to go next, because we'll save
1031400	1035800	the best for last, Jamie.
1035800	1039920	Alright my number 3 thing I would like to see happen at E3, I would like to see Sega
1039920	1044440	publicly apologize for what they did to the Sonic franchise, I would like to see Sega
1044440	1050840	have a press conference and go look, our bad, so that's my number 3 thing.
1050840	1054480	Um, my number 3, if you're ready.
1054480	1058560	I am, I was just typing that into the computer, Sega publicly apologized for Sonic, alright
1058560	1059560	yes.
1059560	1069680	I'm showing up killing everyone from G4.
1069680	1073200	Lovely so Pyramid Head will come in there with his sexy self and kill everyone from
1073200	1078880	G4, not really, because again we don't want to get sued or watched by the FBI or anything,
1078880	1084000	we don't really mean that, but Pyramid Head could, you know, come in there and lay the
1084000	1086800	smack down, this is silly or random.
1086800	1090720	Alright, I hope the chatroom lighted, the Rob D says that is pretty random.
1090720	1095880	Alright, uh, Jonas, your number 2 most random thing you'd like to see happen at E3.
1095880	1100880	Alright, okay, um, I have the sense of this because Jamie said the person is banned in
1100880	1101880	Orange Dawn's radio.
1101880	1108320	Alright, uh, if it's, if the initials are JT, he who shall not be named, you can use
1108320	1110800	that or Voldemort.
1110800	1113600	Him showing up at E3.
1113600	1121600	So Voldemort attends E3.
1121600	1124400	That would be pretty random, what would he be doing at E3, because you know the rumor
1124400	1127960	is he was going to go to Penny Arcade Expo but they couldn't work out an agreement there,
1127960	1130760	so what would Lord Voldemort be doing at E3?
1130760	1133720	Who knows, he'd probably try to censor as many games as possible.
1133720	1137920	He'd be carrying the pie, that's what it is, that's what will happen.
1137920	1141320	Alright there you go, uh, Loki, your number 2 most random thing you'd like to see happen
1141320	1142320	at E3.
1142320	1148520	Uh, less of what I, this is more than likely going to happen, um, because, you know, stupid
1148520	1149760	things come out each year.
1149760	1155520	But more crappy games announced based off TV series, like, uh, Dancing with the Stars
1155520	1161000	or um, god, I don't know, are you smarter than a 5th grader?
1161000	1169000	Hey Paula the game, hey Paula the game, if there is a god in heaven, please do not make
1169000	1170440	this happen.
1170440	1175640	Hey Paula the game, uh, let's see, my number 2 thing I would like to see happen at E3,
1175640	1181400	I would like to see Nintendo not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.
1181400	1184520	That's what I'd like to see happen for once at E3, I'd like to see Nintendo not announce
1184520	1186680	one of their systems out in a new color.
1186680	1188320	I think that's self explanatory.
1188320	1189320	Jamie?
1189320	1197160	Number 2 should be we, um, be invited to be the official E3 podcasters.
1197160	1201400	So Jamie's showing a little bit of ego there, OLR the official ambassadors to the podcasting
1201400	1203560	universe for E3.
1203560	1208520	So I'm going to put OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors, is that good?
1208520	1211400	And why would they pick us?
1211400	1217180	Because of my boobs, I don't know.
1217180	1220720	So then ambassadors with emphasis on the ass.
1220720	1221720	Whatever.
1221720	1230120	Alright, OLR sells out at E308, uh, alright number 1, the number 1 thing you would like
1230120	1233320	to see happen at E3 this year, uh, explicit.
1233320	1240200	Okay, this might get me a little hated here, but um, Halo 3 delayed or cancelled.
1240200	1242560	Halo 3 delayed or cancelled, that would be pretty funny.
1242560	1247040	This would be funny, I wanted to see the, what the families would say about this if
1247040	1249040	they say it was delayed.
1249040	1253240	I don't, I don't actually see it, but remember this is random or whatever you want, so this
1253240	1256880	is your little sick fantasy is that you want to see the Halo fanboys have a cry.
1256880	1259880	Loki the number 1 thing you would like to see happen at E3 this year.
1259880	1263440	This honestly is something I really hope to see.
1263440	1267280	Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.
1267280	1271200	And it actually sticks.
1271200	1274680	Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date, or they could come out and say it's out today.
1274680	1283000	Oh my god, if they did that on Xbox Live Arcade, oh, oh, that would be awesome.
1283000	1289680	My number 1 thing is that I would like to see at E3 all the old Kensha Hall exhibitors
1289680	1292000	picketing outside the auditorium.
1292000	1301160	Or how about like, you know, pickaxes and torches and...
1301160	1304760	Because they're chanting, hell no, we won't go, and all that stuff.
1304760	1307760	Alright, Jamie, your number 1 thing.
1307760	1312200	Sky's voice the game.
1312200	1313800	Please explain this classic O.L.
1313800	1316680	Aryan joke for the sake of our new listeners.
1316680	1322240	It was Rob singing Bumblebee with different lyrics.
1322240	1324560	So Konami announces Sky's voice the game.
1324560	1325560	Yeah.
1325560	1327040	It's their latest in their Bomani series.
1327040	1328960	Thank you, my ego feels good for that.
1328960	1333200	Alright, there we go, so let's recap the big list we have here.
1333200	1334200	This is very wordy, you guys.
1334200	1336960	You might have to kind of lean in a little bit to see this, but I'll make the font bigger
1336960	1338800	there so we can all read.
1338800	1343840	Let me just kind of make that nice and easily readable.
1343840	1344840	Or not.
1344840	1345840	Alright.
1345840	1346840	Your arm's in the way, Rob.
1346840	1347840	That was hard to read.
1347840	1348840	I'm sorry, guys.
1348840	1349840	We'll, of course, post this in chat.
1349840	1351940	I can see if your arm wasn't there.
1351940	1353240	I'm working on it.
1353240	1356840	Okay, I'm trying to separate some of these out a little bit, the ones that went on two
1356840	1357840	lines.
1357840	1358840	Alright, here we go.
1358840	1360400	The list as it stands right now.
1360400	1362880	Most random things we'd like to see happen at E3 2007.
1362880	1365480	Pie Bill Gates in the face.
1365480	1367920	Nintendo actually releases an online game.
1367920	1370600	Sega publicly apologizes for Sonic.
1370600	1374880	Pyramid Head shows up and kills everyone from G4.
1374880	1377300	Lord Voldemort goes to E3.
1377300	1381900	More crappy games based off of TV series, like Hey Paula the Game.
1381900	1385720	Nintendo not announces one of their systems coming out in a new color.
1385720	1390360	OLR is named E3 Podcasting Ambassadors.
1390360	1393880	Halo 3 is delayed or canceled.
1393880	1396840	Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.
1396840	1400800	Kensha Hall's exhibitors picket outside the theater.
1400800	1404840	And Konami announces Sky's Voice the Game as the latest in the Bomani series.
1404840	1406600	It's a pretty good list.
1406600	1409580	But unfortunately, this list is not perfect.
1409580	1412960	So we need to go around and take ones off the list.
1412960	1415920	So explicit, we'll start with you.
1415920	1419720	Which one of these items is not worthy of being on the list?
1419720	1421520	They're all good, but...
1421520	1422520	This is hard tonight.
1422520	1423520	This is hard tonight.
1423520	1424520	Yeah, this is hard.
1424520	1425520	Hmm.
1425520	1426520	Oh, man.
1426520	1427520	Take something!
1427520	1435560	I guess I'll have to play the little dance music while Jonas thinks there.
1435560	1442840	I had to go with Nintendo and not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.
1442840	1443880	Because you know what's inevitable?
1443880	1445560	That's actually going to happen, right?
1445560	1446560	Yeah.
1446560	1450880	Alright, so explicit takes out the line about Nintendo will not actually...
1450880	1451880	Whatever.
1451880	1452880	It's gone.
1452880	1453880	Doesn't matter anymore.
1453880	1458880	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
1458880	1463840	No.
1463840	1465200	Bill Gates getting pied in the face.
1465200	1467960	Bill Gates is normally not really at these events too much, you know?
1467960	1470920	If it was like Peter Moore getting pied in the face, maybe.
1470920	1472480	I don't know.
1472480	1473480	Alright.
1473480	1474480	Let's see.
1474480	1475480	What would I like to put off the list?
1475480	1477120	I am going to pull off the list.
1477120	1481440	I'm going to pull off Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.
1481440	1484560	Because come on, it's the laughing stock of the industry and we can't have that ruined
1484560	1485560	at E3 this year.
1485560	1486560	It was a good thought.
1486560	1487560	It was a good one.
1487560	1488560	This is just hard.
1488560	1489560	It's a hard list.
1489560	1490560	It's a hard list.
1490560	1491560	So, Jamie gets the last to remove.
1491560	1493240	What are you going to take off the list?
1493240	1495200	He who shall not be named showing up at E3.
1495200	1496200	Yeah.
1496200	1497200	Because it ain't going to happen.
1497200	1498200	Yeah, we wouldn't want that.
1498200	1501000	It's invite only, bitch, and you're invited.
1501000	1502880	We don't get to crash this party.
1502880	1503880	Alright.
1503880	1505840	Incoming large paste into chat.
1505840	1509520	You guys are going to vote for your top two, your number one and your number two.
1509520	1510760	The order is important.
1510760	1512880	I will assume your first answer is the number one.
1512880	1517440	You're going to send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
1517440	1521320	You know, real quick, sorry, this is kind of an afterthought, but not on the list.
1521320	1527360	It'd be funny to see the people at Gamecock, the ones doing the EIO thing, to actually
1527360	1532640	have a Trojan rooster come to the E3 thing and try to see if they can get him to put
1532640	1533640	it in there.
1533640	1537800	Everyone will jump out and, you know, alright.
1537800	1541280	Here are our finalists for tonight's list list and we're going to open up voting to
1541280	1542680	the chat room right now.
1542680	1544480	Vote for your number one and number two picks.
1544480	1547680	We'll tally them up during the next few stories and reveal the answers to you later in the
1547680	1548680	show.
1548680	1549680	Here we go.
1549680	1550680	Things we'd like to see at E307.
1550680	1552760	Nintendo actually releases an online game.
1552760	1555640	Sega publicly apologizes for what they did to Sonic.
1555640	1558760	Pyramid Head shows up and kills everyone from G4.
1558760	1561320	More crappy games based off of TV series.
1561320	1564640	OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors.
1564640	1566760	Halo 3 delayed or canceled.
1566760	1569600	Kensha Hall exhibitors pick it outside the theater.
1569600	1570600	Sky's voice the game.
1570600	1572320	Why didn't I take that off the list?
1572320	1575200	Sky's voice the game announced by Konami.
1575200	1576760	Alright, there you have it.
1576760	1580280	Let's get back into the gaming news while the votes come in.
1580280	1583700	And I'll start off with a story here, kind of going to PC gaming, which we haven't talked
1583700	1584760	a lot about.
1584760	1588520	And the quintessential these days PC game, I mean, it is the most popular.
1588520	1589520	World of Warcraft.
1589520	1593560	And of course, if you're a World of Warcraft player, you know that gold farmers are a pain
1593560	1595160	in your ass.
1595160	1597600	And Blizzard did a good job with their latest patch though.
1597600	1602040	They really managed to squelch the amount of spam that was going out thanks to the limitations
1602040	1603760	they made on trial accounts.
1603760	1606440	But that just means the gold farmers have gotten a little more creative.
1606440	1610240	I am actually still getting tell spam once in a great while from gold farmers, but it's
1610240	1611560	gone way down.
1611560	1614920	But this has got to be one of the most creative things we've seen in a long time.
1614920	1623080	And that is that these folks now are creating level one gnome characters and killing themselves
1623080	1628240	in the main alliance town of Ironforge and spelling out the name of their website.
1628240	1632080	I'm not going to read the name of the website, but you can see pictures around the internet.
1632080	1636720	All these corpses laid out in like.com such and such site.
1636720	1640480	I don't want to plug the site because they're cunts for doing this to the game and need
1640480	1642680	to just stay the hell out of the game.
1642680	1645280	But you have to give them props at least for being creative.
1645280	1648840	Why can't we see this kind of advertising in real life?
1648840	1654260	Blizzard, by the way, one of their reps wrote on their own forums, I ask that any player
1654260	1657600	that witnesses these to report them straight away.
1657600	1661480	If you feel so inclined, you can also post the realm name and zone here and I can see
1661480	1665160	what can be done about getting them handled that way.
1665160	1668760	Please once it's reported, leave the bodies alone, do not linger around or huddle near
1668760	1669760	the bodies.
1669760	1672640	In other words, don't give them the attention that they're looking for.
1672640	1677320	Apparently I read somewhere else, somebody actually caught one of these like midway through
1677320	1682520	like it stopped and like you just see all these bodies saying.com, you don't see the
1682520	1686080	rest of the site name because I guess the Blizzard folks banned the IPs for too long,
1686080	1688680	but kind of a creative way to get around.
1688680	1690080	If nothing else, it's very creative.
1690080	1693720	I'll give them that even if they are annoying as hell.
1693720	1698640	Going to the chat room, James Patrick says, that's awesome, dead body advertising is great.
1698640	1702400	Sephiroth1215 says, yeah, it kind of sucks, but for those sad lives of WoW players, it
1702400	1703400	is really funny.
1703400	1704400	Hey, wait a minute.
1704400	1705400	That's me you're talking about.
1705400	1706400	Jerk.
1706400	1707400	All right.
1707400	1708400	More news.
1708400	1709400	Well, I tell you votes.
1709400	1717520	Well, for anyone who plays Second Life, apparently there is now going to be a build of Tokyo
1717520	1722880	in Second Life done by Tetsuya Mizuguchi.
1722880	1731560	He's doing actually a reimagined Tokyo for the I'm trying to actually get a little bit
1731560	1732560	more on that.
1732560	1733560	Right.
1733560	1737560	They're doing it actually completely recreated Tokyo from what it's saying.
1737560	1744440	He wants to do what Tokyo appears to both locals and visitors, something that's a matter
1744440	1746080	of perception.
1746080	1751160	So as he's quoted, actually saying a museum of Japanese pop culture.
1751160	1754000	So yeah.
1754000	1755000	Kind of interesting.
1755000	1756000	I'd like to see how that turns out.
1756000	1757000	Yes, very.
1757000	1759720	Even though I don't really want to play Second Life.
1759720	1766320	Anyways, interesting thing also coming to PCs, Dead or Alive Online is coming to PCs
1766320	1771640	pretty soon and it's supposed to be a brand new game in the series.
1771640	1777080	It won't just be some stupid port and so yeah, you will be able to see the Dead or
1777080	1784680	Alive jubilees, I guess, bouncing up and down on your PC in high res.
1784680	1785680	Hooray.
1785680	1787840	But you like that, yes?
1787840	1788840	Oh yeah.
1788840	1789840	Don't get me wrong.
1789840	1790840	It's awesome.
1790840	1797560	Unfortunately, as it is on PC, it's been done before by other companies and they've actually
1797560	1803000	had it where you can strip clothes off of people and stuff while you're fighting in
1803000	1804000	the game.
1804000	1809360	Well, hey, this Dead or Alive game, of course, there's a lot of Dead or Alive games on the
1809360	1814240	Xbox 360, but thanks to the red rings of death, some folks have not been able to play them.
1814240	1819040	Well, the internet threw a fit, even the UK was starting to investigate Microsoft and
1819040	1822580	finally Microsoft this week said, all right, enough.
1822580	1823580	We fucked up.
1823580	1824800	We're sorry.
1824800	1827720	Peter Moore came out and said, quote, you've spoken and we've heard you.
1827720	1830880	Good service and a good customer experience are areas of the business that we care deeply
1830880	1831880	about.
1831880	1834280	Basically, we've not been doing a good enough job.
1834280	1839460	As of today, all Xbox 360 consoles are covered by an enhanced warranty program to address
1839460	1843520	specifically the general hardware failures indicated by the three flashing red lights
1843520	1844600	on the console.
1844600	1847360	This applies to new and previously sold consoles.
1847360	1851760	So in other words, for three years, and the Xbox 360 hasn't even been out that long yet,
1851760	1852760	your console's covered.
1852760	1855600	If you get the three rings of death, you don't have to pay to have it fixed.
1855600	1858800	That means all the people who bought extended warranties.
1858800	1861120	Well, they may cover other failure.
1861120	1865160	This is only for the three red rings of death, so the extended warranty does cover all the
1865160	1869960	other things that could go wrong, but certainly a lot of folks are applauding Microsoft for
1869960	1870960	this move.
1870960	1873520	Now, it would be nice if the three red rings of death would never show up in the first
1873520	1877880	place, but since Microsoft can't magically cure all the 360s that are already out there,
1877880	1880520	I suppose this is the next best thing.
1880520	1885280	Any thoughts from the folks here in studio on the whole warranty policy change?
1885280	1886680	I think it's pretty cool.
1886680	1891520	Glad to see that they're actually covering this stuff anyways.
1891520	1895320	And then hopefully, I'm assuming since the rumors have been going around that they're
1895320	1900680	redesigning the cooling on it, that this will fix the problem, and any of these consoles
1900680	1904520	that are still out there that are failing because of this will get fixed, and we won't
1904520	1906080	have to hear about it anymore.
1906080	1910120	Apparently Peter Moore has actually joined our chat room, or someone impersonating him.
1910120	1915160	Peter Moore says, we're sorry, have this three year warranty for the three red lights.
1915160	1919240	See, one year for every light, there you go, bravo.
1919240	1920240	Nice.
1920240	1923320	So, there are three lights?
1923320	1925520	I guess, yeah, I got the error one time.
1925520	1928280	I'm joking, Rob.
1928280	1929280	I hate you.
1929280	1930280	You know what?
1930280	1931280	Mailbag segment's canceled tonight.
1931280	1932280	Okay.
1932280	1933280	You can read it.
1933280	1934280	No, I don't want to read it.
1934280	1936000	I had to read it last week because you weren't here.
1936000	1940000	When you send in your emails to mailbag at OrangeLivesReader.com, obviously we care very
1940000	1943160	deeply about your emails that you send in to us.
1943160	1945880	We fight over who gets to read them here on air.
1945880	1949300	Dark Sakura's going to open up the old mailbag and read some of her favorites for you right
1949300	1952160	here in the mailbag segment.
1952160	1953840	Dark Sakura, dive in head first.
1953840	1954840	Mailbag at OrangeLivesReader.com.
1954840	1955840	Pull some emails out.
1955840	1957560	What'd you get?
1957560	1959840	The first one comes from Devin.
1959840	1965320	Dear Rob, Jamie, and Loki, last week you put out the call for developers to listen to the
1965320	1967980	show to write in, and in that regard, I qualified.
1967980	1972380	Three weeks ago, I started working at Bottle Rocket Entertainment.
1972380	1979000	The team responsible for the Mark of Kree and its sequel on PS2 as an environment artist.
1979000	1980000	Oh, that's cool.
1980000	1983800	For the people unsure what that entails, it's pretty much what it sounds like.
1983800	1986600	Environment artists build the art assets for the level in the game.
1986600	1990840	Since I just started recently, I have no grizzled words from the trenches of the horrors of
1990840	1994000	game development, but I wanted to write in anyway as I've been listening to your show
1994000	1995000	since last fall.
1995000	1997720	Actually, I wanted to thank you guys for the work that you do.
1997720	2002600	I listen to OLR and other podcasts at work, and it makes my day that much more enjoyable.
2002600	2006200	In fact, aside from the caffeine, I basically had to subsist on podcasts to get me through
2006200	2009160	the last bit of art school before I got this job.
2009160	2014000	I love OLR in particular because your enthusiasm for your program shows, and as a result, every
2014000	2016600	episode is guaranteed to entertain.
2016600	2018600	Thank you for all the work you put into this.
2018600	2019600	One last thing.
2019600	2024000	My point of view of game development might be somewhat myopic at this point, but I know
2024000	2027060	people have questions, and I might be able to provide some answers.
2027060	2030520	I can't talk about anything related to the projects we're working on, but if any of your
2030520	2033760	listeners want to know what it's like working in a game company or how best to break into
2033760	2038160	the industry or anything like that, I might be able to help just putting that out there.
2038160	2039320	Sincerely yours, Devin L.
2039320	2042240	Well, maybe we'll have to have Devin on the show at some point.
2042240	2043240	Ask a developer.
2043240	2044240	That might be kind of fun.
2044240	2045240	That'd be cool.
2045240	2048200	But that's kind of neat to know that people on the inside are listening to the program,
2048200	2051600	and that always makes us feel pretty good, you know.
2051600	2055760	And certainly we were talking about the guy that worked for the Japanese developer.
2055760	2057680	He actually was sending me some pictures from Japan.
2057680	2059000	I actually have to show you.
2059000	2061960	He sent me some pictures from a pinball arcade in Japan, so I have to show you.
2061960	2062960	Nice.
2062960	2063960	So, kind of cool.
2063960	2066920	So thank you to the developers that listen to this show, just like any other listener.
2066920	2067920	We really appreciate your support.
2067920	2071240	Well, we got one from the Rob D. Yes.
2071240	2074520	I was listening to last week's show on the way home from work yesterday, and yes, my
2074520	2078880	end quiz will label you as super spastic if you suck in that game.
2078880	2082800	I'm always amused when an issue with this word comes up, because it shows a giant cultural
2082800	2086240	divide between the USA and the UK that no one is really aware of.
2086240	2090120	For whatever reason, the word spaz is highly offensive in the UK, even to the point of
2090120	2095120	the Spastic Society, a nonprofit organization to aid those with cerebral palsy, changing
2095120	2096840	its name to SCOPE.
2096840	2101240	In the US, the surfer lingo of the SoCal area made the word spaz a common insult among youth
2101240	2102240	to this date.
2102240	2108280	A few years ago, Tiger Woods got in huge trouble with his UK fans when he said that he had
2108280	2112240	played the best I've played for years, and as soon as I got on the green, I was a spaz
2112240	2113960	during last year's Masters.
2113960	2115920	Of course, Americans had no idea what the problem was.
2115920	2120360	Merriam-Webster doesn't even mention cerebral palsy and its definition of the word spaz.
2120360	2124080	A little side note, whenever I hear spastic, I think of spastic, colon.
2124080	2126560	Anyway, back to the email.
2126560	2129600	Although not the most popular, by far the worst and funniest documented case that's
2129600	2134300	happening is when an American wheelchair manufacturer decided to export one of their products to
2134300	2135600	Great Britain for sale there.
2135600	2140000	Unfortunately, the name of this product was called, I kid you not, the spaz with two Z's.
2140000	2147520	You can imagine how well that went over.
2147520	2151480	On one hand, I feel sort of bad for the wheelchair company, but the name was cool in the first
2151480	2152480	place.
2152480	2157480	Isn't that kind of like selling a walker and calling it gimpy or marketing head gear for
2157480	2161680	children with really bad teeth as the most unpopular kid in school brand?
2161680	2167560	Anyway, I guess the closest analogy I can make is if some Asian company wanted to make
2167560	2171360	a humorous shirt that said, I'm chicken on the front and accidentally, instead of using
2171360	2177500	the word cock instead of chicken, not realizing how offensive it is.
2177500	2178500	Great show.
2178500	2181040	I keep up and keep up the good work.
2181040	2184880	Maybe you'll actually get to 500 episodes like I accidentally said you already had on
2184880	2185880	your five-year show.
2185880	2186880	Rob D.
2186880	2191640	You know, I find the term scope offensive because it makes me think of mouthwash, which
2191640	2196100	in turn makes me think of the dentist and I find dentist to be highly offensive because
2196100	2199480	of what they charge me when I go in there to have my teeth cleaned.
2199480	2201640	So I find that term to be offensive.
2201640	2206160	So obviously I'm just messing around, but you know, we learned, we learned a lot about
2206160	2208600	some of those cultural word differences last week.
2208600	2212200	You know, I had no idea that that was an offensive term over there, but you know, it's just a
2212200	2215640	part of the world we live in and all those funny little cultural differences.
2215640	2218880	So more stuff, more stuff.
2218880	2226240	Oscar once again, thank you, um, and yeah, Rob, you were drunk, quit denying your past.
2226240	2228320	I do this time.
2228320	2229320	I'm just going to read.
2229320	2230320	I swear.
2230320	2231320	I wasn't drunk.
2231320	2233720	I think that's what anybody thinks.
2233720	2237000	Thanks a lot for introducing me to the song anniversary from powder, powder, paradise
2237000	2238120	with a question mark.
2238120	2242440	I've been listening to it every day, multiple times a day, bolded ever since.
2242440	2243440	Yeah.
2243440	2244440	Can you tell that I love it?
2244440	2245440	So yay for Rob.
2245440	2246440	Rob is cool.
2246440	2247440	Rob fan mail for the wind.
2247440	2248440	Yay.
2248440	2249760	I want to get Loki or Jamie out.
2249760	2250760	So you all kick ass.
2250760	2251760	Smiley face.
2251760	2252760	I'm boo.
2252760	2253760	I want to be by myself.
2253760	2260200	Rob, your beloved listener, Oscar PS supernova location test back on.
2260200	2262960	Maybe during the time it was canceled, they made the game better.
2262960	2263960	Thoughts.
2263960	2264960	EMUs maybe.
2264960	2269240	Uh, wasn't there some news on the whole supernova testing this week?
2269240	2270360	Like it's back on now.
2270360	2275320	In fact, I think it was posted to our own site, but that was the wonderful, the wonderful
2275320	2277920	dark Tetsuya actually stays on top of a lot of that stuff.
2277920	2278920	Apparently.
2278920	2279920	Yeah.
2279920	2282520	The supernova two test is back on again for July 12th, 2007.
2282520	2286840	That's funny because that would be right around the same time as E3, but yeah, that's what
2286840	2288760	is floating around the internet apparently.
2288760	2290320	All right.
2290320	2294480	So can I read more email please?
2294480	2295480	Of course.
2295480	2296480	Thank you sir.
2296480	2297480	May I have another?
2297480	2298800	Hi, Orange Launch Radio.
2298800	2300960	This is a quick email from Maury.
2300960	2305560	Um, unfortunately for the past two weeks, my computer has been relatively out of commission,
2305560	2308440	so I wasn't able to send along this message any sooner.
2308440	2310000	Excuses, excuses.
2310000	2315520	But congrats on five years and two weeks and two weeks of being on the air, uh, five years
2315520	2316520	and two weeks as of today.
2316520	2317520	Yeah.
2317520	2320880	I've listened to your show for about a year and a half now and since the last few episodes
2320880	2324920	of the original OLR to go edition of the podcast, you guys are the only show that I can actually
2324920	2327840	sit down and listen to all the way without losing interest and short.
2327840	2328840	You guys are great.
2328840	2329840	Thanks.
2329840	2331080	And we have a tilde at the end of the things.
2331080	2332080	Thank you.
2332080	2336600	But besides that, a few weeks ago I heard someone mention the Sega Pico at one point
2336600	2337600	in the episodes.
2337600	2340600	I have fond memories of mine, which is currently sitting in a box in my closet.
2340600	2343600	I actually pulled it out and played around with it after hearing that basically it was
2343600	2345280	Sega and edutainment.
2345280	2349200	I did, however, have something vaguely resembling a touch pad, which I forgot about.
2349200	2352680	Any who, considering the apparently huge amount of systems Dark Sakura owns, by any chance
2352680	2354180	does she have one?
2354180	2358040	This has been something I've been wondering about for a while since obviously I have nothing
2358040	2359040	better to do.
2359040	2361420	Um, actually I do not own a Pico.
2361420	2366280	I came very close to purchasing a Pico at Toys R Us, but we bought a Nomad instead.
2366280	2370600	I figured Nomad Pico, you know, Nomad high on the pedestal.
2370600	2377240	However, I actually have been looking for a Pico since last week, but bills and I'm
2377240	2383200	going to Disneyland at the end of the month, so Disneyland greater than Pico.
2383200	2384200	Tea cups are better than Pico.
2384200	2388320	I know and I'm going to freaking ride the hell out because the tea cups go faster at
2388320	2389320	night, Rob.
2389320	2392480	I'm going to get you for going to Disneyland on the weekend, I have to move, which in turn
2392480	2397440	will probably be no OLR that week, but you know, we're changing studios, so yes.
2397440	2400640	And in closing, thanks again for your awesomeness and I hope to actually call in on the show
2400640	2401640	one day.
2401640	2404360	Oh, and Sky's game tap promotion made me subscribe to it.
2404360	2408120	Not quite as big of a purchase as a $60 game, but still, I thought it was worth mentioning
2408120	2412260	Maury, possibly the second youngest listener at 14.
2412260	2417400	That doesn't help because people think I'm already like up there in bed with them, but
2417400	2418400	I swear I'm not.
2418400	2420560	I just, you know, think they're good.
2420560	2428760	Well, I have to say though, 14 and having, I have to say for a 14 year old, you have
2428760	2434540	some of the best grammar in an email I have ever seen.
2434540	2436720	Nothing was misspelled.
2436720	2439240	You had one typo.
2439240	2446220	I have to say that you are shining example of the educate, of our public education system
2446220	2449040	working unless you go to private school.
2449040	2450040	So who's this again?
2450040	2451040	Maury.
2451040	2453800	Maury, our listener of the week, everybody give it up.
2453800	2457500	You are the, you are the emailer of the millennium.
2457500	2460440	So there you go.
2460440	2465160	This one is by Schwall 22, I guess.
2465160	2469780	Hey guys, been a while since I've written and I had to create Loki's misuse of a word
2469780	2471280	last week.
2471280	2475280	When referring to a mentally handicapped person, it's a retard example.
2475280	2477720	That guy is a fucking retard.
2477720	2483520	When referring to music, that's r-i-t-a-r-d, short for retardando, which means to gradually
2483520	2485880	become slower.
2485880	2489800	I actually was the one last week that said that retard is used in music, but I knew it
2489800	2492480	was the misspelling, but you still say it the same way.
2492480	2494600	Well, that's just two different spellings, same pronunciation.
2494600	2496200	Oh well, keep up the good work.
2496200	2498360	I really have been enjoying the show.
2498360	2500840	Oh, oh, more people should play Overlord.
2500840	2501840	It's funny as hell.
2501840	2503840	Buy it so we get a sequel.
2503840	2504840	Okay.
2504840	2506840	Will do, chief.
2506840	2509960	Hey, Loki, retard your anger.
2509960	2512160	Next email, last email is from NintendoManiac64.
2512160	2518440	Hi, hola, bonjour, guten tag, konnichiwa, et cetera, although actually it's evening
2518440	2521480	for us, so it would be konbanwa, anyway.
2521480	2524800	Oh my god, picky lady.
2524800	2525800	This is me, Rob.
2525800	2526800	I'm gonna go get a water.
2526800	2528080	Oh, whatever.
2528080	2531680	This question is pretty much unrelated to OLR, but I may need the input by a largest
2531680	2536760	group of people, aka the chat room, and not be completely ignored due to the uber speed
2536760	2540520	that the comments travel at in the said chat room.
2540520	2546680	Anyway, I'm finally going to be in an M3 perfect, which is the slot two version to replace my
2546680	2550200	broken supercard CF, which had a connector pin.
2550200	2554400	This has nothing to do with the, well, you said it had nothing to do with the show.
2554400	2559720	Okay chat room, I'm just gonna read the question, okay.
2559720	2563680	It said, to replace my broken supercard CF, which had a connector pin and the CF slot
2563680	2564680	break off.
2564680	2567320	Yes, I tried to solder it back, and it still doesn't work.
2567320	2571160	My question is, if you or the chat room know if there are any mini or micro SD cards that
2571160	2578480	are four gigabyte but not SDHC, since the M3 perfect isn't compatible with SDHC.
2578480	2581880	I'm still not sure if I'm gonna get a two gig or a four gig SD card, but if there are
2581880	2588880	any four gigabyte mini or micro non-SDHC cards, my problem is solved right there.
2588880	2594720	And if anyone yells in the chat room and get an R4 or something, he needs 32 megabyte of
2594720	2595720	extra RAM.
2595720	2596720	Okay, whatever.
2596720	2597720	This has nothing to do with the show.
2597720	2600140	I'm not gonna read your answer.
2600140	2602320	Email people, okay.
2602320	2606480	Your answer, your question fails.
2606480	2610000	And we have an email from Sauce.
2610000	2612320	This says, dear Rob, there are four lights.
2612320	2613720	Love Tiara.
2613720	2614720	Yes.
2614720	2616640	There are four lights, but only three show.
2616640	2623920	I can't wait to play Rob's Voice the Game 2, Iraqi Suicide Babies.
2623920	2627520	I'm sorry, I left the room when I heard Nintendo Maniac 64 send an email, but then I heard
2627520	2628520	my name.
2628520	2629520	Just kidding, hearts.
2629520	2630520	What's that?
2630520	2631520	This email's from Sauce.
2631520	2632520	Dear Rob, there are four.
2632520	2636080	Yes, but when the system breaks, there's only three that come on.
2636080	2637800	But, but, but, but.
2637800	2638800	What's it say?
2638800	2639800	P.S.
2639800	2641400	I can't wait to play Rob's Voice the Game 2, Iraqi Suicide Babies.
2641400	2644720	Because four blinking lights means that your AVC is unplugged.
2644720	2648760	Best email ever, except for the 14-year-old that can spell shit.
2648760	2651760	All right, close the mailbag.
2651760	2653080	We're way over time.
2653080	2654360	Mailbag is belated.
2654360	2658800	All right, if you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelaundrado.com, and maybe
2658800	2661800	Jamie will make fun of you on air next.
2661800	2663160	Or compliment your grammar.
2663160	2665440	I would actually like to see, we should have a grammar contest.
2665440	2668880	Let's see if there's some 13 and 12-year-olds that want to send in some emails and try to
2668880	2669880	one-up Maury.
2669880	2671880	Wouldn't that be exciting?
2671880	2672880	Awesome.
2672880	2680080	So, anyways, I guess the ongoing quest to get Mother 3 translated is going pretty well.
2680080	2686960	Now two teams have kind of joined forces on the project, and I don't know.
2686960	2692600	No word on yet when it's going to be done, but, well, actually, no, I guess there was
2692600	2693600	a small update.
2693600	2702240	They said that they're shooting for a release this year, so, awesome, I guess?
2702240	2703240	I don't know.
2703240	2707520	Not much a fan of Mother 3, but, great.
2707520	2708740	I fucking love Earthbound.
2708740	2712020	Why doesn't Nintendo, I don't know, translate the game themselves?
2712020	2719040	Because they're dumbasses, because they would rather redo Pit Cross and release it on the
2719040	2720040	DS.
2720040	2721840	There's so much Nintendo hate tonight.
2721840	2723880	I apologize to the Nintendo fans, but I don't.
2723880	2724880	It's all right.
2724880	2726280	Next week will be Nintendo love.
2726280	2727280	That's true.
2727280	2733080	I know there's a lot of love for this this week.
2733080	2738120	Rock Band had some footage hit the internet, and a lot of folks were very, very happy about
2738120	2739120	this.
2739120	2741680	I'm going to play this in studio here, because I'm sure not everybody has seen it.
2741680	2742680	Oh, never mind, I can't.
2742680	2745960	It got taken off YouTube.
2745960	2750520	But basically, okay, imagine Guitar Hero side by side three times, then Karaoke Revolution
2750520	2751520	on top.
2751520	2756040	That's kind of what Rock Band looked like, and the video I guess was leaked to the internet,
2756040	2760320	so then Harmonics kind of had to step in and put something a little more legit out there
2760320	2764720	and kind of confessed to what was going on, and mentioned that the song that you heard
2764720	2768920	in there, Welcome to the Jungle, was just a demo song and may not actually be in the
2768920	2769920	final version of the game.
2769920	2771260	But that was so awesome.
2771260	2772480	It looked like a shitload of fun.
2772480	2773480	Did you guys see the clip?
2773480	2774480	Oh my God, yes.
2774480	2776000	Yeah, it looks good.
2776000	2780080	The only negative complaint I've heard on it is that maybe the karaoke part is too small,
2780080	2781840	which could be very hard to see on a regular TV.
2781840	2784280	I don't know about that, but it looked pretty good.
2784280	2788680	But doesn't everybody have a widescreen HDTV these days, huh?
2788680	2790160	It's not so much that, but shouldn't everyone...
2790160	2791760	Sony thinks so.
2791760	2793840	Shouldn't everyone know the lyrics to Welcome to the Jungle?
2793840	2795460	I mean, shouldn't you know this song by heart?
2795460	2797460	I don't know the lyrics.
2797460	2799160	Welcome to the Jungle!
2799160	2800900	Well yeah, I know parts of it.
2800900	2801900	I don't know...
2801900	2802900	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
2802900	2804320	See, I could just make it up.
2804320	2805320	I don't need the...
2805320	2808720	You know, there's other words in there too, but who cares?
2808720	2811040	Will this game let you cheat like Karaoke Revolution does?
2811040	2815240	No, they supposedly have a thing that detects the phonics in your voice, so that you're
2815240	2820200	not going to be able to go, you know, like, what was it?
2820200	2824640	It's the end of the world as we know it, where it's like, uh, you know, the whole song.
2824640	2826640	That's how I sing It's the End of the World as we know it in Karaoke Revolution.
2826640	2829640	Have you ever played any of the Japanese versions of Karaoke Revolution?
2829640	2830760	I have not.
2830760	2834000	They actually make sure that you are pronouncing everything right.
2834000	2835000	Wow.
2835000	2839280	They're very, very specific.
2839280	2840280	Let's see.
2840280	2842920	Rob D says that was the greatest rendition of Welcome to the Jungle ever.
2842920	2843920	Why they...
2843920	2847240	See why they want Sky's voice in the game?
2847240	2851520	Ego plus five right there.
2851520	2855600	Plus four strength, plus four stamina, plus four ego.
2855600	2859680	Act Deft says, is telling the Rob D, Harmonic says it won't be that expensive.
2859680	2864880	Oh, because the Rob D said Rock Band equals expensive game I won't be buying.
2864880	2865880	So I don't know.
2865880	2867240	It could be fun though.
2867240	2870040	Jamie will buy it because she loves those types of games.
2870040	2877080	Actually, I will probably get suckered into buying it like I did with Guitar Hero 2 and
2877080	2880640	then I won't play it again.
2880640	2881640	Gonna be good times.
2881640	2884960	I will not do the Karaoke portion of the game though.
2884960	2886760	I think I might.
2886760	2887760	Please.
2887760	2888760	No.
2888760	2890440	One time on the show do the Karaoke.
2890440	2891440	Never.
2891440	2892440	Please.
2892440	2893440	Can't you do Welcome to the Jungle?
2893440	2896160	No, but you just did such a wonderful rendition.
2896160	2897160	Oh, shut up.
2897160	2898160	I hate you.
2898160	2903080	Well, even though I hate Loki right now, I still love Jamie for now.
2903080	2907480	So I will allow her a chance to share with you all her website of the week because she
2907480	2908480	was out last week.
2908480	2911080	So she's got to make it extra good this week.
2911080	2912080	Dark Sakura.
2912080	2913080	I was dead sore last week.
2913080	2918440	Where should the kids be pointing their websites, browsers this week?
2918440	2927400	The website of the week is newsescue.com because it's Kevin Smith and I don't need to tell
2927400	2929400	you anything else.
2929400	2930680	It's freaking Kevin Smith.
2930680	2934920	So it's like news for View Askew, which is Kevin Smith's production company.
2934920	2936720	Yes, it's Kevin Smith.
2936720	2937720	So just go.
2937720	2940880	And there's a link on there for drinking games too for each of the movies.
2940880	2942400	Oh, that's fun.
2942400	2944680	I think that is really awesome.
2944680	2945680	Good times.
2945680	2946680	Newsescue.com.
2946680	2952300	There is a View Askew website and one of the others is moviepoopshoot.com.
2952300	2955040	One thing I always liked about Kevin Smith, from what I remember, because I was reading
2955040	2958720	up on Dogma a lot because I was really interested in that movie when it first came out and I
2958720	2963680	liked the movie a lot, I seem to remember that Kevin Smith will actually post on his
2963680	2964680	forums and stuff.
2964680	2973080	He's actually got a blog update too called My Boring Ass Life.
2973080	2977320	The internet did forgive him for Jersey Girl though, right?
2977320	2978320	I think so.
2978320	2979320	I think it's fair to say.
2979320	2980320	I never did see Clerks too though.
2980320	2981320	I should hang my head in shame.
2981320	2982400	I need to go rent it.
2982400	2983480	I do need to see it.
2983480	2984560	How did I miss it?
2984560	2986280	I just don't watch any movies anymore.
2986280	2987280	It's sad.
2987280	2989760	And Kevin Smith has a MySpace too.
2989760	2990760	Does he?
2990760	2991760	I should add him.
2991760	2992760	I love The Evening With Kevin Smith.
2992760	2994760	That's one of my favorite DVDs ever.
2994760	2995760	All right.
2995760	2996760	Newsescue.com.
2996760	3000080	Check it out when you're taking a break from the games.
3000080	3002080	Has Kevin Smith admitted he plays video games?
3002080	3003080	I would imagine he does.
3003080	3004080	He seems like a big nerd.
3004080	3005080	I don't think so.
3005080	3007640	Well, how come there hasn't been a Jay and Silent Bob video game?
3007640	3009440	That's what I want to know.
3009440	3010440	Maybe someday.
3010440	3011440	Good question.
3011440	3018960	Anywho, there's some interesting news coming from Australia.
3018960	3026880	Apparently a sort of affair between a 31-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy went awry and
3026880	3030300	she was arrested for kidnapping charges.
3030300	3038280	The whole thing took place over World of Warcraft where apparently the 31-year-old, I'm just
3038280	3044760	going to assume that she was a MILF, because she's, well, no, of course not.
3044760	3047480	Anyways, then again, if she's hitting on 17-year-old boys, who knows?
3047480	3048480	I know.
3048480	3049480	MILF?
3049480	3052600	Does that mean like mom is large and fat?
3052600	3055600	Is that MILF?
3055600	3066540	Anyways, so apparently she was creating this deep and trusting relationship with her barely
3066540	3069180	legal boyfriend for more than a year.
3069180	3073760	How do you form a deep and trusting relationship on World of Warcraft?
3073760	3080440	I will give you this four-strength, four-stamp leather belt if you will eat my pussy.
3080440	3081440	I don't know.
3081440	3086240	How do you do that?
3086240	3088240	Or I'll give you a Leeroy Jenkins.
3088240	3093320	Is that a new sexual term?
3093320	3095640	Is that what these two say during, oh, I shouldn't even say that.
3095640	3097640	I shouldn't use that, that's bad.
3097640	3098640	Never mind.
3098640	3106680	But anyways, apparently she was going to meet the boy and they were going, because she lived
3106680	3111640	in Australia, but she was going to meet him, I guess he lived out of country, and basically
3111640	3115920	take him with her and they were going to fly to Australia and he was going to live with
3115920	3116920	her.
3116920	3120680	Apparently, the parents found out about it and had her arrested.
3120680	3122760	Wait, so she was Australian?
3122760	3123760	Yeah.
3123760	3124760	Oh, wow.
3124760	3132160	What's wrong with you guys in Australia and your MILFs and, no, I'm just kidding, obviously
3132160	3134080	it's one bad apple ruining the barrel.
3134080	3140600	I'm sure the media hasn't gone crazy with this story about how World of Warcraft is
3140600	3146400	predator for children and blah, blah, blah, Dateline NBC special about the scary MILFs
3146400	3151360	on Warcraft reaching out, buying plane tickets for 17-year-old boys.
3151360	3158600	The boy lived in North Carolina, so I would assume that the age of consent, of course,
3158600	3161040	here is usually over 18.
3161040	3162040	That's a long plane ride.
3162040	3166360	He'll probably be 18 by the time he gets to Australia, so what's so wrong with that?
3166360	3169640	The time zone changes and the Dateline, you know?
3169640	3170640	Exactly.
3170640	3171640	He's 18.
3171640	3172640	Exactly.
3172640	3175840	All right, well we are just about done with all these stories for tonight and we are going
3175840	3179640	to be opening up the Skype line for you guys to call in and interact with our program.
3179640	3182200	If you want to give us a call, you can call us on Skype.

3186200	3187920	877 number.
3187920	3188920	That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3188920	3195920	That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3195920	3203400	We will take your calls very soon, however, first we have another score to settle and
3203400	3206480	that's tonight's List List.
3206480	3208400	We need to know who won tonight's List List.
3208400	3212720	The topic tonight, of course, most random things we'd like to see at this year's E3.
3212720	3216000	We have winners and let's reveal them now.
3216000	3219640	Number three, the number three thing our chat room would like to mostly happen to E3 this
3219640	3223800	year, Halo 3 gets delayed or canceled.
3223800	3227460	A lot of bitterness towards Halo 3 in our chat room.
3227460	3231460	The number two thing, according to the OrangeLoungeRadio listeners and therefore the definitive
3231460	3237520	number two thing that must happen at E3 this year, Konami announces Sky's Voice the Game.
3237520	3242600	The number two thing that happens this year and the number one thing that the folks would
3242600	3247080	like to see happen at E3 this year, so this must happen, this is the number one demand
3247080	3248080	of the people.
3248080	3252840	This is the people saying this must happen.
3252840	3256040	Pyramid Head must show up and kill everyone for E4.
3256040	3263200	There you have it, tonight's definitive List of the needs of E3 2007.
3263200	3269480	All right, let's open up the Skype line and take some calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3269480	3272440	Did they do a good job tonight, you think?
3272440	3274160	I think they did a good one, I don't know.
3274160	3277400	I think they came up with a good list, I don't know what you guys think.
3277400	3279080	All right, let's go to the phones.
3279080	3282040	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
3282040	3283040	Ravenstaufen.
3283040	3286760	Oh, surprise, surprise, how did you get through Ravenstaufen?
3286760	3288200	My new Mac, that's why.
3288200	3289800	Do you have us on speed dial?
3289800	3290800	Yes.
3290800	3292720	All right, well it worked.
3292720	3294280	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
3294280	3300320	Well, the E3's coming up and I know everyone's really excited and the thing about it is it's
3300320	3301320	very small.
3301320	3305880	Does it feel weird to you that it's now instead of it was in May?
3305880	3310240	To me, it was around my birthday and I was like, yeah, E3's coming up and I'm like, now
3310240	3313080	it's like E3's up?
3313080	3316160	Well yeah, but at the same time as we were kind of saying in part A, just because it's
3316160	3319840	a smaller show doesn't mean the companies have any less or more to gain and there's
3319840	3325640	going to be press there that's just as, you know, as honest as there were in years past.
3325640	3328800	I think enough people have managed to get in even though it's supposed to be a lockdown
3328800	3330000	show or whatever.
3330000	3334720	So I don't really see what's exactly changed except for the fact that, you know, little
3334720	3341280	podcasters like us and little press and foreign press and GameStop employees don't get in
3341280	3343680	and Best Buy employees and all that crap.
3343680	3345240	Yeah, I guess you're right.
3345240	3349240	You know, we're still going to get the press conferences like we normally do.
3349240	3354000	So I don't see much of a change like you said, you know, we're still going to see it.
3354000	3355680	Yeah, I don't know.
3355680	3358960	I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens as E3 goes on.
3358960	3363640	It's going to be hard to say, you know, and it's, and you could say that, you know, people,
3363640	3367160	there's not as many people to tear apart the demos or base their opinion of games right
3367160	3371760	off the demos, but you're seeing the whole Xbox Live and PlayStation 3 become more and
3371760	3373080	more and more.
3373080	3374080	You know what I mean?
3374080	3378840	Like you can download those on their own live or PlayStation Network services so you can
3378840	3381200	get a lot of those demos actually.
3381200	3384400	I'm really excited for actually bringing it home.
3384400	3388160	And that's going to be really interesting because they did an okay job with it last
3388160	3389160	year.
3389160	3393160	But for the people like me saying home, I lost planets on Xbox Live.
3393160	3398440	I was at E3 last year and I still enjoyed the Xbox Live, you know, watching their videos
3398440	3401520	from the show floor because I kind of actually liked seeing some of the boosts I went to
3401520	3402840	at E3 was kind of fun.
3402840	3403840	So I don't know.
3403840	3405160	Maybe I'm just weird like that.
3405160	3406880	Yeah, I'll be home too.
3406880	3408400	But Scott got that thing on his head.
3408400	3410280	Yeah, I heard about that over at Allgame.
3410280	3411480	What the hell is that?
3411480	3414040	He got he bought a webcam for his head.
3414040	3415100	He's going to E3.
3415100	3420720	See with stuff like that, you're not going to keep people out of E3.
3420720	3423720	Where there is information, there will be people seeking it out.
3423720	3425040	One more thing, Ravenstauven?
3425040	3426640	Yeah, one more thing.
3426640	3430440	You know, I just bought this Mac and no, I'm not using games because there's no such thing
3430440	3432920	as games on a Mac.
3432920	3435700	So what did you buy the Mac for, angry one?
3435700	3437040	I bought it because of change.
3437040	3438840	And no, Loki, don't tell me.
3438840	3440640	Don't pick up that pitchfork.
3440640	3441640	He'll be OK.
3441640	3442640	No, no, no.
3442640	3443640	I'm not switching.
3443640	3444640	No.
3444640	3445640	All right.
3445640	3446640	All right.
3446640	3447640	Thanks for the call, Ravenstauven.
3447640	3448640	Take care, buddy.
3448640	3449640	You too.
3449640	3450640	Bye.
3450640	3451640	Bye bye.
3451640	3452640	All right.
3452640	3456960	By the way, Maury, our emailer of the week, sent me a private message in chat.
3456960	3460080	Maury says, just for clarification, I'm in public school.
3460080	3464840	Ah, well then, wherever you are, congrats to your public school system.
3464840	3469080	And your English teacher's mad props for me.
3469080	3471020	And mad props to you for paying attention.
3471020	3473460	I want to show you this on air real quick because there's not a lot of calls coming
3473460	3474460	in right now.
3474460	3475460	So we want more calls.
3475460	3476460	But look at this.
3476460	3477460	Somebody just sent me the link for this in chat.
3477460	3479520	This is actually what they're doing at E3.
3479520	3482040	And you can see that Scott is on.
3482040	3483040	I can see your arm.
3483040	3484040	I'm sorry.
3484040	3487360	You can see Scott is on live right now playing Texas Hold'em.
3487360	3491040	Although I think he must have it hooked into his TV or something.
3491040	3495760	He's filing a complaint against somebody right now on Xbox Live.
3495760	3497320	Isn't that weird?
3497320	3499320	That's pretty cool.
3499320	3501440	It's like reality TV gone crazy.
3501440	3504320	SSJ100Matt says link or I shut the fuck up.
3504320	3509320	My god, I'd love to do this with my cat while I'm, you know, waiting for the day.
3509320	3512800	Normally at work, you know, the cat stays in the bedroom.
3512800	3516360	I should put a camera up on the wall or something.
3516360	3519520	I tried to say hi from OLR in the chat room, but it wouldn't let me because I didn't have
3519520	3520520	a nickname.
3520520	3521520	Forget it.
3521520	3524600	Somebody else, if you're watching that whole thing, tell them we just played that live
3524600	3525600	on air.
3525600	3526600	All right.
3526600	3527600	Let's go take some more calls.
3527600	3528600	Hello.
3528600	3529840	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
3529840	3530840	Who's this?
3530840	3531840	It's Legend of Zaku.
3531840	3532840	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
3532840	3534840	What's on your mind?
3534840	3537240	Nah, just trying to get through.
3537240	3538240	That's all.
3538240	3539240	Yeah.
3539240	3540240	I just came back from anime next.
3540240	3542040	How was anime next?
3542040	3543040	It was all right, though.
3543040	3548920	I mean, I know I was rooming with Ramen, so it was even better.
3548920	3549920	Yeah.
3549920	3555080	Since I think he's not here right now, he's supposed to be calling you to give you the
3555080	3556080	scoop on everything else.
3556080	3557080	Actually, wait.
3557080	3558080	Hold on.
3558080	3559080	Hold on.
3559080	3560080	Hello?
3560080	3561080	Hey, what's up?
3561080	3563760	Oh, I put Zaku on hold because I saw you calling in on the back line.
3563760	3564760	Can I conference?
3564760	3565760	How do I conference?
3565760	3566760	Shit.
3566760	3567760	Shut up, Ram.
3567760	3568760	Hold on.
3568760	3569760	Let me see.
3569760	3570760	This might put you on hold.
3570760	3571760	Cool.
3571760	3573760	Zaku, you still there?
3573760	3574760	Yeah.
3574760	3575760	Okay.
3575760	3576760	Ramen's actually on the other line.
3576760	3577760	We just had to put him on hold.
3577760	3578760	God damn it.
3578760	3579760	How do we conference?
3579760	3580760	Oh, wait.
3580760	3582320	There's a button that says conference.
3582320	3587360	Showing current call to another call.
3587360	3589520	This is live radio, boys and girls.
3589520	3590520	Okay.
3590520	3591520	Hello?
3591520	3592520	Yeah.
3592520	3593520	No.
3593520	3595360	I'm conferencing with you.
3595360	3596360	Hold on.
3596360	3597360	We're going to call you right back.
3597360	3598360	All right.
3598360	3599360	Live radio, boys and girls.
3599360	3600360	Hi.
3600360	3602360	You still there, Ramen?
3602360	3603360	Hello?
3603360	3607160	I fucked it all up.
3607160	3608160	Ramen!
3608160	3609160	Ramen!
3609160	3610160	Ramen!
3610160	3611160	Ramen!
3611160	3612160	Ramen!
3612160	3620000	Now I just lost our entire anime next report.
3620000	3622000	Let's just call Zaku back.
3622000	3623000	Hi.
3623000	3624840	All right.
3624840	3625840	It didn't work.
3625840	3626840	So whatever.
3626840	3628520	Just give us your report and then we'll hold Ramen calls back.
3628520	3629520	What's on your mind?
3629520	3630520	Yeah.
3630520	3635640	Basically, between an agreement between me and him, I'm covering the gaming aspect of
3635640	3636640	it.
3636640	3638600	So far, their gaming room.
3638600	3643480	I mean, it has the usual stuff, Halo, Dirt Strike.
3643480	3650720	They added stuff like Guitar Hero and the inevitable 2DX setup, which was mediocre at
3650720	3651720	best.
3651720	3652720	Yeah, but that's about it.
3652720	3657400	They had tournaments on certain games, like Smash Brothers.
3657400	3661120	Was there any new stuff in the game room, stuff you hadn't seen before?
3661120	3665720	Only the Guitar Hero, from what I heard, since they replaced the DDR setup with that.
3665720	3668640	They used the 360 version.
3668640	3669640	Oh, interesting.
3669640	3670640	Okay.
3670640	3674840	And so they held tournaments on that and Gears of War.
3674840	3681200	But besides that, they were also selling a lot of imports in the dealer's room within
3681200	3682200	the convention hall.
3682200	3685680	So I managed to snag a copy of Fifth Style for like 40 bucks.
3685680	3686680	Very cool.
3686680	3691760	What about any gaming paraphernalia, for lack of a better word, like this ball-fire figure
3691760	3693160	came from something like that?
3693160	3695200	Yeah, they were all in the dealer room.
3695200	3699400	There was a lot of cosplayers, you know, dressing up as Mario and other video game characters.
3699400	3701600	But yeah, most of the good merchandise.
3701600	3704760	I bet you didn't see someone dressed up as a Wii remote.
3704760	3707400	Oh, actually, close.
3707400	3711080	An actual Wii, with the other person holding the Wii mode behind them.
3711080	3713440	Jonas, I think someone stole your idea.
3713440	3717680	So wait, they cosplayed as an actual Wii system without the Wii remote?
3717680	3718680	Yes.
3718680	3723040	No, an actual Wii system, and then this other person was holding the Wii mode for him.
3723040	3728000	I heard rumors that that showed up in SAC Anime in January.
3728000	3731800	If that is the case, I might see him on SAC Anime in July.
3731800	3732800	Which is quite exciting.
3732800	3734480	You're talking about an East Coast thing.
3734480	3735480	I don't know.
3735480	3739280	Who the hell would come to SAC for an anime convention if you don't live here, or the
3739280	3740280	Bay Area, maybe.
3740280	3743360	Yeah, you're talking about something that happened in Jersey, not Sacramento.
3743360	3745640	All right, well, all right, look.
3745640	3747480	Now stop the whole bi-coastal thing.
3747480	3751280	Zaku, anything else you want to share on the game room?
3751280	3755880	That's pretty much about it.
3755880	3760120	The only thing I can say that really pissed me off was just the fact that it was too small
3760120	3762640	and they were just controlling crowds.
3762640	3763640	Basically it had a forum.
3763640	3767120	It was basically almost like a night club where they just had people just waiting there
3767120	3773440	in line, you know, since the game room was packed most of the time anyways.
3773440	3774440	So yeah.
3774440	3780320	All right, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can go to Rama and get his
3780320	3782200	side of the story on what's going on.
3782200	3784560	Anything else you want to say about the con real quick?
3784560	3785560	It was all right.
3785560	3788880	I mean, it's my first con, so I really don't have that much to say.
3788880	3793120	All I need to know is that I need to go to more conventions.
3793120	3794760	But you want to go to more cons now?
3794760	3797440	Yeah, I guess I got a plan for next year.
3797440	3798440	Oh, it's a con.
3798440	3799440	Well, I guess that's a good sign.
3799440	3800440	All right, who knows?
3800440	3801440	I may come in.
3801440	3803720	I should have planned earlier.
3803720	3807120	I'm hoping next year I'll be able to afford an East Coast con, so we'll see.
3807120	3808120	All right.
3808120	3809120	All right, later, Zaku.
3809120	3810120	All right, later.
3810120	3815200	And of course, now that I'm finished with Zaku, Rama is nowhere to be seen.
3815200	3816360	I should be able to call him back, though.
3816360	3819800	He's somewhere in the history, right?
3819800	3821120	Damn it.
3821120	3822940	Live radio, boys and girls.
3822940	3824320	I guess not.
3824320	3825560	We'll take another call real quick.
3825560	3827400	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3827400	3828400	Who's this?
3828400	3829400	Hey, guys.
3829400	3830400	This is Footy Monster from Argentina.
3830400	3831760	Hey, Footy Monster.
3831760	3832760	What's on your mind?
3832760	3835560	We're waiting for Rama to call back, but he never did, so we're taking another call in
3835560	3836560	the meantime.
3836560	3837560	So what's on your mind?
3837560	3839320	All right, then I'll make it fat just in case he calls back.
3839320	3840320	It's all good.
3840320	3841320	Take your time.
3841320	3842320	I'll let you know if we see him.
3842320	3843640	All right, then.
3843640	3845800	Just two things I wanted to point out.
3845800	3850740	One thing is that, well, picked up, quote unquote, kind of illegally, Nervous Breakdown
3850740	3855500	for DS, which is an Arkanoid Breakout clone.
3855500	3856500	That sounds like fun.
3856500	3860400	And it is really good.
3860400	3864440	It's a game you wouldn't pay two cents for, but it's actually really, really good.
3864440	3869920	It starts off as a normal Breakout game, but really quick, it begins to have different
3869920	3873160	skins and different gimmicks to the game.
3873160	3877060	Instead of having one paddle, you have one on the bottom screen and one on the top screen,
3877060	3881480	and you've got to make sure that you don't flumb with the ball in the middle.
3881480	3884800	You might have a ball that starts going faster and faster, which is second, or you might
3884800	3889080	need to blow into the screen to have the ball go up a little bit all the time instead of
3889080	3893160	keep going down, because sometimes you're on a scrolling screen, and you're always going
3893160	3894160	up.
3894160	3895360	It's like you die and stuff like that.
3895360	3897120	It's really weird, but it's actually pretty fun.
3897120	3899440	How do you control that with the stylus?
3899440	3900440	All with the stylus.
3900440	3902440	There's no buttons whatsoever.
3902440	3904400	Do you drag the paddle around?
3904400	3906560	Yeah, you drag the paddle around.
3906560	3908480	Sometimes you've got to drag just left and right.
3908480	3912040	Sometimes you can drag across the whole screen, so you can actually move it up and down, too.
3912040	3916040	And there's this level where you actually have to draw your own paddle, so you can draw
3916040	3917560	it in any shape you want.
3917560	3919880	That sounds pretty cool.
3919880	3920880	I know.
3920880	3924680	There's a team of 10 people that made it, and it's like 20 bucks or something like that,
3924680	3929840	so I'm definitely going to try to pick it up next week when I go to Toronto.
3929840	3933720	But yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know, I know there are some people that like that
3933720	3939400	kind of game on All Art, and maybe you, Sky, because you like puzzle games, but that's
3939400	3941920	a pretty good game, so you might want to try it out.
3941920	3942920	Absolutely.
3942920	3946040	I want this game, because I was a big Arkanoid fan.
3946040	3951000	Actually, there's a little part where you're basically controlling a ship instead of having
3951000	3952000	just a paddle.
3952000	3956480	It's a ship that shoots lasers, so you can actually shoot lasers and destroy obstacles
3956480	3959880	on the screen and stuff like that while you're bouncing the ball around.
3959880	3961880	Do you get to fight dough?
3961880	3963760	What was that, sorry?
3963760	3965360	Do you get to fight dough?
3965360	3966360	Yeah.
3966360	3968700	All right.
3968700	3972320	Real quickly, before I let you go, anything you're looking forward to at E3 this week?
3972320	3973320	Yeah.
3973320	3978080	Actually, I'm looking forward to everything RPG-related for obvious reasons, and I'm really
3978080	3982240	curious to see if Sega is going to announce anything related to Shenmue, like at all,
3982240	3983880	even Shenmue Online, anything.
3983880	3987680	But it's just hopeful to me that I know it will not happen, but I have to keep wondering
3987680	3992520	about it, because they robbed me from my Shenmue 3, so hey, you know.
3992520	3997380	I would say you have about as much chance of seeing Shenmue 3 as you do the public apology
3997380	3998380	for Sonic.
3998380	4001320	Yeah, Shenmue 2 sort of bombed, didn't it?
4001320	4006680	The first one was really good, especially playing Space Harrier.
4006680	4008680	That was my first Shenmue.
4008680	4011580	We probably shouldn't be getting to this, because I'm such a big fanboy that I could
4011580	4015360	talk for hours about the game, so just saying that.
4015360	4018600	One last thing, I think next weekend there's going to be a fighting game tournament in
4018600	4024960	Toronto in York University, so if you are interested, I think it's like five bucks or
4024960	4025960	ten bucks to get in.
4025960	4029920	It's like three days, and it's going to be crazy full of people, so I'm going to try
4029920	4033040	to, since I might fly, arrive on Saturday, I'm going to try to go straight there.
4033040	4035640	Well, give us a call and let us know how it goes.
4035640	4041040	If I actually want to do anything, I'll call in, you know, next Sunday.
4041040	4042040	Alright, sounds good.
4042040	4043360	Thanks so much for the call, Footy Monster.
4043360	4044360	Take care.
4044360	4045360	Okay, you guys too.
4045360	4046360	Alright, bye-bye.
4046360	4047360	Bye.
4047360	4049880	Alright, I think we have Rama calling back now.
4049880	4053040	Hi, you're on Orange Onions Radio, who's this?
4053040	4057200	Hello, you're on Orange Onions Radio, who's this?
4057200	4058200	It's Harvey.
4058200	4060580	Apparently the volume went away.
4060580	4062560	If you can hear me, we can't hear you.
4062560	4065160	Something happened to your phone.
4065160	4067880	That totally is Rama trying to call us back, too.
4067880	4069880	Son of a gun.
4069880	4072560	Ron, Ron.
4072560	4074560	I don't know what's wrong.
4074560	4077200	I wanted to hear the report, too, from a vet.
4077200	4078200	Oh my God.
4078200	4083440	SSG100, Matt, you're suddenly my hero for saying Admiral Ackbar's cereal is greater
4083440	4086700	than Night Trap 2.
4086700	4091840	We watched that, Rob, before you showed up at the 4th of July party.
4091840	4095400	We watched the Star Wars robot chicken.
4095400	4097160	I think you guys were watching some of that.
4097160	4100160	No, we were watching My Name is Earl when you were over.
4100160	4101540	That show was great.
4101540	4104800	You had a great 4th of July party, except for my killer headache, but that wasn't your
4104800	4105800	party's fault.
4105800	4106800	You want to know what, Rob?
4106800	4107800	What?
4107800	4110160	I had a headache the entire time myself, and I ended up having to sleep with an ice pack
4110160	4111160	on my head.
4111160	4113240	Oh, that's horrible.
4113240	4115320	I was in migraine hell the entire time.
4115320	4118080	The sad thing is that I live there, so I couldn't leave.
4118080	4123000	Thankfully, my boyfriend's really good friend is a physician's assistant, so we always call
4123000	4126360	him for drug advice, like, what should I be taking, because I have a killer headache,
4126360	4127360	and it worked.
4127360	4130120	All right, I don't see Rama calling back, so at least we'll go to another call.
4130120	4131120	Hi, you're on Orange Honors Radio.
4131120	4132120	Who's this?
4132120	4133120	Hey, Rob.
4133120	4137480	Able to think from the forum, so you can mute my thing.
4137480	4138480	Hello.
4138480	4141480	Able to think.
4141480	4142880	Are you a first-time caller?
4142880	4144560	Yeah, I am.
4144560	4145840	Well, welcome to the show.
4145840	4146840	What's on your mind?
4146840	4148640	Thanks for calling.
4148640	4159880	That psycho lady from Australia who decided to try to abduct, well, technically abduct
4159880	4162800	the kids from whatever state that was.
4162800	4164360	That was kind of gross.
4164360	4167080	Yeah, what is up with that?
4167080	4168400	What did you want to say about that?
4168400	4172820	I mean, does that just not make you feel good in your tummy?
4172820	4175000	Does it make you sick?
4175000	4178520	It makes me want to go grab a shotgun, and hopefully...
4178520	4183080	Well, now, wait a minute, careful what you say on an internet radio program.
4183080	4184480	You need to be shot with happy lasers.
4184480	4185480	Yes, that's right.
4185480	4188440	You want to shoot with flowers and rose petals.
4188440	4189440	Bunch of flowers.
4189440	4194320	Seriously, if a lady like that came to my door, I'd probably freak.
4194320	4199400	Well, but the thing that pisses me off about it is that it gives World of Warcraft a bad
4199400	4204480	name because nobody stops to think that, oh, this is just some crazy bitch.
4204480	4209120	But they go, oh, well, they met on World of Warcraft, so obviously all the crazies are
4209120	4212320	on World of Warcraft, which is somewhat true.
4212320	4216960	There are a lot of crazies on World of Warcraft, but we're not all crazy.
4216960	4218680	What's that, buddy?
4218680	4224440	I think you mean video games in general because that seems to be whatever everybody thinks.
4224440	4228660	Whenever anything goes wrong with society, it's all video games' fault.
4228660	4229660	That's true.
4229660	4230660	That happens.
4230660	4235480	And our crazy psycho lawyer friend whose name we must not mention.
4235480	4236480	That's absolutely right.
4236480	4237480	I know.
4237480	4238480	It's just, ugh.
4238480	4239480	Drives us nuts.
4239480	4242440	Well, what are you looking forward to at E3 next week?
4242440	4250160	Okay, I want to see if Nintendo announces a Wii hard drive.
4250160	4253280	A Wii hard drive?
4253280	4256400	What the hell would they use it for?
4256400	4261480	Virtual console games, and if they have an Xbox Live service coming on, then they're
4261480	4270520	going to need to get it so you can have more space or else you're not going to be able
4270520	4272720	to fit all your games on there.
4272720	4277200	How about they use the SD memory card slot that they have on there and don't seem to
4277200	4278200	use for anything?
4278200	4284000	Yeah, well, that would help too, but still, you have to go buy lots of SD cards, a hard
4284000	4287160	drive, or just be a single purchase.
4287160	4292560	I'm sure they'll use it for all that download content that's available on Wii Connect 24.
4292560	4298800	I know my flash drive is teaming with tons and tons and tons and tons of content, so
4298800	4302240	much so that I don't get around to playing any of it.
4302240	4303600	Well, I mean, who knows?
4303600	4308080	The Magic 8-Ball says not bloody likely on that, but who knew that Nintendo would put
4308080	4311880	out a two-screen system with a touchscreen?
4311880	4319280	Oh, and on two.
4319280	4320280	I have an FU.
4320280	4322160	Is that okay if I F you something?
4322160	4324160	Really quick, sure.
4324160	4327920	F you to spin markers because they cheat.
4327920	4329840	I can't spin my finger.
4329840	4333080	So you're giving an FU an oh and on two.
4333080	4335120	What's the problem with the spin markers?
4335120	4338280	Okay, they cheat.
4338280	4339280	It's like a nice lady.
4339280	4344320	She has to get their sweet spot or else it doesn't work.
4344320	4346200	Very well put, my friend.
4346200	4347200	Very well put.
4347200	4348200	All right, we've got to let you go, though, buddy.
4348200	4351560	Thanks so much for the call, but we're going to try and get Rama one more time here, and
4351560	4354320	we'll talk to you again, okay?
4354320	4355320	See you.
4355320	4356920	All right, thanks for the call.
4356920	4357920	We like hearing from noobs.
4357920	4360000	It's always good to hear from new people.
4360000	4361000	Ah, damn it.
4361000	4363600	Just as I went to the tab that Rama's call, he dropped.
4363600	4364600	Ah.
4364600	4365840	Oh, there he is again.
4365840	4367560	Let's try to get him.
4367560	4368560	One more time.
4368560	4369560	This is Rama.
4369560	4370560	Who's this?
4370560	4371560	This is Rama.
4371560	4372560	Can you hear me now?
4372560	4373560	Thank God.
4373560	4374560	Yes, we can.
4374560	4375560	We can hear you.
4375560	4376560	What's on your mind, buddy?
4376560	4377560	Please.
4377560	4378560	This better be good.
4378560	4383280	All right, now I'm going with my anime mixed con report, and I'll tell you this right now.
4383280	4387240	For a local con, it was pretty much off the walls.
4387240	4388240	Really?
4388240	4389240	That's a glowing reveal.
4389240	4390240	What happened?
4390240	4391240	What made this con so freaking great?
4391240	4396480	Well, one of the main important things about cons is it's just as good as the friends who
4396480	4397480	were there.
4397480	4403240	When I got there, I knew half the people there getting stuff like, hey, how are you and stuff.
4403240	4408400	The fact that it's like the way that the con is laid out, you have the expo center, like
4408400	4412800	six, seven hotels in the area, everybody's just hanging out at the holly in Fort Lorne
4412800	4417400	or they're hanging out from the expo center, and you go on the inside, you see a lot of
4417400	4420960	video game cosplay, which was really awesome in my book.
4420960	4423560	Was there a lot of gaming content at this con?
4423560	4428000	The way Zachar made it sound, it wasn't too much on the gaming.
4428000	4432840	Well I do know this much, it basically got rid of the DDR room and replaced it with Guitar
4432840	4433840	Hero.
4433840	4438280	Yeah, I guess you've kind of seen that slowly happening in a lot of cons, and pretty soon
4438280	4440640	Rock Band, huh?
4440640	4441640	Pretty much.
4441640	4445400	I would like it as if what anime had choose to have was they actually had an arcade machine
4445400	4447800	in the con itself.
4447800	4450520	People come up and play it for free, which I thought was pretty cool.
4450520	4454640	Hey, Rama, the chat wants to know, are you calling in from a TARDIS?
4454640	4460800	No, it's called Sprint Network.
4460800	4464600	You just sound like you're in a box somewhere, it's kind of funny, that's alright.
4464600	4467360	Well, Rama, how about the anime side of things?
4467360	4470200	I know you're a big anime fan, how was that represented?
4470200	4473200	Was there a lot of stuff to do and see and good guests and stuff?
4473200	4474200	Definitely.
4474200	4479640	I was able to interview a couple of voice actors, Chris Patton and Monica Rial.
4479640	4483280	They both worked for ABB and Funimation.
4483280	4487680	One thing I've noticed with a lot of cons nowadays, it's not about what's going on now,
4487680	4490000	but what's very popular in Japan.
4490000	4494800	And the biggest thing is always Final Fantasy, which is a gig, but that's starting to kind
4494800	4496280	of dwindle down.
4496280	4501880	Now you see a lot of more stuff that's coming out, I saw a lot of Lucky Star, Cosplay, I
4501880	4506280	think some SMA would be still somewhat popular.
4506280	4507280	Interesting, huh?
4507280	4508280	Very cool.
4508280	4509280	Very.
4509280	4510280	Anything else?
4510280	4514280	Any funny, funny things happen to the con you want to share with us, especially funny
4514280	4515280	moments?
4515280	4523520	Well, I was at the dead dog, which is the staff party, and the Las Vegas rule was put
4523520	4524520	in effect.
4524520	4529960	So I really can't tell you about that, but I can say this, most of my funny experiences
4529960	4533960	is that running into people that I know, and I'm like, do I know you?
4533960	4539240	Oh, now I know who you are, different costume, different makeup, and it's like, ah, I see.
4539240	4543440	Well, what happens at Anime Cons stays at Anime Cons, huh?
4543440	4547560	Definitely, especially when you're taking shots with Silco.
4547560	4551840	Well, all right, don't have too much fun over there, okay?
4551840	4555360	I don't want to be left, I was on my way back when I was trying to call.
4555360	4556360	What?
4556360	4557680	I'm sorry?
4557680	4560840	I was on my way back from the party when I was trying to call.
4560840	4563560	Ah, well, maybe that explains some of the difficulty we had earlier.
4563560	4566240	All right, Rama, we're going to let you go so we wrap up the show, but thanks so much
4566240	4568240	for calling and giving us your report, okay?
4568240	4569240	No problem.
4569240	4570240	Thank you.
4570240	4571240	All right, later.
4571240	4574920	He really does sound like he was calling in from inside a cardboard box.
4574920	4578360	We can do one more call here real quick, and then we're going to call it a night.
4578360	4579600	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
4579600	4580600	Who's this?
4580600	4581600	Hello?
4581600	4583600	Hi, who's this?
4583600	4585160	You're on Orange Lawn Radio.
4585160	4587160	This is Sinan from Finland.
4587160	4588560	Oh, wow.
4588560	4590520	We love getting listeners from far away.
4590520	4594040	What's on your mind, my Finnish friend?
4594040	4599440	I don't really have all that much in mind, I think, because it's early in the morning
4599440	4600440	over here.
4600440	4601440	I know.
4601440	4603000	You've been staying up very late to listen to us live.
4603000	4604360	We appreciate it.
4604360	4610240	Well, I was off to work at the beginning, but I've been here one hour now, I think.
4610240	4612240	Oh, very cool.
4612240	4615320	Has there been a topic tonight that you wanted to chime in on?
4615320	4616320	Something that...
4616320	4617320	No.
4617320	4618320	Not really.
4618320	4622000	While at work, I listen to the five...
4622000	4623920	What the fuck is this sound I'm hearing?
4623920	4626960	It's Rob being silly.
4626960	4628480	I think you're hearing us echoing.
4628480	4629480	It's okay.
4629480	4636000	All right, I don't think we've had someone call in just to say, hey.
4636000	4642480	It's really because I listen to the five-year anniversary show, and I thought I would just
4642480	4643480	drop in a line.
4643480	4648320	After all, I got back from work, and I thought that maybe I could call in now and never again
4648320	4651000	listen live.
4651000	4654120	Did you enjoy the five-year anniversary show?
4654120	4655120	Yeah, I did.
4655120	4660480	I've been listening to this show for about one year now, but this is the first time I'm
4660480	4662560	listening live, so I thought I would call in.
4662560	4663560	All right.
4663560	4666640	Well, welcome to the live experience, and thanks for letting us know that there's folks
4666640	4668680	all around the world that listen to us.
4668680	4671320	Hey, is E3 big news over there as well?
4671320	4674240	Are you guys looking forward to the big E3 show here in the States?
4674240	4675880	Yeah, of course.
4675880	4678800	It's always, except for now, isn't it smaller nowadays?
4678800	4679800	Well, a little bit.
4679800	4681680	I mean, but it's still all the same news.
4681680	4686160	The show itself might be small, but the news, I believe, is still going to stay the same.
4686160	4690320	Is there anything that you hope will happen at this year's E3?
4690320	4694520	I hope there will be some good information about Fallout 3, because that's a game I'm
4694520	4695520	very interested in.
4695520	4697120	Ah, Fallout 3.
4697120	4698920	What is it about Fallout 3?
4698920	4702320	Were you a fan of the first two games, or have you just seen the screenshots?
4702320	4703320	Are you excited?
4703320	4705420	What is it about Fallout that you love?
4705420	4709600	I'm a huge Fallout fan, which means that Fallout 3 I'm pretty scared about, I think, is going
4709600	4710600	to be shit.
4710600	4713960	Why do you think that Fallout 3 is going to be shit?
4713960	4718960	It's going to be Oblivion with guns.
4718960	4719960	Oblivion with guns.
4719960	4721840	But Oblivion is a freaking great game.
4721840	4724920	But I guess, you know, maybe that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to translate well
4724920	4726440	into a series like Fallout.
4726440	4728440	No, I don't think so.
4728440	4730720	And I don't really like Oblivion either.
4730720	4731720	You don't like Oblivion?
4731720	4732960	No, of course not.
4732960	4734800	What were you playing it on?
4734800	4735800	What system?
4735800	4737440	Oh, I haven't been playing it.
4737440	4740840	That's why I don't like it.
4740840	4746200	I'm sorry, I'm thinking of a different game.
4746200	4747200	It's alright.
4747200	4748840	It's getting late over here, too.
4748840	4753680	Alright, well, anything else you wanted to share with us quickly tonight before we let
4753680	4757560	you go?
4757560	4758560	Not really, I don't think so.
4758560	4761840	Alright, well, that's alright, thanks so much for calling, it was certainly an entertaining
4761840	4763480	call, we appreciate it, okay?
4763480	4764480	I hope so.
4764480	4765480	Alright.
4765480	4767480	Let's watch some other shows and look at our time.
4767480	4768480	Alright, sounds good.
4768480	4772400	And we know you have to stay up late to listen live, so we appreciate that true fandom over
4772400	4774920	there overseas, on the other side of the pond.
4774920	4776480	Yeah, two ponds.
4776480	4778280	Alright, oh yeah, that's right.
4778280	4781800	It was just a hop, skip, and a jump, and an 18 hour flight, right?
4781800	4783800	Alright, take care, buddy.
4783800	4784800	Yep, take care.
4784800	4785800	Later.
4785800	4786800	Bye.
4786800	4787800	Later.
4787800	4789680	That's great.
4789680	4792680	Not only was he, you know, he was from another country, which was kind of cool, but he just
4792680	4794840	kind of called to say, hey, what's up?
4794840	4795840	That was cool.
4795840	4796840	What's up?
4796840	4797840	How's it going?
4797840	4801240	That was rad.
4801240	4804120	That was a very fitting call for tonight, I think.
4804120	4805120	That really were.
4805120	4808740	Alright, unfortunately, I know there's still folks trying to call in, but we got to wrap
4808740	4814680	it up and get the show done and move on to our, you know, very uninteresting lives.
4814680	4817960	So we're going to now ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio.
4817960	4819960	I think I have a few things.
4819960	4821800	Well, yes, sir.
4821800	4822800	Uh oh.
4822800	4827560	There's rumors going around that Rock Band may be an Xbox 360 timed exclusive game.
4827560	4834920	The reason being is because the invitation to their Rock Band E3 presentation had the
4834920	4841160	Xbox 360 logo on there, but amazingly enough, the PlayStation logo was not on there.
4841160	4842600	Could it be a mistake?
4842600	4843600	I don't know.
4843600	4848940	Although I know from all the videos that we've seen from, I think, the EA event, the game
4848940	4855280	was being played on an Xbox 360 dev kit, not a PlayStation 3, so we'll find out pretty
4855280	4858200	soon, I'm hoping.
4858200	4862840	Other games possibly going to be delayed, Stuntman Ignition, the PlayStation 3 version
4862840	4867040	is going to be delayed for that, apparently.
4867040	4871760	Most likely going to slide from August to October this year.
4871760	4873800	So that's kind of interesting.
4873800	4880520	A game called Atari Classics has been spotted for the PSP on Gamefly.
4880520	4885580	In the past, we've noticed that, of course, Gamefly has a lot of titles of stuff that
4885580	4892680	have leaked, like beautiful Katamari before people notice or before they have the official
4892680	4896300	announcement.
4896300	4898380	Let's see what else here.
4898380	4904000	There's a rumor also going around that Mario Kart Wii may be coming out this year, but
4904000	4905000	in Europe.
4905000	4914440	The rumor is that the US will be getting Smash Bros. Brawl in 2007 and Mario Kart in 2008,
4914440	4919680	whereas Europe will be getting the opposite, Mario Kart in 2007 and Smash Bros. in 2008.
4919680	4922600	What is this, Nintendo's apology to Europe by screwing us over?
4922600	4923600	I want fucking Mario Kart.
4923600	4924800	Fuck this Smash Bros. shit.
4924800	4926680	You can all wait for Smash Bros.
4926680	4928760	I want my cake and I'm going to eat it too.
4928760	4929760	I want those things.
4929760	4933400	I want more Mario Kart.
4933400	4940360	The other one that's interesting is Battalion Wars 2 has been pushed back to October 29th
4940360	4943040	and that I know is official.
4943040	4948280	What makes that interesting though is there's no Wii game coming out in September.
4948280	4953560	So if you think about it, and this is all speculation, but if you think about it and
4953560	4958640	they wanted a pretty strong Wii title to compete against Halo 3 and whatnot, that would be
4958640	4988040	the perfect prime spot for Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
4988640	4993200	Well, I understand you guys wanted to go to E3, I mean, there's always next year.
4993200	4994320	That's right.
4994320	4995320	Some other year.
4995320	4999800	That's okay, we're having fun stomping and throwing a fit this year, it's fine.
4999800	5003360	By the way, was it FU's of the week earlier today?
5003360	5004360	Missed them.
5004360	5006080	They were early in the show, sorry to say.
5006080	5007080	I'm not angsty, so.
5007080	5009960	Oh, I was going to say you could quickly throw one out as your final thought.
5009960	5017880	Well, the only FU I had was Anime Expo, 07's organization this year, being an unorganized
5017880	5023920	and having the staff pro-screw it all over for everybody else, especially with the scheduling.
5023920	5026200	I have not been hearing good things about what went down there.
5026200	5030760	And of course, everyone heard about the whole petition of trying to move Anime Expo 08 out
5030760	5032760	of Los Angeles Convention Center.
5032760	5033760	Wow.
5033760	5040940	Yes, there's been an extreme amount of debates over it, being held unsafe, and how the hotels
5040940	5045880	are like two blocks away from the M. I say move it back to Disneyland.
5045880	5046880	They love that.
5046880	5047880	Oh, yeah.
5047880	5048880	Oh, hell no.
5048880	5049880	That was a nightmare.
5049880	5050880	All right.
5050880	5051880	Anyway, thank you very much, Jost.
5051880	5054560	DarkSakura, your final thought?
5054560	5058120	I'm going to Disneyland, bitches.
5058120	5063960	My final thought is I want candy very badly, even though I shouldn't be eating more candy,
5063960	5064960	but I really want candy.
5064960	5065960	Oh, yeah.
5065960	5067280	Don't forget about SacAnime this week.
5067280	5068280	I won't.
5068280	5069280	I won't.
5069280	5070280	Loki, your final thought?
5070280	5072720	Last but certainly not least, Loki.
5072720	5076800	I have a kitty named after an Atari emulator.
5076800	5078240	I didn't name the cat.
5078240	5080840	Some old woman named the cat.
