Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream

00:04.760 --> 00:05.760
twice weekly.

00:05.760 --> 00:12.240
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links

00:12.240 --> 00:15.480

00:15.480 --> 00:19.960
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.800
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday evening.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.800
It is July the 8th of 2007 and of course Orange Lounge Radio tapes live on Sunday nights and

00:27.800 --> 00:32.920
releases our show in two parts to our RSS feed twice weekly and about the time you're

00:32.920 --> 00:38.160
getting this right now, E3 is going on and of course as we talked about in part A, one

00:38.160 --> 00:43.600
of the things that Sony is most likely going to be announcing at E3 is a $100 price drop

00:43.600 --> 00:44.960
for the PlayStation 3.

00:44.960 --> 00:49.760
However, as we do record the show live on Sunday nights, sometimes things change as

00:49.760 --> 00:51.080
the show is going on.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
Yes, Loki?

00:52.080 --> 00:54.200
Yes, it's not a secret anymore.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.740
It is official.

00:55.740 --> 00:59.960
They have announced that the PlayStation 3 will be dropping or I should say the PlayStation

00:59.960 --> 01:06.560
360 system will be dropping to $499 actually this week.

01:06.560 --> 01:10.640
The other announcement though is coming in August, they're going to be releasing the

01:10.640 --> 01:15.920
80 gig model that's going to be also bundled with a retail copy of Motorstorm.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.000
That is going to be at the $599 price point.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.520
So everybody loves that $599 price point but at least it's nice to see that they're bundling

01:24.520 --> 01:27.320
a game in there as well.

01:27.320 --> 01:32.480
I don't know, a little bit more for your money but still not a whole lot.

01:32.480 --> 01:37.680
But that's probably going to be announced again at E3 and during Sony's so-called

01:37.680 --> 01:42.780
press conference but just thought we'd like to let you guys know about that.

01:42.780 --> 01:48.080
Now onto other things, of course with E3 right around the corner, one thing that we loved

01:48.080 --> 01:51.880
last year and they're doing it again is Microsoft is going to be doing that bringing

01:51.880 --> 01:59.380
it home thing where they actually have videos and demos from the show floor almost.

01:59.380 --> 02:06.960
Last year we got to play Test Drive Unlimited and MotoGP 2006 and there was one other one

02:06.960 --> 02:09.440
in there, I don't know, fun stuff.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.200
So this year though, who knows what we're going to get but we're going to get more

02:13.200 --> 02:19.700
of that, more demos, more game trailers and stuff like that, more free themes hopefully

02:19.700 --> 02:23.880
and also they're not the only ones doing that.

02:23.880 --> 02:28.640
This year Sony is jumping on the bandwagon, so they say, and are going to be doing something

02:28.640 --> 02:31.720
very similar on the PlayStation Network as well, you're going to have downloadable

02:31.720 --> 02:35.160
demos and videos and whatnot.

02:35.160 --> 02:41.240
So awesome, I can't wait to download new demos because I like playing demos.

02:41.240 --> 02:45.320
Do you think, just indulge me here as silly as this thought might be, do you think that

02:45.320 --> 02:50.420
Microsoft might pull out a price drop of their own?

02:50.420 --> 02:51.760
Possibly.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.560
They're not going to just be like, whatever.

02:54.560 --> 03:00.080
I don't think they need to but now that Sony dropped their price, they might pull

03:00.080 --> 03:05.940
that thing where we think that our price point, even though it's $399, is so competitive

03:05.940 --> 03:09.240
with their price point but they might be going by the elites, still even though their elites

03:09.240 --> 03:12.320
are $20 less supposedly.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.360
Do you think they might throw in a free game or something to make them feel more lucrative?

03:15.360 --> 03:21.080
They may throw in a free game, like maybe Halo, Forza, Halo, something like that.

03:21.080 --> 03:25.400
I don't know if they'll do Halo but probably Forza or something but there may be a game

03:25.400 --> 03:29.320
pack-in, there may be also a price drop.

03:29.320 --> 03:34.640
I hope that they do a price drop, it might be pretty cool but I don't know.

03:34.640 --> 03:40.560
Not guaranteeing anything but I think if they did, it would definitely help.

03:40.560 --> 03:46.640
SSJ100Matt says, not until after Halo 3 comes out, would there be another price drop?

03:46.640 --> 03:53.120
They very well might hold it off until after Halo comes out and just say, boom, here you

03:53.120 --> 03:58.320
go, price drop, let's sell some systems.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.600
Let's talk about real quickly another game that a lot of folks are anticipating that's

04:01.600 --> 04:04.000
going to be getting a demo of its own, it's Blue Dragon.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.640
Of course, a lot of folks are very excited about this because it's not very often you

04:07.640 --> 04:12.760
get a Japanese-style RPG on an Xbox system but we're finally starting to see some this

04:12.760 --> 04:15.960
year thanks to Eternal Sonata and of course Blue Dragon.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.240
Eternal Sonata had a demo come out already but Blue Dragon will be getting a demo on

04:19.240 --> 04:23.240
Xbox Live Marketplace July 20th.

04:23.240 --> 04:28.920
There is a Dengeki online magazine in Japan that is claiming that a 1.1 gigabyte demo

04:28.920 --> 04:32.200
is going to be coming out over here in the US on July 20th.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.680
It's going to be a two-hour demo if this story is correct.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.720
It's going to be a pretty intense demo.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.080
It's only going to be available though for two weeks.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.440
The demo will disappear on August 3rd.

04:43.440 --> 04:48.360
So now it almost sounds like it's a beta test or something even though it's not an online

04:48.360 --> 04:49.360
game.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.360
So I don't know what the hell else to call it.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.360
It's a limited-time demo.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.360
Kind of interesting.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.480
It's just an incentive for you to play it, I guess.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.040
But a two-hour demo?

04:58.040 --> 04:59.040
Really?

04:59.040 --> 05:00.040
That's pretty cool.

05:00.040 --> 05:03.400
That sounds like a really good idea, especially if the game is going to be a bunch longer

05:03.400 --> 05:04.400
than that.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.320
I think they're trying to give a percentage of the game to get an idea of it.

05:08.320 --> 05:12.520
It is supposed to be one of the first Xbox 360 games that's on two disks.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
Interesting.

05:13.520 --> 05:19.720
And then I also think about your typical Xbox early adopter is not someone who's typically

05:19.720 --> 05:25.240
into these type of Japanese RPGs because a lot of folks who have not picked up an Xbox

05:25.240 --> 05:29.440
360 still, they do like these games and aren't impressed with the fact that Microsoft doesn't

05:29.440 --> 05:30.440
have them out.

05:30.440 --> 05:34.960
So maybe having a very long two-hour demo is kind of a way to show these folks who maybe

05:34.960 --> 05:40.400
bought their Xboxes for the maddens and burnouts of the world, give them their really first

05:40.400 --> 05:44.560
experience in a Japanese RPG and try to get some people sucked into the world through

05:44.560 --> 05:45.560
that.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.560
I don't know.

05:46.560 --> 05:47.560
Just a thought.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.080
Kind of go back a little bit with the whole PlayStation network doing almost like the

05:51.080 --> 05:55.400
bring it home thing, I really do hope they do this because lately their downloads and

05:55.400 --> 05:58.480
stuff and their content online has been pretty crappy.

05:58.480 --> 06:03.920
And if they start kicking it up to maybe the Xbox Live level, that would be pretty awesome

06:03.920 --> 06:09.500
and that would definitely help them because I know right now the 360, there's no shortage

06:09.500 --> 06:13.040
of new demos and games coming out each week.

06:13.040 --> 06:18.000
All right, well I will definitely be looking forward to the Blue Dragon demo and I'll

06:18.000 --> 06:19.160
be downloading it.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.360
I'm sure as a lot of you folks listen to the show, we'll be.

06:22.360 --> 06:32.720
Well speaking of Xbox news, the Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be, excuse me, actually

06:32.720 --> 06:40.200
launched in Japan on October 11th and the price is going to be 47,800 yen, which in

06:40.200 --> 06:46.160
US dollars is 390, so they're getting it cheaper than we did.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.160
Good for them I guess.

06:47.160 --> 06:51.520
Well I guess they need to be selling more Xboxes over in Japan, so why not release it

06:51.520 --> 06:52.520
deep, eh?

06:52.520 --> 06:53.520
They're trying.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.800
All right, well if you're in Japan and you've been holding out for an Xbox 360, maybe now

06:57.800 --> 06:59.680
is the time, who knows.

06:59.680 --> 07:05.660
Well, kind of continuing on with the trend of exclusive games being lost, or not exclusive

07:05.660 --> 07:11.040
games being lost, but becoming exclusive for the 360 or being delayed on the PlayStation

07:11.040 --> 07:16.120
3, Fatal Inertia, this game has been delayed for a while, it's supposed to be I think a

07:16.120 --> 07:24.480
launch title for the PlayStation 3 and now it's finally going to be coming out in September.

07:24.480 --> 07:29.800
Now the only problem though is the PlayStation 3 version has been delayed indefinitely, so

07:29.800 --> 07:37.160
the Xbox 360 one will be arriving September 11th on my birthday, awesome, and PlayStation

07:37.160 --> 07:42.800
3 possibly later on if it's not canceled by then.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.800
Very interesting.

07:43.800 --> 07:47.720
I mean, there's been plenty of games like this, Splinter Cell, Devil Agent, Ghost Recon

07:47.720 --> 07:54.800
Advanced Warfighter 2, hell, Rainbow Six Vegas, just kind of continuing the trend that the

07:54.800 --> 07:59.560
PlayStation 3 is hard to develop for.

07:59.560 --> 08:06.860
This is very interesting, kind of taking another topic here from Xbox 360 world, Forza 2.

08:06.860 --> 08:10.040
You know, you can create your own cars in Forza 2, right?

08:10.040 --> 08:13.800
And you can create these cars and you can actually sell them in their little online

08:13.800 --> 08:14.800
auction.

08:14.800 --> 08:19.520
Well, I'm surprised it took this long for a story like this to come out, but some knucklehead

08:19.520 --> 08:26.400
has put up this car that says, White Power, Hail Hitler, you know, all that crap.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.760
It's probably some 13-year-old trying to look cool, which this is not cool, but you know,

08:30.760 --> 08:34.080
somebody made this car and put it up, there's a huge swastika on the hood and everything,

08:34.080 --> 08:39.520
ah, just all this crap, they put up there on the little online marketplace thing within

08:39.520 --> 08:42.520
Forza, a little online auction where you can buy the cars.

08:42.520 --> 08:47.440
And of course, one of the blogs, it looks like 360 Gamer, got a picture of it, put it

08:47.440 --> 08:51.640
on the internet, of course this exposes this whole problem to what happens when you let

08:51.640 --> 08:54.800
users sell their custom-created cars on the game.

08:54.800 --> 09:00.320
I'm surprised it's this and not, you know, a giant twat on the hood of a car or something,

09:00.320 --> 09:02.280
it's all sorts of offensive things.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.120
Fuck me in the butt, like, written on the side of the car.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.400
I mean, this is just the tip of the iceberg, folks.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.280
So how exactly do you stop this from happening?

09:12.280 --> 09:15.120
Does a set of eyes have to look at every car that goes up?

09:15.120 --> 09:19.000
Do you just allow this kind of shit to go on there and hope that people will warn or

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
whatever they need to do?

09:20.000 --> 09:25.520
What you need to do is they should have something, you know, report abuse or report, you know,

09:25.520 --> 09:27.680
this as a, you know, something like that.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.600
You know, if it's, do you think if it's breaking, you know, the terms of service or whatever,

09:31.600 --> 09:36.520
have it be reported and then they can take it down, you know, kind of like eBay.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.120
You know, and of course, Microsoft has their whole little online user policy that says

09:40.120 --> 09:45.200
you won't use our services to discriminate against, you know, somebody for a race or

09:45.200 --> 09:48.640
whatever, even though whenever you sign on to Xbox Live and you play some online game,

09:48.640 --> 09:57.560
it's usually, you know, NNNNFFFF and all those, you know, words getting dropped like crazy.

09:57.560 --> 10:03.520
Part of the charm, and I say that with over sarcasm there, the charm of Xbox Live, that's

10:03.520 --> 10:05.760
why I only play Xbox Live with friends.

10:05.760 --> 10:10.040
I very rarely will play Xbox Live with strangers, and I rate every single one of them too.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.600
If I play Xbox Live with strangers, they get rated by me every time I rate them good or

10:13.600 --> 10:14.600
I rate them bad.

10:14.600 --> 10:22.000
It'll be interesting to see if Sony, what Sony does in their whole future plan for online

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
gaming as well.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.960
Well, other stuff.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.960
Yes.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.960
Yes.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.320
Other stuff has to do with Gears of War, the soundtrack.

10:34.320 --> 10:41.240
Usually the game is so popular that they are releasing the score to the game on soundtrack,

10:41.240 --> 10:46.000
you know, with tracks such as Train Ride to Hell.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.240
Wow, if I had known there were more songs like that in Gears of War, I might have tried

10:50.240 --> 10:54.760
to play it longer, although it was kind of frustrating me like crazy.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.760
You know what?

10:55.760 --> 11:00.100
They've been doing soundtracks to video games for years in Japan, and we're just now getting

11:00.100 --> 11:03.160
all this goodness, just in recent years.

11:03.160 --> 11:07.800
We've had some, like you'll get like spotty, like Gran Turismo 2 had a soundtrack, I remember

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
that.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.800
We do get the Silent Hill soundtracks over here.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.240
Yeah, they're very spotty, but you see them once in a while, but of course you think in

11:13.240 --> 11:16.960
Japan, my god, like every role-playing game that's major that come out of there has a

11:16.960 --> 11:20.320
deluxe soundtrack that comes out, five-disc Chrono Trigger soundtrack.

11:20.320 --> 11:24.320
With art books attached to them, like my Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.700
Kind of interesting that over here you get a Gears of War soundtrack, but you know, the

11:27.700 --> 11:30.600
game's still insanely popular, it's always in that top ten list of the lightest.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.280
Oh, they're doing this though, because these games come out, well I'd be like, well I really

11:34.280 --> 11:39.920
want the music to this, and you know, I've actually got the new whatever Mana game just

11:39.920 --> 11:40.920
came out soundtrack.

11:40.920 --> 11:45.560
Or how about like Grand Theft Auto, you know, Vice City.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.960
But that was all like actual, you know, radio music.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.680
How sad that they never came out with a box set for Grand Theft Auto 3, that had some

11:52.680 --> 11:56.520
pretty good stuff, especially on that like techno trance station that they had on there.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.640
I think that iTunes also opens the doors for a lot of this too, because there's more and

11:59.640 --> 12:01.520
more game music on iTunes lately.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.360
Like you know, I know we had a story a few weeks ago about how Konami put a lot of their

12:05.360 --> 12:10.580
old classic songs up there, so it's kind of neat what you can find online, and shopping

12:10.580 --> 12:12.360
online as well.

12:12.360 --> 12:19.320
Anyways, interesting things you can find online, excuses as to why the Red Rings of Death come

12:19.320 --> 12:21.000
up on your 360.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.520
One such excuse apparently is surge protectors.

12:25.520 --> 12:32.960
This is coming from gamepolitics.com, apparently somebody has been, or got a response back

12:32.960 --> 12:38.880
from Microsoft saying that the surge protector was the cause of the Red Rings of Death.

12:38.880 --> 12:43.600
And the reason, because the 360 is highly sensitive to reductions in power, even the

12:43.600 --> 12:50.140
slightest cut in power can cause things like the fans and DVD laser to malfunction.

12:50.140 --> 12:55.400
Surge protectors can cause this, and probably 90% of the consoles they've seen fail in

12:55.400 --> 12:59.600
6-12 months of being plugged into a surge protector.

12:59.600 --> 13:06.480
I call bullshit, since I believe the problem with 360's air malfunctioning is overheating,

13:06.480 --> 13:13.440
or actually the heat sink on the graphics chip becoming dislodged somehow because it

13:13.440 --> 13:18.040
gets so hot that the actual solder melts.

13:18.040 --> 13:24.760
So I'm not buying it, who cares, they're fixing it, there's a 3 year damn warranty

13:24.760 --> 13:25.760
on the things.

13:25.760 --> 13:29.880
Yes, we'll be talking more about that later on in the show, Microsoft's response to the

13:29.880 --> 13:33.320
whole Red Rings of Death thing, but first a game, let's play a game, because it's a

13:33.320 --> 13:36.880
little bit of a slow news week thanks to E3 being right around the corner, I mean there

13:36.880 --> 13:41.200
has been some big news this week as things start to leak out before E3, but during a

13:41.200 --> 13:44.200
slow news week we like to play a game, so tonight we're going to play a little bit of

13:44.200 --> 13:49.380
Listless.

13:49.380 --> 13:53.320
And the way that Listless works you guys, we're going to be creating the definitive

13:53.320 --> 13:58.160
list around a certain topic, and the 3 hosts here in studio are going to play, and Jonas

13:58.160 --> 14:01.360
is here with us, we haven't heard a lot from him in this segment, but he's been sitting

14:01.360 --> 14:04.760
here in studio with us, joined us during part 8, he's here with us, how you doing Jonas?

14:04.760 --> 14:05.760
Doing fine, you?

14:05.760 --> 14:08.480
Alright, very good, explicit, also known as in the online world.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.360
And you're going to be going to SacAnime this weekend too.

14:10.360 --> 14:14.280
Yes, and of course I've talked to you guys about SacAnime, not sure if you guys are going

14:14.280 --> 14:15.280
to be able to make it.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.120
We'll be there, we don't know about the panel yet though, so let us know.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.680
I'll try as much as I can to get you to get the panel there.

14:20.680 --> 14:24.280
For the whole 3 people in Sacramento listening to this program, because this is a worldwide

14:24.280 --> 14:25.280
show, but we're hoping to get more.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.280
That's why we're going.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.280
Yeah, I can help promote this stuff.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.280
Alright, sounds awesome.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.240
Alright, well anyway, we'll talk about that later, but tonight we're going to talk about

14:32.240 --> 14:38.940
Listless, and tonight's topic is the most random thing we'd like to see at E3 this year.

14:38.940 --> 14:44.440
Now this is how it's going to work, now you can do serious things, crazy things, stupid

14:44.440 --> 14:46.640
things, there is no limitation.

14:46.640 --> 14:50.200
You can be serious, you can be stupid, it doesn't matter because ultimately it will

14:50.200 --> 14:51.800
be in the hands of the chat room.

14:51.800 --> 14:56.320
The way this is going to work, I will name my top 3, as will Dark Sakura, Loki, and Explicit.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.440
Is this like a game or just events or things?

14:59.440 --> 15:02.560
It could be anything, it could be an event, something that happens at a press conference

15:02.560 --> 15:05.120
or it could be a game that's announced or whatever.

15:05.120 --> 15:09.080
So anyway, chat room, if you'd like to make some suggestions, you can start yelling those

15:09.080 --> 15:13.260
out in chat, but chat, you'll actually play an important part, because once we name our

15:13.260 --> 15:17.580
3 lists, then the fun part comes, we're going to go around and each one of us will take

15:17.580 --> 15:20.300
something off of the list.

15:20.300 --> 15:24.440
So that's going to leave us with a list of 8, in chat room you're going to vote for your

15:24.440 --> 15:28.980
favorites, and we will come up with a definitive list based on the chat room vote, that's how

15:28.980 --> 15:31.680
listless works.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.880
This is an old game we used to do years ago on my college radio show, it's lasted this

15:34.880 --> 15:35.880
long.

15:35.880 --> 15:40.720
Alright, anyway, so again the topic tonight, the most random thing we'd like to see at

15:40.720 --> 15:44.500
E3 this year, it doesn't matter, be serious, stupid, whatever you want, because the chat

15:44.500 --> 15:46.880
room will ultimately decide what it's going to be.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.400
So let's start it off, explicit, you're our guest tonight, why don't you start us off,

15:50.400 --> 15:55.520
what would be the third most random thing you'd like to see at E3 this year?

15:55.520 --> 15:57.720
Bill Gates getting pied in the face.

15:57.720 --> 16:02.120
Bill Gates getting pied in the face, ok of course that happened once, ok, so it's kind

16:02.120 --> 16:06.320
of, kind of, like go back to, go back to good old times, where you know, people would pie

16:06.320 --> 16:11.400
Bill Gates in the face, ok I like this, I'm going to write that, pie Bill Gates, and what's

16:11.400 --> 16:14.840
what's with the, why do you think someone would want to pie him in the face at E3?

16:14.840 --> 16:19.920
Well I mean it has happened before, ok, and you know everyone's talking about the red

16:19.920 --> 16:20.920
rings of death.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.400
Oh so you think someone will like, you know maybe a cherry pie, to put a red ring of death

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
on his face.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
Yes.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.840
Actually I shouldn't say that because somebody's going to totally misinterpret that.

16:28.840 --> 16:33.120
We don't mean someone should actually do this, but it would be kind of, it might happen.

16:33.120 --> 16:38.040
Come on, pies in the face are funny, that's what Bozo the Clown used to do.

16:38.040 --> 16:42.160
Alright, but if you actually do it, it's your ass that's going to jail.

16:42.160 --> 16:47.160
Alright anyhow, low key, if you would, your number 3 thing you would most like to see

16:47.160 --> 16:48.960
happen at E3?

16:48.960 --> 16:58.000
Nintendo actually releases online games, or games that are online, Nintendo actually releases

16:58.000 --> 17:02.420
an online game to the shock and awe of many, we knew, oh god this is inevitable, somebody

17:02.420 --> 17:04.760
was going to drop that one on us.

17:04.760 --> 17:11.400
Alright, say no more, alright, well let's see, I'm going to go next, because we'll save

17:11.400 --> 17:15.800
the best for last, Jamie.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.920
Alright my number 3 thing I would like to see happen at E3, I would like to see Sega

17:19.920 --> 17:24.440
publicly apologize for what they did to the Sonic franchise, I would like to see Sega

17:24.440 --> 17:30.840
have a press conference and go look, our bad, so that's my number 3 thing.

17:30.840 --> 17:34.480
Um, my number 3, if you're ready.

17:34.480 --> 17:38.560
I am, I was just typing that into the computer, Sega publicly apologized for Sonic, alright

17:38.560 --> 17:39.560
yes.

17:39.560 --> 17:49.680
I'm showing up killing everyone from G4.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.200
Lovely so Pyramid Head will come in there with his sexy self and kill everyone from

17:53.200 --> 17:58.880
G4, not really, because again we don't want to get sued or watched by the FBI or anything,

17:58.880 --> 18:04.000
we don't really mean that, but Pyramid Head could, you know, come in there and lay the

18:04.000 --> 18:06.800
smack down, this is silly or random.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.720
Alright, I hope the chatroom lighted, the Rob D says that is pretty random.

18:10.720 --> 18:15.880
Alright, uh, Jonas, your number 2 most random thing you'd like to see happen at E3.

18:15.880 --> 18:20.880
Alright, okay, um, I have the sense of this because Jamie said the person is banned in

18:20.880 --> 18:21.880
Orange Dawn's radio.

18:21.880 --> 18:28.320
Alright, uh, if it's, if the initials are JT, he who shall not be named, you can use

18:28.320 --> 18:30.800
that or Voldemort.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.600
Him showing up at E3.

18:33.600 --> 18:41.600
So Voldemort attends E3.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.400
That would be pretty random, what would he be doing at E3, because you know the rumor

18:44.400 --> 18:47.960
is he was going to go to Penny Arcade Expo but they couldn't work out an agreement there,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.760
so what would Lord Voldemort be doing at E3?

18:50.760 --> 18:53.720
Who knows, he'd probably try to censor as many games as possible.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.920
He'd be carrying the pie, that's what it is, that's what will happen.

18:57.920 --> 19:01.320
Alright there you go, uh, Loki, your number 2 most random thing you'd like to see happen

19:01.320 --> 19:02.320
at E3.

19:02.320 --> 19:08.520
Uh, less of what I, this is more than likely going to happen, um, because, you know, stupid

19:08.520 --> 19:09.760
things come out each year.

19:09.760 --> 19:15.520
But more crappy games announced based off TV series, like, uh, Dancing with the Stars

19:15.520 --> 19:21.000
or um, god, I don't know, are you smarter than a 5th grader?

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
Hey Paula the game, hey Paula the game, if there is a god in heaven, please do not make

19:29.000 --> 19:30.440
this happen.

19:30.440 --> 19:35.640
Hey Paula the game, uh, let's see, my number 2 thing I would like to see happen at E3,

19:35.640 --> 19:41.400
I would like to see Nintendo not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.520
That's what I'd like to see happen for once at E3, I'd like to see Nintendo not announce

19:44.520 --> 19:46.680
one of their systems out in a new color.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.320
I think that's self explanatory.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.320
Jamie?

19:49.320 --> 19:57.160
Number 2 should be we, um, be invited to be the official E3 podcasters.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.400
So Jamie's showing a little bit of ego there, OLR the official ambassadors to the podcasting

20:01.400 --> 20:03.560
universe for E3.

20:03.560 --> 20:08.520
So I'm going to put OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors, is that good?

20:08.520 --> 20:11.400
And why would they pick us?

20:11.400 --> 20:17.180
Because of my boobs, I don't know.

20:17.180 --> 20:20.720
So then ambassadors with emphasis on the ass.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.720
Whatever.

20:21.720 --> 20:30.120
Alright, OLR sells out at E308, uh, alright number 1, the number 1 thing you would like

20:30.120 --> 20:33.320
to see happen at E3 this year, uh, explicit.

20:33.320 --> 20:40.200
Okay, this might get me a little hated here, but um, Halo 3 delayed or cancelled.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.560
Halo 3 delayed or cancelled, that would be pretty funny.

20:42.560 --> 20:47.040
This would be funny, I wanted to see the, what the families would say about this if

20:47.040 --> 20:49.040
they say it was delayed.

20:49.040 --> 20:53.240
I don't, I don't actually see it, but remember this is random or whatever you want, so this

20:53.240 --> 20:56.880
is your little sick fantasy is that you want to see the Halo fanboys have a cry.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.880
Loki the number 1 thing you would like to see happen at E3 this year.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.440
This honestly is something I really hope to see.

21:03.440 --> 21:07.280
Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.200
And it actually sticks.

21:11.200 --> 21:14.680
Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date, or they could come out and say it's out today.

21:14.680 --> 21:23.000
Oh my god, if they did that on Xbox Live Arcade, oh, oh, that would be awesome.

21:23.000 --> 21:29.680
My number 1 thing is that I would like to see at E3 all the old Kensha Hall exhibitors

21:29.680 --> 21:32.000
picketing outside the auditorium.

21:32.000 --> 21:41.160
Or how about like, you know, pickaxes and torches and...

21:41.160 --> 21:44.760
Because they're chanting, hell no, we won't go, and all that stuff.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.760
Alright, Jamie, your number 1 thing.

21:47.760 --> 21:52.200
Sky's voice the game.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.800
Please explain this classic O.L.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.680
Aryan joke for the sake of our new listeners.

21:56.680 --> 22:02.240
It was Rob singing Bumblebee with different lyrics.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.560
So Konami announces Sky's voice the game.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.560
Yeah.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.040
It's their latest in their Bomani series.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.960
Thank you, my ego feels good for that.

22:08.960 --> 22:13.200
Alright, there we go, so let's recap the big list we have here.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.200
This is very wordy, you guys.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.960
You might have to kind of lean in a little bit to see this, but I'll make the font bigger

22:16.960 --> 22:18.800
there so we can all read.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.840
Let me just kind of make that nice and easily readable.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.840
Or not.

22:24.840 --> 22:25.840
Alright.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.840
Your arm's in the way, Rob.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
That was hard to read.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.840
I'm sorry, guys.

22:28.840 --> 22:29.840
We'll, of course, post this in chat.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.940
I can see if your arm wasn't there.

22:31.940 --> 22:33.240
I'm working on it.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.840
Okay, I'm trying to separate some of these out a little bit, the ones that went on two

22:36.840 --> 22:37.840
lines.

22:37.840 --> 22:38.840
Alright, here we go.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.400
The list as it stands right now.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.880
Most random things we'd like to see happen at E3 2007.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.480
Pie Bill Gates in the face.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.920
Nintendo actually releases an online game.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.600
Sega publicly apologizes for Sonic.

22:50.600 --> 22:54.880
Pyramid Head shows up and kills everyone from G4.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.300
Lord Voldemort goes to E3.

22:57.300 --> 23:01.900
More crappy games based off of TV series, like Hey Paula the Game.

23:01.900 --> 23:05.720
Nintendo not announces one of their systems coming out in a new color.

23:05.720 --> 23:10.360
OLR is named E3 Podcasting Ambassadors.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.880
Halo 3 is delayed or canceled.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.840
Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.

23:16.840 --> 23:20.800
Kensha Hall's exhibitors picket outside the theater.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.840
And Konami announces Sky's Voice the Game as the latest in the Bomani series.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.600
It's a pretty good list.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.580
But unfortunately, this list is not perfect.

23:29.580 --> 23:32.960
So we need to go around and take ones off the list.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.920
So explicit, we'll start with you.

23:35.920 --> 23:39.720
Which one of these items is not worthy of being on the list?

23:39.720 --> 23:41.520
They're all good, but...

23:41.520 --> 23:42.520
This is hard tonight.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.520
This is hard tonight.

23:43.520 --> 23:44.520
Yeah, this is hard.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.520
Hmm.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.520
Oh, man.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.520
Take something!

23:47.520 --> 23:55.560
I guess I'll have to play the little dance music while Jonas thinks there.

23:55.560 --> 24:02.840
I had to go with Nintendo and not announce one of their systems coming out in a new color.

24:02.840 --> 24:03.880
Because you know what's inevitable?

24:03.880 --> 24:05.560
That's actually going to happen, right?

24:05.560 --> 24:06.560
Yeah.

24:06.560 --> 24:10.880
Alright, so explicit takes out the line about Nintendo will not actually...

24:10.880 --> 24:11.880
Whatever.

24:11.880 --> 24:12.880
It's gone.

24:12.880 --> 24:13.880
Doesn't matter anymore.

24:13.880 --> 24:18.880
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

24:18.880 --> 24:23.840
No.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.200
Bill Gates getting pied in the face.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.960
Bill Gates is normally not really at these events too much, you know?

24:27.960 --> 24:30.920
If it was like Peter Moore getting pied in the face, maybe.

24:30.920 --> 24:32.480
I don't know.

24:32.480 --> 24:33.480
Alright.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.480
Let's see.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.480
What would I like to put off the list?

24:35.480 --> 24:37.120
I am going to pull off the list.

24:37.120 --> 24:41.440
I'm going to pull off Duke Nukem Forever gets a street date announced.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.560
Because come on, it's the laughing stock of the industry and we can't have that ruined

24:44.560 --> 24:45.560
at E3 this year.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
It was a good thought.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
It was a good one.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.560
This is just hard.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.560
It's a hard list.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.560
It's a hard list.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.560
So, Jamie gets the last to remove.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.240
What are you going to take off the list?

24:53.240 --> 24:55.200
He who shall not be named showing up at E3.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.200
Yeah.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.200
Because it ain't going to happen.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.200
Yeah, we wouldn't want that.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.000
It's invite only, bitch, and you're invited.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.880
We don't get to crash this party.

25:02.880 --> 25:03.880
Alright.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.840
Incoming large paste into chat.

25:05.840 --> 25:09.520
You guys are going to vote for your top two, your number one and your number two.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.760
The order is important.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.880
I will assume your first answer is the number one.

25:12.880 --> 25:17.440
You're going to send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

25:17.440 --> 25:21.320
You know, real quick, sorry, this is kind of an afterthought, but not on the list.

25:21.320 --> 25:27.360
It'd be funny to see the people at Gamecock, the ones doing the EIO thing, to actually

25:27.360 --> 25:32.640
have a Trojan rooster come to the E3 thing and try to see if they can get him to put

25:32.640 --> 25:33.640
it in there.

25:33.640 --> 25:37.800
Everyone will jump out and, you know, alright.

25:37.800 --> 25:41.280
Here are our finalists for tonight's list list and we're going to open up voting to

25:41.280 --> 25:42.680
the chat room right now.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.480
Vote for your number one and number two picks.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.680
We'll tally them up during the next few stories and reveal the answers to you later in the

25:47.680 --> 25:48.680
show.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.680
Here we go.

25:49.680 --> 25:50.680
Things we'd like to see at E307.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.760
Nintendo actually releases an online game.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.640
Sega publicly apologizes for what they did to Sonic.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.760
Pyramid Head shows up and kills everyone from G4.

25:58.760 --> 26:01.320
More crappy games based off of TV series.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.640
OLR named E3 podcasting ambassadors.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.760
Halo 3 delayed or canceled.

26:06.760 --> 26:09.600
Kensha Hall exhibitors pick it outside the theater.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.600
Sky's voice the game.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.320
Why didn't I take that off the list?

26:12.320 --> 26:15.200
Sky's voice the game announced by Konami.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.760
Alright, there you have it.

26:16.760 --> 26:20.280
Let's get back into the gaming news while the votes come in.

26:20.280 --> 26:23.700
And I'll start off with a story here, kind of going to PC gaming, which we haven't talked

26:23.700 --> 26:24.760
a lot about.

26:24.760 --> 26:28.520
And the quintessential these days PC game, I mean, it is the most popular.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.520
World of Warcraft.

26:29.520 --> 26:33.560
And of course, if you're a World of Warcraft player, you know that gold farmers are a pain

26:33.560 --> 26:35.160
in your ass.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.600
And Blizzard did a good job with their latest patch though.

26:37.600 --> 26:42.040
They really managed to squelch the amount of spam that was going out thanks to the limitations

26:42.040 --> 26:43.760
they made on trial accounts.

26:43.760 --> 26:46.440
But that just means the gold farmers have gotten a little more creative.

26:46.440 --> 26:50.240
I am actually still getting tell spam once in a great while from gold farmers, but it's

26:50.240 --> 26:51.560
gone way down.

26:51.560 --> 26:54.920
But this has got to be one of the most creative things we've seen in a long time.

26:54.920 --> 27:03.080
And that is that these folks now are creating level one gnome characters and killing themselves

27:03.080 --> 27:08.240
in the main alliance town of Ironforge and spelling out the name of their website.

27:08.240 --> 27:12.080
I'm not going to read the name of the website, but you can see pictures around the internet.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.720
All these corpses laid out in like.com such and such site.

27:16.720 --> 27:20.480
I don't want to plug the site because they're cunts for doing this to the game and need

27:20.480 --> 27:22.680
to just stay the hell out of the game.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.280
But you have to give them props at least for being creative.

27:25.280 --> 27:28.840
Why can't we see this kind of advertising in real life?

27:28.840 --> 27:34.260
Blizzard, by the way, one of their reps wrote on their own forums, I ask that any player

27:34.260 --> 27:37.600
that witnesses these to report them straight away.

27:37.600 --> 27:41.480
If you feel so inclined, you can also post the realm name and zone here and I can see

27:41.480 --> 27:45.160
what can be done about getting them handled that way.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.760
Please once it's reported, leave the bodies alone, do not linger around or huddle near

27:48.760 --> 27:49.760
the bodies.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.640
In other words, don't give them the attention that they're looking for.

27:52.640 --> 27:57.320
Apparently I read somewhere else, somebody actually caught one of these like midway through

27:57.320 --> 28:02.520
like it stopped and like you just see all these bodies saying.com, you don't see the

28:02.520 --> 28:06.080
rest of the site name because I guess the Blizzard folks banned the IPs for too long,

28:06.080 --> 28:08.680
but kind of a creative way to get around.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.080
If nothing else, it's very creative.

28:10.080 --> 28:13.720
I'll give them that even if they are annoying as hell.

28:13.720 --> 28:18.640
Going to the chat room, James Patrick says, that's awesome, dead body advertising is great.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.400
Sephiroth1215 says, yeah, it kind of sucks, but for those sad lives of WoW players, it

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
is really funny.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
Hey, wait a minute.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.400
That's me you're talking about.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.400
Jerk.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.400
All right.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.400
More news.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.400
Well, I tell you votes.

28:29.400 --> 28:37.520
Well, for anyone who plays Second Life, apparently there is now going to be a build of Tokyo

28:37.520 --> 28:42.880
in Second Life done by Tetsuya Mizuguchi.

28:42.880 --> 28:51.560
He's doing actually a reimagined Tokyo for the I'm trying to actually get a little bit

28:51.560 --> 28:52.560
more on that.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.560
Right.

28:53.560 --> 28:57.560
They're doing it actually completely recreated Tokyo from what it's saying.

28:57.560 --> 29:04.440
He wants to do what Tokyo appears to both locals and visitors, something that's a matter

29:04.440 --> 29:06.080
of perception.

29:06.080 --> 29:11.160
So as he's quoted, actually saying a museum of Japanese pop culture.

29:11.160 --> 29:14.000
So yeah.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Kind of interesting.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
I'd like to see how that turns out.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Yes, very.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.720
Even though I don't really want to play Second Life.

29:19.720 --> 29:26.320
Anyways, interesting thing also coming to PCs, Dead or Alive Online is coming to PCs

29:26.320 --> 29:31.640
pretty soon and it's supposed to be a brand new game in the series.

29:31.640 --> 29:37.080
It won't just be some stupid port and so yeah, you will be able to see the Dead or

29:37.080 --> 29:44.680
Alive jubilees, I guess, bouncing up and down on your PC in high res.

29:44.680 --> 29:45.680
Hooray.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.840
But you like that, yes?

29:47.840 --> 29:48.840
Oh yeah.

29:48.840 --> 29:49.840
Don't get me wrong.

29:49.840 --> 29:50.840
It's awesome.

29:50.840 --> 29:57.560
Unfortunately, as it is on PC, it's been done before by other companies and they've actually

29:57.560 --> 30:03.000
had it where you can strip clothes off of people and stuff while you're fighting in

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
the game.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.360
Well, hey, this Dead or Alive game, of course, there's a lot of Dead or Alive games on the

30:09.360 --> 30:14.240
Xbox 360, but thanks to the red rings of death, some folks have not been able to play them.

30:14.240 --> 30:19.040
Well, the internet threw a fit, even the UK was starting to investigate Microsoft and

30:19.040 --> 30:22.580
finally Microsoft this week said, all right, enough.

30:22.580 --> 30:23.580
We fucked up.

30:23.580 --> 30:24.800
We're sorry.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.720
Peter Moore came out and said, quote, you've spoken and we've heard you.

30:27.720 --> 30:30.880
Good service and a good customer experience are areas of the business that we care deeply

30:30.880 --> 30:31.880
about.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.280
Basically, we've not been doing a good enough job.

30:34.280 --> 30:39.460
As of today, all Xbox 360 consoles are covered by an enhanced warranty program to address

30:39.460 --> 30:43.520
specifically the general hardware failures indicated by the three flashing red lights

30:43.520 --> 30:44.600
on the console.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.360
This applies to new and previously sold consoles.

30:47.360 --> 30:51.760
So in other words, for three years, and the Xbox 360 hasn't even been out that long yet,

30:51.760 --> 30:52.760
your console's covered.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.600
If you get the three rings of death, you don't have to pay to have it fixed.

30:55.600 --> 30:58.800
That means all the people who bought extended warranties.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.120
Well, they may cover other failure.

31:01.120 --> 31:05.160
This is only for the three red rings of death, so the extended warranty does cover all the

31:05.160 --> 31:09.960
other things that could go wrong, but certainly a lot of folks are applauding Microsoft for

31:09.960 --> 31:10.960
this move.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.520
Now, it would be nice if the three red rings of death would never show up in the first

31:13.520 --> 31:17.880
place, but since Microsoft can't magically cure all the 360s that are already out there,

31:17.880 --> 31:20.520
I suppose this is the next best thing.

31:20.520 --> 31:25.280
Any thoughts from the folks here in studio on the whole warranty policy change?

31:25.280 --> 31:26.680
I think it's pretty cool.

31:26.680 --> 31:31.520
Glad to see that they're actually covering this stuff anyways.

31:31.520 --> 31:35.320
And then hopefully, I'm assuming since the rumors have been going around that they're

31:35.320 --> 31:40.680
redesigning the cooling on it, that this will fix the problem, and any of these consoles

31:40.680 --> 31:44.520
that are still out there that are failing because of this will get fixed, and we won't

31:44.520 --> 31:46.080
have to hear about it anymore.

31:46.080 --> 31:50.120
Apparently Peter Moore has actually joined our chat room, or someone impersonating him.

31:50.120 --> 31:55.160
Peter Moore says, we're sorry, have this three year warranty for the three red lights.

31:55.160 --> 31:59.240
See, one year for every light, there you go, bravo.

31:59.240 --> 32:00.240
Nice.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.320
So, there are three lights?

32:03.320 --> 32:05.520
I guess, yeah, I got the error one time.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.280
I'm joking, Rob.

32:08.280 --> 32:09.280
I hate you.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.280
You know what?

32:10.280 --> 32:11.280
Mailbag segment's canceled tonight.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.280
Okay.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.280
You can read it.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.280
No, I don't want to read it.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.000
I had to read it last week because you weren't here.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
When you send in your emails to mailbag at OrangeLivesReader.com, obviously we care very

32:20.000 --> 32:23.160
deeply about your emails that you send in to us.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.880
We fight over who gets to read them here on air.

32:25.880 --> 32:29.300
Dark Sakura's going to open up the old mailbag and read some of her favorites for you right

32:29.300 --> 32:32.160
here in the mailbag segment.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.840
Dark Sakura, dive in head first.

32:33.840 --> 32:34.840
Mailbag at OrangeLivesReader.com.

32:34.840 --> 32:35.840
Pull some emails out.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.560
What'd you get?

32:37.560 --> 32:39.840
The first one comes from Devin.

32:39.840 --> 32:45.320
Dear Rob, Jamie, and Loki, last week you put out the call for developers to listen to the

32:45.320 --> 32:47.980
show to write in, and in that regard, I qualified.

32:47.980 --> 32:52.380
Three weeks ago, I started working at Bottle Rocket Entertainment.

32:52.380 --> 32:59.000
The team responsible for the Mark of Kree and its sequel on PS2 as an environment artist.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Oh, that's cool.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.800
For the people unsure what that entails, it's pretty much what it sounds like.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.600
Environment artists build the art assets for the level in the game.

33:06.600 --> 33:10.840
Since I just started recently, I have no grizzled words from the trenches of the horrors of

33:10.840 --> 33:14.000
game development, but I wanted to write in anyway as I've been listening to your show

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
since last fall.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.720
Actually, I wanted to thank you guys for the work that you do.

33:17.720 --> 33:22.600
I listen to OLR and other podcasts at work, and it makes my day that much more enjoyable.

33:22.600 --> 33:26.200
In fact, aside from the caffeine, I basically had to subsist on podcasts to get me through

33:26.200 --> 33:29.160
the last bit of art school before I got this job.

33:29.160 --> 33:34.000
I love OLR in particular because your enthusiasm for your program shows, and as a result, every

33:34.000 --> 33:36.600
episode is guaranteed to entertain.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.600
Thank you for all the work you put into this.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
One last thing.

33:39.600 --> 33:44.000
My point of view of game development might be somewhat myopic at this point, but I know

33:44.000 --> 33:47.060
people have questions, and I might be able to provide some answers.

33:47.060 --> 33:50.520
I can't talk about anything related to the projects we're working on, but if any of your

33:50.520 --> 33:53.760
listeners want to know what it's like working in a game company or how best to break into

33:53.760 --> 33:58.160
the industry or anything like that, I might be able to help just putting that out there.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.320
Sincerely yours, Devin L.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.240
Well, maybe we'll have to have Devin on the show at some point.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.240
Ask a developer.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.240
That might be kind of fun.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.240
That'd be cool.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.200
But that's kind of neat to know that people on the inside are listening to the program,

34:08.200 --> 34:11.600
and that always makes us feel pretty good, you know.

34:11.600 --> 34:15.760
And certainly we were talking about the guy that worked for the Japanese developer.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.680
He actually was sending me some pictures from Japan.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.000
I actually have to show you.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.960
He sent me some pictures from a pinball arcade in Japan, so I have to show you.

34:21.960 --> 34:22.960
Nice.

34:22.960 --> 34:23.960
So, kind of cool.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.920
So thank you to the developers that listen to this show, just like any other listener.

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
We really appreciate your support.

34:27.920 --> 34:31.240
Well, we got one from the Rob D. Yes.

34:31.240 --> 34:34.520
I was listening to last week's show on the way home from work yesterday, and yes, my

34:34.520 --> 34:38.880
end quiz will label you as super spastic if you suck in that game.

34:38.880 --> 34:42.800
I'm always amused when an issue with this word comes up, because it shows a giant cultural

34:42.800 --> 34:46.240
divide between the USA and the UK that no one is really aware of.

34:46.240 --> 34:50.120
For whatever reason, the word spaz is highly offensive in the UK, even to the point of

34:50.120 --> 34:55.120
the Spastic Society, a nonprofit organization to aid those with cerebral palsy, changing

34:55.120 --> 34:56.840
its name to SCOPE.

34:56.840 --> 35:01.240
In the US, the surfer lingo of the SoCal area made the word spaz a common insult among youth

35:01.240 --> 35:02.240
to this date.

35:02.240 --> 35:08.280
A few years ago, Tiger Woods got in huge trouble with his UK fans when he said that he had

35:08.280 --> 35:12.240
played the best I've played for years, and as soon as I got on the green, I was a spaz

35:12.240 --> 35:13.960
during last year's Masters.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.920
Of course, Americans had no idea what the problem was.

35:15.920 --> 35:20.360
Merriam-Webster doesn't even mention cerebral palsy and its definition of the word spaz.

35:20.360 --> 35:24.080
A little side note, whenever I hear spastic, I think of spastic, colon.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.560
Anyway, back to the email.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.600
Although not the most popular, by far the worst and funniest documented case that's

35:29.600 --> 35:34.300
happening is when an American wheelchair manufacturer decided to export one of their products to

35:34.300 --> 35:35.600
Great Britain for sale there.

35:35.600 --> 35:40.000
Unfortunately, the name of this product was called, I kid you not, the spaz with two Z's.

35:40.000 --> 35:47.520
You can imagine how well that went over.

35:47.520 --> 35:51.480
On one hand, I feel sort of bad for the wheelchair company, but the name was cool in the first

35:51.480 --> 35:52.480
place.

35:52.480 --> 35:57.480
Isn't that kind of like selling a walker and calling it gimpy or marketing head gear for

35:57.480 --> 36:01.680
children with really bad teeth as the most unpopular kid in school brand?

36:01.680 --> 36:07.560
Anyway, I guess the closest analogy I can make is if some Asian company wanted to make

36:07.560 --> 36:11.360
a humorous shirt that said, I'm chicken on the front and accidentally, instead of using

36:11.360 --> 36:17.500
the word cock instead of chicken, not realizing how offensive it is.

36:17.500 --> 36:18.500
Great show.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.040
I keep up and keep up the good work.

36:21.040 --> 36:24.880
Maybe you'll actually get to 500 episodes like I accidentally said you already had on

36:24.880 --> 36:25.880
your five-year show.

36:25.880 --> 36:26.880
Rob D.

36:26.880 --> 36:31.640
You know, I find the term scope offensive because it makes me think of mouthwash, which

36:31.640 --> 36:36.100
in turn makes me think of the dentist and I find dentist to be highly offensive because

36:36.100 --> 36:39.480
of what they charge me when I go in there to have my teeth cleaned.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.640
So I find that term to be offensive.

36:41.640 --> 36:46.160
So obviously I'm just messing around, but you know, we learned, we learned a lot about

36:46.160 --> 36:48.600
some of those cultural word differences last week.

36:48.600 --> 36:52.200
You know, I had no idea that that was an offensive term over there, but you know, it's just a

36:52.200 --> 36:55.640
part of the world we live in and all those funny little cultural differences.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.880
So more stuff, more stuff.

36:58.880 --> 37:06.240
Oscar once again, thank you, um, and yeah, Rob, you were drunk, quit denying your past.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.320
I do this time.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.320
I'm just going to read.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.320
I swear.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.320
I wasn't drunk.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.720
I think that's what anybody thinks.

37:13.720 --> 37:17.000
Thanks a lot for introducing me to the song anniversary from powder, powder, paradise

37:17.000 --> 37:18.120
with a question mark.

37:18.120 --> 37:22.440
I've been listening to it every day, multiple times a day, bolded ever since.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.440
Yeah.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.440
Can you tell that I love it?

37:24.440 --> 37:25.440
So yay for Rob.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.440
Rob is cool.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.440
Rob fan mail for the wind.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.440
Yay.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.760
I want to get Loki or Jamie out.

37:29.760 --> 37:30.760
So you all kick ass.

37:30.760 --> 37:31.760
Smiley face.

37:31.760 --> 37:32.760
I'm boo.

37:32.760 --> 37:33.760
I want to be by myself.

37:33.760 --> 37:40.200
Rob, your beloved listener, Oscar PS supernova location test back on.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.960
Maybe during the time it was canceled, they made the game better.

37:42.960 --> 37:43.960
Thoughts.

37:43.960 --> 37:44.960
EMUs maybe.

37:44.960 --> 37:49.240
Uh, wasn't there some news on the whole supernova testing this week?

37:49.240 --> 37:50.360
Like it's back on now.

37:50.360 --> 37:55.320
In fact, I think it was posted to our own site, but that was the wonderful, the wonderful

37:55.320 --> 37:57.920
dark Tetsuya actually stays on top of a lot of that stuff.

37:57.920 --> 37:58.920
Apparently.

37:58.920 --> 37:59.920
Yeah.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.520
The supernova two test is back on again for July 12th, 2007.

38:02.520 --> 38:06.840
That's funny because that would be right around the same time as E3, but yeah, that's what

38:06.840 --> 38:08.760
is floating around the internet apparently.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.320
All right.

38:10.320 --> 38:14.480
So can I read more email please?

38:14.480 --> 38:15.480
Of course.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.480
Thank you sir.

38:16.480 --> 38:17.480
May I have another?

38:17.480 --> 38:18.800
Hi, Orange Launch Radio.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.960
This is a quick email from Maury.

38:20.960 --> 38:25.560
Um, unfortunately for the past two weeks, my computer has been relatively out of commission,

38:25.560 --> 38:28.440
so I wasn't able to send along this message any sooner.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.000
Excuses, excuses.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.520
But congrats on five years and two weeks and two weeks of being on the air, uh, five years

38:35.520 --> 38:36.520
and two weeks as of today.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.520
Yeah.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.880
I've listened to your show for about a year and a half now and since the last few episodes

38:40.880 --> 38:44.920
of the original OLR to go edition of the podcast, you guys are the only show that I can actually

38:44.920 --> 38:47.840
sit down and listen to all the way without losing interest and short.

38:47.840 --> 38:48.840
You guys are great.

38:48.840 --> 38:49.840
Thanks.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.080
And we have a tilde at the end of the things.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.080
Thank you.

38:52.080 --> 38:56.600
But besides that, a few weeks ago I heard someone mention the Sega Pico at one point

38:56.600 --> 38:57.600
in the episodes.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.600
I have fond memories of mine, which is currently sitting in a box in my closet.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.600
I actually pulled it out and played around with it after hearing that basically it was

39:03.600 --> 39:05.280
Sega and edutainment.

39:05.280 --> 39:09.200
I did, however, have something vaguely resembling a touch pad, which I forgot about.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.680
Any who, considering the apparently huge amount of systems Dark Sakura owns, by any chance

39:12.680 --> 39:14.180
does she have one?

39:14.180 --> 39:18.040
This has been something I've been wondering about for a while since obviously I have nothing

39:18.040 --> 39:19.040
better to do.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.420
Um, actually I do not own a Pico.

39:21.420 --> 39:26.280
I came very close to purchasing a Pico at Toys R Us, but we bought a Nomad instead.

39:26.280 --> 39:30.600
I figured Nomad Pico, you know, Nomad high on the pedestal.

39:30.600 --> 39:37.240
However, I actually have been looking for a Pico since last week, but bills and I'm

39:37.240 --> 39:43.200
going to Disneyland at the end of the month, so Disneyland greater than Pico.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.200
Tea cups are better than Pico.

39:44.200 --> 39:48.320
I know and I'm going to freaking ride the hell out because the tea cups go faster at

39:48.320 --> 39:49.320
night, Rob.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.480
I'm going to get you for going to Disneyland on the weekend, I have to move, which in turn

39:52.480 --> 39:57.440
will probably be no OLR that week, but you know, we're changing studios, so yes.

39:57.440 --> 40:00.640
And in closing, thanks again for your awesomeness and I hope to actually call in on the show

40:00.640 --> 40:01.640
one day.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.360
Oh, and Sky's game tap promotion made me subscribe to it.

40:04.360 --> 40:08.120
Not quite as big of a purchase as a $60 game, but still, I thought it was worth mentioning

40:08.120 --> 40:12.260
Maury, possibly the second youngest listener at 14.

40:12.260 --> 40:17.400
That doesn't help because people think I'm already like up there in bed with them, but

40:17.400 --> 40:18.400
I swear I'm not.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.560
I just, you know, think they're good.

40:20.560 --> 40:28.760
Well, I have to say though, 14 and having, I have to say for a 14 year old, you have

40:28.760 --> 40:34.540
some of the best grammar in an email I have ever seen.

40:34.540 --> 40:36.720
Nothing was misspelled.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.240
You had one typo.

40:39.240 --> 40:46.220
I have to say that you are shining example of the educate, of our public education system

40:46.220 --> 40:49.040
working unless you go to private school.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.040
So who's this again?

40:50.040 --> 40:51.040
Maury.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.800
Maury, our listener of the week, everybody give it up.

40:53.800 --> 40:57.500
You are the, you are the emailer of the millennium.

40:57.500 --> 41:00.440
So there you go.

41:00.440 --> 41:05.160
This one is by Schwall 22, I guess.

41:05.160 --> 41:09.780
Hey guys, been a while since I've written and I had to create Loki's misuse of a word

41:09.780 --> 41:11.280
last week.

41:11.280 --> 41:15.280
When referring to a mentally handicapped person, it's a retard example.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.720
That guy is a fucking retard.

41:17.720 --> 41:23.520
When referring to music, that's r-i-t-a-r-d, short for retardando, which means to gradually

41:23.520 --> 41:25.880
become slower.

41:25.880 --> 41:29.800
I actually was the one last week that said that retard is used in music, but I knew it

41:29.800 --> 41:32.480
was the misspelling, but you still say it the same way.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.600
Well, that's just two different spellings, same pronunciation.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.200
Oh well, keep up the good work.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.360
I really have been enjoying the show.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.840
Oh, oh, more people should play Overlord.

41:40.840 --> 41:41.840
It's funny as hell.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.840
Buy it so we get a sequel.

41:43.840 --> 41:44.840
Okay.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.840
Will do, chief.

41:46.840 --> 41:49.960
Hey, Loki, retard your anger.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.160
Next email, last email is from NintendoManiac64.

41:52.160 --> 41:58.440
Hi, hola, bonjour, guten tag, konnichiwa, et cetera, although actually it's evening

41:58.440 --> 42:01.480
for us, so it would be konbanwa, anyway.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.800
Oh my god, picky lady.

42:04.800 --> 42:05.800
This is me, Rob.

42:05.800 --> 42:06.800
I'm gonna go get a water.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.080
Oh, whatever.

42:08.080 --> 42:11.680
This question is pretty much unrelated to OLR, but I may need the input by a largest

42:11.680 --> 42:16.760
group of people, aka the chat room, and not be completely ignored due to the uber speed

42:16.760 --> 42:20.520
that the comments travel at in the said chat room.

42:20.520 --> 42:26.680
Anyway, I'm finally going to be in an M3 perfect, which is the slot two version to replace my

42:26.680 --> 42:30.200
broken supercard CF, which had a connector pin.

42:30.200 --> 42:34.400
This has nothing to do with the, well, you said it had nothing to do with the show.

42:34.400 --> 42:39.720
Okay chat room, I'm just gonna read the question, okay.

42:39.720 --> 42:43.680
It said, to replace my broken supercard CF, which had a connector pin and the CF slot

42:43.680 --> 42:44.680
break off.

42:44.680 --> 42:47.320
Yes, I tried to solder it back, and it still doesn't work.

42:47.320 --> 42:51.160
My question is, if you or the chat room know if there are any mini or micro SD cards that

42:51.160 --> 42:58.480
are four gigabyte but not SDHC, since the M3 perfect isn't compatible with SDHC.

42:58.480 --> 43:01.880
I'm still not sure if I'm gonna get a two gig or a four gig SD card, but if there are

43:01.880 --> 43:08.880
any four gigabyte mini or micro non-SDHC cards, my problem is solved right there.

43:08.880 --> 43:14.720
And if anyone yells in the chat room and get an R4 or something, he needs 32 megabyte of

43:14.720 --> 43:15.720
extra RAM.

43:15.720 --> 43:16.720
Okay, whatever.

43:16.720 --> 43:17.720
This has nothing to do with the show.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.140
I'm not gonna read your answer.

43:20.140 --> 43:22.320
Email people, okay.

43:22.320 --> 43:26.480
Your answer, your question fails.

43:26.480 --> 43:30.000
And we have an email from Sauce.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.320
This says, dear Rob, there are four lights.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.720
Love Tiara.

43:33.720 --> 43:34.720
Yes.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.640
There are four lights, but only three show.

43:36.640 --> 43:43.920
I can't wait to play Rob's Voice the Game 2, Iraqi Suicide Babies.

43:43.920 --> 43:47.520
I'm sorry, I left the room when I heard Nintendo Maniac 64 send an email, but then I heard

43:47.520 --> 43:48.520
my name.

43:48.520 --> 43:49.520
Just kidding, hearts.

43:49.520 --> 43:50.520
What's that?

43:50.520 --> 43:51.520
This email's from Sauce.

43:51.520 --> 43:52.520
Dear Rob, there are four.

43:52.520 --> 43:56.080
Yes, but when the system breaks, there's only three that come on.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.800
But, but, but, but.

43:57.800 --> 43:58.800
What's it say?

43:58.800 --> 43:59.800
P.S.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.400
I can't wait to play Rob's Voice the Game 2, Iraqi Suicide Babies.

44:01.400 --> 44:04.720
Because four blinking lights means that your AVC is unplugged.

44:04.720 --> 44:08.760
Best email ever, except for the 14-year-old that can spell shit.

44:08.760 --> 44:11.760
All right, close the mailbag.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.080
We're way over time.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.360
Mailbag is belated.

44:14.360 --> 44:18.800
All right, if you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelaundrado.com, and maybe

44:18.800 --> 44:21.800
Jamie will make fun of you on air next.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.160
Or compliment your grammar.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.440
I would actually like to see, we should have a grammar contest.

44:25.440 --> 44:28.880
Let's see if there's some 13 and 12-year-olds that want to send in some emails and try to

44:28.880 --> 44:29.880
one-up Maury.

44:29.880 --> 44:31.880
Wouldn't that be exciting?

44:31.880 --> 44:32.880
Awesome.

44:32.880 --> 44:40.080
So, anyways, I guess the ongoing quest to get Mother 3 translated is going pretty well.

44:40.080 --> 44:46.960
Now two teams have kind of joined forces on the project, and I don't know.

44:46.960 --> 44:52.600
No word on yet when it's going to be done, but, well, actually, no, I guess there was

44:52.600 --> 44:53.600
a small update.

44:53.600 --> 45:02.240
They said that they're shooting for a release this year, so, awesome, I guess?

45:02.240 --> 45:03.240
I don't know.

45:03.240 --> 45:07.520
Not much a fan of Mother 3, but, great.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.740
I fucking love Earthbound.

45:08.740 --> 45:12.020
Why doesn't Nintendo, I don't know, translate the game themselves?

45:12.020 --> 45:19.040
Because they're dumbasses, because they would rather redo Pit Cross and release it on the

45:19.040 --> 45:20.040
DS.

45:20.040 --> 45:21.840
There's so much Nintendo hate tonight.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.880
I apologize to the Nintendo fans, but I don't.

45:23.880 --> 45:24.880
It's all right.

45:24.880 --> 45:26.280
Next week will be Nintendo love.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.280
That's true.

45:27.280 --> 45:33.080
I know there's a lot of love for this this week.

45:33.080 --> 45:38.120
Rock Band had some footage hit the internet, and a lot of folks were very, very happy about

45:38.120 --> 45:39.120
this.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.680
I'm going to play this in studio here, because I'm sure not everybody has seen it.

45:41.680 --> 45:42.680
Oh, never mind, I can't.

45:42.680 --> 45:45.960
It got taken off YouTube.

45:45.960 --> 45:50.520
But basically, okay, imagine Guitar Hero side by side three times, then Karaoke Revolution

45:50.520 --> 45:51.520
on top.

45:51.520 --> 45:56.040
That's kind of what Rock Band looked like, and the video I guess was leaked to the internet,

45:56.040 --> 46:00.320
so then Harmonics kind of had to step in and put something a little more legit out there

46:00.320 --> 46:04.720
and kind of confessed to what was going on, and mentioned that the song that you heard

46:04.720 --> 46:08.920
in there, Welcome to the Jungle, was just a demo song and may not actually be in the

46:08.920 --> 46:09.920
final version of the game.

46:09.920 --> 46:11.260
But that was so awesome.

46:11.260 --> 46:12.480
It looked like a shitload of fun.

46:12.480 --> 46:13.480
Did you guys see the clip?

46:13.480 --> 46:14.480
Oh my God, yes.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.000
Yeah, it looks good.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.080
The only negative complaint I've heard on it is that maybe the karaoke part is too small,

46:20.080 --> 46:21.840
which could be very hard to see on a regular TV.

46:21.840 --> 46:24.280
I don't know about that, but it looked pretty good.

46:24.280 --> 46:28.680
But doesn't everybody have a widescreen HDTV these days, huh?

46:28.680 --> 46:30.160
It's not so much that, but shouldn't everyone...

46:30.160 --> 46:31.760
Sony thinks so.

46:31.760 --> 46:33.840
Shouldn't everyone know the lyrics to Welcome to the Jungle?

46:33.840 --> 46:35.460
I mean, shouldn't you know this song by heart?

46:35.460 --> 46:37.460
I don't know the lyrics.

46:37.460 --> 46:39.160
Welcome to the Jungle!

46:39.160 --> 46:40.900
Well yeah, I know parts of it.

46:40.900 --> 46:41.900
I don't know...

46:41.900 --> 46:42.900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

46:42.900 --> 46:44.320
See, I could just make it up.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.320
I don't need the...

46:45.320 --> 46:48.720
You know, there's other words in there too, but who cares?

46:48.720 --> 46:51.040
Will this game let you cheat like Karaoke Revolution does?

46:51.040 --> 46:55.240
No, they supposedly have a thing that detects the phonics in your voice, so that you're

46:55.240 --> 47:00.200
not going to be able to go, you know, like, what was it?

47:00.200 --> 47:04.640
It's the end of the world as we know it, where it's like, uh, you know, the whole song.

47:04.640 --> 47:06.640
That's how I sing It's the End of the World as we know it in Karaoke Revolution.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.640
Have you ever played any of the Japanese versions of Karaoke Revolution?

47:09.640 --> 47:10.760
I have not.

47:10.760 --> 47:14.000
They actually make sure that you are pronouncing everything right.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Wow.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.280
They're very, very specific.

47:19.280 --> 47:20.280
Let's see.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.920
Rob D says that was the greatest rendition of Welcome to the Jungle ever.

47:22.920 --> 47:23.920
Why they...

47:23.920 --> 47:27.240
See why they want Sky's voice in the game?

47:27.240 --> 47:31.520
Ego plus five right there.

47:31.520 --> 47:35.600
Plus four strength, plus four stamina, plus four ego.

47:35.600 --> 47:39.680
Act Deft says, is telling the Rob D, Harmonic says it won't be that expensive.

47:39.680 --> 47:44.880
Oh, because the Rob D said Rock Band equals expensive game I won't be buying.

47:44.880 --> 47:45.880
So I don't know.

47:45.880 --> 47:47.240
It could be fun though.

47:47.240 --> 47:50.040
Jamie will buy it because she loves those types of games.

47:50.040 --> 47:57.080
Actually, I will probably get suckered into buying it like I did with Guitar Hero 2 and

47:57.080 --> 48:00.640
then I won't play it again.

48:00.640 --> 48:01.640
Gonna be good times.

48:01.640 --> 48:04.960
I will not do the Karaoke portion of the game though.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.760
I think I might.

48:06.760 --> 48:07.760
Please.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.760
No.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.440
One time on the show do the Karaoke.

48:10.440 --> 48:11.440
Never.

48:11.440 --> 48:12.440
Please.

48:12.440 --> 48:13.440
Can't you do Welcome to the Jungle?

48:13.440 --> 48:16.160
No, but you just did such a wonderful rendition.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.160
Oh, shut up.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.160
I hate you.

48:18.160 --> 48:23.080
Well, even though I hate Loki right now, I still love Jamie for now.

48:23.080 --> 48:27.480
So I will allow her a chance to share with you all her website of the week because she

48:27.480 --> 48:28.480
was out last week.

48:28.480 --> 48:31.080
So she's got to make it extra good this week.

48:31.080 --> 48:32.080
Dark Sakura.

48:32.080 --> 48:33.080
I was dead sore last week.

48:33.080 --> 48:38.440
Where should the kids be pointing their websites, browsers this week?

48:38.440 --> 48:47.400
The website of the week is newsescue.com because it's Kevin Smith and I don't need to tell

48:47.400 --> 48:49.400
you anything else.

48:49.400 --> 48:50.680
It's freaking Kevin Smith.

48:50.680 --> 48:54.920
So it's like news for View Askew, which is Kevin Smith's production company.

48:54.920 --> 48:56.720
Yes, it's Kevin Smith.

48:56.720 --> 48:57.720
So just go.

48:57.720 --> 49:00.880
And there's a link on there for drinking games too for each of the movies.

49:00.880 --> 49:02.400
Oh, that's fun.

49:02.400 --> 49:04.680
I think that is really awesome.

49:04.680 --> 49:05.680
Good times.

49:05.680 --> 49:06.680
Newsescue.com.

49:06.680 --> 49:12.300
There is a View Askew website and one of the others is moviepoopshoot.com.

49:12.300 --> 49:15.040
One thing I always liked about Kevin Smith, from what I remember, because I was reading

49:15.040 --> 49:18.720
up on Dogma a lot because I was really interested in that movie when it first came out and I

49:18.720 --> 49:23.680
liked the movie a lot, I seem to remember that Kevin Smith will actually post on his

49:23.680 --> 49:24.680
forums and stuff.

49:24.680 --> 49:33.080
He's actually got a blog update too called My Boring Ass Life.

49:33.080 --> 49:37.320
The internet did forgive him for Jersey Girl though, right?

49:37.320 --> 49:38.320
I think so.

49:38.320 --> 49:39.320
I think it's fair to say.

49:39.320 --> 49:40.320
I never did see Clerks too though.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.320
I should hang my head in shame.

49:41.320 --> 49:42.400
I need to go rent it.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.480
I do need to see it.

49:43.480 --> 49:44.560
How did I miss it?

49:44.560 --> 49:46.280
I just don't watch any movies anymore.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.280
It's sad.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.760
And Kevin Smith has a MySpace too.

49:49.760 --> 49:50.760
Does he?

49:50.760 --> 49:51.760
I should add him.

49:51.760 --> 49:52.760
I love The Evening With Kevin Smith.

49:52.760 --> 49:54.760
That's one of my favorite DVDs ever.

49:54.760 --> 49:55.760
All right.

49:55.760 --> 49:56.760
Newsescue.com.

49:56.760 --> 50:00.080
Check it out when you're taking a break from the games.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.080
Has Kevin Smith admitted he plays video games?

50:02.080 --> 50:03.080
I would imagine he does.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.080
He seems like a big nerd.

50:04.080 --> 50:05.080
I don't think so.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.640
Well, how come there hasn't been a Jay and Silent Bob video game?

50:07.640 --> 50:09.440
That's what I want to know.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.440
Maybe someday.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.440
Good question.

50:11.440 --> 50:18.960
Anywho, there's some interesting news coming from Australia.

50:18.960 --> 50:26.880
Apparently a sort of affair between a 31-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy went awry and

50:26.880 --> 50:30.300
she was arrested for kidnapping charges.

50:30.300 --> 50:38.280
The whole thing took place over World of Warcraft where apparently the 31-year-old, I'm just

50:38.280 --> 50:44.760
going to assume that she was a MILF, because she's, well, no, of course not.

50:44.760 --> 50:47.480
Anyways, then again, if she's hitting on 17-year-old boys, who knows?

50:47.480 --> 50:48.480
I know.

50:48.480 --> 50:49.480
MILF?

50:49.480 --> 50:52.600
Does that mean like mom is large and fat?

50:52.600 --> 50:55.600
Is that MILF?

50:55.600 --> 51:06.540
Anyways, so apparently she was creating this deep and trusting relationship with her barely

51:06.540 --> 51:09.180
legal boyfriend for more than a year.

51:09.180 --> 51:13.760
How do you form a deep and trusting relationship on World of Warcraft?

51:13.760 --> 51:20.440
I will give you this four-strength, four-stamp leather belt if you will eat my pussy.

51:20.440 --> 51:21.440
I don't know.

51:21.440 --> 51:26.240
How do you do that?

51:26.240 --> 51:28.240
Or I'll give you a Leeroy Jenkins.

51:28.240 --> 51:33.320
Is that a new sexual term?

51:33.320 --> 51:35.640
Is that what these two say during, oh, I shouldn't even say that.

51:35.640 --> 51:37.640
I shouldn't use that, that's bad.

51:37.640 --> 51:38.640
Never mind.

51:38.640 --> 51:46.680
But anyways, apparently she was going to meet the boy and they were going, because she lived

51:46.680 --> 51:51.640
in Australia, but she was going to meet him, I guess he lived out of country, and basically

51:51.640 --> 51:55.920
take him with her and they were going to fly to Australia and he was going to live with

51:55.920 --> 51:56.920
her.

51:56.920 --> 52:00.680
Apparently, the parents found out about it and had her arrested.

52:00.680 --> 52:02.760
Wait, so she was Australian?

52:02.760 --> 52:03.760
Yeah.

52:03.760 --> 52:04.760
Oh, wow.

52:04.760 --> 52:12.160
What's wrong with you guys in Australia and your MILFs and, no, I'm just kidding, obviously

52:12.160 --> 52:14.080
it's one bad apple ruining the barrel.

52:14.080 --> 52:20.600
I'm sure the media hasn't gone crazy with this story about how World of Warcraft is

52:20.600 --> 52:26.400
predator for children and blah, blah, blah, Dateline NBC special about the scary MILFs

52:26.400 --> 52:31.360
on Warcraft reaching out, buying plane tickets for 17-year-old boys.

52:31.360 --> 52:38.600
The boy lived in North Carolina, so I would assume that the age of consent, of course,

52:38.600 --> 52:41.040
here is usually over 18.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.040
That's a long plane ride.

52:42.040 --> 52:46.360
He'll probably be 18 by the time he gets to Australia, so what's so wrong with that?

52:46.360 --> 52:49.640
The time zone changes and the Dateline, you know?

52:49.640 --> 52:50.640
Exactly.

52:50.640 --> 52:51.640
He's 18.

52:51.640 --> 52:52.640
Exactly.

52:52.640 --> 52:55.840
All right, well we are just about done with all these stories for tonight and we are going

52:55.840 --> 52:59.640
to be opening up the Skype line for you guys to call in and interact with our program.

52:59.640 --> 53:02.200
If you want to give us a call, you can call us on Skype.

53:02.200 --> 53:06.200
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio or you can call us on our 800 number or I should say

53:06.200 --> 53:07.920
877 number.

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

53:08.920 --> 53:15.920
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

53:15.920 --> 53:23.400
We will take your calls very soon, however, first we have another score to settle and

53:23.400 --> 53:26.480
that's tonight's List List.

53:26.480 --> 53:28.400
We need to know who won tonight's List List.

53:28.400 --> 53:32.720
The topic tonight, of course, most random things we'd like to see at this year's E3.

53:32.720 --> 53:36.000
We have winners and let's reveal them now.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.640
Number three, the number three thing our chat room would like to mostly happen to E3 this

53:39.640 --> 53:43.800
year, Halo 3 gets delayed or canceled.

53:43.800 --> 53:47.460
A lot of bitterness towards Halo 3 in our chat room.

53:47.460 --> 53:51.460
The number two thing, according to the OrangeLoungeRadio listeners and therefore the definitive

53:51.460 --> 53:57.520
number two thing that must happen at E3 this year, Konami announces Sky's Voice the Game.

53:57.520 --> 54:02.600
The number two thing that happens this year and the number one thing that the folks would

54:02.600 --> 54:07.080
like to see happen at E3 this year, so this must happen, this is the number one demand

54:07.080 --> 54:08.080
of the people.

54:08.080 --> 54:12.840
This is the people saying this must happen.

54:12.840 --> 54:16.040
Pyramid Head must show up and kill everyone for E4.

54:16.040 --> 54:23.200
There you have it, tonight's definitive List of the needs of E3 2007.

54:23.200 --> 54:29.480
All right, let's open up the Skype line and take some calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

54:29.480 --> 54:32.440
Did they do a good job tonight, you think?

54:32.440 --> 54:34.160
I think they did a good one, I don't know.

54:34.160 --> 54:37.400
I think they came up with a good list, I don't know what you guys think.

54:37.400 --> 54:39.080
All right, let's go to the phones.

54:39.080 --> 54:42.040
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

54:42.040 --> 54:43.040
Ravenstaufen.

54:43.040 --> 54:46.760
Oh, surprise, surprise, how did you get through Ravenstaufen?

54:46.760 --> 54:48.200
My new Mac, that's why.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.800
Do you have us on speed dial?

54:49.800 --> 54:50.800
Yes.

54:50.800 --> 54:52.720
All right, well it worked.

54:52.720 --> 54:54.280
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

54:54.280 --> 55:00.320
Well, the E3's coming up and I know everyone's really excited and the thing about it is it's

55:00.320 --> 55:01.320
very small.

55:01.320 --> 55:05.880
Does it feel weird to you that it's now instead of it was in May?

55:05.880 --> 55:10.240
To me, it was around my birthday and I was like, yeah, E3's coming up and I'm like, now

55:10.240 --> 55:13.080
it's like E3's up?

55:13.080 --> 55:16.160
Well yeah, but at the same time as we were kind of saying in part A, just because it's

55:16.160 --> 55:19.840
a smaller show doesn't mean the companies have any less or more to gain and there's

55:19.840 --> 55:25.640
going to be press there that's just as, you know, as honest as there were in years past.

55:25.640 --> 55:28.800
I think enough people have managed to get in even though it's supposed to be a lockdown

55:28.800 --> 55:30.000
show or whatever.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.720
So I don't really see what's exactly changed except for the fact that, you know, little

55:34.720 --> 55:41.280
podcasters like us and little press and foreign press and GameStop employees don't get in

55:41.280 --> 55:43.680
and Best Buy employees and all that crap.

55:43.680 --> 55:45.240
Yeah, I guess you're right.

55:45.240 --> 55:49.240
You know, we're still going to get the press conferences like we normally do.

55:49.240 --> 55:54.000
So I don't see much of a change like you said, you know, we're still going to see it.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.680
Yeah, I don't know.

55:55.680 --> 55:58.960
I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens as E3 goes on.

55:58.960 --> 56:03.640
It's going to be hard to say, you know, and it's, and you could say that, you know, people,

56:03.640 --> 56:07.160
there's not as many people to tear apart the demos or base their opinion of games right

56:07.160 --> 56:11.760
off the demos, but you're seeing the whole Xbox Live and PlayStation 3 become more and

56:11.760 --> 56:13.080
more and more.

56:13.080 --> 56:14.080
You know what I mean?

56:14.080 --> 56:18.840
Like you can download those on their own live or PlayStation Network services so you can

56:18.840 --> 56:21.200
get a lot of those demos actually.

56:21.200 --> 56:24.400
I'm really excited for actually bringing it home.

56:24.400 --> 56:28.160
And that's going to be really interesting because they did an okay job with it last

56:28.160 --> 56:29.160
year.

56:29.160 --> 56:33.160
But for the people like me saying home, I lost planets on Xbox Live.

56:33.160 --> 56:38.440
I was at E3 last year and I still enjoyed the Xbox Live, you know, watching their videos

56:38.440 --> 56:41.520
from the show floor because I kind of actually liked seeing some of the boosts I went to

56:41.520 --> 56:42.840
at E3 was kind of fun.

56:42.840 --> 56:43.840
So I don't know.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.160
Maybe I'm just weird like that.

56:45.160 --> 56:46.880
Yeah, I'll be home too.

56:46.880 --> 56:48.400
But Scott got that thing on his head.

56:48.400 --> 56:50.280
Yeah, I heard about that over at Allgame.

56:50.280 --> 56:51.480
What the hell is that?

56:51.480 --> 56:54.040
He got he bought a webcam for his head.

56:54.040 --> 56:55.100
He's going to E3.

56:55.100 --> 57:00.720
See with stuff like that, you're not going to keep people out of E3.

57:00.720 --> 57:03.720
Where there is information, there will be people seeking it out.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.040
One more thing, Ravenstauven?

57:05.040 --> 57:06.640
Yeah, one more thing.

57:06.640 --> 57:10.440
You know, I just bought this Mac and no, I'm not using games because there's no such thing

57:10.440 --> 57:12.920
as games on a Mac.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.700
So what did you buy the Mac for, angry one?

57:15.700 --> 57:17.040
I bought it because of change.

57:17.040 --> 57:18.840
And no, Loki, don't tell me.

57:18.840 --> 57:20.640
Don't pick up that pitchfork.

57:20.640 --> 57:21.640
He'll be OK.

57:21.640 --> 57:22.640
No, no, no.

57:22.640 --> 57:23.640
I'm not switching.

57:23.640 --> 57:24.640
No.

57:24.640 --> 57:25.640
All right.

57:25.640 --> 57:26.640
All right.

57:26.640 --> 57:27.640
Thanks for the call, Ravenstauven.

57:27.640 --> 57:28.640
Take care, buddy.

57:28.640 --> 57:29.640
You too.

57:29.640 --> 57:30.640
Bye.

57:30.640 --> 57:31.640
Bye bye.

57:31.640 --> 57:32.640
All right.

57:32.640 --> 57:36.960
By the way, Maury, our emailer of the week, sent me a private message in chat.

57:36.960 --> 57:40.080
Maury says, just for clarification, I'm in public school.

57:40.080 --> 57:44.840
Ah, well then, wherever you are, congrats to your public school system.

57:44.840 --> 57:49.080
And your English teacher's mad props for me.

57:49.080 --> 57:51.020
And mad props to you for paying attention.

57:51.020 --> 57:53.460
I want to show you this on air real quick because there's not a lot of calls coming

57:53.460 --> 57:54.460
in right now.

57:54.460 --> 57:55.460
So we want more calls.

57:55.460 --> 57:56.460
But look at this.

57:56.460 --> 57:57.460
Somebody just sent me the link for this in chat.

57:57.460 --> 57:59.520
This is actually what they're doing at E3.

57:59.520 --> 58:02.040
And you can see that Scott is on.

58:02.040 --> 58:03.040
I can see your arm.

58:03.040 --> 58:04.040
I'm sorry.

58:04.040 --> 58:07.360
You can see Scott is on live right now playing Texas Hold'em.

58:07.360 --> 58:11.040
Although I think he must have it hooked into his TV or something.

58:11.040 --> 58:15.760
He's filing a complaint against somebody right now on Xbox Live.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.320
Isn't that weird?

58:17.320 --> 58:19.320
That's pretty cool.

58:19.320 --> 58:21.440
It's like reality TV gone crazy.

58:21.440 --> 58:24.320
SSJ100Matt says link or I shut the fuck up.

58:24.320 --> 58:29.320
My god, I'd love to do this with my cat while I'm, you know, waiting for the day.

58:29.320 --> 58:32.800
Normally at work, you know, the cat stays in the bedroom.

58:32.800 --> 58:36.360
I should put a camera up on the wall or something.

58:36.360 --> 58:39.520
I tried to say hi from OLR in the chat room, but it wouldn't let me because I didn't have

58:39.520 --> 58:40.520
a nickname.

58:40.520 --> 58:41.520
Forget it.

58:41.520 --> 58:44.600
Somebody else, if you're watching that whole thing, tell them we just played that live

58:44.600 --> 58:45.600
on air.

58:45.600 --> 58:46.600
All right.

58:46.600 --> 58:47.600
Let's go take some more calls.

58:47.600 --> 58:48.600
Hello.

58:48.600 --> 58:49.840
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

58:49.840 --> 58:50.840
Who's this?

58:50.840 --> 58:51.840
It's Legend of Zaku.

58:51.840 --> 58:52.840
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

58:52.840 --> 58:54.840
What's on your mind?

58:54.840 --> 58:57.240
Nah, just trying to get through.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.240
That's all.

58:58.240 --> 58:59.240
Yeah.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.240
I just came back from anime next.

59:00.240 --> 59:02.040
How was anime next?

59:02.040 --> 59:03.040
It was all right, though.

59:03.040 --> 59:08.920
I mean, I know I was rooming with Ramen, so it was even better.

59:08.920 --> 59:09.920
Yeah.

59:09.920 --> 59:15.080
Since I think he's not here right now, he's supposed to be calling you to give you the

59:15.080 --> 59:16.080
scoop on everything else.

59:16.080 --> 59:17.080
Actually, wait.

59:17.080 --> 59:18.080
Hold on.

59:18.080 --> 59:19.080
Hold on.

59:19.080 --> 59:20.080
Hello?

59:20.080 --> 59:21.080
Hey, what's up?

59:21.080 --> 59:23.760
Oh, I put Zaku on hold because I saw you calling in on the back line.

59:23.760 --> 59:24.760
Can I conference?

59:24.760 --> 59:25.760
How do I conference?

59:25.760 --> 59:26.760
Shit.

59:26.760 --> 59:27.760
Shut up, Ram.

59:27.760 --> 59:28.760
Hold on.

59:28.760 --> 59:29.760
Let me see.

59:29.760 --> 59:30.760
This might put you on hold.

59:30.760 --> 59:31.760
Cool.

59:31.760 --> 59:33.760
Zaku, you still there?

59:33.760 --> 59:34.760
Yeah.

59:34.760 --> 59:35.760
Okay.

59:35.760 --> 59:36.760
Ramen's actually on the other line.

59:36.760 --> 59:37.760
We just had to put him on hold.

59:37.760 --> 59:38.760
God damn it.

59:38.760 --> 59:39.760
How do we conference?

59:39.760 --> 59:40.760
Oh, wait.

59:40.760 --> 59:42.320
There's a button that says conference.

59:42.320 --> 59:47.360
Showing current call to another call.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.520
This is live radio, boys and girls.

59:49.520 --> 59:50.520
Okay.

59:50.520 --> 59:51.520
Hello?

59:51.520 --> 59:52.520
Yeah.

59:52.520 --> 59:53.520
No.

59:53.520 --> 59:55.360
I'm conferencing with you.

59:55.360 --> 59:56.360
Hold on.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.360
We're going to call you right back.

59:57.360 --> 59:58.360
All right.

59:58.360 --> 59:59.360
Live radio, boys and girls.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.360
Hi.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.360
You still there, Ramen?

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.360
Hello?

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.160
I fucked it all up.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.160
Ramen!

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.160
Ramen!

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.160
Ramen!

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.160
Ramen!

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160
Ramen!

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:20.000
Now I just lost our entire anime next report.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Let's just call Zaku back.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Hi.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.840
All right.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.840
It didn't work.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.840
So whatever.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.520
Just give us your report and then we'll hold Ramen calls back.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.520
What's on your mind?

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.520
Yeah.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.640
Basically, between an agreement between me and him, I'm covering the gaming aspect of

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.640
it.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.600
So far, their gaming room.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.480
I mean, it has the usual stuff, Halo, Dirt Strike.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:50.720
They added stuff like Guitar Hero and the inevitable 2DX setup, which was mediocre at

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.720
best.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.720
Yeah, but that's about it.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.400
They had tournaments on certain games, like Smash Brothers.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.120
Was there any new stuff in the game room, stuff you hadn't seen before?

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.720
Only the Guitar Hero, from what I heard, since they replaced the DDR setup with that.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.640
They used the 360 version.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640
Oh, interesting.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.640
Okay.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.840
And so they held tournaments on that and Gears of War.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:21.200
But besides that, they were also selling a lot of imports in the dealer's room within

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.200
the convention hall.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.680
So I managed to snag a copy of Fifth Style for like 40 bucks.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.680
Very cool.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:31.760
What about any gaming paraphernalia, for lack of a better word, like this ball-fire figure

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.160
came from something like that?

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.200
Yeah, they were all in the dealer room.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.400
There was a lot of cosplayers, you know, dressing up as Mario and other video game characters.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.600
But yeah, most of the good merchandise.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.760
I bet you didn't see someone dressed up as a Wii remote.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.400
Oh, actually, close.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.080
An actual Wii, with the other person holding the Wii mode behind them.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.440
Jonas, I think someone stole your idea.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.680
So wait, they cosplayed as an actual Wii system without the Wii remote?

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.680
Yes.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.040
No, an actual Wii system, and then this other person was holding the Wii mode for him.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.000
I heard rumors that that showed up in SAC Anime in January.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.800
If that is the case, I might see him on SAC Anime in July.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.800
Which is quite exciting.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.480
You're talking about an East Coast thing.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.480
I don't know.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.280
Who the hell would come to SAC for an anime convention if you don't live here, or the

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280
Bay Area, maybe.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.360
Yeah, you're talking about something that happened in Jersey, not Sacramento.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.640
All right, well, all right, look.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.480
Now stop the whole bi-coastal thing.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.280
Zaku, anything else you want to share on the game room?

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.880
That's pretty much about it.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:40.120
The only thing I can say that really pissed me off was just the fact that it was too small

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.640
and they were just controlling crowds.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.640
Basically it had a forum.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.120
It was basically almost like a night club where they just had people just waiting there

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:53.440
in line, you know, since the game room was packed most of the time anyways.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.440
So yeah.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:03:00.320
All right, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go so we can go to Rama and get his

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.200
side of the story on what's going on.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.560
Anything else you want to say about the con real quick?

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.560
It was all right.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.880
I mean, it's my first con, so I really don't have that much to say.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.120
All I need to know is that I need to go to more conventions.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.760
But you want to go to more cons now?

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.440
Yeah, I guess I got a plan for next year.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440
Oh, it's a con.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440
Well, I guess that's a good sign.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.440
All right, who knows?

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.440
I may come in.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.720
I should have planned earlier.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.120
I'm hoping next year I'll be able to afford an East Coast con, so we'll see.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120
All right.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120
All right, later, Zaku.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120
All right, later.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:35.200
And of course, now that I'm finished with Zaku, Rama is nowhere to be seen.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.360
I should be able to call him back, though.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.800
He's somewhere in the history, right?

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.120
Damn it.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.940
Live radio, boys and girls.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.320
I guess not.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.560
We'll take another call real quick.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.400
Who's this?

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.400
Hey, guys.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.400
This is Footy Monster from Argentina.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.760
Hey, Footy Monster.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.760
What's on your mind?

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.560
We're waiting for Rama to call back, but he never did, so we're taking another call in

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560
the meantime.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.560
So what's on your mind?

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.320
All right, then I'll make it fat just in case he calls back.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320
It's all good.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.320
Take your time.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.320
I'll let you know if we see him.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.640
All right, then.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.800
Just two things I wanted to point out.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.740
One thing is that, well, picked up, quote unquote, kind of illegally, Nervous Breakdown

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.500
for DS, which is an Arkanoid Breakout clone.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.500
That sounds like fun.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.400
And it is really good.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.440
It's a game you wouldn't pay two cents for, but it's actually really, really good.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.920
It starts off as a normal Breakout game, but really quick, it begins to have different

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.160
skins and different gimmicks to the game.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.060
Instead of having one paddle, you have one on the bottom screen and one on the top screen,

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:41.480
and you've got to make sure that you don't flumb with the ball in the middle.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.800
You might have a ball that starts going faster and faster, which is second, or you might

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.080
need to blow into the screen to have the ball go up a little bit all the time instead of

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.160
keep going down, because sometimes you're on a scrolling screen, and you're always going

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.160
up.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.360
It's like you die and stuff like that.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.120
It's really weird, but it's actually pretty fun.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.440
How do you control that with the stylus?

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.440
All with the stylus.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.440
There's no buttons whatsoever.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.400
Do you drag the paddle around?

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.560
Yeah, you drag the paddle around.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.480
Sometimes you've got to drag just left and right.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.040
Sometimes you can drag across the whole screen, so you can actually move it up and down, too.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:16.040
And there's this level where you actually have to draw your own paddle, so you can draw

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.560
it in any shape you want.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.880
That sounds pretty cool.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.880
I know.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:24.680
There's a team of 10 people that made it, and it's like 20 bucks or something like that,

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:29.840
so I'm definitely going to try to pick it up next week when I go to Toronto.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.720
But yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know, I know there are some people that like that

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:39.400
kind of game on All Art, and maybe you, Sky, because you like puzzle games, but that's

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.920
a pretty good game, so you might want to try it out.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.920
Absolutely.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.040
I want this game, because I was a big Arkanoid fan.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:51.000
Actually, there's a little part where you're basically controlling a ship instead of having

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
just a paddle.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.480
It's a ship that shoots lasers, so you can actually shoot lasers and destroy obstacles

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.880
on the screen and stuff like that while you're bouncing the ball around.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.880
Do you get to fight dough?

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.760
What was that, sorry?

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.360
Do you get to fight dough?

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.360
Yeah.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.700
All right.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:12.320
Real quickly, before I let you go, anything you're looking forward to at E3 this week?

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.320
Yeah.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:18.080
Actually, I'm looking forward to everything RPG-related for obvious reasons, and I'm really

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.240
curious to see if Sega is going to announce anything related to Shenmue, like at all,

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.880
even Shenmue Online, anything.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:27.680
But it's just hopeful to me that I know it will not happen, but I have to keep wondering

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.520
about it, because they robbed me from my Shenmue 3, so hey, you know.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:37.380
I would say you have about as much chance of seeing Shenmue 3 as you do the public apology

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:38.380
for Sonic.

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.320
Yeah, Shenmue 2 sort of bombed, didn't it?

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:46.680
The first one was really good, especially playing Space Harrier.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.680
That was my first Shenmue.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.580
We probably shouldn't be getting to this, because I'm such a big fanboy that I could

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.360
talk for hours about the game, so just saying that.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.600
One last thing, I think next weekend there's going to be a fighting game tournament in

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:04.960
Toronto in York University, so if you are interested, I think it's like five bucks or

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:05.960
ten bucks to get in.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.920
It's like three days, and it's going to be crazy full of people, so I'm going to try

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.040
to, since I might fly, arrive on Saturday, I'm going to try to go straight there.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.640
Well, give us a call and let us know how it goes.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:21.040
If I actually want to do anything, I'll call in, you know, next Sunday.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040
Alright, sounds good.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.360
Thanks so much for the call, Footy Monster.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.360
Take care.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.360
Okay, you guys too.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.360
Alright, bye-bye.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360
Bye.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.880
Alright, I think we have Rama calling back now.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.040
Hi, you're on Orange Onions Radio, who's this?

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.200
Hello, you're on Orange Onions Radio, who's this?

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.200
It's Harvey.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.580
Apparently the volume went away.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.560
If you can hear me, we can't hear you.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.160
Something happened to your phone.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.880
That totally is Rama trying to call us back, too.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.880
Son of a gun.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.560
Ron, Ron.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.560
I don't know what's wrong.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.200
I wanted to hear the report, too, from a vet.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.200
Oh my God.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:03.440
SSG100, Matt, you're suddenly my hero for saying Admiral Ackbar's cereal is greater

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.700
than Night Trap 2.

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:11.840
We watched that, Rob, before you showed up at the 4th of July party.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.400
We watched the Star Wars robot chicken.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.160
I think you guys were watching some of that.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.160
No, we were watching My Name is Earl when you were over.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.540
That show was great.

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.800
You had a great 4th of July party, except for my killer headache, but that wasn't your

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.800
party's fault.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.800
You want to know what, Rob?

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.800
What?

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.160
I had a headache the entire time myself, and I ended up having to sleep with an ice pack

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.160
on my head.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.240
Oh, that's horrible.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.320
I was in migraine hell the entire time.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.080
The sad thing is that I live there, so I couldn't leave.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:43.000
Thankfully, my boyfriend's really good friend is a physician's assistant, so we always call

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.360
him for drug advice, like, what should I be taking, because I have a killer headache,

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.360
and it worked.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.120
All right, I don't see Rama calling back, so at least we'll go to another call.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.120
Hi, you're on Orange Honors Radio.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.120
Who's this?

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.120
Hey, Rob.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.480
Able to think from the forum, so you can mute my thing.

01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.480
Hello.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.480
Able to think.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.880
Are you a first-time caller?

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.560
Yeah, I am.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.840
Well, welcome to the show.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.840
What's on your mind?

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.640
Thanks for calling.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:19.880
That psycho lady from Australia who decided to try to abduct, well, technically abduct

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.800
the kids from whatever state that was.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.360
That was kind of gross.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.080
Yeah, what is up with that?

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.400
What did you want to say about that?

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.820
I mean, does that just not make you feel good in your tummy?

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:35.000
Does it make you sick?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.520
It makes me want to go grab a shotgun, and hopefully...

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.080
Well, now, wait a minute, careful what you say on an internet radio program.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.480
You need to be shot with happy lasers.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480
Yes, that's right.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.440
You want to shoot with flowers and rose petals.

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440
Bunch of flowers.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.320
Seriously, if a lady like that came to my door, I'd probably freak.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:59.400
Well, but the thing that pisses me off about it is that it gives World of Warcraft a bad

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.480
name because nobody stops to think that, oh, this is just some crazy bitch.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.120
But they go, oh, well, they met on World of Warcraft, so obviously all the crazies are

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.320
on World of Warcraft, which is somewhat true.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.960
There are a lot of crazies on World of Warcraft, but we're not all crazy.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.680
What's that, buddy?

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:24.440
I think you mean video games in general because that seems to be whatever everybody thinks.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.660
Whenever anything goes wrong with society, it's all video games' fault.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.660
That's true.

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.660
That happens.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:35.480
And our crazy psycho lawyer friend whose name we must not mention.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.480
That's absolutely right.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480
I know.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.480
It's just, ugh.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.480
Drives us nuts.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.440
Well, what are you looking forward to at E3 next week?

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:50.160
Okay, I want to see if Nintendo announces a Wii hard drive.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.280
A Wii hard drive?

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.400
What the hell would they use it for?

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.480
Virtual console games, and if they have an Xbox Live service coming on, then they're

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:10.520
going to need to get it so you can have more space or else you're not going to be able

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.720
to fit all your games on there.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.200
How about they use the SD memory card slot that they have on there and don't seem to

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.200
use for anything?

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:24.000
Yeah, well, that would help too, but still, you have to go buy lots of SD cards, a hard

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.160
drive, or just be a single purchase.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:32.560
I'm sure they'll use it for all that download content that's available on Wii Connect 24.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.800
I know my flash drive is teaming with tons and tons and tons and tons of content, so

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.240
much so that I don't get around to playing any of it.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.600
Well, I mean, who knows?

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.080
The Magic 8-Ball says not bloody likely on that, but who knew that Nintendo would put

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.880
out a two-screen system with a touchscreen?

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:59.280
Oh, and on two.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.280
I have an FU.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.160
Is that okay if I F you something?

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.160
Really quick, sure.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.920
F you to spin markers because they cheat.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.840
I can't spin my finger.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:13.080
So you're giving an FU an oh and on two.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.120
What's the problem with the spin markers?

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.280
Okay, they cheat.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.280
It's like a nice lady.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:24.320
She has to get their sweet spot or else it doesn't work.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.200
Very well put, my friend.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.200
Very well put.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.200
All right, we've got to let you go, though, buddy.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.560
Thanks so much for the call, but we're going to try and get Rama one more time here, and

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.320
we'll talk to you again, okay?

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.320
See you.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.920
All right, thanks for the call.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.920
We like hearing from noobs.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.000
It's always good to hear from new people.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Ah, damn it.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.600
Just as I went to the tab that Rama's call, he dropped.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.600
Ah.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.840
Oh, there he is again.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.560
Let's try to get him.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.560
One more time.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.560
This is Rama.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.560
Who's this?

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.560
This is Rama.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.560
Can you hear me now?

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.560
Thank God.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:54.560
Yes, we can.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.560
We can hear you.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.560
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.560
Please.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.560
This better be good.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.280
All right, now I'm going with my anime mixed con report, and I'll tell you this right now.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.240
For a local con, it was pretty much off the walls.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.240
Really?

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.240
That's a glowing reveal.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.240
What happened?

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.240
What made this con so freaking great?

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:16.480
Well, one of the main important things about cons is it's just as good as the friends who

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480
were there.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:23.240
When I got there, I knew half the people there getting stuff like, hey, how are you and stuff.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:28.400
The fact that it's like the way that the con is laid out, you have the expo center, like

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.800
six, seven hotels in the area, everybody's just hanging out at the holly in Fort Lorne

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:37.400
or they're hanging out from the expo center, and you go on the inside, you see a lot of

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.960
video game cosplay, which was really awesome in my book.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.560
Was there a lot of gaming content at this con?

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.000
The way Zachar made it sound, it wasn't too much on the gaming.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.840
Well I do know this much, it basically got rid of the DDR room and replaced it with Guitar

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:53.840
Hero.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:58.280
Yeah, I guess you've kind of seen that slowly happening in a lot of cons, and pretty soon

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.640
Rock Band, huh?

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640
Pretty much.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:05.400
I would like it as if what anime had choose to have was they actually had an arcade machine

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.800
in the con itself.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.520
People come up and play it for free, which I thought was pretty cool.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.640
Hey, Rama, the chat wants to know, are you calling in from a TARDIS?

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:20.800
No, it's called Sprint Network.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.600
You just sound like you're in a box somewhere, it's kind of funny, that's alright.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.360
Well, Rama, how about the anime side of things?

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.200
I know you're a big anime fan, how was that represented?

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.200
Was there a lot of stuff to do and see and good guests and stuff?

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200
Definitely.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:39.640
I was able to interview a couple of voice actors, Chris Patton and Monica Rial.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.280
They both worked for ABB and Funimation.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.680
One thing I've noticed with a lot of cons nowadays, it's not about what's going on now,

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.000
but what's very popular in Japan.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.800
And the biggest thing is always Final Fantasy, which is a gig, but that's starting to kind

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.280
of dwindle down.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.880
Now you see a lot of more stuff that's coming out, I saw a lot of Lucky Star, Cosplay, I

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:06.280
think some SMA would be still somewhat popular.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.280
Interesting, huh?

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.280
Very cool.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.280
Very.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.280
Anything else?

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:14.280
Any funny, funny things happen to the con you want to share with us, especially funny

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.280
moments?

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:23.520
Well, I was at the dead dog, which is the staff party, and the Las Vegas rule was put

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.520
in effect.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.960
So I really can't tell you about that, but I can say this, most of my funny experiences

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.960
is that running into people that I know, and I'm like, do I know you?

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:39.240
Oh, now I know who you are, different costume, different makeup, and it's like, ah, I see.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.440
Well, what happens at Anime Cons stays at Anime Cons, huh?

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.560
Definitely, especially when you're taking shots with Silco.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.840
Well, all right, don't have too much fun over there, okay?

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.360
I don't want to be left, I was on my way back when I was trying to call.

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360
What?

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.680
I'm sorry?

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.840
I was on my way back from the party when I was trying to call.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.560
Ah, well, maybe that explains some of the difficulty we had earlier.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.240
All right, Rama, we're going to let you go so we wrap up the show, but thanks so much

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.240
for calling and giving us your report, okay?

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.240
No problem.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.240
Thank you.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.240
All right, later.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.920
He really does sound like he was calling in from inside a cardboard box.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:18.360
We can do one more call here real quick, and then we're going to call it a night.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.600
Who's this?

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.600
Hello?

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.600
Hi, who's this?

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.160
You're on Orange Lawn Radio.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.160
This is Sinan from Finland.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.560
Oh, wow.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.520
We love getting listeners from far away.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.040
What's on your mind, my Finnish friend?

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:39.440
I don't really have all that much in mind, I think, because it's early in the morning

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.440
over here.

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.440
I know.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.000
You've been staying up very late to listen to us live.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.360
We appreciate it.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:50.240
Well, I was off to work at the beginning, but I've been here one hour now, I think.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.240
Oh, very cool.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.320
Has there been a topic tonight that you wanted to chime in on?

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.320
Something that...

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.320
No.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.320
Not really.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.000
While at work, I listen to the five...

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.920
What the fuck is this sound I'm hearing?

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.960
It's Rob being silly.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.480
I think you're hearing us echoing.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.480
It's okay.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:16.000
All right, I don't think we've had someone call in just to say, hey.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.480
It's really because I listen to the five-year anniversary show, and I thought I would just

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.480
drop in a line.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.320
After all, I got back from work, and I thought that maybe I could call in now and never again

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.000
listen live.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.120
Did you enjoy the five-year anniversary show?

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.120
Yeah, I did.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:40.480
I've been listening to this show for about one year now, but this is the first time I'm

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:42.560
listening live, so I thought I would call in.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560
All right.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.640
Well, welcome to the live experience, and thanks for letting us know that there's folks

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.680
all around the world that listen to us.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.320
Hey, is E3 big news over there as well?

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.240
Are you guys looking forward to the big E3 show here in the States?

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.880
Yeah, of course.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.800
It's always, except for now, isn't it smaller nowadays?

01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.800
Well, a little bit.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.680
I mean, but it's still all the same news.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.160
The show itself might be small, but the news, I believe, is still going to stay the same.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.320
Is there anything that you hope will happen at this year's E3?

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.520
I hope there will be some good information about Fallout 3, because that's a game I'm

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:15.520
very interested in.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.120
Ah, Fallout 3.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.920
What is it about Fallout 3?

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.320
Were you a fan of the first two games, or have you just seen the screenshots?

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320
Are you excited?

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.420
What is it about Fallout that you love?

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:29.600
I'm a huge Fallout fan, which means that Fallout 3 I'm pretty scared about, I think, is going

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.600
to be shit.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.960
Why do you think that Fallout 3 is going to be shit?

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.960
It's going to be Oblivion with guns.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.960
Oblivion with guns.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.840
But Oblivion is a freaking great game.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:44.920
But I guess, you know, maybe that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to translate well

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.440
into a series like Fallout.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.440
No, I don't think so.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.720
And I don't really like Oblivion either.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.720
You don't like Oblivion?

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:52.960
No, of course not.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.800
What were you playing it on?

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.800
What system?

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.440
Oh, I haven't been playing it.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.840
That's why I don't like it.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:06.200
I'm sorry, I'm thinking of a different game.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.200
It's alright.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.840
It's getting late over here, too.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.680
Alright, well, anything else you wanted to share with us quickly tonight before we let

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:17.560
you go?

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560
Not really, I don't think so.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.840
Alright, well, that's alright, thanks so much for calling, it was certainly an entertaining

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.480
call, we appreciate it, okay?

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.480
I hope so.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:25.480
Alright.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.480
Let's watch some other shows and look at our time.

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.480
Alright, sounds good.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:32.400
And we know you have to stay up late to listen live, so we appreciate that true fandom over

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.920
there overseas, on the other side of the pond.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.480
Yeah, two ponds.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.280
Alright, oh yeah, that's right.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.800
It was just a hop, skip, and a jump, and an 18 hour flight, right?

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.800
Alright, take care, buddy.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.800
Yep, take care.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.800
Later.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.800
Bye.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.800
Later.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.680
That's great.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.680
Not only was he, you know, he was from another country, which was kind of cool, but he just

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.840
kind of called to say, hey, what's up?

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:55.840
That was cool.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.840
What's up?

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.840
How's it going?

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:01.240
That was rad.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.120
That was a very fitting call for tonight, I think.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.120
That really were.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.740
Alright, unfortunately, I know there's still folks trying to call in, but we got to wrap

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:14.680
it up and get the show done and move on to our, you know, very uninteresting lives.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.960
So we're going to now ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960
I think I have a few things.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.800
Well, yes, sir.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.800
Uh oh.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.560
There's rumors going around that Rock Band may be an Xbox 360 timed exclusive game.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:34.920
The reason being is because the invitation to their Rock Band E3 presentation had the

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:41.160
Xbox 360 logo on there, but amazingly enough, the PlayStation logo was not on there.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.600
Could it be a mistake?

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.600
I don't know.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:48.940
Although I know from all the videos that we've seen from, I think, the EA event, the game

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:55.280
was being played on an Xbox 360 dev kit, not a PlayStation 3, so we'll find out pretty

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.200
soon, I'm hoping.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:02.840
Other games possibly going to be delayed, Stuntman Ignition, the PlayStation 3 version

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:07.040
is going to be delayed for that, apparently.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:11.760
Most likely going to slide from August to October this year.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.800
So that's kind of interesting.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:20.520
A game called Atari Classics has been spotted for the PSP on Gamefly.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:25.580
In the past, we've noticed that, of course, Gamefly has a lot of titles of stuff that

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:32.680
have leaked, like beautiful Katamari before people notice or before they have the official

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.300
announcement.

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:38.380
Let's see what else here.

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:44.000
There's a rumor also going around that Mario Kart Wii may be coming out this year, but

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
in Europe.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:54.440
The rumor is that the US will be getting Smash Bros. Brawl in 2007 and Mario Kart in 2008,

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:59.680
whereas Europe will be getting the opposite, Mario Kart in 2007 and Smash Bros. in 2008.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.600
What is this, Nintendo's apology to Europe by screwing us over?

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.600
I want fucking Mario Kart.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.800
Fuck this Smash Bros. shit.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.680
You can all wait for Smash Bros.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.760
I want my cake and I'm going to eat it too.

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760
I want those things.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:13.400
I want more Mario Kart.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:20.360
The other one that's interesting is Battalion Wars 2 has been pushed back to October 29th

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:23.040
and that I know is official.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:28.280
What makes that interesting though is there's no Wii game coming out in September.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:33.560
So if you think about it, and this is all speculation, but if you think about it and

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:38.640
they wanted a pretty strong Wii title to compete against Halo 3 and whatnot, that would be

01:22:38.640 --> 01:23:08.040
the perfect prime spot for Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:13.200
Well, I understand you guys wanted to go to E3, I mean, there's always next year.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.320
That's right.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.320
Some other year.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:19.800
That's okay, we're having fun stomping and throwing a fit this year, it's fine.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:23.360
By the way, was it FU's of the week earlier today?

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.360
Missed them.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.080
They were early in the show, sorry to say.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.080
I'm not angsty, so.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.960
Oh, I was going to say you could quickly throw one out as your final thought.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:37.880
Well, the only FU I had was Anime Expo, 07's organization this year, being an unorganized

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:43.920
and having the staff pro-screw it all over for everybody else, especially with the scheduling.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.200
I have not been hearing good things about what went down there.

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:50.760
And of course, everyone heard about the whole petition of trying to move Anime Expo 08 out

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.760
of Los Angeles Convention Center.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.760
Wow.

01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:00.940
Yes, there's been an extreme amount of debates over it, being held unsafe, and how the hotels

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:05.880
are like two blocks away from the M. I say move it back to Disneyland.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:06.880
They love that.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.880
Oh, yeah.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:08.880
Oh, hell no.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.880
That was a nightmare.

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.880
All right.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:11.880
Anyway, thank you very much, Jost.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.560
DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:18.120
I'm going to Disneyland, bitches.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:23.960
My final thought is I want candy very badly, even though I shouldn't be eating more candy,

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:24.960
but I really want candy.

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:25.960
Oh, yeah.

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.280
Don't forget about SacAnime this week.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.280
I won't.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.280
I won't.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.280
Loki, your final thought?

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.720
Last but certainly not least, Loki.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:36.800
I have a kitty named after an Atari emulator.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.240
I didn't name the cat.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.840
Some old woman named the cat.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.680
