00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:24,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, July the 1st of 2007.

3
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:36,187
[SPEAKER_09]: If you haven't heard Part A of our program yet, go back to wherever you got this episode, whether it be iTunes or Dig or wherever you got this, and look for Part A, because Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two parts every week.

4
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:38,948
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the little announce in the beginning of the show told you.

5
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:40,248
[SPEAKER_09]: So why am I repeating myself?

6
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:41,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

7
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,309
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's get back to the gaming news.

8
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:54,111
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an interesting little blog post I've seen pop up on Engadget showing someone that's modded a Wii Remote with a Zapper Gun from the Nintendo Entertainment System.

9
00:00:54,911 --> 00:01:05,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Now what they've done with this, and you might be wondering why the hell would they do this, is they've actually kind of repositioned the IR sensor that's in the front of the Wii Remote to the front of the Zapper Gun.

10
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:09,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course the trigger on the Zapper Gun is now the B button for the Wii Remote.

11
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:12,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Duck Hunt on Virtual Console already?

12
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can really get some use out of this.

13
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:36,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Dokkan's going to be a little harder because a lot of those gun games now, it's not going to be a straight port over.

14
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:38,629
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got to rebuild the whole thing for the Wii Remote.

15
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I guess that's kind of true, huh?

16
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:49,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, can't, I mean, because basically these games run off of emulators anyway, so can't the Wii Remote kind of emulate a light gun in the same way that some Nintendo emulators let you use your mouse?

17
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:55,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose, but, you know, obviously the people that make the emulators aren't exactly the people that work for Nintendo either.

18
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like me some Battle Clash.

19
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:22,976
[SPEAKER_08]: and some SuperScope 6 stuff.

20
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:23,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

21
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:24,577
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

22
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:28,538
[SPEAKER_09]: The Doctor in chat says, I want some awesome 3D duck hunt.

23
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,479
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be kind of interesting.

24
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Shadow Charlie says, but isn't there supposed to be a Zapper adapter coming soon?

25
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:38,842
[SPEAKER_08]: There is something that's officially going to come out at some point pretty soon.

26
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:45,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I would imagine that, you know, because they were showing stuff at E3 last year that looked like a shotgun kind of attachment.

27
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:47,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, that was, you know, more of a prototype.

28
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,206
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we might see something in E3.

29
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:49,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

30
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:52,784
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when they drop bombs like that.

31
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:54,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, this is going to be coming out soon.

32
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:15,118
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

33
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:35,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like Castlevania.

34
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:51,799
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:14,501
[SPEAKER_09]: But certainly this is like a really high, you know, very highly anticipated A-list title, so to speak.

36
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:14,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

37
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:15,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty cool.

38
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,007
[SPEAKER_09]: But not the first time that Konami has gone to the Internet to find musicians.

39
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:27,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, if you follow the DDR series, the Ultramix and Universe series have previously had a competition to put indie artists in the game.

40
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:28,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

41
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:52,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Other thing that people might be looking for, I mean, granted the classic controller is pretty good for fighting games, but, you know, when you're looking for something just a little bit better and a little bit more like the arcade, well, you might be turning to a company like Hori, and they're actually going to be releasing a fighting stick for the Wii, which I imagine would be kind of hooking up to the Wii Remote, very similar to, like, the classic controller.

42
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:56,939
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, this is everything that you could possibly want in an arcade stick, and

43
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:58,303
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks awesome.

44
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:05,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect for Street Fighter 2 Turbo or, of course, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core.

45
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:08,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say all those original Wii fighting games that the Wii doesn't have right now.

46
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they'll have Guilty Gear soon.

47
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:13,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, virtual console stuff, and this will also be good for arcade games and stuff.

48
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:14,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you know what?

49
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:17,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot of people really pick up these arcade sticks.

50
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,541
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the people that really are into their hardcore.

51
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:20,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking hardcore.

52
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,263
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, games like that, so...

53
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I use it backwards compatible with GameCube, like for Soul Calibur action?

54
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:40,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not, because this is going to be hooking up via the expansion port on the Wii Remote, so since you can't use the Wii Remote or Classic Controller on GameCube games, you're out of luck.

55
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:45,800
[SPEAKER_08]: And you probably wouldn't be able to anyways, because there's really only one directional button...

56
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:53,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Directional Joystick on there and eight buttons, so you wouldn't have all the analog sticks and stuff that the GameCube would have.

57
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:55,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well.

58
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:01,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I was just responding to some comments in chat there.

59
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:06,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody who just joined, who hasn't changed their nickname yet, says, why can't the PSP get Contra 4?

60
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't Contra 4 go to the PSP?

61
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:10,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ranma responded, because the PSP sucks ass.

62
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:12,777
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, play FF1.

63
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:21,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't suck ass, but I think that this game would work pretty good on the DS.

64
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:32,212
[SPEAKER_08]: After all, the first three Contra games were on the Nintendo system, so only fitting that Contra 4 come to the DS.

65
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:34,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

66
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:50,874
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

67
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:21,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Radio Esther Nolan's show, and actually said here, "...I thought it was absolutely appalling that a word like this should be used to describe someone who has not achieved very well."

68
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:38,214
[SPEAKER_09]: The three-year-old, by the way, to put this in perspective, her three-year-old suffered from cerebral palsy and was also severely brain damaged.

69
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,935
[SPEAKER_09]: So she was kind of... That's not funny!

70
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just thinking of what the word was.

71
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:45,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the situation.

72
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:46,577
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really sad.

73
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:56,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And the lady was very shocked because she performed poorly in this one stage and the game called her, quote, it rated her efforts in a manner derogatory to the disabled.

74
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:58,503
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm thinking the word is retarded?

75
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:02,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, which, you know, is a word.

76
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll admit, we do it here on the program.

77
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:08,923
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of, you know, we throw that word around sometimes and not really think about what it really means.

78
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:20,850
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, you have to understand that we, I mean, the word retard means to slow or, you know, to, I guess, I don't know, basically slow, you know, retarding something.

79
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,252
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, retard your anger, you know.

80
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:26,253
[SPEAKER_08]: That was in anger management.

81
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:26,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

82
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:31,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to tell the Loki next time the subject of Apple comes up.

83
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Retard your anger.

84
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,782
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but seriously, that's how you... In music, you use that term.

85
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,263
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you use the word.

86
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:39,064
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unfortunate.

87
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:40,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, you know, what is it?

88
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:41,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Fag.

89
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:52,234
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people... It isn't, you know, to describe a cigarette and stuff, but it's, you know, slang in the UK, but over here, you know, we use it as, you know, what I get called.

90
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

91
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:55,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Fag your anger, Rob.

92
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,739
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:29,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I think mine was by Ubisoft, so shame on them.

94
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:30,860
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think, Rice Princess?

95
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:32,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have an opinion on this?

96
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:37,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you haven't really been talking the rest of the show otherwise, so I'm trying to encourage you to participate.

97
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:39,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm totally looking at my life journal.

98
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:42,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

99
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,117
[SPEAKER_10]: It really depends on what the word actually is.

100
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:46,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think that they should have included that in the article.

101
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:52,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, it could be something like, you know, I don't know, farty butt or something, you know, being the actual word.

102
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:53,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never heard of farty butt.

103
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:54,744
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so dumb.

104
00:09:56,025 --> 00:10:00,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of farty butt be used for a derogatory term that is disabled.

105
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:05,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally think it's the word Cali from Battlestar Galactica.

106
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:09,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Knight says it's the French Ubisoft

107
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:38,612
[SPEAKER_09]: GirlBakura says, something with the word spastic.

108
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:42,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe like a spaz, or I don't know, maybe could be the word there.

109
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:43,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

110
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:48,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Azurame says, I think she is right.

111
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:52,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I work in the mental field, and they could get in some serious trouble if told to the right people.

112
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma also says, whatever happens, sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.

113
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:58,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

114
00:10:59,044 --> 00:10:59,584
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

115
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:01,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Sigh.

116
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:05,379
[SPEAKER_09]: and ACHP says the word was spastic.

117
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Is spastic really that bad?

118
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Have I just been ignorant all these years?

119
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Ignant?

120
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:15,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you so ignorant?

121
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:16,421
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

122
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Spastic I don't think is a bad term.

123
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:21,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

124
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:23,762
[SPEAKER_09]: That's stupid.

125
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:25,403
[SPEAKER_09]: She's spastic.

126
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:26,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking spaz.

127
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:36,653
[SPEAKER_09]: This frustration leaves me with no other choice but to bring on one of our very favorite segments because I'm just left confused and unsure with what else to do at this point.

128
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:49,318
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the F-U's of the week time.

129
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:54,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And just before we get started, AZHP says that spastic is a bad word in the UK but not in America.

130
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of like how fag...

131
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:56,964
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

132
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:17,548
[SPEAKER_08]: It was nice to see that they've repaved the freeway.

133
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:21,591
[SPEAKER_08]: The only problem is they forgot to paint lines on the freeway.

134
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:27,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's this four-lane highway that all of a sudden becomes one lane because there's no lines on it!

135
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:30,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes it a little unsafe.

136
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:32,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a little, you know.

137
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially when cars are like, well, I don't know where the lane ends, so... That's kind of bad.

138
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:40,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of something you should have, I don't know...

139
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:43,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Done before you finish your project here.

140
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,212
[SPEAKER_08]: At least put something that indicates where the lane ends and begins.

141
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:50,976
[SPEAKER_08]: So, fuck them, because I know someone's going to get injured and hopefully sue for a lot of money.

142
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:53,137
[SPEAKER_09]: My F.U.

143
00:12:53,197 --> 00:13:02,124
[SPEAKER_09]: of the week goes to the fact that I just put in my notice I'm going to move on August 1st today, and I have no place to live lined up just yet, so I'll be hitting Craigslist all next week.

144
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:07,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Or it might be OLR, Live From Your House, a contest from the listeners, because I'll be homeless.

145
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:08,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

146
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:09,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty fat.

147
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:09,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

148
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Rice for toast.

149
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:14,217
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to the weather because it's way too fucking hot.

150
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:16,678
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't have an air conditioner in my car.

151
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:17,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm Poe.

152
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,321
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't afford a luxury car.

153
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:23,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty much it.

154
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry too.

155
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, what are you giggling at over there, Loki?

156
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:30,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Shadows liar.

157
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:33,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Fag your anger, Loki.

158
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:42,120
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody hasn't left a review on iTunes... Oh, damn it, they're going to block that word.

159
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,262
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to be able to put fag in a review on iTunes.

160
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:47,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, because I was going to say... Oh, that's retarded.

161
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:50,487
[SPEAKER_09]: That's horrible.

162
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:53,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize if you were offended by that and the fact that I laughed at it.

163
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:56,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, whatever, that's your automatic gut reaction.

164
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:59,694
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to apologize for who you are, Rob.

165
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:05,238
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really want to see a review on iTunes that says, these guys need to learn how to fag their anger.

166
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:07,792
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be brilliant.

167
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:08,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Can someone make that happen?

168
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:11,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Get around the word censor somehow.

169
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:13,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Put P-H-A-G or something.

170
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:19,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you the link in iTunes if you want to go leave a review there for our chatters, because I'm sure there's someone in there that hasn't done it.

171
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Good idea.

172
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there you go.

173
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,803
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sickester, Insanist, in the chat says, F-H-A-G, Fag Your Anger.

174
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want someone in the chat to leave that as an iTunes review.

175
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:31,047
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys need to learn how to fag their anger.

176
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good times.

177
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:34,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways...

178
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:37,402
[SPEAKER_08]: So, guess what?

179
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:45,046
[SPEAKER_08]: There's this brand new, well, it's not brand new, but a racing series coming back to consoles exclusively to the Wii.

180
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:58,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Cruisin', and it's going to be exclusively coming to the Wii with licensed cars and whatnot, body kits, upgrades, turbos, all that fun stuff.

181
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:02,917
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Cruisin', coming to the Wii.

182
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:07,053
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, to be honest, I never was a huge fan of the Cruisin' series.

183
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I always thought them to be kind of cheesy and stupid.

184
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:16,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I seem to remember DarkSakura as a big fan, though, so she'll probably be excited about this.

185
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:18,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I played the games.

186
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:18,937
[SPEAKER_08]: They were pretty fun.

187
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:20,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Did anyone remember Rush?

188
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:21,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

189
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:23,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Rush 2049, San Francisco Rush?

190
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:29,920
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I meant the last Rush game that they released that was basically... I don't remember if it was Rush.

191
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was just San Francisco Rush, but they redid it.

192
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:35,078
[SPEAKER_08]: for the PSP and stuff.

193
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:36,439
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't very good.

194
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:38,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

195
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,821
[SPEAKER_08]: So you think this game might be a disaster as well?

196
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:42,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might be.

197
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:46,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Just what we needed in this next gen of gaming or new gen of gaming, whatever you want to call it.

198
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Another fucking racing game.

199
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:48,684
[SPEAKER_08]: That sucks.

200
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:52,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it is a memorable one from the years past.

201
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:54,307
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

202
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,386
[SPEAKER_09]: which was a TurboGrafx game there.

203
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:20,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Bloody Wolf?

204
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,949
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's like a war-ish game there on the TurboGrafx-16.

205
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:26,092
[SPEAKER_09]: So you get cutesy cutesy Kirby and Bloody Wolf.

206
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,113
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

207
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:28,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Kirby's Bloody Wolf.

208
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,156
[SPEAKER_09]: What came out in America?

209
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:31,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally missed it.

210
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:33,518
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the F-Zero, didn't we?

211
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:34,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

212
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:34,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

213
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:38,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't downloaded anything from Virtual Console since Zelda 2.

214
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:39,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that just two weeks ago?

215
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:40,564
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't that long ago.

216
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:42,826
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like a long time ago.

217
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:43,367
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

218
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, some other stuff you're going to be able to download soon.

219
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,613
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know why this is a news story, because I always thought this was still on there in the first place.

220
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:58,857
[SPEAKER_08]: But also a reminder, if you haven't downloaded the internet channel yet, you're now going to have to pay for it.

221
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,818
[SPEAKER_08]: So screw you guys.

222
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:01,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that it's any good.

223
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:07,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that we don't have an OLOB site, because I never made one.

224
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:08,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you're lazy.

225
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:09,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm lazy.

226
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:14,912
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, there's going to be a brand new service coming to have original downloadable tiles called WiiWare.

227
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:23,720
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I remember correctly, that's already online with, I think, the internet channel and also the Wii Vote channel.

228
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,881
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called WiiWare.

229
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:27,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And hypothetically, there's Dr. Mario Wii, right?

230
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:29,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hypothetically.

231
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:29,926
[SPEAKER_09]: 2 plus 2 equals 4.

232
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:35,050
[SPEAKER_08]: This, I'm not sure if it's going to be a brand new channel, but currently online right now, they do have a section for WiiWare.

233
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been there.

234
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:45,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Forever, but they just want you to remember that there is going to be a WiiWare service that's going to be kind of like Xbox Live Arcade or the PlayStation 3 PSN Network.

235
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:47,523
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

236
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:55,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to be seeing some original titles, which will be cool, and I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to find out what exactly is coming there first.

237
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we're thinking Dr. Mario Wii.

238
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:02,349
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't checked the Everybody Votes channel in weeks.

239
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:04,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they ever use the question I submitted to them?

240
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

241
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:07,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Last one I saw was thank you or hello.

242
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,960
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the question I submitted was which is funnier, clowns or rape?

243
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they use that, though.

244
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:17,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking they probably didn't because I probably would have heard something about it.

245
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:19,482
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably would have made the gaming blog news.

246
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:30,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Also making the gaming blog news this week is the launch of Three Speech because everybody and their fucking mom has to have a podcast.

247
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:32,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And so Sony started one.

248
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:34,427
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the Three Speech podcast.

249
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And what did they do in their first podcast?

250
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:42,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It might not have been the first episode, but definitely they're still early on in their podcasting life.

251
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:44,259
[SPEAKER_09]: They've taken a shot at Major Nelson.

252
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:57,127
[SPEAKER_09]: What's interesting, though, is that upon reviews of the new Three Speech podcast, Three Speech doesn't really let you know that they work for Sony, where Major Nelson kind of makes it no secret he does work for Microsoft.

253
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:02,670
[SPEAKER_09]: But the interesting thing about Major Nelson, he'll say nice things about the Wii once in a while, and even PlayStation 3 if they deserve it.

254
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,411
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

255
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,599
[SPEAKER_09]: and, sorry, I laughed because I'm reading chat here.

256
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,942
[SPEAKER_09]: WonderDogHerald suggests everybody votes question, which do you prefer, cock or vag?

257
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:17,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm sure that'll get through.

258
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:19,965
[SPEAKER_09]: They're dinner meats.

259
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:21,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

260
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:23,907
What the hell?

261
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:25,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they're dinner meats.

262
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:28,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Great way to cover that up there.

263
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:29,454
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

264
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:30,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget the other story.

265
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:33,875
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a story about Sony making fun of Major Nelson.

266
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:34,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

267
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:35,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, who cares?

268
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:36,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Boo-hoo.

269
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm seriously reading this going, who cares?

270
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:40,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo-hoo.

271
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:44,517
[SPEAKER_09]: They refer to Major Nelson as the unnamed blogger.

272
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

273
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:46,598
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

274
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do they say he's unnamed?

275
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:49,919
[SPEAKER_08]: He clearly has a name!

276
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:51,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Major Nelson!

277
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:55,380
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just pure falsity.

278
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

279
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,283
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, I made up a word, falsity.

280
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:01,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really care.

281
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:06,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I've listened to Major Nelson once, not that I have anything against the guy, I just don't have time to listen to him.

282
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:11,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And the three-speech podcast I'll probably never listen to, so you know what?

283
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen to this podcast, it's all you need.

284
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:20,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Major spoiler alert here, but I hear that the next three-speech podcast calls Leo Laporte spastic.

285
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:26,916
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the next one, they tell Reggie if he's made of faggot's anger.

286
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:29,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

287
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,880
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this is kind of interesting, actually.

288
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,483
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been seeing a lot of these weird third-party adapters and stuff come out for the 360.

289
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:46,027
[SPEAKER_08]: This one, though, is being created by XMN, and that's a mod company.

290
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:51,310
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're actually creating an HDMI cable for the regular non-elite

291
00:20:53,373 --> 00:21:19,035
[SPEAKER_08]: and no word yet on how exactly it's going to work but apparently it's going to allow you to use HDMI cables obviously for 1080p on systems that may not be black and supporting a HDMI out on it so the speculation I believe is that it's going to be something that has to do with the VGA cable maybe converting the signal over to work on HDMI I don't know

292
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,852
[SPEAKER_08]: But it should be interesting to see.

293
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:27,615
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to keep an eye on that, check out xcm.cc.

294
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:30,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have all the information on that.

295
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:33,398
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

296
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:36,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, why would I want to get an HDMI cable?

297
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it really that big a difference?

298
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:39,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's a big difference.

299
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:45,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really, you know, if you want that kind of cable for your console.

300
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:48,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're maybe worried that later on when...

301
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,262
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

302
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:11,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Also on the Xbox 360, something you can see in this lovely new HDMI would be some of the new achievements in the NCAA Football 08.

303
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, there's an achievement list, and what's kind of interesting about it is that there's actually some product placement in the achievement list.

304
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:24,848
[SPEAKER_09]: They even use, for the little icons for the achievement, like Pontiac and Old Spice.

305
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,910
[SPEAKER_09]: There are actual official logos there.

306
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to look at what some of these are actually called, some of these achievements.

307
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,134
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get the list for yourself at Xbox360Achievements.org.

308
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:35,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

309
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:36,659
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is, yeah.

310
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Old Spice Red Zone Perfection.

311
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Complete a Play Now or Dynasty Mode game with Red Zone efficiency rating of 100%.

312
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:44,203
[SPEAKER_09]: You get 15 gamer points for that.

313
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:47,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Pontiac Fourth Quarter Comeback, with a little Pontiac logo.

314
00:22:47,344 --> 00:22:51,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Win a Play Now or Dynasty Mode game when down by 14 to start the fourth quarter.

315
00:22:51,706 --> 00:23:00,070
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't understand, but yet still with all these corporate sponsorships, and now they're going to throw their logos into my achievements list, these games are still $60!

316
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:02,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching.

317
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:03,656
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.

318
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:26,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

319
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,163
[SPEAKER_09]: And Solid Goomba in chat says, remember the Fight Night achievements?

320
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:31,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there was like a Burger King match and all that stuff.

321
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,186
[SPEAKER_09]: But the interesting thing about that, I mean, yeah, it hasn't happened in a while though.

322
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:39,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And the interesting thing about this is that these achievements like actually have the company's logos in them.

323
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:45,172
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember that these things will show up on like your gamer thing in the Xbox and when you look on the internet and all that crap.

324
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,074
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just kind of interesting.

325
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:50,756
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to filthy up your profile with corporate logos.

326
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not a problem for me because I hate sports games, but...

327
00:23:54,127 --> 00:23:54,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to tell you this much.

328
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:56,389
[SPEAKER_08]: But you love achievements.

329
00:23:56,749 --> 00:24:02,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I do like achievements, but I'm not going to buy a product because I see a fucking logo for it.

330
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:09,358
[SPEAKER_08]: If it were that easy, then, you know, these people would be making billions upon billions of dollars just for having their logo out there.

331
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:11,360
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just you don't automatically go.

332
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they obviously pay for this because it works.

333
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:14,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's like product recognition.

334
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:15,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I don't know.

335
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:20,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe somebody sees the little Old Spice logo and goes, oh, yeah, I need to pick up, you know, some deodorant.

336
00:24:20,907 --> 00:24:22,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get, you know, get that.

337
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:23,129
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's like in their mind.

338
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:23,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

339
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:24,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

340
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:27,124
[SPEAKER_08]: But, whatever.

341
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:29,335
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

342
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:00,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew you would like this news.

343
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:02,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the game.

344
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:06,201
[SPEAKER_08]: You can pick up a cow with your tractor beam and then hug it.

345
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:07,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I notice there's a theme here.

346
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:10,166
[SPEAKER_09]: You like these games where you get to play as aliens and do things to humans.

347
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:11,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily.

348
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:12,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Grand Theft Auto.

349
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I like sandbox games.

350
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,771
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

351
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:44,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, another very popular series that a lot of people like is Geometry Wars Galaxies.

352
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm sorry, Geometry Wars, but people are looking forward to Geometry War Galaxies because they like the old school one.

353
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:52,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And GameSpot put up a video this week.

354
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:55,884
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a demo of the upcoming Wii title, Geometry Wars Galaxies.

355
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,585
[SPEAKER_09]: But what kind of caused some people to turn around and go, huh?

356
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:05,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that during the demo, the developer actually pauses the game and the word achievements comes up.

357
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:12,560
[SPEAKER_09]: So the question comes up, is this game actually secretly being developed for Xbox 360 as well?

358
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:15,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are there achievements coming to the Wii?

359
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:20,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is it because the game is early in development and it's a port and they just haven't gotten rid of that yet?

360
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's a million different theories, but it certainly has made some people go, huh?

361
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:32,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just probably, you know, not necessarily... It doesn't have to have the achievement system from 360 in order to have achievements.

362
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:33,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, look at Resistance.

363
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:36,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Resistance has achievements in it, but it's just for the game.

364
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:38,793
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not anything... Like internal achievements.

365
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:39,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

366
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,756
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just for unlocking bonus content and stuff like that.

367
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:46,120
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not necessarily... EA has that even on the 360, like the Burnout games.

368
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,642
[SPEAKER_08]: You get those stupid trophies for, like, everything you do.

369
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:49,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

370
00:26:49,463 --> 00:26:50,704
[SPEAKER_09]: You hit the gas pedal.

371
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:51,425
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a trophy.

372
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:52,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

373
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:52,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

374
00:26:53,662 --> 00:27:02,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Another interesting thing, though, coming from Geometry Wars Galaxies is they're going to have download play in there as well.

375
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:12,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you own the DS version of the game, you can actually transfer over and download play a full version of Geometry Wars Retro Evolved onto other stuff.

376
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:19,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, if you have the Wii version, you can transfer over a full version of Geometry Wars Retro Evolved onto the DS.

377
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:22,321
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to have cross-platform play that way.

378
00:27:24,195 --> 00:27:24,639
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Connie.

379
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:24,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

380
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:26,485
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

381
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:57,706
[SPEAKER_09]: The Animal Crossing Island is the thing I always think of.

382
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember in Animal Crossing you could go to the island on the Game Boy?

383
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:00,789
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.

384
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:01,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

385
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:10,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Now another thing that's super awesome, and it's because it's Grand Theft Auto 4, the brand new trailer came out.

386
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:11,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks pretty cool.

387
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:15,326
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't show a whole lot in there, but definitely...

388
00:28:17,587 --> 00:28:20,129
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphics looked a little bit scaled down from what they were before.

389
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:26,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, though, they're probably tweaking it to make sure that the frame rate is good.

390
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:32,978
[SPEAKER_08]: But they did show some gunfights and, of course, car chases and all that fun stuff.

391
00:28:33,438 --> 00:28:37,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just more of a tease right now, and I'm sure there's going to be a new trailer coming out about once a month or so.

392
00:28:38,362 --> 00:28:42,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially with E3 right around the corner, you know there's going to be something that they're going to be teasing at least.

393
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:44,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Only a few months away now.

394
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:49,919
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so are you still very excited about this?

395
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:53,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, was there any kind of revelations that the trailer had for you, or is it just more like mouth-wetting?

396
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,723
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just mouth-wetting.

397
00:28:55,743 --> 00:29:09,434
[SPEAKER_08]: They did show the main character, Nico, actually holding on to the back of a truck, kind of being held on to that, and then also hanging from a helicopter, which looked pretty cool.

398
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,796
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

399
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:13,417
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks awesome.

400
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:15,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I think once we see this game in action...

401
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:16,989
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just going to be phenomenal.

402
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:23,805
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have the collector's edition on order, because I have to have all that crap that comes with it.

403
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:27,178
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

404
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:34,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to get into another segment here, and we're going to go from something very, very new to a classic segment on Orange Lounge Radio.

405
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,681
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a game we like to play, especially during slow news weeks such as this one, called Beat the Host.

406
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:44,442
[SPEAKER_09]: And tonight on Beat the Host, we're going to be looking for a contestant to call us on our Skype line.

407
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:46,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead and call now if you'd like to play.

408
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:51,783
[SPEAKER_09]: However, for tonight's Beat the Host, you should know retro knowledge is really going to help tonight.

409
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:59,452
[SPEAKER_09]: So 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to play, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

410
00:29:59,552 --> 00:30:04,915
[SPEAKER_09]: So go ahead and give us a call right now, and we will take the first person to call in on our Skype line.

411
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:17,401
[SPEAKER_09]: And the way it's going to work, we're going to change up the rules again a little bit tonight, but it is going to have to do with identifying game music or game noise, and I will let you know a little more about that when we get into the game.

412
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:19,342
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're starting to get some calls on the line.

413
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:20,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to a call.

414
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

415
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:22,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

416
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:24,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Ranma.

417
00:30:24,895 --> 00:30:26,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Ranma.

418
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:28,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, a normal sounding call.

419
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:30,963
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our contestant.

420
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:32,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop calling everybody.

421
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:33,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop calling everybody.

422
00:30:33,586 --> 00:30:36,390
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can call later when we open up the Skype line for calls.

423
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma, you ready to play some Beat the Host?

424
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:40,246
Yeah!

425
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:43,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, tonight, you get to challenge Loki.

426
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:50,172
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the only one, because I already know the questions, and well, Irene, you would just whoop her ass, I mean, no matter what the game is.

427
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:51,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what is the topic?

428
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:52,153
[SPEAKER_09]: The topic is Atari 2600 games.

429
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:52,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, pick that.

430
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so Matt, in part A, you may remember, seemed to be, he flaunted his Atari 2600 knowledge.

431
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:05,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like playing Atari 2600, it doesn't mean I've played everything.

432
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:06,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I like combat.

433
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:07,705
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be tough tonight.

434
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:10,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's so tough, we're going to change up the rules of Beat the Host a little bit tonight.

435
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know every time we play Beat the Host, we change the rules.

436
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:13,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Ranma?

437
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:14,427
Yeah.

438
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:19,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so what we're going to do, I'm going to need you to speak nice and loud, or I might not hear you over the game music, okay?

439
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:21,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, hold on, let me, I'm going to leave the chat room.

440
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,301
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, yes, you need to leave the chat room.

441
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:23,781
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

442
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:24,841
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very ethical of you.

443
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:25,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

444
00:31:26,262 --> 00:31:26,542
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

445
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:32,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what's going to happen is that we're going to play some music from Atari 2600 games.

446
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:37,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually recorded myself playing some Atari 2600 games earlier today, and you're going to hear some music from them.

447
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:41,708
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one of you guys to shout out the correct answer gets a point.

448
00:31:42,188 --> 00:31:43,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Game number one

449
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:29,739
[SPEAKER_09]: It's based on a vector arcade game, but the Atari 2600 couldn't support vector graphics.

450
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,560
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

451
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Since there was no separate hyperspace button, you used this by pulling the joystick down.

452
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:41,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Galaxin?

453
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I answer?

454
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:42,781
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

455
00:32:44,602 --> 00:32:47,964
[SPEAKER_09]: When you shoot a rock, it splits into two smaller rocks.

456
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:48,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Asteroids.

457
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:49,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Asteroids.

458
00:32:49,345 --> 00:32:50,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, Loki got it first.

459
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:51,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki gets a point.

460
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:52,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, Loki.

461
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:53,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

462
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:53,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

463
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:54,449
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

464
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:56,350
[SPEAKER_09]: One point for Loki.

465
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,191
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Asteroids.

466
00:32:57,211 --> 00:32:59,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I just didn't remember the er, er, er, er part.

467
00:32:59,432 --> 00:32:59,752
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

468
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:01,533
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here we go.

469
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:03,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to, you ready for number two, Rama?

470
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:03,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

471
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,497
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can get it like three seconds sooner next time, you'll be good.

472
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:07,578
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

473
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,419
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here's song, or game number two.

474
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:14,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Combat.

475
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Loki got it without even a hint.

476
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:24,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew he'd get it when he said he'd played all those Combat back in the day.

477
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:27,029
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not looking at my computer screen, right?

478
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:29,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't see anything on your computer screen.

479
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,430
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Combat.

480
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

481
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:34,092
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the default packing game for the Atari 2600, by the way.

482
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:35,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here we go.

483
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:37,013
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready for number three, Ranma?

484
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:37,953
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do it.

485
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:38,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

486
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:39,514
[SPEAKER_09]: You're losing 2-0.

487
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:40,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what we can do.

488
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,709
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

489
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Tempest.

490
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:51,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

491
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,697
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a version of this on Xbox Live.

492
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:03,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Centipede.

493
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Millipede.

494
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:12,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Pressing the button flapped your wings.

495
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:13,425
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

496
00:34:13,445 --> 00:34:13,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Joust.

497
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you got it.

498
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:19,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

499
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It was joust.

500
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:22,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice job.

501
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:22,864
[SPEAKER_09]: It was joust.

502
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:24,285
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

503
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:24,825
[SPEAKER_09]: 3-0, Ranma.

504
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:26,166
[SPEAKER_09]: You're killing me here.

505
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:27,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, dude.

506
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:28,787
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all right.

507
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:29,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I still love you, man.

508
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:30,508
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

509
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:31,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

510
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:32,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this one is a tricky one.

511
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to tell you straight up.

512
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,231
[SPEAKER_09]: This one is fucking hard, all right?

513
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:35,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we go.

514
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:38,153
[SPEAKER_09]: If either of you get this, I will be very impressed.

515
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:39,514
Boom.

516
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:41,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.

517
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:42,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.

518
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:43,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.

519
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Evil Otto was a character that would chase you.

520
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:56,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Robotron?

521
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:57,315
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

522
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:08,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people know this game from the big happy face bouncing creature that would stalk you.

523
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:09,802
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Evil Otto.

524
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:11,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Frenzy.

525
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:11,923
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

526
00:35:12,804 --> 00:35:15,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.

527
00:35:16,626 --> 00:35:18,507
[SPEAKER_09]: You shot robots in a maze.

528
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:20,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Robotron 23?

529
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:20,708
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

530
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten seconds.

531
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Evil Otto, Big Happy Face, Bouncing Creature, Robots in a Maze.

532
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:33,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Galaxian?

533
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:33,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

534
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:34,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

535
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:36,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Berserk.

536
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:39,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Berserk is the game.

537
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:40,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Berserk.

538
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:42,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had the board game to that.

539
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:43,313
[SPEAKER_09]: You what?

540
00:35:43,954 --> 00:35:45,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had the board game to that, like,

541
00:35:46,388 --> 00:35:47,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, very long time ago.

542
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:49,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, good job.

543
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:50,829
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and, oh well, it happens.

544
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:51,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Brain fart.

545
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:53,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Frenzies just like that game, too.

546
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:55,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job in the chat room, though.

547
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks there got bizarre.

548
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks were saying it was Sword Quest, which was a really good guess, but unfortunately not right.

549
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:04,152
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, this next one's a toughie, too, and I'll also be impressed if either of you get this.

550
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:33,374
[SPEAKER_09]: In this game, you are out to rescue Lady P. Lady P is being held by a jungle tribe.

551
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:34,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.

552
00:36:43,877 --> 00:36:50,501
[SPEAKER_09]: You start this game swinging from rope to rope, then you fight crocodiles, then you dodge falling rocks.

553
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:52,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I please answer?

554
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:52,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

555
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:54,584
[SPEAKER_08]: This wasn't Kongo Bongo.

556
00:36:55,044 --> 00:36:55,204
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

557
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:56,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma, you still with us?

558
00:36:57,485 --> 00:37:00,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know what the game is, I just can't remember the title.

559
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:03,549
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Donkey Kong Jr., is it?

560
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:04,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten seconds, no.

561
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:14,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Lady P, Jungle Tribe, Swinging Ropes, Fighting Crocodiles, Dodging Falling Rocks.

562
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,251
[SPEAKER_09]: You do all that in Jungle Hunt.

563
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:19,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Jungle Hunt.

564
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,472
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, still 3-0 in Loki's favor.

565
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:22,693
[SPEAKER_09]: You can still win it, though.

566
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:23,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

567
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:25,714
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I got an easier one for you this time.

568
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:26,254
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, you ready?

569
00:37:27,155 --> 00:37:27,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Ready.

570
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:27,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

571
00:37:30,196 --> 00:37:30,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man.

572
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:33,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God, that was fast.

573
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:37,658
[SPEAKER_09]: He knew it right from the starting tone there.

574
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:38,879
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Pac-Man.

575
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:44,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's play a little more of that, because I barely got to hear any of it.

576
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember little ghost chasing noises?

577
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:49,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there it is.

578
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:54,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Based on a very popular arcade game, but it was considered a disappointment, the home version.

579
00:37:55,595 --> 00:37:57,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a poster for this at my work.

580
00:37:57,536 --> 00:37:59,917
[SPEAKER_09]: You eat a wafer for bonus points in Pac-Man.

581
00:38:00,818 --> 00:38:01,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.

582
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:02,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn.

583
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:03,319
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

584
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,700
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

585
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,282
[SPEAKER_09]: There's four left, so Ranma, you can still tie it up.

586
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:08,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Working on it.

587
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:09,303
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

588
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:10,629
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alright Ranma.

589
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,910
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a long time ago.

590
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I barely remember these when I was playing through them today.

591
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:15,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, now this one is fun.

592
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:17,935
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's a tricky one, but I love this game.

593
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:19,956
Burger time.

594
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:20,056
No.

595
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:34,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Ranma gets one!

596
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:35,956
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Popeye.

597
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:36,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounded familiar.

598
00:38:37,237 --> 00:38:37,638
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

599
00:38:37,778 --> 00:38:40,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you can kind of hear a little theme being used in the game.

600
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:44,043
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a movie out around the same time.

601
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:48,006
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember, this was a really cool game at the time because the stages were so unique.

602
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:54,932
[SPEAKER_09]: And in that first stage that you were hearing, Olive Oil was actually throwing hearts down that you had to catch before they sank in the water.

603
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma is on the board!

604
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:57,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, Ranma.

605
00:38:58,123 --> 00:38:58,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Pitfall 2 Pitfall 2

606
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:27,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, poor Ranma.

607
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:28,008
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Pitfall 2.

608
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:31,229
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one of the first games to feature a full soundtrack.

609
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,930
[SPEAKER_09]: The sequel to another popular Atari game and the main character was Pitfall, Harry.

610
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma, so close.

611
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:38,491
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

612
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:41,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because Loki pisses me off sometimes, I'm going to give that to you anyway.

613
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,152
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to give it to you.

614
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:42,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.

615
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:43,152
All right.

616
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:45,433
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so there we go.

617
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:46,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do we have?

618
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Four for Loki, two for Ranma.

619
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:49,174
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here we go.

620
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:51,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to another one.

621
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:52,415
[SPEAKER_09]: This one is also very hard.

622
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:52,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

623
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:02,575
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

624
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:10,257
[SPEAKER_09]: This game was also based on a popular movie series.

625
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:11,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Trek?

626
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:12,097
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

627
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Wars?

628
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:13,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

629
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:14,897
[SPEAKER_01]: E.T.?

630
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:15,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

631
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,459
[SPEAKER_09]: You can walk into a phone booth to change from one character to another.

632
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:24,519
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

633
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:26,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Superman?

634
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Ranma got it.

635
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,540
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Superman.

636
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah...

637
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the Superman game?

638
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:32,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

639
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:36,545
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so weird because, like, you could fly up and you would fly into another screen.

640
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:39,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you moved up, down, left, and right.

641
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:39,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it was weird.

642
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:40,607
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very weird.

643
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:41,528
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

644
00:40:41,588 --> 00:40:42,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma's got three now.

645
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:44,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because you gave him one.

646
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I did.

647
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally gave him one.

648
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:45,991
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

649
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:46,752
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

650
00:40:47,672 --> 00:40:48,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if we can tie it up, Ranma.

651
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:49,894
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the last one.

652
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:50,795
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

653
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a doozy.

654
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:53,356
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a hell of a game.

655
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:53,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

656
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:59,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Miss Pac-Man.

657
00:40:59,541 --> 00:40:59,681
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

658
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:01,958
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

659
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,442
[SPEAKER_09]: This game was made by Mystique Entertainment.

660
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:11,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Adventure?

661
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:12,443
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

662
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:18,467
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

663
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:23,730
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a highly controversial game that shows up on lots of gag Atari 2600 lists.

664
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Custer's Revenge.

665
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:27,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, Loki.

666
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:29,316
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Custer's Revenge.

667
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:31,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, the object of the game.

668
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:36,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Your naked ass has to fuck an Indian girl lots and lots and that's why the game is very controversial.

669
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,234
[SPEAKER_10]: You were just playing that earlier.

670
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:40,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's when I was recording the clips.

671
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, that was so funny.

672
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:43,878
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you couldn't play because you walked in here when I was setting it up.

673
00:41:44,078 --> 00:41:44,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.

674
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:56,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well the final score Ranma, you got three points a very good showing and unfortunately Loki beat you with five so unfortunately you got beat by the host tonight but you made a damn good effort on a very tough topic.

675
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:57,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, man.

676
00:41:57,534 --> 00:41:58,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

677
00:41:58,335 --> 00:41:59,616
[SPEAKER_09]: No problemo.

678
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:04,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Take any shout-outs or plugs you want to give as long as we have you on the air as a consolation prize.

679
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Visit my website, www.djranmas.net.

680
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:10,023
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

681
00:42:11,705 --> 00:42:12,105
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

682
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:12,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

683
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:13,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Ranma.

684
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:13,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

685
00:42:13,746 --> 00:42:14,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

686
00:42:14,347 --> 00:42:14,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

687
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:16,508
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

688
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:25,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the audio looked a little low to me on the board here, but it seems like the chat room was able to play along just fine, so I'm hoping the audio was just fine there as far as...

689
00:42:26,857 --> 00:42:28,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Live radio, boys and girls.

690
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:28,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Take it or leave it.

691
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:36,639
[SPEAKER_09]: HURRICAN

692
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:05,895
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can download Hurricane from the site hurrican-game.de because it's German.

693
00:43:06,035 --> 00:43:07,296
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a 40 megabyte game.

694
00:43:07,436 --> 00:43:13,222
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Windows compatible and if you remember gaming on the Commodore 64, you're probably going to love this.

695
00:43:13,622 --> 00:43:15,304
[SPEAKER_09]: So check it out, Hurricane.

696
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:23,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Another game that's getting a sequel and it's long due, I think, and this is, I guess, a rumor for right now, but Parasite Eve is...

697
00:43:24,884 --> 00:43:28,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Slated on possibly coming out to the PlayStation 3 and 360.

698
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:36,351
[SPEAKER_08]: And no word exactly on any details on that, but I don't know.

699
00:43:36,932 --> 00:43:43,136
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess people were thinking, because they originally announced Parasite Eve 3 as a mobile game, but they're thinking this is going to be something else.

700
00:43:44,737 --> 00:43:53,883
[SPEAKER_08]: It says also, I guess Quarterman from EGM is saying that they're going to be, Hideo Kojima is going to be...

701
00:43:54,684 --> 00:43:54,924
[SPEAKER_08]: I was?

702
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:55,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I was.

703
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'm smoking crack.

704
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:22,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was a good game.

705
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:26,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I never actually beat it, but I played through a good part of it.

706
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:28,299
[SPEAKER_08]: That was me in most Final Fantasy games.

707
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the combat system in that.

708
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:35,644
[SPEAKER_08]: The combat system in the first Parasite Eve reminds me much of what they're doing in Final Fantasy XII right now.

709
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:41,528
[SPEAKER_08]: How that system, you know, kind of, you have a big dome or whatever that you can attack in and stuff.

710
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:43,669
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminds me very much of that.

711
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:48,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, before we get to the Skype line, I got one more story for you guys.

712
00:44:48,428 --> 00:44:54,570
[SPEAKER_09]: And since it is July 1st, also known as Canada Day, I thought those of you Canadians would appreciate this.

713
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,771
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get a red PlayStation 3, and it's a special kind of Canada event.

714
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,052
[SPEAKER_09]: You can only get this in Canada.

715
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:06,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's actually a contest that's being held, and the contest is being run through July 15th at playstation.ca.

716
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:15,858
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can actually win yourself a red PlayStation 3 or a limited edition Canada PlayStation 3 t-shirt there.

717
00:45:16,218 --> 00:45:19,000
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have the maple leaf on it, but it has a 3 in place of the maple leaf.

718
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, it kind of looks like the Canadian flag.

719
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

720
00:45:23,002 --> 00:45:26,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Only three of those red PlayStation 3s, by the way, will be made.

721
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:28,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of neat.

722
00:45:28,825 --> 00:45:32,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, technically four, since there's already been a red PlayStation 3 out there custom made.

723
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:33,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's different, though.

724
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:37,189
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of officially endorsed, so to speak, by Sony, so...

725
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:42,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you have some Canadian listeners there, so you might want to go enter that contest and brag to all your friends, eh?

726
00:45:42,723 --> 00:45:46,564
[SPEAKER_08]: This is completely random, but I feel that we should talk about this real quick.

727
00:45:47,105 --> 00:45:49,985
[SPEAKER_08]: We went over the fries the other day, because I had my motherboard.

728
00:45:50,466 --> 00:45:51,446
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a fan that went out.

729
00:45:51,486 --> 00:45:53,726
[SPEAKER_08]: My computer is kind of on the fritz.

730
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:58,828
[SPEAKER_08]: But we saw, or Nelly picked up this USB stripper.

731
00:45:59,588 --> 00:46:01,489
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on a stripping pole that you can buy.

732
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:06,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen that before, because we were thinking about getting it for her for her birthday before we realized we were all freaking poor.

733
00:46:07,486 --> 00:46:08,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was funny.

734
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:08,726
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

735
00:46:08,846 --> 00:46:09,527
[SPEAKER_09]: That was great.

736
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:11,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you guys actually see it in motion or what?

737
00:46:12,108 --> 00:46:13,208
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but we almost bought it.

738
00:46:13,648 --> 00:46:18,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, like, common sense kicked in and we said, no, we probably don't need a $30 USB stripper.

739
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:20,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

740
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

741
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:28,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Because she wanted to take it to work and, you know, her work wouldn't really, you know, think too highly of that.

742
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:40,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well we're going to open up the Skype line if you'd like to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can call us on the actual program Skype.

743
00:46:41,455 --> 00:46:43,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio is our username.

744
00:46:43,316 --> 00:46:49,457
[SPEAKER_09]: We always like to hear from our listeners and get your guys' two cents on what's going on in the gaming scene and the gaming community.

745
00:46:49,497 --> 00:46:56,379
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have any feedback to tonight's articles or what have you or you just want to tell Rice Princess to say hi to you and actually talk on the program tonight.

746
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,624
[SPEAKER_09]: All of that you can do by calling our program.

747
00:47:00,104 --> 00:47:03,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So while we wait for some calls, because there's a little bit of a lag, do you have any last minute stories?

748
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:03,986
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

749
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:04,926
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

750
00:47:05,046 --> 00:47:06,127
[SPEAKER_09]: No last minute stories tonight?

751
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at the moment.

752
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:09,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, it really is a slow gaming week.

753
00:47:09,128 --> 00:47:12,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking for stuff, but I haven't seen anything.

754
00:47:15,491 --> 00:47:17,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Well... Should I pick up Project Silphid?

755
00:47:17,892 --> 00:47:22,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't... I saw it scroll by your screen there, and I'm curious about that game, but I don't know.

756
00:47:23,516 --> 00:47:24,056
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks okay.

757
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get this t-shirt.

758
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:44,224
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like one of those Target t-shirts, like the don't bother me ones, and it says good, and it has, you know, the male, female, like almost looks like a restroom-like logo or something, and that's good, and then better has a guy with two girls, and then best shows a guy playing a video game.

759
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:46,525
[SPEAKER_08]: We're finally getting calls, thank God.

760
00:47:47,245 --> 00:47:48,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

761
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:48,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

762
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

763
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:54,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

764
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:59,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

765
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:00,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

766
00:48:02,976 --> 00:48:03,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, damn it.

767
00:48:03,357 --> 00:48:03,837
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't work.

768
00:48:03,857 --> 00:48:06,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

769
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:08,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

770
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:14,663
[SPEAKER_09]: If you always wanted to test your Skype line, you can do that by calling Echo123.

771
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:20,007
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the username on Skype if you'd always like to test your connection in advance, which we highly recommend.

772
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:21,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

773
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:21,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

774
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.

775
00:48:24,381 --> 00:48:26,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up DJ Tyrant?

776
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:26,963
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

777
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:29,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm doing pretty good.

778
00:48:29,526 --> 00:48:32,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at Anime Expo 2007 right now.

779
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:33,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

780
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:36,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you actually got into Anime Expo 2007 on behalf of Orange Launch Radio, right?

781
00:48:37,953 --> 00:48:38,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.

782
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:41,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, then you better have a good report for us.

783
00:48:41,095 --> 00:48:42,537
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on at Anime Expo?

784
00:48:44,278 --> 00:48:46,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of anime, fandom type stuff.

785
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:49,663
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a lot of gaming stuff also.

786
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:52,835
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I check out today?

787
00:48:52,895 --> 00:48:55,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I checked out the Naruto fighting game for the Wii.

788
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:59,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a little sloppy for that, though.

789
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what was sloppy?

790
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,461
[SPEAKER_09]: The controls are sloppy?

791
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:02,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

792
00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:03,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that sucks.

793
00:49:05,384 --> 00:49:11,148
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's Guilty Gear, the new one, XX, forget the subtitle for that.

794
00:49:11,488 --> 00:49:12,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Accent Core.

795
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki says it's Accent Core.

796
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:17,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds right.

797
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get to play it, but it looked pretty solid.

798
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they are.

799
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently Square has a bunch of stuff for Eleven.

800
00:49:23,982 --> 00:49:26,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get to swing by their booth because I don't play Eleven, but...

801
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:43,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of people with stuff from Final Fantasy XI Yeah, there's

802
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:09,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons.

803
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:15,683
[SPEAKER_01]: As the resident's wow addict, I found about three really, really good costumes.

804
00:50:16,243 --> 00:50:21,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll post some pictures up when I get home, but they're, like, really well done.

805
00:50:21,766 --> 00:50:25,548
[SPEAKER_01]: They look exactly like they look in game, which I found really impressive.

806
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:32,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Ranma would like to point out, for those of us here, that Anime Expo is not an anime con.

807
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,491
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a trade show.

808
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:35,652
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently there's a very distinct difference.

809
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:39,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess because I don't follow the con scene enough, it kind of feels the same to me.

810
00:50:42,955 --> 00:50:44,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what about, you said there was some gaming stuff there.

811
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:45,776
[SPEAKER_09]: What about tournaments?

812
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:46,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Has there been any big tournaments?

813
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:48,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I know these cons usually have a game room.

814
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:50,118
[SPEAKER_09]: What kinds of stuff have been around in the game rooms?

815
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:53,819
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pretty big console room with Guitar Hero and

816
00:50:54,707 --> 00:50:57,149
[SPEAKER_01]: The typical fighting type games.

817
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:05,277
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Pokemon tournament last night and there's been various fighting game tournaments for Guilty Gear and Naruto.

818
00:51:06,158 --> 00:51:07,079
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Smash Bros.

819
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:10,862
[SPEAKER_01]: tournament tomorrow that I will be playing in and losing in the first round in.

820
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:14,766
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a lot of stuff for gamers to do at the show.

821
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:16,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Smash Bros.

822
00:51:16,262 --> 00:51:17,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Tournament Super Smash Bros.

823
00:51:17,503 --> 00:51:18,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Tournament Super Smash Bros.

824
00:51:18,563 --> 00:51:18,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Tournament

825
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,083
[SPEAKER_09]: So how long is the con running?

826
00:51:49,344 --> 00:51:51,985
[SPEAKER_09]: How long is the con?

827
00:51:52,045 --> 00:51:52,785
[SPEAKER_09]: It ends tomorrow?

828
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:53,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

829
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:57,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well make sure you go get your hands on Guilty Gear for us so you can give some impressions of it.

830
00:51:58,288 --> 00:52:00,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely will.

831
00:52:01,029 --> 00:52:09,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma would like to clarify, Anime Expo is a trade show because their board of directors are people from the anime industry and they use Anime Expo to promote new titles more than any other con.

832
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:12,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Think of Anime Expo as the anime equivalent of E3.

833
00:52:13,194 --> 00:52:14,355
[SPEAKER_09]: and Insanus adds to that.

834
00:52:14,515 --> 00:52:16,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Anime Expo sucks.

835
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:17,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's an opinion.

836
00:52:17,877 --> 00:52:19,639
[SPEAKER_09]: But you sound like you're having a lot of fun at the con, right?

837
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:20,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, Jimmy?

838
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,061
[SPEAKER_01]: He just wants to kick you because he can't come to it.

839
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:26,944
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, Jimmy, anything else you want to add about the convention?

840
00:52:28,865 --> 00:52:30,587
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can come next year, we can come hang out.

841
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy drinks.

842
00:52:31,988 --> 00:52:33,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hey, if there's drinks there, I'm there.

843
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:37,512
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I will be in SoCal for E for All, so we'll see you then.

844
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:40,214
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, have a nice night, guys.

845
00:52:40,334 --> 00:52:40,894
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, later, buddy.

846
00:52:41,334 --> 00:52:41,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the call.

847
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:42,215
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

848
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:43,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

849
00:52:43,428 --> 00:52:46,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Our roving reporter, Jimmy, also known as DJ Tyrant.

850
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:48,510
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to the phones.

851
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

852
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

853
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,391
[SPEAKER_09]: It's GS68.

854
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:53,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, GS68.

855
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:54,811
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, my friend?

856
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:59,653
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, that was me calling before Matt because my mic wasn't set up right.

857
00:53:00,533 --> 00:53:00,973
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

858
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:01,613
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll forgive you.

859
00:53:01,853 --> 00:53:05,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you hear us yelling at you in Spanish and everything?

860
00:53:05,874 --> 00:53:06,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

861
00:53:06,554 --> 00:53:06,855
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

862
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:08,635
[SPEAKER_09]: That's got to be embarrassing.

863
00:53:08,675 --> 00:53:09,615
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, now you're on.

864
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:10,356
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

865
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:12,096
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I have...

866
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:17,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I was eating cup noodles when Rice Princess was saying fag or anger so I had to spit that out.

867
00:53:20,098 --> 00:53:21,398
[SPEAKER_09]: What else do you want to talk about tonight, GS68?

868
00:53:37,546 --> 00:53:44,148
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Guitar Hero message board, I've been talking about the hyperspeed code lately and how some people think it's a cheat.

869
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:45,348
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on it?

870
00:53:45,628 --> 00:53:47,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not know of the hyperspeed code.

871
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:48,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me a little background on this.

872
00:53:48,369 --> 00:53:48,889
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this about?

873
00:53:50,549 --> 00:54:00,052
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Guitar Hero 2 title screen, you press orange, blue, orange, yellow, orange, blue, orange, yellow, and then it says cheat activated hyperspeed.

874
00:54:01,252 --> 00:54:02,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And what exactly does that do to the game?

875
00:54:02,612 --> 00:54:04,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it make the songs run faster or something?

876
00:54:05,357 --> 00:54:07,378
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it makes the notes scroll faster.

877
00:54:07,558 --> 00:54:12,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like times two speed in DDR or high speed in Beatmania.

878
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

879
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know if that's cheating or not.

880
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:21,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess maybe the developers intended it to be a cheat if that's what they're labeling it as in the game.

881
00:54:21,403 --> 00:54:22,303
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

882
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in Beatmania, I never considered that a cheat.

883
00:54:24,704 --> 00:54:27,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, God, that's what you have to use to play some of those songs.

884
00:54:27,785 --> 00:54:28,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know any other way.

885
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:29,365
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

886
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:31,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it is cheating even in Beatmania.

887
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:34,467
[SPEAKER_09]: And for whatever reason, the community doesn't really look at it that way.

888
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:39,033
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think they just never looked at it that way because it's always been considered a modifier.

889
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:39,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

890
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:53,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like, people whose music game experience is one of the Guitar Hero, like, have never heard of it being a mod, so when they saw that it was a cheat, they automatically thought it was a cheat because it has cheat activated.

891
00:54:54,102 --> 00:54:55,342
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on it?

892
00:54:56,523 --> 00:54:57,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's legit.

893
00:54:57,944 --> 00:55:02,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you think it helps you, just use it.

894
00:55:02,807 --> 00:55:03,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

895
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:12,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's still the same notes, right?

896
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:12,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

897
00:55:12,995 --> 00:55:15,297
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not going to help you beat Jordan on Expert, right?

898
00:55:16,618 --> 00:55:17,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, probably not.

899
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what's the big freaking deal?

900
00:55:22,303 --> 00:55:26,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you close your eyes and play the song, I mean, does Hyper Speed really make a difference?

901
00:55:28,668 --> 00:55:32,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you close your eyes and play the song, is that how you have to beat Jordan on Expert?

902
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:32,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably, huh?

903
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:46,142
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've actually gone to the great extents to memorize Guitar Hero 2 songs, instead of using the speed modifier, I would recommend you go outside.

904
00:55:49,163 --> 00:55:49,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just messing.

905
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:50,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Hypothetically speaking.

906
00:55:51,144 --> 00:55:52,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.

907
00:55:52,325 --> 00:55:55,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, people memorize the DDR songs, so why not the Guitar Hero songs?

908
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:56,147
[SPEAKER_09]: It happens.

909
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:58,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, any other thoughts, GS68?

910
00:55:58,648 --> 00:55:58,768
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

911
00:55:58,788 --> 00:55:58,828
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

912
00:56:01,343 --> 00:56:02,003
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much it

913
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:31,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing much.

914
00:56:32,132 --> 00:56:34,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Thought y'all would talk about Soul Calibur for a little bit.

915
00:56:34,714 --> 00:56:36,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to touch up on something I discussed last week.

916
00:56:37,236 --> 00:56:39,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, Soul Calibur 4 online, good stuff.

917
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:40,258
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

918
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:44,981
[SPEAKER_05]: There's supposed to be like a sad story game, Soul Calibur Legends.

919
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:49,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that was the game that's being created for the Nintendo Wii if I remember right, right?

920
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:52,366
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not side-scrolling though, it's just kind of a hack and slash.

921
00:56:55,989 --> 00:56:59,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that how Mortal Kombat, what was that, Shaolin Monks or whatever was kind of like that?

922
00:56:59,591 --> 00:56:59,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

923
00:57:00,052 --> 00:57:00,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

924
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:17,409
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking more of Tekken Force I would say it looks more like the Immortal Combat Channel amongst games Because I know Tekken Force is more like Final Fight or something like that Here's the only thing I care about, is Ivy in it, yes or no?

925
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:18,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes Sold!

926
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:26,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be a multiple problem round 6 for you, I think, if I'm not mistaken Alright, well what else have you heard on the game?

927
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, just early development details and whatnot.

928
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:40,385
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a picture on it on Kotaku.com and it just looked like a test shot because all it saw was basically Siegfried swinging his sword around a bunch of mummies.

929
00:57:42,846 --> 00:57:47,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I like the concept and all, so.

930
00:57:48,629 --> 00:57:52,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the type of game you think you're going to buy?

931
00:57:52,311 --> 00:57:53,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't own a Wii, so.

932
00:57:53,692 --> 00:57:54,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you don't own a Wii.

933
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that because you don't want one or because you can't find one?

934
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:00,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, both.

935
00:58:01,152 --> 00:58:03,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I actually decided that I was gonna go get, um, 360.

936
00:58:04,254 --> 00:58:04,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, okay.

937
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:05,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

938
00:58:05,955 --> 00:58:08,216
[SPEAKER_05]: But that won't be until November, so that would offset itself.

939
00:58:08,336 --> 00:58:11,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you never know, you might luck out, maybe the game will come out cross-platform.

940
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:14,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, give it time and whatnot.

941
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:19,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, another game I had on mind, but I think I just totally lost track.

942
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:22,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Guitar Hero 80s.

943
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I actually saw the, um, song list and everything.

944
00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:27,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are actually some decent songs in that list.

945
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:30,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why some of y'all didn't like some of the songs.

946
00:58:30,412 --> 00:58:31,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what's your problem, Rice Princess?

947
00:58:31,752 --> 00:58:33,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't you like Guitar Hero's 80s editions?

948
00:58:33,613 --> 00:58:35,054
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your big issue?

949
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:38,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if I knew any of the songs, I might like it better.

950
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:40,087
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

951
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:09,480
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a baby.

952
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:13,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember Friendship Bracelets and Garbage Pail Kids?

953
00:59:13,444 --> 00:59:15,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, do you remember Slap Bracelets?

954
00:59:15,146 --> 00:59:15,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do.

955
00:59:15,847 --> 00:59:17,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, those were pretty awesome.

956
00:59:17,529 --> 00:59:18,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And Hypercolor shirts.

957
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, anyway.

958
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:20,492
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow.

959
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:22,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then I don't know what her problem is.

960
00:59:23,035 --> 00:59:24,617
[SPEAKER_09]: She was just listening to the wrong kind of music in the 80s.

961
00:59:25,523 --> 00:59:26,724
[SPEAKER_10]: The wrong kind of music?

962
00:59:26,804 --> 00:59:27,184
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't.

963
00:59:27,504 --> 00:59:30,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to admit, I'm not that excited about the track list either, Dark Knight.

964
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,187
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some songs that made me go, woohoo!

965
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:34,428
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of it kind of makes me go, hmm.

966
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:36,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really a memorable song.

967
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:39,490
[SPEAKER_09]: But what to you makes a song list great?

968
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:40,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Convince us we're wrong.

969
00:59:41,892 --> 00:59:42,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me Stairway.

970
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:44,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Turning Japanese might be one.

971
00:59:45,153 --> 00:59:48,315
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I had the power to add a song, give me Stairway to Heaven.

972
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:49,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I know exactly.

973
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:50,896
[SPEAKER_09]: No Stairway denied.

974
00:59:52,937 --> 00:59:53,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

975
00:59:53,278 --> 00:59:53,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

976
00:59:55,455 --> 00:59:56,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Knight, we gotta let you go.

977
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:57,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Any last thoughts real quick?

978
00:59:59,698 --> 01:00:04,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you need to start playing PSU again because, well, that's right, you have 360.

979
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:05,642
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably already got it.

980
01:00:06,122 --> 01:00:08,644
[SPEAKER_05]: But they recently gave out Sonic statues.

981
01:00:09,444 --> 01:00:09,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

982
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:15,288
[SPEAKER_09]: No, God, I haven't touched the game in forever, but I think my membership's still active and I'm paying for it.

983
01:00:15,308 --> 01:00:16,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I just haven't gone into the game in forever, so...

984
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:18,429
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

985
01:00:18,469 --> 01:00:20,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, everybody got Sonic statue now.

986
01:00:20,371 --> 01:00:20,791
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

987
01:00:21,572 --> 01:00:23,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Pull me away from World of Warcraft, seriously.

988
01:00:23,974 --> 01:00:28,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like, I know I'm going to get so much hate mail like, Rob, play a real game, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

989
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:34,602
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can't explain how addicting this game is and it's the social end of it completely because the fact that a lot of my friends play it.

990
01:00:35,122 --> 01:00:37,324
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not even really the game itself that I'm in love with.

991
01:00:37,684 --> 01:00:38,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in love with Ventrilo.

992
01:00:39,126 --> 01:00:40,026
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my problem.

993
01:00:40,627 --> 01:00:44,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to go into detail about the Ventrilo thing.

994
01:00:45,611 --> 01:00:47,312
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's just right now the game

995
01:00:48,214 --> 01:00:51,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of winding down now because the expansion is coming.

996
01:00:51,998 --> 01:00:57,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hopefully the expansion will give it a badly needed kick in the pants because I would like to get back into some PSU.

997
01:00:59,144 --> 01:00:59,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

998
01:00:59,705 --> 01:01:08,292
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, quick plug for my show because I do a show on Disney Genius Radio, Dark Knight Ninja Dojo on Thursday nights.

999
01:01:08,553 --> 01:01:09,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to join if you like.

1000
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:13,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically going to be talking about this week, the iPhones.

1001
01:01:14,023 --> 01:01:14,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, iPhone.

1002
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:15,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw one this week.

1003
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:16,245
[SPEAKER_09]: They're very pretty.

1004
01:01:16,485 --> 01:01:20,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I will try to tune in and I think I'm supposed to be on the show this week or very soon, yes?

1005
01:01:22,089 --> 01:01:22,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1006
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:23,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1007
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott will be there, hopefully.

1008
01:01:25,592 --> 01:01:27,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I just have to double check my personal calendar, but I should be there.

1009
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:29,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1010
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:30,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1011
01:01:30,536 --> 01:01:31,517
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1012
01:01:31,777 --> 01:01:32,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care, buddy.

1013
01:01:32,637 --> 01:01:33,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for calling.

1014
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:34,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, folks.

1015
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:35,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1016
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Knight here on Orange Launch Radio.

1017
01:01:37,301 --> 01:01:37,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1018
01:01:38,263 --> 01:01:40,524
[SPEAKER_09]: and everybody's got their own show these days.

1019
01:01:40,584 --> 01:01:41,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear to God.

1020
01:01:41,725 --> 01:01:42,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Swear to God.

1021
01:01:42,686 --> 01:01:43,406
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's all good though.

1022
01:01:43,426 --> 01:01:44,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Dark Knight.

1023
01:01:44,747 --> 01:01:46,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on.

1024
01:01:48,429 --> 01:01:50,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to punch that guy in the face.

1025
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,110
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who you are.

1026
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:51,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Punch him in the neck.

1027
01:01:51,971 --> 01:01:53,111
[SPEAKER_09]: You told me you fixed it.

1028
01:01:56,233 --> 01:01:57,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's another edit.

1029
01:01:58,594 --> 01:01:59,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, forget it.

1030
01:01:59,115 --> 01:01:59,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to edit that out.

1031
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:01,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Podcast listeners, you guys can deal with it.

1032
01:02:01,956 --> 01:02:02,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Way to be lazy.

1033
01:02:02,516 --> 01:02:03,617
[SPEAKER_09]: That was DMN, by the way.

1034
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:07,079
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to hate somebody for blowing your ears out, that was Insanest

1035
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,161
[SPEAKER_09]: DMM, whatever the hell your name is right now.

1036
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:10,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Love you!

1037
01:02:11,502 --> 01:02:12,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.

1038
01:02:12,443 --> 01:02:12,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1039
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:15,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Mushy Mushy.

1040
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:16,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Mushy Mushy?

1041
01:02:16,505 --> 01:02:19,647
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's relevant.

1042
01:02:20,107 --> 01:02:21,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like you're saying hello.

1043
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear myself.

1044
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,531
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

1045
01:02:26,571 --> 01:02:27,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes there is a bit of an echo.

1046
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:29,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Identify yourself, please.

1047
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, uh, Nintendo Maniac 64.

1048
01:02:31,494 --> 01:02:32,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo Maniac 64.

1049
01:02:32,974 --> 01:02:33,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, my friend?

1050
01:02:34,895 --> 01:02:35,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, dealing with the

1051
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:39,022
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

1052
01:02:39,062 --> 01:02:43,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a letter... Is this your first Japanese listener on the show?

1053
01:02:43,784 --> 01:02:45,665
[SPEAKER_04]: A letter in the book?

1054
01:02:45,985 --> 01:02:56,570
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think Peker Uno is also in Japan from my following him on Twitter, because I actually have a Twitter account, and some of the listeners have me added on there as Sky on Twitter, and I picked up that he's in Japan.

1055
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:59,692
[SPEAKER_09]: So... Is he really Japanese, though?

1056
01:03:00,392 --> 01:03:03,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't the foggiest idea, but I'm sure I'm going to get a Twitter about it now.

1057
01:03:04,194 --> 01:03:04,334
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1058
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:09,489
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't even know if our guy's message is Japanese.

1059
01:03:09,749 --> 01:03:11,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I've looked at the statistics.

1060
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,631
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have some Japanese listeners.

1061
01:03:12,651 --> 01:03:15,213
[SPEAKER_09]: We have listeners all over the world, just not all of them are vocal.

1062
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:19,516
[SPEAKER_09]: But I understand, it takes a lot of effort to write an email, so no expectations.

1063
01:03:19,936 --> 01:03:28,261
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think this guy's the first one, but he's the first email I can recall getting from Japan, but we have had emails from other parts of Asia.

1064
01:03:29,322 --> 01:03:29,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1065
01:03:29,862 --> 01:03:35,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, oh yeah, you know how I was talking about earlier with the

1066
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:36,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Outro

1067
01:04:00,521 --> 01:04:04,023
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know, well, I don't know, because culturally over here, that's not really a bad word.

1068
01:04:04,084 --> 01:04:07,826
[SPEAKER_09]: But I suppose, you know, if the game had called me a fag, I may not have liked that.

1069
01:04:07,866 --> 01:04:09,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, you know who we could ask?

1070
01:04:09,587 --> 01:04:10,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, no, wait.

1071
01:04:10,628 --> 01:04:11,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Where is it a bad word?

1072
01:04:11,529 --> 01:04:11,949
[SPEAKER_10]: In England?

1073
01:04:12,069 --> 01:04:12,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1074
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,170
[SPEAKER_10]: We could ask Sasha.

1075
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think he's listening.

1076
01:04:15,111 --> 01:04:15,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see him in chat tonight.

1077
01:04:15,972 --> 01:04:16,412
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not listening.

1078
01:04:16,432 --> 01:04:17,293
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he listens to your show.

1079
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:17,953
[SPEAKER_10]: He's sleeping.

1080
01:04:17,993 --> 01:04:18,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he does.

1081
01:04:18,253 --> 01:04:18,533
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1082
01:04:18,553 --> 01:04:20,855
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of late over there in Britain right now, so we don't have a lot of time.

1083
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:22,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I'll ask him.

1084
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:22,996
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1085
01:04:23,096 --> 01:04:23,537
[SPEAKER_09]: You do that.

1086
01:04:23,797 --> 01:04:25,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Call him a spastic and see what happens.

1087
01:04:26,059 --> 01:04:26,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no.

1088
01:04:26,939 --> 01:04:28,900
[SPEAKER_10]: He might make me number two on his MySpace.

1089
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:29,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1090
01:04:31,098 --> 01:04:37,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I love how Rice Princess' biggest concern in the world is that OMG, I might get demoted in the top 8 on Myspace.

1091
01:04:37,299 --> 01:04:38,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, pretty much.

1092
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a life, woman.

1093
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't.

1094
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,981
[SPEAKER_09]: It's never going to happen.

1095
01:04:44,841 --> 01:04:47,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Orange Lounge Radio has a Myspace, so I can't complain too much.

1096
01:04:47,882 --> 01:04:49,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Nintendo Maniac, anything else on your mind?

1097
01:04:50,683 --> 01:04:53,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I finally, finally got TimeSplitters 2.

1098
01:04:53,343 --> 01:04:54,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying to find it forever.

1099
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:55,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally got it.

1100
01:04:55,784 --> 01:05:00,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And that brick-smashing glass level, I got gold in it, and like

1101
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:08,269
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets harder as you pass through some of the levels in there.

1102
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:09,669
[SPEAKER_08]: What exactly do you do in this level, Loki?

1103
01:05:09,709 --> 01:05:12,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's, like, they have different levels, like, breaking stuff.

1104
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:15,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually it'll be with a brick or something, and you have to smash windows.

1105
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:20,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, you have to throw a brick through it, and it's pretty hard.

1106
01:05:20,991 --> 01:05:24,592
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go through and... I think it's a little shorter, actually, if I think of it.

1107
01:05:25,152 --> 01:05:25,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Either way.

1108
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,033
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1109
01:05:28,228 --> 01:05:32,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to go ahead and let you go, buddy, but thanks so much for giving us a call and enjoy TimeSplitters, okay?

1110
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:33,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1111
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:34,410
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1112
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:35,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

1113
01:05:36,111 --> 01:05:36,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1114
01:05:37,311 --> 01:05:37,571
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1115
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:40,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's going to do it tonight for the Skype line.

1116
01:05:40,132 --> 01:05:41,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to those calls we didn't get to.

1117
01:05:41,412 --> 01:05:45,194
[SPEAKER_09]: We did have a lot of calls coming through, but we have a lot.

1118
01:05:45,414 --> 01:05:46,554
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been on the air quite a while now.

1119
01:05:46,574 --> 01:05:47,474
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to wrap things up.

1120
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,875
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go around now.

1121
01:05:49,935 --> 01:05:52,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Since there's no last-minute stories, we're going to go around and get everybody's... No, no, no.

1122
01:05:52,736 --> 01:05:53,396
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the case.

1123
01:05:53,557 --> 01:05:54,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you found something.

1124
01:05:54,377 --> 01:05:54,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, of course.

1125
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:57,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I was taking the time to pull up the stories.

1126
01:05:57,558 --> 01:05:57,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.

1127
01:05:58,564 --> 01:06:05,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And the rumor is, apparently, Beautiful Katamari is going to be skipping the PlayStation 3 and going straight to the Wii.

1128
01:06:06,048 --> 01:06:10,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's supposed to be coming out next year on the Wii.

1129
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:14,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, to be honest, though, I would say it's coming out in both fiscal year 2008.

1130
01:06:15,053 --> 01:06:17,774
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my guess, though.

1131
01:06:18,014 --> 01:06:19,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't you get in trouble for that once before?

1132
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, no.

1133
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:23,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm guessing...

1134
01:06:24,275 --> 01:06:27,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but if I were to guess, I would say it's coming fiscal year 2008.

1135
01:06:28,397 --> 01:06:30,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly don't give a fuck anymore.

1136
01:06:30,777 --> 01:06:31,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

1137
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:33,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't give a fuck.

1138
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:38,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Let the game come out wherever it's going to come out, and maybe I'll buy it if it's not just a copy of the first game.

1139
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:38,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1140
01:06:40,741 --> 01:06:44,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so some other stuff that's going to be interesting.

1141
01:06:45,603 --> 01:06:50,725
[SPEAKER_08]: This was kind of a surprise to me, although this is one of the only films of his I'm going to go see.

1142
01:06:51,385 --> 01:06:53,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Postal is being called...

1143
01:06:54,397 --> 01:06:54,837
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell?

1144
01:06:54,918 --> 01:06:56,579
[SPEAKER_08]: My microphone went out there for a second.

1145
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:58,321
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I turned the audio in the studio down.

1146
01:06:58,341 --> 01:06:58,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

1147
01:06:58,621 --> 01:06:58,941
[SPEAKER_08]: You're fine.

1148
01:06:59,442 --> 01:07:11,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, Postal is being called one of the best films, and apparently it got standing ovations at Cannes, which is very surprising, but I don't know.

1149
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:15,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody at the Cannes Film Festival is on ecstasy, apparently.

1150
01:07:16,137 --> 01:07:17,699
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, anyways, it says,

1151
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Uwe Boll calls it his final statement.

1152
01:07:21,065 --> 01:07:24,226
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, you can't make a more radical movie.

1153
01:07:24,566 --> 01:07:26,707
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no way you can ignore Postal.

1154
01:07:26,927 --> 01:07:31,008
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the funniest and most important films of the last decade.

1155
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,769
[SPEAKER_08]: It is one of the best films of all time.

1156
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:35,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, this is Uwe Boll talking about himself.

1157
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:37,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Were they giving it a standing ovation because they got to leave?

1158
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:38,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

1159
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:39,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1160
01:07:39,491 --> 01:07:41,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it looks cheesy.

1161
01:07:41,412 --> 01:07:42,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's going to be offensive.

1162
01:07:43,312 --> 01:07:44,733
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1163
01:07:45,825 --> 01:07:49,107
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says, or was Uebol just dreaming the whole thing?

1164
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:50,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he might have been.

1165
01:07:52,409 --> 01:07:53,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other interesting stuff.

1166
01:07:54,030 --> 01:08:00,574
[SPEAKER_08]: A game that's been announced to be coming to the Wii is called The Blob, which apparently is going to be kind of similar.

1167
01:08:02,535 --> 01:08:05,437
[SPEAKER_08]: There was actually a contest that was involved, a student project.

1168
01:08:05,897 --> 01:08:11,080
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of a cross between Katamari and, I guess, I don't know, you paint buildings with this giant blob of paint.

1169
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,234
[SPEAKER_08]: and roll it around and stuff.

1170
01:08:13,254 --> 01:08:14,054
[SPEAKER_08]: So it looks kind of neat.

1171
01:08:14,374 --> 01:08:16,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Will the game also feature a boy?

1172
01:08:16,155 --> 01:08:18,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, no.

1173
01:08:18,556 --> 01:08:19,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So it can be a boy in his blob.

1174
01:08:20,057 --> 01:08:20,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it.

1175
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:21,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I got it.

1176
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:22,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

1177
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:29,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and then real quick, um, some of the virtual console games coming out here in the next few weeks.

1178
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:31,122
[SPEAKER_08]: At least it's TurboGrafx-16 stuff.

1179
01:08:31,162 --> 01:08:32,702
[SPEAKER_08]: This ought to make Christopher happy.

1180
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:34,983
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, let's see.

1181
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:36,124
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to be Devil's Crush.

1182
01:08:36,144 --> 01:08:36,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Devil's Crush.

1183
01:08:36,924 --> 01:08:37,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew it.

1184
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:41,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Air Zonk, Drop Off, and Silent...

1185
01:08:41,696 --> 01:08:42,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Debuggers.

1186
01:08:42,437 --> 01:08:43,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the fuck is Splatterhouse?

1187
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Splatterhouse came out, I thought already.

1188
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:46,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it?

1189
01:08:46,503 --> 01:08:46,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1190
01:08:47,925 --> 01:08:48,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, shit.

1191
01:08:48,566 --> 01:08:49,607
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to go back and get it.

1192
01:08:50,268 --> 01:08:51,129
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been out for a while.

1193
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:52,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Splatterhouse kind of sucked.

1194
01:08:52,451 --> 01:08:52,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1195
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:53,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I skipped over it.

1196
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,135
[SPEAKER_08]: We had this conversation before.

1197
01:08:55,175 --> 01:08:55,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we?

1198
01:08:56,336 --> 01:08:56,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

1199
01:08:57,664 --> 01:09:07,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, if you are pre-ordering your Eternal Sonata at GameStop, you will be receiving one of these wonderful faceplates.

1200
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:09,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God, those things are gorgeous.

1201
01:09:09,787 --> 01:09:10,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, what?

1202
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:11,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see, I want to see, I want to see.

1203
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:12,348
[SPEAKER_08]: They are gorgeous.

1204
01:09:12,368 --> 01:09:16,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Receive one of five custom faceplates for Eternal Sonata for your 360.

1205
01:09:16,469 --> 01:09:18,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I never pre-order games.

1206
01:09:18,089 --> 01:09:19,350
[SPEAKER_09]: This might make me do it.

1207
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:20,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you get to pick which one, though?

1208
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:20,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1209
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:21,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess you don't know yet, huh?

1210
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:23,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are beautiful.

1211
01:09:24,691 --> 01:09:24,951
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1212
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:26,979
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1213
01:09:27,379 --> 01:09:27,739
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1214
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:30,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So now we can go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1215
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll start with Rice Princess, who's been oh so quiet tonight.

1216
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:36,243
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you for being here and for your moral support, nonetheless.

1217
01:09:36,444 --> 01:09:37,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're welcome.

1218
01:09:37,324 --> 01:09:38,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's your final thought?

1219
01:09:42,227 --> 01:09:42,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1220
01:09:43,868 --> 01:09:44,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have anything.

1221
01:09:45,388 --> 01:09:46,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Fag your anger.

1222
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:46,549
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1223
01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:46,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1224
01:09:47,209 --> 01:09:48,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what's your final thought?

1225
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:52,212
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I get a kitty this week.

1226
01:09:53,654 --> 01:09:59,298
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is now I'm craving In-N-Out Burger after watching Rice Princess stuff one down her face.

1227
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:01,399
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really want an In-N-Out Burger now.

1228
01:10:01,659 --> 01:10:03,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for making me crave that.

1229
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:04,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally welcome.

1230
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:04,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're not healthy.

1231
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:05,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1232
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:06,542
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I got it.

1233
01:10:06,962 --> 01:10:10,224

1235
01:10:12,766 --> 01:10:15,227
