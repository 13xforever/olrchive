00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,900
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, July the 1st of 2007.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,300
If you haven't heard part A of our program yet, go back to wherever you got this episode,

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,500
whether it be iTunes or Digg or wherever you got this, and look for part A

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,100
because Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two parts every week.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,900
It's the little announce in the beginning of the show told you.

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,100
So why am I repeating myself? I don't know.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,900
So let's get back to the gaming news.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,800
There's an interesting little blog post I've seen pop up on Engadget

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,700
showing someone that's modded a Wii remote with a Zapper gun from the Nintendo Entertainment System.

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,500
Now what they've done with this, and you might be wondering why the hell would they do this,

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,600
is they've actually kind of repositioned the IR sensor that's in the front of the Wii remote

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,300
to the front of the Zapper gun.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,300
And of course the trigger on the Zapper gun is now the B button for the Wii remote.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,800
So I guess you could actually use that sort of as, you know, a first person shooter controller

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,500
or something kind of like that.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
Pretty neat, I don't know.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Better than some of the stuff that's out there right now, that's for sure.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,900
Huh.

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,600
Where's Duck Hunt on Virtual Console already?

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,500
So we can really get some use out of this.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,600
I think Duck Hunt's going to be a little harder because a lot of those gun games now

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,100
it's not going to be a straight port over.

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,600
They've got to rebuild the whole thing for the Wii remote.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,100
Oh, I guess that's kind of true, huh?

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,700
You can't, well can't, I mean, because basically these games run off of emulators anyway,

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,800
so can't the Wii remote kind of emulate a light gun in the same way that some Nintendo emulators let you use your mouse?

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,000
Um, I suppose, but you know, obviously the people that make the emulators aren't exactly the people that work for Nintendo either.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Well then again, maybe if the rumors are true about this whole Dr. Mario Wii thing

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,800
and the fact that the Dr. Mario is actually a new game being made for the Wii,

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
or, well I guess you shouldn't say a new game, but you know what I mean,

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,500
like it's something you haven't seen before, a redone version of it,

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,300
um, maybe Duck Hunt can get something similar.

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,100
I hope so, because I like, uh...

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,100
I guess you kind of saw that in Wii Play a little bit in that one game.

39
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,000
I would like me some Battle Clash, and some Super Scope 6 stuff.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,200
Good times.

41
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,400
Alright, uh, the doctor in chat says,

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,300
I want some awesome 3D Duck Hunt.

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,500
That could be kind of interesting.

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,000
Shadow Charlie says, but isn't there supposed to be a Zapper adapter coming soon?

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,800
There is something that's officially going to come out at some point pretty soon.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,200
I imagine that, um, you know, because they were showing stuff at E3 last year

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,500
that looked like a shotgun kind of attachment, obviously that was, you know, more of a prototype.

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,800
I, you know, we might see something at E3.

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,100
I mean, that's when they drop bombs like that, you know,

50
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,800
hey, this is going to be coming out soon.

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,100
I still say, if this Dr. Mario Wii thing is true,

52
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,800
I think you're going to see it at E3 week.

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,900
I think that would be a nice little bombshell, you know, that whole little like,

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,700
you know, now especially that you have the downloadable content, you know,

55
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,300
and all that to push things,

56
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,000
I think you're going to see that really used this year,

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,100
because Xbox did it last year in a great way, and, you know,

58
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,500
I think, uh, Wii and Sony are hopefully going to do it as well.

59
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,400
Anyhow, uh, moving on to other Nintendo related things,

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
a lot of folks are very excited about Contra IV.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Have you seen some of the videos?

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,300
Mm-hmm.

63
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,000
Looks pretty hot.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,500
Oh, yeah.

65
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,200
I mean, it's just, it's like, okay, good, you kept what worked,

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,900
and that's just, you know, Contra, and just made a new Contra game on the DS.

67
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,900
Looks great.

68
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,300
They just don't need to mess with it anymore.

69
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,300
This is how you do it.

70
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,600
Well, just like Castlevania.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,400
Well, hopefully the game will sound great too,

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,300
and, uh, it's all going to be in the hands of Vert.

73
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,400
Vert, also known as Jake Kaufman, will be the composer for Contra IV.

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,100
Now, the reason why this is kind of cool is because Vert also founded the video game remix site, VGMix.

75
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,700
So, it's kind of interesting that he's crossing over, so to speak, with a, quote-unquote,

76
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,700
legit game, if you want to say, and he's actually going to be composing for Contra IV.

77
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,300
Pretty rad.

78
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,400
But, from what I hear, though, is he's done some legitimate games before.

79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,100
He did, um, some games actually by the developer that's making this game,

80
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,100
because they did some other games on the DS, and he's done some music for them, original stuff.

81
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,600
This is like a really high, you know, very highly anticipated A-list title, so to speak.

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,100
Oh yeah.

83
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
So, that's pretty cool.

84
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,100
Um, but not the first time the Konami has gone to the internet to find musicians.

85
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
Of course, if you follow the DDR series,

86
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,100
the UltraMix and Universe series have previously had a competition to put indie artists in the game.

87
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Yes.

88
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Um, another thing that people might be looking for,

89
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,100
I mean, granted, the classic controller is pretty good for fighting games,

90
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,100
but, you know, when you're looking for something just a little bit better and a little bit more like the arcade,

91
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,100
uh, well, you might be turning to a company like HORI,

92
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,100
and they're actually going to be releasing a fighting stick for the Wii,

93
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,100
which I imagine would be kind of hooking up to the Wii Remote, very similar to, like, the classic controller.

94
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,100
But, I mean, this is everything that you could possibly want in an arcade stick.

95
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
Um, it looks awesome.

96
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,100
Perfect for, you know, Street Fighter II Turbo, or, uh, of course, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core.

97
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,100
I was going to say, all those original Wii fighting games that the Wii doesn't have right now.

98
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
I mean, they'll have Guilty Gear soon, but, you know.

99
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Well, virtual console stuff, and this will also be good for, like, arcade games and stuff.

100
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Hey, you know what, you don't necessarily, not a lot of people really pick up these arcade sticks.

101
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
It's, you know, the people that really are into their hardcore.

102
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Fucking hardcore.

103
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
You know, games like that, so.

104
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Can I use it, uh, backwards compatible with GameCube, like, for Soul Calibur action?

105
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Uh, probably not, because, you know, this is going to be hooking up via, you know, the expansion port on the Wii Remote.

106
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,100
So, since you can't use the Wii Remote or classic controller on GameCube games, you're out of luck.

107
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:49,100
And you probably wouldn't be able to anyways, because, I mean, there's really only one, you know, directional button, or directional joystick on there, and eight buttons.

108
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,100
So, you wouldn't have all the analog sticks and stuff that the GameCube would have.

109
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Oh, well.

110
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Sorry, I was just responding to some comments in chat there.

111
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Somebody who just joined, who hasn't changed their nickname yet, says,

112
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Why can't the PSP get Contra IV? Why didn't Contra IV go to the PSP?

113
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,100
And Rama responded, because the PSP sucks ass.

114
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
And I was like, play FF1.

115
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:21,100
It doesn't suck ass, but I think that this game, you know, would work pretty good on the DS.

116
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,100
I mean, after all, Contra, you know, the first three Contra games were on, you know, the Nintendo system.

117
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:33,100
So, only fitting that, you know, Contra IV come to the DS.

118
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Well, one game that may not be coming out for the DS much longer, no, just kidding, these games sell like hotcakes,

119
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,100
but there was a brain game called Mind Quiz that came out for the Nintendo DS.

120
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,100
And the BBC is reporting that the game is actually being pulled by the manufacturer.

121
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:58,100
It was released by Ubisoft, and somebody got their panties in a bunch over a derogatory term that was used in the game.

122
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Now, the BBC article never names the term by name, but I think I speculate I figured out what it is here.

123
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,100
But basically what happened, let's see, a Belfast woman actually called the BBC

124
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:15,100
and talked to Radio Astur's Nolan show, and actually said here,

125
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,100
quote, I thought it was absolutely appalling that a word like this should be used to describe someone who has not achieved very well.

126
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Apparently, she was playing this game in the hospital right after she gave birth to her son,

127
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,100
and I guess she didn't do so well in one stage, and the game called her a derogatory name.

128
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,100
The three-year-old, by the way, to put this in perspective, her three-year-old suffered from cerebral palsy

129
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,100
and was also severely brain damaged, so she was kind of, that's not funny, why are you laughing?

130
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,100
No, I'm just thinking of what the word was, you know, not the situation, that's really sad.

131
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Yeah, I know, and the lady was very shocked because she performed poorly in this one stage,

132
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,100
and the game called her, quote, it raided her efforts in a manner derogatory to the disabled.

133
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,100
So I'm thinking the word is retarded? I guess?

134
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Which, you know, is a word, I'll admit, we do it here on the program,

135
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,100
a lot of, you know, we throw that word around sometimes and not really think about what it really means.

136
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:17,100
Well, you have to understand that we, I mean, the word retard means to slow or, you know, to, I guess,

137
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,100
I don't know, basically slow, you know, retarding something.

138
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:28,100
You know, retard your anger, you know, that was in anger management.

139
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:34,100
That's what I'm going to tell the Loki next time the subject of Apple comes up, retard your anger.

140
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,100
No, but seriously, in music you use that term.

141
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,100
That's how you use the word. It's unfortunate, it's just like, you know, what is it, fag.

142
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:48,100
You know, people, it is, you know, to describe a cigarette and stuff, but it's, you know, slang in the UK,

143
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,100
but over here, you know, we use it as, you know, what I get called.

144
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Yeah.

145
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Yes, exactly.

146
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Fag your anger, Rob.

147
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,100
Well, anyway, I really don't know what to think about this.

148
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,100
I mean, on one hand I'm like, oh, this person's overreacting and ruining the fun for the rest of us,

149
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
but at the same time you kind of go, well...

150
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Why did you buy a brain training game like that?

151
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
But I don't know, I don't know what to think.

152
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,100
I'm really looking for chatroom comments on this to see what you guys think of this story here,

153
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
because I don't know what to think.

154
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
I don't know if she's being too sensitive.

155
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,100
I don't know if, you know, maybe it is appropriate.

156
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,100
I think mine was by Ubisoft, so shame on them.

157
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
What do you think, Rice Princess?

158
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Do you have an opinion on this?

159
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Because you haven't really been talking the rest of the show otherwise,

160
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
so I'm trying to encourage you to participate.

161
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Yeah, I'm totally looking at my life journal.

162
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
I don't know, it really depends on what the word actually is.

163
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,100
I just think that they should have included that in the article.

164
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Otherwise, it could be something like, you know, I don't know, farty butt or something, you know, being the actual word.

165
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,100
I've never heard a farty butt.

166
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
You're so dumb.

167
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Oh!

168
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,100
I've never heard a farty butt be used for a derogatory term that is disabled.

169
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:07,100
I personally think it's the word Cali from Battlestar Galactica, because she's retarded.

170
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,100
But you use that word in a derogatory manner.

171
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
I do, don't I?

172
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
I do, I do.

173
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
That's not nice.

174
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
It isn't nice at all.

175
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Let's see.

176
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
I'm not a nice person.

177
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Looking at chat room, Wonder Dog Harold says,

178
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Heaven forbid the lady plays a You Don't Know Jack game and gets insulted.

179
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Rama says, You guys are a bunch of fags.

180
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Ross Steel UT says, A derogatory term for the disabled has no place in a brain training game.

181
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Dark Knight says, It's the French.

182
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
You know, Ubisoft.

183
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Girl Bakura says, Something with the word spastic.

184
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Maybe like a spaz or a, I don't know, maybe could be the word there.

185
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Let's see.

186
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Azurame says, I think she is right.

187
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,100
I work in the mental field and they could get in some serious trouble if told to the right people.

188
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Rama also says, Whatever happened to sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.

189
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Interesting.

190
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
So there you go.

191
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,100
And ACHP says, The word was spastic.

192
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,100
So maybe, that isn't, like I would, is spastic really that bad?

193
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Have I just been ignorant all these years?

194
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Ignant?

195
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Why are you so ignorant?

196
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
I don't know.

197
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Spastic I don't think is a bad term.

198
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100
I don't know.

199
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
That's stupid.

200
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
She's spastic.

201
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Fucking spaz.

202
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:37,100
This frustration leaves me with no other choice but to bring on one of our very favorite segments because I'm just left confused and unsure with what else to do at this point.

203
00:11:37,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Music.

204
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Alright, Loki start us off tonight.

205
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Fuck you to the state of California.

206
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
And why?

207
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Because driving on our local Highway 50 over here, it was nice to see that they've repaved the freeway.

208
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,100
The only problem is they forgot to paint lines on the freeway.

209
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:29,100
So there's this four lane highway that all of a sudden becomes one lane because there's no lines on it.

210
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Makes it a little unsafe.

211
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Just a little.

212
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Especially when cars are like, well, I don't know where the lane ends.

213
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
So that's kind of bad.

214
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Kind of something you should have, I don't know, done before you finish your project here.

215
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,100
At least put something that indicates where the lane ends and begins.

216
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,100
So fuck them because I know someone is going to get injured and hopefully sue for a lot of money.

217
00:12:52,100 --> 00:13:02,100
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I just put in my notice I'm going to move on August 1st today and I have no place to live lined up just yet so I'll be hitting Craigslist all next week.

218
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Or it might be an OLR live from your house.

219
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
A contest from the listeners because I'll be homeless.

220
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Wow.

221
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Pretty sad.

222
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Yeah.

223
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Rice versus.

224
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
FU to the weather because it's way too fucking hot.

225
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,100
And I don't have an air conditioner in my car because I'm po.

226
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,100
And I can't afford a luxury car.

227
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
And that's pretty much it.

228
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Yeah.

229
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
I'm sorry too.

230
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Anyhow, what are you giggling at over there, Logie?

231
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Shadow's liar.

232
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Fag your anger, Logie.

233
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Man, that's like the best word ever.

234
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
If anybody hasn't left a review on iTunes.

235
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
Oh, damn it.

236
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
They're going to block that word.

237
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
You're not going to be able to put fag in a review on iTunes.

238
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
No.

239
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Damn, because I was going to say like.

240
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Oh, that's retarded.

241
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Somebody needs to leave.

242
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
That's horrible.

243
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
I shouldn't lie.

244
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
I apologize if you were offended by that and the fact that I laughed at it.

245
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Oh, whatever.

246
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
That's your automatic gut reaction.

247
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
You don't have to apologize for who you are, Rob.

248
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,180
But I really want to see a review on iTunes that says these guys need to learn how to

249
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,100
fag their anger.

250
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Can someone make that happen?

251
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Get around the word sensor somehow.

252
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Put P-H-A-G or something.

253
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,100
I'll give you the link in iTunes if you want to go leave a review there for our chatters,

254
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
because I'm sure there's someone in there that hasn't done it.

255
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Good idea.

256
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Yeah.

257
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
There you go.

258
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,100
In sickest or insaneist in the chat says F-H-A-G, fag your anger.

259
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
I really want someone in the chat to leave that as an iTunes review.

260
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,100
These guys need to learn how to fag their anger.

261
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Anyways, so guess what?

262
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,100
There's this brand new, well it's not brand new, but a racing series coming back to consoles

263
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
exclusively to the Wii.

264
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:52,100
It's called Cruisin' and it's going to be exclusively coming to the Wii with licensed

265
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:59,100
cars and whatnot, body kits, upgrades, turbos, all that fun stuff.

266
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,100
So, Cruisin' coming to the Wii.

267
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,100
To be honest, I never was a huge fan of the Cruisin' series.

268
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
I always thought them to be kind of cheesy and stupid.

269
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,100
I seem to remember Dark Soccer as a big fan though, so she'll probably be excited about

270
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,100
this.

271
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
I played the games, they were pretty fun.

272
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Did anyone remember Rush?

273
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Yeah.

274
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
Rush 2049, San Francisco Rush?

275
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:29,100
No, I meant the last Rush game that they released that was basically, I don't remember if it

276
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,100
was Rush, I think it was just San Francisco Rush, or they redid it for the PSP and stuff.

277
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
It wasn't very good.

278
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Interesting.

279
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
So, you think this game might be a disaster as well?

280
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
I think it might be.

281
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Just what we needed in this next gen of gaming, or new gen of gaming, whatever you want to

282
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
call it, another fucking racing game.

283
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
That sucks.

284
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Even if it is a memorable one from years past.

285
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Speaking of years past, if you live over in Europe, you have some new stuff on the Virtual

286
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Console, and a very interesting pair that came out this week, Kirby's Dream Course,

287
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
which is actually a game I really enjoyed on the Super Nintendo.

288
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
I had that game.

289
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
It was a lot of fun.

290
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
It's like a little miniature golf game, but you use Kirby.

291
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
You like miniature golf games, right, Loki?

292
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
You'll have to check this out when it comes stateside.

293
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,100
But the other game was Bloody Wolf, which is a turbo graphics game there.

294
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
Bloody Wolf?

295
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100
No, it's like a war-ish game there on the Turbo Graphics 16.

296
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,100
You get Cutesy, Cutesy Kirby, and Bloody Wolf.

297
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
There you go.

298
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Kirby's Bloody Wolf.

299
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
What came out in America?

300
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,100
I totally missed it.

301
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Oh, we got the F-Zero, didn't we?

302
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
I think so.

303
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
I don't know.

304
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,100
I haven't downloaded anything from Virtual Console since Zelda II, right?

305
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Wasn't that just two weeks ago?

306
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
It wasn't that long ago.

307
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
It seems like a long time ago.

308
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
There you go.

309
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
Well, some other stuff you're going to be able to download soon.

310
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,100
I don't know why this is a news story, because I always thought this was still on there in

311
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,100
the first place.

312
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Also a reminder, if you haven't downloaded the Internet channel yet, you're now going

313
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
to have to pay for it.

314
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
So screw you guys, not that it's any good.

315
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Not that we do have a... we don't have an O-L-O-V site, because I never made one.

316
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Because you're lazy.

317
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Because I'm lazy.

318
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,100
But anyways, there's going to be a brand new service coming to have original downloadable

319
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
titles called WiiWare.

320
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:21,100
And if I remember correctly, that's already online with I think the Internet channel,

321
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,100
and also the Wii Vote channel.

322
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,100
It's called WiiWare.

323
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,100
And hypothetically, this is Dr. Mario Wii, right?

324
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Hypothetically.

325
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
2 plus 2 equals 4.

326
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,600
This, I'm not sure if it's going to be a brand new channel, but currently online right now

327
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,100
they do have a section for WiiWare.

328
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,800
It's been there forever.

329
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,480
But they just want you to remember that there is going to be a WiiWare service that's going

330
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,580
to be kind of like Xbox Live Arcade or the PlayStation 3 PSN networks.

331
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,180
So I don't know, going to be seeing some original titles, which will be cool.

332
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:56,260
And I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to find out what exactly is coming there first.

333
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,820
Obviously we're thinking Dr. Mario Wii.

334
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,300
I haven't checked the Everybody Votes channel in weeks.

335
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,900
Did they ever use the question I submitted to them?

336
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
I don't know.

337
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,100
The last one I saw was thank you or hello.

338
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,420
No, the question I submitted was which is funnier, clowns or rape?

339
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,700
I don't know if they used that though.

340
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,540
I'm thinking they probably didn't because I probably would have heard something about

341
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
it.

342
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,620
They probably would have made the gaming blog news.

343
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,420
Also making the gaming blog news this week is the launch of 3Speech because everybody

344
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,960
and their fucking mom has to have a podcast.

345
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,600
And so Sony started one.

346
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,460
They have the 3Speech podcast.

347
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,060
And what did they do in their first podcast?

348
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,100
It might not have been the first episode, but definitely they're still early on in their

349
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
podcasting life.

350
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,660
They've taken a shot at Major Nelson.

351
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,900
What's interesting though is that upon reviews of the new 3Speech podcast, 3Speech doesn't

352
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,860
really let you know that they work for Sony where Major Nelson kind of makes it no secret.

353
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,480
He does work for Microsoft.

354
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,180
But the interesting thing about Major Nelson, he'll say nice things about the Wii once in

355
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,500
a while and even PlayStation 3 if they deserve it.

356
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,620
So there you go.

357
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,820
And sorry, I laughed because I'm reading chat here.

358
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:16,580
Wonder Dog Herald suggests everybody votes question, which do you prefer, cock or vag?

359
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,300
I'm sure that will get through.

360
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,300
They're dinner meats.

361
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Anyhow.

362
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
What the hell?

363
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
Oh, they're dinner meats.

364
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:29,100
Great way to cover that up there.

365
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
You know what?

366
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Forget the other story.

367
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,100
It's just a story about Sony making fun of Major Nelson.

368
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Who cares?

369
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Seriously.

370
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Keep talking about that.

371
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,740
I'm seriously reading this going, who cares?

372
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,420
They refer to Major Nelson as the unnamed blogger.

373
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,060
Oh my God!

374
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
No!

375
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,260
Why do they say he's unnamed?

376
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,700
He clearly has a name.

377
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
Major Nelson.

378
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,660
That is just pure falsity.

379
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,980
That's right.

380
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,780
I made up a word, falsity.

381
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
I don't really care.

382
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,460
I've listened to Major Nelson once.

383
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
Not that I have anything against the guy.

384
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,660
I just don't have time to listen to him.

385
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,780
The three speech podcast I'll probably never listen to.

386
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
So you know what?

387
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,780
You know what?

388
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
Listen to this podcast.

389
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
This is all you need.

390
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:19,660
Major spoiler alert here, but I hear that the next three speech podcast calls Leo Laporte's

391
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:32,480
spastic and then the next one they tell Reggie if he's made of faggot's anger.

392
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,020
This is kind of interesting actually.

393
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,340
We've been seeing a lot of these weird third party adapters and stuff come out for the

394
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,540
360.

395
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:47,940
This one though is being created by XMN and that's a mod company and they're actually

396
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,900
creating an HDMI cable for the regular non-elite 360s.

397
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,220
No word yet on how exactly it's going to work, but apparently it's going to allow you to

398
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:06,900
use HDMI cables obviously for 1080p on systems that may not be black and supporting a HDMI

399
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,980
out on it.

400
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,460
So the speculation I believe is that it's going to be something that has to do with

401
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,780
the VGA cable maybe converting the signal over to work on HDMI.

402
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,040
I don't know, but it should be interesting to see.

403
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:30,260
So if you want to keep an eye on that, check out xcm.cc and they have all the information

404
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,060
on that.

405
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,940
Alright, now why would I want to get an HDMI cable?

406
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,460
Is it really that big a difference?

407
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,940
I don't think it's a big difference.

408
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,900
It's really if you want that kind of cable for your console.

409
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:52,540
I think they're maybe worried that later on when they start using the broadcast flag and

410
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,780
stuff that you might need an HDMI cable.

411
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,020
Although I would think though if you're using this converter it's not going to work anyways.

412
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
I don't know.

413
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,180
It's not anything that I think you need, but whatever.

414
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,180
Interesting.

415
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,860
Also, on the Xbox 360 something you can see in this lovely new HDMI would be some of the

416
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,460
new achievements in the NCAA Football 08.

417
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,180
Now there's an achievement list and what's kind of interesting about it is that there's

418
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,580
actually some product placement in the achievement list.

419
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,020
They even use for the little icons for the achievement like Pontiac and Old Spice.

420
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,260
They're like actual official logos there.

421
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,140
I'm trying to look at what some of these are actually called, some of these achievements.

422
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,540
You can get the list for yourself at xbox360achievements.org.

423
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
Let's see.

424
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
There it is, yeah.

425
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,180
Old Spice Red Zone Perfection.

426
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,580
Eat a Play Now or Dynasty Mode Game with Red Zone Efficiency Rating of 100%.

427
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,580
You get 15 gamer points for that.

428
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,420
Pontiac 4th Quarter Comeback with a little Pontiac logo.

429
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,300
Win a Play Now or Dynasty Mode Game.

430
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,740
Win down by 14 to start the 4th Quarter.

431
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,300
You know, I don't understand, but yet still with all these corporate sponsorships and

432
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,220
now they're going to throw their logos into my achievements list, these games are still

433
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
$60.

434
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,620
It's because EA is a fucking whore when it comes to advertising in game and stuff like

435
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
that.

436
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,300
And Transformers is another game with big Heliosigns.

437
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:18,820
In fact, there's achievements that involve using the Heliophone sign to kill one of the

438
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,820
drones in the game.

439
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,180
You get an achievement for that.

440
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:27,140
So it's not anything relatively new, but I don't know.

441
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,060
And Solid Goomba in chat says, remember the Fight Night achievements?

442
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,300
There was like a Burger King match and all that stuff.

443
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,120
But the interesting thing about that, I mean, yeah, it hasn't happened in a while though

444
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,660
and the interesting thing about this is that these achievements actually have the company's

445
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,720
logos in them.

446
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,780
And remember that these things will show up on your gamer thing in the Xbox and when you

447
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,660
look on the internet and all that crap.

448
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,460
So it's just kind of interesting.

449
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,740
It's going to filthy up your profile with corporate logos.

450
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,780
Well, not a problem for me because I hate sports games, but I'm going to tell you this

451
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
much.

452
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,780
But you love achievements.

453
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,700
I do like achievements, but I'm not going to buy a product because I see a fucking logo

454
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
for it.

455
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,060
If it wasn't that easy, then these people would be making billions upon billions of

456
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,020
dollars just when having their logo out there.

457
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,460
You don't automatically go...

458
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,660
Well, they obviously pay for this because it works.

459
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
It's like product recognition.

460
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Like, I don't know.

461
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,380
Maybe somebody sees the little old Spice logo and goes, oh yeah, I need to pick up some

462
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,380
deodorant.

463
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
I'll get that.

464
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,380
And then that's like in their mind.

465
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
I don't know.

466
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,380
I don't know.

467
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,820
But whatever.

468
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,020
That is kind of ridiculous, but one thing that is pretty awesome.

469
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,020
It's going to be Destroy All Humans 3.

470
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:40,060
It's coming out soon, and it's going to be finally making its way to Playstation 3, the

471
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,480
360, and the Wii.

472
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,740
No word exactly on what exactly is going to be in the game.

473
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,380
Obviously, it's probably going to be shown at E3, but Destroy All Humans is fucking awesome.

474
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
That's all I need to say.

475
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,280
There's a perfect example of a game that's fun because you get to blow up things and

476
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,980
throw cows.

477
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,020
I knew you would like this news.

478
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
I love the game.

479
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,180
You can pick up a cow with your tractor beam and then hunt it.

480
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,460
I notice there's a theme here.

481
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,540
You like these games where you get to play as aliens and do things to humans.

482
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
Not necessarily.

483
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,900
I like Grand Theft Auto.

484
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,420
I like sandbox games.

485
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,420
Fair enough.

486
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,640
So that's what's fun.

487
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,100
So continuing our conversation from part A a long time ago, fun to you is the sandbox

488
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,140
type of games where you can do whatever the fuck you want.

489
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,140
Games where you can do whatever the fuck you want, and usually if the game sucks, like

490
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,480
Driver 3, there will be things that you find in the game that are fun to do, like mess

491
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,860
with the AI and stuff, or make your own instant replays that are ridiculous.

492
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:46,740
Another very popular series that a lot of people like is Geometry Wars Galaxies, but

493
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,300
people are looking forward to Geometry War Galaxies because they like the old school

494
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
one.

495
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,480
GameSpot put up a video this week.

496
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,660
It was a demo of the upcoming Wii title, Geometry Wars Galaxies.

497
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,140
What kind of caused some people to turn around and go, huh?

498
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,300
Is that during the demo, the developer actually pauses the game and the word achievements

499
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,700
comes up.

500
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:13,620
So the question comes up, is this game actually secretly being developed for Xbox 360 as well?

501
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Or are there achievements coming to the Wii?

502
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,260
Or is it because the game is early in development and it's a port and they just haven't gotten

503
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
rid of that yet?

504
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,500
I mean, there's a million different theories, but it certainly has made some people go,

505
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
huh?

506
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:31,700
Well, I think it doesn't have to have the achievement system from the 360 in order to

507
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,700
have achievements.

508
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
I mean, look at Resistance.

509
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,980
Resistance has achievements in it, but it's just for the game.

510
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980
It's not anything...

511
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,980
Like internal achievements.

512
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,980
Exactly.

513
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,900
It's just for unlocking bonus content and stuff like that.

514
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
It's not necessarily...

515
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:48,220
EA has that even on the 360, like the Burnout games, you get those stupid trophies for everything

516
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,220
you do.

517
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,220
Yeah, exactly.

518
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,220
You hit the gas pedal.

519
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
You get a trophy.

520
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,220
Exactly.

521
00:26:54,220 --> 00:27:01,180
Another interesting thing, though, coming from Geometry Wars Galaxies is they're going

522
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,060
to have download play in there as well.

523
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,860
So if you own the DS version of the game, you can actually transfer over and download

524
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:13,060
play a full version of Geometry Wars Retro Evolved onto other stuff.

525
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,020
Also, if you have the Wii version, you can transfer over a full version of Geometry Wars

526
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,100
Retro Evolved onto the DS.

527
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,260
So it's going to have cross-platform play that way.

528
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
It's kind of neat.

529
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260
Huh.

530
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
All right.

531
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
That should be fun.

532
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,260
That's kind of interesting.

533
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Wait.

534
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
So you're going to be able to download it to the DS if you have the Wii one?

535
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
Yeah.

536
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,860
If you have the Wii one, you'll be able to download a playable version onto the DS.

537
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,180
That's great, because this is a great trend that we're seeing here now that you're going

538
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
to be able...

539
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,940
And a lot of us theorized this was coming, that the DS and the Wii were going to be able

540
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
to work together like that.

541
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,420
I don't know why they don't have it before.

542
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:55,620
However, with the GameCube, Metroid Prime 2, you can download the original Metroid.

543
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,900
The Animal Crossing island is the thing I always think of.

544
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,420
Remember in Animal Crossing you could go to the island on the Game Boy?

545
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,420
It was awesome.

546
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,860
Awesome.

547
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:09,540
Now another thing that's super awesome, and that's because it's Grand Theft Auto IV, the

548
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,820
brand new trailer came out.

549
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
It looks pretty cool.

550
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,620
They didn't show a whole lot in there, but definitely going to be an awesome game.

551
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,700
The graphics looked a little bit scaled down from what they were before.

552
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,580
Obviously though, they're probably tweaking it to make sure that the frame rate is good,

553
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:33,700
but they did show some gunfights and of course car chases and all that fun stuff.

554
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,460
Just more of a tease right now, and I'm sure there's going to be a new trailer coming out

555
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,220
about once a month or so, especially with E3 right around the corner.

556
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,100
You know there's going to be something that they're going to be teasing at least.

557
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,620
Only a few months away now.

558
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,260
All right, so are you still very excited about this?

559
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,380
Was there any kind of revelations that the trailer had for you, or was it just more like

560
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,380
mouth-wetting?

561
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
It was just mouth-wetting.

562
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:05,140
They did show the main character, Nico, actually holding onto the back of a truck, being held

563
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,940
onto that, and then also hanging from a helicopter, which looked pretty cool.

564
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,360
So I don't know, it looks awesome.

565
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,260
I think once we see this game in action, it's just going to be phenomenal.

566
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:23,220
And I have the collector's edition on order, because I have to have all that crap that

567
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,220
comes with it.

568
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,580
All right, well we're going to get into another segment here, and we're going to go from something

569
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,980
very, very new to a classic segment on Orange Lounge Radio.

570
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,020
It's a game we like to play, especially during Slow News Week, such as this one called Beat

571
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,380
the Host.

572
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,500
And tonight on Beat the Host, we're going to be looking for a contestant to call us

573
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,880
on our Skype line.

574
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,700
Go ahead and call now if you'd like to play.

575
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,040
However, for tonight's Beat the Host, you should know, retro knowledge is really going

576
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,260
to help tonight.

577
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:59,600
So 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to play, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

578
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,260
So go ahead and give us a call right now, and we will take the first person to call

579
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,540
in on our Skype line.

580
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,060
And the way it's going to work, we're going to change up the rules again a little bit

581
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,060
tonight.

582
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:14,100
But it is going to have to do with identifying game music or game noise, and I will let you

583
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,500
know a little more about that when we get into the game.

584
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,540
All right, we're starting to get some calls on the line.

585
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
Let's go to a call.

586
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

587
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
Who's this?

588
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,180
Hey, it's Ronma.

589
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Hi, Ronma.

590
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Finally.

591
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,180
Hi, Arnie.

592
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,860
Finally, a normal sounding call.

593
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,460
All right, we have our contestant.

594
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
Stop calling everybody.

595
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,620
Stop calling everybody.

596
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,980
You guys can call later when we open up the Skype line for calls.

597
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,700
Ronma, you ready to play some Beat the Host?

598
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
Yeah.

599
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,900
All right, tonight you get to challenge Loki.

600
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,420
He's the only one because I already know the questions, and well, Irene, you would just

601
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,220
whoop her ass, I mean, no matter what the game is.

602
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
Wait, what is the topic?

603
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,180
The topic is Atari 2600 games.

604
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,060
Oh, yeah, pick Matt.

605
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,100
All right, so Matt, in part A, you may remember, seemed to be-

606
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
I know, I am-

607
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,140
He flaunted his Atari 2600 knowledge.

608
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,220
I just like playing Atari 2600.

609
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,740
It doesn't mean I played everything.

610
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,740
I like combat.

611
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
This is going to be tough tonight.

612
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,420
Because it's so tough, we're going to change up the rules of Beat the Host a little bit

613
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,180
tonight because you know every time we play Beat the Host, we change the rules.

614
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,180
Okay, Ronma?

615
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Yeah.

616
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,540
Okay, so what we're going to do, I'm going to need you to speak nice and loud or I might

617
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,140
not hear you over the game music, okay?

618
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,140
All right, hold on.

619
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,620
Let me- I'm going to leave the chat room.

620
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,500
All right, yes, you need to leave the chat room.

621
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
That's good.

622
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
That's very ethical of you.

623
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I appreciate that.

624
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
All right.

625
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,780
Now, what's going to happen is that we're going to play some music from Atari 2600 games.

626
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,420
I actually recorded myself playing some Atari 2600 games earlier today, and you're going

627
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,740
to hear some music from it.

628
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,420
The first one of you guys to shout out the correct answer gets a point, okay?

629
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
Got it.

630
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,360
Now, in order to help you out, because Atari 2600 tracks were kind of vague, I will give

631
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,180
you some hints at certain time intervals to help you guys out and hopefully one of you

632
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,740
guys actually gets the right answer, okay?

633
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,740
All right.

634
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
Cool.

635
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
All right.

636
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
You ready, Ronma?

637
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,740
I'm ready.

638
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Is that as loud as you get, Ronma?

639
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
Are you able to get any louder?

640
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
Hold on.

641
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,900
How's that?

642
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,900
Much better.

643
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
All right.

644
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,900
Because we're really going to have to strain to hear you over these songs.

645
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,900
Okay, here we go.

646
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
You ready, Ronma?

647
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
Ready.

648
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
All right.

649
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,900
Beat the host.

650
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:19,820
Here's song, or I should say game number one.

651
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:29,020
It's based on a vector arcade game, but the Atari 2600 couldn't support vector graphics.

652
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,020
Yars revenge?

653
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,860
No.

654
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,860
If there was no separate hyperspace button, you use this by pulling the joystick down.

655
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Galaxian?

656
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,860
No.

657
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,860
Can I answer?

658
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,860
No.

659
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,340
When you shoot a rock, it splits into two smaller rocks.

660
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
Asteroids.

661
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
Asteroids.

662
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,340
Loki got it first.

663
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
Loki gets a point.

664
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Good job, Loki.

665
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
Good job.

666
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
Yay.

667
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,340
All right.

668
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,340
One point for Loki.

669
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
That was asteroids.

670
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
I just didn't remember the part.

671
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
All right.

672
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,340
All right.

673
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
Here we go.

674
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
You ready for number two, Ronma?

675
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Yeah.

676
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,620
If you can get it like three seconds sooner next time, you'll be good.

677
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,620
No problem.

678
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
All right.

679
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,900
Here's song, or game number two.

680
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,900
Combat.

681
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,220
Loki got it without even a hint.

682
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:25,220
I knew he'd get it when he said he'd played all those combat back in the day.

683
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,380
You're not looking at my computer screen, right?

684
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,820
I can't see anything on your computer screen.

685
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
That was combat.

686
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,820
Good job.

687
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,260
That was the default packing game for the Atari 2600, by the way.

688
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,260
All right.

689
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
Here we go.

690
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
You ready for number three, Ronma?

691
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
Yeah.

692
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,260
You can do it.

693
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,260
Come on.

694
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,260
You're losing two nothing.

695
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Let's see what we can do.

696
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
It's on command.

697
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
No.

698
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
Tempest.

699
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,260
Nope.

700
00:33:47,260 --> 00:34:01,260
There's a version of this on Xbox Live.

701
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:10,460
Centipede, millipede.

702
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,020
Pressing the button flapped your wings.

703
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,540
Yars event.

704
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
No.

705
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Joust.

706
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,620
Oh, you got it.

707
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,620
Good job.

708
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,300
It was joust.

709
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
Nice job.

710
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
It was joust.

711
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
All right.

712
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Three nothing, Ronma.

713
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,620
You're killing me here.

714
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,340
Sorry, dude.

715
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
It's all right.

716
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,340
I still love you, man.

717
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
All right.

718
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
Here we go.

719
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,340
Now, this one is a tricky one.

720
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
I'm going to tell you straight up.

721
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
This one is fucking hard, all right?

722
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,340
So here we go.

723
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:52,180
If either of you get this, I will be very impressed.

724
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,780
Evil Otto was a character that would chase you.

725
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,780
Robotron?

726
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:09,220
Some people know this game from the big happy face bouncing creature that would stalk you.

727
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,220
That's Evil Otto.

728
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,620
Frenzy.

729
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,220
No.

730
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,700
Damn it.

731
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,700
You shot robots in a maze.

732
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Robotron 20.

733
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
No.

734
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
10 seconds.

735
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,900
Evil Otto, big happy face bouncing creature.

736
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Robots in a maze.

737
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Galaxian?

738
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Oh.

739
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,900
Oh.

740
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
I don't know.

741
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
Berserk.

742
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
Berserk is a game.

743
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Berserk.

744
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,900
You know, I actually had the board game to that.

745
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,900
You what?

746
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,980
I actually had the board game to that like a very long time ago.

747
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,100
Oh, good.

748
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,420
You know, and oh well.

749
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,420
It happens.

750
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,420
Brain fart.

751
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,500
Frenzy is just like that game too.

752
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,420
Good job in the chat room though.

753
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,420
Some folks there got Berserk.

754
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,020
Some folks were saying it was Sword Quest, which was a really good guess, but unfortunately

755
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
not right.

756
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,780
All right, this next one's a toughie too, and I'll also be impressed if either of you

757
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:14,980
get this.

758
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:43,940
In this game, you are out to rescue Lady P. Lady P is being held by a jungle tribe.

759
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:49,380
You start this game swinging from rope to rope, then you fight crocodiles, then you

760
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,380
dodge falling rocks.

761
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
Can I please answer?

762
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,380
Nope.

763
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,380
This wasn't Kongo Bongo.

764
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,380
No.

765
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
Um.

766
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
Rama, you still with us?

767
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,380
Yeah, sure.

768
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,380
I know what the game is.

769
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,380
I just can't remember the title.

770
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,980
It's not Donkey Kong Jr., is it?

771
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:09,540
Ten seconds, no.

772
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:15,740
Lady P, jungle tribe, swinging ropes, fighting crocodiles, dodging falling rocks.

773
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,980
You do all that in Jungle Hunt.

774
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,980
Jungle Hunt.

775
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
All right.

776
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Still three nothing in Loki's favor.

777
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,980
You can still win it though.

778
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Okay.

779
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
All right.

780
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
I got an easier one for you this time.

781
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
All right.

782
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
You ready?

783
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Ready.

784
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
Here.

785
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,980
Here we go.

786
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
Pac-Man.

787
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,980
Oh my God.

788
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
That was fast.

789
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,720
He knew it right from the starting tone there.

790
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,700
It was Pac-Man.

791
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:44,220
Let's play a little more of that because I barely got to hear any of it.

792
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
Remember little ghost chasing noises?

793
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,620
Now here we go.

794
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,100
Yeah, there it is.

795
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,260
Based on a very popular arcade game, but it was considered a disappointment, the home

796
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
version.

797
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,620
I have a poster for this at my work.

798
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,940
You eat a wafer for bonus points in Pac-Man.

799
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,940
Look at that.

800
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,940
Damn.

801
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,940
All right.

802
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,940
That's all right.

803
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,980
There's four left.

804
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,460
So Rama, you can still tie it up.

805
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
Working on it.

806
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
All right.

807
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
It's all right, Rama.

808
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,460
It was a long time ago.

809
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,660
I barely remember these when I was playing through them today.

810
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,660
All right.

811
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Now this one is fun.

812
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,860
This one's a tricky one, but I love this game.

813
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,500
Burger time.

814
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
No.

815
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Popeye.

816
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:34,980
Oh, Rama gets one.

817
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
That's right.

818
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,980
That's right.

819
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
It sounded familiar.

820
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
That's right.

821
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,060
Of course, you can kind of hear a little theme being used in the game.

822
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,180
There was a movie out around the same time, and remember, this was a really cool game

823
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,300
at the time because the stages were so unique, and in that first stage that you were hearing,

824
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,500
olive oil was actually throwing hearts down that you had to catch before they sank in

825
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
the water.

826
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,700
Rama is on the board.

827
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,700
Good job, Rama.

828
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,580
See, now you don't get shut out, and that feels good.

829
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,580
So all right.

830
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Yeah.

831
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
All right.

832
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
Well, keep it up, Rama.

833
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,580
All right.

834
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
Let's do the next one.

835
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Three left.

836
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,580
Here we go.

837
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:20,700
I need a more specific answer.

838
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,940
Pitfall 2.

839
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,900
Yes, it's Pitfall 2.

840
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
Oh.

841
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,380
Oh, poor Rama.

842
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,820
It is Pitfall 2.

843
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,900
It was one of the first games to feature a full soundtrack.

844
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,420
The sequel to another popular Atari game in the main character was Pitfall Harry.

845
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,140
Rama so close.

846
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,140
You know what?

847
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,340
Just because Loki pisses me off sometimes, I'm going to give that to you anyway.

848
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
We're going to give it to you.

849
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,340
All right.

850
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
All right.

851
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,340
So there we go.

852
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,340
So what do we have?

853
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
Four for Loki.

854
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,340
Two for Rama.

855
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,340
All right.

856
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Here we go.

857
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
Let's go to another one.

858
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,340
This one is also very hard.

859
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,340
Here we go.

860
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,340
Bump and jump.

861
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,340
Bump and jump.

862
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:07,500
No.

863
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,980
This game was also based on a popular movie series.

864
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,980
Star Trek?

865
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
No.

866
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
Star Wars?

867
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Nope.

868
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,980
DC?

869
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Nope.

870
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:25,340
You can walk into a phone booth to change from one character to another.

871
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
Superman?

872
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,340
Yes.

873
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,340
Rama got it.

874
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,340
It was Superman.

875
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
Ah.

876
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,340
Remember the Superman game?

877
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,340
No.

878
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,340
It was great.

879
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,660
It was so weird because like you could fly up and you would fly into another screen.

880
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,220
Like you moved up, down, left, and right.

881
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,220
Like it was weird.

882
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
It was very weird.

883
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,220
There you go.

884
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,220
Rama's got three now.

885
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,220
Well, because you gave him one.

886
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,220
Yeah, I did.

887
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,220
I totally gave him one.

888
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,220
All right.

889
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,220
That's all right.

890
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,220
Let's see if you can tie it up, Rama.

891
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,220
This is the last one.

892
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
All right.

893
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,220
And this is a doozy.

894
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,420
This is a hell of a game.

895
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,420
Here we go.

896
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,420
Ms. Pac-Man.

897
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,420
No.

898
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,420
Pac-Man 2.

899
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,100
No.

900
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,420
This game was made by Mystique Entertainment.

901
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,420
Adventure?

902
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,420
No.

903
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,420
No.

904
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:25,420
It's a highly controversial game that shows up on lots of gag Atari 2600 lists.

905
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
Custer's Revenge.

906
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,420
Ah.

907
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,420
Good job, Loki.

908
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,420
It is Custer's Revenge.

909
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,060
And, of course, the object of the game, your naked ass has to fuck an Indian girl lots

910
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,060
and lots.

911
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,060
And that's why the game is very controversial.

912
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,060
You were just playing that earlier.

913
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
Yeah.

914
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,060
That's when I was recording the clips.

915
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
Oh my God.

916
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,060
That was so funny.

917
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,060
That's why you couldn't play because you walked in here when I was setting it up.

918
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,060
Oh, yeah.

919
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,060
All right.

920
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,060
You got the score.

921
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:52,380
Rama, you got three points, a very good showing, and, unfortunately, Loki beat you with five,

922
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,580
so, unfortunately, you got beat by the host tonight, but you made a damn good effort on

923
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,580
a very tough topic.

924
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,580
Thanks, man.

925
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,580
I appreciate it.

926
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,820
No problemo.

927
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,300
Take any shout-outs or plugs you want to give, as long as we have you on the air as a consolation

928
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
prize.

929
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,660
Visit my website, www.djromas.net.

930
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,660
There you go.

931
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,660
Take us from Bonneville 7RL.

932
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,660
All right.

933
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,660
Sounds good.

934
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,660
Thanks, Rama.

935
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Take care.

936
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,660
All right.

937
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,060
Now, the audio looked a little low to me on the board here, but it seems like the chat

938
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,220
room was able to play along just fine, so I'm hoping the audio was just fine there as

939
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,540
far as things went.

940
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,820
Otherwise, I'll have to fix that in post-production.

941
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,820
We'll see.

942
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,820
I think we're good, though.

943
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,500
Live radio, boys and girls.

944
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,060
Take it or leave it.

945
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,580
We're going to go back into some gaming news.

946
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,580
Let's talk about the game Turrican.

947
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,620
This is a game that was on the Commodore 64, kind of compared to an earlier version of

948
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,820
Metroid slash Contra.

949
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:54,140
Turrican was a game that was made for the Commodore 64, however, a German programmer

950
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,980
has made a freeware remake of the game.

951
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:05,340
It's called Hurrican, and you can download Hurrican from the site, Hurrican-game.de,

952
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,340
because it's German.

953
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,480
It's a 40-megabyte game.

954
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,780
It's Windows-compatible, and if you remember gaming on the Commodore 64, you're probably

955
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,540
going to love this, so check it out, Hurrican.

956
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,220
Another game that's getting a sequel, and it's long due, I think, and this is, I guess,

957
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:27,540
a rumor for right now, but Parasite Eve is slated on possibly coming out to the PlayStation

958
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:36,820
3 and 360, and no word exactly on any details on that, but I don't know.

959
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,500
I guess people are thinking, because they originally announced Parasite Eve 3 as a mobile

960
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,220
game, but they're thinking this is going to be something else.

961
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:52,900
This is also, I guess, Quarterman from EGM is saying that they're going to be, Dio Kojima

962
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,660
is going to be working on another PS3 exclusive title.

963
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,820
No word on what that is.

964
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:06,660
People are thinking maybe Zone of Enders or something like that.

965
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,380
That's pretty much it.

966
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,500
Well I would hope Parasite Eve is actually going to get the full-blown next-gen treatment,

967
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,940
not just some shitty cell phone game.

968
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,940
I hope so.

969
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,420
Weren't you a fan of Parasite Eve, Rice Princess?

970
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,580
I still remember you were the person that introduced me to that.

971
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,580
I was?

972
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,580
Or I'm smoking crack.

973
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,580
Maybe I'm smoking crack.

974
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,020
I thought it was a good game.

975
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,280
I never actually beat it, but I played through a good part of it.

976
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,820
That was me in most Final Fantasy games.

977
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,300
I like the combat system in that.

978
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,500
The combat system in the first Parasite Eve reminds me much of what they're doing in Final

979
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,820
Fantasy XII right now, how that system, you have a big dome or whatever that you can attack

980
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,820
in and stuff.

981
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,000
It reminds me very much of that.

982
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,960
Well before we get to the Skype line, I've got one more story for you guys.

983
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,860
Since it is July 1st, also known as Canada Day, I thought those you Canadians would appreciate

984
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,900
this.

985
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,860
You can get a red PlayStation 3 and it's a special Canada event.

986
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,060
You can only get this in Canada.

987
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,060
It's actually a contest that's being held.

988
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:09,740
The contest is being run through July 15th at PlayStation.ca and you can actually win

989
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:16,020
yourself a red PlayStation 3 or a limited edition Canada PlayStation 3 t-shirt there.

990
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,140
It doesn't have the maple leaf on it, but it has a 3 in place of the maple leaf.

991
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,860
Otherwise it kind of looks like the Canadian flag.

992
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,180
So there you go.

993
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,700
Only 3 of those red PlayStation 3s by the way will be made.

994
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,940
So that's kind of neat.

995
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:33,020
Well technically 4 since there's already been a red PlayStation 3 out there custom made.

996
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,020
Well that's different though.

997
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,100
It's kind of officially endorsed so to speak by Sony.

998
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,960
So I know we have some Canadian listeners there so you might want to go enter that contest

999
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,840
and brag to all your friends, eh?

1000
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,120
This is completely random, but I feel that we should talk about this real quick.

1001
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,580
We went over the fries the other day because I had my motherboard.

1002
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,580
There's a fan that went out.

1003
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,660
My computer is kind of on the fritz.

1004
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,660
But Nelly picked up this USB stripper.

1005
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,840
It's on a stripping pole that you can buy.

1006
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,460
I've seen that before because we were thinking about getting it for her for her birthday

1007
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,500
before we realized we were all freaking poor.

1008
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,340
I thought that was funny.

1009
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,340
I don't know.

1010
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,340
That was great.

1011
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,340
Did you guys actually see it in motion or what?

1012
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:16,860
No, but we almost bought it and then like common sense kicked in and we said no we probably

1013
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,820
don't need a $30 USB stripper.

1014
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,820
Why not?

1015
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,820
I don't know.

1016
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:28,420
Because she wanted to take it to work and you know her work wouldn't really think too

1017
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,420
highly of that.

1018
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,900
All right, well we're going to open up the Skype line.

1019
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:41,500
If you'd like to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can call us on the actual program Skype.

1020
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,340
Orange Lounge Radio is our username.

1021
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,580
We always like to hear from our listeners and get your guys' two cents on what's going

1022
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,540
on in the gaming scene and the gaming community.

1023
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,440
If you have any feedback to tonight's articles or what have you or you just want to tell

1024
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,500
Rice Princess to say hi to you and actually talk on the program tonight, all of that you

1025
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,140
can do by calling our program.

1026
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,900
So while we wait for some calls because there's a little bit of a lag, do you have any last

1027
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,900
minute stories?

1028
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,900
No.

1029
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,900
No?

1030
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,900
No last minute stories tonight?

1031
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,900
Not at the moment.

1032
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,900
Oh my gosh.

1033
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,900
It really is a slow gaming week.

1034
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:15,580
I was looking for stuff but I haven't seen anything.

1035
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,780
Well should I pick up Project Silpheed?

1036
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,540
I haven't, I saw it scroll by your screen there and I'm curious about that game but

1037
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,540
I don't know.

1038
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,540
It looks okay.

1039
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,700
I want to get this t-shirt.

1040
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:30,140
It looks like one of those Target t-shirts, like the Don't Bother Me ones and it says

1041
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:39,620
good and it has the male, female, almost looks like a restroom logo or something and that's

1042
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:44,000
good and then better has a guy with two girls and then best shows a guy playing a video

1043
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
game.

1044
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,300
We're finally getting calls, thank God.

1045
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,940
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

1046
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,940
Hello you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

1047
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:55,940
Oh damn it, it didn't work.

1048
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,940
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lawn's Radio.

1049
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,940
Wow.

1050
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:14,860
If you always want to test your Skype line, you can do that by calling Echo 1-2-3.

1051
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,860
This is a username on Skype if you'd always like to test your connection in advance which

1052
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,860
we highly recommend.

1053
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,860
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

1054
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,860
Hey it's DJ Tyrant.

1055
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,860
Hey!

1056
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,860
What's up DJ Tyrant, how are you doing?

1057
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,860
Whoa.

1058
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:32,220
Hey I'm doing pretty good, I'm at Anime Expo 2007 right now.

1059
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,220
Awesome, how's Anime?

1060
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,140
Now you actually got into Anime Expo 2007 on behalf of Orange Lawn's Radio right?

1061
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,420
Yes I did.

1062
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,940
Alright, then you better have a good report for us, what's going on at Anime Expo?

1063
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:52,340
Uh, lots of anime and stuff, there's actually a lot of gaming stuff also, what did I check

1064
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,340
out today?

1065
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,300
I checked out the Naruto fighting game for the Wii, those are a little sloppy for that

1066
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
though.

1067
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,180
Oh, wait, what was sloppy, the controls are sloppy?

1068
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,180
Yeah.

1069
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,180
Oh that sucks.

1070
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:11,780
But um, there's Guilty Gear, the U1XX, forget the subtitle for that, but.

1071
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,780
Accent Core.

1072
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,260
Look, he says it's Accent Core.

1073
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,260
Yeah, that sounds right.

1074
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:22,460
I didn't get to play it, but it looked pretty solid.

1075
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:27,100
Interesting, so I don't usually go to Anime Expos where there's a lot of game presence

1076
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,180
there, but it sounds like a few game companies are making their way out to Anime Expo to

1077
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,180
plug their stuff?

1078
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:37,980
Yeah, they are, apparently Square has a bunch of stuff for Oven, I didn't get to swing by

1079
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,820
their booth because I don't play Oven, but I saw a lot of people with stuff from Final

1080
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,820
Fantasy 11.

1081
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,940
Oh my god, that was like E3 a couple years ago, we did nothing but play at the Square

1082
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,940
booth on their Final Fantasy 11 events, that was when I was sadly sadly addicted.

1083
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,980
I bet there's a lot of people still really addicted.

1084
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,540
Remember, you won a hard drive.

1085
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,140
I did, that's right.

1086
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,220
My computer actually came from that Final Fantasy event in my first E3, but anyway,

1087
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,220
that's another story.

1088
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,620
I was going to ask, I was going to say, video game cosplay is very popular, have you seen

1089
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,020
any cool cosplay while you've been there?

1090
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:15,380
Yeah, there's tons, there's a while attic, I found about three really really good costumes,

1091
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:21,820
and I'll post some pictures up when I get home, but they're like really well done,

1092
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,980
they look exactly like they look in game, which I found really impressive.

1093
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,380
Now Rama would like to point out for those of us here, that Anime Expo is not an anime

1094
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:36,060
con, it's a trade show, and apparently there's a very distinct difference, I guess because

1095
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:43,060
I don't follow the con scene enough, it kind of feels the same to me, but, I see.

1096
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,020
Well what about, you said there was some gaming stuff there, what about tournaments, is there

1097
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,940
any big tournaments, or I know these cons usually have a game room, what kinds of stuff

1098
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,940
have been around in the game?

1099
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:56,260
Yeah, there's a pretty big console room with Guitar Hero and the typical fighting type

1100
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,260
games.

1101
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,020
There was a Pokemon tournament last night, and there's been various fighting game tournaments

1102
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:09,100
for Guilty Gear and Naruto, there's a Smash Bros tournament tomorrow that I will be playing

1103
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,940
in and losing in the first round, and so, there's definitely a lot of stuff for gamers

1104
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,980
to do at the show.

1105
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,980
Very cool.

1106
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,160
A Super Smash Bros tournament, man, that game's been out for how long, and it's still so,

1107
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,160
so popular.

1108
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:27,260
Yet I didn't hear you say DDR or Beat Mania or any of those games that we used to go to

1109
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,260
all the time.

1110
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:33,620
No, the DDR music games kind of, I don't know, they've kind of died off in popularity over

1111
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,620
here on the West Coast.

1112
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,620
Ouch.

1113
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:42,260
Otherwise, there is an arcade, though, and they are pretty busy with Supernova and Extreme,

1114
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,860
and I think Drum Mania V.

1115
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,380
So how long is the con running?

1116
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,380
How long is the con?

1117
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,380
Tomorrow.

1118
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,380
It ends tomorrow?

1119
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,380
Yeah.

1120
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,140
All right, well, make sure you go get your hands on Guilty Gear for us, and you can give

1121
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,140
some impressions of it.

1122
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,140
Definitely, definitely will.

1123
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,140
All right.

1124
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,620
Rama would like to clarify, Anime Expo is a trade show because their board of directors

1125
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:08,340
are people from the anime industry, and they use Anime Expo to promote new titles more

1126
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,660
than any other con.

1127
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:15,340
Think of Anime Expo as the anime equivalent of E3, and Insanus adds to that, also, Anime

1128
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,340
Expo sucks.

1129
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,260
Well, that's an opinion, but you sound like you're having a lot of fun at the con, right?

1130
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,260
Right, Jimmy?

1131
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,820
All right, he just wants the QQ, give me a hand and come and do it.

1132
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,880
All right, well, Jimmy, anything else you want to add about the convention?

1133
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,860
If you can come next year, we can come hang out, I'll buy drinks.

1134
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,420
Oh, hey, if there's drinks there, I'm there.

1135
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,700
But I will be in SoCal for E for All, so we'll see you then.

1136
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,140
All right, have a nice night, guys.

1137
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,140
All right, later, buddy.

1138
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,140
Thanks for the call.

1139
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,140
Bye.

1140
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,140
Bye.

1141
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,700
Our roving reporter, Jimmy, also known as DJ Tyrant.

1142
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,460
All right, let's go to the phones.

1143
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,060
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

1144
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,060
Who's this?

1145
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,060
It's GS68.

1146
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,060
Hello, GS68.

1147
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,060
What's on your mind, my friend?

1148
00:52:55,060 --> 00:53:00,100
First of all, it wasn't me calling before I met because my mic wasn't set up right.

1149
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,100
It's all right.

1150
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,100
We'll forgive you.

1151
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,740
All right, you're the one, could you hear us yelling at you in Spanish and everything?

1152
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,740
Yeah.

1153
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,740
All right.

1154
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,740
That's got to be embarrassing.

1155
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,740
All right, well, now you're on.

1156
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,740
What's on your mind?

1157
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,700
First of all, I was eating cup noodles when rice persons were staying angry, so I had

1158
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:20,300
to spit that out.

1159
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,780
That is probably going to be one of those OLR taglines that's beaten into the ground,

1160
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,780
but that's all right.

1161
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,780
It is kind of funny.

1162
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,780
I just hope nobody takes it the wrong way.

1163
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,700
Like, I don't want, like, somebody who's, like, uninformed on this program to be all,

1164
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,180
like, they use the word bag too much in their program.

1165
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:35,100
Anyway, what else do you want to talk about tonight, GS68?

1166
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:41,900
Yeah, I've been, like, on a Guitar Hero message board, I've been talking about the hyper speed

1167
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,300
code lately and how some people think it's a cheat.

1168
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,540
Like, what are your thoughts on it?

1169
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,380
I do not know of the hyper speed code.

1170
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,500
Give me a little background on this.

1171
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,580
What's this about?

1172
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:56,940
On the Guitar Hero 2 title screen, you press orange, blue, orange, yellow, orange, blue,

1173
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,700
orange, yellow, and then it says cheat activated hyper speed.

1174
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,580
And what exactly does that do to the game?

1175
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,060
Does it make the songs run faster or something?

1176
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,180
No, it makes the notes scroll faster.

1177
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:12,060
It's kind of like times two speed in DDR or high speed in Beatmania.

1178
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:15,940
Oh, okay, well, I don't know if that's cheating or not.

1179
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,220
I mean, I guess maybe the developers intended it to be a cheat if that's what they're labeling

1180
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,700
it as in the game, but I don't know, like, in Beatmania, I never considered that a cheat.

1181
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,780
I mean, God, that's what you have to use to play some of those songs.

1182
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,980
I don't know any other way.

1183
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,660
But I don't know, maybe it is cheating, even in Beatmania, and for whatever reason the

1184
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,220
community doesn't really look at it that way.

1185
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,180
But I think they just never looked at it that way because it's always been considered a

1186
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,180
modifier.

1187
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,180
Yeah.

1188
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:46,500
Because, like, people whose music gaming experience is one of the Guitar Hero, like, have never

1189
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,260
heard of it being a mod, so when they saw that it was a cheat, they automatically thought

1190
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,240
it was a cheat because it says cheat activated.

1191
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,940
What are your thoughts on it?

1192
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,900
Well, I think it's legit.

1193
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:02,780
I mean, if you think it helps you, just use it.

1194
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:09,380
I mean, it's been out of the money gates for years without question, so why call it cheating

1195
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,380
now?

1196
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,220
I mean, it's still the same notes, right?

1197
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,220
Yeah.

1198
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,020
And it's not going to help you beat Jordan on Expert, right?

1199
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,140
Probably, probably not.

1200
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:22,260
So what's the big freaking deal?

1201
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,340
I mean, if you close your eyes and play the song, I mean, does Hyperspeed really make

1202
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,340
a difference?

1203
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,660
Well, if you close your eyes and play the song, is that how you have to beat Jordan

1204
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,660
Expert?

1205
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,660
Probably, huh?

1206
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,820
Well, if you for some reason memorized the song, I mean...

1207
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:43,220
I think if you've actually gone to the great extents to memorize Guitar Hero 2 songs, instead

1208
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:49,020
of using the speed modifier, I would recommend you go outside.

1209
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,020
I'm just messing.

1210
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,020
Hypothetically speaking.

1211
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,020
I know, I know.

1212
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,780
Hey, people memorize the DDR songs, so why not the Guitar Hero songs?

1213
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,780
It happens.

1214
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,780
Yeah.

1215
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,780
All right, well, any other thoughts, GS68?

1216
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,020
No, that's pretty much it.

1217
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,260
All right, well, thank you so much for the call, and have a great night, and thanks for

1218
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,260
calling.

1219
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,260
All right, thank you too.

1220
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,260
All right, later.

1221
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,260
Later.

1222
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,140
All right, let's go to some more calls here on the Skype line, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1223
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,140
Let's go to this call.

1224
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,140
Oops.

1225
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,380
If I can, go to the next call.

1226
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:22,100
The call I was just about to pick up dropped, live radio, boys and girls.

1227
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,100
Good one, Rock.

1228
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,100
Geez.

1229
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,100
It happens all the fucking time.

1230
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,100
Let's go to this call.

1231
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1232
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,100
Who's this?

1233
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,100
It'll be Dark Knight.

1234
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,100
Hello, Dark Knight.

1235
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,100
What's on your mind?

1236
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,100
Nothing much.

1237
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,300
Thought y'all would talk about Soul Calibur for a little bit.

1238
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,300
I wanted to touch up on something I discussed last week.

1239
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,300
Sure.

1240
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,020
Soul Calibur IV online, good stuff.

1241
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,020
What's up?

1242
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:45,700
It's supposed to be like a side story game, Soul Calibur Legends.

1243
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,700
Yes.

1244
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,700
This is the game that's being created for the Nintendo Wii, if I remember right, right?

1245
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,700
It's not side-scrolling, though.

1246
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,700
It's just kind of a hack-and-slash.

1247
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,700
Yeah.

1248
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:59,340
Wasn't that how Mortal Kombat, what was that, Shallon Monks or whatever was kind of like

1249
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,340
that?

1250
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,340
Yeah.

1251
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,340
Oh, okay.

1252
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,340
That might be kind of cool.

1253
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,340
I was thinking more of Tekken Force.

1254
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:08,060
Oh, like one of the adventure modes that you get in the Tekken games?

1255
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:12,020
I would say it looks more like the Mortal Kombat Shallon Monks games, because I know

1256
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,740
Tekken Force is more like Final Fight or something like that.

1257
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,020
Here's the only thing I care about, is Ivy in it, yes or no?

1258
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,020
Yes.

1259
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,020
Sold.

1260
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:24,900
I think it's mostly reviving around Siegfried, I think, if I'm not mistaken.

1261
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,900
All right.

1262
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,900
Well, what else have you heard on the game?

1263
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:34,340
Just early development details and whatnot, they had a picture on it on Kotaku.com, and

1264
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:39,300
it just looked like a test shot, because all I saw was basically Siegfried swinging a sword

1265
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,300
around a bunch of mummies.

1266
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:48,660
I mean, I like the concept and all, so.

1267
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:52,020
Is it the type of game you think you're going to buy?

1268
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,500
I don't own a Wii, so.

1269
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Oh, you don't own a Wii?

1270
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
I can't really answer that question.

1271
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,620
Is that because you don't want one or because you can't find one?

1272
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,620
Both.

1273
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,780
I actually decided that I was going to go get a 360.

1274
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,780
Ah, okay.

1275
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,780
All right.

1276
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,220
But that won't be until November's top with the office itself.

1277
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,220
Well, you never know.

1278
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,460
If you ever luck out, maybe the game will come out cross-platform.

1279
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,900
Yeah, give it time and whatnot.

1280
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:21,340
Another game I had on mind, but I think I just totally lost track.

1281
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,340
Guitar Hero 80s.

1282
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:26,980
I actually saw Dom's song, Glitz, and everything, and there are actually some decent songs that

1283
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:27,980
I loved.

1284
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:28,980
I don't know why some of y'all didn't like it.

1285
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:29,980
Some of y'all wasn't liking some of the songs.

1286
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:30,980
Yeah, what's your problem, Rice Princess?

1287
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,980
Why didn't you like Guitar Hero's 80s editions?

1288
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,980
What's your big issue?

1289
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,380
Well, if I knew what any of the songs were, I might like it better.

1290
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,300
I mean, listen to Butt Rock in the 80s.

1291
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,420
That's just because you're a child.

1292
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,420
How old are you, Rice Princess?

1293
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,420
I'm a child.

1294
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,580
I am not a child.

1295
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,060
People in the chatroom are children.

1296
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,060
How old are you?

1297
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,060
72.

1298
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,580
You're not 72, and you weren't born in 72.

1299
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,580
73.

1300
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,580
Come on, how old are you?

1301
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,580
I'm 25.

1302
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,580
25.

1303
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,580
See, she's just a baby.

1304
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,580
I am not a baby.

1305
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,460
How could you call me a baby?

1306
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,780
25 is not a baby.

1307
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,780
How could you call me a baby?

1308
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:08,660
If you're older than most of the people in the chatroom, you're not a baby.

1309
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,540
You're a baby.

1310
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,300
Do you remember Friendship Bracelets and Garbage Pail Kids?

1311
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,300
Yeah.

1312
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,300
Do you remember Slap Bracelets?

1313
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,300
Yes, I do.

1314
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,300
Yeah.

1315
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,300
Those were pretty awesome.

1316
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,300
And Hypercolor Shirts.

1317
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,300
Yeah, I do.

1318
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,300
Yeah, anyway.

1319
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,300
All right.

1320
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,300
Anyhow.

1321
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,300
Well, then I don't know what her problem is.

1322
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,580
She was just listening to the wrong kind of music in the 80s.

1323
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,580
The wrong kind of music?

1324
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,580
No, I don't.

1325
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,500
I have to admit, I'm not that excited about the track list either, Dark Knight.

1326
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:35,380
There's some songs that made me go, woohoo, but a lot of it kind of makes me go, hmm.

1327
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,660
Not really a memorable song.

1328
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,620
But what to you makes a song list great?

1329
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,980
Convince us we're wrong.

1330
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:42,980
Give me Stairway.

1331
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,300
I mean, Turn the Japanese might be one.

1332
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,780
But if I had the power to add a song, give me Stairway to Heaven.

1333
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,860
I know exactly.

1334
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,860
No stairway denied.

1335
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,860
I know.

1336
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,860
Wow.

1337
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,860
All right.

1338
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:56,860
Dark Knight, we've got to let you go.

1339
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,860
Any last thoughts real quick?

1340
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:04,500
Um, also, um, you need to start playing PSU again because, um, well, that's why you have

1341
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,500
360.

1342
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,500
You probably already got it.

1343
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,700
But they recently gave out Sonic statues.

1344
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,700
Really?

1345
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,700
Everybody.

1346
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,500
No, God, I haven't touched the game in forever, but I think my membership is still active

1347
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,500
and I'm paying for it.

1348
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,060
I just haven't gone into the game in forever.

1349
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,060
So we'll see.

1350
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,180
Yeah, everybody got a Sonic statue now.

1351
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,180
It's you know what?

1352
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,020
I pull me away from World of Warcraft, seriously.

1353
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,540
And I feel like I know I'm going to get so much hate mail, like Rob, play a real game.

1354
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:32,260
But I can't explain how addicting this game is and it's the social end of it completely

1355
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,180
because of the fact that a lot of my friends play it.

1356
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,620
It's not even really the game itself that I'm in love with.

1357
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,620
I'm in love with Ventrilo.

1358
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,620
That's my problem.

1359
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:46,740
I'm not going to go into detail about the Ventrilo thing, but I mean, it is right now

1360
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:52,100
the game is just, I think it's kind of winding down now because the expansion is coming.

1361
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,340
Well I, it'll be, hopefully, hopefully the expansion will give it a good badly needed

1362
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:58,460
kick in the pants because I would like to get back into some PSU.

1363
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:06,900
Anyway, quick plug for my show because I do a show on This is Genius Radio, Dark Knight

1364
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,700

1365
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,700
about this week, the iPhone.

1366
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,860
Ooh, iPhone.

1367
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,860
I saw one this week.

1368
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,860
They're very pretty.

1369
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,260
Well I will try to tune in and I think I'm supposed to be on the show this week or very

1370
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,260
soon.

1371
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,260
Yes?

1372
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,260
Yes.

1373
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,260
Yes.

1374
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,460
I just have to double check my personal calendar, but I should be there.

1375
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,460
Okay.

1376
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,460
All right.

1377
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,460
That's it.

1378
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,460
All right.

1379
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,460
Take care, buddy.

1380
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,460
Thanks for calling.

1381
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,460
Bye, folks.

1382
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,460
All right.

1383
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:40,580
Dark Knight here on Orange Launch Radio and everybody's got their own show these days.

1384
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:41,580
I swear to God.

1385
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,580
I swear to God.

1386
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:43,580
No, it's all good though.

1387
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,580
I like Dark Knight.

1388
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,580
Hi, you're on.

1389
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,220
I'm going to punch that guy in the face.

1390
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,220
You know who you are.

1391
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,220
Punch him in the ass.

1392
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,220
You told me you fixed it.

1393
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:57,500
Now that's another edit.

1394
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,140
Ah, forget it.

1395
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,140
I'm not going to edit that out.

1396
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,020
Podcast listeners, you guys can deal with it.

1397
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,020
Way to be lazy.

1398
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,020
That was DMN, by the way.

1399
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:08,100
If you want to hate somebody for blowing your ears out, that was Insanist, DMN, whatever

1400
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,500
the hell your name is right now.

1401
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,500
Love you.

1402
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,500
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1403
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,500
Who's this?

1404
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,500
Mushy Mushy.

1405
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,500
Mushy Mushy?

1406
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,500
No, it's relevant.

1407
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
Oh, like you're saying hello.

1408
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:26,140
I hear myself.

1409
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,140
It's okay.

1410
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,140
Sometimes there is a bit of an echo.

1411
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,140
Identify yourself, please.

1412
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,140
Nintendo Maniac 64.

1413
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,140
Nintendo Maniac 64.

1414
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,140
What's on your mind, my friend?

1415
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,140
Well, dealing with the Japanese thing.

1416
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,140
What was it?

1417
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,140
You got a letter.

1418
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,140
Is this your first Japanese listener on the show?

1419
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,140
Is that a letter in the book?

1420
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,140
No, I think Peekers.

1421
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,140
Peekers.

1422
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:40,140
Peekers.

1423
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,140
Peekers.

1424
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,140
Peekers.

1425
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,140
Peekers.

1426
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,140
Peekers.

1427
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,140
Peekers.

1428
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,140
Peekers.

1429
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,140
Peekers.

1430
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:51,100
And also I think Peeker Uno is also in Japan from my following him on Twitter.

1431
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,420
Because I actually have a Twitter account.

1432
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,000
And some of the listeners have me added on there as Sky on Twitter.

1433
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,820
And I picked up the He's in Japan.

1434
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,740
Who is the really Japanese, though?

1435
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:06,100
I haven't the foggiest idea, but I'm sure I'm going to get a Twitter about it now.

1436
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,420
The message is Japanese.

1437
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,320
Actually, I've looked at the statistics.

1438
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,700
We do have some Japanese listeners.

1439
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,220
We have listeners all over the world, just not all of them are vocal.

1440
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,220
But I understand.

1441
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:20,700
lot of effort to write an email so I you know no expectations but I don't think

1442
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,940
this guy's the first one but he's the first email I can recall getting from

1443
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:31,100
Japan but we have had emails from other parts of Asia okay so other than that

1444
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:37,580
uh oh yeah you know I returned out earlier with the it was like a bad were

1445
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,580

01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:59,580
to find it forever I got it and that smashing glass level it's like but I got

1463
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:04,020
golden in like I think like an hour or something like what you think like how

1464
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:07,980
it gets really hard like it gets harder as you pass through some of the levels

1465
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,900
in there what exactly do you do in this level well there's like they have

1466
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,180
different levels like breaking stuff usually it'll be with a brick or

1467
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:18,700
something and you have to smash windows and you have to throw a brick through it

1468
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:28,380
and it's it's pretty hard you have to go through and other way all right well

1469
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,860
we're gonna go ahead and let you go buddy but thanks so much for giving us

1473
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:49,780
been on the air quite a while now we got to wrap things up so let's go around now

1474
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,100
since there's no last-minute stories we're gonna go around and get everybody

1475
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,980
no no that's not the case oh you found something of course I was taking the

1476
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:02,420
time to pull up the stories go for it and the rumor is apparently beautiful

1477
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:05,180
katamari is gonna be skipping the PlayStation 3 and going straight to the

1478
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:12,420
Wii and it's supposed to be coming out next year on the Wii I'll be honest

1479
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:17,100
though I would say it's coming out in both fiscal year 2008 that's just my

1480
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:23,860
guess though didn't you get in trouble for that once before no I'm guessing I

1481
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,700
don't know okay but I would if I were to guess I would say it's coming fiscal

1482
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:33,420
year I honestly don't give a fuck anymore I sure I don't give a fuck let

1483
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,020
the game come out wherever it's gonna come out and maybe I'll buy it if it's

1484
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:42,260
not just a copy of the first game exactly um anyways so some other stuff

1485
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:48,140
that's gonna be interesting this was kind of a surprise to me although this

1486
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:53,060
is one of the only films of his I'm gonna go see postal is being being

1487
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:57,580
called what the hell my microphone went out there for a second no I turned the

1488
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,980
audio and sorry you're fine anyways postal is being called one of the best

1489
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:08,180
films and apparently it got standing ovations at cans which is very

1490
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:14,740
surprising but um I don't know everybody at the can film festival is on ecstasy

1491
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:21,300
apparently it says anyways it says we've all calls it his final statement he says

1492
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:25,700
you can make you can't make a more radical movie there is no way you can

1493
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:30,140
ignore postal it's one of the funniest and most important films of lack of the

1494
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:34,580
last decade it is one of the best films of all times of course this is a wee

1495
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:37,220
bull talking about himself were they giving it a standing ovation because they

1496
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:41,980
got to leave maybe I don't know I think it looks cheesy I know it's gonna be

1497
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:48,060
offensive that's you know that's it a dark tetsuya says or was a way bold just

1498
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:53,780
dreaming the whole thing yeah he might have been some other interesting stuff

1499
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:57,980
on game that's been announced to be coming to the Wii is called the blob

1500
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:03,020
which apparently is going to be kind of similar it was a there was actually a

1501
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:06,700
contest it was involved a student project it's kind of a cross between

1502
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:10,700
katamari and I guess I don't know you paint buildings with this giant blob of

1503
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:15,000
paint and roll it around and stuff so it looks kind of neat will the game also

1504
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:24,060
feature a boy no so it can be a boy in his blob get it yeah I got oh my god and

1505
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:28,580
then real quick some of the virtual console games coming out here in the

1506
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:32,280
next few weeks at least it's her graphic 16 stuff this ought to make Christopher

1507
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:37,480
happy but let's see it's got to be devil's devil's crush I knew it

1508
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:43,220
Arizona and drop-off and silent debuggers where the fuck is splatter
