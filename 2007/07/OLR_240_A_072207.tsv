14059	19446	Tonight, July 22nd, 2007, could the next Final Fantasy use the Wii Fit Board?
19866	22610	Microsoft faces another lawsuit over scratched discs.
23131	25855	And could World of Warcraft win South Park and Emmy?
32677	34158	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
34238	36699	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36759	43423	We are that internet radio program dedicated to video games, video gaming, and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
43864	44524	That's a whole lot.
44724	48186	We've tried to fit a lot into this program, but that's why we're always split up into two parts.
48586	55910	When you listen to us on our downloadable podcast, or if you listen live on Sunday nights, you get like three and a half hours of radio, just us here.
56331	57231	My name is Rob Roberts.
57271	58172	You might know me as Sky.
58212	60453	Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
60613	61073	Hi.
61414	61794	And how are you?
62489	62969	Hi.
63329	63690	Hi.
63870	64890	Are you high on drugs?
65230	65650	I am.
66051	66711	But legal ones?
67711	68852	Yeah, they're prescription.
69072	72233	We wouldn't endorse doing the other kind of drugs, because that's bad, okay?
72273	72914	Not publicly.
73154	73374	Yes.
73574	73874	All right.
74654	76315	Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
76455	76695	Hello.
77075	77736	How are you doing, Loki?
77956	78196	Fine.
79376	79857	Had a good week?
81978	82378	Yes.
83348	84109	and DarkSakura.com.
101139	105821	So, for those that have never heard... Well, you haven't actually sat in on a full show in a long, long time.
105901	106922	Oh, yeah, that's true.
107222	108562	And you're actually really loud tonight.
108662	109283	I am.
109323	110583	That's kind of something else.
110603	111163	I'm booming.
111363	111764	That's all right.
112944	116325	Miklatov usually has a very quiet voice, so we have to turn up the volume all the way.
116526	117686	Yes.
117886	123709	Now, for those that haven't heard the show before, Miklatov works for Konami and does DDR stuff.
123909	124129	Yes.
124329	125329	And that's all we can really say.
125809	127770	But they're closing soon, right?
127830	128050	Yes.
128471	129291	So, are you...
129867	130688	I don't care if they listen.
143550	143830	All right.
144330	145951	Well, Migatov's here because he likes games.
145991	146971	He's not just here to dish on.
147011	149692	I'm actually here because I was up here for Harry Potter.
151052	153413	I suppose it's inevitable because somebody was noticing.
153453	154353	Hi, chat room, by the way.
154393	157154	Our chat room is available to chat.orangelauntrader.com.
157934	159935	Lots of first-time listeners tonight.
159995	162035	I was noticing some folks saying it was their first time listening.
162075	163876	So hello to all of you first-time listeners and chat.
164988	170570	It's kind of a smaller audience in chat tonight, though, and I was thinking maybe part of that is that people are reading Harry Potter right now.
170810	171450	They are.
171570	174391	They should actually be done with it, because it's been out for like two days.
174911	178412	I finished an hour before I left the house.
179312	180912	Oh my gosh, so you finished the book.
180972	182293	It was about two hours ago.
182513	183513	So both of you finished the book.
183553	185433	Yeah, I finished about this afternoon sometime.
185614	186454	And I don't read the books.
186614	190535	I would have been done last night, but I had to play D&D.
192924	197826	I just wanted to get done with it because then I could go back on the internet and not get spoiled by things.
198246	200327	I know, I hate all of you spoiler people.
201387	202568	No spoilers in chat tonight.
202588	203468	Don't even try to be funny.
203508	204108	It's not cool.
204288	206209	So please don't ruin the book for those who haven't finished yet.
206229	207369	This is a lot to ruin.
207489	210090	I will Avada Kedavra your ass.
210931	214052	I went directly to the spoiler page as soon as I found it.
214092	215292	I don't know, it's part of me.
215312	217573	I like to be spoiled and find out what's going to happen.
217593	218674	I don't even really read the books.
218714	219334	I watch the movies.
219980	220760	I haven't seen the newest one.
220860	222081	In fact, I didn't see the fourth one either.
222181	223241	But I like the first three movies.
223882	224302	They're cool.
224322	227103	The fifth movie sucks.
227683	230184	Now, Jamie, did you actually go to the bookstore at midnight to buy the book?
230524	232565	No, I was smart and went on Amazon.
233206	234326	Oh, so you had it delivered to your house.
234966	235246	Yes.
236027	237227	I went to Barnes & Noble.
237547	241449	Because I was also high on Vicodin on Friday night, too.
241469	242029	That works.
242109	243750	And I couldn't drive to the bookstore.
243790	246231	Although Dan said that he went to Walmart and almost bought me one.
247214	250138	TheRobD says, spoiler, Jesus dies on page 681.
250859	252922	Oh, you weren't looking for Bible spoilers.
254083	254384	Get it?
255025	256266	I think I saw that same joke on Dig this week.
259918	261179	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
282388	283189	And I loved it.
283269	284129	It was like a video game.
284169	285951	It had Sky Pirates, like Final Fantasy XII.
285971	286651	It was awesome.
286771	287452	And like magic.
287532	288532	And Michelle Pfeiffer was a witch.
288812	289213	It was great.
289593	291914	So I wanted to get the book that it was based on.
292155	293215	And they had it at Barnes & Noble.
293535	296798	But then I had to go through crowds and crowds of people.
296858	297858	It was crazy.
298519	300040	Why did you go on Harry Potter night?
300180	303142	Because I was at... I went to two Barnes & Nobles for Harry Potter night.
303242	307224	We went to eat at Dos Coyotes, which was like right next door to Barnes & Noble.
307265	308806	So we just decided to go there.
308826	310847	I was like, I want to get the Stardust book right now.
311334	316217	I was there too, waiting with my wife for the book, and I was playing Final Fantasy.
318298	319799	Well, that makes you a nerd too.
320299	325903	I waited in the Harry Potter line last year, and I had already bought my British one online.
326984	331726	And I ended up, it still wasn't as bad as the Dreamcast line in 99.
331906	334228	It was the Dreamcast line I sat and read books.
335302	339266	Uninvited says, we handed out cupcakes for our book release at Walmart and this old smelly lady came up and ate like 12.
354784	357965	You should have said one per person, unless you ordered 12 books.
358125	359685	Or had a little sign or something.
360206	365107	That just kind of reminded me of the time the Wii came out and we were handing out the soda and the donuts.
365327	366247	The smelly people.
367588	371409	Some were smelly, but not at the Target we ended up staying at.
371429	373049	They were all well bathed.
373370	375010	It was too cold to be smelly.
376170	380011	Because when it's cold, you can't really smell people as badly as when it's hot.
380312	381572	Like at anime conventions.
382600	384781	I think that Fanboy Funk is worse in the summer.
386562	387763	If you let it sit out for a little while.
388443	391125	Fanboy Funk does not take summer vacation.
392146	393646	Alright, let's talk about video games.
393666	394967	We're like more than five minutes into the show.
394987	396268	We haven't even talked about video games.
396348	398389	I said Final Fantasy.
398429	399550	There are four video games.
399690	401811	Harry Potters are video games too.
401851	403052	But they're not good.
403072	403872	No, they're not.
403932	406474	It's because they're made by EA.
406534	407975	Why isn't there a good Harry Potter game?
407995	408615	Because they're made by EA.
408635	410276	Because they haven't made me design one.
410376	413260	That does not mean that it should be a bad game if it's made by EA.
413420	416885	No, it's the fact that they take franchises and don't care about them.
416925	418047	They're just like, ooh, give me money.
418107	418668	And poop on them.
418728	419749	Yeah.
420009	421111	Here was the nerdiest thing ever, though.
421131	425878	We were at Clean Jumper last night or whatever, and we were going around the table going, like, what?
426418	428861	What house would you be in if you were in Harry Potter?
429162	430483	Probably be in Sparkly Poo.
431004	432506	There is no Sparkly Poo.
432606	433947	You have to read the fan fiction.
434648	438893	Anyway, so we thought, why isn't Harry Potter like an MMO?
438953	441056	Why isn't there an MMO set in the Harry Potter universe?
441276	442718	Millions of people would play it.
443439	449643	If you could have actual Quidditch and doing quests in the Harry Potter universe, why isn't there actually an MMO?
449663	451564	That Quidditch game on PS2 is fun, too.
451804	451965	Exactly.
452005	452925	Or GameCube or whatever it was.
453065	454826	Because I don't think the universe would be that big.
454906	458929	I mean, it'd be Hogwarts and... There's really only a few hundred students.
458949	461871	Well, I guess you could have a bunch of other schools.
461911	463432	Yeah, there are other schools, so it could work.
463452	464973	Well, now there's not going to be any more books.
465113	467975	Why not have an MMO in the Harry Potter universe?
469536	469776	Hmm?
469936	470977	Who says it's not coming?
471037	472438	I mean, look at Lord of the Rings Online.
472458	472978	I didn't know.
473436	477417	I did the quiz that was on the Warner Brothers site and I got Slytherin.
479818	481518	I think I did the quiz and I got Ravenclaw.
481538	482699	I was like, what the fuck's a Ravenclaw?
483419	485559	Ravenclaws are the smart people, Rob.
485579	488860	Slytherin are even smarter because they're also sneaky.
490021	491841	Alright, let's get to actual video game chat.
491861	493182	We'll start with, how was your gaming week?
493222	494322	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
494342	494582	Games?
494702	495362	What games?
496403	497923	I've been high on Vicodin all week.
499099	500299	So I haven't played anything.
500500	501200	Not even pinball?
501920	503301	No, I played World Cup Soccer.
503941	504701	See, there's something.
505101	508402	But I am owie, so I can't really do much gaming.
508823	509683	Alright, well that's alright.
510303	511223	Loki, how was your gaming week?
511844	514244	I played Paper Mario on the Virtual Console.
515185	517506	Not exactly like Super Paper Mario.
517706	522608	A little bit disappointing, but I don't know, it's tolerable for right now, I guess.
523748	523828	Um...
524721	529842	I think if I played that right after I played Super Mario RPG I would have been greatly disappointed.
532203	533343	Then I played Final Fantasy.
533663	535723	I'm actually most of the way through the game now.
538584	540204	What else did I do gaming related?
540904	547606	I fully disassembled the PSP and put it back together again because I was thinking let me put it this way.
547906	553967	I have charge cables for my PSP but they're at work and I wanted to play Final Fantasy and my battery was low
554409	561754	So I was going to make my own charge cable, but then I couldn't find my car adapter cable that was going to hack apart for the second half of it.
562594	571420	So I was like, well, I can just solder some stuff onto the USB port onto the PSP and just solder that to the power port, and then it should be able to charge via USB.
572300	574261	So I took that all apart and got fascinated with that.
574281	576723	I'm like, crap, this is not going to go back together again, is it?
577323	583207	So I put it back together, and I think it's working now, except for some reason, though, when I put the USB charge cable I bought today on it,
583533	593283	It wasn't lighting up, so I don't know if that's just the battery that's in there that's so dead that it won't charge with that or what, but hopefully it works.
593603	598188	Otherwise, that's my, you know, parts PSP anyway, so I gotta sell it so I can get a new one.
599570	603794	Um, then other than that, I tried playing, oh, I played Super Rub-a-Dub on, uh, PS3.
603814	603894	Crap.
607048	608569	Is that one of those new downloadable games?
608589	609590	The one with the ducks or whatever?
609630	610631	Yes, it's the one with the ducks.
610731	611471	It's actually a game?
611532	613393	Yeah, it's stupid.
613433	614534	What do you do in the game?
614654	620779	You tilt using the six axis because that's almost every single game that's downloadable on the PSP right now, or PS3.
621699	625142	You tilt the six axis to make the ducks go around.
625182	626803	You collect ducks and get to the drain.
627384	628685	It is crap.
628865	630506	It is so fucking hard to control.
631027	631547	It's not fun.
632293	634414	GK128 in our chatroom agrees with you.
634434	636394	Super rub-a-dub for the lose.
660216	685275	GK128 says the control in Super Rub-a-Dub is so bad it doesn't even follow your movements right it doesn't and it's just way too sensitive so no thanks I ended up selling a lot or I sold back Motorstorm today now I'm just stuck with Resistance which is a great game but my Playstation 3 right now is being treated like my PSP except my PSP has more gaming going along with it because I don't have to buy games anymore for it
687549	690794	If only they had that for the... Oh, I'm thinking about modding my Wii.
691235	694339	That might be something that's coming on mod chips so I can play some import games.
695541	696082	Good times.
696503	696723	All right.
697301	700003	Miglatov, you want to share with us your gaming week, if anything?
700203	705987	I've still been trying to think if I played anything this week besides WoW, and I don't think I did.
706187	707128	So I played WoW.
707308	708249	What happened in WoW?
708469	721158	WoW made me sad because I decided to level up my tailoring, and there's this one piece of cloth I can only make every three days in 22 hours, so I'm waiting for that time limit to be up.
721739	723960	I'm just being disgruntled the whole time while I wait.
725501	726302	And that's it.
727369	728270	All right, aren't you exciting?
728650	729070	I am.
729911	730191	What's up?
730351	731212	It's something in the air.
731252	732613	Not a lot of game playing this week.
732833	734294	Well, I do that at work.
734975	735975	So why would I do it?
735995	736576	I guess that's true.
736596	737036	I could see that.
738979	739759	I got a game.
740299	740760	What'd you get?
740780	752844	I got Marvel Ultimate Alliance for Xbox 360, but I didn't get the gold one, because Dan was being a cheap butt, and he said that I could just download Hawkeye, because it's really the only character I care about.
753464	757385	Oh, okay, so instead of downloading the Uber thing that had everybody, you can just get the one character you want.
757846	758506	Yeah.
758526	759386	That works.
759606	760626	I haven't played it yet.
760847	765748	I also play Call of Duty 3 multiplayer for a little bit, and there was one cool kill that I had.
765768	767649	We were playing on Eater Dam, and I was driving the...
768502	769302	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
783996	786097	and then, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
786237	788077	Still playing that, still yelling at everybody.
788418	788658	Nerd.
789618	798141	My gaming week, I tried some of the new downloads that are available on Xbox Live Marketplace like Bomberman Live, but I only really played the demo for Bomberman.
798181	801202	I didn't download the full game, so I don't really want to give a full review, but...
802222	805985	It definitely already right off the bat was way better than Act Zero, that's for sure.
806145	807025	Even just the demo.
807425	811168	The free demo is better than the $60 Act Zero, so I was pleased with that.
811288	812288	It's like $20 now.
812488	813589	Still $20 too much.
813609	815210	That's still $20 too much for that game.
815970	816831	But it's cool, you know.
817451	818972	It's classic Bomberman.
819012	826096	So if you remember Bomberman from the Super Nintendo days, I did notice, though, that when you do buy the regular version of it, you're going to be able to customize the game to hell.
826436	830359	Like, you know, you can just customize any type of environment you want to play in, and...
831039	832480	It's not one of those ones that's like...
857363	858864	I've stood up against the test of time.
882691	906407	JV Mon says it sucks ass back in the day back in the day I preferred it to Kung Fu Master yeah I way preferred it to Kung Fu Master but just now I just I can't you know like sometimes I try to I find my retro game love for the simple games but like Yara Kung Fu is not one of those games I can just find my love for again because I guess I never really had that much there's some of these games on live that they seem to forget about like you know
907120	907881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
923038	946125	and I noticed that I'd fallen not just to second place within my own friends list but third place within my own friends list and like at one point I had a score in the top 100 okay so I was like alright I gotta play this some more and try to improve my score so I did and I'm back up to second place now within my friends and now I gotta try and get back up to first place so I'm working on it playing some more songs but yeah there's no downloadable stuff for Boom and Rocket at all
946738	950240	It's kind of sad, because I'm not a big fan of the tracks that come with the game.
950500	966206	I even went to GameStop today, and I was like, I've got to get me another game, because I had, like, Forza 2, Shadowrun, and, like, Tenchu Z, and Monster Madness Belfast Suburbia, all brand new copies that I got from work, but I was like, I don't want to play any of this.
966587	969548	Even Forza 2, I was like, well, I could maybe design some cars or something.
969588	974370	I'm like, no, that's, no, I'm not going to get suckered into playing this just like I did Project Gotham Racing 3.
975704	977825	Project Gotham Racing 4, that looks pretty good too.
978005	981206	But I'm going to get suckered into buying that and hate it and then return it back.
981226	982426	Either way.
982446	984487	You need to get one of those game rental accounts.
984727	985167	It doesn't matter.
985327	988528	I'm going to get it probably, you know, Microsoft games I usually get for free.
988548	989288	All right, all right.
989988	993530	Jvmon in chat agrees with me, by the way, that the tracks that come with the game are pretty boring.
993550	994210	So there you go.
995090	996611	That one I like is really good.
996631	998271	I don't know, Smooth Operetta?
998411	999351	Yeah, Smooth Operetta.
999411	1000332	Yeah, that's a great song.
1000352	1003873	I'm surprised Konami hasn't done like, well, I guess they wouldn't want to do that because of...
1004827	1006027	What, a downloadable DDR or something?
1019113	1019933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1042721	1043981	But I'm like in last place.
1044321	1052403	I've gone from Boom Boom Rocket, a game where I'm second place amongst all my friends, to Carcassonne where I'm in last place amongst all my friends because I'm just not that good at it.
1052703	1054384	I'm still trying to figure out the strategy to it.
1054664	1055464	But I'm having fun.
1055624	1063946	I like the fact that it's like a board game, but it kind of has its own – basically the way Carcassonne is is that you're building –
1064705	1065946	A puzzle every time.
1065986	1071688	And that puzzle involves cities and roads and monasteries and all this stuff.
1071708	1075770	And you draw out these cards in a random order and play them down.
1076191	1078232	And so, you know, roads have to connect to other roads.
1078572	1079972	Cities have to connect to other cities.
1080333	1084715	And when you claim roads or claim cities and finish them, you get a lot of points for them.
1085295	1086556	So it's kind of cool.
1086616	1090337	Like, I've got to play it on Xbox Live, but I'm afraid to because I know I'll get my ass handed to me.
1090378	1092959	But I guess that's the only way you're going to get better at a game like that.
1093239	1093339	So.
1094209	1095370	But I've been having fun playing it.
1095550	1097072	So, yay Carcassonne.
1097993	1098994	That's it for my gaming week.
1099934	1103117	So we will move from our gaming weeks to some housekeeping.
1103698	1109764	First off, we want to thank, or congratulate, I should say, one of our long-time listeners, DDR Angel.
1110444	1112426	I don't know if you remember DDR Angel.
1112466	1113047	I should hope so.
1113067	1113747	Not at all!
1113767	1114428	I should hope so.
1114528	1115369	She was here for the longest time.
1115609	1116330	She got married today.
1116980	1125911	So I want to say congratulations to Miss DDR Angel and her husband who, by the way, goes online, I believe, by Big Red Pimp.
1126873	1128795	So now she's DDR Pimp Lady?
1128975	1130337	Yes, now she's DDR Pimp.
1130798	1133361	So congratulations to Miss DDR Pimp.
1134997	1137538	Also, no show next week.
1137798	1139378	We're not going to be doing any show next week.
1139418	1142399	There may be a best of or something that shows up on the archives if there's time.
1142779	1148001	But unfortunately, just due to other obligations, there will be no show on July 29th.
1148401	1149461	So we're very sorry about that.
1150641	1152482	DarkSakura is going to Disneyland again.
1153662	1155803	I am, and I'm going to be high as a kite there too.
1156143	1159064	And usually we would just go ahead and do a show if one of us is gone.
1159344	1161064	But also, we're moving.
1161264	1163605	This is the very last show you're going to hear from studio number three.
1164232	1167113	Which we've had, you know, a good couple of years here.
1167133	1169254	We've been here for about two years in this tiny little room.
1170114	1175456	But the show, basically, if you haven't caught on, takes place in my spare bedroom at my apartment.
1175996	1182318	And in a couple weeks it will take place in the spare bedroom or maybe garage, haven't figured it out yet, at my new house.
1182598	1183899	So I'm very excited about that.
1184239	1185039	Kind of moving on up.
1185859	1188160	So we will be in the new studio soon.
1188180	1189200	That will be studio number four.
1190181	1192982	So, yes, the show has been a lot of places over the past five years.
1193042	1193882	So we're excited about that.
1194423	1195705	It's kind of like a horror.
1196526	1197087	What do you mean?
1197107	1198769	Because it gets around a lot.
1198789	1200972	Yeah, a little bit.
1202013	1205938	To use a friend of mine's analogy, we're like the house broom.
1205958	1209103	Everyone's had a ride.
1210284	1210785	Oh, I get it.
1212882	1213822	Alright, well here's the thing.
1214563	1219505	Also, we're looking to kind of relaunch of sorts in a couple weeks.
1220025	1229010	Not like we're going to totally redo the show, but maybe try out some new things like some new album art, some new openings, some new incidental sounds and stuff that play throughout the show.
1229390	1239035	So if you are an artistic or audio editing type, please shoot us an email because we'd be interested in what you can do for us in regards to...
1240712	1243935	New intros and new artwork and all that good stuff.
1243995	1248319	So more to come in two weeks when we return with more Orange Lounge Radio.
1249100	1251262	For now though, let's get to the gaming news for this week.
1251662	1253844	And I believe Loki's going to start us off tonight.
1254084	1254325	Yes.
1255366	1262112	So this week there is a bunch of news coming out of Japan during their PlayStation Premiere event in Tokyo.
1262652	1262792	And...
1264031	1267454	Some interesting things coming out, mostly stuff that we're not going to see over here.
1268054	1271397	One of which is a TV tuner for the PSP.
1271717	1281505	It's actually a one-seg tuner device, and kind of attaches to the top via the USB port, much like the GPS receiver and camera.
1282126	1286849	And apparently you can tune into different TV stations and whatnot.
1286869	1288511	It's supposed to be coming out in September.
1290052	1290773	And that's kind of cool.
1290793	1292414	I wish we'd get something like that over here.
1294810	1295810	Me something third party.
1297170	1301031	I know, why is it that we're not getting any of that kind of stuff over here?
1301051	1308193	Well, the GPS never came out over here either, and I don't think the camera did either, so maybe we're just not into all those extra purpose.
1308213	1309433	Who would use it over here?
1310033	1313014	I know we care about high-tech gadgets over here, but not like Japan does.
1313334	1317535	That's why we get two colors of things, sometimes three, and Japan gets 158 versions a week.
1320106	1321767	But TVs are kind of cool.
1321847	1322228	I don't know.
1322708	1324269	I might make the PSP a little more lucrative.
1324569	1325590	It depends on how much it costs.
1325750	1326791	How much does it cost in Japan?
1327452	1331074	It was 6,900 yen.
1331395	1333136	That's about, what, $69, right?
1333156	1334677	If I'm not mistaken.
1334797	1335177	Yeah.
1336018	1337379	Roughly around there.
1338020	1338300	Alright.
1339221	1342223	Oh, by the way, it's only compatible with the new PSP.
1343284	1343884	Not the old one.
1344084	1347627	Not that it really matters because in September it's going to be replacing all the old ones anyways.
1348564	1349625	G, Sony likes to do that.
1349865	1350666	Replace old stuff.
1350906	1354730	Well, yeah, like, they're the only company out there that redesigns their systems.
1355591	1356913	Nintendo, I'm looking at you.
1358014	1358314	Alright.
1358574	1360917	But they make them better, and in better colors.
1361576	1366277	Speaking of better colors, there are more PSP color variations coming out in Japan.
1366818	1367678	You know how we're getting what?
1367698	1369118	We're getting like three colors here?
1369378	1371279	Two colors in the Star Wars.
1371439	1383702	Okay, well over there they're getting Piano Black, Ceramic White, and Ice Silver, but they're also getting the Bloom series with Rose Pink, Lavender Purple, and Felicia Blue.
1384803	1385923	I want that blue one so bad.
1386443	1388804	But this sounds like Bubble Bath Salts.
1389930	1391250	That's so pretty.
1391470	1398252	This sounds like something a housewife would pour in her bathtub and say, Calgon, take me away.
1398332	1400032	PS, Sony, take me away.
1400052	1403113	You can't have salt in bubbles because it would not make bubbles.
1403873	1404473	Well, whatever.
1405313	1408714	But still, I'm getting bath salts and bubble baths mixed up.
1408894	1409254	Okay.
1409674	1415315	So that's six variants on the new PSP, and they already had at least four of the regular PSP variants.
1416189	1420590	And so I can't help but feel we're really getting shafted when Sony is doing better over here than they are in Japan.
1421531	1425572	Well, it is launching in Japan on September 29th at 19,800 yen.
1425812	1429313	And any of those colors that you want.
1429673	1431514	There's also some new accessories coming out.
1432034	1436315	AV cable, super video cable, D cable, component cable.
1436635	1437656	Now that's pretty awesome.
1437696	1439796	There's a component cable coming out for the video out.
1440017	1440597	Yes, there is.
1440737	1441497	That's pretty rad.
1441977	1442937	It'll do 480p.
1443598	1444598	God, now I want one.
1445273	1449576	Just for the video out so I can play Silent Hill Origins.
1449716	1453418	I can play the Akumajo Dracula compilation game that's coming out.
1455119	1455320	What?
1456040	1456380	Nothing.
1456600	1456881	Whatever.
1457241	1458982	I can play all that crap on the TV.
1459122	1459522	I'm very excited.
1459542	1461524	I've been playing that game for a long time already.
1461664	1463465	But it's sexy, sexy remake.
1464245	1465386	But the original's better.
1465746	1466087	Whatever.
1466147	1466647	It's pretty.
1466887	1467147	Shush.
1467167	1469329	The original has Maria's crappy singing in it.
1470089	1471330	Well, maybe the remake will have Maria's crappy singing.
1471450	1472551	One of her weapons is a songbook.
1473143	1499662	And she kills things by going la la la la la la Like that Wow, I think I almost died a little right then That's exactly what her voice sounds like too Well, anyway Don't do that Anyway Anyway I'm sorry I'm all giggly today No, there is a little bit of good news for our friends in Europe The PSP will actually be out there at the beginning of September And in Japan it will be there on September 20th So
1500834	1501794	You guys get it first.
1501834	1503415	You can just go rub it in everybody's face.
1504075	1506235	So Europe actually gets something first for once.
1506475	1508856	They got stuff first before, remember?
1508876	1509516	A few games.
1509776	1511816	Well, but... Konami loves Europe for some reason.
1511836	1512957	They get a lot of the cool stuff.
1512997	1514317	This has nothing to do with Konami.
1514637	1517198	No, but it's... Europe does get stuff first sometimes.
1517698	1518378	Once in a while.
1518878	1525199	But the price is going to be the same as the current one, so it's $129.99.
1525679	1526720	What colors are they getting?
1527120	1528080	It does not say.
1528100	1528160	Aww.
1530453	1551517	Also, and not much of a surprise since we're getting the stupid Star Wars PSP over here, that Japan would get something a little bit cooler in the special Final Fantasy VII system set, which will be coming out bundled with Crisis Core and has some fancy Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core artwork on it.
1552258	1554218	Also, it's going to be a limited production.
1554238	1556018	They're only making 77,777 units.
1560407	1561528	You know why that is, right?
1562028	1566511	Because it's Final Fantasy VII, and it's not because VII is the most powerful magic number.
1566731	1568031	It's beside that, actually.
1569252	1579218	In Final Fantasy VII, I've only heard of this happening, if you got your hit points all to VII, then you did some special attack in the game.
1579798	1582120	The special attack was called, Go Outside!
1582140	1586202	And to buy more sequels of this game when it comes out.
1587062	1587923	I'm gonna find it.
1589363	1592626	I'm just looking at chat room now and going back to some old comments here.
1592966	1596228	TheRobD says, I want to see Maria and Kirby in a sing-off.
1597149	1599491	No, because... No.
1599811	1601792	DarkTetsuya wants to add Jigglypuff to that.
1602573	1602833	No.
1603013	1603774	Jigglypuff.
1603814	1605775	Because Maria sings worse than all of them.
1606896	1607276	Let's see.
1607496	1609838	And ChainsawJuggling said, I did that once.
1609918	1610699	It was awesome.
1610739	1613301	In reference to the Lucky Sevens there.
1613821	1614962	See, I knew it was in there.
1615757	1620167	DrewNami says, 777HP, send your character into a constant attack mode.
1621149	1622252	Yeah, it's awesome.
1623715	1623976	All right.
1624409	1634297	Well, even though they are getting that super cool Final Fantasy VII slim thing PSP in Japan, everybody is hopefully getting this.
1634397	1637699	It's an expansion to Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.
1638100	1646306	Of course, a lot of folks are big fans of this game on the PSP because it wasn't Metal Gear Acid, and it was actually more like the other Metal Gear games, so a lot of folks are really into this.
1646626	1648828	Metal Gear Acid, though, had the cool 3D thing.
1649929	1651390	Cool is relative in that game.
1651410	1652571	Cool or headache in Duceen.
1653312	1653572	I know.
1654068	1659249	If I wear that thing too long, I would definitely have to take some Vicodin for the headaches I'm going to be getting after using that too much.
1659669	1660229	So there you go.
1661089	1671331	Now, IGN is actually reporting from the PlayStation Premiere event in Tokyo that this new portable ops game is going to have some online play, and that's going to be kind of its focus.
1671831	1681593	There's going to be some new characters, possibly an older version of Snake, and there's only going to be a little bit more as far as the single-player mode goes, the Infinity Mission version.
1681913	1685015	Otherwise, it's the good old-fashioned Metal Gear Solid portable ops that you're used to.
1685075	1688697	They do have Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid 4 in there.
1689017	1689758	He's in the trailer.
1690138	1690478	Awesome.
1691259	1693120	September 20th is the day that comes out.
1693200	1693520	Hmm.
1694101	1696742	I seem to remember something else is coming out that day in Japan as well.
1697983	1698363	There it is.
1698743	1703046	Probably take a little bit longer for it to come out here, though, because, you know, Konami hates you.
1703186	1709610	And they did some little thing in the video where it's like Power Rangers for the trailer.
1710736	1712237	That makes me want to play it now.
1712397	1712877	Dang it.
1714238	1723243	Other stuff for anyone who cares is that there is actually going to be Metal Gear Solid Online for PS3.
1723303	1728025	They had a little demo of it out when they did the Metal Gear Solid 4 thing.
1728905	1730426	So if anybody cares, there you go.
1730846	1735989	You can all wander around with boxes over your heads and your truck can start to move.
1738246	1741488	Could Metal Gear Solid ever be a first-person shooter someday?
1742089	1742469	It was.
1743210	1743450	When?
1744691	1749034	Do you remember the VR missions?
1749194	1750435	Oh, no.
1750655	1754038	It came out with a first-person version of Metal Gear Solid.
1754678	1762264	It just kind of makes me think, with all this online and all that stuff, could this be like a new Halo for a certain audience?
1762424	1762824	I don't know.
1763204	1763925	It's a little silly.
1765305	1769527	I would say it's more like Splinter Cell or, you know, Ghost Recon, something Tom Clancy-ish.
1769788	1775511	But I don't know, I think I'd play it a lot if it was, I don't know, Metal Gear Solid is one of those series, but I don't get into the Tom Clancy games as much.
1775551	1776512	I don't get into the Metal Gear games.
1776532	1777892	I don't get into that stuff either.
1778032	1779934	Like, the old-ass Metal Gear I used to love.
1779974	1780874	My spouse does.
1781735	1783215	I don't get into those games as much.
1784296	1789039	Although, the Solid Eye, it would be kind of cool to implement that into our website.
1790119	1790520	The what?
1790820	1793521	The Solid Eye for the, you know, Metal Gear Acid 2.
1793561	1794202	That, that,
1794858	1795939	HALO SUCKS GEARS OF WAR IS AMAZING
1823900	1824541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1842816	1850417	Well, there's some interesting commentary about the whole thing coming from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's president, David Reeves.
1850917	1858219	In fact, he's actually been on record saying, you know, the difference between 60 and 80 gigabytes is very small.
1859359	1862559	We just feel like going up 20 gigabytes is not worth it.
1863039	1864840	If you're going to double it, then it's worth it.
1865160	1870161	So basically, obviously he's commenting on the fact that I don't think the 80 gig system is coming to Europe.
1870201	1872081	I think they're going to be doing something a little bit larger.
1872941	1878566	But at the same time he's saying, oh by the way, yeah, you probably don't need to buy it for another extra 20 gigs.
1878666	1882630	Why doesn't he just admit, we don't have 20 gigs worth of shit for you to put on here?
1883270	1886073	There really is not that much stuff to download.
1886233	1887154	That's what I don't get.
1888778	1896983	I would think, now I don't know, I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner and I haven't been reading out very well, but does the PlayStation 3 allow you to play movies from your computer?
1897083	1898004	Yeah.
1898104	1898504	Anything?
1898644	1899465	Like any type of movie?
1900005	1902326	It's limited, but you can play stuff from your computer.
1902346	1904488	Can you copy them to the PlayStation 3 drive or anything?
1904748	1908630	You can't download them from your network and copy them, but you can download some on there.
1908650	1913754	Like I have a ripped copy of Kung Pao on my hard drive that I can play off there.
1914094	1915975	But nothing officially endorsed by Sony, right?
1917395	1919876	I don't think there's any movies that you can download from Sony.
1920016	1927121	Like, let's say on my Xbox 360, I can watch WMV files of a certain type over the network and watch them on my TV, right?
1927481	1927641	Yeah.
1927861	1930103	But on the Sony, I can do that with certain other types of movies?
1930403	1930583	Yeah.
1930783	1942411	Why doesn't Sony just blow the door wide open on that and just leave it unlimited to what you can, like, put all the different codecs in there to what you can watch, and people would, like, love that, and they could copy movies to their drive and everything.
1942851	1944392	I don't know, am I being absurd?
1944632	1965742	I never understood why they bumped it up from 60 to 80 anyways, because I guess unless a lot of games really install themselves onto the drive, like I remember Ridge Racer did that, and Oblivion I know does that, but I don't have that many PlayStation 3 games, so I can't say if they all do that, but if they did all do that, then yeah, that would fill up pretty quick, but
1966400	1968041	Raven's Dolphin says, What?
1968061	1969641	Sony is telling the truth for once.
1969781	1970961	And theRobD says, MPAA, Sky.
1989761	1991583	But the MPAA, you know what, they can't control.
1991603	1995708	What if I have a video I shoot on my digital camera that I want to watch over on the TV?
1996188	1997329	You know, they can't control that.
1997830	1998571	F the MPAA.
1999612	2002075	Anyway, those comments coming from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2003827	2006149	Something else maybe that could be a downloadable title.
2006189	2006549	I don't know.
2006589	2009831	The early screenshots I'm seeing of this game look very simplistic.
2010591	2014613	It's from the creator of Katamari Dimashii, Keita Takahashi.
2015554	2018856	You might remember he said he was taking a break to work on Playgrounds.
2018996	2019416	Remember that?
2019476	2022618	Like he supposedly ended Katamari Dimashii to go make Playgrounds.
2022898	2030543	Well, I don't know if he finished or what's going on, but he has released information about a new game for the PlayStation 3, Nobi Nobi Boy.
2031103	2033484	Now, nobi means stretch in Japanese.
2034165	2042490	So, in the early screenshots, definitely looked like this big stretching, I don't know, turdy caterpillar thing stretching around.
2042550	2049634	So, there's very little information on this right now, but we do know that the creator of Katamari no Washi is making a new game for the PlayStation 3.
2050475	2051035	That's about it.
2051832	2060879	So that's kind of interesting because a lot of folks on PlayStation 3 were really sad because there has been no news about Beautiful Katamari coming out to their system.
2061319	2064162	In fact, now it looks like that whole project may have been scrapped.
2064522	2069065	So maybe they'll get this new project instead, which could be somewhat redemption for them.
2069186	2069526	I don't know.
2069886	2070487	Kind of interesting.
2070747	2072048	I think they're beyond redemption.
2072448	2073449	They deserve to burn.
2074096	2074316	No.
2075897	2085423	Speaking of things that deserve to burn, Gran Turismo Prologue is going to be available for Japanese PlayStation Network in October.
2085663	2086944	We don't get it yet.
2089305	2093888	It will have online multiplayer and has an undetermined price.
2095029	2095909	It is not free.
2096770	2097010	Great.
2097030	2098010	You get to pay for a demo.
2098051	2098651	That's awesome.
2100332	2103714	I just say it's more freaking cars, so whatever.
2104451	2105432	Project Gotham is more fun.
2105452	2108653	Why don't you release an actual game instead of all these demos?
2109273	2109954	That's what I think.
2111435	2125602	Another game that's coming out to PlayStation 3, or at least was announced, Disgaea 3 looks very similar to all the other Disgaea games, and sadly enough, the graphics also look similar to the other Disgaea games, meaning that they're not that great.
2125782	2127463	But, hey, it's Disgaea.
2127783	2128523	It's another game.
2129424	2129884	Hurrah.
2129964	2131985	Yeah, Disgaea was never really about the graphics, though.
2132805	2136826	It was about the hilarious voice acting and the stories and, you know, the game itself.
2137227	2138607	It was a pretty awesome strategy game.
2138647	2139527	It looks okay.
2139747	2141608	I mean, I don't know.
2142468	2148770	I would think, though, that if they're going to step up to PlayStation 3, they're going to do something with the graphics, make them uber sharp or, you know.
2149431	2154052	It does look a little sharper, but then again, the screenshot's so small, I don't really know.
2155973	2156473	Well, there you go.
2157739	2162402	Also coming for the PlayStation 3 at some point, someday, Tekken 6.
2163683	2164984	Tekken 6 is going to be coming out.
2165764	2166285	I'm sorry.
2167265	2168366	I didn't say it in the mic, though.
2168666	2169847	Oh.
2170447	2173249	Tekken 6 is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3.
2174490	2179673	And, of course, Virtua Fighter is going to have online on the Xbox 360, so it just makes sense.
2180133	2181314	Yeah, the Virtua Fighter sucks.
2181334	2183456	PlayStation should have something going for it.
2183936	2185177	And that's going to be Tekken 6.
2186808	2194154	Namco Bandai answered at PlayStation Premiere in Tokyo that they will have an online capability.
2194334	2197336	You know, I don't think that these should really be announcements anymore.
2197517	2200579	I think it should always be an online game.
2200619	2206204	I mean, this is what we... Microsoft doesn't go out there and announce, hey, this game's going to be online.
2206704	2208326	Most of the games are online.
2208886	2211488	It's not something that you really need to announce.
2212209	2213310	Just get with it, Sony.
2214165	2215866	or hell, get with it, Namco.
2215886	2218027	I mean, you should... Yeah, because... Putting everything online.
2218067	2218968	It's not Sony's fault.
2219408	2226612	There was this big to-do about Soul Calibur finally going online too and everybody's just kind of like, yeah, the last one really should have been online.
2227693	2228013	Right?
2229634	2230114	So, I don't know.
2231995	2235977	That's like saying, you know, you know, oh, Tekken 6 is going to be in high definition.
2236838	2237638	Okay.
2238459	2239039	Great.
2240320	2242621	I thought it was supposed to be since it's on, you know...
2243311	2243911	DarkSakura.com
2273243	2278666	So I picked a version of a site I picked before, and it's ROFLcats.com.
2279646	2282788	It's more LOLcats, so there you go.
2283588	2291712	More Caturday to spread the badly grammar, spelling, cat captioning fun.
2291792	2294333	Because we've really not had any of that on this show ever.
2294714	2295654	Not in a long time.
2296875	2300476	This is some pretty funny stuff, because it has a couple of my favorites on here.
2301217	2301417	Like...
2303288	2304569	The Justice System or Fucking Screwed SuperCat
2320853	2321574	I don't know.
2321794	2322234	I don't know.
2322874	2326936	I like going to KittenWar.com or whatever it's called.
2326956	2328377	That gets me through the day sometimes.
2328657	2329377	KittenWar?
2329617	2336280	Yeah, because it's like a rate your cat site and they put two pictures of cats up and you say which one's cuter.
2337201	2338121	It's adorable.
2338301	2338921	That sounds like fun.
2338981	2339542	Okay, one more.
2341022	2342163	Oh, now that's funny.
2342383	2342743	That's funny.
2342783	2346265	See, it's a picture of Winnie the Pooh and he's saying, Tigger, please.
2347305	2347725	Get it?
2348226	2348806	That's funny.
2348826	2349166	I get it.
2349947	2350247	All right.
2350507	2352208	Your psych is then acceptable.
2352368	2353368	I will allow the psych.
2353968	2355229	Is Rob pleased with my offering?
2355629	2358250	I have a... Sealing Cat is very pleased with your offering.
2360291	2361071	Next story, please.
2361491	2362331	I don't get that crap.
2362891	2364292	Anyways, it's not surprising.
2364312	2365892	We talked a little bit about this last week.
2366913	2376216	There was a survey that went out to all the attendees of E3 this year, kind of asking them their opinions on certain things that they're possibly going to change for next year.
2377409	2398256	of the following they were offering new locations including Santa Monica, San Diego, Laguna Beach, San Francisco or LA also they were prefer our question was do you prefer to see the summit held in multiple hotel settings like it was this year or a convention center type larger facility setting
2398840	2407382	I know I'll probably speak for Bobby in saying larger facility convention center type setting instead of having to drive between hotels.
2408142	2414843	And it says also they're talking about what month you'd like, you know, options included May through August.
2417063	2421424	And then, of course, if you didn't visit Barker Hanger or the Fairmont Hotel, why not?
2422844	2423904	I hope it comes to San Francisco.
2423924	2425065	Because I was stuck in traffic.
2425945	2426765	I wasn't invited.
2426785	2427005	Exactly.
2427443	2428864	I've never flown to LA for a convention.
2454008	2458512	I swear I'll only fly to LA ever again because I hate that drive.
2458933	2459634	It's so horrible.
2460074	2461595	I drive great on that drive.
2462877	2464598	It is the most boring drive.
2465299	2466080	It is pretty boring.
2466120	2466840	You probably take the 5.
2468294	2470856	Yeah, 5 is pretty boring, but 99 is not much better.
2471616	2474338	99 has great truck stops on the way and you meet all kinds of colorful people.
2474398	2479021	It's like 5 is like field, field, field, field, mountain, field, field, field.
2479041	2479602	Pooh smell.
2480162	2480322	And cow.
2480362	2480762	Cow.
2481163	2483885	Did you do it by, what was it that Marissa called it?
2484225	2485065	Cowschwitz.
2485345	2485846	Cowschwitz.
2487267	2488207	The town of Koalinga.
2488648	2489188	Beautiful stuff.
2489248	2489488	Anyway.
2492605	2495387	TheRobD is saying, they've never driven in Illinois, have they?
2495608	2496408	Hostile1 or Misty.
2496428	2498690	I hear that people in Illinois don't know how to drive at all.
2500332	2503754	SonofDad says, E308 in Vegas for the win.
2504535	2506477	I would not mind E308 in Vegas.
2506497	2507678	I don't think Vegas would work.
2508118	2508679	Why not?
2508759	2509459	But it's Vegas.
2510360	2521009	Well, they just did, was it the ESA thing there, or EMA, I can't remember what it is, the video kind of, their big
2521889	2529616	Actdeft says E3 in Mexicali, Mexico Hell yeah, E3 in Mexico Let's have it in Tijuana, that would rock
2539238	2540839	I'm going to go to Mexico this year.
2541219	2541579	For what?
2542480	2543600	World Pump Finals.
2543840	2546582	They moved it out of Korea this year and they're putting it in Mexico.
2546702	2552005	So I'm going to have to bring soap and something to keep the dirtiness away.
2552125	2553005	And a water filter.
2553025	2554726	You guys are horrible!
2555947	2558168	I'm sure those stereotypes are not true at all.
2558288	2562170	They should have Konami's Gamer Day at Easter Island.
2564491	2565272	It's so fitting.
2566303	2569185	Blaze says E3 in Canada so Rob can get more maple cookies.
2569225	2569866	I like that idea.
2571107	2571647	E3 in Canada.
2571708	2573309	That requires leaving.
2573629	2576192	Nothing against Canada, but they're not going to have anything up there ever.
2578734	2580175	They have red PlayStations.
2580295	2582237	I love Canada, but I wouldn't.
2582457	2586721	To Brad, I will take California drivers over Alabama drivers any day.
2588103	2589124	And Florida drivers.
2589324	2589984	May I move on?
2590765	2591706	May I do a new story now?
2592475	2592815	No.
2593456	2598040	One thing you might remember we were all giddy about on this program about a year ago was the Silent Hill movie.
2598380	2599481	I remember Silent Hill came out.
2599501	2602704	We were all excited because it was Pyramid Head, like right there.
2602724	2603645	I saw it four times.
2605796	2606576	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2635445	2647704	Oh god, I hope he's available Somebody just needs to shoot that man in the head You have to understand that Silent Hill now will be set in the jungle on an island There'll be a rave there
2648141	2655006	Someone needs to strap that man down and lobotomize the section of his brain that controls writing movies.
2655886	2656787	Oh, wait, they already did.
2656827	2658168	That explains his last few movies.
2658468	2663451	Well, anyway, since Christophe Gann is not on the next film, Roger Avery took a hike as well.
2664312	2674899	Now, see, what's going on is that Gann has said to a French magazine, DVD Ranma, that the sequel was ordered by Sony, but he's kind of too busy with other movies like Onimusha.
2675499	2677661	which he's adapting that game as well, obviously.
2678241	2679142	So he can't do it.
2679242	2686027	He said this, quote, If I cannot take on Silent Hill 2 myself, the director who does would need to continue in the same style as the first film.
2686467	2687528	Does that make you excited, Shane?
2688188	2689669	Except not crappy.
2689749	2691110	He did get the style right.
2691290	2696914	One does not want to make a Hollywood-style movie, and I think that it makes sense if the director of the sequel is European.
2696954	2699016	In the best-case scenario, French.
2701537	2702158	So there it is.
2702973	2707539	and Roger Avery said if I'm not going to do Silent Hill 2, if Kristoff's not going to do it.
2708179	2708740	That's fine.
2708760	2709541	We don't need them.
2709901	2711984	They should just go the way of the Resident Evil movies.
2712124	2717030	I know Resident Evil's bad because they don't really follow, well, anything.
2717535	2726202	It's kind of gone on its own tangent, but it'd be cool if Silent Hill kind of took over the world and then you have people trying to survive all these mutated evil things.
2726462	2728564	Not everybody enjoyed the Silent Hill movie, though.
2728684	2729605	I know a lot of people didn't.
2729665	2730446	I liked it, though.
2730526	2732107	Well, then they could just make a sequel for me.
2732668	2733088	Exactly.
2734029	2735030	They should have me write it.
2735370	2737031	It just stars Pyramid Head.
2737251	2739432	Seriously, they should have me write it.
2739512	2740912	I will write the Silent Hill movie.
2740992	2742433	It's Pyramid Head gone wild.
2742853	2750757	Honestly, they just need to look at the second game and then take the dialogue and then add some scenes where the action takes place and there you got your second movie.
2750997	2758761	But what I don't want it to turn into is I don't want Silent Hill series to turn into like the Halloween series where it's just like Pyramid Head kills everything.
2759161	2762963	You know, Pyramid Head at summer camp killing lovely young ladies.
2763547	2766468	Now, if they wanted a spin-off series, I'm all fine with that.
2768188	2769869	Freddy vs. Jason vs. Pyramid Head?
2770409	2773170	Oh, you know they'd both die, because Pyramid Head's awesome.
2773190	2774490	That'd be awesome.
2774970	2777191	Because nobody can kill Pyramid Head.
2777231	2778991	He has to end up offing himself.
2780672	2783953	Son of Dad says a Luc Besson Silent Hill would own.
2784493	2785773	Wasn't he the guy that did the fifth element?
2786393	2787074	That'd be pretty hot.
2787114	2787954	That would be hot.
2788614	2789074	Maybe.
2789694	2790055	Maybe.
2791035	2791515	We shall see.
2793260	2821623	Bruce Willis as Pyramid Head No, Bruce Willis versus Pyramid Head, that would be fun Sean McLean versus Pyramid Head Die Hard 5 They'd just take out the whole fucking world between them Okay, so guess what else, speaking of weird bizarreness That episode of South Park where they did the World of Warcraft thing which I finally saw two days ago is up for an Emmy
2822506	2826189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2845923	2846484	Hey, shut up.
2846964	2852787	And I was so bored that I decided to watch the South Park episode of World of Warcraft.
2853328	2854549	The other way around, you know what I mean?
2854709	2856049	Did it live up to your expectations?
2856390	2862273	It was kind of funny, but there was stuff that was wrong, but I did think it was, Your son's character is going to die!
2862493	2863594	I was like, oh shit.
2864315	2864795	Mom!
2864815	2865195	Bathroom!
2865916	2866276	Bathroom!
2866756	2870879	I know people who get like that and it's so stupid, so I thought it was funny.
2872079	2873140	So does it deserve an Emmy?
2873917	2874257	No.
2874738	2876679	What's the Emmy for?
2877459	2879040	I don't know.
2879840	2881021	This is nominated for one.
2881241	2882862	It just got nominated for one.
2882882	2883222	Who cares?
2883242	2888145	It gets the Poop Award for animated defecation.
2890806	2891086	Awesome.
2892107	2895469	Well, there's going to be some good stuff coming out this week.
2897070	2899211	Not a whole lot, but some pretty good stuff.
2900134	2910380	In the US, if you're a fan of the NASCAR series, you'll be happy to know there's a new game coming out from EA, NASCAR 08, on PlayStation 2, 360, and the PlayStation 3.
2912121	2919645	Also on PlayStation 2 this week, Shimogane Tensei Persona 3, which I meant to play this week, but it never got around to it.
2920005	2921005	That is also coming out.
2921446	2926208	And then a small little game called Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s.
2926648	2929070	That's going to be making its way out on PlayStation 2.
2930271	2938894	and then let's see here on the PSP we have Final Fantasy 2 which I'm trying to finish Final Fantasy 1 so I can play this.
2940195	2944396	Alien Syndrome is going to be coming out on the Wii and PSP.
2945717	2952800	Also a weird game from Eidos called Escape from Bug Island which you may know as Necronasia.
2953700	2957141	Wasn't very good in Japan so now it's mediocre over here.
2958562	2958742	And
2960302	2965367	I'm not really surprised at this, but yet another Tycoon games coming out on PC.
2966248	2975056	Ride, Carnival Tycoon, and yeah, Let's Ride Friends Forever, yet another horse riding game.
2976458	2977859	Yay, horse riding games.
2977919	2979941	And Dynasty Warriors DS on the DS, of course.
2979961	2981763	I totally misheard that title, by the way.
2982728	2983448	What did you hear it as?
2984208	2985909	Let's, what, ride friends?
2986149	2986549	I don't know.
2986629	2987810	Let's ride friends.
2988290	2989910	Let's ride friends forever.
2992331	2993651	Let horses ride friends.
2994112	2994832	That's wrong.
2995232	2996032	No.
2996072	2996812	Where is your mind?
2997413	2998933	Are you sure you're only on bike getting?
2999233	2999833	I'm sure.
3000373	3004975	And Civilization IV Expansion Pack will also be coming out this week as well.
3006175	3007356	Civ IV Beyond the Sword.
3008016	3008316	All right.
3008911	3009672	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
3034932	3037254	The Last Time I Played It The Controls Were Tight Enough
3063458	3078566	Also coming out in Japan, Mario Party 8, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, and some jigsaw puzzle games coming out from Hudson Entertainment, Mobile Suit Gundam, and just for you, Jamie, Puyo Puyo 15th Anniversary.
3078806	3079867	I love Puyo Puyo!
3079967	3080847	On the Nintendo Wii.
3080927	3081848	Yeah, but seriously.
3082288	3084749	I mean, seriously, how many of those Puyo Puyo games have come out?
3084869	3086750	I have a bunch of Puyo Puyo games.
3086810	3090352	I even have the PC Engine one.
3091259	3099383	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Major League Baseball 2K7, Mina No Golf 5, and Wangan Midnight is coming out on the PlayStation 3.
3099683	3101964	Shit, I want to practically import that game.
3102465	3103265	That looks awesome.
3103785	3104666	I love the arcade series.
3104686	3107287	I saw screenshots for that, and I thought that was kind of interesting.
3108167	3110128	It looks like it's the first game, though.
3110168	3110508	I don't know.
3110889	3112529	How would you practically import it?
3112549	3113870	Like, just get the instruction book?
3113910	3114751	Well, because PlayStation 3 is...
3116246	3120008	He would put in his order with all sorts of practicality.
3120068	3125931	Like, if I'm going to rationalize getting a PlayStation 3, that's one of the games that would actually make me want to do it, because I love that arcade.
3125951	3129313	I don't know if it's region-free for the games, though.
3129533	3130134	That's the only thing.
3130234	3130954	God damn it.
3131394	3131995	I'm not sure.
3132215	3132935	Well, hold on.
3133075	3135416	I thought it was region-free for games, not for movies.
3135436	3137838	The site that's selling this says no region protection.
3138158	3138818	Well, then awesome.
3138858	3139959	I'm going to have to import that.
3140019	3140599	Fuck yeah.
3142000	3143341	Yeah, well, me too.
3143481	3144541	Well, fuck yeah twice.
3145262	3145602	Uh-uh.
3147474	3148435	I don't want to fuck you out twice.
3176770	3179852	Oh, also, another game goes into Sega Ages.
3179892	3184454	This would be Volume 30, Galaxy Force 2 in Japan.
3184975	3187936	Are you a big fan of Galaxy Force, DarkSakura?
3188156	3189317	Um, no.
3189517	3189837	I don't know.
3190778	3193159	Nintendo DS is getting a lot of games as well.
3193179	3195460	This is a big release week for games over there.
3195700	3199042	Taiko no Tatoujin on the DS is coming out over there.
3199642	3200463	And also...
3201087	3201767	This is great.
3201847	3202988	Another Hello Kitty game.
3203028	3208769	This one's called Hello Kitty No Ashare Party Sanrio Characters Zuken DS.
3210109	3210830	Isn't that a mouthful?
3211110	3214130	It's an action game, but it has all your favorite Hello Kitty characters.
3214171	3219432	I see Twinstar, I see Kuropi, but I don't see Batsmaru, so this game fails.
3221452	3223293	Let's see if there's anything on the PSP real quick.
3224204	3227968	Alex Silvara in the chatroom says, Wangan Midnight equals Maximum Tune 2.
3228428	3229489	No, not necessarily.
3229589	3231611	The box art doesn't say it's Maximum Tune 2.
3231651	3233613	It just calls it Wangan Midnight.
3233693	3234994	What if it's all-encompassing?
3235274	3236756	I don't know if it's all-encompassing or what it is.
3236856	3239839	That would be ideal, I would think, on the PlayStation 3.
3239899	3242161	I'll have to look up more information on this game.
3242801	3244442	Oh, are you looking that up right now?
3244582	3245403	Well, I was looking.
3245723	3249866	It is region-free, and it's not that expensive either, which is good.
3250306	3256170	I'm just like, I don't know if it's all in Japanese or something, because some of those games can actually be in English as well.
3256230	3257711	I just, I don't know.
3257731	3258451	I have to be careful.
3258652	3263515	Well, on the Sony PSP, you finally get Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories in Japan.
3263655	3264996	Capcom's bringing that to you.
3265036	3270099	I always think that's interesting how that works intercontinental there, how different companies can bring the games.
3271099	3276783	See, because the other game that I would like to get also maybe would be Folk Soul.
3277923	3278864	You know, like folklore.
3279745	3281306	That's going to be coming over here soon.
3281786	3283747	Well, that's all I got for Japanese releases.
3284247	3285108	Maybe I can get Laird.
3285128	3287810	Well, I have some European releases, but only a few.
3288430	3299357	We have Guilty Gear Dust Strikers on DS, Guilty Gear Judgment on PSP, and they're finally getting the Pokemans, Diamond and Pearl, which was also a Prince album.
3301144	3301504	I'm done.
3302565	3303165	Wow, that was quick.
3304085	3315531	Yeah, because there's other games listed to be announced titles, but, you know, there's nothing really specific, which I would assume that some of these would already be out, I would hope.
3315931	3317592	Like Saints Row is listed for PS3.
3318826	3326693	Okay, here's the deal with Wangan Midnight and all that, is that I'm looking at Wikipedia, and apparently this is actually the third game in the series.
3327173	3329795	So this would be like Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 3.
3330236	3334980	It's going to be a simultaneous release in the arcade, PlayStation 3, and PSP.
3335120	3335640	Hell yeah.
3335680	3336161	There it is.
3336821	3337582	That's pretty rad.
3338543	3339083	Sign me up.
3339664	3341765	That might be, I might try that.
3342986	3345769	Wouldn't it be amazing if they did that for like a good series?
3347711	3348693	You don't like that game?
3349134	3350717	I don't care about it, I've never played it
3351437	3352357	You've never played it?
3352397	3354178	Then how can you not get for that?
3354198	3355718	The soundtrack is amazing.
3355938	3356558	That's there.
3356598	3357298	I can not get for that.
3357338	3358999	It's got a Politeary song on it.
3359679	3360359	One Politeary song.
3360439	3363319	And it's good because it's No It's Usual Koshiro.
3363399	3365320	Is she like getting stabbed in the throat in it?
3365400	3365940	Maybe.
3366040	3366680	I doubt it.
3366780	3369881	It sounds like that in every song she sings I know, but I doubt it.
3369941	3370321	Let's see.
3370581	3373281	Drunami sets Miklatov on fire in chat.
3374182	3377282	SSJ100 Matt says, LOL Shane's being a dick tonight.
3377602	3378182	Tonight?
3382515	3384756	That's like I'm being a jerk again.
3385296	3386177	It never stops.
3386497	3386857	I know.
3387097	3387457	Gosh.
3388418	3389958	I always have something negative to say.
3390259	3394280	I wondered why we hadn't had you on this show in a long time, and then I remembered why.
3394480	3396041	Because I hate things and stuff.
3396841	3397942	You hate things and stuff.
3398122	3398742	And stuff.
3398862	3399403	Definitely.
3399743	3400263	And stuff.
3401063	3401644	And stuff.
3402084	3403364	Damn those things and stuff.
3404285	3404605	All right.
3404965	3405245	Anyways.
3405325	3406626	Can we move on to more news, please?
3406926	3407886	I want to end this segment.
3408747	3409847	So other things to hate...
3411901	3415522	X-07's gone, so where are we going to get some more news from Microsoft?
3415962	3417843	Well, eh, it's okay.
3417863	3420224	From rumors around the internet, because they're always true.
3420644	3421524	Exactly.
3421544	3422865	Hey, same goes with Sony.
3423885	3425006	We'll get into that a little bit later.
3425386	3431368	But anyways, yeah, there's no real X-07 this year, according to Microsoft exec Aaron Greenberg.
3432028	3438230	Instead, they are going to be trying to do some sort of other event that will be taking place in the UK.
3438270	3440571	So, yeah.
3441516	3441916	I don't know.
3441977	3442817	Other event?
3443578	3444940	Party at Chuck E. Cheese.
3444960	3447663	They don't have Chuck E. Cheese over there.
3447703	3449825	I want to go to Chuck E. Cheese.
3449985	3452268	Chuck E. Cheese is nasty pizza, though, but they do have good pizza.
3452288	3454790	Mike's Incredible, or John's Incredible Pizza, or whatever it is.
3454811	3455711	Yeah, that new one here?
3455732	3456252	Yeah, we should go there.
3456272	3457493	They don't have that in the UK either.
3457934	3460296	Do they have, like, Chuck E. Cheese type places in the UK?
3460337	3460837	What do they call it?
3460857	3462399	Do you have Pizza Time Theater, please?
3463109	3464289	Please email me right now.
3464309	3466470	I want to go to Chuck E. Cheese to go play Pump It Up.
3466590	3469891	I would figure you would know, Jamie, because you're up on your British culture.
3469911	3471832	But I don't care about Chuck E. Cheese.
3472152	3472532	Oh, right.
3472772	3475393	I haven't cared about Chuck E. Cheese since it was showbiz.
3475533	3477154	Maybe somebody will email us and tell us.
3477714	3479495	Let me know if you have Pizza Time Theater, please.
3480305	3480545	All right.
3480785	3488789	In fact, speaking of emails, we're going to get to the mailbag very shortly here and read the avalanche of emails that came into our mailbox this week at mailbag at orangehunter.com.
3488809	3489530	Thank you, everybody.
3489870	3492331	But first, this was a big story here.
3493212	3495133	Peter Moore has left Microsoft.
3495593	3495933	That's right.
3495953	3498615	Peter Moore has become very well known lately.
3498635	3501276	He's kind of like the face of Microsoft at a lot of these events.
3501576	3502156	Peter Moore, EA Sports
3526775	3528235	is what his new role is going to be.
3528335	3534737	So even though he's gone from working for a giant console maker to a publisher, that's still nothing to blink at.
3534777	3536077	That's still a very important role.
3536497	3537937	EA makes crap loads of money.
3538597	3545719	And if you're wondering who is going to replace Peter Moore, well, it's going to be Don Matrick, who comes from EA.
3546559	3547419	He's coming from EA.
3548119	3548599	So there you go.
3550220	3555861	And it'll be interesting to see if this has any type of changes on Microsoft's PR, but probably not.
3557093	3557693	Probably not really.
3557713	3559194	It's going to be the same old stuff.
3560654	3561115	Let's see.
3561415	3564316	Son of Dad says Peter Moore quit to go work at Showbiz.
3565857	3566477	Well, you know what's funny?
3566517	3568118	You know where Reggie Fils-Aimé came from?
3568158	3570198	You know one of the places he worked before he was at Nintendo?
3570378	3571479	Pizza Time Theater.
3571679	3571819	No.
3572279	3572920	Panda Express.
3573920	3574220	Really?
3574500	3574740	Yeah.
3575240	3576521	But I mean, look at, you know...
3577099	3578700	The Panda Express is nasty.
3578880	3580220	But it's everywhere now.
3580260	3581421	It's insanely popular.
3581781	3584282	So I don't know if that was his doing or what, but there you go.
3584622	3587583	No, it was the doing of people addicted to MSG.
3588344	3588684	Maybe.
3589444	3589704	All right.
3590224	3594386	Anyhow, we mentioned the mailbag's coming up, so let's get into the mailbag.
3594766	3597707	DarkSakura likes to read your emails that you send us every week.
3598148	3604030	Well, DarkSakura is forced at gunpoint to read your emails that you send to us twice a week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
3604370	3605791	So let's get out the old...
3606900	3610241	Gun, and I'll just shine up the gun and point it at Jamie's head.
3611102	3611802	No!
3612462	3613402	Let's read some emails.
3615223	3616023	Or I'm going to pull the trigger.
3616043	3617664	Hey, Rob.
3617784	3618024	What?
3618344	3620025	S-T-F-U-M-F.
3621225	3622085	I'll shoot the kitties.
3622546	3623586	I will shoot the caturday.
3624406	3624966	Oh, no.
3626027	3627647	Okay, we got two whole emails.
3628168	3631069	Thank you, people, because I can't really read very well right now.
3631089	3632189	Um...
3633268	3636992	I am heading to Anaheim, California from August 3rd through 7th for BlizzCon.
3637032	3638194	Okay, everybody look for this guy.
3639235	3640096	Are you guys going?
3640496	3643260	And if you are, I want to grab some food and a restaurant.
3643420	3644661	I want to grab a restaurant too.
3645903	3650067	And most likely other people from World of Warcraft Radio, I guess.
3650808	3652690	I hope you guys don't think... Okay, never mind.
3652710	3654032	This guy's just inviting us to lunch.
3655203	3657625	Who's that from?
3658025	3670196	SpeedyF40 Yeah, he's plugged the WoW radio thing before You know, if you were there the last weekend of this month, then you can go to Disneyland with me if you pay How does that work?
3670636	3675380	I am not going to BlizzCon, none of us are going to BlizzCon, but you know who is going to BlizzCon?
3677167	3678869	Blizzard is going to BlizzCon!
3690680	3694243	from his sister and her fiancé who both also play WoW in our guild.
3694663	3696024	So look for Extifer.
3696505	3702190	I actually want to send him with the tape recorder and microphone to do some interviews at BlizzCon because I think it would be hilarious.
3702290	3702850	He should.
3702950	3706353	So that's going to be your OLR representation at BlizzCon right there.
3706653	3712458	But unfortunately, because of the move and everything, it's too close to the finances for me.
3712478	3715661	It probably doesn't help also that all the tickets sold out within like a few hours.
3715681	3718043	That didn't help either, and I was out of town when they went on sale.
3718103	3719143	Otherwise, I might have bought one.
3719544	3719764	Oh, well.
3720717	3724400	It would be interesting to see me go to BlizzCon because I have no interest in World of Warcraft.
3725441	3729164	Drunami says if we hang out with WoW Radio, we should say hi to TotalBiscuit.
3729344	3731385	I don't know who that is, but I'm sure somebody listening does.
3731605	3733087	Hi, TotalBiscuit!
3734067	3735208	Can I read the next email, please?
3735228	3735609	You may.
3735849	3736149	Okay.
3736930	3738971	Hey, OLR crew, it's me, Neki.
3739411	3742154	Sorry I haven't emailed in a while, but I've been really busy.
3742474	3744215	Been loving the show recently, by the way.
3744315	3745656	Warning, this might be really long.
3746217	3747157	No, I've got longer.
3747438	3747758	Sorry.
3748462	3751203	You don't quite meet the longest email category.
3751803	3752663	I've seen longer.
3753204	3754344	I've seen plenty longer.
3754684	3755484	I've seen thicker.
3757745	3758646	Can I read, please?
3758726	3758986	Yes.
3759046	3760146	You perverted people.
3760526	3760766	What?
3760806	3761747	I was talking about emails.
3762187	3762507	Shut up.
3763107	3770129	Boo-hoo, my 360 died earlier this week, and although it's a pain in the ass, Microsoft is very good at cleaning this up.
3771230	3774371	I had to phone twice, second, because I forgot my original mobile, no.
3775793	3781718	But I was only on hold for at best 10 minutes each call, so thanks should go to Microsoft for their good support.
3782098	3786601	The extended warranty shows that they are taking responsibility for it, so I am understanding.
3787001	3792405	However, dot dot dot dot dot dot dot, the expected time I will get my Berk 360 back is over one month.
3792905	3796648	Also, did Microsoft say they have fixed the problem with the new Xbox 360s?
3797088	3799850	If so, I intended to shell out for a new 360 instead.
3802017	3807180	The good point to my 360 dying is that I finally have dug out my old PS2.
3807920	3811983	Some of the games seem unusual now and look bad graphics.
3812483	3818466	Another thing is that the PlayStation controllers seem tiny after using the Xbox 360 controllers alone for five to six months.
3818746	3820107	Dude, you want to see tiny?
3820487	3825890	Try playing with a dual analog controller for the Saturn and everything will look tiny to you.
3826331	3826791	Trust me.
3827869	3829489	Also, a note on email last week.
3829569	3832850	I fully support younger online players who are online.
3832930	3833690	I am now 15.
3833950	3841092	I can truthfully say that I am definitely more mature than other even 30-year-old players who use the N-word.
3842392	3845733	Anyway, I'm not going to let this go on really long, so bye, Neki.
3845773	3846153	P.S.
3846473	3848634	This is good gramming speller LOLs.
3849614	3854175	Well, I could point them out, but I'm not going to because I'm too doped up to be a bitch tonight.
3854835	3856436	and PPS, look for me in the chat room.
3856536	3857397	I saw you there.
3857437	3858498	I was going to say something.
3858578	3859158	Hi, Necky.
3860039	3860879	You're so lying.
3860919	3861420	You didn't look.
3861600	3862020	I did.
3862100	3864702	No, Necky popped in and I even voiced him.
3865062	3865282	All right.
3865302	3868805	And Necky is one of our listeners from the UK, so to be in our chat room right now.
3869205	3870486	Dude, your parents know you're up.
3872267	3875449	There was a question in there about the Xbox 360 and have they fixed... It's 3 a.m.
3875730	3878131	Well, have they fixed the problem on Xbox 360?
3878612	3879152	I believe they have.
3879192	3883375	Didn't they change the chips that were going in the Xbox 360 as part of to change that problem, Loki?
3883395	3883435	No.
3884033	3884474	Am I wrong?
3884814	3885735	They didn't change chips.
3885795	3891301	They changed the heat sinks that were on the graphics chips and stuff.
3891401	3895985	And all the new ones are being fixed, I guess.
3896085	3898448	So then the new system shouldn't have this problem.
3899349	3901571	Theoretically, unless there's something else that goes wrong.
3901951	3902232	All right.
3902912	3903853	Well, we'll see what happens.
3904374	3905215	So that's it for email.
3906354	3906654	Yes.
3907815	3908735	I have an email.
3908856	3913178	The Rob D in chat confirms they changed the heat sink so heat distribution is different.
3913578	3913979	There you go.
3914519	3915199	I have an email.
3915219	3915880	You have an email?
3915920	3917141	Yeah, I got it right here.
3917741	3918461	Okay.
3919042	3920923	It says Dear Orange Lounge Radio.
3921900	3922440	What's up?
3923380	3924741	I'm going to Comic Con.
3925521	3926681	It's going to be awesome.
3926721	3927621	Dude, this is you.
3928181	3931162	Because you told us this before the show.
3932182	3936623	Well, I thought maybe if you needed me to do something down there for you guys, I could.
3936803	3940564	Because I'm not going as part of any sort of group, except for the awesome group of Shane.
3940664	3942645	You have to hunt down Udon Crew for me.
3942665	3944465	I actually have a couple artists I want you to hunt down for me.
3944778	3946979	Yes, I have an assignment for you.
3946999	3951222	I'm not taking... No, no, on behalf of Orange Ons Radio, this is what I need you to do.
3951302	3960968	I want you to go down to Comic-Con, and I want you to go to the Heroes panel with a big burlap sack, and I want you to push Siler into the sack and bring him back to Sacramento with you.
3960988	3961848	How does that have to do with video games?
3961988	3962989	And then have him here.
3963249	3967772	It actually has nothing to do with video games, but it has to do with the wellness and well-being of our program.
3968412	3971993	Oh, but I already... He said, I want Siler here in my house when I get back.
3972013	3973394	I claimed Siler, I'm sorry.
3974695	3975075	You suck.
3975435	3976915	And all the BSG people I like.
3977315	3978576	Ooh, and the 4400 people I like.
3978616	3980717	You can have Helo, I just want Siler.
3980817	3982337	I totally get Helo.
3982577	3983098	There you go.
3984718	3988980	So, anybody going to Comic-Con to have fun, I'll be having fun for at least one of those days.
3989980	3992081	The Heroes and Battlestar Galactica panel days.
3992521	3994382	They do some video game stuff at Comic-Con, too, though, right?
3994402	3996203	Yeah, they have a Phoenix Wright thing that I'm going to go to.
3996263	3997143	And there's cosplayers.
3998152	4000253	Who I'll probably hit if they come near me.
4002193	4006134	And they'll probably have the cast of the new Who Wants to Be a Superhero where people get cash and prizes.
4006154	4007994	They have old Fat Mama or whatever.
4008014	4008795	She's going to be there.
4008875	4009395	Rockin'.
4009415	4010055	I love Fat Mama.
4010095	4010715	And somebody else.
4010815	4011295	I forget.
4011695	4012055	Awesome.
4013376	4013716	Let's see.
4013776	4018357	WonderDogHerald says, Miglatov should get the Comic-Con only Penny Arcade poster for OLR.
4019057	4019617	Yeah, why don't you do that?
4019837	4020257	Work on that.
4021017	4021217	What?
4021858	4022518	Penny Arcade?
4022718	4023278	I hate them.
4023658	4024078	Why?
4024378	4026159	They're really big jerks in real life.
4026319	4026839	I love them.
4028071	4033120	I was in line with one of the guys buying a hamburger at E3 two years ago.
4033140	4035645	Yeah, I've never had a bad experience.
4035665	4036747	What happened with you?
4036887	4037769	I was in the one-up...
4038647	4039928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4067321	4068982	Son of Dad says Comic Con will have a big Capcom presence.
4069002	4069462	If you like Capcom.
4089440	4089781	Devil May Cry 4
4098507	4099227	Oh, that's going to be there?
4099467	4099627	Yeah.
4099927	4100728	Oh, I'll go play that.
4101368	4110310	I really wasn't planning on doing anything video game related, except for some producer of the Ace Attorney series is going to be autographing things, and so that's why I want to go over to their booth.
4110770	4120272	And I know Konami's doing something, but I don't know if it's anything beyond Yu-Gi crap, so maybe some Silent Hill if I cross my fingers enough.
4120372	4124433	Do you think there might be anything Disney-related, possibly, that could show up?
4124793	4125113	I don't know.
4126016	4127117	Wonder what you're hinting at.
4127217	4127617	I don't know.
4127837	4130299	I don't know what you could possibly be hinting at.
4130339	4131620	I don't go on the internet ever.
4131640	4138085	Well, I just happen to know that Disney is a very popular cartoon series and could possibly have a relation there.
4138145	4138586	I don't know.
4139566	4140647	All right.
4142449	4145591	Let's go to a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4145871	4146912	We definitely need a break now.
4147692	4150775	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
