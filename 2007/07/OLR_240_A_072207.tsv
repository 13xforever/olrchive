161400	165040	first time listening so hello to all of you first-time listeners in chat it's
165040	167600	kind of a smaller audience in chat tonight though what I was thinking maybe
167600	171640	part of that is that people are reading Harry Potter right now they are they
171640	174760	should actually be done with it because it's been out for like two days so you
174760	180720	finished an hour before I before I left the house oh my gosh so you finished the
180720	184200	book about two hours ago so both of you finished the book yeah I finished about
184200	188880	this afternoon sometime and I don't read the books I would have been been done
188880	194560	last night but I had to play D&D I just wanted to get done with it because then
194560	199080	I could go back on the internet and not get spoiled by things I know I hate all
199080	203000	of you spoiler people yes and no spoilers in chat tonight don't even try
203000	205720	to be funny it's not cool so please don't ruin the book for those haven't
205720	209560	finished yet you know there's a lot to ruin I could kill I will Avada Kedavra
209560	214240	your ass I went directly to the spoiler page as soon as I found it you know I
214240	217560	don't know it's part of me I like to be spoiled and find out what's gonna happen
217560	220320	I don't even really read the book so watch the movies I haven't seen the
220320	222800	newest one in fact I didn't see the fourth one either but I like the first
222800	228480	three movies they're cool the fifth movie sucks now Jamie did you actually
228480	231920	go to the bookstore at midnight to buy the book no I was smart and went on
231920	236880	Amazon oh so you had to deliver to your house yes I went to Barnes and Noble
236880	243680	because I was also high on Vicodin I couldn't drive to the bookstore
243680	247280	although Dan said that he went to Walmart and almost bought me one the
247280	252480	Rob D says spoiler Jesus dies on page 681 oh you weren't looking for Bible
252480	258520	spoilers get it I think I saw that I think I saw that same joke on dig this
258520	264960	week failed I'm just kidding no but I went I went to Barnes and Noble at about
264960	269880	1030 on Friday and there were already a ton of people there because I wasn't
269880	273880	there to buy Harry Potter smelly people there was the fattest Hermione I'd ever
273880	278160	seen in my life was there actually so but I went bought the book for stardust
278160	281320	because I got to see a sneak preview of that movie that's coming out a couple
281320	285240	weeks stardust and I loved it it was like a video game I had Sky Pirates like
285240	288840	Final Fantasy 12 it was awesome and like magic and Michelle Pfeiffer was which it
288840	292720	was great so I I wanted to get the book that it was based on and they had it at
292720	296480	Barnes and Noble but then like I had to like go through crowds and crowds of
296480	300840	people it was crazy why did you go on Harry Potter night because I was there I
300840	304120	went to two Barnes and Nobles for Harry Potter night we went to eat at dos
304120	308600	coyotes was like right next door to Barnes and Noble so we just decided to
308600	312280	go there I was like I want to get the stardust book right now I was there too
312280	318640	waiting with my wife for the book and I was playing Final Fantasy well that
318640	324120	makes you a nerd too I waited in the Harry Potter line last year and I
324120	330040	already bought my British one online and I ended up the still wasn't as bad as
330040	336320	the Dreamcast line in 99 the Dreamcast line I sat and read books I just walked
336320	342520	into games or EB games when James came out so did I I just was like we did the
342520	346040	midnight thing at a GameStop I don't think Wichita is big enough for that
346040	350120	looking in chat room uninvited says we handed out cupcakes for our book release
350120	356880	at Walmart and this old smelly lady came up and ate like 12 one per person unless
356880	360680	you ordered 12 books or had a little sign or something but that just kind of
360680	364080	reminded me of the time the we came out and we were handing out you know the
364080	369880	soda and the doughnuts and smelly people it was some were smelly but not at the
369880	376400	target we ended up staying it was they were all well well-bathed it's too cold to be smelly cuz
376400	380440	when it's cold you can't really smell people as badly as when it's hot like
380440	386880	anime conventions I think that fanboy funk is worse in the summer if you let
386880	391240	it sit out for a little while all right boy funk does not take summer vacation
391240	394720	all right let's let's talk about video games we're like more than five minutes
394720	397760	in the show we haven't talked about video games just been that I said Final
397760	406600	Fantasy video games are video games too but they're not good cuz why is why
406600	409640	isn't there a good Harry Potter game cuz they're made by you haven't made me
409640	413000	design one that's not mean that it's a bad it should be a bad game if it's made
413000	416840	by you know it's the fact that they take franchises and and don't care about them
416840	420320	they're just like oh give me money on them yeah here was now here was the
420320	423800	nerdiest thing ever though we were at claim jumper last night or whatever and
423800	427880	we were going around the table going like what what house would you be in if
427880	432680	you were in Harry Potter probably in sparkly poo there is no sparkly poo you
432680	437880	have to read the fanfiction whatever anyway so we thought why isn't Harry
437880	440640	Potter like an MMO why isn't there an MMO set in the Harry Potter universe
440640	445200	millions of people would play it if they could be you could have like actual like
445200	449000	Quidditch and doing quests in the Harry Potter universe why isn't there actually
449000	454160	a game on ps2 is fun to exactly whatever it was I don't think the universe would
454160	460440	be that big I mean it'd be Hogwarts and well I guess you could you could have a
460440	464200	bunch of other school there are other schools so well now there's not gonna be
464200	467520	any more books why not have you know why not have an MMO in the Harry Potter
467520	473040	universe hmm who says it's not coming I mean look at Lord of the Rings online I
473040	479040	did the quiz that was on the Warner Brothers site and I got Slytherin I
479040	482200	didn't think I did the quiz I got Ravenclaw I was like what the fuck's a
482200	490520	Ravenclaw even smarter because they're also sneaky all right let's get to
490520	493360	actual like video game chat I will start with how was your gaming week dark
493360	499240	soccer how is your games what games I've been high on Vicodin all week so I
499240	503080	haven't played anything not even pinball I did well no I played World Cup soccer
503080	509080	see there's something but I am Ally so I can't really do much gaming all right
509080	513360	well that's all right Loki how was your gaming week I played paper Mario on the
513360	518800	virtual console not exactly like super paper Mario a little bit disappointing
518800	525440	but I don't know it's tolerable for right now I guess I think if I played
525440	529240	that right after I played Super Mario RPG I would have been greatly
529240	535280	disappointed then I played Final Fantasy I'm actually most the way through the
535280	543000	game now what else did I do gaming related I fully disassembled a PSP and
543000	548080	put it back together again because I was thinking I let me put this way I have
548080	553080	charge cables for my PSP but they're at work and I want to play Final Fantasy my
553080	556960	battery was low so I was going to make my own charge cable but then I couldn't
556960	561440	find this my car adapter cable that was going to hack apart for the second half
561440	565840	of it so I was like well I could just solder some stuff on to the USB port on
565840	570320	to the PSP and just solder that to the power port and then it should be able to
570320	574480	charge via USB so I took that all apart and got fascinated with that I'm like
574480	577840	crap this is not going to go back together again is it so I put it back
577840	581000	together and I think it's working now except for some reason though when I put
581000	586240	the USB charge cable I bought today on it it wasn't lighting up so I don't know
586240	589080	if that's just the battery that's in there that's so dead they won't charge
589080	595640	with that or what but hopefully it works otherwise that's my you know parts PSP
595640	601040	anyway so I gotta sell it so I can get a new one then other than that I tried
601040	607840	playing oh I played Super Rub-a-dub on ps3 crap is that one of those new
607840	610360	downloadable games the one with the Ducks or whatever yes it's the one the
610360	614400	Ducks it's actually a game rap yeah it's it's stupid what do you do in the game
614400	618280	you tilt using the six axis because that's almost every single game that's
618280	624680	downloadable on the PSP right now or ps3 you tilt the six axis to make the Ducks
624680	629840	go around you collect ducks and get to the drain it is crap is so fucking hard
629840	634680	to control it's not fun luckily I didn't download the full game I download the
634680	639720	demo so no money lost is it the Ducks from the old first PlayStation demo they
639720	644040	had from every single demo that they've done so far ducks have been all of them
644040	649120	she's running gag and now it's a game no the game still running gag it's crap
649120	655640	that's what it is gk 128 in our chat room agrees with you super rub-a-dub for
655640	663200	the lose he also gk 128 says the controlling super rub-a-dub is so bad it
663200	666840	doesn't even follow your movements right it doesn't and it's just way too
666840	670840	sensitive so no thanks I ended up selling a lot or I sold back
670840	675160	Motorstorm today you know now I'm just stuck with resistance which is you know
675160	679720	great game but I just you know my PlayStation 3 right now is being treated
679720	683560	like my PSP except my PSP has more gaming going along with it because I
683560	689640	don't buy games anymore for it if only they had that for the oh I thought I'm
689640	692920	thinking about modding my weight that might be something that's coming on mod
692920	697960	chips I can play some import games at times all right me go Todd you want to
697960	701280	share with us your gaming week if anything I've still been trying to think
701280	706600	if I played anything this week besides Wow and I don't think I did so I played
706600	712240	Wow what happened in Wow well it made me sad because I decided to level up my
712240	717680	tailoring and there's this one piece of cloth I can only make every three days
717680	722080	in 22 hours so I'm waiting for that time limit to be up I'm just being
722080	727840	disgruntled the whole time while I wait and that's it all right aren't you
727840	732080	exciting I am what's up it's something in the air and not a lot of game playing
732080	739240	this week well I do that at work so I guess that's true I could see that I got
739240	744800	a game what'd you get I got Marvel to moon Alliance for Xbox 360 but I didn't
744800	750560	get the gold one cuz Dan was being a cheap but and he said that I could just
750560	754280	download Hawkeye cuz it's really a character I care about okay so instead
754280	756800	downloading the uber thing that had everybody you can just get the one
756800	762000	character you want yeah I haven't played it yet also play Call of Duty 3
762000	766160	multiplayer for a little bit and there's one cool kill they had we were playing
766160	770600	on eater dam and I was driving the Jeep across it and about to jump the little
770600	775240	gap in the middle and then someone shot me in the head luckily for me I fell out
775240	780400	of the Jeep of course I was dead but my Jeep went forward and went over the
780400	784640	jump and ran them over so it was a double kill is hilarious and then of
784640	787160	course grant up that advice series stories still playing that's still
787160	792160	yelling at everybody nerd my gaming week I tried some of the new downloads that
792160	796960	are available on Xbox live marketplace like Bomberman live but I only really
796960	799880	played the demo for Bomberman about download full game so I don't really
799880	804280	want to give a full review but it definitely already right off the bat was
804280	808240	way better than act zero that's for sure even just the demo the free demo is
808240	812240	better than the $60 act zero so I was pleased with that it's like 20 bucks now
812240	816680	still $20 too much that's still $20 too much for that game but it's cool you
816680	820280	know it's it's it's classic Bomberman so if you remember Bomberman from Super
820280	824380	Nintendo days I did notice though that when you do buy the regular version of
824380	827120	it you're gonna be able to customize the game to hell like you know you just
827120	831560	customize like any type of environment you want to play in and different types
831560	834800	of power-ups that are available and all that it's highly customizable so
834800	840080	definitely a great tournament game I'm also played the ER kung-fu although I
840080	843400	didn't buy the full version because I can play the full version on my computer
843400	847200	because I have it through you know game to happen what have you I just checked
847200	850160	out I did like I thought the new graphics are pretty cool but otherwise
850160	855640	it's not really a game I'm very fond of from back in the day I mean like snow
855640	859840	those ones that's like stood up against the test of time yeah you know I've I've
859840	864720	I've I've defended time pilot and even Russian attack to an extent on this show
864720	868520	but I just can't find my love for ER kung-fu not when there's other fighting
868520	871600	games you know like Street Fighter 2 that are better and especially this HD
871600	875160	remix on the way and so that I'm sure gonna be pretty awesome they need to put
875160	881920	the grid on Xbox live pretty rad and the Rob Dean chat says a ER kung-fu is awful
881920	887000	JV Mon says it sucks ass back in the day back in the day I preferred it to kung-fu
887000	892080	master yeah I way perverted to kung-fu master but just now I just I can't you
892080	895960	know like sometimes I try to I find my retro game love for the simple games but
895960	899800	like ER kung-fu is not one of those games I can just find my love for again
899800	904040	because I guess I never really have there's some of these games on live that
904040	908400	they seem to forget about like you know oh yeah there's downloadable content
908400	913480	coming later and it never does like boom boom rocket I thought there's more songs
913480	916480	it's funny you should mention that because that's another game I got really
916480	919480	into this week randomly like I haven't played boom boom rocket in months and
919480	923840	then this week I was looking at my the high scores and I noticed that I'd
923840	927360	fallen not just to second place within my own friends list but third place
927360	931440	though my own friends list I'm like at one point I had a score in the top 100
931440	934600	okay so I was like alright I got to play this some more and try to improve my
934600	938160	score so I did and I'm back up to second place now within my friends and now I
938160	943160	gotta try and get back up to first place so I'm working on it playing some more
943160	946840	songs but yeah there's no downloadable stuff for boom and rocket at all it's
946840	950400	kind of sad because I'm not a big fan of the tracks that come with the game I
950400	953720	even went to GameStop today I was like I got to get me in another game because I
953720	960400	had I had like Forza 2, Shadowrun and like Tenchu Z and Monster Madness
960400	965280	Bell for suburbia all brand new copies that I got from work but it's like I
965280	968200	don't want to play any of this even Forza 2 I was like well I could maybe
968200	972120	design some cars or something like no that's no I'm not gonna get suckered
972120	976000	into playing this just like I did Project Gotham Racing 3 although Project
976000	979040	Gotham Racing 4 that looks pretty good too but I'm gonna get suckered in buying
979040	983440	that and hate it and then return it back either way to get one of those game
983440	987480	rental accounts doesn't matter I'm gonna get it probably you know Microsoft games
987480	991680	they usually get for free all right JV Mon and Chad agrees with me by the way
991680	995460	that the tracks that come with the game are pretty boring so you go that one I
995460	999800	like is really good I don't know smooth operetta yes smooth operetta yeah that's
999800	1003200	a great surprise Konami hasn't done like well I guess they wouldn't want to do
1003200	1007280	that because of what a downloadable DDR something yeah because they would
1007280	1010840	compete with their own game so why can't they do a downloadable beat mania or
1010840	1013400	something even though you know I know there's a special controller comes with
1013400	1016720	it and all but you know why not do like a button friendly version I don't know I
1016720	1021300	guess I'm being stupid the other game I got really into randomly this week was
1021300	1024720	Carcassonne I finally went back and played the demo more fully for that and
1024720	1028520	I downloaded I ended up spending the cash to get the full game of Carcassonne
1028520	1032000	because I got more into it into it than I did Settlers of Catan but I'll tell
1032000	1036400	you this I suck at Carcassonne I am so horrible at that game like it took me
1036400	1041620	forever to get the strategy down to that game I finally beat the computer in a
1041620	1046120	match but I'm like in last place I've gone from boom boom rocket a game where
1046120	1050080	I'm second place amongst all my friends to Carcassonne where I'm in last place
1050080	1053160	amongst all my friends because I'm just not that good at it I'm still trying to
1053160	1057640	figure out the strategy to it but I'm having fun like I like the fact that
1057640	1060760	it's like a board game but it kind of has its own like you know the you
1060760	1066080	basically the way Carcassonne is is that you're building a puzzle every time and
1066080	1071800	that puzzle involves cities and roads and monasteries and all this stuff and
1071800	1076680	you draw out these cards in a random order and play them down and so you know
1076680	1079920	roads have to connect to other roads cities have to connect to other cities
1079920	1084400	and when you claim roads or claim cities and finish them you get a lot of points
1084400	1088440	for them so it's kind of cool like I've got to play it on Xbox Live and I'm
1088440	1091080	afraid to cuz I know I'll get my ass handed to me but I guess that's the only
1091080	1094880	way you're gonna get better at a game like that so but I've been having fun
1094880	1100720	playing it so yay Carcassonne that's it for my gaming week so we will move from
1100720	1105400	our gaming weeks to some housekeeping first off we want to thank or
1105400	1110640	congratulate I should say one of our longtime listeners DDR angel I don't
1110640	1114680	know if you remember DDR angel I should hope not at all I should hope so she was
1114680	1117480	here for the longest time she got married today so I'm gonna say
1117480	1122400	congratulations congratulations miss DDR angel and her husband who by the way
1122400	1129600	goes online I believe by big red pimp now she's DDR pimp lady yes now she's
1129600	1137880	DDR pimp so congratulations to DDR miss DDR pimp also no show next week we're
1137880	1141000	not gonna be doing any show next week there may be a best-ever something that
1141000	1143800	shows up on the archives that there's time but unfortunately just due to
1143800	1149080	other obligations there will be no show on July 29th so we're very sorry about
1149080	1155000	that dark soccer is going to Disneyland again but I am and I'm gonna be high as
1155000	1158600	a kite there too and usually we would just go ahead and do a show if one of us
1158600	1162560	is gone but also we're moving this is the very last show you're gonna hear
1162560	1167120	from studio number three which we've had you know a good couple of years here
1167120	1170560	we've been here for about two years in this tiny little room but the show
1170560	1174960	basically if you haven't caught on takes place in my spare bedroom and my
1174960	1179360	apartment and in a couple weeks it will take place in the spare bedroom or maybe
1179360	1183680	garage haven't figured it out yet at my new house so I'm very excited about that
1183680	1188680	kind of moving on up so we will be in the new studio soon that'll be studio
1188680	1192760	number four so yes the show has been a lot of places over the past five years
1192760	1200680	so we're excited about that so kind of like a whore what do you mean a little
1200680	1205400	bit well to use it to use a friend of mine's analogy we're like the house
1205400	1215000	broom everyone's had a ride I get it all right well here's the thing also we're
1215000	1220720	looking to kind of relaunch of sorts in a couple weeks like not like we're gonna
1220720	1225440	totally redo the show but maybe try some new things like some new album art some
1225440	1229000	new openings some new incidental sounds and stuff that play throughout the show
1229000	1235000	so if you are a artistic or audio editing type please shoot us an email
1235000	1240840	because we'd be interested in what you can do for us in regards to it new
1240840	1245880	intros and new artwork and all that good stuff so more to come in two weeks when
1245880	1250520	we return with more orange lounge radio for now though let's get to the gaming
1250520	1255800	news for this week and I believe Loki's gonna start us off tonight yes so this
1255800	1260000	week there is a bunch of news coming out of Japan during their PlayStation
1260000	1265600	premiere event in Tokyo and some interesting things coming out mostly
1265600	1270720	stuff that we're not going to see over here one of which is a TV tuner for the
1270720	1277040	PSP it's actually a one seg tuner device and kind of attaches to the top of via
1277040	1284000	the USB port much like the GPS receiver and camera and apparently you can tune
1284000	1287840	into different TV stations and one that's supposed to be coming out in
1287840	1292240	September and that's kind of cool wish it we'd get something like that over
1292240	1300720	here me something third-party I know why is it that we're not getting any stuff
1300720	1304400	over here yes never came out over here either and I don't think the camera did
1304400	1310480	either so maybe we're just not into all those things over here we I know we care
1310480	1313880	about high-tech gadgets over here but not like Japan does that's why we get
1313880	1318200	two colors of things sometimes three Japan gets a hundred and fifty eight
1318200	1323600	versions a week but TVs are kind of cool I don't know I might make the PSP a
1323600	1326480	little more lucrative it depends how much it costs how much does it cost in
1326480	1338080	Japan I was 6,900 yen that's about what $69 right I'm not mistaken yeah all
1338080	1344200	right oh by the way it's only compatible with the new PSP not the old one not
1344200	1346800	that it really matters because in September it's gonna be replacing all
1346800	1351560	the old ones anyways gee Sony likes to do that replace old stuff oh yeah like
1351560	1356280	they're the only company out there that redesigns their systems Nintendo I'm
1356280	1361960	looking at you all right but they make them better and in better colors speaking
1361960	1366920	of better colors there are more PSP color variations coming out in Japan you
1366920	1369520	know how we're getting what we're getting like three colors here two
1369520	1374000	colors in a in the Star Wars okay well over there they're getting piano black
1374000	1379600	ceramic white and ice silver but they're also getting the bloom series with rose
1379600	1386760	pink lavender purple and Felicia blue I want that blue one so bad but this
1386760	1392120	sounds like bubble bath salts colors it's so pretty this sounds like
1392120	1398600	something a housewife would pour in her bathtub and say Calgon take me away PS
1398600	1404000	Sony take me away have salt and bubbles because it would not make bubbles well
1404000	1408160	whatever but still it sounds like baths I'm getting bath salts and bubble baths
1408160	1413240	mixed up okay so that's six variants on the new PSP and they already had like at
1413240	1417720	least four of the regular PSP and so I can't help but feel we're really getting
1417720	1422080	shafted when Sony is doing better over here than they are in Japan well it is
1422080	1428840	launching in Japan on September 29th 19,800 yen and any of those colors that
1428840	1433200	you want there's also some new accessories coming out AV cable super
1433200	1437920	video cable D cable component cable now that's pretty awesome there's a
1437920	1441440	component cable coming out for the video out not just there is that's pretty rad
1441440	1447160	they'll do 480p god now I want one just for the video out so I can play Silent
1447160	1452000	Hill but not it was Silent Hill origins I can play the Akumajo Dracula
1452000	1457440	compilation game that's coming out what what nothing whatever all that I can
1457440	1460840	play all that crap on the TV I'm very excited playing that game for a long
1460840	1466240	time already but it's sexy sexy remake but the original is better whatever it's
1466240	1471200	pretty shush original has Maria's crappy singing in it well maybe one of her
1471200	1477320	weapons is a song book and she kills things by going wow I think I almost
1477320	1480920	died a little right that's exactly what her voice sounds like to you well
1480920	1492360	anyway anyway um I'm sorry I'm all giggly today no um there is a little bit
1492360	1496200	of good news for our friends in Europe the PSP will actually be out there it
1496200	1500880	beginning of September and in Japan it will be there on September 20th so you
1500880	1505000	guys get it first you can just go rub it in everybody's face so Europe actually
1505000	1509360	gets something first for once they got stuff first before remember a few games
1509360	1513080	well nami loves Europe for some reason they get a lot of the cool stuff this
1513080	1516560	has nothing to do with konami no but it's Europe does get stuff first
1516560	1521720	sometimes what's that wow but the the price is gonna be the same as the
1521720	1530480	current ones it's a 129.99 what colors are they getting it does not say oh also
1530480	1535360	and not much of a surprise since we're getting the stupid Star Wars PSP over
1535360	1540000	here that Japan would get something a little bit cooler in the special Final
1540000	1545600	Fantasy 7 system set which will be coming out bundled with crisis core and
1545600	1553160	has some fancy Final Fantasy 7 crisis core artwork on it also it's gonna be a
1553160	1561440	limited production there are only making 77,777 units you know why that is right
1561440	1566160	because it's Final Fantasy 7 and it's not because 7 is the most powerful magic
1566160	1572240	number is beside that actually there was in Final Fantasy 7 if you got I've only
1572240	1575800	heard of this happening if you got your hit points all to seven then you did
1575800	1584240	some special attack for in the game the special attack was called go outside and
1584240	1589040	buy more sequels of this game when it comes out I'm gonna find it so I'm
1589040	1592480	looking I'm just looking at chat room now and going back to some old comments
1592480	1597480	here the Rob D says I want to see Maria and Kirby in a sing-off and the dark
1597480	1604920	no cuz no dark Tatsuya wants to add jigglypuff to that no Maria sings worse
1604920	1610140	than all of them let's see and chainsaw juggling said I did that once it was
1610140	1615160	awesome in reference to the lucky sevens there see I knew it was in there
1615160	1619880	drunami says seven seven seven HP send your character into a constant attack
1619880	1627320	mode yeah it's awesome all right well even though they are getting that super
1627320	1634040	cool Final Fantasy 7 slim thing PSP in Japan everybody is hopefully getting
1634040	1639120	this it's an expansion to Metal Gear Solid portable ops course a lot of folks
1639120	1642840	are big fans of this game on the PSP because it wasn't Metal Gear acid and it
1642840	1645960	was actually more like the other Metal Gear games a lot of folks are really
1645960	1651160	into this your acid though had the cool 3d thing I cool is relative and that
1651160	1655800	cooler headache inducing I know if I wear that thing too long I would
1655800	1658440	definitely have to take some Vicodin for the headaches I'm gonna be getting after
1658440	1663480	using that too much so there you go now IGN is actually reporting from the
1663480	1668080	PlayStation premiere event in Tokyo that this new portable ops game is going to
1668080	1672160	have some online play and that's going to be kind of its focus there's going to
1672160	1677600	be some new characters possibly an older version of snake and there's only going
1677600	1681080	to be a little bit more as far as the single-player mode goes the infinity
1681080	1684040	mission otherwise it's the good old-fashioned Metal Gear Solid
1684040	1688520	portable ops that you're used to they do have old snake from Metal Gear Solid 4 in
1688520	1693040	there he's in the trailer awesome September 20th is the day that comes out
1693040	1697080	hmm I seem to remember something else is coming out that day in Japan as well
1697080	1700680	there it is probably take a little bit longer for it to come out here though
1700680	1705000	because you know Konami hates you and they did some little thing in the yes
1705000	1709240	and they did something in the video where it's like Power Rangers for the
1709240	1715080	trailer that makes me want to play it now dang it well other stuff for anyone
1715080	1721040	who cares is that there is actually going to be a Metal Gear Solid online
1721040	1727680	for ps3 they had a little demo of it out when they did the Metal Gear Solid 4
1727680	1732760	thing so if anybody cares there you go you can all wander around with boxes
1732760	1738600	over your heads I get you know and your truck can start to move could Metal
1738600	1744800	Gear Solid ever be like a first-person shooter someday it was when do you
1744800	1750080	remember the VR missions they came out with a first-person version of metal in
1750080	1754680	Japan it did came out with the first person version of Metal Gear Solid it
1754680	1758040	just kind of makes me think like with all this like online and all that stuff
1758040	1762720	could this be like a new halo I don't know for a certain audience I don't know
1762720	1767960	it's a little silly I would say it's more like Splinter Cell or you know
1767960	1772600	recon some but I don't know I think I'd play it a lot if it was I know Metal
1772600	1775360	Gear Solid is one of those series but I don't get into the Tom Clancy games as
1775360	1778800	much I don't get into them I don't get into that stuff either like the old-ass
1778800	1782960	Metal Gear I used to love house does I don't I don't get into those games as
1782960	1788440	much although the solid I it would be kind of cool to implement that into our
1788440	1792600	website the what the solid I for the you know
1792600	1796880	Melger acid to that that freaking headache inducing thing the thing though
1796880	1803400	but it makes it 3d so I'd be kinda neat a little silly it would be jvmon says
1803400	1808160	first-person shooters suck though that's an opinion that's an opinion some of
1808160	1812240	them are fun some of them do suck but some are fun I love hexen I love like
1812240	1816680	quake 3 that game was badass and Duke Nukem 3d hello why do you think so many
1816680	1818920	people are crazy about doing them forever
1818920	1824120	blaze says correction halo sucks Gears of War is amazing see I don't know I
1824120	1828240	think I could not get into Gears of War at all so I could not get into it
1828240	1836320	I try crazy fun I tried so hard anyways so of course last week you know there's
1836320	1841160	a whole debacle about you know the 68 system being phased out in the 88 system
1841160	1842480	coming into place
1842480	1847640	well there's some interesting commentary about the whole thing coming from Sony
1847640	1852000	Computer Entertainment Europe's president David Reeves in fact he's
1852000	1856760	actually been on record saying you know the difference between 60 and 80
1856760	1861960	gigabytes is very small we're just we just feel like going up 20 gigabytes is
1861960	1866200	not worth it you're gonna double it then it's worth it so basically you know
1866200	1869520	obviously he's commenting on the fact that I don't think the 80 system is
1869520	1871800	coming to Europe I think they're going to be doing something a little bit
1871800	1876640	larger but at the same time you see oh by the way yeah you probably don't need
1876640	1880760	to buy it for another extra 20 why doesn't he just admit we don't have 20
1880760	1885600	gigs worth of shit for you to put on here there really is not that much stuff
1885600	1890520	to download that's what I don't get I you know if I would think it now I don't
1890520	1894040	know I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner and I haven't been reading up very well but
1894040	1897880	does the PlayStation 3 allow you to play movies like from your computer yeah it
1897880	1901880	does anything like any type of movie it's limited but you can play stuff from
1901880	1905200	your computer you copy them to the PlayStation 3 drive or anything you can't
1905200	1908640	download them from your networking copy him but you can download some on there
1908640	1914200	like I have a rip copy of kung pao on my hard drive that can play off there but
1914200	1918960	nothing officially endorsed by Sony I don't think there's any movies that you
1918960	1924100	can download from Sony like let's say on my xbox 360 I can watch wmv files of a
1924100	1928400	certain type over the network and watch them on my TV right yeah but on the Sony
1928400	1931600	I can do that with certain other types of movies yeah why doesn't Sony just
1931600	1935320	blow the door wide open on that and just leave it unlimited to what you get like
1935320	1939080	put all the different codex in there to what you can watch and people would like
1939080	1943120	love that and they could copy movies to their drive and everything I don't know
1943120	1947720	my guy absurd I never understood why they bumped it up from 60 80 anyways
1947720	1953400	because I guess unless you know a lot of games really install themselves onto the
1953400	1957120	drive like I remember Ridge Racer did that and the oblivion I know does that
1957120	1961640	but I haven't really I don't have that many PlayStation 3 games so I can't say
1961640	1965000	if they all do that but if they did all do that then yeah that would fill up
1965000	1969480	pretty quick but at the same time as far as downloadable content that's available
1969480	1974880	on their PlayStation Store there's hardly anything on there I mean I check
1974880	1980000	maybe once every few months and there may be one or two things more on there
1980000	1985200	they're actually worth downloading Ravens Dolphin says what Sony is telling
1985200	1990920	the truth for once and the Rob D says MPAA sky but the MPAA you know what they
1990920	1994400	can't control what if I have a video I shoot on my digital camera that I want
1994400	1999760	to watch over on the TV you know they can't control that F the MPAA you know
1999760	2003080	those comments coming from our chat room chat dot orange lounge radio.com
2003080	2006680	something else maybe that could be a downloadable title I don't know the
2006680	2010920	early screenshots I'm seeing that this game look very simplistic it's from the
2010920	2017040	creator of Katamari Dimashii Kata Takahashi you might remember he said he
2017040	2019800	was taking a break to work on playgrounds remember that like he was
2019800	2023500	supposedly ended konmari Dimashii to go make playgrounds well I don't know if he
2023500	2027940	finished or what's going on but he is released information about a new game
2027940	2035440	for the PlayStation 3 no B no B boy now no B means stretch in Japanese so in the
2035440	2039760	early screenshots definitely look like this big stretching I don't know turdie
2039760	2044380	caterpillar thing stretching around so there's very little information on this
2044380	2048700	is right now but we do know that the creator of Katamari Dimashii is making a
2048700	2052880	new game for the PlayStation 3 that's about it so that's kind of interesting
2052880	2057640	because you know a lot of folks on PlayStation 3 were really sad because
2057640	2061040	there has been no news about beautiful Katamari coming out to their system in
2061040	2065320	fact now it looks like that whole project may have been scrapped so maybe
2065320	2068920	they'll get this new project instead which could be somewhat redemption for
2068920	2072560	them I don't know kind of interesting I think they're beyond redemption they
2072560	2078800	deserve to burn no thinking speaking of things that deserve to burn is a Gran
2078800	2083680	Turismo prologue is going to be available for Japanese PlayStation
2083680	2092520	Network in October we don't get it yet it will have online multiplayer and has
2092520	2098200	an undetermined price it is not free great you get to pay for a demo that's
2098200	2105240	awesome I just say it's more freaking cars so whatever project Gotham is more
2105240	2109680	fun why don't you release an actual game instead of all these demos that's what I
2109680	2115440	think another game that's coming out to PlayStation 3 at least was announced a
2115440	2121280	Disgaea 3 looks very similar to all the other Disgaea games and sadly enough the
2121280	2125040	graphics also look similar to the other Disgaea games meaning that they're not
2125040	2130680	that great but hey it's Disgaea it's another game hurrah yeah Disgaea was
2130680	2134680	never really about the graphics though it was a hilarious voice acting in the
2134680	2138920	stories and you know the game itself it was pretty awesome strategy it looks
2138920	2144560	okay I mean I don't know I would think though that if they're gonna step up to
2144560	2148080	PlayStation 3 they're gonna do something with the graphics make them uber sharp
2148080	2152080	or you know it does look a little sharper but then again the screenshots
2152080	2159680	so small I don't really know well there you go also coming for the PlayStation
2159680	2169760	3 at some point someday Tekken 6 Tekken 6 is going to be coming up I'm sorry oh
2169760	2175800	Tekken 6 is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and of course you know
2175800	2179440	Virtua Fighter is going to have online on the Xbox 360 so it just makes sense
2179440	2183600	that Virtua Fighter sucks PlayStation should have something going for it and
2183600	2189920	that's going to be Tekken 6 Namco Bandai answered at PlayStation Premiere in
2189920	2195600	Tokyo that they will have the online capability you know I don't think that
2195600	2199520	these should really be announcements anymore I think it should always be an
2199520	2204120	online game I mean this is what we Microsoft doesn't go out there and out
2204120	2209480	hey this game is gonna be online most of the games are online it's not something
2209480	2215360	that you really need to announce just get with it Sony or hell get with it
2215360	2218680	Namco I mean you should yeah because when everything online it's not Sony's
2218680	2223600	fault there was this big to-do about Soul Calibur finally going online too
2223600	2226160	and everybody's just kind of like yeah the last one really should have been
2226160	2234800	online right so I don't know that's like saying you know you know Tekken 6 is
2234800	2241920	gonna be in high definition okay great I thought it was supposed to be since it's
2241920	2248840	on you know the PlayStation 3 all right well whatever whatever it is you're into
2248840	2254840	we know that Dark Sakura is into this it's her website of the week and every
2254840	2257920	week Dark Sakura surfs the internet up and down and back and forth and finds a
2257920	2261560	website suitable of sharing with all of you it's called Dark Sakura's website of
2261560	2271160	the week and here it is my website of the week because I couldn't concentrate
2271160	2274440	long enough to actually pick a real site so I picked a version of the site I
2274440	2283760	picked before and it's ROFL cats calm it's more lol cats so there you go more
2283760	2291600	Caturday first to spread the badly grammar spelling cat captioning fun

2308280	2318880	judge jury and executioner she's looking folks the justice system or fucking

2334080	2339360	two pictures of cats of you say which one's cuter it's adorable okay one more
2339360	2344400	oh now that's funny that's why I see it's a picture of Winnie the Pooh and
2344400	2351560	you're saying take up please yeah that's funny all right your psych is that
2351560	2355960	acceptable I will allow this site is Rob pleased with my offering I have it
2355960	2361840	ceiling cat is very pleased with your offering next story please I don't get
2361840	2366080	that crap anyways it's not surprising we talked a little bit about this last week
2366080	2372120	there was a survey that went out to all the attendees of e3 this year kind of
2372120	2375360	asking them their opinions on certain things that they're possibly going to
2375360	2380520	change for next year of the following they were offering new locations
2380520	2388680	including Santa Monica San Diego Laguna Beach San Francisco or LA also they were
2388680	2393040	prefer our question was do you prefer to see the summit held in multiple hotel
2393040	2397920	settings like it was this year or a convention center type larger facility
2397920	2403560	setting I know I'll probably speak for Bobby insane larger facility convention
2403560	2410200	center type setting instead of having to drive between hotels and says also
2410200	2414120	they're talking about what month you like you know options included May
2414120	2420120	through August and then of course if you didn't visit Barker hangar or the
2420120	2425320	Fairmount Hotel why not I hope it comes to because I was stuck in traffic I
2425320	2429840	wasn't invited he'll get a link to the survey so we can fill out I wasn't
2429840	2436640	invited I didn't visit it because it's eight hours away too far although I did
2436640	2441560	not find it interesting that you one of the choices was San Francisco and you've
2441560	2444320	been begging and pleading for it to come to San Francisco's that way cuz you're
2444320	2449480	lazy and you don't have to you know flyer anything you could just drive
2449480	2456520	driver to LA for a convention I will I swear I'll only fly to LA ever again
2456520	2463400	because I hate that drive so horrible I drive great on that drive is the most
2463400	2468880	boring drive is pretty boring you probably take the five yeah five is
2468880	2473000	pretty boring but 99 is not much better 99 has great truck stops on the way and
2473000	2476760	you meet all kinds of colorful people it's like five is like field field field
2476760	2483400	field mountain field field field smell and cow like by what was it that Marissa
2483400	2489160	called it a cow shwits cow shwits the town of Kohling a beautiful stuff
2489160	2496000	anyway the Rob D is saying they've never driven in Illinois have they hostile
2496000	2500600	on her miss here the people in Illinois don't know how to drive at all son of
2500600	2506880	dad says e-308 in Vegas for the win I would not mind e-308 in Vegas I don't
2506880	2513760	think Vegas would work oh why not but it's Vegas well they just did was it the
2513760	2522480	ESA thing there or EMA camera what is the video kind of their big convention
2522480	2529880	in Vegas and it sucks in Vegas everything's way expensive and act deaf
2529880	2537080	says e3 in Mexicali Mexico hell yeah e3 in Mexico let's have it in Tijuana that
2537080	2543920	would rock I'm gonna go to Mexico this year for what world pump finals they
2543920	2547360	moved it out of Korea this year and they're putting it in Mexico so I'm
2547360	2552200	gonna have to you know bring soap and something to keep the dirtiness away and
2552200	2556360	a water filter horrible and a water you guys are horrible I'm sure those
2556360	2564760	stereotypes are not true it's always gamer day at Easter Island it's so
2564760	2569440	fitting mmm blaze says e3 in Canada so Rob can get more maple cookies I like
2569440	2573840	that idea e3 in Canada requires leaving nothing
2573840	2578920	against Canada but they're not gonna have anything up there ever they have
2578920	2584520	red PlayStations I live Canada I wouldn't to Brad I will take California
2584520	2590800	drivers over Alabama drivers any day all right Florida drivers may I move on may
2590800	2595240	I do a new story no no one thing you might remember we were all giddy about
2595240	2599080	on this program about a year ago was the Silent Hill movie remember Silent Hill
2599080	2603040	came out we were all excited because his pyramid had like right there it's not
2603040	2607840	four times you know he cut the shit out of people and rip that lady's skin off
2607840	2612160	it was awesome and so of course we were excited about a Silent Hill 2 coming out
2612160	2616600	but now I don't know how excited this is gonna make people about Silent Hill 2
2616600	2621560	because Christoph Ganz has said I'm sorry I don't have the time to do Silent
2621560	2627640	Hill 2 so he's not gonna be doing this is good news to you yes why cuz I didn't
2627640	2630800	think he did a great job with the first one that's all right you know what you
2630800	2636240	know who's wrapping up filming on Far Cry ooh a bowl yeah god I hope he's
2636240	2641320	available somebody just needs to shoot that man in the head yeah careful what
2641320	2644960	you have to understand in Silent Hill now will be setting will be setting the
2644960	2650760	jungle on an island so be a rave there someone needs to strap that man down and
2650760	2656200	lobotomize the section of his brain that controls writing movies oh wait they
2656200	2660240	already did that explains his last few movies well anyway since Christoph Ganz
2660240	2665000	is not on the next film Roger Avery took a hike as well now see what's going on
2665000	2671240	is that Ganz has said to a French magazine DVD Rama that the sequel was
2671240	2674720	ordered by Sony but he's kind of too busy with other movies like Onimusha
2674720	2679480	which he's adapting that game as well obviously um so he can't do it he said
2679480	2683320	this quote if I cannot take on Silent Hill 2 myself the director who does
2683320	2686900	would need to continue in the same style as the first film and then make you
2686900	2691520	excited Jane one does not want that crappy did get the style right one does
2691520	2695360	not want to make a Hollywood style movie and I think that it makes sense if the
2695360	2701840	director of the sequel is European in the best case scenario French so there
2701840	2707000	it is and Roger Avery said if I'm not gonna do Silent Hill 2 if Christoph's
2707000	2710960	not gonna do it that's fine we don't need them they just go the way of the
2710960	2714720	Resident Evil movies I know Resident Evil is bad because they don't really
2714720	2719880	follow well anything it's kind of gone on its own tangent but it'd be cool like
2719880	2723680	if Silent Hill kind of took over the world and then you have people trying to
2723680	2727960	survive all these mutated evil things not everybody enjoyed the Silent Hill
2727960	2731000	movie though I know a lot of people did and I liked it those well then they can
2731000	2735760	just make a sequel from me exactly they should have me write it it's just it
2735760	2741000	just stars pyramid head seriously they should have me where I will write it's
2741000	2745080	pyramid head gone wild honestly they just need to look at the second game and
2745080	2749360	then take the dialogue and then add some scenes where the action takes place and
2749360	2752360	there you got you got your second movie but what I don't want it to turn into is
2752360	2755700	I don't want Silent Hill Silent Hill series to turn into like the Halloween
2755700	2759860	series where it's just like pyramid head kills everything you know a pyramid head
2759860	2764540	at summer camp killing lovely young ladies now if they wanted to spin off
2764540	2770600	series I'm all fine with that Freddy versus Jason versus pyramid head oh you
2770600	2775740	know they both die cuz pyramid heads awesome I'll be awesome because nobody
2775740	2779860	can kill a pyramid head he has to end up offing himself
2779860	2784960	son of dad says a Luca Besson Silent Hill would own wasn't he the guy that
2784960	2791120	did the fifth element I'd be pretty hot that would be hot hmm maybe maybe we
2791120	2798060	shall see Bruce Willis as pyramid head no Bruce Willis versus pyramid head that
2798060	2804120	would be fun cuz then no John McLean versus pyramid head cuz nobody would
2804120	2809280	die hard fun they just take out the whole fucking world between them okay so
2809280	2815080	so I guess what else keep speaking of you know weird bizarreness that episode
2815080	2818600	is South Park where they did the World of Warcraft thing which I finally saw
2818600	2828440	two days ago is up for an Emmy glad she's on top of it I don't watch TV I
2828440	2834080	have to either be really bored or high on Vicodin to watch TV and I was high
2834080	2838480	as a kite on okay for to explain to people who are listening I broke two
2838480	2842520	ribs so I'm currently medicated so that's why I sound like a goofball
2842520	2849080	tonight and I was bored enough tonight hey shut up and I was I was so bored
2849080	2853400	that I decided to watch the South Park episode of World of Warcraft what the
2853400	2856560	other way around you know what I mean did live up to your expectations it was
2856560	2860400	kind of funny but there was stuff that was wrong but I did think it was your
2860400	2866800	son's character is going to die I was like oh shit bathroom bathroom I know
2866800	2872480	people who get like that is so stupid so I thought it was funny but so does it
2872480	2880960	deserve an Emmy no what's the Emmy for I don't know this is nominated for one
2880960	2887360	it's just got nominated for one who cares the poop award for animated
2887360	2896160	defecation awesome well there's gonna be some good stuff coming out this week

3031080	3037080	systems on the Wii Dewey's adventure makes its debut over in Japan which is
3037080	3041940	not a good game it's no really I don't like it one bit why don't you like it I
3041940	3045880	just don't like the controls at all I think it's a cute game and it's
3045880	3051720	definitely Ella bits ish but it's it's not fun to set the Wii's problem or is
3051720	3054880	that the game's problem because I noticed a lot of it's not the Wii's
3054880	3059680	problem I mean this could have been done with a 6-axis too I just don't think the
3059680	3064640	last time I played it the controls were tight enough also coming out in Japan
3064640	3072220	Mario Party 8 guilty gear double X accent core and some jigsaw puzzle games

3086320	3093160	games I even have the PC Engine one coming out on the PlayStation 3 Major
3093160	3098840	League Baseball 2k7 Mina no golf 5 and one gun midnight is coming out on
3098840	3102840	the PlayStation 3 shit I want to practically import that game I was
3102840	3106320	awesome I love the arcade series screenshots for that and I thought that
3106320	3110520	was kind of interesting it looks like it's the first game though I don't know
3110520	3114240	how would you practically import it like just get the instruction book well cuz
3114240	3120800	PlayStation 3 is free order with all sorts of practicality like if I'm gonna
3120800	3124000	rationalize getting a PlayStation 3 that's one of the games that would
3124000	3126960	actually make me want to do it because I love that I don't know if it's region
3126960	3132320	free for the games though that's the only thing god damn it I'm not sure well
3132320	3137000	hold well this I thought it was region free for games not from the site says no
3137000	3141120	region protection well then awesome I'm gonna have to import that fuck yeah oh
3141120	3148120	yeah well me too well fuck yeah twice uh-huh anyway I don't want to fuck yeah
3148120	3154000	twice PlayStation 2 is getting a lot of stuff going into best hits but they're
3154000	3160080	getting some new games as well I believe this is new ikki tosen shining dragon is
3160080	3165480	coming out and then also the metal gear 20th anniversary collection metal gear
3165480	3168400	solid 2 Metal Gear Solid 3 and another your solid collection is all coming out
3168400	3172520	PlayStation our Phantasy Star Universe takes a price cut as it moves into the
3172520	3178800	best series and sanyo pachinko paradise 14 oh also another another game goes
3178800	3185560	into Sega ages this would be volume 30 galaxy force 2 in Japan you big fan of
3185560	3193280	galaxy force no I don't know Nintendo DS is getting a lot of games as well this
3193280	3197720	is a big release week for games over there a Taiko no Tatujin on the DS is
3197720	3203280	coming out over there and also this is great another Hello Kitty game this one
3203280	3210360	is called Hello Kitty no I shot a party Sanrio characters Zuka and DS isn't that
3210360	3213720	a mouthful it's an action game but it has all your favorite Hello Kitty
3213720	3219000	characters I see twin star I see kiropi but I don't see bats Maru so this game
3219000	3225600	fails let's see if there's anything on the PSP real quick alexa silvara and the
3225600	3229720	charm says Wangen midnight equals maximum tune to now not necessarily the
3229720	3233240	box art doesn't say its maximum tune to it just calls it when again mid get
3233240	3236640	midnight it's all-encompassing I don't know if it's all-encompassing or what it
3236640	3241280	is I would be the ideal I would think on the PlayStation 3 also look at more
3241280	3244320	information on this game with that up during the oh you looking that up right
3244320	3248960	now well I was looking at it is region free so it's not that expensive either
3248960	3253000	which is good I'm just like I don't know if it's all in Japanese or something
3253000	3257600	because some of those games can actually be in English as well I just I don't
3257600	3262240	have any careful well on the Sony PSP you finally get Grand Theft Auto Liberty
3262240	3265600	City Stories in Japan Capcom is bringing that to you I always think that's
3265600	3269240	interesting how that works intercontinental there how different
3269240	3272720	companies can bring the games see because the other game that I would like
3272720	3280160	to get also maybe would be folks all you know like folklore that's gonna be
3280160	3284760	coming over here well that's all I got for Japanese releases maybe I can get
3284760	3289440	well I have some European releases but only a few we have guilty your dust
3289440	3294800	strikers on DS guilty your judgment on PSP and they're finally getting the
3294800	3302920	pokey man's diamond and pearl which was also a print album I'm done wow I was
3302920	3309320	quick there's other games listed with with uh to be announced titles but you
3309320	3313800	know there's nothing really specific which I would assume that some of these
3313800	3319480	would already be out I would hope like Saints Row is listed for ps3 okay here's

3478680	3482280	time theater please all right in fact we give emails we're gonna get to the mail
3482280	3486200	bag very shortly here and I read the avalanche of emails that came into our
3486200	3491960	mailbox this week at mail bag at orange everybody but first this was a big story
3491960	3496680	here Peter Moore has left Microsoft that's right Peter Moore has been
3496680	3500600	become very well known lately it's kind of like the face of Microsoft and a lot
3500600	3504360	of these events and of course Peter Moore came to Microsoft from Sega which
3504360	3508440	drew all these comparisons about the Xbox 360 launch versus the Dreamcast
3508440	3513120	launch and so on well Peter Moore is actually left to move back to the Bay
3513120	3517160	Area so welcome back Peter Moore even though we're not technically in the Bay
3517160	3521120	Area we're close enough Peter Moore has come back to the Bay Area to be with his
3521120	3527240	family so what he's gonna do now he's going to head up EA Sports is what his
3527240	3532280	new role is going to be so even though he's gone from working for a giant you
3532280	3535220	know console maker to a publisher that's still nothing to blink at that's still a
3535220	3539840	very important role EA makes crap loads of money and if you're wondering who is
3539840	3544720	going to replace Peter Moore well it's going to be Don Matrick who comes from
3544720	3552160	EA he's coming from EA there you go and will be interesting to see if this has
3552160	3557600	any type of changes on Microsoft's PR but probably not probably not really
3557600	3563680	gonna be the same old stuff see a son of dad says Peter Moore quit to go work at
3563680	3568240	showbiz you know it's funny you know where Reggie Fils-Aime came from you
3568240	3571600	know one of the places he worked before he was at Nintendo Pizza Time Theatre
3571600	3578680	no Panda Express really yeah but I mean look at you know Panda Express is nasty
3578680	3582760	but it's everywhere now it's insanely popular so I don't know if that was his
3582760	3587520	doing or what but there you go no it was the doing it was people addicted to MSG
3587520	3593080	maybe all right anyhow I'll see we mentioned the mailbags coming up so
3593080	3596680	let's get into the mailbag dark soccer likes to read your emails that you send
3596680	3600600	this every week well dark soccer is forced at gunpoint to read your emails

3670360	3674000	am NOT going to Blizzcon none of us are going to Blizzcon but you know what you
3674000	3679280	know who is going to Blizzcon blizzard yes blizzard is going to Blizzcon so say
3679280	3683720	hi to them no so actually olr will have some representation at Blizzcon you're
3683720	3688400	gonna love this this is hilarious extra fur is going to Blizzcon he got he got a
3688400	3693080	ticket to Blizzcon for his birthday from his sister and her fiance who both also
3693080	3698320	play Wow in our guild so look for extra fur I actually want to send him with the
3698320	3701440	tape recorder a microphone to do some interviews at Blizzcon because I think
3701440	3705640	it would be hilarious sure so that's gonna be your olr representation at
3705640	3708640	Blizzcon right there but unfortunately because of the move and everything it's
3708640	3714160	it's too close to the finances for me probably doesn't help also that all the
3714160	3717040	tickets sold out within like a few hours that didn't help either and I was out of
3717040	3720920	town when they went on sale otherwise I might have bought one oh well so they
3720920	3723920	had interesting to see me go to Blizzcon because I have no interest in World of
3723920	3728720	Warcraft drunami says if we hang out with Wow radio we should say hi to total
3728720	3731720	biscuit I don't know who that is but I'm sure somebody listening does so there
3731720	3739680	total biscuit can I read the next you may okay hey olr crew it's me necky sorry I
3739680	3743280	haven't emailed in a while but I've been really busy been loving the show
3743280	3747640	recently by the way warning this might be really long no I've got longer sorry
3747640	3753600	you don't quite meet the the longest email category I've seen longer I've seen
3753600	3760120	plenty longer I've seen thicker can I read please yes you perverted people
3760120	3765440	what I was talking about emails shut up boo-hoo my 360 died earlier this week
3765440	3769800	and although it's a pain in the ass Microsoft is very good at cleaning this
3769800	3774880	up I had to I had to phone twice second because I forgot my original mobile no
3774880	3780280	but I was only on hold for a best ten minutes each call so things should go to
3780280	3783960	Microsoft for their good support the extended warranty shows that they are
3783960	3788200	taking responsibility for it so I am understanding however dot dot dot dot
3788200	3792880	dot dot the expected time I will get my Burke 360 back is over one month also
3792880	3797320	did Microsoft say they have fixed the problem with the new Xbox 360s if so I
3797320	3803720	intended to shell out for a new 360 instead the good point to my 360 dying
3803720	3809440	is that I finally have dug out my old ps2 some of the games seem unusually
3809440	3814280	unusual now and look bad graphics another thing is that the PlayStation
3814280	3818160	controller seemed tiny if using the Xbox 360 controllers alone for five to six
3818160	3823160	months dude you want to see tiny try playing with a dual analog controller
3823160	3828760	for the Saturn and everything will look tiny to you trust me also a note on an
3828760	3833240	email last week I fully support younger online players who are online I am now
3833240	3838960	15 I can truthfully say that I am definitely more mature than than other
3838960	3843760	even 30 year old players who use the n-word and anyway I'm not going to let
3843760	3847160	this go on really long so by necky PS this is good
3847160	3851240	gramming speller lol's I'm not well I could point them out but I'm not going
3851240	3855840	to because I'm not I'm too doped up to be a bitch tonight and PBS look for me
3855840	3860320	in the chat room I saw you there I was gonna say something hi necky you're so
3860320	3866140	lying you didn't look I did no I even voiced him all right and necky is one of
3866140	3869520	our listeners from the UK so to be in our chat room right now dude your
3869520	3874320	parents know you're up oh there was a question there but the Xbox 360 and and
3874320	3879100	having three well have they fixed the problem on Xbox 360 I believe they have
3879100	3882460	didn't they change the chips that were on in the Xbox 360 as part of to change
3882460	3889060	that problem Loki am I wrong they didn't change chips they changed the heatsinks
3889060	3894240	that were on the graphics chips and stuff and all the new ones um have been
3894240	3898880	are being fixed I guess so then the new system shouldn't have this problem
3898880	3903000	theoretically unless there's something else that goes wrong all right well
3903000	3909280	we'll see what happens so that's it for email yes right right email the Rob D
3909280	3912680	and chat confirms they changed the heatsinks so heat distribution is
3912680	3916760	different there you go I have an email you have an email yeah I got it right
