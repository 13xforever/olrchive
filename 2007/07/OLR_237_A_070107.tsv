14261	24555	Tonight, July 1st, 2007, Soul Calibur IV goes online, the world of Civilization comes to consoles, and are achievements about to get product placements?
32409	37150	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37190	42052	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42492	43412	My name is Rob Roberts.
43432	44593	You might know me as Sky.
45033	48174	Not joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48354	49254	She has the night off.
49474	55616	As many of you long-time listeners of the show may know, she's been very active in taking up massage therapy.
55916	57937	She has a little bit of a conflict with her schooling tonight.
57997	59137	But the show must go on.
59477	61358	And joining me as always, say hello to Loki.
62045	62385	Hello.
62925	63546	How you doing, Loki?
63966	64666	I'm doing okay.
64706	66387	I just scoffed down a sandwich.
66707	69429	Yeah, you had like a large Quiznos.
69469	70609	It wasn't like a regular size.
70669	70969	Was it?
71149	72170	Yeah, it was a regular size.
72510	77653	It was a balancing act with the sandwich, and also it is spicy, so it's like, you know.
78933	79594	Spicy sandwich.
79634	81995	Regular size Black Angus steak sandwich.
82295	83095	All right, there you have it.
83355	83756	Yum, yum.
84216	87457	But not that we endorse any particular commercial products here on this program.
88118	88498	No, no.
89022	89582	DarkSakura.com
115017	115718	Good, thanks.
116058	116338	I don't know.
116358	122082	If you want to tell Rice Princess how you're doing, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
122102	125505	We do tape live here on Sunday nights at orangeloungeradio.com.
126025	129188	And Rice Princess will just be helping us get a third perspective tonight.
130048	130629	Yeah, pretty much.
130709	134852	But also the chat room is there as always to give us a million more perspectives.
135092	135673	Yes, you're right.
135693	137534	As if we actually had a million people in the chat room.
138174	139355	That would be the best thing ever.
139375	141276	Well, not in the chat room.
141316	142857	Four or five different opinions in the chat.
143017	143297	Yeah.
143798	144338	Over and over.
146977	153859	All right, anyhow, let's start off tonight's show with a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week, where we talk about what we've been playing this week.
154559	156540	Loki, I guess you're going to start us off tonight.
156740	156980	Okay.
157860	160421	Well, this week I've been playing some interesting things.
160901	166703	Some have actually, you know, people have been questioning why I'm playing them, like the Transformers game, for one.
167323	168264	I was playing that on 360.
170638	176581	It's okay, it's kind of like, I like the game like, um, I like Driver 3.
177662	185526	It's a poorly put together game, and it has some blatant flaws in it, but it's, it's okay, it's just I play it.
185546	186987	Like what, the same type of graphical stuff?
187007	190309	Okay, let me put it, put some examples in place here.
190509	199914	Um, when I first started the game, immediately there was a big pileup of cars in the street because they couldn't figure out how to turn the corner correctly.
200544	201885	So, that was kind of funny.
202186	208651	The other thing is, if you throw anything at anything in the game, you know, pretty much like, you can throw a road cone at a building.
208731	214956	Well, what happens is, when you hit something with said road cone, shrapnel comes off the building.
215397	221582	Well, that shrapnel hits another building, and then more shrapnel comes off that building, and sometimes it goes back to the original building.
222003	227087	So, you can literally destroy an entire block by just throwing a road cone at something.
227797	230240	And so that's kind of fascinating at the same time.
231141	235246	First comment of the night, DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, Loki, testers not doing their job?
236087	236788	Of course not.
236988	238650	It was definitely a rushed game.
239290	246358	Is it that testers aren't doing their job, or is it that testing gets their corners cut because the game has a strict deadline of trying to be out in time for the movie?
246379	247560	I think it's probably corners cut.
247680	248341	That's what I figured.
249093	252254	But other stuff that's kind of crappy in the game.
252374	257476	Oh, the very first boss that I fought in the Autobots campaign killed himself.
260737	261597	Suicide man.
261697	267179	We were fighting in this, like, I don't even know what it's supposed to be, like a power plant or something like that.
267579	274462	And they have all these explosive, like, I guess, I don't know, propane tanks or something all around.
274602	277663	And unfortunately, you set off one, the whole place goes up.
277763	277943	So...
279001	280042	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
295442	302246	A lot of our chatters are big fans of Transformers, looking forward to the movie, and I understand you actually got to see a little sneak peek of the movie.
302266	304687	Yes, I got to see the movie last Wednesday.
304747	304987	Awesome.
305007	305407	How was it?
305447	306027	They're dying to know.
306047	307988	It was fucking awesome.
308068	308228	Why?
308268	308969	What was awesome about it?
308989	314271	It was awesome because the action in the movie is just non-stop throughout the thing.
315031	322695	It's very similar to Independence Day, how it jumps back and forth between different character story arcs and stuff like that.
323960	333065	So you've got that, plus, you know, in the beginning of the movie, when, like, Scorponok comes out and stuff, fucking spears a guy through the chest and pulls him into the ground.
333125	335127	Right there, I was like, fuck yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
335187	336727	So, you know, any spoilers?
337788	339769	Um, there is a couple spoilers I was gonna mention.
339869	341450	These are kind of cameos towards the end of the movie.
341470	345993	Remember that rumor going around that there was gonna be an Xbox 360 robot in the movie?
346013	346373	Uh-huh.
346673	353037	There is, briefly, a cameo, because, um, the AllSpark, whatever, causes things to come alive.
353057	353137	Yeah.
353497	368523	and so one of the things that happens to get set off by this is a 360, so you see this guy carrying it out of, I don't know if it was a GameStop or something, but, you know, it busts out the side, just for, you know, half a second, then there's a Mountain Dew Machine robot, which is funny, shooting cans at people, so...
369604	372907	It's a brief little cameos there, but it was an excellent movie.
373047	374988	Highly recommend it if you like action movies.
375028	379711	If you're looking for a deep storyline or something like that, you're not going to find it here, but it was good.
379932	388898	Okay, unfortunately we're radio and not television, so you can't really see everything that goes on here in studio, but Rice Princess is making her patented Laura Roslin face.
389518	394383	and the Laura Roslyn face is, if you've ever watched Battlestar Galactica, you know, what's the actress's name?
394423	395584	Mary McDonald, is that it?
395744	396545	I think that's what it is, yeah.
396565	406995	Okay, like, you know, the actress, she has this, whenever something negative happens, she has this very distinct look where she kind of scrunches up her nose and her mouth and, like, Irene or Rice Princess has that look down pat.
407275	409838	So when she's displeased with something, it's the Laura Roslyn look.
409878	412520	So why are you giving this review the Laura Roslyn look?
412960	414362	Okay, the Xbox...
414878	415198	and DarkSakura.
444148	445309	Come on, Microsoft.
445429	446590	They don't even show the 360.
446990	451073	All they show is the white premium box and an arm punch out the side.
451193	452654	You know, and that's it, and the guy drops it.
452674	455456	And it's there for literally one to two seconds.
455576	456517	I would drop it, too.
456737	460480	I caught it, you know, real briefly, but a lot of people probably won't even notice it.
460560	462441	It does not detract from the film whatsoever.
462741	465423	It's not like, let's call Xbox 360 robot.
465463	466644	He will defeat everybody.
466704	469086	I mean, it's not anything like that at all, so...
469566	475568	He will charge you 800 Microsoft points for every projectile that he throws.
476888	478469	It's a good movie.
478669	479189	I liked it.
479289	480529	I cannot wait to see it again.
480909	485831	I keep forgetting that Rice Princess is really anti-Xbox and Microsoft.
486111	487051	Remind me again real quick.
487131	492113	I'm not super anti-Xbox and Microsoft.
492173	492653	I'm not.
492993	496514	I don't even know much about Microsoft to really hate them.
496594	496874	I just
497526	498826	Don't prefer them.
499747	501167	They're very underwhelming to me.
501207	503588	Didn't you tell me it has to do really with the games that they offer, though?
503608	505328	That's what I'm saying.
505689	508469	I'm very underwhelmed because they don't have anything to offer to me.
508570	510790	Nothing appeals to me on that system.
512251	516252	You need to see the Eternal Sonata demo, though, if you haven't yet, because that seems like a Japanese RPG.
516292	520453	I have actually seen it, and it does look really pretty, and I would totally play it.
520833	522294	Maybe Blue Dragon in the future?
523354	525316	She made the Rosalind face like a second.
525336	526296	You're getting so good at that.
526817	527177	I know.
527257	529018	I've been practicing for a long time.
529558	531019	But, yeah, I don't know.
531139	533040	Blue Dragon might be cool.
533721	534001	I don't know.
534181	534521	We'll see.
535082	537083	But definitely the other one looked really good.
538904	539184	All right.
539264	540445	Anyhow, let's see.
540805	543246	Ross Steel UT seems to agree with you in chat room.
543387	545608	Xbox 360 is all first-person shooter.
546048	547509	It's not all first-person shooter.
547529	552172	He also says, listen to Loki blindly defend a shitty unrelated marketing ploy.
553318	558023	It is a blatant, but the whole movie has blatant, you know, product placement everywhere.
558043	561947	I mean, come on, a fucking Mountain Dew robot, you know.
562268	563589	Enough movie chat, game chat.
563609	565171	Sorry to interrupt your gaming week, but anyways.
565191	565471	What else?
565691	575762	So, other than that, actually, when Nellie, I bought Nellie the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix for the Wii, which I might add that has the worst cameras ever.
576528	578970	Ever in a game is so awful.
579090	580652	But, you know, she likes it.
580852	581733	It's, you know, Harry Potter.
581753	583134	I think she actually finished it.
583794	585156	I forgot that was out.
585516	587618	Do you really like cast spells with the Wiimote and everything?
587778	588278	Heck yeah.
588619	589159	It's okay.
589539	591941	It's just the whole game, I mean, it sounds fun.
591961	595104	You get to cast spells and stuff, but the whole game is doing tasks for people.
595484	599288	It's like running around this stupid place and doing, you know, meaningless tasks.
599408	601590	Like, I've lost my stuff.
601630	603471	People have hidden it somewhere in Hogwarts.
603491	604132	Go find it.
604665	622360	Well, thank you for giving me no hints whatsoever, and Hogwarts isn't exactly small, so, you know, it takes a lot of time, and there's also a lot of things where if you forget what you're supposed to be doing, you go back and ask them, they won't give you any hints to what you're supposed to do or something like that, and a lot of the puzzles are hard to figure out what they want you to do.
623661	624541	What a bunch of fuckers.
624702	624902	So...
626099	640586	The combat in the game, using the wand and stuff, is pretty stupid, because Nellie didn't really have a grasp on any sort of strategy, so she's just swinging the wand around, or the remote, I guess, around like crazy, and it won every battle.
640907	642767	So, you know, whatever.
643208	646930	But it's cool if you love Harry Potter, you'll definitely like the game.
647630	651052	But I would recommend, though, probably don't get it on the Wii, maybe get it on the 360.
652510	653511	or the PlayStation 3.
654011	656952	So the Wiimote waving for your spells is not all that.
657112	657652	It's not all that.
657952	672938	It's just, I think, I'm not sure if the second, if in the normal, like the 360 and the PlayStation 3, if you use the other analog stick as, you know, maybe a camera look or something, but I know in the Wii version, it was hard to even face in the right direction for, you know, certain things.
672958	676840	Like, you'd be facing at what you want to cast a spell at, pull out your wand and you'd turn around.
677340	679141	It's just like, you know, it's like, come on.
679621	680581	You know, what the hell?
680661	681942	But it looks cool.
683060	690409	The other games I've been playing on the PSP, actually Wipeout Pulse, which is not out over here in the US yet, but it's okay.
690449	691250	It's just like Wipeout.
691270	695536	I've played a lot of Wipeout Pure before, and it's very similar to that.
695556	697959	It looks actually almost like a PlayStation 2 game.
699699	701860	Pretty awesome, so that's going to be coming out in September.
702541	707944	The other game I've been playing is Final Fantasy, the remake on the PSP, and that's actually really awesome looking.
708124	712247	You showed that to me, and I played it for about 15 seconds, and I'm so fucking sold on it.
712267	714188	The game is freaking gorgeous.
714708	716730	The screenshots don't do it justice.
716790	718371	The game looks so beautiful.
718431	719051	It's amazing.
719751	720492	It's just amazing.
720652	723274	We're actually going to get married, me and the game.
723534	724835	You and Final Fantasy are going to get married?
724875	725795	We totally are.
725875	726956	We've already discussed this.
728056	732578	The last game I was playing was a game called Zainide Revolution, I think.
733299	740843	And it's a sequel to an Xbox shooter game, like one of the shoot-em-ups that came out probably very late in the Xbox lifecycle.
741723	743424	And it's kind of different.
743444	745485	This one now is a 3D shooter.
745525	748126	You're kind of going towards the screen, I guess.
748947	749067	And...
750174	763140	It's still, you know, got the shoot-em-up aspect stuff in the game, but it's, you know, after seeing, you know, games that are free, like No Gravity and stuff, I'm sorry that, you know, the background of the whole game is just a full motion video and you can see artifacts and stuff.
763200	770344	It's just not very good when, you know, a free game like No Gravity does everything in real time and it looks amazing for no money.
771244	773865	So, I, you know, I'd probably hold off on buying that, but...
775728	776349	It's pretty cool, though.
776369	779153	Definitely get Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II when those come out.
779753	780354	Awesome games.
780835	782077	Alright.
782137	782697	I'll go next.
782778	785141	Actually, Rice Princess, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
786563	788065	Okay.
788726	792551	You know, my quite substantial gaming week that consists of
792987	795189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
821643	822604	Why are you on this show?
823024	823524	I don't really know.
824264	825325	To cuss a lot.
825405	826085	I don't know.
826225	829226	But we're going to be creating a twink guild.
830067	831167	What's a twink guild?
831367	833468	I know we've had this discussion on a previous show.
833508	836029	I'm not going to go to the porno-related side of this.
836109	836950	Just tell us straight up.
836990	838010	What is this guild all about?
838571	840131	The guild's all about PvP.
840171	842512	We're going to be doing Morsangulch and Narathi Basin.
843173	848635	And we're going to stay at level 29 because it's like, you know, so we can do AB and it's like the first one we can do it at.
849502	849923	and Twinks.
850184	851126	Everyone knows what Twinks are.
851186	858464	They're just the really like super awesome like characters that have all the best gear and all the best enchants and all that stuff and
858971	859391	BattleStarGalactica
887231	887953	It's Lee Adama.
887973	888595	Lee Adama?
889016	890078	Oh, you nerd!
890118	891501	Lee Adama's mine.
891622	892023	Shut up.
892263	892824	You shut up.
892885	896613	Mine's going to be Tyrell because he's hot and sexy and nobody likes him except for me.
897409	898890	So I'm like, whatever, I'll take his name.
899530	901791	Who else do we have in our PvP guild?
902751	903111	A lot.
903391	903591	Really?
903611	904972	I'm pretty sure there's a Roslyn.
905612	907733	I don't know if there is a Roslyn.
907753	913595	Well, one of our guilds said they wanted to be a real bitch, so we said do Admiral Kane.
913835	916396	Yeah, oh my god, isn't that the best thing ever?
916876	917136	Anyway.
917316	917897	She's my hero.
918357	921398	So that's pretty much it on my end of the gaming week.
923218	924439	All right, let's see.
927259	933446	Ross Steel, UTSM Advice, Rice Princess, you might have time to game if you didn't upset over that useless time sink.
935353	937314	In other words, stop playing WoW and get out of the games.
938115	938675	Oh, man.
938975	939756	That was hilarious.
940136	941977	Because you're never going to get away from WoW, huh?
942377	942977	Not really, no.
942997	944158	She's giving you a Rosalind face.
944938	945339	Let's see.
945359	948160	My gaming week actually, sadly, was pretty similar.
948180	953183	I didn't play a whole lot outside of WoW, but I have a good reason because I was out of town for three days.
953243	953884	I was in L.A.
953924	963389	and kind of – I had to do this thing for work where we were kind of – we stayed all together for this team-building thing away from the society, so I couldn't even get out to an arcade or a bar or anything, so –
963729	964550	Thank you for watching!
981423	1000343	I've been playing Survivor, like the TV show, I've been playing Survivor on LiveJournal Imagine like, you know, because a lot of people play Dungeons & Dragons online So there's Survivor on LiveJournal, so I'm playing that And I wasn't the first voted out, thank God So, there you go So, I was very happy about that
1001428	1002209	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1029275	1038678	Yeah, you know, I was kind of having, I was dishing out PSP Uncertainty because, like, there wasn't really, again, it was kind of like the Xbox.
1039059	1046381	There was nothing that was really appealing to me except for Luminous, you know, but now I'm seeing all these games and I'm totally going to invest in one.
1048322	1049943	Yep, thought I'd interject that.
1050863	1051143	All right.
1051420	1052941	Alright, well, let's see.
1053181	1060506	Now that we've gone through our gaming weeks, perhaps we should get into some housekeeping tonight and tell you guys about what's going on with us.
1061146	1066930	We are going to be making an appearance at SAC for Sacramento Anime.
1067430	1072854	We're going to be going to that convention, which is, I believe, two weeks off.
1073114	1075535	I think we're going to be making an appearance on Saturday the 14th.
1077385	1088935	and for those of you that are in the Sacramento area it's at that hotel that's across Martin Fair Mall all the details we will have next week we're still trying to work that out with the folks and I need to make sure even all of us are available or else it's only going to be some of us however
1089907	1094611	We will not be taping one of our live usual shows at this convention as we did for Fanime.
1094931	1102818	We will be recording a special bonus show that only folks on the LiveJournal, the MySpace, our communities will be able to direct download.
1103118	1104839	It will not go into the RSS feed.
1105159	1114827	So if you are interested in keeping tabs on all that type of special stuff that we put out that's extra, check out our LiveJournal community, which is Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, or you can check out our MySpace.
1114887	1116228	Our username is Orange Lounge Media.
1117189	1118330	Orange Lounge Radio on MySpace.
1118530	1119930	You'd think I'd just learned English this week.
1119950	1120891	What the hell is going on?
1121031	1121691	You did.
1121751	1122451	You did.
1122671	1123112	Jeez.
1123652	1126273	Well, you know, because last week was the five-year anniversary and all.
1126573	1129434	Now this week, we're just set up for disappointment.
1129474	1130515	It's like, who gives a fuck anniversary?
1130555	1131755	How did we top last week?
1131815	1132095	Exactly.
1132115	1133056	Who gives a fuck anymore?
1133076	1134456	I'm surprised we're here.
1134676	1140038	When you're at the top, you've got to have to bring it down a notch and gradually go down a bit so that you can bring it back up.
1140178	1144280	For 250, because 250 is a landmark number, so you have to bring it up again for that.
1144520	1145341	Totally right.
1146161	1146461	Anyway.
1147393	1147834	Happy Canada Day!
1170435	1170975	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1194124	1194785	We're getting a cat.
1194945	1196266	I'm not buying an Apple product, ever.
1196566	1197086	An iPhone?
1197126	1198007	I know.
1198387	1199928	One of our friends got an iPhone.
1199948	1200669	They're pretty sexy.
1200769	1202430	It was bringing sexy back.
1203411	1208955	Just knowing Apple, there'll be something even better next year, so I'm going to hold off, and hopefully I'll have money because I'm moving soon.
1209275	1213078	Actually, also, the countdown is beginning for the last shows in this studio.
1213378	1218182	We're going to be moving to a new room because I'm moving to a new place, and hopefully a bigger studio.
1218662	1218962	I hope so.
1247968	1248909	Oh, you already named it?
1249229	1250891	No, we didn't name it.
1250951	1252773	It's a foster cat right now.
1252833	1258178	It's in a foster home, so we are going to be picking it up on Friday of this next week.
1258218	1263983	Jake Simmons says, name it Kitty Bobo, and RawSteelUT says, name it Tingle.
1265565	1266706	I can't name it Tingle.
1267467	1268648	It responds to Stella.
1268688	1270229	We'll see about nicknames.
1271671	1271951	All right.
1273312	1275194	Also, I wanted to mention this real quickly.
1275935	1280639	You're going to be hearing this a lot, especially those of you guys that listen to a variety of podcasts.
1280999	1288385	You're really going to get sick of hearing this after this month is over, so we're really only going to say this once, but it is that time of year.
1288445	1293069	The podcast awards are open and nominations have started as of today.
1293509	1297513	And of course, we would be tickled pink if we could get nominated again this year for
1297873	1298514	Thanks for watching!
1318309	1321851	All we really want to see is the independent podcasts prevail in this.
1321911	1326854	And last year, even though we weren't nominated, we were very happy to see that five independent podcasts were nominated.
1327114	1328034	And that's why we want to keep it.
1328054	1328795	Because you know what, guys?
1329295	1335679	Those podcasts that are owned by the corporates and the big game companies and the big gaming magazines, they don't need the exposure.
1335959	1336219	They have...
1336983	1339645	Lots of ad dollars that go into their print, their TV.
1339665	1340825	They don't need the exposure.
1341146	1343847	But the independent folks, a podcast award can really help them out.
1343867	1346589	Because when we won it in 05, it really did help us out.
1346629	1349631	So please, you know, make sure an independent wins it, guys.
1350591	1353333	If it can't be us, we definitely would like to see another independent win it.
1353873	1354533	So there you have it.
1354934	1355554	Podcast awards.
1355574	1356935	The nominations are open, I think, through the 15th.
1357791	1358151	Awesome.
1358431	1358712	All right.
1359152	1367536	And I'm hoping that people will suggest independent podcasts from other categories in our thread on the forums to maybe nominate, because I don't know a lot outside of gaming.
1367556	1370517	Like, I know a couple sci-fi and a couple, but not a lot.
1370557	1374039	So I'm hoping that we can kind of share and help promote the indie podcasts.
1374239	1374860	That would be cool.
1374980	1375240	All right.
1375900	1379462	Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's gaming news.
1379702	1383764	Yes, not a huge surprise, especially with E3 around the corner.
1384184	1392348	We're getting a lot of announcements of what's going to be coming out at E3, what you can expect to be reading about, because obviously most of you probably aren't going, including us.
1392918	1393478	Fuck you, people.
1393858	1401142	Anyways, so one of those, which isn't a big surprise, and I'm surprised we haven't seen more of it yet, Killzone 2.
1402002	1413968	Sony's invite for, I believe, their press conference and whatnot was, of course, Killzone-themed, and they're probably going to be featuring the game playable or in some sort of trailer.
1414088	1414989	I'm guessing playable.
1415009	1419231	I mean, it's got to be coming out pretty soon at the event, so...
1420379	1421080	and DarkSakura.com
1438766	1439887	Yeah, whatever.
1439987	1442649	I mean, it'll all be on the internet within five seconds anyway.
1442749	1452595	And, you know, we've seen enough of how the gaming industry works on the inside that what's really going to happen is that the game companies will sell the rights to one of those big box gaming companies.
1452875	1461460	And the big box gaming companies will actually post it the day before E3, meaning that all the independent press who actually manages to get into E3 has to run their stories 48 hours late.
1461480	1462421	That's the way it's really going to work.
1462561	1463702	So, you know what?
1464242	1468164	We're just going to stay at home and steal other people's articles this year because, hey, it's the American way.
1468184	1474248	All I know is when these press conferences will be going on, I will not be doing much work at my desk because that's usually the case.
1475160	1478161	I'm usually just hitting refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh.
1478241	1478701	Oh, news!
1479161	1479441	Read it!
1480082	1485043	Can you watch them live, like last year, or is it because it's not as big a, you know, it's low-key, you can't watch that stuff live?
1485483	1497167	I can, but at the work, you know, a lot of the internet's blocked, so a lot of the, you know, unless they're streaming it straight off their site and not off something else, you know, most likely I can't watch it live.
1497227	1500588	But who cares, you know, if I can read about it, that's all I really care about.
1501876	1502856	I don't think I've told you this.
1502876	1504737	I'll have to tell you a little more, give you details offhand.
1504777	1513219	But one of our other folks that works for Orange Lounge Radio on one of the other weeknight shows actually had some touch with a game company this week.
1513459	1515380	And that game company said they'd invite us to E3.
1515820	1517360	But now it's, like, too late.
1517820	1519401	It's like E3's only ten days away.
1519421	1520561	I'm like, great.
1520741	1524062	Now we got a possible invite, and now it's too freaking late.
1524842	1525502	I know, that sucks.
1525642	1526002	But oh well.
1526122	1526622	Maybe next year.
1526723	1527623	Too bad it's on a weekend.
1527663	1528603	I'd drive my ass down there.
1529529	1530190	Thanks for watching!
1546092	1546472	Big deal.
1546753	1551576	I mean... I sadly can't go to PAX because of a wedding, but I hope somebody from the Orange House Radio staff is able to go up there.
1551956	1553277	E for All I'm definitely going to, though.
1553497	1555559	I'm trying to make it to E for All.
1555879	1561003	I don't know if I'll end up making it out there, but I would like to go, because it'd be nice to see that stuff.
1561463	1563765	Will Rice Princess be going to any of these big gaming conventions?
1564738	1565819	I want to go to BlizzCon.
1566359	1566939	BlizzCon?
1566959	1567360	Yeah.
1568060	1572223	I can't, though, because all the tickets sold out within, what, fucking four days or something like that?
1572243	1573203	Why does that not surprise me?
1573223	1573424	I know.
1573464	1574644	I think about four hours.
1574944	1575565	Four hours?
1575605	1575905	Really?
1575925	1576706	It was pretty quick.
1576726	1577606	Days, hours, doesn't matter.
1578267	1578567	Yeah.
1578867	1581168	I'm really sad about that, but whatever.
1581569	1582169	I'll go next year.
1582449	1586292	GS68 says the SF Bay Area needs a gaming convention, darn it.
1586432	1586732	Damn it.
1587529	1587869	I agree.
1588109	1591371	I agree, except there is a whole Game Developers Conference, which is kind of a big deal.
1591391	1594532	Well, if you remember, though, they did try to do something like that.
1594592	1594872	Did they?
1594892	1597953	Remember there was that one convention that was in San Francisco?
1598754	1600974	It was a weekend, and I don't remember what exactly it was.
1601094	1604596	It was, I want to say, it wasn't like sponsored.
1604676	1606277	It might have been sponsored by GameSpot.
1606297	1608217	It was like a GameSpot Expo or something like that.
1608237	1608938	Tech TV used to be there.
1610438	1612399	Didn't Zip Davis own GameSpot one time?
1612939	1613820	No, that's one up.
1613900	1614860	Hello, no, I'm crazy.
1615535	1617658	Ring Game Pro or something.
1617778	1621784	There was a GameSpot Expo, I want to say, that was in San Francisco.
1621924	1622765	It was really small.
1622785	1625589	They only had maybe 15 publishers out there.
1626130	1630316	But from what I remember reading, there wasn't that much response to it.
1630456	1631237	It was pretty crappy.
1631477	1635658	Besides, we're being totally selfish because obviously the SF Bay Area is pretty much in our backyard.
1635698	1637738	It's about two hours away, so it's totally drivable.
1638018	1640739	But I'm sure everybody's like, I wish they'd have a gaming convention in my part of town.
1641519	1647120	But the good news is, you know, usually there's at least something small-ish in any type of town.
1647520	1651701	I mean, even if it's like an anime slash game convention, which you see a lot of those everywhere.
1651721	1656322	I would rather, you know, go to Gamers Days over, you know, the...
1657006	1658186	Giant E3s any day.
1658206	1660387	I mean, at least you get more one-on-one time with games.
1660607	1661467	I kind of agree.
1662187	1664968	I liked the first Konami Gamers Day that we went to.
1665028	1667748	That was pretty low-key, and we got to play pretty much everything.
1668508	1683091	The last one, though, not so much because of too much press, and the place was kind of smaller, and it seemed like, you know, well, we got to get the shot for our TV show, you know, get out of the way type shit, and everyone's kind of there to do jobs instead of report stuff.
1685051	1690817	Well, anyhow, obviously one big announcement that came out of... Oh, actually, I want to read a chat comment here.
1690877	1692238	GS191 is correcting me here.
1692278	1696342	Well, actually, CNET is actually owned by Ziff Davis, so GameSpot by proxy is.
1697063	1697684	So, interesting.
1697984	1698645	I didn't realize that.
1699245	1700607	Alright, moving on.
1700767	1700867	Oh!
1701773	1703834	Sorry, I keep reading chat and I see new stuff pop up.
1703854	1709415	There was a big convention this weekend that might be a little bit near and dear to our hearts, and the folks have been listening to us from the beginning.
1710135	1722598	Beaumonti Fest was this weekend on the East Coast, which is, of course, this big Beaumonti and Beatmania and DDR convention that's on the East Coast that they have at a bowling alley, hence the term Beaumonti, which is cute.
1722898	1728400	And they actually get, usually, some folks that are actually in the games to come out there and perform, so that's cute.
1729080	1732481	I wish I was at the East Coast a couple weeks later than I was.
1732561	1733261	Maybe I could have gone.
1734041	1735402	Anyhow, big conventions.
1735542	1739523	Last year, one of the big things we saw at E3 was Final Fantasy XIII.
1739863	1741683	And of course, everybody wants to know, when?
1742303	1743844	When will we get this game?
1744304	1751946	Well, Square Enix has actually said that they will be doing no games for the PlayStation 3 until after April 1st of 2008.
1752046	1752286	Why then?
1753806	1755587	because that's the new fiscal year.
1755647	1759669	There will be no games from Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 this fiscal year.
1760269	1763111	Not a big surprise as far as Final Fantasy XIII is regarded.
1763151	1764572	I think most of us here in the U.S.
1764612	1769894	were thinking we'd be lucky to see it at the end of 2008 with all the translation and stuff that has to go on.
1770375	1770955	But there it is.
1771954	1773014	You know, that's really sad, though.
1773195	1783639	I mean, when you think about it, because, you know, Sony really needs some strong titles to come out in order to be able to push this PlayStation 3, you know, to the level that the 360 and the Wii are right now.
1784199	1790482	And people were kind of hoping for Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid 4, and both of those now are, you know, after March of next year.
1790562	1793163	And, oh, missed another Christmas.
1793403	1794424	That's not good.
1794444	1796765	I mean, that's going to really put them behind.
1797505	1798725	I don't think they're going to be able to catch up.
1799066	1799866	I mean, they're going to need...
1800655	1805916	It's gonna have to be one of those, you know, fucking one in a million shots that's gonna...
1807233	1808914	So what's Sony going to push this Christmas?
1809274	1810274	LittleBigPlanet, Home?
1810294	1813676	Well, Home, LittleBigPlanet, I get their first party stuff.
1813716	1814796	Killzone's not going to be out this year.
1814876	1815356	There's no way.
1815376	1816037	Oh, yes, that's true.
1816297	1824700	I mean, you're probably looking at second quarter of next year, but I would say this year probably Heavenly Sword, I mean, because that's pretty much God of War on the PlayStation 3 anyways.
1825760	1829522	Lair is going to be good, and probably some unannounced stuff.
1830102	1832803	Ratchet & Clank, the new Ratchet & Clank, it looks awesome.
1832923	1836765	I mean, same people did Resistance, and that game was sweet, so...
1837569	1837929	I don't know.
1838530	1840112	It's going to be hard for them.
1842034	1845357	Ranma says, we'll see Final Fantasy XIII before Duke Nukem Forever.
1846018	1846398	Very true.
1846718	1847039	Probably.
1847639	1848220	Oh my god.
1848240	1852424	I can't wait for the day when Duke Nukem Forever is actually going to come out.
1853685	1856068	Frisbee calls it Final Fantasy Sporever.
1857389	1857629	Get it?
1857649	1858110	Because spore.
1858718	1862299	It's just been delayed a year or something.
1862319	1865319	These are all games that people cannot freaking wait for.
1865339	1869720	Well, Spore that we've seen playable in some form, and you know what?
1869860	1876441	It's just a very large game, and they have to make sure that it's going to be everything that they want it to be before they release it.
1876641	1877701	It's just like Fable 2.
1878681	1879522	It's just like Fable 2.
1879582	1883582	Fable 2 is probably going to be delayed forever because they want to make sure that it's perfect.
1884142	1884663	And you know what?
1884783	1887363	I'd rather them be perfect than, you know,
1888134	1890795	Have another Transformers game come out, or Spider-Man 3.
1892956	1897737	One thing that's definitely not been perfect is the brand new firmwares for the PSP.
1898398	1905480	Not one firmware so far released has been able to be not hacked, and such is the case with 3.5.
1906060	1914223	In fact, last week they found a new kind of workaround called the Illuminati version,
1915831	1921355	and basically uses the old Luminous to run homebrew code.
1921675	1926898	And of course, immediately after that came out, there is now a 3.5 downgrader.
1926998	1938466	So you can downgrade your PSPs to be able to run either 1.5, so you can run homebrew that way, or to be able to run custom firmers, which, you know, custom firmers are the way to go, I think.
1939927	1944690	Other interesting things, though, because of the Illuminati exploit,
1945332	1948139	The Luminous sales have skyrocketed about 14,000%.
1950064	1954095	So a lot of people are picking up Luminous, which, you know, it's a great game anyways, but...
1955899	1957800	It might be a little hard to find it if you don't have it already.
1958000	1964143	Well, most people were ignoring Luminous 1 because Luminous 2 was out now, and I doubt Q Entertainment's making a lot of those.
1965284	1966844	Who published that one, actually?
1966864	1967865	Was it Q?
1968205	1969706	Or was it Sony actually published it?
1969866	1971787	It was Q, but I think Ubisoft published it.
1971867	1972207	Ah, okay.
1972487	1976169	But Ubisoft has been making a lot of copies of that probably because of Luminous 2.
1976249	1977370	I don't think it's available anymore.
1977390	1979971	I don't think so either, but people are trying to scrounge them up now.
1982198	2007619	Also on Sony platforms, much anticipated, Guitar Hero rocks the 80s And they've done a brilliant job over at Activision of keeping this game in the press every week Before it's released, because they'll give you a few more songs this week A few more songs, a few more songs Well finally we know the whole dang song list Because we've got some more songs this week, and that's it We've got the whole song list Caught in a Mosh by Anthrax is in the game I'm only going to read the songs I care about
2007919	2013541	Police Truck by the Dead Kennedys We Got the Beat by the Go-Go's and I love this one.
2013781	2015621	I think I'm turning Japanese by the Vapors.
2015761	2016101	Awesome.
2017262	2017782	That's great.
2018062	2019302	That's going to be a great guitar song.
2019562	2021083	Why are you making Rosalind face, Rice Princess?
2021263	2022583	Because the song list sucks.
2022843	2023583	You don't like the song list?
2023603	2024344	I don't like it at all.
2024404	2025984	There's some other stuff though that was already announced.
2026004	2026944	I read the whole song list.
2026964	2027724	You read the whole thing?
2027764	2028065	Yeah.
2028705	2029085	I agree.
2029105	2029825	They could have done a little better.
2029845	2030805	What were you hoping for?
2031405	2037087	For like better 80s music that wasn't all just like hair bands and just like
2037776	2038376	Pauly Abdul
2069722	2071603	Ranma says Guitar Hero needs Weird Al.
2072563	2075485	Frisbee says Elite Beat Agents was going to have Weird Al.
2075685	2077746	You know, that was also a song list that turned out to be fake.
2077786	2081528	I don't know if that was ever actually going to be in the band, I think, or in the game.
2081568	2083309	I think somebody just kind of pulled that out of their butt.
2083429	2084990	Money for Nothing would be fucking awesome.
2085710	2086090	I agree.
2086490	2087531	That'd be cool.
2087791	2089692	Drew Nami says give us Bohemian Rhapsody.
2089732	2090993	I think that was 70s, though, wasn't it?
2091013	2091833	Yeah, it'd be too long.
2091853	2091993	79 or 78.
2094884	2095164	All right.
2095264	2097085	Well, there you have it, Guitar Hero 80s Edition.
2097105	2100085	Those of you guys that do like the hair bands, I'm sure you're very excited about that.
2102266	2108627	Anyways, since E3 is right around the corner, not too surprising, we're starting to get leaked lists from E3.
2108687	2111688	This, of course, should be interest to everybody.
2112248	2114729	The Konami E3 list was leaked out.
2115069	2120570	Looks like coming from a tip to Xbox Live Radio or XBL Radio.
2120890	2123591	Who is another affiliate on allgames.com, just like us.
2123971	2124211	Awesome.
2125725	2127526	Some stuff, of course, not too surprising.
2127606	2140474	DDR Supernova 2 for PlayStation 2, Universe 2 for the 360, Karaoke Revolution American Idol 2 for the PlayStation 2, a game called DDR Disney Challenge for the PlayStation 2.
2142495	2144296	Let's see here what else we got.
2144316	2147358	DDR Disney Challenge?
2147378	2149599	Because I thought I read a report somewhere else.
2149619	2149960	I don't know.
2150000	2152241	I was following that said something Disney Channel.
2153755	2155316	It probably is Disney Channel or something.
2155356	2158780	Disney Challenge sounds kind of weird unless it's like all hard stuff.
2159701	2159981	Whatever.
2161482	2164766	There's this weird game called Girl's Secret Diary for the DS.
2165987	2168710	Record your secrets and dreams in your journal.
2168970	2169611	I can't wait.
2170553	2172515	Is that a game that will finally tear you away from WoW?
2172555	2173356	Girl's Secret Diary?
2173416	2174016	Yeah!
2174316	2175037	Oh my god.
2175217	2182263	I don't know why, but that game starts to sound like Ping Pals to me and I get very worried because Ping Pals is shittacious.
2182483	2185906	It should have Girl's Secret Diary RPG or something.
2186166	2191091	I think you're just bitter because it's Girl's Secret Diary and that means you can't use it, Rob.
2192011	2194353	And you're like, oh fine, it just sounds like Ping Pals anyway.
2195995	2196275	Shut up.
2196335	2196735	You shut up.
2197656	2198477	Shut your face up.
2199577	2200880	No, I'm totally not going to get that.
2201601	2203304	But, you know, I'm sure we'll find out more.
2203364	2206109	It's being Avery's, like, what, just over a week away.
2206169	2206791	Come on, folks.
2207429	2217859	Well, it's around the corner that the PlayStation 2 is going to kind of have their year or two of being the budget system, you know, because it's so cheap and most of the games are probably going to fall to $19.99, $29.99.
2218740	2228509	So like a Disney game on PlayStation 2 kind of makes a lot of sense to me because, you know, who's going to have the PlayStation 2 now is the young kids that, you know, mommy and daddy are buying systems for.
2229009	2230891	It's a perfect title for a $29.99 price point.
2233573	2241695	All right, well, even though we might be seeing DDR on the PlayStation 2 soon, the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting another long-time series coming to it.
2241815	2244935	Wipeout Pulse is going to be coming out.
2244995	2250356	Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe has been showing this off for the past few weeks over there in London.
2250877	2262679	Now, Wipeout Pulse is going to be a high-def version of Wipeout, and it's going to be released in 2008, but hopefully we're going to get to see some hints at the game at E3.
2264506	2265407	Whoopity-doo!
2265727	2267109	I mean, okay, it's high def.
2267309	2269932	The whole thing was pretty much cel-shaded anyways.
2269992	2275437	I mean, it's not like that, you know, upping the textures are going to make it any better or anything.
2275638	2276378	But hey, cool.
2276659	2279201	You know, I'm sure they'll use the six axis and all that fun stuff.
2279582	2283626	As long as we get some great raving soundtracks like all the other games, that'll be great.
2284527	2286889	You know, Pulse's soundtrack is actually pretty cool.
2288681	2291042	Now some other interesting stuff coming from the Sony camp.
2291362	2297824	This one though in India, and unfortunately we're not going to see an advertising campaign like this over here, but oh my god, I wish it was.
2298604	2305346	Apparently they have a new advertising campaign that is a little bit chauvinistic, I guess.
2306066	2309367	Let me just really quickly read the entire ad.
2310820	2312120	Sherry is such a bitch.
2312320	2317081	Last night I saw her with this weird guy whom I think she's seen.
2317181	2319042	I mean, she created such a scene.
2319162	2326543	When she broke up with Josie, bloody attention seeker, it's not been a week and she's already sleeping around.
2326863	2327664	And you know what?
2328004	2330364	I think Nicole is two-timing Ron again.
2331664	2337306	And in the very bottom it says, PlayStation 2, because your girlfriend bores you shitless.
2337886	2338426	Ha ha ha!
2340362	2341063	That's funny.
2341123	2342205	Why don't they do that here?
2342305	2343426	That's really funny.
2343487	2346190	People would be pissed off and get offended and stuff.
2346290	2347512	Are you offended as a woman?
2348353	2354041	I'm offended it's not being advertised here because that's like one of the best advertisements ever because it's so true.
2355575	2357897	I don't give a shit While his girlfriend's like So that was kind of funny
2383012	2386093	Ross Steel, UT in chat says, and then we wonder why women don't play video games.
2387053	2391454	Yes, that's the only reason why, because gaming companies make offensive advertisements.
2391494	2397836	Most women I know would see the offensive advertisement and then go, well, if they're going to be like that, then I'm going to play lots of video games.
2397876	2398516	I'll show them.
2399396	2400217	I don't have to be boring.
2400357	2404698	Well, it could be like, you know... Then they'll realize how terrible they are at video games and then they'll stop.
2404738	2408239	PlayStation 2, if your boyfriend can't satisfy you, Rez will.
2408419	2408659	I mean...
2410743	2411624	Oh man, that's so true.
2411644	2413145	There's a great ad campaign as well.
2415307	2418089	I can't wait to see the ad campaigns for Soul Calibur 4.
2418509	2421452	Especially, you know, being that Ivy's... Now with more jubblies!
2421952	2426176	Ivy's slut-tacious boobs are being shown off in the trailer there.
2426196	2427817	There's massive side boob in those pictures.
2427837	2429818	There is massive side boob in those pictures.
2430339	2434482	And a massive bombshell drop this week in regards to Soul Calibur 4.
2434522	2437465	Of course, the game is coming out next year on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2439606	2441447	and, you know, Tekken is online now.
2441547	2445009	So, hello, Namco, is Soul Calibur 4 going to be online?
2445430	2447371	And the answer is yes.
2448131	2450493	And that quote comes from Namco.
2450533	2457237	It says, quote, With the current environment, we really couldn't make Soul Calibur 4 without online play.
2457317	2462500	That's from the director, Katsutoshi Sasaki, who makes Soul Calibur 4.
2464645	2467326	So that's exciting, because I know a lot of folks like to play their online games.
2467726	2469767	Hopefully there is not some crappy lag.
2470287	2470888	That would be bad.
2470908	2474229	Because crappy lag always ruins those online fighting games.
2474629	2485774	But I actually remember reading some other unrelated story this week that talked about a lag-free system for fighting games that have been developed that's supposed to eliminate practically all the lag that you see in fighting games.
2485794	2490996	I don't know how well it works, but maybe Soul Calibur 4 will be able to implement some of this technology.
2491036	2491316	Who knows?
2491556	2492217	I think it's a myth.
2492317	2495259	Kind of like those cars that run on air or something like that.
2496039	2501523	The magical cars that zero emissions and fuel would be plentiful.
2502784	2503345	It's all a myth.
2503865	2504185	Anyways...
2505458	2509141	What's interesting, though, this announcement just came out recently.
2509801	2515806	Apparently, the Bourne conspiracy is going to be coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
2516566	2525893	Now, it is based on the Jason Bourne character from the book series, and not necessarily from the movie series, even though the Bourne... Oh, so Matt Damon?
2526194	2527074	No, Matt Damon.
2527314	2527755	So, um...
2528155	2528735	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2550663	2556044	We're getting some feedback on the last story because sometimes there's a little bit of lag here between chat and what we're taping live.
2556084	2562666	Of course, chat.orangehauntsradio.com Toshin is in chat and says, this is not a myth, the whole lag-free fighting thing we're talking about.
2562686	2563926	He says, my friend made it.
2564486	2566707	FYI, ggpo.net.
2567607	2567987	Interesting.
2569848	2570468	I guess we'll see.
2570548	2571928	Let's see how well it's implemented.
2572748	2578210	I haven't seen any videos of it in action yet or gotten to use it myself, but the prospects of it sound very exciting.
2578430	2578950	Don't get me wrong.
2579963	2584445	Moving on to another title that's having another version coming out.
2584505	2589588	TimeSplitters 4 is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
2590608	2596691	TimeSplitters kind of seems to... It's not a game you hear about a lot, but a lot of folks that have played this game seem to really enjoy it.
2596711	2598152	You're a TimeSplitters fan, aren't you, Loki?
2598652	2599913	I love TimeSplitters.
2599933	2602414	I cannot wait for this.
2603274	2607396	TimeSplitters is probably hands down one of the best first-person shooter games out there.
2607896	2609257	Especially TimeSplitters 2, which is...
2609696	2611938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2633077	2644024	The forum post that originally tipped people off to this also says about the article, there's no actual news on the features other than Steve Ellis says, quote, they're gearing up to insert monkeys and guns into all the wrong places.
2644684	2644944	Awesome.
2646565	2648166	Yeah, that game had lots of monkeys.
2648887	2650108	I'll make Loki very happy.
2652349	2656932	Some other interesting stuff, you know, a lot of people have been, of course, overclocking their PSPs with...
2657725	2659527	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2679643	2690667	The first game that's going to be doing this, though, is God of War Chains of Olympus, and it's going to be running at the full speed on there, because obviously the game's going to be quite graphically intensive.
2692448	2699231	Interesting to see that they're actually finally kind of saying, fuck battery life, we're just going to use the full speed of this system.
2702731	2707993	So why is it that folks don't want to use the full speed of the system normally?
2708013	2709373	I don't understand the way that works.
2709433	2715255	Originally, it's because it cut down on battery life, and so they couldn't advertise that the battery lasts X amount of time.
2715575	2717596	I mean, originally, they could run it at the full speed.
2717616	2723238	In fact, you can overclock yours to run at 333 megahertz instead of 222.
2723578	2728960	In fact, that's what we do for playing Grand Theft Auto, so it's smoother, less load time.
2729380	2731501	But I don't know.
2732003	2734284	It's just their choice, I guess.
2734985	2735545	They don't want to do it.
2736086	2736386	All right.
2736746	2741549	Well, our chat room, of course, we're a little bit behind, apparently, because they're still reacting to the last story.
2742069	2743750	And they're talking about the racing cats.
2743870	2746332	And Actdeft says, we don't want monkeys.
2746432	2747673	We want laser cats.
2749454	2753796	Because remember, we talked about laser cats, the game, and how somebody badly needs to make that.
2755637	2755918	Sorry.
2756218	2756498	Go ahead.
2757418	2761301	I was going to say, and then the chat room says that they actually want rap cats.
2762712	2763132	Kill me now.
2787601	2795648	So, they're going to either have a way to dump games to the memory stick, or you're going to have a new download service where you're going to be able to download games to run straight off the memory stick.
2796148	2805116	Even though they kind of do that with demos right now, but it is an official ISO loader, which apparently is going to be included in the next homebrew firmware that's going to be made.
2805556	2806677	Mmm, the plot thickens.
2807458	2807738	All right.
2808018	2810420	Well, anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.
2810480	2816824	Even though DarkSakura isn't here this week, we're going to sneak behind her back and open up the email bag because we can't wait.
2817144	2818364	We're like kids on Christmas Eve.
2818404	2819785	We can't wait to open up our presents.
2820085	2824868	And when you guys send us emails every week at mailbag at orangeontradio.com, they are like little presents.
2825248	2826129	So let's open up the mailbag.
2831701	2838924	Alright, not a whole lot of emails this week, I think because a lot of folks actually got to call into the show last week and kind of say their piece.
2839404	2841305	However, we do have some emails.
2841365	2842305	I want to start with this.
2842385	2843666	This is from DarkMutz.
2844866	2851849	Hey guys and gal, I have been listening to you for about six months and I found your podcast to be the only one that is consistent and always entertaining.
2851989	2852269	Thank you.
2853169	2861415	I have to thank Loki because without his clever insight about what makes a game fun, I never would have found Earth Defense Force 2017.
2861835	2863616	I have been addicted since I acquired it.
2863956	2865738	Congrats on five years and keep it coming.
2865778	2870301	The three of you keep me going through my work day without having to light anyone on fire.
2870541	2871642	Thanks again, DarkMuds.
2872631	2873191	Very cool.
2873231	2876934	Isn't that a weird feeling when somebody says, like... You know, because video games aren't cheap.
2877314	2883598	So, like, somebody says, like, based on your word, I spent $50 of my hard-earned money for my day job that drives me insane to buy this game.
2883798	2887740	At least it's only a $40 game, so that doesn't, you know... But still!
2887860	2888301	But still.
2888341	2888761	I know, I know.
2889081	2891603	So what makes a game fun for you, Loki?
2891823	2893424	It's just... It's gotta be fun.
2893464	2895405	I mean, you know, we're at the Fence Force.
2895425	2897346	It's one of those games I'm still playing.
2897767	2898307	It's because...
2898820	2899720	TimeSplitters 2 TimeSplitters 3
2924953	2926254	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2954733	2955593	Hey, D3's awesome.
2955873	2963076	I've been playing, was it, Work Time Fun right now, and that game is so stupid and awful, but I can't stop playing it.
2963096	2963676	I don't know why.
2963816	2966897	Jvmon says, Loki is the king of OLR, and Rob is his puppet.
2968077	2968497	There you go.
2969238	2976760	RossDLUT, who I've been quoting a lot tonight, I guess I like the cynics tonight, because RossDLUT's kind of our in-house cynic, says, Loki, very fucking insightful.
2977100	2978261	What makes a game fun?
2978441	2979441	Um, the game's fun?
2980561	2981182	Thanks for watching!
2996091	2997151	I like blowing stuff up.
2997431	3001432	I like writing boobs in places I shouldn't be able to and naming things.
3001612	3005433	I mean, everybody finds something different to be fun, usually, right?
3005773	3006233	It's whatever.
3006293	3007674	It doesn't matter what I find fun.
3007714	3008814	It's whatever you find fun.
3008834	3013335	If you don't want to trust my judgment with buying a game, you can always go rent it.
3013635	3018636	I mean, and that's a lot cheaper, and I'm sure a lot of the mom and pop shops out there would really appreciate that from you.
3018816	3022817	DarkTetsuya says, Tonight's OLR has been brought to you by D3 and by GameTap.
3023097	3023417	Hey, I...
3024097	3028682	I neglected to say I played GameTap during my gaming week because I just needed to leave it out for once, alright?
3028702	3031725	Because I knew there was going to be that fucking comment at some point.
3031845	3033647	And you know what?
3034027	3044638	I'm not on D3 payroll, that's for sure, but at least they have the balls to bring over games that might not necessarily work over here, like Earth Defense Force, and they have that one that's coming out at one point.
3045138	3050582	on the 360 where you're like some chick in lingerie with a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword.
3051002	3054645	That might not necessarily do well over here, but at least they're going to give it a shot.
3054665	3055846	What the fuck are you talking about?
3055866	3056667	That sounds awesome.
3056687	3058008	That's the name of the game.
3058028	3058908	I don't remember what it's called.
3058928	3062551	It's got some long Japanese name and I'm not even going to attempt to remember what it was.
3064012	3069357	Uh, let's see, um, Actdeft says, uh, Pac-Man Championship Edition is fun, yet Loki doesn't see that.
3069437	3072780	Well, because everybody, I think Pac-Man Championship Edition is a hell of a lot of fun.
3072941	3080207	It's way more fast-paced than the old one, which I think is awesome, and, you know, the Ray-Ban music and everything, but Loki, I'm just not a fan of Pac-Man that much.
3080227	3086633	But see, I love the retro, like, really, really retro classics and updates and that stuff, you know, like the old school arcade games.
3086653	3089356	It's just like I'm playing Zelda 2 now for some reason, and I don't know why.
3090203	3090464	Zelda 2?
3090504	3091925	Because it's a good game.
3092526	3093006	Not really.
3093166	3093847	Yes it is.
3094688	3095569	It's like a great game.
3095629	3096109	I think it's great.
3096149	3097411	I think I need to buy that on the Wii.
3097471	3098992	You totally do.
3099333	3099973	What else was I going to say?
3100093	3103417	Any other fun factor games that people are overlooking right now?
3105154	3106955	I think about Katamari Damacy.
3107056	3108337	I mean, what sold that game?
3108677	3110959	The fun factor and the fact that it was a low price.
3111099	3114782	But the game itself was, you know, it wasn't exactly graphically the most impressive.
3114802	3118485	It was just like, you know, you would ask people, what draws you to Katamari Damacy?
3118505	3120927	And people just go, it's fucking fun to roll over shit.
3121207	3122569	And then, of course, you have your cynics.
3123429	3125351	There's one everybody should say, that game sucks.
3125691	3127113	You know they're welcome to that opinion.
3127333	3128314	I would recommend it.
3128394	3132337	I mean, and this would be pretty hard to find nowadays, but if you can, find it.
3132757	3135500	And I don't recommend buying it, but if you can rent it.
3136204	3136684	Driver 3.
3137405	3140006	I know, I know, it's such a horrible game.
3140266	3145810	But it's really a game that you need to play because you're just like, oh my god, I can't believe it's really this bad.
3146090	3147771	And it's entertaining in that aspect.
3147991	3153274	My sister is borrowing my PlayStation 2 and we have that game dumped on the hard drive so she can play it.
3153734	3156216	And I swear to god, she plays this thing more than anything else.
3156856	3157537	on that damn system.
3157617	3163022	They will sit there for hours recording instant replays and watching the AI get all fucked up.
3163183	3166045	Driver 3 is the showgirls of gaming.
3166126	3167487	It's so bad, it's pretty good.
3168848	3175395	It's just, you know, there's a lot of games out there that are really hard to, a lot of people overlook that are fun.
3175415	3177817	You just really have to play a lot of the stuff.
3178198	3179479	Saints Row is another one that I love.
3180006	3180547	New email.
3180567	3182631	Oh man, Saints Row, the musical.
3183232	3184094	That was so funny.
3184554	3185957	Only three emails tonight.
3185977	3186879	Here's the second one.
3187921	3189564	And this is from The Doctor.
3190342	3191163	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3219402	3224748	urge her to leave her friend code in our forums because we actually have a forum post for Pokemon friend codes.
3225889	3227530	Moving on back to the doctor's email.
3227590	3228591	Second is for Sky.
3228792	3229452	I heart you.
3229933	3230333	Oh, thank you.
3230793	3235138	And could you say, excuse me, DarkSakura, again, please, please, please.
3235658	3236279	I'll see what I can do.
3237017	3238138	Third is for Loki.
3267503	3268244	Thanks for watching!
3283358	3285280	Really, they can be as hard as you want to make them, I guess.
3285560	3288102	There was, oh my god, and I don't remember the guy.
3288163	3294268	There's this one Japanese guy that had a website with edits on there, and they were the fucking shit.
3294408	3299713	I don't remember who the guy is now because I haven't been playing edits for a long time, but I don't know.
3299733	3305938	If you look for some DDR edit websites, this guy is just amazing.
3306118	3307980	And he had a bunch of ASCII artists on his site, so.
3308697	3311858	I don't know, I wish I could be more helpful there, but some great stuff.
3311878	3317040	They had one for, it was called Swingman, that was on... I remember that.
3317080	3320882	It was on the jazz, and it was an awesome edit.
3320902	3323783	It had just this real flow to it that was really cool.
3324564	3325944	One last question from the doctor.
3326404	3330466	When did Squaresoft become Square Enix, and why?
3330866	3332487	Or as we call them here on the show, Squeenix.
3333823	3335604	When did Square Enix become... Why?
3335924	3337185	It was, what, about three years ago?
3337265	3338086	Two or three years ago.
3338146	3341028	They bought Enix, which made a bunch of games.
3341168	3345931	Dragon Quest is probably their most popular series of games, which you may know as Dragon Warrior.
3346592	3347752	Years ago, it was called.
3348533	3350334	And what else did they make?
3350694	3356418	I know on Super Nintendo, they were very popular for Brain Lord and Illusion of Gaia and those games.
3356858	3361962	And then later on, I also know for music game fans, they were the folks that made Bust a Move.
3361982	3363663	Did they do the Tobol series?
3364043	3365084	Well, excuse me, Dark Sakura!
3390802	3391122	DarkSakura
3420808	3422110	I'm so gonna get beat up.
3422751	3424353	Love you, Jamie, wherever you are.
3425254	3426356	Anyhow, one more email.
3427848	3433271	And this one wasn't signed, so I don't really know who to say who this is from.
3433492	3434792	I don't even know if I want to read the name.
3435273	3437654	Ikuma is in the header, so we'll just say it's from them.
3438234	3439335	It says, Hi there.
3439795	3444638	I've been listening for one and a half year, and just want to take this opportunity to wish you guys happy 5th.
3445159	3450021	I am a developer in Japan, and yes, Rob had once mentioned our game in the new release section.
3450382	3452683	We all just love it when Rob reads in Japanese.
3453023	3454504	And then there's a cute little face there.
3454964	3456786	And who says no love from developer?
3456866	3457326	Ha ha ha.
3457847	3460889	Hope you guy would be part of my Friday for another five years to come.
3461189	3461650	There you go.
3461990	3470936	So, unfortunately, this person didn't say who they are, what developer they're talking about, or any of that stuff, just that I have horribly butchered the name of one of their games on the program in the past.
3471096	3471937	That's love, though.
3471957	3472577	That's awesome.
3472617	3473138	That's awesome.
3473158	3473778	That's awesome.
3473798	3475880	Thank you so much for the email.
3476140	3483345	Gee, tell us who you are, because we'd love to have more developers on the show, especially ones that are, you know, crazy enough to listen to this.
3483445	3485587	We'd also love to be invited to Tokyo Game Show.
3485607	3485907	Yeah.
3486127	3488749	DarkTitsuya asks, was it the developer of Dust Cap Extreme 2 Collector's Edition?
3501042	3503282	Probably one of your, like, hamster love games or something.
3503322	3504243	God, I hope so.
3504463	3505263	God, I hope so.
3505423	3505903	Oh, my God.
3505983	3506503	Oh, my God.
3506563	3509804	Please tell me you guys develop one of those, like, hamster games.
3510224	3512964	There's another one of those hamster games coming out over here.
3512984	3514885	There's a couple hamster games coming out over here.
3515225	3517645	I think Hamster Life 2 is coming out over here now.
3517965	3519006	Those Ubisoft games.
3520546	3520826	All right.
3520886	3521646	That was the last email.
3521666	3522866	I'm going to close up the old mailbag.
3523006	3525347	How it comes to the Wii, because I would totally buy that game.
3525547	3527767	God, that made me so happy when I read that email.
3527787	3528588	I was like, oh, good.
3528628	3530508	They're not getting all pissed off that I'm butchering their...
3531345	3532246	Their releases.
3532686	3533587	Funny American.
3535869	3536129	All right.
3536930	3537750	Back to the gaming news.
3538051	3540313	If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelauncher.com.
3540533	3545016	If you're from an American, Canadian, Antarctican developer, who cares?
3545177	3549480	Email us and tell us you're listening because we love to hear that folks in the industry are listening.
3549500	3553664	Dude, totally need to meet up at the arcade in Antarctica to play some DDR.
3553704	3554865	Shut up and get to the next story.
3555225	3559749	Anyways, Civilizations coming to consoles and...
3560382	3568186	Handheld soon, being brought over by 2K Games and developed by FireAxis Games, Civilization Revolution.
3568887	3573989	And it's going to include 16 civilizations to master and lead to victory.
3574330	3578152	And, of course, famous historical leaders, yada, yada, yada.
3578632	3580873	Online multiplayer as well is going to be in it.
3581393	3582234	So, yeah.
3583246	3583706	Pretty cool.
3583846	3588428	I'm not a huge Civilization fan, but it sounds interesting.
3607316	3609317	and Stab Myself with the blunt end gauge.
3610638	3612899	But these are what, spin-off games?
3613140	3614120	Or are these direct ports?
3614600	3615921	I think this is a spin-off series.
3615941	3620284	When I read it, it sounded like a spin-off series, which can go who knows any which way.
3620364	3625727	That could, you know, God, then that makes me worry, is this going to turn out like the Mortal Kombat anthology stories?
3625807	3627328	Remember like the Sub-Zero game?
3628609	3631290	I don't think it's anything like that, but I hope not.
3631310	3634512	You know, it's probably going to be maybe a little bit more scaled down for consoles.
3635493	3635813	I don't know.
3636371	3637172	It sounds okay.
3637552	3639874	Well, do you really need to scale down for consoles?
3641095	3644438	I just could not see the full game itself on an Xbox 360.
3645379	3649682	And the biggest reason why is that there's no mouse, and those thumbsticks don't cut it.
3649722	3653465	Like, some games were meant to be played with a mouse, and that's all there is to it.
3653746	3659631	You know, I don't understand why they just don't have keyboard and mouse support, since it has fucking USB ports.
3659951	3664595	In fact, all of the quote-unquote next-gen, you know,
3665825	3670006	platforms have USB ports that can put a keyboard and mouse on there.
3671306	3674527	Except for maybe the Wii, that'd be kind of stupid because you have the Wii remote, but, you know.
3675007	3679848	Still, though, if you really want to, and if they really would decide to support it, they could put a keyboard and mouse on there.
3680528	3692051	Alright, well, another very popular PC gaming series is Guild Wars, and IGN had an interview this week on their PC side about Guild Wars 2 and the Eye of the North expansion for Guild Wars.
3692411	3694012	You played Guild Wars for a little bit, right?
3694252	3694932	I totally did.
3695012	3695472	And what'd you think?
3696170	3697274	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3700407	3708471	Well, maybe there's something in the Eye of the North for you, because Eye of the North, I was kind of reading through the interview here, and if you want to read the full thing, head over to pc.ign.com and you can read the full thing.
3709431	3718496	What I didn't know, because I didn't know a lot about these games before I was reading the interview, and Eye of the North is actually the first Guild Wars expansion that requires one of the other expansions to play.
3719016	3726300	And the reason for that is that all of the content they've put into this, they put 18 new dungeons, and they're all for, like, endgame characters.
3726540	3726720	Mm-hmm.
3727160	3733106	So, whereas with any of the other expansions, you can buy them by themselves and create a character from the ground up.
3734006	3738831	But for this one, they didn't waste any time making a level 1 through 20 story.
3738891	3742734	It's all like hardcore endgame content, which I think is kind of interesting about that.
3743175	3743475	Totally.
3744423	3747365	And then it kind of went to talking about how they're actually developing the game.
3747965	3751827	Did they actually split into two different development teams?
3751927	3758491	And yes, there's a development team for Guild Wars 2 right now, but then the Eyes of the North people will come over when Guild Wars 2 is done.
3759212	3767596	And they admit that most of the resources are being focused on the Guild Wars expansion, but then they're going to all shift over to Guild Wars 2 once the expansion is done.
3767636	3770238	So this definitely sounds like it's going to be the last Guild Wars expansion.
3771579	3777743	And they actually say that they do kind of tend to monitor the trends in the PvP, like, metagames that people come up with.
3778243	3784027	And then they kind of, like, figure out, use those ideas for, like, live events and holiday events.
3784508	3786089	And they claim them for themselves.
3786109	3788430	They're like, that was my idea!
3788590	3789391	Wait a minute!
3789551	3795195	No, they just sound like they're really tied down to the community, which I think is great.
3795935	3796316	There you go.
3796516	3798037	Some exciting news for Guild Wars fans.
3799022	3799322	Awesome.
3799743	3808831	Anyways, so we've got some interesting stuff, I guess, making its way out to the U.S.
3809251	3810272	Not a whole lot, though.
3810432	3814015	This week's kind of dead, as most of July usually is.
3815957	3824284	Pretty much this week, though, the only things you've got are Ninja Gaiden Sigma for PlayStation 3 and Vampire Reign on the Xbox 360.
3826431	3828232	That is about it.
3828872	3836717	PC games, there's a bunch of weird stuff coming out, including, let's see, well, actually, Marvel treating card games coming out on PC.
3837218	3839099	Title Legends 2 is coming out on PC.
3842000	3843962	Ride, Carnival Tycoon.
3844322	3847804	I swear to God, every fucking week there's a goddamn tycoon game coming out.
3849725	3854808	DS, Platinum Sudoku, and Vegas Casino High Five.
3855489	3856129	Making its way out.
3858035	3860217	So that is it.
3860538	3865283	Alright, let's head on over to the Japanese release dates and check out what's going on in Japan.
3866304	3868126	Is Chicken Shoot coming out this week?
3868306	3869808	Chicken Shoot came out last week, though.
3869908	3870889	Oh my god, did it really?
3871069	3871429	I guess.
3871670	3872731	Oh my god, Chicken Shoot's great.
3872751	3876435	Sorry, because it was on the list over here, but as a US release, so...
3876895	3877816	Boku no Natsusiasa Boku no Natsuyasumi
3900327	3903448	Boku no Natsu Yasumi 3 is coming out.
3903908	3905388	See, the more I practice, the better I get.
3905408	3906948	It's a bug-catching game.
3906968	3908469	Why don't we get anything like that over here?
3908509	3909309	Doesn't that look cute?
3910149	3912369	Maybe that's what Africa is going to actually be all about.
3912449	3912849	Africa.
3913310	3914090	Poaching animals?
3914130	3915050	Yes, you poach animals.
3915990	3916550	That would be fun.
3918330	3925312	I'm assuming that because I see the little guy on the cover of the game is holding a little bug net and a little thing that you keep bugs in.
3925872	3926072	Anyway.
3927156	3930699	Let's see if there's anything else coming out on some of the other platforms that you might be looking forward to.
3930739	3930959	What?
3931780	3935403	It's really crazy kid with bug net murders family.
3936504	3937364	PlayStation 2.
3938465	3946591	Some stuff really just moving into the best hits like Winning Post 7, Ape Escape 3, and Ratchet & Clank 4th is all moving into the best.
3946651	3949994	Not a lot of new stuff coming out otherwise, but some price reductions there.
3951069	3952510	Cururin Donuts, Okashi Recipe
3969318	3973620	I have no idea what that is, but it's got a happy donut on the cover and it's an action game.
3974000	3976961	So it kind of makes it look like it might be a racing game involving donuts.
3977041	3977541	I have no fucking idea.
3977621	3979242	Happy donut action game.
3979482	3981623	Yeah, but who wouldn't want to buy a happy donut action game?
3981743	3982243	I don't know.
3982263	3983964	I'd buy a happy donut action game.
3984004	3985164	Poochie Poochie Virus.
3988065	3990266	Sounds fascinating and is also coming out on the DS.
3991466	3992687	It's also another action game.
3993939	3998063	with a cast of very chibi-looking characters there, also coming to Japan.
3998463	4003767	Quickly looking to see if there's anything on the PSP this week in Japan.
4005549	4011254	Just some games going into the best hits, including Rengoku 2, The Stairway to Heaven.
4011894	4013956	Or Hell, depending on how you look at it.
4015417	4017799	Alright, going over to the European release dates.
4018360	4021523	DarkSakura, sadly not here this week, but on July 6th,
4022436	4033244	Those of you over in Europe can look forward to The King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2 and The King of Fighters 11 on the PlayStation 2 as well as the Metal Slug Anthology coming out on the PlayStation 2.
4034004	4034645	That's really it.
4035045	4037367	It's a very slow week for those of you guys in Europe.
4039188	4040589	Alright, that does it for release dates.
4041169	4041990	Well, um...
4042614	4062383	You know, it may be a little too soon, but the VTech report covering what happened with the shootings at Virginia Tech, apparently there's no mention of the video game issue, despite the fact that everybody was saying, hey, video games made him kill people, da-da-da-da-da.
4062423	4064984	So that's interesting.
4065284	4070907	But apparently the PAC, though, they've denounced the report saying that it's a cover-up
4071445	4076348	and they're claiming, you know, that really it was video games to blame and it's this giant cover-up.
4076488	4077409	Oh, shut up.
4077809	4078390	Seriously.
4079611	4081152	Shut the hell up, people.
4081692	4084354	Why do people want to blame video games for everything?
4086435	4086835	I don't know.
4087136	4093700	It's just, you know, people want to focus on whatever their agenda is and if they really have, you know,
4094503	4094983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4118419	4121680	Chat room, chat.orangehauntradio.com, live on Sunday nights.
4121820	4125941	Solid Goomba says, didn't they search his room and not even find a single console?
4126061	4127321	I seem to remember that to be the case.
4127421	4139084	Exactly, just because he participates in a goddamn extracurricular activity, which includes playing a computer game, oh my god, oh my god, you know, that doesn't mean that he's trained on that computer game to be a killer.
4139424	4145246	And I'm sorry, but there is no way on the face of the earth to train on a PC game to become a killer.
4146531	4151516	I think for some sad whatever reason, people have the need to blame something.
4152216	4162705	I mean, and obviously what happened at Virginia Tech was just absolutely tremendously horrible, and a lot of us had that reaction of, how could something like this happen?
4162886	4167109	How fucked up is this world that some kid would do this to their peers?
4167209	4172354	And so I think out of that desperation, people look for something to blame, and video games, unfortunately, are an easy target.
4172887	4180312	because, you know, they allow you to pretend that you are someone else and unfortunately not everybody can see that line.
4180392	4187137	I don't even know why this was an issue when they didn't even have any sort of evidence in the beginning that, you know, video games were even involved in any way.
4187397	4189539	But immediately they're saying, oh, it must be this.
4189819	4195022	It's Doom, it's Marilyn Manson, it's MTV, it's all this that did this.
4196103	4196303	No.
4196323	4198024	Just take responsibility, people.
4198064	4198605	It was, uh...
4199273	4207019	A crazy, crazy, crazy person that probably, I don't know, I don't even want to speculate because I'll say something that will be foot and mouth syndrome.
4207419	4211942	But, you know, it was a very unfortunate thing, period.
4212122	4213383	I blame World War II.
4214484	4215344	That's what I blame.
4216565	4220628	It's all those, you know, World War II documentaries out there that show the kamikazes.
4220688	4221569	That's what I blame.
4221929	4224911	I blame the Atari 2600, don't you?
4225952	4226292	I do.
4226492	4228674	I mean, they have the man bomber after all in there.
4229484	4230025	Thanks for watching!
4247048	4247709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4265825	4271007	So I don't know if it's going to actually support ROMs or if you're going to buy games a la iTunes or what the deal is.
4271227	4274628	Because it's really easy to get free Atari games online at this point.
4274928	4280170	I swear to God, the entire collection of Atari games, everything ever made, is six megs.
4280630	4283170	So you could easily fit that on a USB card.
4283311	4284051	It's very tiny.
4284351	4287892	But what I would like to see that used for is maybe some homebrew.
4287912	4291013	Because, you know, even the Atari 2600 still has some homebrew love.
4291493	4292573	A lot of homebrew love for it.
4292593	4293614	So you never know what might happen.
4294214	4294314	So.
4294707	4297208	I don't know if I would necessarily buy this though, but I don't know.
4298069	4298869	It depends.
4298889	4301751	If it was like 20 bucks or something, it might be worth it.
4302011	4313356	Games were so simple back then, and sometimes that's kind of like, you know, like I was saying last week, I found myself playing Pitfall for God knows what reason for quite a chunk of time on last Saturday.
4313436	4318719	Can you imagine, if you will, if they were to bring combat to Xbox Live Arcade?
4319719	4322120	and have like leaderboards for that shit, that'd be fucking awesome.
4322140	4324481	Weren't they going to bring some old Atari classics?
4324501	4327683	Like I seem to remember Warlords was coming to Xbox Live.
4327703	4328663	That's an old school Atari game.
4328883	4330264	And of course we have Centipede and Millipede.
4330624	4333285	I want combat with no graphical upgrades whatsoever.
4333405	4335146	I just want the whole thing to be done like that.
4335766	4340168	What if they did the classic graphics slash upgrade graphics?
4340208	4341829	I guess if they really want to do that.
4341849	4344970	But I'd be fine with just the classic graphics because I think that'd be funny.
4345611	4348392	And just have like a leaderboard thing where you know...
4350095	4352096	So I did not realize you were such an Atari 2600 fan.
4352116	4355257	Oh, I used to play the Atari 2600 all the time.
4355437	4356397	I'm a huge Combat fan.
4356517	4357897	Oh, keep that in mind for later on.
4357917	4359438	We're going to see what happens later on.
4359758	4363139	I'm going to tease something coming up in Part B. That's all I have to say.
4363919	4364539	Alright, moving on.
4365140	4365540	Anyways, so...
4367361	4372444	Apparently, the ESRB is cracking down on violent game trailers now.
4373604	4390733	Nothing really new, but of course, especially after the whole fiasco with Manhunt 2, they're kind of, I guess, taking notice on some of the trailers that have been released out there, including Gears of War, which was available online since January, is now, of course, coming down.
4391533	4396836	And apparently, Darkness and Dark Sector videos have been
4398078	4406345	immediately, I guess, pulled because, I guess, they were too bloody or whatever and, I guess, were an adult-only thing.
4406665	4412670	You know, they should have such a thing as a Red Band trailer for games, I think, but I don't know.
4412710	4423178	I think it's kind of stupid, though, since, you know, before they were rating them with, you know, oh, because they're interactive and stuff, we've got to rate them a little harsher, which is dumb anyways, but you're watching a video of gameplay.
4423198	4425100	You don't have any sort of interaction with it.
4425240	4426461	I think, you know,
4427682	4428262	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4449432	4452153	where the preview is for restricted audiences only.
4452613	4458555	That's because they'll have a gunshot in it or a real quick bloodshot or maybe some boobie.
4458575	4463716	It might be an ad for a sexy movie and you see a lady wearing a dress that's see-through or something.
4463736	4466157	You see Red Band trailers once in a while.
4466357	4473859	I think it's kind of ridiculous that they're policing game trailers because that's not even... It's not the actual game.
4473899	4475180	It's kind of a video.
4475260	4476060	They'd be like,
4477003	4486130	I know that they do that with movie trailers, you know, that they rate that this trailer isn't good for all audiences and stuff, but I think it's kind of ridiculous to do that with games.
4486310	4492174	I could have sworn I heard some point that yellow bands were coming for the PG-13 and up audiences only.
4492494	4502981	I couldn't, I can't remember, maybe it was R, no, yeah, it was PG-13 audiences only were going to have yellow band trailers, but I don't know if that ever, I might just be pulling that out of my butt, but I seem to remember reading that somewhere.
4503582	4503862	I don't know.
4504565	4509226	Well, obviously this next topic is rated G. This is definitely for everybody.
4510286	4510926	This cat!
4511447	4511967	Wait, hold on!
4512847	4517348	DarkSakura is not here this week, so we can't do a website of the week.
4517388	4522029	But if she could, and she was here this week, I'm pretty sure this would have been a top contender for her website of the week.
4522069	4524049	Okay, yes, Loki, you can do your outburst now.
4524089	4526370	Sorry, this cat right here made me get a cat.
4527336	4527616	Really?
4527656	4528057	Why is that?
4528517	4530938	Because it's super cute, and I want a gaming cat.
4531159	4544587	All right, well, yes, this is the Famico blog, and you can visit this blog if you'd like to at lovefami.blog90.fc2.com, and this is just a cat that poses with it.
4544967	4547169	They make poses of it playing the DS and the 360.
4548150	4548950	Did you ever see the other?
4548970	4549530	It's so cute.
4549951	4550411	Yeah, see?
4550471	4551292	I mean, look at that one up.
4551712	4552032	One more.
4552292	4552612	One more up.
4552973	4553473	It was that one.
4553493	4553933	Keep going down.
4554554	4555034	Yeah, keep going.
4556238	4556699	and DarkSakura.com.
4584028	4585269	This is so cute.
4585369	4586830	Go, go, go.
4586850	4587570	That's a picture right there.
4589732	4590672	That is a very cute cat.
4591933	4593975	And I believe the cat's name is Famicom, right?
4594235	4596556	It's Fami, or Fami, named after the Famicom.
4597537	4598077	Very cute.
4598177	4599178	Named after famine.
4599498	4603681	Are you wanting to... You're so messed up.
4604362	4606383	Are you wanting to get a kitty someday, Rice Princess?
4606503	4606663	No.
4607584	4607824	Oh, okay.
4608470	4610231	I just wanted you to contribute something to this show.
4610251	4616837	I am going to attempt to get the cat that we're getting to sit there in a pose that'll look like it's playing DS.
4617277	4619399	I don't think it's going to work, but we're going to try it.
4619559	4623522	You know what you need to do is get the cat to pose reading porn.
4624022	4624883	That would be funny.
4625424	4626064	Get a picture of that.
4626084	4627405	I don't have any porn.
4627425	4629066	At least not in magazine form.
4629086	4630347	How can you not have porn?
4630568	4632129	I'll get my laptop and put porn on it.
4632149	4635952	I will buy you a freaking Playboy or something and you can pose the cat with porn.
4636551	4638373	and have it drinking alcohol.
4639434	4641777	Yes, you should be Stella the Porno Cat.
4644820	4645981	You should get a little pimp hat.
4646582	4646902	Oh, boy.
