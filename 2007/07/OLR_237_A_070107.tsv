0	14280	We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Wonky.
14280	20840	Tonight July 1st, 2007, Soulcalibur IV goes online, The World of Civilization comes to
20840	32520	consoles and our achievements about to get product placement.
32520	36600	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36600	37600	Radio.
37600	42520	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42520	43520	My name is Rob Roberts.
43520	45160	You might know me as Sky.
45160	48400	Not joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48400	52840	She has the night off, as many of you longtime listeners of the show may know.
52840	55960	She's been very active in taking up massage therapy.
55960	59520	She has a little bit of a conflict with her schooling tonight, but the show must go on,
59520	61520	and joining me as always, say hello to Lokey.
61520	62520	Hello.
62520	63800	How are you doing, Lokey?
63800	64800	I'm doing okay.
64800	66880	I just scoffed down a sandwich.
66880	69280	Yeah, you had like a large Quiznos.
69280	70280	It wasn't like a...
70280	71280	Regular size.
71280	72280	Was it?
72280	73280	Yeah, it was a regular size.
73280	78120	It was a balancing act with a sandwich, and also it is spicy, so it's like, you know...
78120	79880	Spicy sandwich.
79880	82160	Regular size, black Angus steak sandwich.
82160	83160	All right.
83160	84160	Yum, yum.
84160	85160	Yum, yum.
85160	87760	But not that we endorse any particular commercial products here on this program.
87760	88760	No.
88760	89760	No.
89760	90760	All right.
90760	93360	Filling in tonight of sorts, we have Rice Princess joining us tonight.
93360	94360	Hello.
94360	95360	How are you doing?
95360	96360	Is your mic on, sweetie?
96360	97360	I don't know.
97360	98360	We didn't hear you there.
98360	99360	It totally is on now.
99360	102360	You're just a little quieter than DarkSakura is, so we'll just adjust your volume.
102360	104360	Very professional radio, but that's what happens when you're live.
104360	105360	Try again.
105360	106360	Great idea.
106360	107360	Okay.
107360	108360	Good job.
108360	109360	That's all right.
109360	111360	Say hello to our listeners, and I'll adjust you on the fly here.
111360	112360	Okay.
112360	113360	Hi, listeners.
113360	114360	How's it going?
114360	115360	Good.
115360	116360	Thanks.
116360	117360	I don't know.
117360	122160	If you want to tell Rice Princess how you're doing, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
122160	128280	We do tape live here on Sunday nights at orangelaungeradio.com, and Rice Princess will just be helping us get a third
128280	134040	perspective tonight, but also the chat room is there, as always, to give us a million
134040	135040	more perspectives.
135040	136040	Yes.
136040	137040	You're right.
137040	138040	You're in the chat room.
138040	139040	Maybe.
139040	140040	That would be the best thing ever.
140040	141440	Well, not in the chat room.
141440	143240	Four or five different opinions in the chat room.
143240	144240	Yeah.
144240	145240	And one of them's a robot.
145240	146240	Over and over.
146240	147240	All right.
147240	151880	Anyhow, let's start off tonight's show with a little bit of how is your gaming week, where
151880	154040	we talk about what we've been playing this week.
154040	157040	Loki, I guess you're going to start us off tonight.
157040	158040	Okay.
158040	161040	Well, this week I've been playing some interesting things.
161040	165040	Some have actually, you know, people have been questioning why I'm playing them, like
165040	167120	the Transformers game, for one.
167120	170760	I was playing that on 360.
170760	172200	It's okay.
172200	177760	It's kind of like I like the game like I like Driver 3.
177760	185040	It's a poorly put together game, and it has some blatant flaws in it, but it's okay.
185040	186040	It's just like what?
186040	187040	The same type of graphical stuff?
187040	188040	Okay.
188040	191360	Let me put some examples in place here.
191360	196960	When I first started the game, immediately there was a big pileup of cars in the street
196960	200600	because they couldn't figure out how to turn the corner correctly.
200600	202240	So that was kind of funny.
202240	206080	The other thing is if you throw anything at anything in the game, you know, pretty much
206080	208800	like you can throw a road cone at a building.
208800	214560	Well, what happens is when you hit something with said road cone, shrapnel comes off the
214560	215560	building.
215560	219720	Well, that shrapnel hits another building and then more shrapnel comes off that building
219720	222040	and sometimes it goes back to the original building.
222040	227880	So you can literally destroy an entire block by just throwing a road cone at something.
227880	231360	And so that's kind of fascinating at the same time.
231360	234720	First comment of the night, Dark Tetsuya in our chat room says, Loki, testers not doing
234720	235720	their job?
235720	237040	Of course not.
237040	239300	It was definitely a rush game.
239300	243420	Is it that testers aren't doing their job or is it that testing gets their corners cut
243420	246520	because the game has a strict deadline of trying to be out in time to move?
246520	247520	I think it's probably corners cut.
247520	249220	That's what I figured.
249220	254400	But other stuff that's kind of crappy in the game, oh, the very first boss that I fought
254400	261200	in Autobot's campaign killed himself.
261200	262200	Suicide man.
262200	266400	We were fighting in this, I don't even know what it's supposed to be, like a power plant
266400	273800	or something like that and they have all these explosive, I guess, propane tanks or something
273800	274800	all around.
274800	277820	And unfortunately, you set off one and the whole place goes up.
277820	283400	So he was just swinging this giant chain at me or something and I got knocked back by
283400	287640	the first propane blast and he got caught in the middle of all the other ones going
287640	288740	off at the same time.
288740	295960	So I actually never fired one shot at him and he ended up killing himself.
295960	299520	A lot of our chatters are big fans of Transformers, looking forward to the movie.
299520	302400	And I understand you actually got to see a little sneak peek of the movie.
302400	304840	I got to see the movie last Wednesday.
304840	305840	Awesome.
305840	306840	How was it?
306840	307840	It was awesome.
307840	308840	Why?
308840	309840	What was awesome about it?
309840	315120	It was awesome because the action in the movie is just non-stop throughout the thing.
315120	320440	It's very similar to Independence Day, how it jumps back and forth between different
320440	324020	character story arcs and stuff like that.
324020	330440	So you've got that plus in the beginning of the movie when Scorponok comes out and stuff,
330440	333240	spears a guy through the chest and pulls him into the ground.
333240	336160	Right there I was like, fuck yeah, this is going to be awesome.
336160	338040	Any spoilers?
338040	339920	There is a couple of spoilers I was going to mention.
339920	341640	These are kind of cameos towards the end of the movie.
341640	346760	Remember that rumor going around that there was going to be an Xbox 360 robot in the movie?
346760	353760	There is, briefly, a cameo because the Allspark causes things to come alive.
353760	358120	So one of the things that happens to get set off by this is a 360, so you see this guy
358120	363640	carrying it out of a GameStop or something, but it busts out the side just for half a
363640	364640	second.
364640	368440	And then there is a Mountain Dew machine robot, which is funny, shooting cans at people, so
368440	371720	brief little cameos there.
371720	375060	But it is an excellent movie, highly recommended if you like action movies.
375060	378160	If you are looking for a deep story line or something like that, you are not going to
378160	379960	find it here, but it is good.
379960	384200	Okay, unfortunately we are radio and not television, so you can't really see everything that goes
384200	389620	on here in studio, but Rice Princess is making her patented Laura Roslin face.
389620	393740	And the Laura Roslin face is, if you've ever watched Battlestar Galactica, you know, what's
393740	394740	the actress' name?
394740	395740	Mary McDonald?
395740	396740	Is that it?
396740	397740	I think that's what it is, yeah.
397740	401060	Like, you know, the actress, whenever something negative happens, she has this very distinct
401060	405520	look where she kind of scrunches up her nose and her mouth, and like Irene or Rice Princess
405520	407320	has that look down pat.
407320	409920	So when she's displeased with something, it's the Laura Roslin look.
409920	412920	So why are you giving this review of the Laura Roslin look?
412920	416760	Okay, the Xbox turning into a Transformer.
416760	418520	It's in there for like two seconds.
418520	419520	I know.
419520	420520	It's quick.
420520	423140	That's like subliminal advertising, like ew.
423140	424140	I mean, come on.
424140	427520	The cars that are in this movie are being used as advertising.
427520	432200	Yeah, but you didn't see an Xbox 360 in the original Transformers cartoon.
432200	434200	Well, it's been updated.
434200	437920	They didn't want them to look all blocky and stupid like the cartoon.
437920	441520	That's okay, but there were cars in the original one, so of course there's going to be cars
441520	445480	in this one, but an Xbox 360, come on, Microsoft.
445480	447040	They don't even show the 360.
447040	451680	All they show is the white premium box and an arm punch out the side, you know, and that's
451680	455520	it and the guy drops it and it's there for literally one to two seconds.
455520	456520	I would drop it too because it's an Xbox.
456520	460600	I caught it, you know, real briefly, but a lot of people probably won't even notice it.
460600	462840	It does not detract from the film whatsoever.
462840	465480	It's not like, let's call Xbox 360 robot.
465480	466680	He will defeat everybody.
466680	468960	I mean, it's not anything like that at all.
468960	474640	So he will charge you, you know, 800 Microsoft points for every projectile that he throws.
474640	475640	Exactly.
475640	476640	There are a few.
476640	478480	Yeah, it's a good movie.
478480	479480	I liked it.
479480	480640	I cannot wait to see it again.
480640	485640	I keep forgetting that Rice Princess is like really anti-Xbox and Microsoft.
485640	487480	Then remind me again real quick, why are you so-
487480	492120	I'm not super anti-Xbox and Microsoft.
492120	493120	I'm not.
493120	496520	I don't even know much about, you know, Microsoft to really hate them.
496520	499320	I just don't prefer them.
499320	501200	Like they're very underwhelming to me.
501200	503720	Didn't you tell me it has to do really with the games that they offer though, that there's
503720	506600	not a lot of like- That's what I'm saying, like I'm very underwhelmed
506600	508800	because they don't have anything to offer to me.
508800	512320	Everything appeals to me on that system.
512320	515440	You need to see the Eternal Sonata demo though if you haven't yet because that seems like
515440	516440	a Japanese RPG.
516440	520960	I have actually seen it and it does look really pretty and I would totally play it.
520960	522600	Maybe Blue Dragon in the future?
522600	526640	She made the Roslin face like a second ago, you're getting so good at that.
526640	527640	I know.
527640	531120	I've been practicing for a long time, but yeah, I don't know.
531120	537000	Blue Dragon might be cool, I don't know, we'll see, but definitely the other one looked really
537000	538000	good.
538000	543400	All right, anyhow, let's see, Ross Steel UT seems to agree with you in chat room.
543400	546160	Xbox 360 is all first person shooter.
546160	547440	It's not all first person shooter.
547440	552720	He also says, listen to Loki blindly defend a shitty unrelated marketing ploy.
552720	557760	It is a blatant ploy, but the whole movie has blatant product placement everywhere.
557760	561400	I mean come on, a fucking Mountain Dew robot.
561400	566680	Enough movie chat, game chat, sorry to interrupt your gaming week, but anyways, what else?
566680	572000	Other than that, actually I bought Nellie the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
572000	580120	for the Wii, which I might add has the worst cameras ever in a game, it's so awful, but
580120	581120	she likes it.
581120	582120	It's Harry Potter.
582120	584200	I think she actually finished it.
584200	585520	I forgot that was out.
585520	587840	Do you really cast spells with the Wiimote and everything?
587840	588840	Heck yeah.
588840	589840	It's okay.
589840	593320	It's just the whole game, it sounds fun, you get to cast spells and stuff, but the whole
593320	595240	game is doing tasks for people.
595240	600600	It's like running around this stupid place and doing meaningless tasks like, I've lost
600600	601880	my stuff.
601880	603520	People have hidden it somewhere in Hogwarts.
603520	604520	Go find it.
604520	610640	Well, thank you for giving me no hints whatsoever and Hogwarts isn't exactly small, so it takes
610640	614760	a lot of time and there's also a lot of things where if you forget what you're supposed to
614760	618600	be doing, you go back and ask them, they won't give you any hints to what you're supposed
618600	619600	to do or something like that.
619600	626120	A lot of the puzzles are hard to figure out what they want you to do.
626120	631360	The combat in the game using the wand and stuff is pretty stupid because Nellie didn't
631360	638160	really have a grasp on any sort of strategy, so she was just swinging the remote around
638160	644060	like crazy and it won every battle.
644060	647680	It's cool if you love Harry Potter, you'll definitely like the game.
647680	652920	I would recommend though, probably don't get it on the Wii, maybe get it on the 360 or
652920	654320	the Playstation 3.
654320	658600	The Wii-mote waving for your spells is not all that, it's not all that.
658600	664120	I'm not sure if in the normal, like the 360 and the Playstation 3, if you use the other
664120	669440	analog stick as maybe a camera look or something, but I know in the Wii version, it was hard
669440	673240	to even face in the right direction for certain things.
673240	676560	You'd be facing at what you want to cast a spell at, pull out your wand and you'd turn
676560	677560	around.
677560	681480	It's like, come on, what the hell?
681480	683120	It looks cool.
683120	688180	The other games I've been playing on the PSP, I actually Wipeout Pulse, which is not out
688180	690560	over here in the U.S. yet, but it's okay.
690560	691560	It's just like Wipeout.
691560	695840	I've played a lot of Wipeout Pure before and it's very similar to that.
695840	701160	Looks almost like a Playstation 2 game, but pretty awesome, so that's going to be coming
701160	702600	out in September.
702600	706520	The other game I've been playing is Final Fantasy, the remake on the PSP, and that's
706520	708200	actually really awesome looking.
708200	711960	You showed that to me and I played it for about 15 seconds and I'm so fucking sold
711960	712960	on it.
712960	714720	The game is freaking gorgeous.
714720	716800	The screenshots don't do it justice.
716800	718480	The game looks so beautiful.
718480	719480	It's amazing.
719480	720720	It's just amazing.
720720	723560	We're actually going to get married, me and the game.
723560	724880	You and Final Fantasy are going to get married?
724880	725880	We totally are.
725880	728080	We've already discussed this.
728080	734240	The last game I was playing was a game called Zainid Revolution, I think, and it's a sequel
734240	740160	to an Xbox shooter game, like one of the shoot-em-ups that came out probably very late in the Xbox
740160	742680	life cycle.
742680	743680	It's kind of different.
743680	745560	This one now is a 3D shooter.
745560	750240	You're kind of going towards the screen, I guess.
750240	755680	It's still got the shoot-em-up aspect stuff in the game, but after seeing games that are
755680	759520	free, like No Gravity and stuff, I'm sorry.
759520	762720	The background of the whole game is just a full motion video and you can see artifacts
762720	767000	and stuff, it's just not very good when a free game like No Gravity does everything
767000	771280	in real time and it looks amazing for no money.
771280	776720	So I'd probably hold off on buying that, but it's pretty cool, though.
776720	779960	Definitely get Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II when those come out.
779960	780960	Awesome games.
780960	781960	All right.
781960	782960	I'll go next.
782960	787040	Ashley Rice Francis, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
787040	789040	Okay.
789040	794800	My quite substantial gaming week that consists of just nothing, really.
794800	795800	You didn't play any games?
795800	796800	I played WoW.
796800	797800	Oh, oh, oh!
797800	802160	Did we get into what we're doing with WoW?
802160	803160	Go for it.
803160	805300	Why don't you tell us about what we're doing with WoW, since you play nothing but World
805300	806300	of Warcraft these days?
806300	807720	Yeah, pretty much, because I don't have time.
807720	811340	Now, just to say, because some folks might go, then why should I believe anything she
811340	815680	has to say about gaming, but that's just because your living situation right now, you just
815680	816680	don't have any...
816680	817680	I work two jobs.
817680	818680	I don't have time to game.
818680	819680	Okay.
819680	820680	So shut your fucking face, people.
820680	821680	Anyway...
821680	822680	Why are you on this show?
822680	823680	I don't really know.
823680	824680	To say...
824680	825680	To cuss a lot.
825680	826680	I don't know.
826680	827680	Okay.
827680	830160	But we're going to be creating a twink guild.
830160	831160	What's a twink guild?
831160	832160	It's a guild...
832160	833480	I know we've had this discussion on a previous show.
833480	836240	I'm not going to go to the porno-related side of this.
836240	837240	Just tell us straight up.
837240	838240	What is this guild all about?
838240	840240	The guild's all about PvP.
840240	845160	We're going to be doing Mursangulch and Narathi Basin, and we're going to stay at level 29,
845160	850400	because it's like... so we can do AB, and it's the first one we can do it at.
850400	851400	Everyone knows what twinks are.
851400	856600	They're just the really super awesome characters that have all the best gear and all the best
856600	862960	enchants and all that stuff, and we're going to make it based on Battlestar Galactica characters.
862960	866300	That's the nerdiest part, is everyone in the guild's named themselves after a character
866300	868800	from Battlestar Galactica, and the guild's called what?
868800	869800	The Frackers?
869800	870800	The Frackers.
870800	872800	Isn't that the best thing ever?
872800	873800	Stupidest thing ever.
873800	875760	You're the stupidest thing ever.
875760	878520	What level have you gotten your character up to for the PvP guild?
878520	883160	I haven't even made it yet, but we've been in discussions for it.
883160	884960	Even mine's level 6.
884960	887320	What's your name again?
887320	888320	It's Liadama.
888320	889320	Liadama?
889320	890320	Oh, you nerd!
890320	891320	Liadama's mine.
891320	892320	Shut up.
892320	893320	You shut up.
893320	896480	Mine's going to be Tyrrell, because he's hot and sexy and nobody likes him, except for
896480	897480	me.
897480	899560	So I'm like, whatever, I'll take his name.
899560	902600	Who else do we have in our PvP guild?
902600	903600	A lot.
903600	905240	I'm pretty sure there's a Roslin.
905240	906240	I think...
906240	908400	I don't know if there is a Roslin.
908400	913520	One of our guilds said they wanted to be a real bitch, so we said do Admiral Cain.
913520	917440	Yeah, oh my god, isn't that the best thing ever?
917440	918440	She's my hero.
918440	922400	So that's pretty much it on my end of the gaming week.
922400	927240	Alright, let's see.
927240	929280	Rasteel UTS, some advice.
929280	933640	Price Princess, you might have time to game if you didn't upset over that useless time
933640	934640	sink.
934640	937760	In other words, stop playing WoW in your other games.
937760	940000	Oh man, that was hilarious.
940000	942480	Because you're never going to get away from WoW, huh?
942480	943480	Not really, no.
943480	944480	She's giving me Roslin face.
944480	948200	Let's see, my gaming week actually sadly was pretty similar.
948200	952320	I didn't play a whole lot outside of WoW, but I have a good reason, because I was out
952320	953320	of town for three days.
953320	959040	I was in LA and I had to do this thing for work where we stayed all together for this
959040	962400	team building thing away from the society, so I couldn't even get out to an arcade or
962400	966920	a bar or anything, so not a whole lot of time I had to game.
966920	970400	When I was able to play some of the games outside of World of Warcraft, I did play some
970400	976240	stuff on the DS, still playing Puzzle Quest, that game is fun, and I'm hoping to beat it.
976240	981360	And also, even though this isn't a video game, it scores me a ton of nerd points.
981360	987240	I've been playing Survivor, like the TV show, I've been playing Survivor on LiveJournal.
987240	992080	Because a lot of people play Dungeons and Dragons online, so there's Survivor on LiveJournal,
992080	993920	so I'm playing that.
993920	996960	I wasn't the first voted out, thank God.
996960	999400	There you go.
999400	1001520	I was very happy about that.
1001520	1002520	That's pretty much it.
1002520	1005320	I haven't been playing a lot else with my gaming week, although I did check out that
1005320	1009200	Final Fantasy I when Loki let me borrow it for a little bit, and boy, that game looks
1009200	1010200	sexy.
1010200	1014200	I'm going to have to find my PSP and dust it off seriously with Final Fantasy I, II,
1014200	1015200	Tactics, Castlevania.
1015200	1021040	A lot of folks that were dishing out the PSP hate because it didn't have the types of games
1021040	1022360	they were looking for.
1022360	1027740	It's finally coming, a lot of those types of the role-playings and the ports of classics
1027740	1028740	that we love.
1028740	1029740	Yeah.
1029740	1030740	There you go.
1030740	1036960	I was kind of having, I was dishing out PSP uncertainty because there wasn't really, again,
1036960	1039140	it was kind of like the Xbox.
1039140	1043900	There was nothing that was really appealing to me except for Luminous, but now I'm seeing
1043900	1046760	all these games and I'm totally going to invest in one.
1046760	1047760	All right.
1047760	1048760	Yep.
1048760	1050760	I thought I'd interject with that.
1050760	1051760	All right.
1051760	1052760	All right.
1052760	1053760	Well, let's see.
1053760	1056800	Now that we've gone through our gaming weeks, perhaps we should get into some housekeeping
1056800	1061200	tonight and tell you guys about what's going on with us.
1061200	1067540	We are going to be making an appearance at SAC for Sacramento Anime.
1067540	1073040	We're going to be going to that convention, which is, I believe, two weeks off.
1073040	1077520	I think we're going to be making an appearance on Saturday, the 14th.
1077520	1080560	And for those of you that are in the Sacramento area, it's at that hotel that's across Martin
1080560	1081560	Fair Mall.
1081560	1084960	All the details we will have next week, we're still trying to work that out with the folks
1084960	1088000	and I need to make sure even all of us are available or else it's only going to be some
1088000	1089000	of us.
1089000	1093800	However, we will not be taping one of our live usual shows at this convention as we
1093800	1095000	did for Fanime.
1095000	1100920	We will be recording a special bonus show that only folks on the live journal, the MySpace,
1100920	1103120	our communities, will be able to direct download.
1103120	1105200	It will not go into the RSS feed.
1105200	1108640	So if you are interested in keeping tabs on all that type of special stuff that we put
1108640	1113360	out that's extra, check out our live journal community, which is Orange Lounge on Live
1113360	1114900	Journal, or you can check out our MySpace.
1114900	1118600	Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on MySpace.
1118600	1120000	You think I just learned English this week.
1120000	1121000	What the hell is going on?
1121000	1122000	You did.
1122000	1123000	You did.
1123000	1124000	Geez.
1124000	1128240	Well, you know, because last week was the five-year anniversary and all, now this week,
1128240	1129240	we're just set up for disappointment.
1129240	1131240	Like, who gives a fuck anniversary?
1131240	1132240	Exactly.
1132240	1133240	Who gives a fuck anymore?
1133240	1134760	I'm surprised we're here.
1134760	1138020	When you're at the top, you got to have to bring it down a notch and like gradually go
1138020	1140200	down a bit so that you can bring it back up.
1140200	1144240	For 250 because, you know, 250 is a landmark number so you have to bring it up again for
1144240	1145240	that.
1145240	1146240	Totally right.
1146240	1147240	Anyway.
1147240	1148240	Let's see.
1148240	1149240	Other housekeeping.
1149240	1150240	Happy Canada Day.
1150240	1153020	To all our Canadians that are listening, we are taping on July the 1st.
1153020	1154120	So happy Canada Day.
1154120	1155120	To you.
1155120	1156600	It's my six-year anniversary today too.
1156600	1157600	Is it?
1157600	1158600	No.
1158600	1161400	It's the first time that we started dating.
1161400	1162400	Was July 1st, really?
1162400	1163400	Yes.
1163400	1164400	Honestly, it's not like your marriage was in April.
1164400	1165400	No.
1165400	1166400	No.
1166400	1167400	We didn't go through some weird time.
1167400	1168640	You know my parents' anniversary is July 1st too.
1168640	1172200	So happy anniversary, Mommy and Daddy, because they got married on July 1st.
1172200	1177560	And also this week, since it will be this week, to all the American folks that listen,
1177560	1179320	happy 4th of July.
1179320	1183220	And to celebrate our anniversary, we're getting a kitty.
1183220	1184220	Are you really?
1184220	1185220	Yeah, we're getting a kitty.
1185220	1186220	What are you going to name it?
1186220	1190200	Well, the two things that I thought I'd never do, and that's the two things I would never
1190200	1193720	do, buy an Apple product and get a cat because I'm a dog person.
1193720	1194920	But we're getting a cat.
1194920	1196200	I'm not buying an Apple product ever.
1196200	1197200	Not an iPhone?
1197200	1198200	I know.
1198200	1200200	One of our friends got an iPhone.
1200200	1201200	They're pretty sexy.
1201200	1203600	It was bringing sexy back.
1203600	1206320	Just knowing Apple, there will be something even better next year.
1206320	1209320	So I'm going to hold off and hopefully I'll have money because I'm moving soon.
1209320	1212960	Actually, also the countdown is beginning for the last shows in the studio.
1212960	1217280	We're going to be moving to a new room because I'm moving to a new place and hopefully a
1217280	1218280	bigger studio.
1218280	1219760	I hope so.
1219760	1223060	And definitely there will be a webcam in the new studio.
1223060	1224800	So that's something to look forward to.
1224800	1226360	Those shows will debut in August.
1226360	1228880	I think we're going to take a week off while we switch over.
1228880	1232440	And then in August, probably going to hopefully change a lot.
1232440	1237720	I'm hoping we're just going to do a new season, kind of redo Orange Lounge for the new studio
1237720	1238720	and everything.
1238720	1239720	It will be fun.
1239720	1246480	Our new kitty is going to be, she's four months old and her name is Stella.
1246480	1247480	Stella.
1247480	1249040	You already named it?
1249040	1251040	No, we didn't name it.
1251040	1252880	It's a foster cat right now.
1252880	1253880	It's in a foster home.
1253880	1258240	So we are going to be picking it up on Friday.
1258240	1261360	Jake Simmons says, name it Kitty Bobo.
1261360	1264480	And Rosteal UT says, name it Tingle.
1264480	1265880	There you go.
1265880	1267520	Can't name it Tingle.
1267520	1268800	It responds to Stella.
1268800	1271480	We'll see about nicknames.
1271480	1272480	Alright.
1272480	1276040	Also, I wanted to mention this real quickly.
1276040	1279640	You're going to be hearing this a lot, especially those of you guys that listen to a variety
1279640	1281120	of podcasts.
1281120	1284440	You're really going to get sick of hearing this after this month is over.
1284440	1288440	So we're really only going to say this once, but it is that time of year.
1288440	1293560	The podcast awards are open and nominations have started as of today.
1293560	1297560	And of course, we would be tickled pink if we could get nominated again this year.
1297560	1301480	If you want to nominate us, you go over to podcastawards.com.
1301480	1305360	If you need to know our feed URL, there's actually a thread in our forums and I'll link
1305360	1306360	that in chat shortly.
1306360	1307960	It has all the details.
1307960	1311800	Obviously, we would very much appreciate a nomination for best gaming or best people's
1311800	1313780	choice, whatever you want.
1313780	1318400	But if there's a podcast you like better, that's a gaming podcast, hey, no problem.
1318400	1322000	All we really want to see is the independent podcast prevail in this.
1322000	1325760	And last year, even though we weren't nominated, we were very happy to see that five independent
1325760	1326760	podcasts were nominated.
1326760	1329400	And that's the way we want to keep it because you know what, guys?
1329400	1333800	Those podcasts that are owned by the corporates and the big game companies and the big gaming
1333800	1336000	magazines, they don't need the exposure.
1336000	1339720	They have lots of ad dollars that go into their print, their TV.
1339720	1341200	They don't need the exposure.
1341200	1344440	But the independent folks, a podcast award can really help them out because when we won
1344440	1346680	it in 2005, it really did help us out.
1346680	1350620	So please make sure an independent wins it, guys.
1350620	1353920	If it can't be us, we definitely would like to see another independent win it.
1353920	1355480	So there you have it, podcast awards.
1355480	1359280	The nominations are open, I think, through the 15th.
1359280	1363560	And I'm hoping that people will suggest independent podcasts from other categories in our thread
1363560	1367600	on the forums to maybe nominate because I don't know a lot outside of gaming.
1367600	1370600	I know a couple sci-fi and a couple, but not a lot.
1370600	1373480	So I'm hoping we can kind of share and help promote the indie podcasts.
1373480	1374480	Totally.
1374480	1375480	That would be cool.
1375480	1376480	All right.
1376480	1380080	Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's gaming news.
1380080	1381200	Yes.
1381200	1383680	Not a huge surprise, especially with E3 around the corner.
1383680	1387520	We're getting a lot of announcements of what's going to be coming out at E3, what you can
1387520	1392280	expect to be reading about because obviously most of you probably aren't going, including
1392280	1393280	us.
1393280	1394280	Fucking people.
1394280	1399440	Anyways, so one of those, which isn't a big surprise and I'm surprised we haven't seen
1399440	1405480	more of it yet, Killzone 2, Sony's invite for, I believe, their press conference and
1405480	1411660	whatnot was, of course, Killzone themed and they're probably going to be featuring the
1411660	1414000	game playable or in some sort of trailer.
1414000	1415000	I'm guessing playable.
1415000	1419040	I mean, it's got to be coming out pretty soon at the event.
1419040	1425140	So hopefully soon we'll see some more on Killzone 2 and see if it's really this big game that
1425140	1429800	everyone's claiming it to be, or at least everyone in Sony camp.
1429800	1430800	Interesting.
1430800	1437000	Well, we won't really know much about E3 this year because we aren't going, not that we're
1437000	1438000	bitter or anything.
1438000	1439000	No.
1439000	1440000	Completely.
1440000	1441000	Whatever.
1441000	1442840	It's going to be on the internet within five seconds anyway.
1442840	1446800	And we've seen enough of how the gaming industry works on the inside that what's really going
1446800	1452080	to happen is that the game companies will sell the rights to one of those big box gaming
1452080	1453080	companies.
1453080	1457240	And the big box gaming companies will actually post it the day before E3, meaning that all
1457240	1461120	the independent press who actually manages to get into E3 has to run their stories 48
1461120	1462120	hours late.
1462120	1463120	That's the way it's really going to work.
1463120	1464120	So you know what?
1464120	1467160	We're just going to stay at home and steal other people's articles this year because
1467160	1468160	hey, it's the American way.
1468160	1471680	All I know is when these press conferences will be going on, I will not be doing much
1471680	1475080	work at my desk because that's usually the case.
1475080	1478000	I'm usually just getting refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh.
1478000	1479000	Oh, news!
1479000	1480000	Read it.
1480000	1481000	Oh, refresh.
1481000	1483240	Can you watch them live like last year or is it because it's not as big a, you know,
1483240	1485400	that's low key, can't watch that stuff live this year?
1485400	1489240	I can, but at the work, you know, a lot of the internet's blocked.
1489240	1493100	So a lot of the, you know, unless they're streaming it straight off their site and off
1493100	1497320	something else, you know, most likely I can't watch it live.
1497320	1498320	But who cares?
1498320	1501560	You know, if I can read about it, that's all I really care about.
1501560	1502880	I don't think I've told you this.
1502880	1504880	I'll have to tell you a little more, give you details offhand.
1504880	1509680	But one of our other folks that works for Orange Launch Radio on one of the other weeknight
1509680	1514240	shows, actually had some touch with a game company this week and that game company said
1514240	1517520	they'd invite us to E3, but now it's like too late.
1517520	1523200	It's like E3's only 10 days away, I'm like, great, now we got a possible invite and now
1523200	1524200	it's too freaking late.
1524200	1525200	Aww.
1525200	1526200	I know, that sucks.
1526200	1527200	But oh well, maybe next year.
1527200	1528920	I don't know, weekend I'd drive my ass down there.
1528920	1529920	I know.
1529920	1530920	That's the problem.
1530920	1532920	It's like I've already now made commitments of a day job.
1532920	1535480	Originally I was trying to keep that time open because I thought maybe something would
1535480	1536480	come through.
1536480	1539360	Well, you know, I'm not too worried about it because all those demos that are going
1539360	1544680	to be there at E3 are going to be at E4ALL or PAX or whatever we end up going to next
1544680	1547060	and big deal.
1547060	1550280	I sadly can't go to PAX because of a wedding, but I hope somebody from the Orange Launch
1550280	1551880	Radio staff is able to go up there.
1551880	1553320	E4ALL I'm definitely going to though.
1553320	1555800	I'm trying to make it to E4ALL.
1555800	1559920	I don't know if I'll end up making it out there, but I would like to go because it would
1559920	1561560	be nice to see that stuff.
1561560	1563760	Will Rice Princess be going to any of these big gaming conventions?
1563760	1565760	I want to go to BlizzCon.
1565760	1566760	BlizzCon?
1566760	1572080	I can't though because all the tickets sold out within what, fucking four days or something
1572080	1573080	like that?
1573080	1574080	Why does that not surprise me?
1574080	1575080	I know.
1575080	1576080	I think about four hours.
1576080	1577080	Four hours, really?
1577080	1578080	Days, hours, doesn't matter.
1578080	1580920	Yeah, I'm really sad about that, but whatever.
1580920	1582640	I'll go next year.
1582640	1588040	DS68 says the SF Bay area needs a gaming convention, damn it.
1588040	1591600	I agree, except there is a whole game developers conference, which is kind of a big deal.
1591600	1595280	If you remember though, they did try to do something like that.
1595280	1599640	Remember there was that one convention that was in San Francisco, it was a weekend, and
1599640	1601640	I don't remember what exactly it was.
1601640	1604720	I want to say it wasn't sponsored.
1604720	1608200	It might have been sponsored by GameSpa, like a GameSpot expo or something like that.
1608200	1610640	TechTV used to be there.
1610640	1612920	Was it Davis' own GameSpa one time?
1612920	1613920	No.
1613920	1614920	Hello.
1614920	1615920	No, I'm crazy.
1615920	1617880	I think GamePro or something.
1617880	1621680	There was a GameSpot expo, I want to say, that was in San Francisco.
1621680	1622680	It was really small.
1622680	1629160	They only had maybe 15 publishers out there, but from what I remember reading, there wasn't
1629160	1630480	that much response to it.
1630480	1631480	It was pretty crappy.
1631480	1635120	Besides, we're being totally selfish because obviously the SF Bay area is pretty much in
1635120	1636120	our backyard.
1636120	1639000	It's about two hours away, so it's totally drivable, but I'm sure everybody's like,
1639000	1641620	I wish they'd have a gaming convention in my part of town.
1641620	1648200	But the good news is, usually there's at least something small-ish in any type of town, even
1648200	1651440	if it's like an anime slash game convention, which you see a lot of everywhere.
1651440	1658160	I would rather go to Gamers' Days over the giant E3s any day.
1658160	1660840	At least you get more one-on-one time with games.
1660840	1661840	Usually.
1661840	1662840	I kind of agree.
1662840	1665160	Was it the first Konami Gamers' Day that we went to?
1665160	1668520	That was pretty low-key and we got to play pretty much everything.
1668520	1673760	The last one though, not so much because of too much press and the place was kind of smaller
1673760	1678640	and it seemed like, well, we got to get the shot for our TV show, get out of the way type
1678640	1679640	of shit.
1679640	1684200	Everyone's kind of there to do jobs instead of report stuff.
1684200	1690000	Well, anyhow, obviously one big announcement that came out of E3, actually, I want to read
1690000	1691000	a chat comment here.
1691000	1692360	GS191 is correcting me here.
1692360	1697100	Well, actually CNET is actually owned by Ziff Davis, so GameSpot by Proxy is.
1697100	1698100	So interesting.
1698100	1699100	I didn't realize that.
1699100	1700100	All right.
1700100	1701100	Moving on.
1701100	1702100	Oh, sorry.
1702100	1703960	I keep reading chat and I see new stuff pop up.
1703960	1707520	There was a big convention this weekend that might be a little bit near and dear to our
1707520	1710240	hearts and the folks have been listening to us from the beginning.
1710240	1716600	Bolmani Fest was this weekend on the East Coast, which is, of course, this big Bebomani
1716600	1719820	and Beatmania and DDR convention that's on the East Coast.
1719820	1723000	They have it at a bowling alley, hence the term Bolmani, which is cute.
1723000	1726720	And they actually get, usually, some folks that are actually in the games to come out
1726720	1727720	there and perform.
1727720	1728920	That's cute.
1728920	1732720	I wish I was at the East Coast like a couple of weeks later than I was.
1732720	1734200	Maybe I could have gone.
1734200	1735800	Anyhow, big conventions.
1735800	1740400	Last year, one of the big things we saw at E3 was Final Fantasy XIII and, of course,
1740400	1742520	everybody wants to know when.
1742520	1744160	When will we get this game?
1744160	1749520	Well, Square Enix has actually said that they will be doing no games for the PlayStation
1749520	1752820	3 until after April 1st of 2008.
1752820	1754060	Why then?
1754060	1755760	Because that's the new fiscal year.
1755760	1760400	There will be no games from Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 this fiscal year.
1760400	1763160	Not a big surprise as far as Final Fantasy XIII is regarded.
1763160	1767880	I think most of us here in the U.S. were thinking we'd be lucky to see it at the end of 2008
1767880	1770500	with all the translation and stuff that has to go on.
1770500	1771500	But there it is.
1771500	1777360	That's really sad, though, when you think about it because Sony really needs some strong
1777360	1781960	titles to come out in order to be able to push this PlayStation 3 to the level that
1781960	1784760	the 360 and the Wii are right now.
1784760	1789800	We're hoping for Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid IV in both those now or after March
1789800	1792360	of next year.
1792360	1793620	Missed another Christmas.
1793620	1795280	That's not good.
1795280	1797400	That's going to really put them behind.
1797400	1800740	I don't think they're going to be able to catch up.
1800740	1807280	It's going to have to be one of those one in a million shots that's going to turn around.
1807280	1809400	So what's Sony going to push this Christmas?
1809400	1810400	Little Big Planet, Home?
1810400	1811400	The same stuff we saw?
1811400	1812400	Home, Little Big Planet.
1812400	1813400	Killzone?
1813400	1814400	Killzone?
1814400	1815400	I don't know what you're talking about this year.
1815400	1816400	There's no way.
1816400	1817400	I guess that's true.
1817400	1820360	You're probably looking at the second quarter of next year, but I would say this year probably
1820360	1825840	Heavenly Sword because that's pretty much God of War on the PlayStation 3 anyways.
1825840	1830160	Lair is going to be good and probably some unannounced stuff.
1830160	1831160	Ratchet and Clank.
1831160	1832160	The new Ratchet and Clank.
1832160	1833160	It looks awesome.
1833160	1838620	I mean, same people did Resistance and that game was sweet, so I don't know.
1838620	1842080	It's going to be hard for them.
1842080	1846160	Thomas says, we'll see Final Fantasy 13 before Duke Nukem Forever.
1846160	1847160	Very true.
1847160	1848160	Probably.
1848160	1849160	Oh my God.
1849160	1853760	I can't wait for the day when Duke Nukem Forever is actually going to come out.
1853760	1857520	Frisbee calls it Final Fantasy Sporever.
1857520	1858520	Get it?
1858520	1859520	Because Spore is also delayed.
1859520	1862420	It's just been delayed a few years or something.
1862420	1865600	These are all games that people cannot freaking wait for.
1865600	1870840	Well, Spore that we've seen playable in some form, and you know what, it's just a very
1870840	1874880	large game and they have to make sure that it's going to be everything that they want
1874880	1876720	to be before they release it.
1876720	1878800	It's just like Fable 2.
1878800	1879800	It's just like Fable 2.
1879800	1884240	Fable 2 is probably going to be delayed forever because they want to make sure that it's perfect.
1884240	1885240	And you know what?
1885240	1893040	I'd rather them be perfect than have another Transformers game come out or Spiderman 3.
1893040	1898520	One thing that's definitely not been perfect is the brand new firmwares for the PSP.
1898520	1903900	Not one firmware so far released has been able to be not hacked and such is the case
1903900	1906080	with 3.5.
1906080	1916400	In fact, last week they found a new kind of work around called the Illuminati and basically
1916400	1921800	uses the old Luminous to run Homebrew code.
1921800	1927240	And of course, immediately after that came out, there is now a 3.5 down grader so you
1927240	1934320	can down grade your PSP to be able to run either 1.5 so you can run Homebrew that way
1934320	1937840	or to be able to run custom firmwares, which you know, custom firmwares are the way to
1937840	1940000	go I think.
1940000	1946340	Other interesting things though, because of the Illuminati exploit, the Luminous sales
1946340	1950120	have skyrocketed about 14,000%.
1950120	1954060	So a lot of people are picking up Luminous, which you know, it's a great game anyways,
1954060	1957880	but it might be a little harder to find it if you don't have it already.
1957880	1962320	Well, most people were ignoring Luminous 1 because Luminous 2 was out now and I doubt
1962320	1966880	Q Entertainment is making a lot of those, or whoever, who published that one actually?
1966880	1967880	Was it Q?
1967880	1969800	Or was it Sony actually published it?
1969800	1972080	It was Q, but I think Ubisoft published it.
1972080	1973080	Wow, okay.
1973080	1976000	But you know, Ubisoft has been making a lot of copies of that probably because of Luminous
1976000	1977000	2.
1977000	1978000	I don't think it's available anymore.
1978000	1982400	I don't think so either, but people are trying to scrounge them up now.
1982400	1989060	Also on Sony platform's much anticipated Guitar Hero rocks the 80s and they've done a brilliant
1989060	1993760	job over at Activision of keeping this game in the press every week before it's released
1993760	1997760	because they'll give you a few more songs this week, a few more songs, a few more songs.
1997760	2001260	Well finally we know the whole dang song list because we've got some more songs this week
2001260	2002260	and that's it.
2002260	2003960	We've got the whole song list.
2003960	2006200	Caught in a Mosh by Anthrax is in the game.
2006200	2007960	I'm only going to read the songs I care about.
2007960	2010000	Police Truck by the Dead Kennedys.
2010000	2015040	We Got the Beat by the Go-Go's and I love this one, I Think I'm Turning Japanese by
2015040	2016040	the Vapers.
2016040	2017040	Awesome.
2017040	2018040	That's great.
2018040	2019620	That's going to be a great Guitar Hero song.
2019620	2021480	Why are you making Rosalind Face, Rice Princess?
2021480	2022900	Because the song list sucks.
2022900	2023900	You don't like the song list?
2023900	2024900	I don't like it at all.
2024900	2025900	There's some other stuff though that was already announced.
2025900	2026900	I read the whole song list.
2026900	2027900	You read the whole thing?
2027900	2028900	Yeah.
2028900	2029900	I agree.
2029900	2030900	They could have done a little better.
2030900	2031900	What were you hoping for?
2031900	2038080	For like better 80s music that wasn't all just like hair bands and just like crap like
2038080	2039080	that.
2039080	2040080	She's very diverse.
2040080	2041080	Paula Abdul?
2041080	2042080	Yes.
2042080	2043080	But there's no guitar solos there.
2043080	2044080	She's very famous for guitar solos.
2044080	2045080	I know.
2045080	2046080	Then what?
2046080	2047080	I don't know.
2047080	2048080	Hair bands were guitar solos.
2048080	2049080	I don't know.
2049080	2050720	I mean like just something a little more eclectic.
2050720	2056440	I don't have any like, I don't know, examples right now, but I don't know.
2056440	2059280	Raw Steel UT in chat says Guitar Hero 80 sucks.
2059280	2062560	It doesn't have We're Not Gonna Take It or Money for Nothing.
2062560	2063960	Twisted Sister would be pretty awesome.
2063960	2064960	True.
2064960	2065960	Actually Twisted Sister I think is in the band.
2065960	2066960	It's just the wrong song.
2066960	2069600	Let's see.
2069600	2072600	Rama says Guitar Hero needs Weird Al.
2072600	2076040	Frisbee says Elite Beat Agents was going to have Weird Al.
2076040	2077760	That was also a song list that turned out to be fake.
2077760	2081560	I don't know if that was ever actually going to be in the band I think or in the game.
2081560	2083560	I think somebody just kind of pulled that out of their butt.
2083560	2085620	Money for Nothing would be fucking awesome.
2085620	2086620	I agree.
2086620	2087800	That would be cool.
2087800	2089720	Drunami says give us Bohemian Rhapsody.
2089720	2090720	I think that was 70s though.
2090720	2091720	Yeah.
2091720	2092720	It'd be too long.
2092720	2093720	79 or 78.
2093720	2097680	All right, well there you have it, Guitar Hero 80s edition.
2097680	2101480	Those of you guys that do like the air bands, I'm sure you're very excited about that.
2101480	2107440	Anyways, since E3 is right around the corner, not too surprising we're starting to get leaked
2107440	2109820	lists from E3.
2109820	2112200	This course should be of interest to everybody.
2112200	2115200	The Konami E3 list was leaked out.
2115200	2122040	Looks like coming from a tip to Xbox Live Radio or XBL Radio who is another affiliate
2122040	2124160	on AllGames.com just like us.
2124160	2125160	Awesome.
2125160	2131240	Some stuff, of course, not too surprising, DDR Supernova 2 for PlayStation 2, Universe
2131240	2137520	2 for the 360, Karaoke Revolution American Idol 2 for the PlayStation 2, a game called
2137520	2142640	DDR Disney Challenge for the PlayStation 2.
2142640	2145160	Let's see here what else we got.
2145160	2147480	DDR Disney Challenge?
2147480	2149480	Because I thought I read a report somewhere else.
2149480	2153800	I don't know, I was following up with it that said something Disney Channel.
2153800	2155320	It probably is Disney Channel or something.
2155320	2161640	Disney Challenge sounds kind of weird unless it's like all hard stuff, whatever.
2161640	2166360	There's this weird game called Girls Secret Diary for the DS.
2166360	2168880	Record your secrets and dreams in your journal.
2168880	2170600	I can't wait.
2170600	2173600	Is that a game that will finally tear you away from Wow, Girls Secret Diary?
2173600	2174600	Yeah.
2174600	2175600	Oh my God.
2175600	2178920	I don't know why, but that game starts to sound like Ping Pals to me and I get very
2178920	2181640	worried because Ping Pals is shitatious.
2181640	2186080	It should have Girls Secret Diary like RPG or something.
2186080	2190560	I think you're just bitter because it's Girls Secret Diary and that means you can't use
2190560	2191560	it, Rob.
2191560	2196120	And you're like, oh fine, it just sounds like Ping Pals anyway, meh, meh, meh.
2196120	2197120	Shut up.
2197120	2198120	You shut up.
2198120	2199120	Shut your face up.
2199120	2201720	No, I'm totally not going to get that.
2201720	2205760	But you know, I'm sure we'll find out more, me and Avery's like what, just over a week
2205760	2206760	away.
2206760	2207760	Come on, folks.
2207760	2211880	It's around the corner that the PlayStation 2 is going to kind of have their year or two
2211880	2216400	of being the budget system, you know, because it's so cheap and most of the games are probably
2216400	2220960	going to fall to $19.99, $29.99, so like a Disney game on PlayStation 2 kind of makes
2220960	2224840	a lot of sense to me because, you know, who's going to have the PlayStation 2 now is the
2224840	2225840	young kids.
2225840	2226840	Exactly.
2226840	2227840	That's a perfect...
2227840	2229080	Mommy and Daddy are buying systems for us.
2229080	2233080	It's a perfect title for a $29.99 price point.
2233080	2238280	All right, well even though we might be seeing DDR on the PlayStation 2 soon, the PlayStation
2238280	2242360	3 is going to be getting another long time series coming to it.
2242360	2245080	Wipeout Pulse is going to be coming out.
2245080	2249080	Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe has been showing this off for the past few weeks
2249080	2250940	over there in London.
2250940	2257680	Now Wipeout Pulse is going to be a high def version of Wipeout and it's going to be released
2257680	2264640	in 2008, but hopefully we're going to get to see some hints at the game at E3.
2264640	2265640	Whoop-a-dee-doo.
2265640	2267240	I mean, okay, it's high def.
2267240	2273040	If the whole thing was pretty much cel-shaded anyways, I mean, it's not like upping the
2273040	2276840	textures are going to make it any better or anything, but hey, cool.
2276840	2279360	I'm sure it will use the six axis and all that fun stuff.
2279360	2284880	As long as we get some great raving soundtracks like all the other games, that will be great.
2284880	2289040	Pulse' soundtrack is actually pretty cool.
2289040	2291440	Some other interesting stuff coming from the Sony Cam.
2291440	2295360	This one though in India, and unfortunately we're not going to see an advertising campaign
2295360	2298240	like this over here, but oh my God, I wish it was.
2298240	2306120	Apparently, they have a new advertising campaign that is a little bit chauvinistic, I guess.
2306120	2310680	Let me just really quickly read the entire ad.
2310680	2312560	Sherry is such a bitch.
2312560	2317080	Last night, I saw her with this weird guy whom I think she's seen.
2317080	2323640	I mean, she created such a scene when she broke up with Josie, bloody attention seeker.
2323640	2327160	It's not been a week and she's already sleeping around.
2327160	2328160	You know what?
2328160	2331840	I think Nicole is two-timing Ron again.
2331840	2340560	In the very bottom, it says, PlayStation 2, because your girlfriend bores you shitless.
2340560	2341560	That's funny.
2341560	2342560	How do we do that here?
2342560	2343560	That's really funny.
2343560	2346320	People would be pissed off and get offended and stuff.
2346320	2348280	Are you offended as a woman?
2348280	2352600	I'm offended it's not being advertised here because that's one of the best advertisements
2352600	2354560	ever because it's so true.
2354560	2358280	Of course, Sony likes to make the controversial ads.
2358280	2363480	Remember the whole PSP ad, the whole white and black thing that was like, oh my gosh,
2363480	2364480	pushed everybody's butts.
2364480	2365480	I love this one.
2365480	2366480	It shows this guy.
2366480	2377520	It looks like he's from Schoolhouse Rocks and he's just sitting there slouching like
2377520	2381040	I don't give a shit while his girlfriend's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.
2381040	2383040	So that was kind of funny.
2383040	2386560	Ross Steele, UT in chat, says, and then we wonder why women don't play video games.
2386560	2391720	Yes, that's the only reason why because gaming companies make offensive advertisement.
2391720	2395680	Most women I know would see the offensive advertisement and then go, well, if they're
2395680	2397880	going to be like that, then I'm going to play lots of video games.
2397880	2398880	I'll show them.
2398880	2399880	I don't have to be boring.
2399880	2401880	Well, it could be like, you know.
2401880	2405160	Then they'll realize how terrible they are at video games and then they'll stop.
2405160	2408360	PlayStation 2, if your boyfriend can't satisfy you, rez will.
2408360	2415160	I mean, there's a great ad campaign as well.
2415160	2420200	I can't wait to see the ad campaigns for Soul Calibur IV, especially, you know, being that
2420200	2427160	the IVs, IVs, slutatious boobs are being shown off in the trailer massive side boob
2427160	2428160	in those pictures.
2428160	2433180	There is massive side boob in those pictures and a massive bombshell drop this week in
2433180	2434560	regards to Soul Calibur IV.
2434560	2440360	First, the game is coming out next year on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and, you know,
2440360	2441640	Tekken is online now.
2441640	2445540	So Hello Namco, is Soul Calibur IV going to be online?
2445540	2448240	And the answer is yes.
2448240	2450560	And that quote comes from Namco.
2450560	2456240	It says, quote, with the current environment, we really couldn't make Soul Calibur IV without
2456240	2457520	online play.
2457520	2464720	That's from the director, Katsutoshi Sasaki, who makes Soul Calibur IV.
2464720	2467860	So that's exciting because I know a lot of folks like to play their online games.
2467860	2470400	Hopefully there is not some crappy lag.
2470400	2474720	That would be bad because crappy lag always ruins those online fighting games.
2474720	2478080	But I actually remember reading some other unrelated story this week that talked about
2478080	2482720	like a lag-free system for fighting games that have been developed that's supposed to
2482720	2485800	like eliminate practically all the lag that you see in fighting games.
2485800	2490060	I don't know how well it works, but maybe Soul Calibur IV will be able to implement
2490060	2491060	some of this technology.
2491060	2492060	Who knows?
2492060	2495400	I think it's a myth, kind of like those cars that run on air or something like that, you
2495400	2501360	know, the magical cars that, you know, zero emissions and, you know, fuel would be plentiful
2501360	2504560	and it's all a myth.
2504560	2509800	What's interesting though, this announcement just came out recently.
2509800	2516600	Apparently the Bourne conspiracy is going to be coming to Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
2516600	2523080	Now it is based on the Jason Bourne character from the book series and not necessarily from
2523080	2525280	the movie series even though the Bourne...
2525280	2526280	So Matt Damon?
2526280	2527280	No, Matt Damon.
2527280	2531320	So, you know, same character, you know, not based on the movie though.
2531320	2533360	It is due out summer 2008.
2533360	2537600	It's going to be developed by High Moon Studios, which you might remember they did a game a
2537600	2542560	couple years back called Darkwatch, a vampire western game.
2542560	2546480	It looks pretty cool though so far, but still a ways away.
2546480	2550740	Maybe some more details will be coming out from E3, so.
2550740	2553480	We're getting some feedback on the last story because, you know, sometimes there's a little
2553480	2556080	bit of lag here between chat and what we're taping live.
2556080	2558480	Of course chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
2558480	2562600	Toshan is in chat and says this is not a myth, the whole lag-free fighting thing we're talking
2562600	2563600	about.
2563600	2568000	He says, my friend made it, FYI, ggpo.net.
2568000	2569800	Interesting.
2569800	2570800	I guess we'll see.
2570800	2572680	Let's see how well it's implemented.
2572680	2577160	I haven't seen any videos of it in action yet or gotten to use it myself, but the prospects
2577160	2578160	of it sound very exciting.
2578160	2580160	Don't get me wrong.
2580160	2584720	Moving on to another title that's having another version coming out.
2584720	2590720	TimeSplitters 4 is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3.
2590720	2594840	TimeSplitters kind of seems to, it's not a game you hear about a lot, but a lot of folks
2594840	2596800	that have played this game seem to really enjoy it.
2596800	2598440	You're a TimeSplitters fan, aren't you, Loki?
2598440	2603400	I love TimeSplitters, I cannot wait for this.
2603400	2607800	TimeSplitters is probably hands down one of the best first person shooter games out there,
2607800	2611520	especially TimeSplitters 2, which is, it's fun.
2611520	2612520	That's it.
2612520	2618000	The whole game focuses on multiplayer deathmatches and create your own levels and weird mini
2618000	2623400	games and stuff like you can race a cat in the third one.
2623400	2625280	It's just an awesome game.
2625280	2628480	By the way, if you're skeptical, this was confirmed in the latest edition of the official
2628480	2633120	Playstation Magazine in the UK, obviously the US one is not around anymore.
2633120	2637200	The forum post that originally tipped people off to this also says about the article, there's
2637200	2641420	no actual news on the features other than Steve Ellis says, quote, they're gearing up
2641420	2644520	to insert monkeys and guns into all the wrong places.
2644520	2645520	Awesome.
2645520	2648560	Yeah, that game had lots of monkeys.
2648560	2652440	I'll make Loki very happy.
2652440	2656880	Some other interesting stuff, a lot of people have been, of course, overclocking their PSPs
2656880	2663040	with the home brew scene, especially with the custom firmwares out there.
2663040	2669560	Although, one of the things that people found out is with the new version 3.5 firmware,
2669560	2679640	I believe, they actually can tap the full speed of the system, which is about 50% faster.
2679640	2684480	The first game that's going to be doing this, though, is God of War Chains of Olympus.
2684480	2688640	It's going to be running at the full speed on there because obviously the game's going
2688640	2692800	to be quite graphically intensive.
2692800	2697600	Interesting to see that they're actually finally kind of say, fuck battery life, we're just
2697600	2703080	going to use the full speed of the system.
2703080	2707840	Why is it that folks don't want to use the full speed of the system normally?
2707840	2709480	I don't understand the way that works.
2709480	2713040	Originally, it's because it cut down on battery life, so they couldn't advertise
2713040	2715680	that the battery lasts X amount of time.
2715680	2717600	Originally, they could run it at the full speed.
2717600	2723600	In fact, you can overclock yours to run at 333 megahertz instead of 222.
2723600	2728640	In fact, that's what we do for playing Grand Theft Auto, so it's smoother, less load
2728640	2732120	time, but I don't know.
2732120	2736920	It's just their choice, I guess, they don't want to do it.
2736920	2739880	Well our chat room, of course, we're a little bit behind apparently because they're still
2739880	2745520	reacting to the last story and they're talking about the racing cats and act-def says, we
2745520	2751720	don't want monkeys, we want laser cats because remember we talked about laser cats, the game
2751720	2760360	and how somebody badly needs to make that, and then the chat room says that they actually
2760360	2762920	want rap cats.
2762920	2768060	Kill me now.
2768060	2772140	There was some other interesting music that came out a little bit later on, also this
2772140	2779120	whole hacking the Fermars and stuff, they found that 3.5 and 3.51 have an official ISO
2779120	2787680	loader, so Sony is actually going to be enabling you to run games off the memory sticks.
2787680	2791180	So they're going to either have a way to dump games to the memory stick or you're going
2791180	2794520	to have a new download service where you're going to be able to download games to run
2794520	2797880	straight off the memory stick, even though they kind of do that with demos right now,
2797880	2803640	but it is an official ISO loader which apparently is going to be included in the next home brew
2803640	2805840	firmware that's going to be made.
2805840	2806840	The plot thickens.
2806840	2810600	All right, well anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.
2810600	2815080	Even though Dark Soccer isn't here this week, we're going to sneak behind her back and open
2815080	2817240	up the emailbag because we can't wait.
2817240	2820360	We're like kids on Christmas Eve, we can't wait to open up our presents and when you
2820360	2824840	guys send us emails every week at mailbag at orangehonestradio.com, they are like little
2824840	2825840	presents.
2825840	2830000	So let's open up the mailbag.
2830000	2836080	All right, not a whole lot of emails this week, I think because a lot of folks actually
2836080	2840720	got to call into the show last week and kind of say their piece, however, we do have some
2840720	2841720	emails.
2841720	2842720	I want to start with this.
2842720	2843720	This is from Dark Mutts.
2843720	2848240	Hey guys and gal, I have been listening to you for about six months and I found your
2848240	2852160	podcast to be the only one that is consistent and always entertaining.
2852160	2853160	Thank you.
2853160	2858400	I have to thank Loki because without his clever insight about what makes a game fun, I never
2858400	2861760	would have found Earth Defense Force 2017.
2861760	2864040	I have been addicted since I acquired it.
2864040	2865840	Congrats on five years and keep it coming.
2865840	2869880	The three of you keep me going through my work day without having to light anyone on
2869880	2870880	fire.
2870880	2872840	Thanks again, Dark Mutts.
2872840	2873840	Very cool.
2873840	2877400	Isn't that a weird feeling when somebody says like, because video games aren't cheap, so
2877400	2881840	like somebody says like based on your word, I spent $50 of my hard-earned money for my
2881840	2883640	day job that drives me insane to buy this game.
2883640	2888360	At least it's only a $40 game so that doesn't, you know, it knows like still, but still,
2888360	2889360	I know, I know.
2889360	2891880	So what makes a game fun for you, Loki?
2891880	2893480	It's just, it's got to be fun.
2893480	2897840	I mean, you know, Earth Defense Force is one of those games, I'm still playing it.
2897840	2901520	It's because, you know, you know what you're getting into when you play it.
2901520	2905860	It's cheesy and weird, but you can really ramp up the difficulty in it and it gives
2905860	2910720	you something to kind of achieve for, you know, collecting the different weapons used
2910720	2914520	in the game and trying to beat each level, you know, on different difficulties.
2914520	2916240	It's a lot of teamwork involved.
2916240	2917240	I don't know.
2917240	2920840	It's just, it's hard to really pinpoint what makes a game great, but you know, Time
2920840	2927280	Splitters 2 was another one or even Time Splitters 3 had really a lot of, you know, stuff to
2927280	2928280	do in it.
2928280	2929280	You can play the story modes.
2929280	2932800	They have a bunch of like mini games to try out and the mini games get pretty hard.
2932800	2935680	Like they have, I remember the original Time Splitters, you have to break windows with
2935680	2940320	bricks and that sounds easy, but you have a time limit and you have to do that and it
2940320	2941840	gets pretty hard.
2941840	2943400	So I don't know.
2943400	2945220	It's a cool game.
2945220	2946920	Lots of blah, blah, blahs in chat right now.
2946920	2947920	Let me read some of these.
2947920	2951360	Solid Goomba says, I bought Earth Defense Force after hearing Loki rave about it.
2951360	2952360	So that's another person.
2952360	2954480	Boy, that company should be sending you a check.
2954480	2955480	Hey, D3's awesome.
2955480	2961480	I've been playing, what is it, Work Time Fun right now and that game is so stupid and
2961480	2963040	awful but I can't stop playing it.
2963040	2964040	I don't know why.
2964040	2967320	JV Mon says, Loki is the king of OLR and Rob is his puppet.
2967320	2969320	There you go.
2969320	2972660	RosteelUT, who I've been quoting a lot tonight, I guess I like the cynics tonight because
2972660	2977220	RosteelUT is kind of our in-house cynic, says, Loki, very fucking insightful.
2977220	2978220	What makes a game fun?
2978220	2980440	Um, the game's fun?
2980440	2981840	I don't know what makes it fun.
2981840	2983840	Ew, what a cunty bitch, man.
2983840	2988760	That's what he says to everyone apparently.
2988760	2992580	It's basically lots of stuff to do in the game, like a lot of options for you.
2992580	2993580	It's whatever you enjoy.
2993580	2994580	It's the game play.
2994580	2996020	You like blowing shit up.
2996020	2997280	I like blowing stuff up.
2997280	3002480	I like writing boobs in places I shouldn't be able to and naming things.
3002480	3006320	Everybody finds something different to be fun usually, right?
3006320	3007760	It doesn't matter what I find fun.
3007760	3008840	It's whatever you find fun.
3008840	3014240	If you don't want to trust my judgment with buying a game, you can always go rent it.
3014240	3017720	That's a lot cheaper and I'm sure a lot of the mom and pop shops out there would really
3017720	3018840	appreciate that from you.
3018840	3024000	Dark Tetsuya says, tonight's OLR has been brought to you by D3 and by GameTap.
3024000	3027680	I neglected to say I played GameTap during my gaming week because I just needed to leave
3027680	3030960	it out for once, all right, because I knew there was going to be that fucking comment
3030960	3033960	at some point.
3033960	3037920	I'm not on D3 payroll, that's for sure, but at least they have the balls to bring over
3037920	3043120	games that might not necessarily work over here, like Earth Defense Force and they have
3043120	3048260	that one that's coming out at one point, the 360 where you're like some chick in lingerie
3048260	3051760	with a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword.
3051760	3054680	That might not necessarily do well over here, but at least they're going to give it a shot.
3054680	3055960	What the fuck are you talking about?
3055960	3056960	That sounds awesome.
3056960	3058160	That's the name of the game.
3058160	3059160	I don't remember what it's called.
3059160	3062320	It's got some long Japanese name and I'm not even going to attempt to remember what it
3062320	3065600	was.
3065600	3070120	Act Deaf says Pac-Man Championship Edition is fun, yet Loki doesn't see that.
3070120	3073040	I think Pac-Man Championship Edition is a hell of a lot of fun.
3073040	3077760	It's way more fast paced than the old one, which I think is awesome, the Ray-Far music
3077760	3078760	and everything.
3078760	3080480	I'm just not a fan of Pac-Man that much.
3080480	3086360	I love the really, really retro classics and updates and that stuff, like the old school
3086360	3087360	arcade game.
3087360	3089760	It's just like I'm playing Zelda II now for some reason and I don't know why.
3089760	3090760	Zelda II?
3090760	3091760	Yeah.
3091760	3092760	It's like a great game.
3092760	3093760	Not really.
3093760	3094760	Yes, it is.
3094760	3095760	It's like a great game.
3095760	3096760	I like it too.
3096760	3097760	I think it's great.
3097760	3098760	I think I need to buy that on the Wii.
3098760	3099760	You totally do.
3099760	3100760	Anyway, what else was I going to say?
3100760	3105040	Any other fun factor games that people are overlooking right now?
3105040	3107440	I think about Katamari Damacy.
3107440	3108720	What sold that game?
3108720	3111400	The fun factor and the fact that it was a low price.
3111400	3116360	The game itself wasn't exactly graphically the most impressive.
3116360	3119960	You would ask people what draws you to Katamari Damacy and people just go, it's fucking fun
3119960	3120960	to roll over shit.
3120960	3125760	Then, of course, you have your cynics who just want everybody to say, that game sucks.
3125760	3127160	You know they're welcome to that opinion.
3127160	3132200	I would recommend it and this would be pretty hard to find nowadays, but if you can, find
3132200	3133200	it.
3133200	3137280	I don't recommend buying it, but if you can rent it, Driver 3.
3137280	3142200	I know, I know, it's such a horrible game, but it's really a game that you need to play
3142200	3146300	because you're just like, oh my God, I can't believe it's really this bad.
3146300	3148020	It's entertaining in that aspect.
3148020	3152680	My sister is buying my Playstation 2 and we have that game dumped on the hard drive so
3152680	3157040	she can play it and I swear to God, she plays this thing more than anything else on that
3157040	3158040	damn system.
3158040	3162960	They will sit there for hours recording instant replays and watching the AI get all fucked
3162960	3163960	up.
3163960	3166200	Driver 3 is the show girls of gaming.
3166200	3169920	It's so bad, it's pretty good.
3169920	3174840	There's a lot of games out there that are really hard to, a lot of people overlook that
3174840	3175840	are fun.
3175840	3178200	You just really have to play a lot of the stuff.
3178200	3180040	Saints Row is another one that I love.
3180040	3181040	New email.
3181040	3184680	Oh man, Saints Row, the musical, that was so funny.
3184680	3186040	Only three emails tonight.
3186040	3191880	Here's the second one and this is from the doctor and says, alright, this is my first
3191880	3192880	email to the mailbag.
3192880	3193880	I'm so nervous.
3193880	3195840	Okay, first question is for DarkSakura.
3195840	3201880	How many Pokemon do you own in your game because I own 354 because I have no life whatsoever
3201880	3205920	now that school is over for me and could we possibly battle sometime?
3205920	3208840	Unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here, she can't answer your question.
3208840	3210440	Maybe she'll read up your email earlier.
3210440	3215160	I don't think she's super duper far into the game, so she probably has less than 50, but
3215160	3216160	that's speculation.
3216160	3217160	I don't know for sure.
3217160	3221360	But if you want to battle with DarkSakura, urge her to leave her friend code in our forums
3221360	3225960	because we actually have a forum post for Pokemon friend codes.
3225960	3227800	Moving on back to the doctor's email.
3227800	3228800	Second is for Skye.
3228800	3229800	I heart you.
3229800	3230840	Aw, thank you.
3230840	3235640	And could you say, excuse me DarkSakura, again, please, please, please.
3235640	3237280	I'll see what I can do.
3237280	3238280	Third is for Loki.
3238280	3240680	Okay, I got nothing, sorry, oh wait.
3240680	3243900	How good were you at DDR before you stopped?
3243900	3248740	Because I go to the golf and stuff nearest me and play Supernova when I get some extra
3248740	3251380	money to spend and how the fuck do you manage crossovers?
3251380	3253160	They piss me off.
3253160	3260760	I used to play a lot of doubles actually at one time and I used to do a lot of the Katas
3260760	3265080	because I could never pass max or anything like that on doubles.
3265080	3267600	It's just too fast.
3267600	3270620	You get to the point there, especially when you're running back and forth on some of those
3270620	3275720	doubles things, if there's any amount of dust on there, you're going to fall on your ass.
3275720	3279960	Really I'd never try to do that stuff, but I did play some really hard edits.
3279960	3285640	I used to do edits a lot and really they can be as hard as you want to make them, I guess.
3285640	3288320	There was, oh my God, and I don't remember the guy.
3288320	3293880	There's this one Japanese guy that had a website with edits on there and they were the fucking
3293880	3294880	shit.
3294880	3298200	I don't remember who the guy is now because I haven't been playing edits for a long time,
3298200	3299760	but I don't know.
3299760	3306880	If you look for some DDR edit websites, this guy is just amazing and he had a bunch of
3306880	3311920	Ask URS sites, so I wish I could be more helpful there, but some great stuff.
3311920	3320840	They had one for, it was called Swingman, that was on the Jazz and it was an awesome
3320840	3321840	edit.
3321840	3324600	It had this real flow to it that was really cool.
3324600	3330560	One last question from the doctor, when did Squaresoft become Square Enix and why?
3330560	3333920	Or as we call them here on the show, Squeenix.
3333920	3335940	When did Square Enix become and why?
3335940	3337080	It was what, about three years ago?
3337080	3338160	Two or three years ago.
3338160	3343000	They bought Enix, which had made a bunch of games, Dragon Quest is probably their most
3343000	3349200	popular series of games, which you may know as Dragon Warrior, years ago it was called.
3349200	3350600	What else did they make?
3350600	3356280	I know on Super Nintendo they were very popular for Brain Lord and Illusion of Gaia and those
3356280	3357280	games.
3357280	3361700	Then later on, I also know for music game fans, they were the folks that made Bust A
3361700	3362700	Move.
3362700	3365440	Did they do the Tow Ball series or was that Square?
3365440	3366920	I don't know off the top of my head.
3366920	3368720	I'm sure someone in the chat knows.
3368720	3369720	So there you go.
3369720	3374820	Yeah, that's what happened, that was a few years ago and a lot of people were very afraid
3374820	3377520	when that merge first happened, but it actually hasn't been too bad.
3377520	3380800	In fact, a lot of good stuff has come out of that company, it's hard to complain.
3380800	3381960	So there you go.
3381960	3385280	And just for you, the doctor, I dug this up for you.
3385280	3390760	Well excuse me, Dark Sakura.
3390760	3396880	Now don't tell her I played that or I'm going to fucking get beat up when she comes back.
3396880	3399200	I don't think she was too happy with that.
3399200	3400200	Why?
3400200	3402360	I know, I think it's funny.
3402360	3403360	It's brilliant.
3403360	3406720	I think it's because I called her Dark Sakura and she doesn't like that.
3406720	3409680	Well excuse me.
3409680	3413360	Then there was another one, remember the Rob D made these, he made another one.
3413360	3420720	Well excuse me again, Dark Sakura.
3420720	3422400	I'm so going to get beat up.
3422400	3424880	Love you Jamie, wherever you are.
3424880	3428000	Anyhow, one more email.
3428000	3433440	And this one wasn't signed, so I don't really know who to say who this is from.
3433440	3437080	I don't even know if I want to read the, it's Ikuma is in the header, so we'll just say
3437080	3438080	it's from them.
3438080	3439720	It says, hi there.
3439720	3443440	I have been listening for one and a half year and just want to take this opportunity to
3443440	3445040	wish you guys happy fifth.
3445040	3449560	I am a developer in Japan and yes, Rob had once mentioned our game in the new release
3449560	3450560	section.
3450560	3453120	We all just love it when Rob reads in Japanese.
3453120	3455040	And then there's a cute little face there.
3455040	3457960	And who says no love from developer?
3457960	3462040	Hope you guys would be part of my Friday for another five years to come.
3462040	3466280	So unfortunately this person didn't say who they are, what developer they're talking about
3466280	3467600	or any of that stuff, just that.
3467600	3471320	I have horribly butchered the name of one of their games on the program in the past.
3471320	3472320	That's love though.
3472320	3473320	That's awesome.
3473320	3474320	That's awesome.
3474320	3475320	That's awesome.
3475320	3476520	Thank you so much for the email.
3476520	3480640	Tell us who you are because we'd love to have more developers on the show, especially ones
3480640	3483520	that are crazy enough to listen to this.
3483520	3485760	We'd also love to be invited to Tokyo Game Show.
3485760	3487640	That's a very good point.
3487640	3493040	If you would like some coverage of Tokyo Game Show from us, please email us and let us know.
3493040	3494040	That's awesome.
3494040	3499240	Dark Tetsuya asks, was it the developer of Dust Cap Extreme 2 Collector's Edition?
3499240	3503360	Probably one of your hamster love games or something.
3503360	3504360	God, I hope so.
3504360	3505360	God, I hope so.
3505360	3506360	Oh my God.
3506360	3507360	Oh my God.
3507360	3510400	Please tell me you guys develop one of those hamster games.
3510400	3513120	There's another one of those hamster games coming out over here.
3513120	3515120	There's a couple of hamster games coming out over here.
3515120	3518080	I think Hamster Life 2 is coming out over here now.
3518080	3519560	Those Ubisoft games.
3519560	3520980	All right.
3520980	3521980	That was the last email.
3521980	3522980	I'm going to close up the old mailbag.
3522980	3525520	That comes with a we because I would totally buy that game.
3525520	3527800	God, that made me so happy when I read that email.
3527800	3528800	I was like, oh good.
3528800	3532880	They're not getting all pissed off that I'm butchering their releases.
3532880	3533880	Funny American.
3533880	3536160	It's stupid, Matt.
3536160	3537160	All right.
3537160	3538160	Back to the gaming news.
3538160	3540600	If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelauncherdo.com.
3540600	3545360	If you're from an American, Canadian, Antarctican developer, who cares?
3545360	3549240	Email us and tell us you're listening because we love to hear that folks in the industry
3549240	3550240	are listening.
3550240	3553640	Dude, totally need to meet up at the arcade in Antarctica to play some DDR.
3553640	3555960	Shut up and get to the next story.
3555960	3563960	Anyways, Civilization is coming to consoles and handhelds soon being brought over by 2K
3563960	3569160	Games and developed by Fireaxis Games, Civilization Revolution.
3569160	3575240	It's going to include 16 civilizations to master and lead to victory and of course famous
3575240	3578680	historical leaders, yada, yada, yada.
3578680	3583400	Online multiplayer as well is going to be in it.
3583400	3584400	Pretty cool.
3584400	3588520	I'm not a huge Civilization fan, but it sounds interesting.
3588520	3593160	I'm a fucking huge Civilization fan, at least the old school ones, and I don't know how
3593160	3594160	to approach this.
3594160	3595160	I'm a little worried.
3595160	3598680	Well, okay, first off, this is not the first time we've had Civilization on a console.
3598680	3602880	The original Civilization was on Super Nintendo and there was a version of Civilization II
3602880	3606360	I played on the N-Gage of all things, the E3 a couple years ago, and it made me want
3606360	3611680	to cry and stab myself with the blunt N-Gage.
3611680	3612680	These are what?
3612680	3614520	Spin-off games or are these direct ports?
3614520	3615980	I think this is a spin-off series.
3615980	3620520	When I read it, it sounded like a spin-off series, which can go who knows any which way.
3620520	3625200	God, then that makes me worry, is this going to turn out like the Mortal Kombat anthology
3625200	3626200	stories or whatever?
3626200	3628520	Remember the Sub-Zero game?
3628520	3631640	I don't think it's anything like that, but I hope not.
3631640	3635360	It's probably going to be maybe a little bit more scaled down for consoles.
3635360	3636400	I don't know.
3636400	3637400	It sounds okay.
3637400	3640920	Well, do you really need to scale down for consoles?
3640920	3646740	I just could not see the full game itself on an Xbox 360, and the biggest reason why
3646740	3650480	is that there's no mouse and those thumb sticks don't cut it.
3650480	3654040	Some games were meant to be played with a mouse, and that's all there is to it.
3654040	3658720	I don't understand why they just don't have keyboard and mouse support, since it has fucking
3658720	3659720	USB ports.
3659720	3669620	In fact, all of the next-gen platforms have USB ports that can put a keyboard and mouse
3669620	3670620	on there.
3670620	3673760	Except for maybe the Wii, that'd be kind of stupid because you have the Wii Remote,
3673760	3678400	but still though, if you really want to and if they really would decide to support it,
3678400	3681440	they could put a keyboard and mouse on there.
3681440	3687600	Another very popular PC gaming series is Guild Wars, and IGN had an interview this week on
3687600	3692460	their PC site about Guild Wars 2 and the Eye of the North expansion for Guild Wars.
3692460	3694160	You played Guild Wars for a little bit, right?
3694160	3695160	I totally did.
3695160	3696160	And what'd you think?
3696160	3700520	I actually liked it until it got to level 20, and then it was just like, oh.
3700520	3703760	Well maybe there's something in the Eye of the North for you, because Eye of the North,
3703760	3706360	I was kind of reading through the interview here, and if you want to read the full thing,
3706360	3709500	head over to PC.IGN.com and you can read the full thing.
3709500	3711720	What I didn't know, because I didn't know a lot about these games before I was reading
3711720	3716600	the interview, and Eye of the North is actually the first Guild Wars expansion that requires
3716600	3719080	one of the other expansions to play.
3719080	3723600	And the reason for that is that all of the content they put into this, they put 18 new
3723600	3727200	dungeons and they're all for endgame characters.
3727200	3731880	So whereas with any of the other expansions, you can buy them by themselves and create
3731880	3734120	a character from the ground up.
3734120	3738920	But for this one, they didn't waste any time making a level one through 20 story.
3738920	3744480	It's all hardcore endgame content, which I think is kind of interesting about that.
3744480	3748840	And then I kind of went to talking about how they're actually developing the game, and
3748840	3752000	did they actually split into two different development teams?
3752000	3756200	And yes, there's a development team for Guild Wars 2 right now, but then the Eye of the
3756200	3759320	North people will come over when Guild Wars 2 is done.
3759320	3764320	And they admit that most of the resources are being focused on the Guild Wars expansion,
3764320	3767700	but then they're going to all shift over to Guild Wars 2 once the expansion is done.
3767700	3771720	So this definitely sounds like it's going to be the last Guild Wars expansion.
3771720	3776120	And they actually say that they do kind of tend to monitor the trends in the PVP, like
3776120	3782240	meta games that people come up with, and then they kind of like figure out, use those ideas
3782240	3784200	for like live events and holiday events.
3784200	3788440	And then they claim them for themselves, they're like, that was my idea!
3788440	3789440	Wait a minute!
3789440	3795440	No, they just sound like they're really tied down to the community, which I think is great.
3795440	3798920	So there you go, some exciting news for Guild Wars fans.
3798920	3799920	Awesome.
3799920	3808760	Anyways, so we've got some interesting stuff, I guess, making its way out to the US.
3808760	3816120	Not a whole lot though, this week's kind of dead, as most of July usually is.
3816120	3820480	Pretty much this week though, the only things you've got are Ninja Game Sigma for Playstation
3820480	3827020	3, and Vampire Rain on the Xbox 360.
3827020	3829120	That is about it.
3829120	3835080	PC games, there's a bunch of weird stuff coming out, including, let's see, well actually Marvel
3835080	3842920	Trading Card games coming out on PC, Title Legends 2 is coming out on PC, Ride!
3842920	3847520	Carnival Tycoon, I swear to God, every fucking week there's a goddamn Tycoon game coming
3847520	3848920	out.
3848920	3858160	DS, Platinum Sudoku, and Vegas Casino High Five, making its way out.
3858160	3860040	So that is it.
3860040	3864720	Alright, let's head on over to the Japanese release dates and check out what's going on
3864720	3866340	in Japan.
3866340	3868280	Is Chicken Shoot coming out this week?
3868280	3869880	Chicken Shoot came out last week too.
3869880	3871000	Oh my God, did it really?
3871000	3872000	I guess.
3872000	3873000	No, Chicken Shoot's great.
3873000	3877520	Sorry, because it was on the list over here, but as a US release, so I just wanted to kind
3877520	3878520	of question that.
3878520	3880900	It doesn't look like there's actually a whole lot coming out in Japan as well, though there
3880900	3885160	are a couple games coming out on the Playstation 3, Blazing Angels, Squadrons of World War
3885160	3890280	2 for the Playstation 3, Boku no Natsu Yasu-oh God, I just butchered that one.
3890280	3895680	Boku no Natsu Yasumi 3 is coming out over in Japan as well, and that was like a bug
3895680	3896680	catching game.
3896680	3900400	Wait, I didn't hear that Rob, can you say that again?
3900400	3903960	Boku no Natsu Yasumi 3 is coming out.
3903960	3905480	See the more I practice, the better I get.
3905480	3907000	It's a bug catching game.
3907000	3908640	Why don't we get anything like that over here?
3908640	3910320	Doesn't that look cute?
3910320	3912640	Maybe that's what Africa is going to actually be all about.
3912640	3913640	Africa?
3913640	3914640	Poaching animals?
3914640	3915640	Yes, you poach animals.
3915640	3917800	That would be fun.
3917800	3921520	I'm assuming that because I see the little guy on the cover of the game is holding a
3921520	3925200	little bug net and little like, you know, thing that you keep bugs in.
3925200	3929660	Anyway, let's see if there's anything else coming out on some of the other platforms
3929660	3931160	that you might be looking forward to.
3931160	3932160	What?
3932160	3936640	It's really crazy kid with bug net murders family.
3936640	3941780	PlayStation 2, some stuff really just moving into the best hits like Winning Post 7, Ape
3941780	3946720	Escape 3, and Ratchet and Clank 4 is all moving into the best.
3946720	3951320	Not a lot of new stuff coming out otherwise, but some price reductions there.
3951320	3955080	Coming out on the Nintendo DS though, you have some stuff coming out.
3955080	3958280	Chibi-Robo Park Patrol is coming out.
3958280	3965760	Yoku Demo Yoga coming out on the DS, and let's see what else we have here, Kururin Donuts
3965760	3968040	Okashi Recipe.
3968040	3973560	I have no idea what that is, but it's got a happy donut on the cover and it's an action
3973560	3976960	game, so it kind of makes it look like it might be a racing game involving donuts.
3976960	3977960	I have no fucking idea.
3977960	3979200	Happy donut action game.
3979200	3981680	Yeah, but who wouldn't want to buy a happy donut action game?
3981680	3982680	I don't know.
3982680	3984120	I'd buy a happy donut action game.
3984120	3985120	Me too.
3985120	3986120	Poochie Poochie Virus.
3986120	3991520	It sounds fascinating and is also coming out on the DS.
3991520	3997280	It's also another action game with a cast of very chibi looking characters there also
3997280	3998760	coming to Japan.
3998760	4005680	Quickly looking to see if there's anything on the PSP this week in Japan.
4005680	4010840	Just like just some games going into the best hits, including Rengoku 2, The Stairway to
4010840	4012280	Heaven moving into the best hits.
4012280	4014680	Or Hell, depending on how you look at it.
4014680	4020880	All right, going over to the European release dates, Dark Sakura, sadly not here this week,
4020880	4026080	but on July 6th, those of you over in Europe can look forward to The King of Fighters,
4026080	4030340	Maximum Impact 2, and The King of Fighters 11 on the PlayStation 2, as well as the Metal
4030340	4034160	Slug Anthology coming out on the PlayStation 2.
4034160	4035160	That's really it.
4035160	4037800	It's a very slow week for those of you guys in Europe.
4037800	4041280	All right, that does it for release dates.
4041280	4049920	Well, it may be a little too soon, but the VTech report covering what happened with the
4049920	4056760	shootings at Virginia Tech, apparently there's no mention of the video game issue, despite
4056760	4064000	the fact that everybody was saying, hey, video games made him kill people, dah, dah, dah.
4064000	4070000	That's interesting, but apparently the PAC though, they've denounced the report saying
4070000	4075160	that it's a cover-up, and they're claiming that really it was video games to blame, and
4075160	4076480	it's this giant cover-up.
4076480	4078480	Oh, shut up.
4078480	4079760	Seriously.
4079760	4081760	Shut the hell up, people.
4081760	4086280	Why do people want to blame video games for everything?
4086280	4087280	I don't know.
4087280	4094680	It's just people want to focus on whatever their agenda is, and if they really want to
4094680	4099440	get rid of video games, or censor them to death, just like they did with rap music and
4099440	4104240	stuff before, they're going to make any excuses, oh, it's going to make you infertile if you
4104240	4108400	play video games, oh, it's kill my baby, stuff like that.
4108400	4112880	So pretty soon they'll be just like, oh, if you don't have Jesus in your life, you're
4112880	4114520	going to go kill people.
4114520	4118600	It's crazy shit.
4118600	4123400	Chat room, chat.orangehonestready.com, live on Sunday nights, Solid Goomba says, didn't
4123400	4125720	they search his room and not even find a single console?
4125720	4127600	I seem to remember that to be the case.
4127600	4131600	Exactly, just because he participates in a goddamn extracurricular activity, which includes
4131600	4138400	playing a computer game, oh my God, that doesn't mean that he's trained on that computer game
4138400	4143760	to be a killer, and I'm sorry, but there is no way on the face of the earth to train on
4143760	4146500	a PC game to become a killer.
4146500	4153260	I think for some sad whatever reason, people have the need to blame something, and obviously
4153260	4159560	what happened at Virginia Tech was just absolutely tremendously horrible, and a lot of us had
4159560	4162960	that reaction of how could something like this happen?
4162960	4167360	How fucked up is this world that some kid would do this to their peers?
4167360	4171180	So I think out of that desperation, people look for something to blame, and video games
4171180	4178320	unfortunately are an easy target because they allow you to pretend that you are someone
4178320	4180380	else, and unfortunately not everybody can see that line.
4180380	4183720	I don't even know why this was an issue when they didn't even have any sort of evidence
4183720	4188160	in the beginning that video games were even involved in any way, but immediately they're
4188160	4194480	saying, oh, it must be this, it's Doom, it's Marilyn Manson, it's MTV, it's all this that
4194480	4196800	did this.
4196800	4198080	Take responsibility, people.
4198080	4205000	It was a crazy, crazy, crazy person that probably, I don't know, I don't even want to speculate
4205000	4210200	because I'll say something that will be foot and mouth syndrome, but it was a very unfortunate
4210200	4211960	thing, period.
4211960	4214640	I blame World War II.
4214640	4216640	That's what I blame.
4216640	4220920	It's all those World War II documentaries out there that show the kamikazes.
4220920	4221920	That's what I blame.
4221920	4225840	I blame the Atari 2600, don't you?
4225840	4226840	I do.
4226840	4229120	I mean, they had the man bomber after all in there.
4229120	4235600	Well, the Atari 2600 is getting the flashback portable, at least it's a little prototype
4235600	4237120	that's been made.
4237120	4240720	Kurt Vendell, who actually made the original Atari flashback, is now trying to make an
4240720	4243840	Atari flashback portable, and the thing's tiny.
4243840	4247240	I mean, it's almost the size of the old Atari cartridge.
4247240	4251160	So if you've ever wanted to play your favorite 2600 games on the go, that could actually
4251160	4253120	be on the way.
4253120	4257960	The unit is supposed to run off three AAA batteries with a 15-hour run time, I mean,
4257960	4263000	it is an Atari 2600 after all, and there's going to be a USB port on it, so that way
4263000	4265880	you can actually load games from the USB.
4265880	4269200	So I don't know if it's going to actually support ROMs or if you're going to buy games
4269200	4274160	a la iTunes or what the deal is, because it's really easy to get free Atari games online
4274160	4275160	at this point.
4275160	4280320	I swear to God, the entire collection of Atari games, everything ever made, is six megs.
4280320	4283700	So you could easily fit that on a USB card.
4283700	4284700	Very tiny.
4284700	4289440	But what I would like to see that used for is maybe some homebrew, because even the Atari
4289440	4293120	2600 still has some homebrew love, a lot of homebrew love for it, so you never know what
4293120	4294120	might happen.
4294120	4297640	I don't know if I would necessarily buy this, though, but I don't know, maybe.
4297640	4302220	Depends, if it was like 20 bucks or something, it would be worth it.
4302220	4305720	Games were so simple back then, and sometimes that's kind of like, you know, like I was
4305720	4311680	saying last week, I found myself playing Pitfall for God knows what reason for quite a chunk
4311680	4313540	of time last Saturday.
4313540	4319920	Can you imagine, if you will, if they were to bring combat to Xbox Live Arcade and have
4319920	4321240	like leaderboards for that shit?
4321240	4322240	That'd be fucking awesome.
4322240	4324640	Aren't they going to bring some old Atari classics?
4324640	4327840	I seem to remember Warlords was coming to Xbox Live.
4327840	4328840	That's an old school Atari game.
4328840	4330320	And of course, we have Centipede and Millipede.
4330320	4333320	I want combat with no graphical upgrades whatsoever.
4333320	4335840	I just want the whole thing to be done like that and have like leaderboards.
4335840	4340160	What if they did the classic graphics slash upgrade graphics?
4340160	4343680	I guess, if they really want to do that, but I'd be fine with just the classic graphics,
4343680	4349520	because I think that'd be funny, and just have like a leaderboard thing where you know,
4349520	4350520	win matches and stuff.
4350520	4352560	I did not realize you were such an Atari 2600 fan.
4352560	4355400	Oh, I used to play the Atari 2600 all the time.
4355400	4356400	I'm a huge combat fan.
4356400	4357960	Oh, keep that in mind for later on.
4357960	4359480	We're going to see what happens later on.
4359480	4364160	So, I'm going to tease something coming up in Part B. That's all I have to say.
4364160	4366160	Alright, moving on.
4366160	4373880	Anyways, apparently the ESRB is cracking down on violent game trailers now.
4373880	4378840	Nothing really new, but of course, especially after the whole fiasco with Manhunt 2, they're
4378840	4382800	kind of, I guess, taking notice on some of the trailers that have been released out there,
4382800	4390400	including Gears of War, which was available online since January, is now, of course, coming
4390400	4401760	down and apparently Darkness and Dark Sector videos have been immediately, I guess, pulled
4401760	4406520	because I guess they were too bloody or whatever and I guess were an adult only thing.
4406520	4412640	They should have such things as a red band trailer for games, I think, but I don't know.
4412640	4417440	I think it's kind of stupid though since before they were rating them with, oh, because they're
4417440	4421560	interactive and stuff, we've got to rate them a little harsher, which is dumb anyways, but
4421560	4423200	you're watching a video game play.
4423200	4427560	You don't have any sort of interaction with it.
4427560	4429400	I think game trailers are still pretty safe.
4429400	4431400	I don't understand why.
4431400	4432960	I didn't even know they rated trailers.
4432960	4436480	I know that a lot of times they'll say, you know, this product is not yet rated or something
4436480	4437480	like that.
4437480	4441720	The trailers themselves, yeah, red band trailers, very rare and hard to find.
4441720	4445480	You don't see them a lot in theaters ever, but you see them on home movies sometimes,
4445480	4447120	especially from the indie companies.
4447120	4452120	You sometimes see a red band trailer where the preview is for restricted audiences only
4452120	4457800	and that's because they'll have a gunshot in it or a real quick bloodshot or maybe some
4457800	4458800	booby.
4458800	4463160	It might be an ad for a sexy movie and you see a lady wearing a dress that's see-through
4463160	4464160	or something.
4464160	4466320	You see red band trailers once in a while.
4466320	4470400	I think it's kind of ridiculous though that they're policing game trailers because that's
4470400	4473960	not even, you know, it's not the actual game.
4473960	4477880	It's like kind of a video of it or it's maybe like, you know, I know that they do that with
4477880	4483360	movie trailers, you know, that they rate that this trailer isn't good for all audiences
4483360	4486240	and stuff, but I think it's kind of ridiculous to do that with games.
4486240	4491800	I could've sworn I heard some point that yellow bands were coming for the PG-13 and up audiences
4491800	4492800	only.
4492800	4493800	I can't remember.
4493800	4496600	Maybe it was PG-13 audiences only.
4496600	4499420	We're going to have yellow band trailers, but I don't know if that ever, I might just
4499420	4504040	be pulling that out of my butt, but I seem to remember reading that somewhere, I don't
4504040	4505040	know.
4505040	4510400	Well, obviously this next topic is rated G. This is definitely for everybody.
4510400	4516920	This cat, wait, hold on, DarkDockra is not here this week, but so we can't do a website
4516920	4520480	of the week, but if she could, and she was here this week, I'm pretty sure this would
4520480	4522200	have been a top contender for her website of the week.
4522200	4524360	Okay, yes, Loki, you can do your outburst now.
4524360	4527160	Sorry, this cat right here made me get a cat.
4527160	4528160	Really?
4528160	4529160	Why is that?
4529160	4531080	Because it's super cute and I want a gaming cat.
4531080	4536200	All right, well, yes, this is the Famiko blog and you can visit this blog if you'd like
4536200	4537200	to it.
4537200	4545840	I love fami.blog90.fc2.com and this is just a cat that poses with it, they make poses
4545840	4548200	of it playing the DS and the 360.
4548200	4549200	Did you ever see the other?
4549200	4550200	It's so cute.
4550200	4552840	Yeah, see, I mean, look at that one up, one more, one more up.
4552840	4553840	It was that one.
4553840	4554840	Is that one going down?
4554840	4556080	Yeah, keep going.
4556080	4558400	The one that's playing the DS.
4558400	4560000	The cat is very cute.
4560000	4563720	It's basically, it's like a oolong, but a kitty.
4563720	4569680	This site reminds me a lot of oolong, which was the bunny with pancakes on its head.
4569680	4574720	Have you ever seen the macro that says, this thread has gotten boring, so here's a bunny
4574720	4576160	with pancakes on its head.
4576160	4579840	That was oolong, the famous bunny that would, this blog reminds me of that, except it's
4579840	4584120	a cat and the cat sometimes plays video games, but not always.
4584120	4585120	This is so cute.
4585120	4586120	Go up, go up, go up.
4586120	4587120	Keep going.
4587120	4588120	That's the picture right there.
4588120	4592000	That is a very cute cat.
4592000	4594320	And I believe the cat's name is Famicom, right?
4594320	4595320	It's Fami.
4595320	4597700	Or Fami, named after the Famicom.
4597700	4598700	Very cute.
4598700	4599700	Named after famine.
4599700	4604360	Are you wanting to, you're so messed up.
4604360	4606800	Are you wanting to get a kitty someday, Rice Princess?
4606800	4607800	No.
4607800	4608800	Oh, okay.
4608800	4610320	I just wanted you to contribute something to this show.
4610320	4615280	I am going to attempt to get the cat that we're getting to sit there and oppose that
4615280	4617200	look like it's playing the DS.
4617200	4619600	I don't think it's going to work, but we're going to try it.
4619600	4624120	You know what you need to do is get the cat to pose reading porn.
4624120	4625120	That would be funny.
4625120	4626120	Get a picture of that.
4626120	4629080	I don't have any porn, at least not in magazine form.
