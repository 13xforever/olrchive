00:00.000 --> 00:26.560
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here live on this Sunday evening, July the 15th of 2007.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.200
We're going through the E3 wrap-up, of course.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.040
Now, I know you guys have probably been reading about it on the various blogs, but maybe there's

00:33.040 --> 00:36.840
some things that we caught that maybe slipped off your radars, off the cracks.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.160
And of course, you know, we didn't get to go to E3 this year, so we're just kind of

00:40.160 --> 00:42.600
like a lot of you guys on the outside looking in.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.120
And so we're kind of collecting our thoughts.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.000
What do the people who weren't there think about it?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.440
What are the gaming fans who didn't get to go to E3 this year really think about it?

00:49.440 --> 00:50.440
Because hey, it's our money.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.440
We're spending it.

00:51.440 --> 00:55.040
So we're going to talk tonight about what we thought of the various news there from

00:55.040 --> 00:56.040
E3.

00:56.040 --> 00:59.080
And we talked about Nintendo and Microsoft and Part A. Let's go on to the last press

00:59.080 --> 01:00.800
conference, which was Sony.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
Yes.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.320
And one of the big things coming from the Sony press conference, which some might say

01:05.320 --> 01:11.200
is not really surprising, is a new PSP coming in September.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.520
Not necessarily the PSP 2, but a redesigned PSP.

01:14.520 --> 01:19.200
I guess people are kind of dubbing it PlayStation Portable Slim.

01:19.200 --> 01:27.160
It's supposed to be 33% lighter, 19% slimmer, has a longer battery life, and is also going

01:27.160 --> 01:31.600
to be having a video out on it as well, which is kind of cool.

01:31.600 --> 01:36.720
We'll be retailing for $169.99, so the same price as a normal PSP now.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.040
And we'll eventually replace those as well.

01:39.040 --> 01:47.240
And it will be loaded with the 3.6 firmware, so probably seeing goodbye to homebrew with

01:47.240 --> 01:48.640
that at least.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.600
That's their hopes.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.040
Other interesting things, it will be offered in three different colors, black, silver,

01:56.040 --> 02:00.880
and white, all a little bit glossy, kind of like the DS Lite.

02:00.880 --> 02:05.400
And also, the ice silver will be a part of a $1.99 entertainment package that's going

02:05.400 --> 02:12.160
to be with a 1GB memory stick, Daxter, and Family Guy's freaking suite collection on

02:12.160 --> 02:13.160
UMD.

02:13.160 --> 02:19.600
Also, they're going to be releasing a white Star Wars themed PSP that will retail for

02:19.600 --> 02:20.600
$1.99.

02:20.600 --> 02:27.000
And also, it will be packaged with Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.760
So that is coming in September.

02:30.760 --> 02:31.760
Looks interesting.

02:31.760 --> 02:37.180
I might actually sell my second PSP to get one of these as well, because I like the idea

02:37.180 --> 02:38.840
of video out.

02:38.840 --> 02:42.200
Video out does sound pretty cool, and I know a lot of people kind of wrote it off, like

02:42.200 --> 02:44.680
whoop-de-doo, video out, you know, who cares.

02:44.680 --> 02:48.760
But you know, it does make those UMDs at least a little more usable that you can have them

02:48.760 --> 02:52.640
on your TV, but also, just getting to play, you know, some of these games, like the Final

02:52.640 --> 02:55.240
Fantasy remake and stuff like on my big TV.

02:55.240 --> 03:00.240
If you think about it, if you're looking at, you know, possibly just using this as like

03:00.240 --> 03:06.400
even, you know, portable and stand-alone video player at home, if you don't want to buy DVDs,

03:06.400 --> 03:11.480
a lot of these UMDs are going for like dirt cheap, and you can pick them up, you know,

03:11.480 --> 03:14.580
probably use pretty, under five bucks, so.

03:14.580 --> 03:16.720
How are they going to look when blown up to a big screen though?

03:16.720 --> 03:20.360
They will be 480p, so it will look like a DVD.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.360
It's not bad.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.720
I guess they're encoded at DVD bit rates, it's just, it's shrunken down to the PSP screen,

03:26.720 --> 03:27.720
so.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.720
Really sharp.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.160
It will be pretty sharp, I guess, on normal screen.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.080
It shouldn't be too bad, I don't know.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.960
Maybe it might be letterbox or something.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.960
Yeah, I'm kind of excited about the video out, but the problem is I already own a PSP,

03:37.960 --> 03:41.840
so I don't really want to buy a whole new one just for video out.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.200
I have to admit, I'm a little bit disappointed this wasn't on the first, but I guess this

03:45.200 --> 03:46.680
is how they get you to buy another one, I don't know.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.680
Here's the thing though.

03:47.680 --> 03:52.920
The video out uses the serial port that's on the bottom of the PSP.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.560
Supposedly this one's redesigned.

03:54.560 --> 03:59.480
I'm not sure if that's actually the case, but they're seeing it's redesigned.

03:59.480 --> 04:04.800
So it's possible with this new firmware update 3.6 that maybe with the current ones you can

04:04.800 --> 04:05.800
do that, but.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.680
Please let that be the case.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.120
It would be not, it wouldn't be too surprising if they don't mention that until later on.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.440
Much like certain other stories we'll get into later, where they don't mention certain

04:15.440 --> 04:16.800
aspects of things.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.400
Alright, fair enough.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.120
So do you think you'll pick up a PSP redesign?

04:22.120 --> 04:25.320
I think I will just because I have two of them right now and I want to sell one of them

04:25.320 --> 04:28.360
or at least get rid of it because I have no use for it right now, and that'd be a good

04:28.360 --> 04:32.960
excuse to buy one of those because it wouldn't really cost me much.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.800
The other thing though about it though, this is kind of a trend you'll see at the Sony

04:36.800 --> 04:41.080
press conference, something that they've been denying and denying, yet people are saying

04:41.080 --> 04:47.160
it's going to be happening and we've heard rumors and lo and behold, it's true.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.400
Kind of a trend that's going along with it.

04:49.400 --> 04:53.400
We shall see as we continue throughout the press conference stories here.

04:53.400 --> 05:01.440
Well there is something that I have to say that I actually expected this.

05:01.440 --> 05:07.800
You know with all of the rumors going around about exclusive game this and exclusive game

05:07.800 --> 05:17.960
but I honestly, this is what I expected, is that Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be exclusive

05:17.960 --> 05:20.080
to the PS3.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.360
Reaffirmed.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.000
Not buying it.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Not buying it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
And this is why.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.500
Okay, it may be a PS3 exclusive when it comes out.

05:29.500 --> 05:34.340
I do not doubt that it's going to come to the 360 eventually because it would be dumb

05:34.340 --> 05:41.560
for them to ignore the entire Xbox 360 user base.

05:41.560 --> 05:46.240
It's not because they're plain sides or anything, it's just about money.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.040
They want to sell as many copies of this as possible.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.600
I wouldn't be surprised if we see a release on the Xbox 360 maybe later on.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.400
I will be surprised.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.400
I don't think it's going to happen.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.720
I think it's going to stay on PS3.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.940
I think it really all depends on sales.

06:02.940 --> 06:09.800
I can totally see how it could happen where one of the Metal Gears ended up coming out

06:09.800 --> 06:11.600
for GameCube later on.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.920
I think the first Metal Gear was redone.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.400
I could see something like that happening and this seems to happen a lot with the Metal

06:19.400 --> 06:23.200
Gear series where it shows up on the Sony platform first and then kind of mutates into

06:23.200 --> 06:29.000
a special edition thing that comes out on Xbox or whatever later on but a year later.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.920
I could see something like that happening if the sales aren't strong enough on its own.

06:33.920 --> 06:39.880
So it's really going to depend but a year is such a long wait that it's not going to

06:39.880 --> 06:44.360
have a huge impact as far as the fanboys are concerned.

06:44.360 --> 06:50.320
I think what you can count on, you can count on them not announcing another platform until

06:50.320 --> 06:51.960
well after the game is out.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.440
I think that is something that will be a given.

06:54.440 --> 07:01.960
Unless, for whatever reason, Sony has a really shitty fourth quarter and they don't sell

07:01.960 --> 07:06.880
that many units or whatever and it's looking like, hey, we're not going to sell that many

07:06.880 --> 07:11.840
units of Metal Gear Solid 4, maybe we should rethink this exclusive thing because exclusives

07:11.840 --> 07:13.600
change all the time.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.640
I'm thinking Konami has not only done this with the Metal Gear series but Silent Hill

07:17.640 --> 07:18.640
as well.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.600
Silent Hill 2 was out on the PlayStation 2 first and the Wrestle Streams came out on

07:21.600 --> 07:23.020
Xbox.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.600
Little things like that happen.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.400
Hit Stunt says, I wouldn't doubt if Konami is contractually obligated to say it's not

07:28.400 --> 07:32.760
coming to any other system until the PlayStation 3 version comes out, just like the standard

07:32.760 --> 07:37.600
six month delay like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Virtua Fighter 5.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.600
But you know what?

07:38.600 --> 07:42.600
It's good for them that they do have this because at least this is something, hey, maybe

07:42.600 --> 07:45.360
this will sell a few systems for them.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.120
They need all they can take.

07:47.120 --> 07:53.880
Well, we'll see where that leads but nevertheless the Xbox 360 folks who were convinced it was

07:53.880 --> 07:57.160
coming to their platform get a little bit of a setback.

07:57.160 --> 08:01.560
I suppose hope is never lost but hope has been diminished quite a bit.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.080
Speaking of exclusives, another exclusive that was announced on the PlayStation 3 is

08:05.080 --> 08:06.680
Unreal Tournament 3.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.200
Now it was only affirmed as a timed exclusive for the PlayStation 3 but that does mean if

08:10.200 --> 08:14.480
you're a Sony fan and you got your PlayStation, you're going to get it first on the PlayStation

08:14.480 --> 08:15.480
3.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.120
As far as the timed thing, I could care less.

08:18.120 --> 08:21.760
I think this is the much cooler part about it is that you're going to be able to use

08:21.760 --> 08:25.800
mods on the PlayStation 3 and the PC version.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.520
Now the PC version will come out a little later but that's kind of cool for the modding

08:29.520 --> 08:33.920
community of which a game like Unreal gets a lot of this stuff is that the mods you make

08:33.920 --> 08:36.400
for PC you're going to be able to use on PS3 as well.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.400
That's cool.

08:37.400 --> 08:41.400
And they're saying everything from just weapon mods to total conversions for it are going

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
to be available.

08:42.400 --> 08:47.920
So that's tons of extra content for it which is awesome.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.720
Now we need Duke Nukem 3D with mods and stuff and that'd be cool too.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.760
We shall see.

08:53.760 --> 08:58.400
What's pretty interesting about the whole Unreal Tournament 3 thing is as of May it

08:58.400 --> 09:04.200
was actually going to be exclusive to the 360 so kind of flip-flopped there.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.840
Amazing what money can do.

09:06.840 --> 09:11.600
Something very interesting, probably a little bit surprising would be that NCSoft has actually

09:11.600 --> 09:16.960
pledged support for the PlayStation 3 platform and are going to be releasing exclusive PlayStation

09:16.960 --> 09:18.880
3 online games.

09:18.880 --> 09:23.880
So not sure if they're actually going to be bringing their current titles over like

09:23.880 --> 09:29.600
Lineage, Guild Wars, City of Heroes and stuff like that but they will be making at least

09:29.600 --> 09:33.720
some of their current IPs and new IPs available for the platform.

09:33.720 --> 09:37.920
So that's pretty awesome.

09:37.920 --> 09:42.000
I think NCSoft is a pretty rad company and I like games like Guild Wars and so that's

09:42.000 --> 09:45.240
pretty exciting that they're going to be bringing some more stuff to the consoles and if they

09:45.240 --> 09:47.240
want to go with PlayStation 3 then good for them.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.600
I'm sure Sony's very happy with that announcement.

09:49.600 --> 09:56.600
I'm still waiting on those online games that they were talking about at E3 the year before.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.380
Do you think that maybe some of those are being now ported to PlayStation 3?

10:00.380 --> 10:05.400
I don't see why they weren't all that big graphic monsters.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.520
Maybe if they did all of them at once but I think that their whole intention was having

10:08.520 --> 10:15.200
a big service available to people just to come in and play.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.320
That's what I want to see.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.080
Do you think we might see Guild Wars 2 on the PlayStation 3?

10:19.080 --> 10:20.080
I hope not.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.080
Shit.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.640
I hate MMOs on consoles.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.640
Really?

10:23.640 --> 10:29.200
MMOs should stick to freaking PCs unless they are specifically made for a console.

10:29.200 --> 10:34.660
I disagree on Guild Wars because I believe since the whole format of Guild Wars is you

10:34.660 --> 10:38.720
buy the game and you go online for free.

10:38.720 --> 10:43.160
That really works for a console because they pay those monthly fees and stuff and then

10:43.160 --> 10:47.160
maybe a little bit more casual and later on when they offer their expansions or whatever

10:47.160 --> 10:51.080
you can download those as a microtransaction or whatever.

10:51.080 --> 10:57.920
That would actually work very well for consoles whereas an MMO like Final Fantasy XI or something,

10:57.920 --> 11:02.000
not as good as normal.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Interesting points.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
We shall see what ends up happening.

11:04.000 --> 11:15.000
Well, as far as other stuff, for people who wanted the 60GB PS3, it actually will get

11:15.000 --> 11:17.800
it while you can because we're not going to be getting any more.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.400
So yeah, let's cut the price and then get rid of them.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.640
Seems to me like a clearance option.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.200
Like Overstock, you know?

11:26.200 --> 11:27.560
Buy all this.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.280
It's a bait and switch is what it is.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.360
Yeah, because the 80GB is going to be coming out for $600 next.

11:32.360 --> 11:36.600
And it costs Sony less to make because they put the cheaper emulation thing in it.

11:36.600 --> 11:41.160
That's a nasty fucking trick they played on the hardcore audience.

11:41.160 --> 11:45.840
Most casual gamers aren't going to figure it out, but in my mind that was a bit of a

11:45.840 --> 11:46.840
nasty trick.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.760
They did the same thing though with the 20GB system.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.320
It was only available until about December.

11:51.320 --> 11:55.480
Despite what they say, it was unavailable to buy after about December.

11:55.480 --> 12:01.920
And it's just to give you the impression that you really want that 20GB one, but you can't

12:01.920 --> 12:05.040
find it and you really, really want the system so you're going to spend the extra hundred

12:05.040 --> 12:08.480
dollars on it because you get this free game now and all that stuff.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.680
But I don't know, I'm not surprised.

12:11.680 --> 12:15.160
You know what sucks for our friends in Europe is that they're not getting a price cut.

12:15.160 --> 12:22.480
Instead, what they're getting is a bundle with some first party titles and another six

12:22.480 --> 12:29.360
axis controller for 115 pounds.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.040
Which in my mind just reaffirms why Sony's doing this.

12:32.040 --> 12:36.000
It's not so much about, oh, we're going to give the US a price cut.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.640
It's about, oh, we need to stop losing so much money on the systems, so we're going

12:39.640 --> 12:42.920
to give the US the system we've been putting out in Europe that costs us less to make.

12:42.920 --> 12:48.200
Well, they'll be getting a choice to pick from Resistance Fall of Man, Motorstorm, Genji,

12:48.200 --> 12:52.800
Days of the Blade, Formula One, Championship Edition, Ridge Racer 7, two of those plus

12:52.800 --> 12:56.720
the two six axis controllers and it'll be available.

12:56.720 --> 13:04.280
It's actually due on sale on the 18th of July for the UK and starting in Europe on the first

13:04.280 --> 13:05.840
of August.

13:05.840 --> 13:12.040
Well, if you want to get a PlayStation 3 and emulation is of a concern to you, maybe you

13:12.040 --> 13:17.240
don't have a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 1, this would probably be the time to get

13:17.240 --> 13:18.240
it.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.640
I mean, honestly, if there's one positive thing you could say about this is that it

13:20.640 --> 13:23.760
does give you the chance to snatch up that system while you still can.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.240
Be sure to read the labels carefully.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.520
The new systems will show you.

13:27.520 --> 13:32.120
It has a little warning about the emulation on the new box that says not all games are

13:32.120 --> 13:33.120
actually playable.

13:33.120 --> 13:39.160
Now, you know, it wouldn't be fair to mention this and then not mention, well, you know,

13:39.160 --> 13:44.240
the Xbox 360 uses software emulation as well, so to rag Sony for cutting back on the emulation

13:44.240 --> 13:47.760
may be a little bit unfair, I don't know, but however, I don't know.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.360
You do still feel like the sense of loss with this whole little switch going on and the

13:52.360 --> 13:56.240
fact that they're, you know, maybe I don't want to dig out my PlayStation 2 and I'm

13:56.240 --> 13:58.440
going to go through all this to hook up my PlayStation 3.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.440
I don't know.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.440
All right.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.400
Well, anyhow, let's go on to another game that was announced by Sony.

14:03.400 --> 14:07.960
Now, this is something original and this is good because Sony needs to have more original

14:07.960 --> 14:13.400
fun stuff, more original IPs to really differentiate themselves from Microsoft, and so they came

14:13.400 --> 14:15.480
up with a game called Echo Chrome.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.280
This is something that was introduced by Phil Harrison, and what's very interesting about

14:19.280 --> 14:22.120
Echo Chrome is that the graphics are very simplistic.

14:22.120 --> 14:27.320
They're black and white MC Escher-style drawings, and what's kind of cool, I watched a video

14:27.320 --> 14:31.740
of this game in motion, is that the way you rotate the screen around will affect the way

14:31.740 --> 14:35.960
the painting looks, thusly affecting the little runner that runs around the painting.

14:35.960 --> 14:40.440
Now, there's little holes and little launch pads and little gaps that as you rotate the

14:40.440 --> 14:43.620
screen become filled because of your perspective.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.440
It's a very interesting type of thing for a puzzle game.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.140
It's certainly not going to push the envelope as far as next-gen graphics are concerned,

14:50.140 --> 14:56.380
but the graphics are crisp, according to folks that have seen it, crisp, clean, sharp graphics

14:56.380 --> 14:58.520
that might actually be kind of fun.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.520
But I look at this and I kind of go, this looks like it better be a download title.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.200
I could not see myself paying 60 bucks for something like this.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.440
It's going to be a download title.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.440
Thank God.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.440
It's also coming with a PSP.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.440
Okay, cool.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.920
Well, it's a download title that looks pretty rad.

15:12.920 --> 15:16.440
That's right up there with some of the classics on Xbox Live Arcade.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.260
It could be pretty awesome.

15:18.260 --> 15:22.680
So good for them with something original that gets people going, oh, something new as opposed

15:22.680 --> 15:26.100
to a sequel to the same old thing.

15:26.100 --> 15:30.640
Other things that they're showing off there, one other thing for the redesigned PSP is

15:30.640 --> 15:35.840
it's going to actually have an improved UMD slot there, so you're not going to have any

15:35.840 --> 15:38.800
launched UMDs from dropping the system on the ground.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.720
Also it's going to have double the RAM, so it's going to load those UMDs a little bit

15:42.720 --> 15:43.720
faster.

15:43.720 --> 15:47.320
Plus, it's supposed to make web browsing a little bit easier, be able to load some of

15:47.320 --> 15:50.840
the larger pages out there and stuff.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.240
Other things they were showing off, Gran Turismo 5.

15:54.240 --> 15:58.920
It's going to be coming out, of course, next year at some point.

15:58.920 --> 16:03.760
They're going to be releasing a Gran Turismo 5 prologue to the PlayStation Network.

16:03.760 --> 16:09.480
That's going to be just like Gran Turismo HD, a little bit of a demo taste of it as

16:09.480 --> 16:10.480
you will.

16:10.480 --> 16:14.560
Also, they were showing home and some of the improvements done to that.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.960
They've redesigned the whole lobby system for it.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.960
It looks almost like an outdoor mall.

16:19.960 --> 16:28.120
Also you'll be able to jump into multiplayer games with people as well.

16:28.120 --> 16:32.960
That's pretty much the big stuff they were showing off on their network.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.920
My only gripe with them, remember last week how we were talking about, oh yeah, they're

16:37.920 --> 16:42.840
going to be bringing demos and videos to the PlayStation Network.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.080
It's going to be just like the Xbox Live thing.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.880
They're going to be bringing it home and stuff.

16:47.880 --> 16:48.880
No they didn't.

16:48.880 --> 16:49.880
They brought videos.

16:49.880 --> 16:54.020
Great, because I can watch those all over the internet and stuff.

16:54.020 --> 16:56.760
Not a single demo.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.960
Bobby Blackwolf has asked why you're not mentioning Chewbacca.

16:59.960 --> 17:06.800
Okay, Chewbacca announced the PSP redesign thing with Darth Vader.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.800
Great.

17:07.800 --> 17:14.200
At least that guy is still getting work.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.720
Same thing we've done before for all of the other three conferences.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.920
Chat room, I ask for your opinion as well.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.320
What did you think of the Sony press conference?

17:22.320 --> 17:23.320
Rate it on scale.

17:23.320 --> 17:24.320
Tell me what you thought.

17:24.320 --> 17:27.320
Who wants to go first?

17:27.320 --> 17:29.020
Well right, Dark Soccer without resounding yawn.

17:29.020 --> 17:30.020
Is that your summary?

17:30.020 --> 17:31.020
Yeah.

17:31.020 --> 17:32.020
Okay.

17:32.020 --> 17:33.020
Short and sweet.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.020
Loki.

17:34.020 --> 17:39.480
I think their whole theme of promises, promises and not following through has kind of shown

17:39.480 --> 17:41.680
through again this year.

17:41.680 --> 17:47.500
The price cut, they made it look like a price cut but it's actually not a price cut which

17:47.500 --> 17:48.840
is fucked up.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.480
Not to mention some other stuff we'll get into a little bit later on that's also fucked

17:52.480 --> 17:55.720
up especially if you buy a system now.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.200
And just this whole, oh look at all these games that are coming out and not mentioning,

17:59.200 --> 18:01.240
oh by the way they're not coming out until next year.

18:01.240 --> 18:04.280
I do have to give them props on Killzone 2 though.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.580
That looks fucking amazing.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.240
And that is about the only thing.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.240
Thank you for satisfying a chat comment before I read it.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.880
Tigerclaw was just complaining, we forgot to mention the new Killzone 2 trailer.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.520
I didn't forget to mention it.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.120
I didn't mention it on purpose.

18:15.120 --> 18:20.640
It looks really good and it's actually, it's a game I want to buy now because it looks

18:20.640 --> 18:22.160
kind of like Resistance a bit.

18:22.160 --> 18:26.120
You know, Resistance with a little bit of Gears of War thrown in there and I think that's

18:26.120 --> 18:27.120
pretty awesome.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.120
It impressed me a lot more than Halo 3 did.

18:29.120 --> 18:33.680
So you know, props to them for that but the problem is it's not coming out this year.

18:33.680 --> 18:39.360
So once again you're show me shit that, you know, I'm not going to buy your Playstation

18:39.360 --> 18:41.680
3 for these games that are coming out next year.

18:41.680 --> 18:46.240
At least I wouldn't be buying it if I didn't have one right now this holiday season which

18:46.240 --> 18:48.680
is really where it's going to count for you guys.

18:48.680 --> 18:53.120
It's, I'll be buying it when it comes out, you know, actually in the summer of next year

18:53.120 --> 18:54.260
or whatever.

18:54.260 --> 18:56.380
So it doesn't do them any good for this holiday.

18:56.380 --> 19:00.840
Once again, if they don't come out with something amazing, they're going to lose out on another

19:00.840 --> 19:01.840
holiday.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.800
It's really going to hurt them.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.240
The only thing I really care about coming out of there is, of course, Silent Hill 5

19:07.240 --> 19:11.200
and I really want Metal Gear Solid 4.

19:11.200 --> 19:17.240
As far as my thoughts on Sony's press conference, you know, I said before last week that Nintendo

19:17.240 --> 19:20.520
had the most to lose going into E3 and Sony had the most to gain.

19:20.520 --> 19:21.960
Getting a new Civ game?

19:21.960 --> 19:25.440
Well, yeah, but that's, well it's also coming on Xbox 360 though.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.680
I downloaded the trailer and I'm pretty excited about that.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.240
But that's different.

19:29.240 --> 19:34.040
You know, I think Sony did a way better job than they did last year.

19:34.040 --> 19:39.680
I think, you know, they certainly changed the tone of their press conference and had

19:39.680 --> 19:43.720
it a little well oiled and got the kinks a little better, worked out this year.

19:43.720 --> 19:49.040
But I still walked away from it being more excited about the PSP than the Playstation

19:49.040 --> 19:50.040
3.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.280
And I don't know if that's a good sign.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.640
This whole bait and switch leaves a real bad taste to my mind.

19:54.640 --> 19:55.640
Here's the problem.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.480
Last year, remember, last year it was all, oh, Gran Turismo 5, it's going to be like

19:58.480 --> 20:02.560
Gran Turismo HD and stuff, but better and all this stuff.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.440
No Gran Turismo 5 this year.

20:04.440 --> 20:09.200
And then this, you know, the E3, ooh, Gran Turismo 5, it's so awesome and stuff.

20:09.200 --> 20:16.840
You know, and it does look really good, but Project Gotham 4 also looks really good.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.600
And if this game is going to take, you know, until Summer 08 to come out, they're going

20:21.600 --> 20:25.400
to have Project Gotham Racing 5, which is going to look even more amazing.

20:25.400 --> 20:31.720
And it's just, it's all this promising of really good games that are coming out way

20:31.720 --> 20:32.720
later.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.720
That's the problem.

20:33.720 --> 20:37.360
It's not like Microsoft where it's like, here's these great games, they're coming out this

20:37.360 --> 20:38.360
Fall.

20:38.360 --> 20:42.920
You know, get excited for them because they're right around the corner, whereas this stuff

20:42.920 --> 20:44.720
is coming way later on.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.280
Yeah, I kind of feel the same way as that.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.520
You know, it sounds like I'll have a lot more to get excited about with the Playstation 3

20:50.520 --> 20:51.520
at next year's E3.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.520
Exactly.

20:52.520 --> 20:56.200
Like Final Fantasy XIII is there, but is it going to be too late?

20:56.200 --> 20:57.200
I don't know.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.360
Or remember, like, you know, they're showing LittleBigPlanet, that's next year.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.200
They're talking about Home, which I hope that's this year.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.760
I mean, it's, yeah, I don't know.

21:05.760 --> 21:10.160
So it's just disappointing in that sense.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.160
I don't know.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.960
Part of me on a scale of 1 to 10 wants to give Sony a question mark for, I just don't

21:14.960 --> 21:15.960
know.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.680
Like, their press conference looks like the town of Silent Hill.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.640
There's too much haze around everything for me.

21:21.640 --> 21:28.000
I will give them, I will reward them for their PSP redesign, even though, you know, they're

21:28.000 --> 21:30.440
taking the old ones away or whatever's supposed to be happening.

21:30.440 --> 21:37.960
You know, I give that good points, but the Playstation 3, although some games look cool,

21:37.960 --> 21:39.980
I'm not completely blown away, but I give them credit.

21:39.980 --> 21:42.760
I give them the most improved player award.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.740
I would give their conference a 6.

21:45.740 --> 21:46.740
Explain this to me.

21:46.740 --> 21:52.360
Why should I get a PS3 with a larger hard drive when there's nothing to download for

21:52.360 --> 21:53.360
it?

21:53.360 --> 21:59.440
There's trailers for movies, there's trailers for games, there's literally less than ten

21:59.440 --> 22:06.000
demos online, and there's a handful of, you know, Playstation download titles.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.920
So am I buying this larger hard drive system for, you know, so I can dump some of my games

22:12.920 --> 22:16.560
stuff to the hard drive so it can cache the system and make it run faster since the Blu

22:16.560 --> 22:17.840
Ray drive's too slow?

22:17.840 --> 22:22.720
I mean, it's, they haven't really shown me why we need to buy a system with a larger

22:22.720 --> 22:24.640
hard drive in the first place.

22:24.640 --> 22:30.040
They're really pushing, trust me, hard drive space is not what's holding people back from

22:30.040 --> 22:33.160
buying your system.

22:33.160 --> 22:37.440
Black Wolf says, going to chat room, all three companies pretty much surrendered the press

22:37.440 --> 22:38.880
conferences.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.040
Flora Dean says, Sony fails three.

22:42.040 --> 22:45.540
Dark Tetsuya says, I liked everything I saw except the new Ratchet and Clank, which should

22:45.540 --> 22:48.400
just be released on Playstation 2 if it's not already.

22:48.400 --> 22:54.000
SSJ100Matt says, Sony, they showed everyone what they wanted, games, Killzone 2, Unreal

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
3, etc.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.280
They showed that the Playstation 3 has real future, solid B+, A-.

23:00.280 --> 23:03.200
You know what, I will give them credit for this and maybe, actually, maybe I'll bump

23:03.200 --> 23:08.580
up my score to a seven for this sole reason, the eye of judgment was nowhere to be seen.

23:08.580 --> 23:11.440
So I will bump up Sony's score to seven for scrapping that piece of shit.

23:11.440 --> 23:15.000
They showed it on the show floor, so that was there.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.560
We're great in the conference, so I'll give them the bonus point.

23:18.560 --> 23:25.080
I will give them the same as I gave Nintendo a six, just because it's promises, and I think

23:25.080 --> 23:30.080
there's going to be, you know, where the disappointments were with the whole...

23:30.080 --> 23:31.880
Black Wolf says, eye of judgment was not on the floor.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.240
Well, I saw a video of it, so I know that it was there in some...

23:35.240 --> 23:36.520
Maybe behind a door that maybe...

23:36.520 --> 23:37.520
Bobby didn't look behind.

23:37.520 --> 23:44.280
Well, it was there, they were showing it, but, you know, I just...

23:44.280 --> 23:45.600
I think people are going to get...

23:45.600 --> 23:50.920
It's going to be a whole line of disappointments with Sony, and that's just...

23:50.920 --> 23:54.080
As we go through the fourth quarter, it's just going to be disappointment after disappointment.

23:54.080 --> 23:58.900
I think the PlayStation 3 is really set to go the same way as the PSP.

23:58.900 --> 24:03.840
It's not going to get really, really cool until like three years later, or two or three

24:03.840 --> 24:04.840
years later.

24:04.840 --> 24:05.840
Yeah, unfortunately.

24:05.840 --> 24:06.840
Kind of interesting.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.360
All right.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.620
Black Wolf says it might have been in their invite-only hotel suite.

24:11.620 --> 24:15.680
He wanted to ask about the copying of cards just for you, about going to Kinko's and making

24:15.680 --> 24:17.800
your own cards.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.920
Here's their reasoning behind it.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.840
They're saying...

24:21.840 --> 24:24.740
They basically didn't give a reason.

24:24.740 --> 24:28.480
There's no copy protection on the cards, but their thing was, you know, it would be like

24:28.480 --> 24:31.440
playing Magic the Gathering with someone with photocopied cards.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.340
Like you'd really play someone with photocopied cards.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.080
That was their reasoning behind it.

24:36.080 --> 24:40.480
So in other words, yes, you can copy the cards or download images off the internet instead

24:40.480 --> 24:45.440
of buying booster packs and copying the card stock, and it'll work just fine.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.880
The Rob D. asks, the PSP is really, really cool?

24:48.880 --> 24:50.720
I might buy a PSP for the emulation.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.000
All right, maybe less of the really, really.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.040
But you know, the PSP has never been solely a gaming system.

24:57.040 --> 25:00.380
I do respect the system for everything else it can do, like being kind of a little mini

25:00.380 --> 25:02.480
media kit.

25:02.480 --> 25:07.240
But yeah, there's some pretty cool stuff that have come out for it in the past year.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.660
I think they can't be ignored.

25:08.660 --> 25:12.320
But did you notice, though, that they're kind of making the PSP out now to be almost like

25:12.320 --> 25:14.360
more of an iPod or a Zune or something?

25:14.360 --> 25:17.920
Because now it has a video out thing on it, and you're going to be able to charge it using

25:17.920 --> 25:20.000
the USB cable on there as well.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.200
So if you're on the go, you can charge it and stuff.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.740
And then of course, memory stick prices are coming down quite a bit.

25:26.740 --> 25:29.380
So I don't know.

25:29.380 --> 25:30.380
It's interesting.

25:30.380 --> 25:42.000
Their PR department is so horrible, so horrible, and their upper management needs to shut the

25:42.000 --> 25:43.240
hell up.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.240
It's not helping them.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.880
And I know Ken Kutaragi's gone now because he was making dumb statements before and stuff.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.560
But my god, Kazurai is not any better.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.440
It's not any better with him.

25:54.440 --> 25:56.960
All right, well, there you have it.

25:56.960 --> 26:00.160
Our thoughts on the Sony press conference.

26:00.160 --> 26:04.880
Let's go now to some more listener feedback via the email bag, because we love to get

26:04.880 --> 26:05.880
emails.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.920
And if you weren't in our chat room tonight and you want to give your two cents to the

26:07.920 --> 26:13.360
press conferences or anything you saw at E3, send us an email, mailbag at orangelauntrader.com,

26:13.360 --> 26:17.200
because Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag every week and reads a few of her favorite pieces

26:17.200 --> 26:18.960
of email here with us.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.960
So Dark Sakura?

26:19.960 --> 26:21.920
Hee hee hee, Captain Crayola.

26:21.920 --> 26:29.200
Jump in the mailbag and pull something out for us, will you?

26:29.200 --> 26:30.200
Email.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.200
Hi, OLR crew.

26:31.200 --> 26:35.280
I guess this is where I should say I'm a long time listener, but a first time emailer.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.200
I first heard about your show from Bobby Black Wolf.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.680
He's an old friend of mine from the days when we were moderators on the forums for a TV

26:40.680 --> 26:45.600
channel that are left unmentioned and have been listening to the podcast on and off for

26:45.600 --> 26:46.600
about a year.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.820
I always find the show enjoyable and you've become one of my mainstays for relatively

26:49.820 --> 26:54.560
unbiased or biased in a way that matches my own opinions at gaming news.

26:54.560 --> 26:58.360
Recently I listened to the podcast of your five year plus one episode and I have a bone

26:58.360 --> 27:01.120
to pick with Loki and Rob regarding the Harvest Moon series.

27:01.120 --> 27:06.040
Loki is on record as enjoying sandbox games and the Harvest Moon series fits this description

27:06.040 --> 27:10.240
to a T. The games have something for everyone.

27:10.240 --> 27:14.560
Real time strategy fans can strategize to get the most crops each season, those who

27:14.560 --> 27:20.760
enjoy dating sims can and most of the games date the NPCs, culminating in creating a family.

27:20.760 --> 27:25.280
Action fans can have fun catching fish, chopping down trees and planting endless fields of

27:25.280 --> 27:29.840
grass, RPG fans can engage in as many tedious and pointless quests as have ever been found

27:29.840 --> 27:31.340
in one game.

27:31.340 --> 27:34.480
There are no expectations and certainly no requirements for the manner in which one plays

27:34.480 --> 27:36.440
the game, what's not to love.

27:36.440 --> 27:40.300
Not liking the series because farming isn't for you makes more sense than disliking them

27:40.300 --> 27:42.680
because all the games are the same.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.240
After all doesn't Halo do the same thing?

27:45.240 --> 27:48.120
Anyway my husband and I love the show and are looking forward to listening for years

27:48.120 --> 27:49.120
to come.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.120
Thanks for brightening up our week.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.120
Yours the black monster.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.200
P.S. this email was written on a G4 titanium power book.

27:54.200 --> 27:59.280
I'll address this.

27:59.280 --> 28:02.020
It's not a sandbox game, it's a sim for one.

28:02.020 --> 28:06.840
It's a farming sim and granted yeah it has RPG elements and stuff like that, much like

28:06.840 --> 28:09.840
Animal Crossing is also like a sim.

28:09.840 --> 28:13.680
It's basically you're doing tasks and stuff.

28:13.680 --> 28:14.680
Same kind of thing.

28:14.680 --> 28:15.680
Let's go for the game.

28:15.680 --> 28:22.580
My problem with it, and you may want to compare it to Halo I guess, yeah Microsoft isn't releasing

28:22.580 --> 28:24.720
eight copies of the game a year.

28:24.720 --> 28:29.840
I mean seriously there are so many Harvest Moon games they're saying that are different

28:29.840 --> 28:31.560
but aren't really different.

28:31.560 --> 28:35.320
Like there's the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls which I'm going to take a wild guess and say

28:35.320 --> 28:40.440
it's probably just like the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls on the GameCube and stuff like that.

28:40.440 --> 28:45.560
There's the whole innocent life of futuristic Harvest Moon or something like that which

28:45.560 --> 28:53.040
was just like a futuristic setting, still farming and still all the same stuff.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.180
Great if that's for you, awesome.

28:55.180 --> 28:56.180
It's not a sandbox game.

28:56.180 --> 28:58.040
This is not Grand Theft Auto farming.

28:58.040 --> 29:02.120
See this is the problem is that this game doesn't involve guns and violence.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.560
That's where your problem is.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.640
The problem is it doesn't change.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.320
It's not innovating any.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.120
I mean it's farming.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.120
Okay great.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.280
Are there different crops this time?

29:11.280 --> 29:12.280
Oh goody.

29:12.280 --> 29:19.040
I mean it's not like you have a crop or something and you have to fight off the man who's trying

29:19.040 --> 29:22.840
to steal your property to build a mall or something on it.

29:22.840 --> 29:27.240
I think what's going on here is that sandbox is kind of being seen as a very general term

29:27.240 --> 29:34.760
where Loki likes a very specific type of sandbox game like the 3D jump, shoot, find, destroy

29:34.760 --> 29:37.400
rape type of sandbox game.

29:37.400 --> 29:41.320
Sandbox games are basically games you can go in there and do whatever you want and tackle

29:41.320 --> 29:42.320
it however you want.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.520
This is a farming, this is a sim game.

29:44.520 --> 29:51.880
You start off with crops, you tend to the crops and stuff and it's a farming sim with

29:51.880 --> 29:53.560
RPG elements.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.480
From my perspective I've tried Harvest Moon.

29:56.480 --> 30:01.360
I played the one on the GameCube and I just couldn't get into it.

30:01.360 --> 30:05.680
I think for me there was just kind of like too much going on at once.

30:05.680 --> 30:10.480
It didn't have that kind of simplicity that Animal Crossing had but I don't know.

30:10.480 --> 30:14.160
I guess maybe I need to give the series another look because if I like Animal Crossing I should

30:14.160 --> 30:19.560
like something like Harvest Moon but I just wasn't feeling it.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.280
There was nothing to keep me coming back.

30:21.280 --> 30:28.680
What they need to do is instead of releasing four or five titles a year of Harvest Moon,

30:28.680 --> 30:33.720
just release one good title of Harvest Moon each year and do it that way.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.640
Put some more effort into the game instead of just rehashing the same thing and giving

30:37.640 --> 30:38.640
a new coat of paint.

30:38.640 --> 30:42.880
A devil's advocate, I have to, I may not agree with what I'm about to say but devil's advocate

30:42.880 --> 30:43.880
I have to.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.160
Doesn't DDR do the same damn thing?

30:45.160 --> 30:46.160
Yes it does.

30:46.160 --> 30:50.320
It does the same damn thing and that's another reason why that series is starting to go downhill.

30:50.320 --> 30:54.920
It's because that's all they do is just give it a new fresh coat of paint, change the colors

30:54.920 --> 30:59.240
of the menu or something and then just add some new songs and that's it and expect you

30:59.240 --> 31:00.240
to buy it.

31:00.240 --> 31:04.000
Can we talk about something other than Harvest Moon now?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Absolutely.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.720
This next email is super cool.

31:06.720 --> 31:10.220
Dear OLR crew, this is Rama the Blind from Indonesia.

31:10.220 --> 31:13.520
I finally wrote my second email to you and I hope I could share some video game related

31:13.520 --> 31:17.600
contents that might interest you all and all of your listeners.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.920
First of all, I would like to announce that I finally bought a Wii.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.840
That's because I've got nostalgia for old Nintendo systems so I wish I could play some

31:23.840 --> 31:28.840
of the old classic games via virtual console or perhaps I could hear my friends play the

31:28.840 --> 31:32.600
games as my condition makes me impossible to play all the games.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.100
I tried experimenting with the Wiimote and discovered that Wii bowling is actually playable

31:36.100 --> 31:37.100
by the blind.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.520
Even though I cannot control the ball accurately, the game is still fun for the blind.

31:40.520 --> 31:45.200
By measuring the distance between both sides, left and right TV screen, I can move my Wii

31:45.200 --> 31:49.160
mote within the range and that's how Wii bowling becomes playable as I don't need to see the

31:49.160 --> 31:51.620
screen.

31:51.620 --> 31:56.220
Right now, I'm still trying some other Wii titles and I hope I could discover more games

31:56.220 --> 31:57.480
for blinds to play.

31:57.480 --> 32:02.400
I wish that Nintendo could make a research about this and perhaps create accessible contents

32:02.400 --> 32:03.400
for the blind to purchase.

32:03.400 --> 32:08.640
So you guys, do you have any comments about this?

32:08.640 --> 32:12.240
Well I appreciate hearing back because it's always interesting to hear from this kind

32:12.240 --> 32:17.080
of like perspective that doesn't often get enough recognition at large in gaming blogs

32:17.080 --> 32:18.080
and things.

32:18.080 --> 32:19.400
There were sound games on the Saturn back in the day.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.480
Why can't Nintendo do that?

32:20.480 --> 32:22.640
I'm actually going to turn around and ask another question.

32:22.640 --> 32:26.040
I'm really curious because I bet this email was sent in before Nintendo's press conference

32:26.040 --> 32:27.040
this week.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.600
I'm really curious what this emailer thinks about some of these other new innovations

32:29.600 --> 32:34.720
like Wii Fit and some of these other directions that Nintendo's going that has a little more

32:34.720 --> 32:36.600
to do with movement.

32:36.600 --> 32:37.600
That makes sense.

32:37.600 --> 32:42.520
Well, email us back, actually I'm going to have to ask him to email us back because of

32:42.520 --> 32:43.520
the next part.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.520
Did you have a comment?

32:44.520 --> 32:51.440
Oh, I was just going to say that unfortunately blind gamers are such a small percentage of

32:51.440 --> 32:55.600
their demographic that I don't think you're ever going to see anything that's really dedicated

32:55.600 --> 33:00.800
to it unless you get some independent company out there that's really gearing towards that.

33:00.800 --> 33:04.440
There's no reason for them to make sound based games unless they can do something pretty

33:04.440 --> 33:08.000
innovative because there was some stuff on the Game Boy Advance that was just part of

33:08.000 --> 33:13.840
that bit generation series but it's just unfortunately blind handicapped and stuff.

33:13.840 --> 33:19.320
It is such a small area for them that there's unfortunately not going to see much publishers

33:19.320 --> 33:20.720
out there focusing on that.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.960
What about something that would make the existing games more accessible to the audience?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.680
That's great if they can do something like that.

33:25.680 --> 33:31.040
I sort of think about how Windows has the zoom feature and those other types of accessibility

33:31.040 --> 33:32.840
options.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.800
Could a game console adapt something similar?

33:34.800 --> 33:35.800
That's possible.

33:35.800 --> 33:36.800
I don't know.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.800
World Combat Armageddon though would probably be a lot easier to play.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.240
You can waggle the thing around and throw...

33:42.240 --> 33:43.240
Broadcalibur!

33:43.240 --> 33:44.240
Anyhow, sorry.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.040
Let the email finish.

33:47.040 --> 33:50.480
The next part is another thing I would like to share is a Final Fantasy concert held in

33:50.480 --> 33:51.480
my country.

33:51.480 --> 33:56.040
Actually, this is the second one as the concert was also held last year but it was still enjoyable

33:56.040 --> 34:01.080
especially in Indonesia where video game music is rare to find and game music concert is

34:01.080 --> 34:03.080
like a distant dream.

34:03.080 --> 34:06.680
You did say you uploaded pictures and videos from the concert.

34:06.680 --> 34:11.520
I want your permission before I make that public to chat.

34:11.520 --> 34:15.720
Or if you would like to go into our forum at orangelesradio.com and make a thread about

34:15.720 --> 34:19.400
it then we would appreciate you sharing it with everybody that way.

34:19.400 --> 34:23.140
I wish in the future another video game music concert will again be held here perhaps by

34:23.140 --> 34:26.920
video game music live or play a video game symphony.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.080
I think that's all for now.

34:28.080 --> 34:56.800
Take care and have a good show.

37:28.080 --> 37:33.960
Thanks for the show and let you guys know that you have yet another developer listening.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.640
Feel free to write if you have any questions or issues I can help with.

37:36.640 --> 37:40.600
I'm just going to use the nickname hero antagonist.

37:40.600 --> 37:41.600
You know, it's funny.

37:41.600 --> 37:45.920
I heard back from the developer that emailed us previously and he was willing to do an

37:45.920 --> 37:47.840
ask a developer type segment.

37:47.840 --> 37:51.400
So maybe we can get this guy in on it too and have some type of like round table thing

37:51.400 --> 37:52.400
on a later show.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.720
That might be kind of fun especially during the next few months.

37:55.720 --> 37:59.000
It might be a little bit slow before we get into the fall rush of game news.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.560
It might be kind of fun to do an ask a developer round table.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.960
So please write us back if you'd be willing to participate.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.600
You can contact me directly or send back the email back, whatever, because we're going

38:07.600 --> 38:09.620
to try definitely doing something like that in the future.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.620
This one's short.

38:10.620 --> 38:11.620
Hey, OLR.

38:11.620 --> 38:14.480
I know I'm kind of late with this one, but happy belated birthday, OLR.

38:14.480 --> 38:16.040
You guys are awesome and keep it up.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.040
Ron.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.040
Thank you, Ron.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.040
Thank you.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.480
Did you bring us a present?

38:20.480 --> 38:21.480
I'm sorry.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.760
You said Ron and I think of Potter Puppet Pals.

38:23.760 --> 38:24.760
Stop.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.760
It's Snape.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.760
Let's bother him.

38:26.760 --> 38:27.760
No.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.760
This last one.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.760
Hey, guys.

38:29.760 --> 38:33.360
I just want to say I love the show and what do you think about young gamers on online

38:33.360 --> 38:36.080
games that they really shouldn't play?

38:36.080 --> 38:38.080
I'm 14, so I really shouldn't be talking.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.280
I just wanted your opinion.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.280
Sincerely, Christian.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.960
Who says you shouldn't talk if you're 14?

38:42.960 --> 38:43.960
I mean age.

38:43.960 --> 38:44.960
Age is a number.

38:44.960 --> 38:45.960
Age is a number.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.520
Maturity is everything.

38:47.520 --> 38:54.680
I think if you can play a game maturely and that doesn't mean you have to play adult or

38:54.680 --> 38:55.680
act adult.

38:55.680 --> 39:00.040
You can have fun but still be mature and by that I mean you don't go onto Xbox Live and

39:00.040 --> 39:06.140
yell NNNFFF and all those words that people scream on Xbox Live.

39:06.140 --> 39:12.880
If you can have fun and have that self-deprecating humor and laugh and have a good time, then

39:12.880 --> 39:16.160
fun doesn't have an age limit.

39:16.160 --> 39:20.080
I am totally supportive of 14-year-olds playing online games.

39:20.080 --> 39:24.720
If your parents are aware and if you're getting all your homework and all your other life

39:24.720 --> 39:30.280
obligations done, it's not cutting into that, I think it's just like watching Nickelodeon

39:30.280 --> 39:31.280
or whatever else is on TV.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.280
I do have a suggestion.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.280
What?

39:33.280 --> 39:34.280
Use periods when you type.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.280
He's 14.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.200
Give him a break.

39:38.200 --> 39:43.320
I had perfect grammar when I was 14.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.680
Let's dig up some of your high school papers and check.

39:45.680 --> 39:46.680
Honestly?

39:46.680 --> 39:49.520
No, I really don't care that much.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.160
I can say it because I can prove it.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.160
I can back it up.

39:52.160 --> 40:04.640
If you're typing on an MMO and you have something to say, something my granddaddy used to always

40:04.640 --> 40:09.560
say, I will quote a bit of wisdom, put brain in gear before mouth in motion.

40:09.560 --> 40:14.600
In this case, put brain in gear before typing, I guess.

40:14.600 --> 40:18.720
Kevin DDR in chat would like to point out, I am a 14-year-old playing online games so

40:18.720 --> 40:19.720
you're not alone.

40:19.720 --> 40:20.720
Well, you're not alone.

40:20.720 --> 40:21.720
There we go.

40:21.720 --> 40:28.520
It's just a matter of just thinking before you do something.

40:28.520 --> 40:34.160
I was playing online games at 14 only when I was 14 the online games we had to play were

40:34.160 --> 40:40.880
Legend of the Red Dragon, Trade Wars, The Pit, and so on and so on and if you catch

40:40.880 --> 40:43.680
my references, you're a winner.

40:43.680 --> 40:46.360
Is that it?

40:46.360 --> 40:47.360
That's it.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.360
All right.

40:48.360 --> 40:51.640
If you'd like to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

40:51.640 --> 40:56.480
By the way, I give everybody a hard time for their grammar so don't worry about it.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.480
Mine's really not all that great.

40:58.480 --> 41:01.200
Well, it's really better than Rob's on AIM though.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.200
I will say that.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.200
All right.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.760
Anyhow, shut up.

41:04.760 --> 41:10.880
We will get on to some other news coming out of E3 that didn't necessarily have to do with

41:10.880 --> 41:11.880
the press conferences.

41:11.880 --> 41:16.880
Actually, I want to spend a little time talking about music games because that's how we started.

41:16.880 --> 41:17.880
That's our roots.

41:17.880 --> 41:21.380
We need to talk about some of the music games that were going on at E3 and some of the events

41:21.380 --> 41:23.240
that happened this week outside of E3.

41:23.240 --> 41:29.360
Let's start with a game that was coming out from EA.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.640
It's called Boogie.

41:30.640 --> 41:34.240
EA announced the soundtrack to the game called Boogie.

41:34.240 --> 41:39.400
It comes with a karaoke microphone and it's actually on the Wii.

41:39.400 --> 41:44.960
They were trying to put together basically a lot of generations of hits.

41:44.960 --> 41:49.640
In this game, you're supposed to be able to dance, sing, and make music videos using the

41:49.640 --> 41:50.960
Wii controls.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.280
That should be interesting.

41:52.280 --> 41:59.240
Some of the songs that will be in this game, ABC by the Jackson 5, Brick House by the Commodores,

41:59.240 --> 42:04.400
Canned Heat by Jamiroquai, Love Roller Coaster by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Let's Get It

42:04.400 --> 42:09.720
Started by the Black Eyed Peas, Love Shack by the B-52s, Milkshake by Kelis.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.120
That's so rad.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.120
One Way.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.240
That's the song we got to get Loki to play.

42:13.240 --> 42:17.520
One Way or Another by Blondie, Groove is in the Heart by Delight, Girls Just Want to Have

42:17.520 --> 42:22.360
Fun, Cyndi Lauper, Get the Party Started by P!nk, Fergalicious by Fergie.

42:22.360 --> 42:23.760
There's another Loki song.

42:23.760 --> 42:31.080
YMCA by the Village People, Can't Touch This by MC Hammer, SOS by Rihanna, Oops I Did It

42:31.080 --> 42:32.360
Again by Britney Spears.

42:32.360 --> 42:37.920
It's a pretty fun list that brings across all generations there, so very cool.

42:37.920 --> 42:44.440
If you want to see the full list, it's there at ea.com slash ea-tracks.

42:44.440 --> 42:48.560
Another game coming out from EA, Rock Band.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.560
Should be pretty interesting.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.560
They announced some tracks at E3.

42:53.560 --> 43:01.640
Let's see, we've got The Who with Won't Get Fooled Again, Mountain with Mississippi Queen,

43:01.640 --> 43:10.960
David Bowie, Looks Like a Suffragette City, Black Sabbath Paranoid, Blue Oyster Cult Don't

43:10.960 --> 43:22.280
Fear the Reaper, The Ramones, Rockaway Beach, Rush with Tom Sawyer, Bon Jovi with Wanted

43:22.280 --> 43:33.520
Dead or Alive, Nirvana in Bloom, Stone Temple Pilots Vaseline, Weezer Say It Ain't So, Foo

43:33.520 --> 43:42.040
Fighters Learn to Fly, Metallica Enter Sandman, The Hives, Main Offender, The Strokes, Reptilia,

43:42.040 --> 43:44.680
and Queens of the Stone Age Go with Flow.

43:44.680 --> 43:49.600
Now I heard in this game you'll be able to use the microphone as claps or a tambourine,

43:49.600 --> 43:55.040
so I demand this mix have Stevie Nicks somewhere in it, Fleetwood Mac, whatever you have to

43:55.040 --> 43:56.040
do to do it.

43:56.040 --> 43:59.860
But you cannot have a game where you play the tambourine and not represent Miss Stevie

43:59.860 --> 44:02.860
Nicks because that would just be awesome.

44:02.860 --> 44:03.860
All kinds of awesome.

44:03.860 --> 44:06.160
But the sound list sounds pretty neat so far.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.160
It does.

44:07.160 --> 44:10.720
And some other really cool things that they're going to be doing with the download content

44:10.720 --> 44:17.640
is you'll be able to download whole albums at a time when you're playing this game.

44:17.640 --> 44:22.720
One of the albums that they're going to have available is going to be for Metallica, and

44:22.720 --> 44:28.360
I believe they're also announcing the Who's Who's Next album is also going to be available.

44:28.360 --> 44:31.400
Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.760
That has the possibility of being a pretty awesome game.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.960
That's one reason I'm sad I didn't go to E3.

44:36.960 --> 44:37.960
I would have liked to play that.

44:37.960 --> 44:40.640
They also promise new content every week.

44:40.640 --> 44:43.220
For how long?

44:43.220 --> 44:45.760
If it takes off, I'd say probably a year.

44:45.760 --> 44:46.760
For a year?

44:46.760 --> 44:47.760
Oh my gosh.

44:47.760 --> 44:49.200
That's something that could just keep going, though.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.640
I think that's great.

44:50.640 --> 44:52.880
That's going to be very interesting to see what that does.

44:52.880 --> 44:53.880
Quite ambitious.

44:53.880 --> 44:56.320
Harmonix gets it, you guys.

44:56.320 --> 44:57.540
They get it.

44:57.540 --> 44:59.720
Rock Band teams with MTV, I'm sorry.

44:59.720 --> 45:01.640
It's going to take off.

45:01.640 --> 45:05.960
It's kind of interesting to see what's going to happen to Guitar Hero this year because

45:05.960 --> 45:07.640
they've almost got them beat at their own game.

45:07.640 --> 45:12.680
I realize there's a guitar and drum element in this game that makes this...

45:12.680 --> 45:17.720
I hope somehow poppy songs can... because I love poppy songs as well as rock songs.

45:17.720 --> 45:22.840
I hope somehow they can be integrated into this game one way or another.

45:22.840 --> 45:23.840
I don't know.

45:23.840 --> 45:27.540
There's just a weird side of me that would like to be able to sing just the weird songs

45:27.540 --> 45:28.920
you wouldn't expect in this game.

45:28.920 --> 45:32.120
I want Rock Band 2 or whatever to have different instruments.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.120
Yeah.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.120
Rock Band 2 Electric Boogaloo.

45:34.120 --> 45:37.200
Hopefully Rock Band 2 gives us a little more so we can sing different songs.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.640
It would be damn hard to do a keyboard-style thing, though.

45:39.640 --> 45:41.120
Please give me keyboard.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.600
Please give me keyboard.

45:43.600 --> 45:47.340
The format that they have set up for that, I doubt very seriously that would be possible

45:47.340 --> 45:48.340
unless it's like...

45:48.340 --> 45:49.340
I don't care.

45:49.340 --> 45:50.340
...seven keys.

45:50.340 --> 45:51.340
It's USB.

45:51.340 --> 45:52.880
How hard could it be?

45:52.880 --> 45:55.200
I'm talking about screen format.

45:55.200 --> 45:56.200
Oh, screen format.

45:56.200 --> 46:02.880
Yeah, especially when you've got the voice track, guitar, all this other business going

46:02.880 --> 46:05.900
on on the screen and your animation going on.

46:05.900 --> 46:08.240
Doing keyboard mode is not going to be...

46:08.240 --> 46:15.900
I'm trying to think of the way that they have the Guitar Hero-style play going in.

46:15.900 --> 46:17.520
They're not going to be able to do keyboard that way.

46:17.520 --> 46:21.960
They could do it with keyboard mania because you had a full screen.

46:21.960 --> 46:25.000
It was something that you could spread out, something that required the whole screen.

46:25.000 --> 46:29.580
You couldn't have it coming at you and have it lay out to the keyboard format.

46:29.580 --> 46:32.460
Dark Sakura, Destroyer of Dreams, everybody.

46:32.460 --> 46:34.080
I'm just being realistic, Rob.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.080
I understand.

46:35.080 --> 46:38.440
Rob, there is no Easter Bunny.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.280
I hate you.

46:40.280 --> 46:45.240
There was no bunny hanging out at Easter.

46:45.240 --> 46:48.040
Can we please move on?

46:48.040 --> 46:49.040
Yes, please.

46:49.040 --> 46:51.200
Hey, it's my turn, isn't it?

46:51.200 --> 46:52.440
I have good news.

46:52.440 --> 46:58.040
Well, it would be good news if it was still 1991, wouldn't it?

46:58.040 --> 47:00.440
Oh, please read the story now.

47:00.440 --> 47:01.440
I know what's coming.

47:01.440 --> 47:11.680
Which, our curly-haired, top-hat-wearing hero of Guns N' Roses, currently a velvet revolver,

47:11.680 --> 47:13.680
is a boss in Guitar Hero 3.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.120
Buckethead is cooler!

47:16.120 --> 47:18.040
I'm done.

47:18.040 --> 47:24.120
I absolutely agree this news would have been ten times cooler in 1991, but it's still kind

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
of cool.

47:25.120 --> 47:29.440
You have to admit, having Slash in the game, that is kind of cool because, you know, those

47:29.440 --> 47:33.200
of us that remember Slash from our high school days are a little bit more grown-up now and

47:33.200 --> 47:37.360
can spend the money on things like Guitar Hero 3, and there is a certain cool factor

47:37.360 --> 47:39.000
to having Slash in the game.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.680
You know, Guitar Hero 3 knows they're going to really have it in for them with this whole

47:42.680 --> 47:47.040
rock band thing coming out, but I think it could be pretty cool.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.900
Again, it all boils down to Songlist for me.

47:49.900 --> 47:53.080
It's almost like this year's lineup, EA has it in for Activision.

47:53.080 --> 47:58.880
I mean, they've got Skate coming out with Tony Hawk's Proving Ground coming out later.

47:58.880 --> 48:05.520
Rock band and, I don't know, I guess with licensed games, you know, The Simpsons and

48:05.520 --> 48:06.520
stuff.

48:06.520 --> 48:11.800
Activision has a lot to lose if they don't innovate.

48:11.800 --> 48:17.960
Could you imagine, though, the kind of Guitar Hero that they would have in 1991, like for

48:17.960 --> 48:18.960
the Nintendo?

48:18.960 --> 48:21.440
Super Nintendo was out at that time.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.160
Something like that, though, would be a Genesis game.

48:23.160 --> 48:25.640
It would be on Sega CD.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.360
I want to say there was something like it, but there really wasn't.

48:27.360 --> 48:30.880
I think the closest thing we had was Chris Cross's Make Your Own Music video.

48:30.880 --> 48:34.680
And then we also had the CD plus G karaoke discs.

48:34.680 --> 48:35.680
Exactly.

48:35.680 --> 48:36.680
Anyway.

48:36.680 --> 48:39.240
I have the Marky Mark 1, Rob.

48:39.240 --> 48:44.520
GK128 says, Fuck Slash, Guitar Hero needs a college rock edition featuring Frank Black

48:44.520 --> 48:46.840
from the Pixies and Jay Mascis from Dinosaur Jr.

48:46.840 --> 48:50.920
I love you, officially.

48:50.920 --> 48:51.920
You know what we need?

48:51.920 --> 48:58.480
We need like late 70s, early 80s rock like Enitho and some Joy Division for me.

48:58.480 --> 48:59.480
That'd be great.

48:59.480 --> 49:00.480
And some Bauhaus.

49:00.480 --> 49:04.520
Well, speaking of music games and going over to Konami, kind of talking about what they're

49:04.520 --> 49:08.880
up to, Supernova 2 was tested this week, and some of the news has been a little bit lost

49:08.880 --> 49:12.400
in the shuffle of all the E3 news, but if you head over to a site like BomaniStyle.com

49:12.400 --> 49:16.320
that dedicates themselves to all the music game news, you can get some of the latest

49:16.320 --> 49:19.600
wrap ups from the fans out there playing the location test.

49:19.600 --> 49:22.480
And the whole list of those extra songs that are in the game has shown up.

49:22.480 --> 49:27.340
There's some interesting covers in it, including Come Clean, which if I remember right was

49:27.340 --> 49:30.520
like a Hilary Duff song, I think.

49:30.520 --> 49:33.400
One of those little girls from the Disney Channel.

49:33.400 --> 49:37.120
Faint, which if I'm not mistaken is a Linkin Park cover, is in there.

49:37.120 --> 49:38.120
That should be interesting.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.120
Waiting for Tonight.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.300
Me Against the Music.

49:40.300 --> 49:41.960
Some interesting covers there.

49:41.960 --> 49:45.440
It's very interesting that Konami sticks with all these covers, not the real things.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.440
I don't know.

49:46.440 --> 49:50.200
Well, anyway, some other reports that come in from the updates.

49:50.200 --> 49:54.560
Marvelous ratings in Supernova 2 don't seem to award more points than perfects, and for

49:54.560 --> 49:58.200
some reason seemed easier to obtain than usual.

49:58.200 --> 50:02.440
Strings of perfect ratings will by no means hamper a great song rating.

50:02.440 --> 50:08.520
Konami finally has spelled Marvelous the right way, with one L, and it's a solid silver

50:08.520 --> 50:09.520
color.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.520
Let's see.

50:10.520 --> 50:14.080
If a player is able to receive all perfects or better, the triple A rating on the results

50:14.080 --> 50:17.240
screen will feature the text, full perfect combo.

50:17.240 --> 50:18.680
Interesting.

50:18.680 --> 50:19.680
Some other news there.

50:19.680 --> 50:24.680
There's an extra stage that has a background video with Black Roses, people and other things

50:24.680 --> 50:25.680
that are going on.

50:25.680 --> 50:28.160
I guess the song is called Unreal.

50:28.160 --> 50:30.680
There's an introduction video to DDR Has Returned.

50:30.680 --> 50:32.460
There hasn't been one of those in a little while.

50:32.460 --> 50:35.600
They say since 4th Mix there.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.440
But they say some of the songs feel a little off sync.

50:38.440 --> 50:42.600
People were complaining that some of the older songs from DDR Extreme and DDR Supernova didn't

50:42.600 --> 50:43.600
feel quite right.

50:43.600 --> 50:46.240
It wasn't off sync by much, but they were bitching it was off sync.

50:46.240 --> 50:49.520
It should also be noted that they were also bitching that the pads being used on the location

50:49.520 --> 50:54.400
test machine were not perfect, which might be a good point to reiterate that maybe it's

50:54.400 --> 50:58.960
time for Konami to come out with some new pads that are a little better with the technology

50:58.960 --> 50:59.960
that's a little newer.

50:59.960 --> 51:06.600
Not to mention, if you guys remember the original Supernova Beta test, same issues, that stuff

51:06.600 --> 51:07.600
was off sync.

51:07.600 --> 51:11.260
It's just because it's a test.

51:11.260 --> 51:14.720
Gerardimo says Me Against the Music by Helen is better than the original.

51:14.720 --> 51:18.240
Gerardimo also says that that actually was not the extra stage.

51:18.240 --> 51:19.840
I guess there's a little bit of confusion going on there.

51:19.840 --> 51:23.240
I did hear that there was actually a song called No that was the extra stage, and there

51:23.240 --> 51:26.360
was one other one, I think, called Kano or something as well.

51:26.360 --> 51:32.080
Let's see, Black Wolf says only in DDR is perfect and not good enough.

51:32.080 --> 51:34.760
Nice.

51:34.760 --> 51:39.600
For DDR fans who are looking to get back into arcades, also the rumor is EMUs is coming

51:39.600 --> 51:43.580
with Supernova 2, which you might remember from the Japanese Bomani games, it never really

51:43.580 --> 51:47.840
came over here, but the rumor is the test machine had the EMUs set up on it.

51:47.840 --> 51:49.840
So that's kind of interesting.

51:49.840 --> 51:50.840
We'll see where that goes.

51:50.840 --> 51:54.120
It could make up for lack of memory cards.

51:54.120 --> 51:56.120
Maybe.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.120
Hopefully.

51:58.120 --> 52:01.480
I don't know.

52:01.480 --> 52:04.280
So I don't know.

52:04.280 --> 52:09.560
This is, I guess, cool that there's new content coming out for Guitar Hero 2 for the Xbox

52:09.560 --> 52:18.040
360, and the new pack actually is going to have a few more songs in there, but at the

52:18.040 --> 52:24.360
same time, I want to be sedated, smoke on the water, and you've got another thing coming.

52:24.360 --> 52:30.080
It's still going to be 500 Microsoft points, or $6.25, and guess what?

52:30.080 --> 52:37.760
Because people that did download it before, the first pack, over 300,000 of you, they

52:37.760 --> 52:41.540
just showed Activision that, guess what?

52:41.540 --> 52:47.000
That price point is still good, so we're not lowering the price.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.380
So if you want them to lower the price, don't buy it.

52:51.380 --> 52:55.380
So in other words, those prices aren't coming down anytime soon because too many people

52:55.380 --> 52:58.120
actually supported the old packs, even though we told them not to.

52:58.120 --> 52:59.120
Yes.

52:59.120 --> 53:02.220
Well, I don't know about you guys, but that news that the prices are not coming down for

53:02.220 --> 53:06.600
this old shit from Guitar Hero 1 makes me a little bit angsty, and you know what that

53:06.600 --> 53:17.860
means.

53:17.860 --> 53:19.160
Time for the FUs of the week.

53:19.160 --> 53:24.160
Dark Sakura, please do us the honors and start us off.

53:24.160 --> 53:29.720
My FU goes to my stomach, because I haven't, well, technically myself I should say, because

53:29.720 --> 53:38.200
I haven't put anything in it since 12 o'clock today, and I'm very hungry.

53:38.200 --> 53:44.000
So FU on the human dependency on food for sustenance.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
Loki.

53:45.000 --> 53:52.840
You know, I was going to have something petty to complain about, but I just realized something.

53:52.840 --> 53:58.080
DDR hasn't had another download pack since the launch of the fucking universe game.

53:58.080 --> 53:59.480
Where the fuck are the downloads?

53:59.480 --> 54:03.760
Shit, universe 2 is right around the corner, where the hell is my goddamn downloads for

54:03.760 --> 54:04.760
universe 1?

54:04.760 --> 54:09.800
Or did you just forget to do that, kind of like the carry of your revolution pen discs?

54:09.800 --> 54:10.800
Want to know my theory?

54:10.800 --> 54:15.280
They ain't coming because the song packs were all already on the disc, and that's all they

54:15.280 --> 54:16.280
made.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.760
That's my theory.

54:18.760 --> 54:20.400
Fuck them for that.

54:20.400 --> 54:23.400
That's it.

54:23.400 --> 54:26.320
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I have to move in two weeks and I still don't

54:26.320 --> 54:28.320
have a place to live.

54:28.320 --> 54:32.640
That's a little bit frustrating, but hopefully all will be better very soon and I'll have

54:32.640 --> 54:37.360
a place, because that would be nice, because otherwise I'm going to cry.

54:37.360 --> 54:41.320
Let's move on to some other news.

54:41.320 --> 54:44.320
Now we're going to get into some news that, you know, some other things picked up around

54:44.320 --> 54:45.320
this week.

54:45.320 --> 54:47.760
Not necessarily at E3, but some of them are, some of them aren't.

54:47.760 --> 54:48.760
Dark Soccer?

54:48.760 --> 54:53.600
Well, there is some other stuff.

54:53.600 --> 54:59.840
Disney has actually purchased War Inspector, their Junction Point Studios, so now we'll

54:59.840 --> 55:12.280
be getting some new games and Disney is going to have some stuff coming to the new consoles.

55:12.280 --> 55:24.200
War Inspector brought us the Deus Ex, Thief, Deadly Shadows, System Shock.

55:24.200 --> 55:25.720
I really don't know how to feel about this.

55:25.720 --> 55:32.280
I'm hoping that it's going to be good for getting the new games, and I mean, maybe it'll

55:32.280 --> 55:36.840
mean that we get a Tron game, can I beg?

55:36.840 --> 55:39.720
Besides the old recycled ones we're getting on Xbox Live?

55:39.720 --> 55:40.720
Seriously.

55:40.720 --> 55:45.120
Well, there's a quote on here saying, War Inspector's unique talents as leading creative

55:45.120 --> 55:50.520
forces in the world of video games, his knowledge and passion for Disney, his legacy of storytelling

55:50.520 --> 55:54.960
and character development adds a unique creative dimension to our portfolio, and it's from

55:54.960 --> 55:59.400
the Executive VP of Disney Interactive.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.920
So maybe, maybe we'll get some good.

56:01.920 --> 56:04.980
Well, Disney's been up to a lot of wheeling and dealing lately.

56:04.980 --> 56:11.080
They at E3 announced a new online service that will be on all of their DS titles.

56:11.080 --> 56:15.480
It's called D Gamer, and it's going to be first in the Chronicles of Narnia game that's

56:15.480 --> 56:19.520
coming out for the DS, and basically what D Gamer's going to do is it's going to turn

56:19.520 --> 56:23.440
your Nintendo DS into Xbox Live of sorts.

56:23.440 --> 56:28.440
There will be avatars, you can chat with other people, and you can look at the achievements

56:28.440 --> 56:30.600
that your friends have unlocked.

56:30.600 --> 56:33.600
Interesting that it took a third party to do this.

56:33.600 --> 56:38.040
So the system is more than capable of handling this type of technology, it's just that Nintendo

56:38.040 --> 56:39.920
doesn't want to do it.

56:39.920 --> 56:45.360
Interesting, and interesting that somebody has decided to step up and do it, if not just

56:45.360 --> 56:46.360
for their own games.

56:46.360 --> 56:50.960
But let's face it, there's a certain audience that gets a lot of these Disney games that

56:50.960 --> 56:55.080
come out, you know, the Hannah Montana games and the That's So Raven game, that will benefit

56:55.080 --> 56:59.480
from this, whereas the rest of us hardcore gamers that are too cool to go out and buy

56:59.480 --> 57:04.520
a Chronicles of Narnia video game, are going to be sitting here going, gosh, I wish I had

57:04.520 --> 57:09.560
something like that when I was playing, you know, the games I'm playing, like Pokemon,

57:09.560 --> 57:11.760
even though that's not much cooler.

57:11.760 --> 57:12.760
Anyway.

57:12.760 --> 57:17.960
Because Rob really likes Hannah Montana.

57:17.960 --> 57:18.960
Sad.

57:18.960 --> 57:25.560
Another disappointment, well, still rumors that the 6-axis controller is going to be

57:25.560 --> 57:31.000
rumbling soon, in fact, it's been confirmed by a few different places, one of which is

57:31.000 --> 57:38.460
supposedly a Sony employee, apparently, I guess, Sony employee confirmed directly to

57:38.460 --> 57:42.560
Kotaku that the 6-axis will be rumbling soon.

57:42.560 --> 57:48.920
Of course, shortly afterwards, immersion comes out saying, hey, we're making a TouchSense

57:48.920 --> 57:53.540
rumble controller for the Playstation 3 in September.

57:53.540 --> 57:58.700
So if a third-party company is making it for the Playstation 3 in September, because why

57:58.700 --> 58:03.680
the hell would you add rumble to your controllers if, I don't know, there wasn't rumble coming,

58:03.680 --> 58:08.800
because that would be kind of stupid, I don't know, that's very interesting.

58:08.800 --> 58:14.840
But Sony is still denying it, saying, hey, yeah, it's not coming, you know, this is all

58:14.840 --> 58:19.160
rumor, blah blah blah blah, but then again, last week, they were also saying, hey, we

58:19.160 --> 58:25.400
have no plans on cutting the Playstation 3 price, or, you know, hey, the 60-gig system

58:25.400 --> 58:28.520
is going to be $4.99 and we're going to be still producing them, you know, that kind

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
of stuff.

58:29.520 --> 58:36.240
Let me put it this way, rumble isn't so last gen after all, oh yeah, exactly, I'm going

58:36.240 --> 58:39.600
to take a wild guess and say it's probably coming this fall.

58:39.600 --> 58:44.200
And so when you buy your Playstation 3 systems, guess what, you get to buy new controllers,

58:44.200 --> 58:47.520
much like the Playstation 1, if you remember.

58:47.520 --> 58:52.000
Devil's advocate, could the rumble in these controllers be for the backwards compatible

58:52.000 --> 58:53.580
games?

58:53.580 --> 58:58.520
It would be weird to see them, it could possibly, I guess, for that, but right now, as far as

58:58.520 --> 59:04.560
I'm aware, I don't think the rumble, like, stuff is in there, I don't know.

59:04.560 --> 59:08.160
I guess it's possible, it just, but they'd be kind of weird to buy a controller just

59:08.160 --> 59:09.840
for the backwards compatible games.

59:09.840 --> 59:12.840
Yeah, because that would imply that somebody bought a Playstation 3, you would totally

59:12.840 --> 59:16.120
skip the Playstation 2, and I can't think that that's a very large audience.

59:16.120 --> 59:20.240
And I can't imagine that that, like, programming or whatever would be built into the emulation

59:20.240 --> 59:28.200
either, you know what I mean, so, I don't know, it'd be an interesting theory, but I

59:28.200 --> 59:29.200
think it's coming.

59:29.200 --> 59:33.520
Alright, well we shall see what Sony does in the upcoming months.

59:33.520 --> 59:38.680
Sony's going to eat crayon pie is what they're going to do, well, except this, this is redemption

59:38.680 --> 59:50.360
I think, they did a point that hinted to a coming of something, ok, I'm just going to

59:50.360 --> 59:55.720
say it, Silent Hill 5 has been announced for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, which I'll

59:55.720 --> 01:00:00.640
probably get it on PS3, I'm happy.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.800
Oh my god, that's such a surprise, a Silent Hill game coming soon!

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.800
It is Silent Hill 5 and I don't care, so, gimme.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:13.280
Here we go though, how would you feel, now we all know that Akira Yomoka is doing the

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.400
music and that's all sorts of rad because that's some of the best part of the Silent

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.080
Hill games, but Dark Sakura, how would your inner fangirl feel if I told you that Silent

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:25.820
Hill 5 is not being developed by Team Silent, but in fact is being developed by the team

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:30.480
that brought you Mark Echo's Getting Up and the first Buffy the Vampire Slayer game on

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480
the Xbox.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.640
The first Buffy game was really good.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.880
Alright, so your inner fangirl may give this a chance?

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.840
As long as my man does the music.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:44.560
Alright, yeah, so Akira Yomoka, they did announce is doing the music, so, alright, there you

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.560
go.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.100
That's too much metal for one hand.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.720
There was lots of Silent Hill news this week, because you know, Origins looks like they've

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.480
completely redone it from the time you and I saw it.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.840
Yeah, it actually looks really good now.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.360
That's why it's getting pushed back from the end of last year.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.360
Thank god, see, you know.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.080
They completely redid that stuff, and then of course Silent Hill Arcade, which I had

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.560
my fangasm over in part A. Seriously, if you haven't seen the videos, it's so rad.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.120
I don't want to spoil what happens, but like the battle with Pyramid Head ends in like

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.920
the raddest way.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.640
Oh my god, like, fangasm all over.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.640
It's awesome.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.400
And yes, I am a fanboy for Pyramid Head and Silent Hill, I will admit it.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:28.200
Anyhow, I'm also a fanboy for price drops, and I was kind of hoping, like many of you,

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.760
that Microsoft would announce one this week at E3.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.760
Well, you know what?

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:38.480
There was an interview from 1UP with Shane Kim, and they were talking to him.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.700
He's of course the corporate VP at Microsoft Game Studios.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:46.760
They were asking him about the whole, you know, what does Xbox 360 need to win, and

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.520
where's the price drop?

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:55.320
Well, Shane Kim doesn't completely count out a price drop.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.200
In fact, he says, stay tuned.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.600
We didn't announce anything here.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600
Didn't feel the need to.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.360
July is a very odd time to announce a price reduction.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:06.960
I'm not even sure Sony announced a price reduction anyway, because, you know, the whole bait

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.080
and switch thing going on.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.060
So they said we didn't feel the need to do it at E3.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.620
So they're not cutting it out of the picture.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.040
It might just not be, you know, coming for a little while, kind of like was speculated

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.360
earlier in the show.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.040
So very interesting.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:29.720
Of course, I should say there's a huge rumor going around about the August 1st price drop.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.720
I don't know.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.720
That seems a little soon.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.360
If they were going to do it then, they might as well have announced it at PlayStation 3.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.880
Black Wolf has an interesting thought.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.320
He says they might announce it at Penny Arcade Expo.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.320
They might announce it.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.320
Take it directly to the fans.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.320
They'll love it.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.360
Announce it at PAX or now there's X07, you know.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.640
I heard they canceled it.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.640
Oh, well.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640
No, no, no.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:54.120
I'm thinking of their event over in Europe.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.120
Is that it?

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.120
Yeah, it's X07.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120
I don't think that's happening this year.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.120
Okay, what about Tokyo Game Show then?

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.120
That could be.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120
I don't know.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120
You never know.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.120
They have plenty of time to do it and especially, you know, waiting until closer to Halo and

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.120
stuff.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120
I don't know.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120
I don't think they're in trouble.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:12.160
Another thing I was going to mention real quick though, there was also Capcom was saying

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.200
that they speculate that the PlayStation 3 will drop price again and there's also speculation

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:22.600
that I know Europe was supposed to be getting that 120 gig PlayStation 3 and can you imagine

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.640
if they do the same thing here and so it's going to be every few months or so you're

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.760
going to get price drop, clearance, new system come out.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:40.280
Anyways, so GamePro on top of their game apparently did a little article of seven games that mysteriously

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:46.400
were missing from E3, which is full of inaccuracies, so let's just go down the list, shall we?

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:52.680
Grand Theft Auto IV, God, where was Grand Theft Auto IV other than the PlayStation press

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:58.280
conference, the Xbox press conference, the Take-Two press conference where they did a

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:03.520
walk-through demo of the thing, yeah, it wasn't there.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.480
Spore, no, Spore was there.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.800
They showed off a few more things on it and had a little press demo for it.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.640
God of War III, okay, that wasn't there, I'll give them that.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.180
Let's see what other stuff they're talking about here.

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.480
I'm surprised there was no God of War III, but I guess they always have Heavenly Sword

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.480
on account.

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.480
It's probably so far off in development.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.480
Yeah, true.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.320
So was Halo 3 when they first started cockteasing us with it.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:41.280
I don't know, a new Rainbow Six game, they're like saying the successor to Rainbow Six Vegas,

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.200
I don't know, I mean the last game just came out, what, a few weeks ago, I don't think

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.720
they need to be teasing the new one yet, especially if it goes the way of Splinter Cell Conviction,

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.160
that was another thing out of the Microsoft conference, it's exclusive to Xbox 360.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:01.440
Uh oh, Prince of Persia IV, I don't really think we need a new Prince of Persia game

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:05.760
since we have like kind of Assassin's Creed kind of fills that void there for a little

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.760
bit.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:12.160
Have you seen Prince of Persia games since, you know, what, 1994 at all, ever?

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.360
I don't know, the new ones are okay.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:22.320
Peter Jackson's Halo, I mean, that's just, because they didn't have enough Halo content

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.080
what with the gift cards and the 360 and everything else.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.200
And Final Fantasy XIII, well they announced it wasn't going to be there anyways, so I

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.960
don't know, you know, how about some other stuff, how about, was it that new Rygar game

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.040
that was supposed to be out there, why didn't they show that, because that was pretty cool.

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.680
Where the fuck is Animal Crossing Wii?

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.240
Oh actually, Rygar was Tecmo and I don't believe Tecmo was there, so that's probably why that

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.880
wasn't there.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.200
Where the fuck is Animal Crossing on the Wii?

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.440
It's still being worked on.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.920
Work faster!

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.680
Done by the guy apparently who did the Mii Channel.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:00.400
How much you want to bet there's no Mii support in the game whatsoever, oh the irony.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:05.000
Black Wolf would like to point out there were no console games for Squeenix, it was all

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.520
DS and PSP, so nothing on the console.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.240
Where the hell is that Final Fantasy game on the Wii then?

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.800
Wasn't there a Crystal Chronicles game coming out at launch?

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.800
Hello?

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.360
What happened?

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.880
Where's the Dragon Quest slashy slash game?

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.160
Who cares about Crystal Chronicles?

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.400
I think Crystal Chronicles, I don't know, I've seen their fall lineup so far and it's

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.260
all DS and PSP games.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:30.360
Very interesting, that's all.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:36.480
Okay, well, that's about all we have to say on this year's E3 and all the stories.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.040
We'll get into some last minute stories in just a little bit, but we are going to open

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.240
up the Skype line if you wish to give us a call.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:49.240
The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.720
We always encourage folks to interact with us, whether it be through Skype or phone or

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.720
whatever.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.720
So let's go to the phones, they're already ringing.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.040
I'm coming with my Wii sapper right for you, Loki.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040
Well hello, Bobby Blackpool.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:07.600
Well that's okay, you won't be able to hit me because it's going to suck.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.320
It's just like Princess Leia shooting mode or something.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.880
Yeah, you better hope that the Wii sensor bar can completely read where you're pointing

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880
that damn thing.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:20.480
Well, so you actually got to go to E3, you lucky bastard, how was it?

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:27.920
It was surprisingly very good except for the physical location of everything going on.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:32.800
It was basically, it's like they moved the time waster to something else.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:37.120
Last year and the year before, the time waster was waiting in line to play the games.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.920
This year, the time waster was waiting in traffic to get to your next appointment or

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.680
get to the more games.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:47.840
That's right, because last year we were in Santa Monica because of the whole all games

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.440
arena thing that was going on and driving to E3 was a bitch every day, seriously.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:01.360
Yeah, and I mean the traffic around was really horrible, two miles from all the hotels and

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.960
the show floor and there were no press rooms at the Barker Hanger, so you couldn't get

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.120
on the internet, you couldn't report anything from there.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.660
You had to go back to the Fairmont Hotel, which was probably the farthest hotel away

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:17.000
because that's where the press room was.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.720
So if you were on a line like for the working press, like newspapers and other internet

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:27.140
sites had deadlines, they had to spend a lot of time going back and forth, back and forth

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.560
just so they could do their work.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.160
So the ESA knows that the physical location was really the only downside.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.280
I think if they consolidated it more and still only invited about 3,000 or 4,000 people,

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.240
it'd still be a great show.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.320
Couldn't they just rent one small part of the LA Convention Center or find another?

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.900
I have a hard time believing LA Convention Center is the only place in the area.

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.120
Couldn't they find another convention center in an LA suburb to do it in?

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:58.320
I think Lawrence Young was telling me like Long Beach Convention Center maybe, but LA

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.840
Convention Center is too expensive for what they were trying to do.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.320
It's all about saving the money.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.080
Now Vegas would be great.

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.340
Yeah, Vegas is convention heaven, it'd be awesome.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.680
We could go to E3 and then go see strippers, it would be incredible.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.440
Exactly, but I don't know how many of the game journalists would get sloshed after that

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:21.160
and how well they'd work.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:25.640
All I know is that you're going to have to bring us as your crew next year, Bobby.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.720
That loophole will probably be very close next year.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.200
We shall see what happens.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.480
Maybe they can open it up a little more in Vegas, who knows.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.620
Really quickly, what were your thoughts?

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.120
You got to walk the show floor.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.260
What impressed the hell out of you?

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.600
What disappointed the hell out of you?

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.440
What impressed me was Burnout Paradise.

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:47.320
In fact, on my show, since it's not your five-year anniversary, I'm going to plug my show.

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.320
That's fine.

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.320
It's a podcast.

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.320
You might as well say it.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.560
I interviewed the producer for Burnout Paradise.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.920
They're really doing some really interesting things with the online multiplayer and they

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:01.960
have added enough to the game itself that it's going to be a great game for communities

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:02.960
to play.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.520
It's going to be a great game to play online.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.720
I'm really hyped for Burnout Paradise.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.920
I was already hyped for Burnout before you said that.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.920
Now I'm even more hyped.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.440
That's great.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.360
They're doing seamless online multiplayer.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360
There's no lobby.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.240
It's an open world and people just drop in on the open world and the host says, hey,

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.240
you want to race?

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.240
Yeah.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.240
Okay.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.240
Boom.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.240
He starts the race.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.240
It's like Test Drive Unlimited.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240
It's crashing.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240
Right.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240
Rad.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.220
Now, Rock Band.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:33.920
Let's talk a little bit about Rock Band because I did get to play it.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.920
I played it four times on the drums just to make sure that all my rants about the drum

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.920
peripheral were founded or unfounded or whatever.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:47.760
I still don't like the placement of the pads.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.720
Everything else is fine and it does feel like you're playing a drum set except for the

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.200
fact that your arms are in the wrong place.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.200
Interesting.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:01.840
Now, the thing is I was the only one there who had a problem with the drum set because

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.820
the harmonics people and the MTV people, which were extremely nice to me, they were very

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.200
receptive to me, they're like, oh, you're a drummer.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.040
Yeah, you like that drum peripheral, huh?

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040
Yeah, it's awesome, isn't it?

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.760
I go, not really.

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.520
They're like, what?

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.580
Good for you.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:19.480
I talked to the marketing manager at EA.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.920
I talked to a guy who works for MTV.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.920
I talked to one of the harmonics developers and I said, you know, the pads are great.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:25.920
The hardware is great.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.160
The UI is fine.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.080
The placement sucks of the pads.

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.960
I heard that they were adjustable though.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.240
Well, it's not just that.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:39.180
It's the fact that the note chart has the high hat on the second drum from the left

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:43.480
and usually you have to cross your arms for that.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:49.400
My biggest issue was the far right drum, which they used as the symbol a lot of times.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.440
All the drums could change at any time.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:56.240
They weren't really married to one thing, but having to pull back on your arm instead

01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.060
of go forward, which is the natural motion of your arm, that took a while to get used

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.920
to and so I would overshoot the pad all the time.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:08.320
Also, they have the Xbox guide button right in the center and I hit it like three times

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.200
bringing up the guide while playing.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.600
You pulled the Peter Moore.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.600
I did.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.880
I pulled the Peter Moore three times and the game didn't pause.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.080
Notes were still going up and the guide had come up, but it's a pre-alpha thing.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:27.720
That'll be fixed, but I played two games on medium with the drum set, two games on hard

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:33.360
and even electronic arts people were coming over to watch me play Tom Sawyer on hard because

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.640
I wasn't failing it.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.560
You have good taste in song choices too.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.560
Yes.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.560
Nobody else wanted to do it.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.300
They're like, I don't want to sing that high and so finally one of the harmonics chicks

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.560
was like, I'll sing Tom Sawyer.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.000
Come on, let's go.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.280
It was fun.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:54.080
I will still get it because I'm a whore for that stuff, but I still don't like the placement

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:57.640
and I'm going to be very vocal about the placement of the pads.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.280
Let me ask you real quick, I don't want to take up too much time, but since you were there,

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.080
I do want to pick your brain on some of these things.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.840
How did it compare to last year's E3 and how did it seem to be received by the audience

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.880
as a whole?

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.340
Were people enjoying the fact that it was more of an exclusive event or did people miss

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:18.480
the glitz and glamour in the booth babes of yonder past?

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:25.080
Everybody I spoke to that attended E3 loved the new E3.

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:30.200
The people who didn't like E3, some of them had good reasons.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:35.600
The more indie games scene, they didn't like it because they were shut out.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.200
They kind of used the lack of the booth babes, the lack of the glitz as part of it, but really

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.440
it was about they couldn't be a part of it.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.500
They were not invited to even exhibit.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:49.560
The ESA wouldn't even let them there, but everybody that was there loved the fact that

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.340
you could have a conversation with people on the show floor.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.160
You could walk up to anything and play it.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.760
Square Enix might not have liked it because every time I walked by their set of kiosks,

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:06.280
nobody was playing the games, but other than that, everybody loved it except for the physical

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.240
distance between things.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.600
I missed a few appointments because I couldn't get there in time.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.300
I did not get to see Fallout 3 because I was 20 minutes late because of traffic.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.800
Question from Rob D in chat.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:22.340
Ask Bobby if he thinks that E3 can stay alive this way.

01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:26.740
I think it did its job.

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:28.860
It did its job admirably.

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:34.340
Whether the ESA will actually continue doing it in this way, that I don't know.

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:40.020
I don't know if they made enough money doing it this way or not.

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:41.020
Very interesting.

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:44.920
Anyone else have a question for Bobby who got to go there and actually be at E3?

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:50.020
I guess it was kind of bad that I didn't accept my invite.

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.880
You could have had a cameraman and a sound guy.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.640
Damn it.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.920
He's making pouty face at Jamie right now.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.840
I wish we were a TV show.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.160
However, I did get to sleep a lot, so that was good.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.160
Not really, I had to work.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.960
Yeah, and the day when you all were at E3, I was on jury duty, so I had one of the websites

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.880
mobile version on refresh on my cell phone to follow the press conferences.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.340
It was sad and pathetic.

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.640
That was my E3.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.280
I did that at work.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:23.000
I actually left my desk to the open computer and sat there and watched the streaming Nintendo

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.200
conference because no one really pays attention to what I do.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.640
What would you say to the folks, because I've heard a lot of folks that didn't go to E3

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.840
say worst E3 ever.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.160
Is that true?

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.640
They'd only say that because it didn't have the glitz, it didn't have the glamour, and

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.000
really to be honest, the press conferences, everybody surrendered.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.040
Usually E3 is about who had the best press conference, and all of them said, we don't

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.660
want the best press conference this year.

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:53.880
They're not going for that.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:58.600
That might be where a part of that came from, but no, in terms of seeing things, getting

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:04.560
things done, getting contacts, networking, all that stuff, this E3 was the best out of

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.280
the 11 that I went to.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:10.000
I even said that on the Xbox Life Marketplace video that I'm apparently all over.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.200
I was going to say a perfect example of that would have been the Konami press conference

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:21.200
where it's like, yeah, two DDRs, Silent Hill 5, go get your press kit.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.000
What's up with that, Bobby?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.760
Now since there are less people at E3, you have a bigger chance of being a media whore,

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.800
and Bobby, you really got some media whoring done this year.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.240
I understand you're on a banner ad for game trailers.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.920
What video on Xbox Life Marketplace are you on?

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:48.940
The On10.net E3 show floor wrap-up video, because I was with the TV channel that should

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:52.200
be renamed Nameless, and I was with all games even before then.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.240
I've known Laura Foy for many, many years, so when she saw me in the empty square on

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:01.000
Wednesday, she came over and asked me a few questions, and apparently we have more air

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.440
time than a frag doll on this thing.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.440
But I was on that.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.520
MTV Latin America made me sign a waiver because they filmed me playing Tom Sawyer on the drums.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.460
And then Hudson, their video crew, the same ones that made the Bomberman video that's

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:19.720
on YouTube that says, Act Zero sucked ass and we know it.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.940
They came around and did something, and it was really stupid.

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.800
If they used my thing, the question was, it was this chick, and she goes, okay, here's

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.060
the question, games or girls?

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:35.040
And I look at her, because it's the most absurd question I've ever heard in my life, coming

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.680
out of something like that, but it's going to come across as, he's actually thinking

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.720
games or girls, oh my God.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.160
You got to love creative editing.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.280
Rob D says a great summary here, for not getting invited to E3, Bobby did a good job of being

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.280
at E3.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.400
Yeah, that loophole ruled.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.640
Excellent job of being an E3 stowaway, that's up to you.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.720
I would have answered back to her, if you're talking about Act Zero, I'll take girls for

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.720
sure.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:12.240
No, I think my response was, games have pause buttons.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.960
Our soccer, I can't rebuttal.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.560
Yeah, I have something that involves a butt and my foot kicking in.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.280
Or even better, you just go, what, you're offering?

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.280
Heart, Bobby.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.160
All right, well, Bobby, thanks so much for the call and for the perspective from someone

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.580
who was actually there, and congrats on, I'm sure, what was going to end up being a lot

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:33.840
of exposure for you and your show and all that good stuff, so congratulations.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.520
Yeah, thank you.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.360
All right, until next time, my friend.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.360
Yep.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.360
All right, later.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.360
See you.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.360
Bye.

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.360
All right.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.360
Very good call.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.360
We always like hearing from Bobby.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.360
More calls, please.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.040
Who's this?

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.920
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:54.000
This is a guy who's disappeared for far too long.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.080
Ah, is this VX JasonXV?

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.080
That would be me.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.000
Howdy, how are you?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.600
I'm busy and chilling in Colorado in more ways than one.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.560
But our website is still up, despite all of that, so you are the best webmaster in the

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.920
world, and I hope you heard our shout-out in the five-year anniversary special.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.920
I listened to the whole thing while I was working way too many damn hours at work.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:19.920
Well done.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:20.920
So, what's up?

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.520
What do we owe this call to tonight?

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:28.200
Belated happy birthday to Orange Lounge Radio, belated happy birthday to you, Rob, and belated

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.940
happy birthday to myself, because I am a whore for that kind of stuff.

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:32.940
Thank you.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:33.940
Where's my present?

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:34.940
I don't know.

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:35.940
Where's mine?

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.940
All right, fair enough.

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:41.400
So, for real reason, Ace Combat 6.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400
Holy cow.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.440
Ah, here's the game we didn't talk about yet.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.560
Yeah, no kidding.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:53.960
The last Monday, I do believe it is, I got a new monitor for my birthday, and I have

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.720
a nice little consolidation thing going on, because it's my computer monitor for two different

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:03.560
computers as well as my Xbox 360 screen, and it does high-definition.

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:08.520
So I'm finally running my 360 in 720p, and a lot of things are looking a hell of a lot

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.960
better than standard component.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:18.400
And I finally managed to get a hold of the demo from the E3 category, and I played it,

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.000
and holy cow, that game looks beautiful.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.960
I don't know if it's satellite imagery, high-resolution satellite imagery, or low-level aircraft imagery

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.320
of the landscapes, but oh, man, they're doing a beautiful job with that.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:37.760
That game was so fun just to look at, and it played so well still.

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:43.200
I've loved that series ever since Air Combat on the PlayStation.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.960
Why you're making me want to go check it out myself, even though I'm not usually into the

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.240
flying games, so...

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.520
I don't like simulations like Flight Simulator.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:56.280
I love arcade-style games, and Air Combat and Ace Combat have always been that, and

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.880
they are doing a good job continuing the series.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.200
Like old-school After Burner, right?

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.200
Yeah.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:08.120
It's not as free, it's kind of teetering towards the more realistic flying, but still arcade

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.120
dogfighting.

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.120
It's fun.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:14.000
I don't have anything else to say, I am buying that game the day it comes out.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.960
Well thank you for bringing up a game we neglected to bring up earlier in the show.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.200
Yeah, shame on you guys.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.200
Oh, sorry.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.880
You know, there's just so damn much that comes out of E3, that's why we rely on you guys

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:22.880
to help us out.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.880
Yeah.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:29.920
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.080
Anything else out of E3 got you excited?

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.360
I watched a couple of the trailers, Skate looks pretty boring, but I think that goes

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.680
back to the whole simulation vs. arcade thing.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:42.680
The project...

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:43.680
Prove yourself!

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.680
Crap.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.680
Tony Hawk game.

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.600
Tony Hawk's Proving Ground.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.600
Proving Ground, thank you!

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:52.300
I'm mixing all those words up.

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:56.640
Proving Ground seems to be going right down the same path, again, expanding on a few more

01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:02.160
elements, and it looks like it's a very true-to-form continuation of the series.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.160
What else did I look at?

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:08.920
Beautiful Katamari told me absolutely nothing new, but I don't know yet whether I'm going

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.640
to like it if it's the same thing all over again or not.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:16.840
The music was kind of, I don't know how to describe it, but the music is kind of making

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:23.680
me teeter on the side that I might not be caring for that game too much.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:28.160
Bomberman Live, oh man, I haven't played a Bomberman game in forever.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:34.040
The trailers and all of the media that Microsoft posted was really fun to look at, and hopefully

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.200
the rest of the year and into the first half of the next year when all this stuff is going

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.400
to really all be coming out is going to not be too much of a drain on my banking account,

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.400
but you know.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.380
Jason, I know you've been a music game fan for a long time, obviously, because you've

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:51.880
been with OLR for a long time, and Act Deaf brings up a very interesting question in chat.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:57.120
I wonder if Jason will talk about Rock Band, what do you think about Rock Band?

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:01.360
We went over this over a little bit in the forums, so all you people who aren't a part,

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360
go read.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:06.240
It's always great to do that in between shows.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:12.860
The aesthetics of cramming everything in for multiple person play seems to be really, really

01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:13.960
off.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:18.600
The lyrics are probably going to be the most underused portion of that game, and for good

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:24.320
reason, less people sing than sit there and play a guitar or a drum or anything else.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.440
I don't really know too much about the drum, four versus five is kind of funny, you know,

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:32.960
Guitar Hero goes to five while Guitar Freaks is three, the drum peripheral is going to

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.840
be four while Drummania was five.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:42.180
I didn't like, I've never liked console Drummania, I'll play it because I like Drummania in general,

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:47.560
but I've played the arcade version of MGL, console version wasn't very faithful, I don't

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.680
like cramming my arms that close together.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.880
What Bobby was saying was just kind of driving that point home again.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:24:01.940
Bass, I don't know, I don't think I've got enough hands on with it on Guitar Hero 2,

01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:04.680
but the vocals are going to be the lowest point.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:08.200
Other than that, I'm still recognizing a couple of the songs, which makes me happy enough

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:12.720
that I'll actually have something to play, and it looks like it's going to be fun.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:16.320
For a game that's changing companies, it looks like it's still going down a very good path

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.400
for the general make-up and play of the game.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.280
And fun is really what it's all about, right?

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.280
Hell yeah.

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.680
Good music, good game.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.680
All right.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.160
Well, Jason, we've got to let you go to get probably about one more call in here, but

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.040
thanks so much for the call, we appreciate it, okay?

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.040
Yep.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.040
All right, take care, buddy.

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.040
See you guys.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.040
Bye.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.880
All right, we always appreciate Jason when he gives us a call.

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.440
We'll do about one more call, I know we've got a lot of people trying to get through

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.520
tonight, but we also want to wrap up pretty soon here, so let's do at least one more call.

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:45.600
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.600
It's GS68.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.600
Hi, GS68.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.600
What's on your mind?

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:55.520
Basically, I read about Ghost Squad coming out for the Wii, and it just reminded me about

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.720
the arcade version.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.960
I'm sorry, you heard about what coming out for the Wii?

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960
Ghost Squad for the Wii.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.520
Oh, okay.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.600
And one thing that's always bugging me about the arcade version is that I went to the Philippines,

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:14.960
and most of the Ghost Squad machines there have card slots, but here in California, none

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:20.400
of the machines have card slots, so I can only go up to level four on the machines,

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:31.440
and I don't get a whole lot of stuff as much as on the card slots and machines.

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:36.000
I'm sorry, you cut out a little bit there, so I'm sorry, what was the question out of

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
that?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:48.120
One thing that's bugging me about the arcade game is that in the U.S., none of the machines

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:55.000
in the U.S. have card slots, but if I go to any other country with that game, the machines

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
usually have card slots.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:05.120
I went to the Philippines earlier this year, and most of their machines there had card

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:13.840
slots, and I get to have more levels and features and stuff, and I'm just wondering, for games

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:23.400
like that, and why don't, oh, sorry.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:29.100
I think if you're talking about as far as the arcade scene goes, and why is it that

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:35.120
they have the cards in some places and not in others, I think it just has to do with

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.320
the arcade scene in general here.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.840
I don't think there's enough of a scene to support that type of technology here, and

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.680
obviously Konami and DDR is one thing that comes to my mind like that, and everything

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.040
they're doing with EMUs overseas and things.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.920
I think it's just that Japanese has more of an arcade culture that supports that, whereas

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:54.700
here, it's all about the tickets, and taking in the tickets and redeeming them for cash

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:55.700
and prizes.

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:56.700
You know what I mean?

01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:03.160
Yeah, I look at Asian arcades, and they have a lot of cool stuff, like...

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.880
Like Pachinko, which they don't have here.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.880
Yeah, and...

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.520
There are Pachinko places in the US, by the way.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.400
But it's not the Nor- it's a novelty thing here.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.400
I agree.

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:13.400
Yeah.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.680
All right, well, hey, anything you want to share about your thoughts with E3?

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.560
Was there anything that really got you excited about E3?

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:24.280
I didn't really catch- I wasn't really caught up with E3, I didn't read much about it.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.560
Well, hopefully you learned stuff here tonight by listening to the show.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.920
I hope we can educate some folks.

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.400
All right, well, hey, thanks so much for the call, GS68.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.040
We really appreciate it, okay?

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.040
You're welcome.

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.040
All right, take care, buddy.

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.040
You too.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.040
All right.

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:42.360
I think that's going to about do it, because we're running almost an hour 40 for this segment,

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.440
so we really need to switch back over and wrap things up.

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:48.720
So I'm sorry to those calls we didn't get to tonight, but we'll also take more calls

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:49.840
next week, I'm sure.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.160
We always do.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.060
So we're going to go around now and ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio.

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:56.960
Any last minute stories?

01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:59.000
I have a couple, actually.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Go for it.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.080
This is more European news.

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.880
Coming to Xbox Live Arcade, there was Bomberman and Yaya Kung Fu on the 18th.

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:10.000
It'll be out in July.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:18.600
Also the fifth Harry Potter game demo is on Xbox Live Arcade in the UK.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.080
Just for the record, it is out here as well.

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:30.240
All right, but it's actually supposed to take up 2.55% of the 20 gig hard drive, yay.

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.360
And the Lost Planet PC is getting Mega Man.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.360
That's kind of neat.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.600
A Mega Man patch for Lost Planet PC.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:44.400
Does it let you play as Mega Man?

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.320
It actually doesn't say.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.800
It just says some type of Mega Man patch.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.240
I imagine it's probably a suit or something silly.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.240
That's what they need in Dead Rising.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240
It's a character.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240
It's a playable character.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.040
You can play as Joe from Lost Planet, Mega Man, or Frank West from Dead Rising.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.760
Oh, Frank West is awesome.

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:04.520
Yeah, you can get the costume and the gun.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:05.520
Really?

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.520
And you can get the hat.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:07.520
You can get the whole thing in Dead Rising.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.520
Oh, rad.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:14.200
Anyway, if that's it, then Loki, anything you want to share?

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.480
Yeah, there's some interesting stuff.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:21.520
IGN just did their Week in Review podcast, I guess, and one of the things that they mentioned

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.560
is Rock Band coming to the Wii in 2008.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.440
So that's interesting.

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:34.320
Another interesting thing, Cotton, I guess, trailer for Smash Bros. Brawl is, I guess,

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:41.920
Bulbin from the Zelda series is going to be either a trophy assist or assist trophy character

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:43.640
or a playable character.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.640
So that's kind of neat.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.640
Who's this?

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.640
I'm sorry?

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.640
Bulbin.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:53.120
It's like one of those, I don't know if they're elves or what, some sort of enemy

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.120
from the game.

01:29:55.120 --> 01:30:01.440
Anywho, other interesting things, the simple series, one of my favorite things to talk

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:07.560
about, D3's lineup there, they're releasing their first two volumes on the Wii.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:13.600
The first one, Volume 1, looks like a kart racing game, I guess, and the other one looks

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:18.480
like a frog jumping game, so that's kind of interesting.

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.680
Hopefully those make their way out over here at some point.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:27.240
Of course, one thing we can't forget, I know my wife might be looking forward to this,

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:33.440
Nitro Bike was announced for the Wii by Ubisoft and it's being developed by Left Field Productions,

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:39.720
the creators of the classic Excitebike 64, and it's kind of like a, I guess, Excite

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:45.240
Truck but with bikes, so, Excitebike.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:53.320
Some other interesting things, one game we've talked about here before, Tomiki Fighters,

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:59.240
which now is being called Blastworks, which is coming to the Wii later on this year, it's

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:02.080
going to have other games in that as well.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:09.040
Blastworks will not only feature Tomiki Fighters, as well as some other games created by Kent

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:15.720
at show, including Our Rootage, which has been confirmed, and looks like Gunroar and

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.280
Taurus Trooper are also being looked into, and those are other shooter games that he's

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:22.240
developed for free.

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.240
Looks pretty cool.

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:28.240
I think it's only going to be about 30 bucks when it comes out, too.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:32.240
And I believe, yeah, that's it.

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.680
All right, lots of news this week.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.060
It will be hard to top it next week, but of course we'll be back with another episode

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:43.280
of Orange Lounge Radio next week, and maybe catching a lot more of your opinions and fallout

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:47.320
from E3, and I'm sure as we start to kick into the fall months, it's just going to be

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:52.520
oodles and oodles of news as we get into, because now E3 was in July and not May, so

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.600
there's a little less time before the fall rush, so we'll be looking forward to sharing

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.600
that all with you.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:00.320
And speaking of the fall, we hit our 250th episode this fall, if you can believe that,

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.160
so lots of fun stuff in store.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.600
But we're not going to do anything special for it, because we did the 200th show last

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.560
year and the fifth year for the anniversary of this show.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.100
We don't want to celebrate ourselves too much, but it certainly is a milestone that's interesting.

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:14.640
Every day is a celebration.

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:19.560
Every day is a new celebration of life.

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:22.800
So I noticed Loki's watching the Silent Hill arcade videos on YouTube.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.800
It looks nice.

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.800
Doesn't it look hot?

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.800
Did you see the pyramid head thing?

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.680
Watch the beginning of part B. It's awesome.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:33.040
Yeah, I'm watching the beginning of part two right now.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.040
It's in there then.

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.040
You'll see it.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:41.560
Pyramid head goes slice, you're going to die, and then he goes slice, and then right when

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:46.880
it's about to hit the guy's head, it switches back to the day, or whatever you want to call

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:47.880
it.

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.520
I thought you said you weren't spoiling it for our listeners.

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.520
Sorry, I did.

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.520
Rob you meanie bud.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.520
You need to watch it.

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.520
I didn't spoil anything.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.520
It's just awesome.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:56.520
It's about IGN.

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.520
I'll watch it.

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.520
It would be cool, though, if they brought it to the Wii.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:02.760
I mean, it looks like these gun games are going to be taken off, or at least...

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.320
You know, Dan and I had an idea a while back.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:06.840
Point blank, Wii.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:10.760
Hey, you remember the Biohazard Gun Survivor, right?

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:14.960
And we got it over here as Resident Evil Gun Survivor, and they took out the gun support.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.640
You had to play it with the controller.

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:22.640
We were thinking back in the day how with the Dreamcast, you remember the Dreamcast

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:25.360
gun had a controller on it, right?

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.360
Mm-hmm.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:33.640
Couldn't they do something like that with the Wii, use the controller on it to do your

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.200
motion, move back and forth, and then shoot with the gun?

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.680
They could easily do those games.

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.400
I mean, it's kind of what the way they used the range.

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:47.120
In Resident Evil 2 Arcade, you used your actual gun as your direction.

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.120
That was kind of cool, too.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:51.280
And then you got to shoot people dead.

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.900
Here's one other game that came out of E3 I didn't hear any other news on, but there's

01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:57.600
a new Trauma Center game that's going to come out for the Wii, and this one actually supports

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.880
widescreen and looks pretty and has new characters.

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:03.000
I'm very excited about a new Trauma Center game for the Wii, because Trauma Center is

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
awesome.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.880
All right, what are you laughing about?

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:12.200
They should have a game for Silent Hill.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.280
Konami, hear me on this.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.320
I think you've got a hit with this.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:21.760
You know how these sim games and stuff, like pets and dogs and cats and stuff, are all

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:26.560
really popular, they should have a Pyramid Head game, where you take care of Pyramid

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:33.280
Head, or you are Pyramid Head, and you feed him corpses, and he can feed him, let him

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:36.880
rape stuff, and you can slice people with a blade.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.240
Sometimes I think we take our Pyramid Head love a little bit too far on this program.

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.720
I don't know if it's just me.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.160
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.000
Loki, go ahead and start us off tonight.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.320
My final thought is, there's going to be more announcements coming out.

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.560
Not everything gets announced at E3.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:01.120
God's sake, most people nowadays have their own gamer days and shit.

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.800
My final thought is, I twisted my ankle earlier, and it kind of hurts.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.800
Owie.

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:06.800
Ice it.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:07.800
I know I need to.

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:11.080
Dr. Sakura.

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:15.080
Reject false conventions.

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.600
On that note, we'll see you next time.

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.920
