{"text": " tonight July 22nd 2007 the next Final Fantasy use the Wii Fit board Microsoft faces another lawsuit over scratch discs and could World of Warcraft win South Park and welcome to another week of orange lounge radio we are that internet radio program dedicated to video games video gaming and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle that's a whole lot we've tried to fit a lot into this program but that's why we're always split up into two parts when you listen to us on our downloadable podcast or if you listen live on Sunday nights you get like three and a half hours of radio just us here my name is Rob Roberts you might know me as Sky out joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura Jamie Summers hi and how are you hi hi are you high on drugs I am but legal ones yeah their prescription we wouldn't endorse doing the other kind of drugs because that's bad okay not publicly yes all right also joining us say hello to tech master Loki low how are you doing okay fine had a good week yes sort of okay that's kind of cryptic and also joining us tonight he hasn't been here for a little while but he's joining us for tonight I know he's gonna be the whole show or what but say hello to me let off how are you I'm fine it's been a long time since we've had you on the show yeah like two weeks yeah so for those that have never heard well you you haven't like actually sat in on a full show in a long long oh yeah that's true and you're actually like really loud tonight I am that's kind of something I'm booming that's right he's miklotov uses a very quiet voice we have to like turn up the volume all the way yes um now for those that haven't heard the show before miklotov works for konami and does DDR stuff yes that's all we can really say but they're closing soon right yes so are you leaving or what's going on can you say I don't know I don't know if I can say or not so I'm gonna choose to not say anything all right all right I won't put you on the spot I know that your co-workers might listen I want you get busted I don't care if they listen all right well maybe thoughts here cuz he likes games he's not just here to dish on I'm actually here because I was up here for Harry Potter let's I suppose it's inevitable because somebody was noticing hi chat room by the way our chair was available to chat orange laundry calm lots of first-time listeners tonight I was noticing some folks saying it was our first time listening so hello to all of you first-time listeners in chat it's kind of a smaller audience in chat tonight though what I was thinking maybe part of that is that people are reading Harry Potter right now they are they should actually be done with it because it's been out for like two days so you finished an hour before I before I left the house oh my gosh so you finished the book about two hours ago so both of you finished the book yeah I finished about this afternoon sometime and I don't read the books I would have been been done last night but I had to play D&D I just wanted to get done with it because then I could go back on the internet and not get spoiled by things I know I hate all of you spoiler people yes and no spoilers in chat tonight don't even try to be funny it's not cool so please don't ruin the book for those haven't finished yet you know there's a lot to ruin I could kill I will Avada Kedavra your ass I went directly to the spoiler page as soon as I found it you know I don't know it's part of me I like to be spoiled and find out what's gonna happen I don't even really read the book so watch the movies I haven't seen the newest one in fact I didn't see the fourth one either but I like the first three movies they're cool the fifth movie sucks now Jamie did you actually go to the bookstore at midnight to buy the book no I was smart and went on Amazon oh so you had to deliver to your house yes I went to Barnes and Noble because I was also high on Vicodin I couldn't drive to the bookstore although Dan said that he went to Walmart and almost bought me one the Rob D says spoiler Jesus dies on page 681 oh you weren't looking for Bible spoilers get it I think I saw that I think I saw that same joke on dig this week failed I'm just kidding no but I went I went to Barnes and Noble at about 1030 on Friday and there were already a ton of people there because I wasn't there to buy Harry Potter smelly people there was the fattest Hermione I'd ever seen in my life was there actually so but I went bought the book for stardust because I got to see a sneak preview of that movie that's coming out a couple weeks stardust and I loved it it was like a video game I had Sky Pirates like Final Fantasy 12 it was awesome and like magic and Michelle Pfeiffer was which it was great so I I wanted to get the book that it was based on and they had it at Barnes and Noble but then like I had to like go through crowds and crowds of people it was crazy why did you go on Harry Potter night because I was there I went to two Barnes and Nobles for Harry Potter night we went to eat at dos coyotes was like right next door to Barnes and Noble so we just decided to go there I was like I want to get the stardust book right now I was there too waiting with my wife for the book and I was playing Final Fantasy well that makes you a nerd too I waited in the Harry Potter line last year and I already bought my British one online and I ended up the still wasn't as bad as the Dreamcast line in 99 the Dreamcast line I sat and read books I just walked into games or EB games when James came out so did I I just was like we did the midnight thing at a GameStop I don't think Wichita is big enough for that looking in chat room uninvited says we handed out cupcakes for our book release at Walmart and this old smelly lady came up and ate like 12 one per person unless you ordered 12 books or had a little sign or something but that just kind of reminded me of the time the we came out and we were handing out you know the soda and the doughnuts and smelly people it was some were smelly but not at the target we ended up staying it was they were all well well-bathed it's too cold to be smelly cuz when it's cold you can't really smell people as badly as when it's hot like anime conventions I think that fanboy funk is worse in the summer if you let it sit out for a little while all right boy funk does not take summer vacation all right let's let's talk about video games we're like more than five minutes in the show we haven't talked about video games just been that I said Final Fantasy video games are video games too but they're not good cuz why is why isn't there a good Harry Potter game cuz they're made by you haven't made me design one that's not mean that it's a bad it should be a bad game if it's made by you know it's the fact that they take franchises and and don't care about them they're just like oh give me money on them yeah here was now here was the nerdiest thing ever though we were at claim jumper last night or whatever and we were going around the table going like what what house would you be in if you were in Harry Potter probably in sparkly poo there is no sparkly poo you have to read the fanfiction whatever anyway so we thought why isn't Harry Potter like an MMO why isn't there an MMO set in the Harry Potter universe millions of people would play it if they could be you could have like actual like Quidditch and doing quests in the Harry Potter universe why isn't there actually a game on ps2 is fun to exactly whatever it was I don't think the universe would be that big I mean it'd be Hogwarts and well I guess you could you could have a bunch of other school there are other schools so well now there's not gonna be any more books why not have you know why not have an MMO in the Harry Potter universe hmm who says it's not coming I mean look at Lord of the Rings online I did the quiz that was on the Warner Brothers site and I got Slytherin I didn't think I did the quiz I got Ravenclaw I was like what the fuck's a Ravenclaw even smarter because they're also sneaky all right let's get to actual like video game chat I will start with how was your gaming week dark soccer how is your games what games I've been high on Vicodin all week so I haven't played anything not even pinball I did well no I played World Cup soccer see there's something but I am Ally so I can't really do much gaming all right well that's all right Loki how was your gaming week I played paper Mario on the virtual console not exactly like super paper Mario a little bit disappointing but I don't know it's tolerable for right now I guess I think if I played that right after I played Super Mario RPG I would have been greatly disappointed then I played Final Fantasy I'm actually most the way through the game now what else did I do gaming related I fully disassembled a PSP and put it back together again because I was thinking I let me put this way I have charge cables for my PSP but they're at work and I want to play Final Fantasy my battery was low so I was going to make my own charge cable but then I couldn't find this my car adapter cable that was going to hack apart for the second half of it so I was like well I could just solder some stuff on to the USB port on to the PSP and just solder that to the power port and then it should be able to charge via USB so I took that all apart and got fascinated with that I'm like crap this is not going to go back together again is it so I put it back together and I think it's working now except for some reason though when I put the USB charge cable I bought today on it it wasn't lighting up so I don't know if that's just the battery that's in there that's so dead they won't charge with that or what but hopefully it works otherwise that's my you know parts PSP anyway so I gotta sell it so I can get a new one then other than that I tried playing oh I played Super Rub-a-dub on ps3 crap is that one of those new downloadable games the one with the Ducks or whatever yes it's the one the Ducks it's actually a game rap yeah it's it's stupid what do you do in the game you tilt using the six axis because that's almost every single game that's downloadable on the PSP right now or ps3 you tilt the six axis to make the Ducks go around you collect ducks and get to the drain it is crap is so fucking hard to control it's not fun luckily I didn't download the full game I download the demo so no money lost is it the Ducks from the old first PlayStation demo they had from every single demo that they've done so far ducks have been all of them she's running gag and now it's a game no the game still running gag it's crap that's what it is gk 128 in our chat room agrees with you super rub-a-dub for the lose he also gk 128 says the controlling super rub-a-dub is so bad it doesn't even follow your movements right it doesn't and it's just way too sensitive so no thanks I ended up selling a lot or I sold back Motorstorm today you know now I'm just stuck with resistance which is you know great game but I just you know my PlayStation 3 right now is being treated like my PSP except my PSP has more gaming going along with it because I don't buy games anymore for it if only they had that for the oh I thought I'm thinking about modding my weight that might be something that's coming on mod chips I can play some import games at times all right me go Todd you want to share with us your gaming week if anything I've still been trying to think if I played anything this week besides Wow and I don't think I did so I played Wow what happened in Wow well it made me sad because I decided to level up my tailoring and there's this one piece of cloth I can only make every three days in 22 hours so I'm waiting for that time limit to be up I'm just being disgruntled the whole time while I wait and that's it all right aren't you exciting I am what's up it's something in the air and not a lot of game playing this week well I do that at work so I guess that's true I could see that I got a game what'd you get I got Marvel to moon Alliance for Xbox 360 but I didn't get the gold one cuz Dan was being a cheap but and he said that I could just download Hawkeye cuz it's really a character I care about okay so instead downloading the uber thing that had everybody you can just get the one character you want yeah I haven't played it yet also play Call of Duty 3 multiplayer for a little bit and there's one cool kill they had we were playing on eater dam and I was driving the Jeep across it and about to jump the little gap in the middle and then someone shot me in the head luckily for me I fell out of the Jeep of course I was dead but my Jeep went forward and went over the jump and ran them over so it was a double kill is hilarious and then of course grant up that advice series stories still playing that's still yelling at everybody nerd my gaming week I tried some of the new downloads that are available on Xbox live marketplace like Bomberman live but I only really played the demo for Bomberman about download full game so I don't really want to give a full review but it definitely already right off the bat was way better than act zero that's for sure even just the demo the free demo is better than the $60 act zero so I was pleased with that it's like 20 bucks now still $20 too much that's still $20 too much for that game but it's cool you know it's it's it's classic Bomberman so if you remember Bomberman from Super Nintendo days I did notice though that when you do buy the regular version of it you're gonna be able to customize the game to hell like you know you just customize like any type of environment you want to play in and different types of power-ups that are available and all that it's highly customizable so definitely a great tournament game I'm also played the ER kung-fu although I didn't buy the full version because I can play the full version on my computer because I have it through you know game to happen what have you I just checked out I did like I thought the new graphics are pretty cool but otherwise it's not really a game I'm very fond of from back in the day I mean like snow those ones that's like stood up against the test of time yeah you know I've I've I've I've defended time pilot and even Russian attack to an extent on this show but I just can't find my love for ER kung-fu not when there's other fighting games you know like Street Fighter 2 that are better and especially this HD remix on the way and so that I'm sure gonna be pretty awesome they need to put the grid on Xbox live pretty rad and the Rob Dean chat says a ER kung-fu is awful JV Mon says it sucks ass back in the day back in the day I preferred it to kung-fu master yeah I way perverted to kung-fu master but just now I just I can't you know like sometimes I try to I find my retro game love for the simple games but like ER kung-fu is not one of those games I can just find my love for again because I guess I never really have there's some of these games on live that they seem to forget about like you know oh yeah there's downloadable content coming later and it never does like boom boom rocket I thought there's more songs it's funny you should mention that because that's another game I got really into this week randomly like I haven't played boom boom rocket in months and then this week I was looking at my the high scores and I noticed that I'd fallen not just to second place within my own friends list but third place though my own friends list I'm like at one point I had a score in the top 100 okay so I was like alright I got to play this some more and try to improve my score so I did and I'm back up to second place now within my friends and now I gotta try and get back up to first place so I'm working on it playing some more songs but yeah there's no downloadable stuff for boom and rocket at all it's kind of sad because I'm not a big fan of the tracks that come with the game I even went to GameStop today I was like I got to get me in another game because I had I had like Forza 2, Shadowrun and like Tenchu Z and Monster Madness Bell for suburbia all brand new copies that I got from work but it's like I don't want to play any of this even Forza 2 I was like well I could maybe design some cars or something like no that's no I'm not gonna get suckered into playing this just like I did Project Gotham Racing 3 although Project Gotham Racing 4 that looks pretty good too but I'm gonna get suckered in buying that and hate it and then return it back either way to get one of those game rental accounts doesn't matter I'm gonna get it probably you know Microsoft games they usually get for free all right JV Mon and Chad agrees with me by the way that the tracks that come with the game are pretty boring so you go that one I like is really good I don't know smooth operetta yes smooth operetta yeah that's a great surprise Konami hasn't done like well I guess they wouldn't want to do that because of what a downloadable DDR something yeah because they would compete with their own game so why can't they do a downloadable beat mania or something even though you know I know there's a special controller comes with it and all but you know why not do like a button friendly version I don't know I guess I'm being stupid the other game I got really into randomly this week was Carcassonne I finally went back and played the demo more fully for that and I downloaded I ended up spending the cash to get the full game of Carcassonne because I got more into it into it than I did Settlers of Catan but I'll tell you this I suck at Carcassonne I am so horrible at that game like it took me forever to get the strategy down to that game I finally beat the computer in a match but I'm like in last place I've gone from boom boom rocket a game where I'm second place amongst all my friends to Carcassonne where I'm in last place amongst all my friends because I'm just not that good at it I'm still trying to figure out the strategy to it but I'm having fun like I like the fact that it's like a board game but it kind of has its own like you know the you basically the way Carcassonne is is that you're building a puzzle every time and that puzzle involves cities and roads and monasteries and all this stuff and you draw out these cards in a random order and play them down and so you know roads have to connect to other roads cities have to connect to other cities and when you claim roads or claim cities and finish them you get a lot of points for them so it's kind of cool like I've got to play it on Xbox Live and I'm afraid to cuz I know I'll get my ass handed to me but I guess that's the only way you're gonna get better at a game like that so but I've been having fun playing it so yay Carcassonne that's it for my gaming week so we will move from our gaming weeks to some housekeeping first off we want to thank or congratulate I should say one of our longtime listeners DDR angel I don't know if you remember DDR angel I should hope not at all I should hope so she was here for the longest time she got married today so I'm gonna say congratulations congratulations miss DDR angel and her husband who by the way goes online I believe by big red pimp now she's DDR pimp lady yes now she's DDR pimp so congratulations to DDR miss DDR pimp also no show next week we're not gonna be doing any show next week there may be a best-ever something that shows up on the archives that there's time but unfortunately just due to other obligations there will be no show on July 29th so we're very sorry about that dark soccer is going to Disneyland again but I am and I'm gonna be high as a kite there too and usually we would just go ahead and do a show if one of us is gone but also we're moving this is the very last show you're gonna hear from studio number three which we've had you know a good couple of years here we've been here for about two years in this tiny little room but the show basically if you haven't caught on takes place in my spare bedroom and my apartment and in a couple weeks it will take place in the spare bedroom or maybe garage haven't figured it out yet at my new house so I'm very excited about that kind of moving on up so we will be in the new studio soon that'll be studio number four so yes the show has been a lot of places over the past five years so we're excited about that so kind of like a whore what do you mean a little bit well to use it to use a friend of mine's analogy we're like the house broom everyone's had a ride I get it all right well here's the thing also we're looking to kind of relaunch of sorts in a couple weeks like not like we're gonna totally redo the show but maybe try some new things like some new album art some new openings some new incidental sounds and stuff that play throughout the show so if you are a artistic or audio editing type please shoot us an email because we'd be interested in what you can do for us in regards to it new intros and new artwork and all that good stuff so more to come in two weeks when we return with more orange lounge radio for now though let's get to the gaming news for this week and I believe Loki's gonna start us off tonight yes so this week there is a bunch of news coming out of Japan during their PlayStation premiere event in Tokyo and some interesting things coming out mostly stuff that we're not going to see over here one of which is a TV tuner for the PSP it's actually a one seg tuner device and kind of attaches to the top of via the USB port much like the GPS receiver and camera and apparently you can tune into different TV stations and one that's supposed to be coming out in September and that's kind of cool wish it we'd get something like that over here me something third-party I know why is it that we're not getting any stuff over here yes never came out over here either and I don't think the camera did either so maybe we're just not into all those things over here we I know we care about high-tech gadgets over here but not like Japan does that's why we get two colors of things sometimes three Japan gets a hundred and fifty eight versions a week but TVs are kind of cool I don't know I might make the PSP a little more lucrative it depends how much it costs how much does it cost in Japan I was 6,900 yen that's about what $69 right I'm not mistaken yeah all right oh by the way it's only compatible with the new PSP not the old one not that it really matters because in September it's gonna be replacing all the old ones anyways gee Sony likes to do that replace old stuff oh yeah like they're the only company out there that redesigns their systems Nintendo I'm looking at you all right but they make them better and in better colors speaking of better colors there are more PSP color variations coming out in Japan you know how we're getting what we're getting like three colors here two colors in a in the Star Wars okay well over there they're getting piano black ceramic white and ice silver but they're also getting the bloom series with rose pink lavender purple and Felicia blue I want that blue one so bad but this sounds like bubble bath salts colors it's so pretty this sounds like something a housewife would pour in her bathtub and say Calgon take me away PS Sony take me away have salt and bubbles because it would not make bubbles well whatever but still it sounds like baths I'm getting bath salts and bubble baths mixed up okay so that's six variants on the new PSP and they already had like at least four of the regular PSP and so I can't help but feel we're really getting shafted when Sony is doing better over here than they are in Japan well it is launching in Japan on September 29th 19,800 yen and any of those colors that you want there's also some new accessories coming out AV cable super video cable D cable component cable now that's pretty awesome there's a component cable coming out for the video out not just there is that's pretty rad they'll do 480p god now I want one just for the video out so I can play Silent Hill but not it was Silent Hill origins I can play the Akumajo Dracula compilation game that's coming out what what nothing whatever all that I can play all that crap on the TV I'm very excited playing that game for a long time already but it's sexy sexy remake but the original is better whatever it's pretty shush original has Maria's crappy singing in it well maybe one of her weapons is a song book and she kills things by going wow I think I almost died a little right that's exactly what her voice sounds like to you well anyway anyway um I'm sorry I'm all giggly today no um there is a little bit of good news for our friends in Europe the PSP will actually be out there it beginning of September and in Japan it will be there on September 20th so you guys get it first you can just go rub it in everybody's face so Europe actually gets something first for once they got stuff first before remember a few games well nami loves Europe for some reason they get a lot of the cool stuff this has nothing to do with konami no but it's Europe does get stuff first sometimes what's that wow but the the price is gonna be the same as the current ones it's a 129.99 what colors are they getting it does not say oh also and not much of a surprise since we're getting the stupid Star Wars PSP over here that Japan would get something a little bit cooler in the special Final Fantasy 7 system set which will be coming out bundled with crisis core and has some fancy Final Fantasy 7 crisis core artwork on it also it's gonna be a limited production there are only making 77,777 units you know why that is right because it's Final Fantasy 7 and it's not because 7 is the most powerful magic number is beside that actually there was in Final Fantasy 7 if you got I've only heard of this happening if you got your hit points all to seven then you did some special attack for in the game the special attack was called go outside and buy more sequels of this game when it comes out I'm gonna find it so I'm looking I'm just looking at chat room now and going back to some old comments here the Rob D says I want to see Maria and Kirby in a sing-off and the dark no cuz no dark Tatsuya wants to add jigglypuff to that no Maria sings worse than all of them let's see and chainsaw juggling said I did that once it was awesome in reference to the lucky sevens there see I knew it was in there drunami says seven seven seven HP send your character into a constant attack mode yeah it's awesome all right well even though they are getting that super cool Final Fantasy 7 slim thing PSP in Japan everybody is hopefully getting this it's an expansion to Metal Gear Solid portable ops course a lot of folks are big fans of this game on the PSP because it wasn't Metal Gear acid and it was actually more like the other Metal Gear games a lot of folks are really into this your acid though had the cool 3d thing I cool is relative and that cooler headache inducing I know if I wear that thing too long I would definitely have to take some Vicodin for the headaches I'm gonna be getting after using that too much so there you go now IGN is actually reporting from the PlayStation premiere event in Tokyo that this new portable ops game is going to have some online play and that's going to be kind of its focus there's going to be some new characters possibly an older version of snake and there's only going to be a little bit more as far as the single-player mode goes the infinity mission otherwise it's the good old-fashioned Metal Gear Solid portable ops that you're used to they do have old snake from Metal Gear Solid 4 in there he's in the trailer awesome September 20th is the day that comes out hmm I seem to remember something else is coming out that day in Japan as well there it is probably take a little bit longer for it to come out here though because you know Konami hates you and they did some little thing in the yes and they did something in the video where it's like Power Rangers for the trailer that makes me want to play it now dang it well other stuff for anyone who cares is that there is actually going to be a Metal Gear Solid online for ps3 they had a little demo of it out when they did the Metal Gear Solid 4 thing so if anybody cares there you go you can all wander around with boxes over your heads I get you know and your truck can start to move could Metal Gear Solid ever be like a first-person shooter someday it was when do you remember the VR missions they came out with a first-person version of metal in Japan it did came out with the first person version of Metal Gear Solid it just kind of makes me think like with all this like online and all that stuff could this be like a new halo I don't know for a certain audience I don't know it's a little silly I would say it's more like Splinter Cell or you know recon some but I don't know I think I'd play it a lot if it was I know Metal Gear Solid is one of those series but I don't get into the Tom Clancy games as much I don't get into them I don't get into that stuff either like the old-ass Metal Gear I used to love house does I don't I don't get into those games as much although the solid I it would be kind of cool to implement that into our website the what the solid I for the you know Melger acid to that that freaking headache inducing thing the thing though but it makes it 3d so I'd be kinda neat a little silly it would be jvmon says first-person shooters suck though that's an opinion that's an opinion some of them are fun some of them do suck but some are fun I love hexen I love like quake 3 that game was badass and Duke Nukem 3d hello why do you think so many people are crazy about doing them forever blaze says correction halo sucks Gears of War is amazing see I don't know I think I could not get into Gears of War at all so I could not get into it I try crazy fun I tried so hard anyways so of course last week you know there's a whole debacle about you know the 68 system being phased out in the 88 system coming into place well there's some interesting commentary about the whole thing coming from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's president David Reeves in fact he's actually been on record saying you know the difference between 60 and 80 gigabytes is very small we're just we just feel like going up 20 gigabytes is not worth it you're gonna double it then it's worth it so basically you know obviously he's commenting on the fact that I don't think the 80 system is coming to Europe I think they're going to be doing something a little bit larger but at the same time you see oh by the way yeah you probably don't need to buy it for another extra 20 why doesn't he just admit we don't have 20 gigs worth of shit for you to put on here there really is not that much stuff to download that's what I don't get I you know if I would think it now I don't know I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner and I haven't been reading up very well but does the PlayStation 3 allow you to play movies like from your computer yeah it does anything like any type of movie it's limited but you can play stuff from your computer you copy them to the PlayStation 3 drive or anything you can't download them from your networking copy him but you can download some on there like I have a rip copy of kung pao on my hard drive that can play off there but nothing officially endorsed by Sony I don't think there's any movies that you can download from Sony like let's say on my xbox 360 I can watch wmv files of a certain type over the network and watch them on my TV right yeah but on the Sony I can do that with certain other types of movies yeah why doesn't Sony just blow the door wide open on that and just leave it unlimited to what you get like put all the different codex in there to what you can watch and people would like love that and they could copy movies to their drive and everything I don't know my guy absurd I never understood why they bumped it up from 60 80 anyways because I guess unless you know a lot of games really install themselves onto the drive like I remember Ridge Racer did that and the oblivion I know does that but I haven't really I don't have that many PlayStation 3 games so I can't say if they all do that but if they did all do that then yeah that would fill up pretty quick but at the same time as far as downloadable content that's available on their PlayStation Store there's hardly anything on there I mean I check maybe once every few months and there may be one or two things more on there they're actually worth downloading Ravens Dolphin says what Sony is telling the truth for once and the Rob D says MPAA sky but the MPAA you know what they can't control what if I have a video I shoot on my digital camera that I want to watch over on the TV you know they can't control that F the MPAA you know those comments coming from our chat room chat dot orange lounge radio.com something else maybe that could be a downloadable title I don't know the early screenshots I'm seeing that this game look very simplistic it's from the creator of Katamari Dimashii Kata Takahashi you might remember he said he was taking a break to work on playgrounds remember that like he was supposedly ended konmari Dimashii to go make playgrounds well I don't know if he finished or what's going on but he is released information about a new game for the PlayStation 3 no B no B boy now no B means stretch in Japanese so in the early screenshots definitely look like this big stretching I don't know turdie caterpillar thing stretching around so there's very little information on this is right now but we do know that the creator of Katamari Dimashii is making a new game for the PlayStation 3 that's about it so that's kind of interesting because you know a lot of folks on PlayStation 3 were really sad because there has been no news about beautiful Katamari coming out to their system in fact now it looks like that whole project may have been scrapped so maybe they'll get this new project instead which could be somewhat redemption for them I don't know kind of interesting I think they're beyond redemption they deserve to burn no thinking speaking of things that deserve to burn is a Gran Turismo prologue is going to be available for Japanese PlayStation Network in October we don't get it yet it will have online multiplayer and has an undetermined price it is not free great you get to pay for a demo that's awesome I just say it's more freaking cars so whatever project Gotham is more fun why don't you release an actual game instead of all these demos that's what I think another game that's coming out to PlayStation 3 at least was announced a Disgaea 3 looks very similar to all the other Disgaea games and sadly enough the graphics also look similar to the other Disgaea games meaning that they're not that great but hey it's Disgaea it's another game hurrah yeah Disgaea was never really about the graphics though it was a hilarious voice acting in the stories and you know the game itself it was pretty awesome strategy it looks okay I mean I don't know I would think though that if they're gonna step up to PlayStation 3 they're gonna do something with the graphics make them uber sharp or you know it does look a little sharper but then again the screenshots so small I don't really know well there you go also coming for the PlayStation 3 at some point someday Tekken 6 Tekken 6 is going to be coming up I'm sorry oh Tekken 6 is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and of course you know Virtua Fighter is going to have online on the Xbox 360 so it just makes sense that Virtua Fighter sucks PlayStation should have something going for it and that's going to be Tekken 6 Namco Bandai answered at PlayStation Premiere in Tokyo that they will have the online capability you know I don't think that these should really be announcements anymore I think it should always be an online game I mean this is what we Microsoft doesn't go out there and out hey this game is gonna be online most of the games are online it's not something that you really need to announce just get with it Sony or hell get with it Namco I mean you should yeah because when everything online it's not Sony's fault there was this big to-do about Soul Calibur finally going online too and everybody's just kind of like yeah the last one really should have been online right so I don't know that's like saying you know you know Tekken 6 is gonna be in high definition okay great I thought it was supposed to be since it's on you know the PlayStation 3 all right well whatever whatever it is you're into we know that Dark Sakura is into this it's her website of the week and every week Dark Sakura surfs the internet up and down and back and forth and finds a website suitable of sharing with all of you it's called Dark Sakura's website of the week and here it is my website of the week because I couldn't concentrate long enough to actually pick a real site so I picked a version of the site I picked before and it's ROFL cats calm it's more lol cats so there you go more Caturday first to spread the badly grammar spelling cat captioning fun because we've really not had any of that on this show ever not a long time this is pretty funny stuff because it has like a couple my favorites on there like like what show me one show me a funny one I'll be the judge at this site the judge jury and executioner she's looking folks the justice system or fucking screwed super cat I don't know I don't know I like going to kitten or dot-com or whatever it's called that gets me through the day sometimes what kitten war yeah cuz they put two it's like a like a rate your cat site and they put two pictures of cats of you say which one's cuter it's adorable okay one more oh now that's funny that's why I see it's a picture of Winnie the Pooh and you're saying take up please yeah that's funny all right your psych is that acceptable I will allow this site is Rob pleased with my offering I have it ceiling cat is very pleased with your offering next story please I don't get that crap anyways it's not surprising we talked a little bit about this last week there was a survey that went out to all the attendees of e3 this year kind of asking them their opinions on certain things that they're possibly going to change for next year of the following they were offering new locations including Santa Monica San Diego Laguna Beach San Francisco or LA also they were prefer our question was do you prefer to see the summit held in multiple hotel settings like it was this year or a convention center type larger facility setting I know I'll probably speak for Bobby insane larger facility convention center type setting instead of having to drive between hotels and says also they're talking about what month you like you know options included May through August and then of course if you didn't visit Barker hangar or the Fairmount Hotel why not I hope it comes to because I was stuck in traffic I wasn't invited he'll get a link to the survey so we can fill out I wasn't invited I didn't visit it because it's eight hours away too far although I did not find it interesting that you one of the choices was San Francisco and you've been begging and pleading for it to come to San Francisco's that way cuz you're lazy and you don't have to you know flyer anything you could just drive driver to LA for a convention I will I swear I'll only fly to LA ever again because I hate that drive so horrible I drive great on that drive is the most boring drive is pretty boring you probably take the five yeah five is pretty boring but 99 is not much better 99 has great truck stops on the way and you meet all kinds of colorful people it's like five is like field field field field mountain field field field smell and cow like by what was it that Marissa called it a cow shwits cow shwits the town of Kohling a beautiful stuff anyway the Rob D is saying they've never driven in Illinois have they hostile on her miss here the people in Illinois don't know how to drive at all son of dad says e-308 in Vegas for the win I would not mind e-308 in Vegas I don't think Vegas would work oh why not but it's Vegas well they just did was it the ESA thing there or EMA camera what is the video kind of their big convention in Vegas and it sucks in Vegas everything's way expensive and act deaf says e3 in Mexicali Mexico hell yeah e3 in Mexico let's have it in Tijuana that would rock I'm gonna go to Mexico this year for what world pump finals they moved it out of Korea this year and they're putting it in Mexico so I'm gonna have to you know bring soap and something to keep the dirtiness away and a water filter horrible and a water you guys are horrible I'm sure those stereotypes are not true it's always gamer day at Easter Island it's so fitting mmm blaze says e3 in Canada so Rob can get more maple cookies I like that idea e3 in Canada requires leaving nothing against Canada but they're not gonna have anything up there ever they have red PlayStations I live Canada I wouldn't to Brad I will take California drivers over Alabama drivers any day all right Florida drivers may I move on may I do a new story no no one thing you might remember we were all giddy about on this program about a year ago was the Silent Hill movie remember Silent Hill came out we were all excited because his pyramid had like right there it's not four times you know he cut the shit out of people and rip that lady's skin off it was awesome and so of course we were excited about a Silent Hill 2 coming out but now I don't know how excited this is gonna make people about Silent Hill 2 because Christoph Ganz has said I'm sorry I don't have the time to do Silent Hill 2 so he's not gonna be doing this is good news to you yes why cuz I didn't think he did a great job with the first one that's all right you know what you know who's wrapping up filming on Far Cry ooh a bowl yeah god I hope he's available somebody just needs to shoot that man in the head yeah careful what you have to understand in Silent Hill now will be setting will be setting the jungle on an island so be a rave there someone needs to strap that man down and lobotomize the section of his brain that controls writing movies oh wait they already did that explains his last few movies well anyway since Christoph Ganz is not on the next film Roger Avery took a hike as well now see what's going on is that Ganz has said to a French magazine DVD Rama that the sequel was ordered by Sony but he's kind of too busy with other movies like Onimusha which he's adapting that game as well obviously um so he can't do it he said this quote if I cannot take on Silent Hill 2 myself the director who does would need to continue in the same style as the first film and then make you excited Jane one does not want that crappy did get the style right one does not want to make a Hollywood style movie and I think that it makes sense if the director of the sequel is European in the best case scenario French so there it is and Roger Avery said if I'm not gonna do Silent Hill 2 if Christoph's not gonna do it that's fine we don't need them they just go the way of the Resident Evil movies I know Resident Evil is bad because they don't really follow well anything it's kind of gone on its own tangent but it'd be cool like if Silent Hill kind of took over the world and then you have people trying to survive all these mutated evil things not everybody enjoyed the Silent Hill movie though I know a lot of people did and I liked it those well then they can just make a sequel from me exactly they should have me write it it's just it just stars pyramid head seriously they should have me where I will write it's pyramid head gone wild honestly they just need to look at the second game and then take the dialogue and then add some scenes where the action takes place and there you got you got your second movie but what I don't want it to turn into is I don't want Silent Hill Silent Hill series to turn into like the Halloween series where it's just like pyramid head kills everything you know a pyramid head at summer camp killing lovely young ladies now if they wanted to spin off series I'm all fine with that Freddy versus Jason versus pyramid head oh you know they both die cuz pyramid heads awesome I'll be awesome because nobody can kill a pyramid head he has to end up offing himself son of dad says a Luca Besson Silent Hill would own wasn't he the guy that did the fifth element I'd be pretty hot that would be hot hmm maybe maybe we shall see Bruce Willis as pyramid head no Bruce Willis versus pyramid head that would be fun cuz then no John McLean versus pyramid head cuz nobody would die hard fun they just take out the whole fucking world between them okay so so I guess what else keep speaking of you know weird bizarreness that episode is South Park where they did the World of Warcraft thing which I finally saw two days ago is up for an Emmy glad she's on top of it I don't watch TV I have to either be really bored or high on Vicodin to watch TV and I was high as a kite on okay for to explain to people who are listening I broke two ribs so I'm currently medicated so that's why I sound like a goofball tonight and I was bored enough tonight hey shut up and I was I was so bored that I decided to watch the South Park episode of World of Warcraft what the other way around you know what I mean did live up to your expectations it was kind of funny but there was stuff that was wrong but I did think it was your son's character is going to die I was like oh shit bathroom bathroom I know people who get like that is so stupid so I thought it was funny but so does it deserve an Emmy no what's the Emmy for I don't know this is nominated for one it's just got nominated for one who cares the poop award for animated defecation awesome well there's gonna be some good stuff coming out this week not a whole lot but some pretty good stuff in the u.s. if you're a fan of the NASCAR series you'll be happy to know there's a new game coming out from EA NASCAR 08 on a PlayStation 2 360 and the PlayStation 3 also on PlayStation 2 this week shimagane tensei persona 3 which I meant to play this week but never got around to it that is also coming out and then a small little game called guitar hero encore rocks the 80s that's gonna be making its way out on PlayStation 2 and then let's see here on the PSP we have Final Fantasy 2 which I'm trying to finish Final Fantasy 1 so I can play this alien certain syndromes gonna be coming out on the Wii and PSP also a weird game from Eidos called escape from bug Island which you may know as a necron Asia wasn't very good in Japan so now it's mediocre over here and I'm not really surprised of this but yet another tycoon games coming out on PC ride carnival tycoon and yeah let's ride friends forever yet another horse riding game yay horse riding games and dynasty warriors DS on the DS I totally misheard that title by the way would you hear it as miss let's what ride friends and I don't know let's ride friends let's ride friends forever let horses ride friends that's that's wrong no where is your where is your mind what are you sure you're only on by get in I'm sure and a sieve and civilization for expansion pack will also be coming out this week as well sieve for beyond the sword all right well coming out over in Japan are some games this week on July 26th for the Xbox 360 Major League Baseball 2k7 and finally you asked for it the Elder Scrolls for oblivion is coming out in Japan localized for Japan so you guys finally get that I know you're excited about that July 26th on the Xbox 360 also coming out on some of the other systems on the Wii Dewey's adventure makes its debut over in Japan which is not a good game it's no really I don't like it one bit why don't you like it I just don't like the controls at all I think it's a cute game and it's definitely Ella bits ish but it's it's not fun to set the Wii's problem or is that the game's problem because I noticed a lot of it's not the Wii's problem I mean this could have been done with a 6-axis too I just don't think the last time I played it the controls were tight enough also coming out in Japan Mario Party 8 guilty gear double X accent core and some jigsaw puzzle games coming out from Hudson Entertainment mobile suit Gundam and just for you Jamie Puyo Puyo 15th anniversary I love on the Nintendo Wii yeah but seriously I mean seriously how many of those Puyo Puyo games I have a bunch of Puyo Puyo games I even have the PC Engine one coming out on the PlayStation 3 Major League Baseball 2k7 Mina no golf 5 and one gun midnight is coming out on the PlayStation 3 shit I want to practically import that game I was awesome I love the arcade series screenshots for that and I thought that was kind of interesting it looks like it's the first game though I don't know how would you practically import it like just get the instruction book well cuz PlayStation 3 is free order with all sorts of practicality like if I'm gonna rationalize getting a PlayStation 3 that's one of the games that would actually make me want to do it because I love that I don't know if it's region free for the games though that's the only thing god damn it I'm not sure well hold well this I thought it was region free for games not from the site says no region protection well then awesome I'm gonna have to import that fuck yeah oh yeah well me too well fuck yeah twice uh-huh anyway I don't want to fuck yeah twice PlayStation 2 is getting a lot of stuff going into best hits but they're getting some new games as well I believe this is new ikki tosen shining dragon is coming out and then also the metal gear 20th anniversary collection metal gear solid 2 Metal Gear Solid 3 and another your solid collection is all coming out PlayStation our Phantasy Star Universe takes a price cut as it moves into the best series and sanyo pachinko paradise 14 oh also another another game goes into Sega ages this would be volume 30 galaxy force 2 in Japan you big fan of galaxy force no I don't know Nintendo DS is getting a lot of games as well this is a big release week for games over there a Taiko no Tatujin on the DS is coming out over there and also this is great another Hello Kitty game this one is called Hello Kitty no I shot a party Sanrio characters Zuka and DS isn't that a mouthful it's an action game but it has all your favorite Hello Kitty characters I see twin star I see kiropi but I don't see bats Maru so this game fails let's see if there's anything on the PSP real quick alexa silvara and the charm says Wangen midnight equals maximum tune to now not necessarily the box art doesn't say its maximum tune to it just calls it when again mid get midnight it's all-encompassing I don't know if it's all-encompassing or what it is I would be the ideal I would think on the PlayStation 3 also look at more information on this game with that up during the oh you looking that up right now well I was looking at it is region free so it's not that expensive either which is good I'm just like I don't know if it's all in Japanese or something because some of those games can actually be in English as well I just I don't have any careful well on the Sony PSP you finally get Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories in Japan Capcom is bringing that to you I always think that's interesting how that works intercontinental there how different companies can bring the games see because the other game that I would like to get also maybe would be folks all you know like folklore that's gonna be coming over here well that's all I got for Japanese releases maybe I can get well I have some European releases but only a few we have guilty your dust strikers on DS guilty your judgment on PSP and they're finally getting the pokey man's diamond and pearl which was also a print album I'm done wow I was quick there's other games listed with with uh to be announced titles but you know there's nothing really specific which I would assume that some of these would already be out I would hope like Saints Row is listed for ps3 okay here's the deal with Wangan midnight and all that is that I'm looking at Wikipedia and apparently this is actually the third game in the series so this would be like Wangan midnight maximum tune 3 it's going to be a simultaneous release in the arcade PlayStation 3 and PSP hell yeah there it is that's pretty rad sign me up that might be I might try that wouldn't it be amazing if they did that for like a good series you don't like that game I don't care about I never played it you've never played it then how can you knock it because the track is amazing that's there I can knock it for that it's got a poetry song on it why don't you know it's usual Shiro is she like getting one of the throat in it maybe I doubt it it sounds like that in every song she sings I know but I doubt it see drunami sets miklotov on fire in shed SSG 100 says lol Shane's being a dick tonight tonight that's like I'm being a jerk again it never stops and I know gosh I always have something negative to say I wondered why we hadn't had you on this show in a long time and then I remembered why because I hate things and stuff you hate things and stuff and stuff definitely and stuff and stuff damn those things and stuff all right anyways move on to more news please I want to end this segment so other things to hate x07s gone so where are we gonna get some more news from Microsoft well yeah it's rumors around the internet because they're always true exact eight and same goes with Sony we'll get into that a little bit later but anyways um yeah there's no real x07 this year according to Microsoft exec Erin Greenberg instead they are going to be trying to do some sort of other event that will be taking place in the UK so yeah other event no already at Chuck E Cheese have Chuck E Cheese over there I'm gonna Chuck E Cheese what are they I have Chuck E Cheese is nasty pizza though but they do have this Mike's incredible or John's incredible pizza or whatever it is yeah that new one here yeah we should go they don't have that in the UK either do they have like Chuck E Cheese type places in the UK what do they call you happy it's a time theater please please email me right now I'm gonna go Chuck E Cheese to go play pump it up you know I was she would know Jamie cuz you're like up on your British call but I don't care about Chuck E Cheese all right I haven't cared about Chuck E Cheese since it was show biz maybe somebody will email us and tell us let me know if you have pizza time theater please all right in fact we give emails we're gonna get to the mail bag very shortly here and I read the avalanche of emails that came into our mailbox this week at mail bag at orange everybody but first this was a big story here Peter Moore has left Microsoft that's right Peter Moore has been become very well known lately it's kind of like the face of Microsoft and a lot of these events and of course Peter Moore came to Microsoft from Sega which drew all these comparisons about the Xbox 360 launch versus the Dreamcast launch and so on well Peter Moore is actually left to move back to the Bay Area so welcome back Peter Moore even though we're not technically in the Bay Area we're close enough Peter Moore has come back to the Bay Area to be with his family so what he's gonna do now he's going to head up EA Sports is what his new role is going to be so even though he's gone from working for a giant you know console maker to a publisher that's still nothing to blink at that's still a very important role EA makes crap loads of money and if you're wondering who is going to replace Peter Moore well it's going to be Don Matrick who comes from EA he's coming from EA there you go and will be interesting to see if this has any type of changes on Microsoft's PR but probably not probably not really gonna be the same old stuff see a son of dad says Peter Moore quit to go work at showbiz you know it's funny you know where Reggie Fils-Aime came from you know one of the places he worked before he was at Nintendo Pizza Time Theatre no Panda Express really yeah but I mean look at you know Panda Express is nasty but it's everywhere now it's insanely popular so I don't know if that was his doing or what but there you go no it was the doing it was people addicted to MSG maybe all right anyhow I'll see we mentioned the mailbags coming up so let's get into the mailbag dark soccer likes to read your emails that you send this every week well dark soccer is forced at gunpoint to read your emails that you send to us twice a week at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com so let's get out the old gun and I'll just shine up the gun and point it to Jamie's head all right let's read some emails or I'm gonna pull the trigger hey Rob what STFU MF I'll shoot the kiddies I will shoot the Caturday oh no okay we got two whole emails thank you people because I can't really read very well right now I am heading to Anaheim California from August 37 for Blizzcon okay everybody look for this guy are you guys going and if you are want to grab some food and a restaurant I want to grab a restaurant too and most likely other people from World of Warcraft radio I guess I hope you guys don't think okay never mind this guy's just inviting us to lunch who's that from speedy f40 speedy yeah I know he's plugged the Wow radio thing before you know I'm not gonna if you weren't there um the last weekend of this month then you can go to Disneyland with me if you pay how does that work I am NOT going to Blizzcon none of us are going to Blizzcon but you know what you know who is going to Blizzcon blizzard yes blizzard is going to Blizzcon so say hi to them no so actually olr will have some representation at Blizzcon you're gonna love this this is hilarious extra fur is going to Blizzcon he got he got a ticket to Blizzcon for his birthday from his sister and her fiance who both also play Wow in our guild so look for extra fur I actually want to send him with the tape recorder a microphone to do some interviews at Blizzcon because I think it would be hilarious sure so that's gonna be your olr representation at Blizzcon right there but unfortunately because of the move and everything it's it's too close to the finances for me probably doesn't help also that all the tickets sold out within like a few hours that didn't help either and I was out of town when they went on sale otherwise I might have bought one oh well so they had interesting to see me go to Blizzcon because I have no interest in World of Warcraft drunami says if we hang out with Wow radio we should say hi to total biscuit I don't know who that is but I'm sure somebody listening does so there total biscuit can I read the next you may okay hey olr crew it's me necky sorry I haven't emailed in a while but I've been really busy been loving the show recently by the way warning this might be really long no I've got longer sorry you don't quite meet the the longest email category I've seen longer I've seen plenty longer I've seen thicker can I read please yes you perverted people what I was talking about emails shut up boo-hoo my 360 died earlier this week and although it's a pain in the ass Microsoft is very good at cleaning this up I had to I had to phone twice second because I forgot my original mobile no but I was only on hold for a best ten minutes each call so things should go to Microsoft for their good support the extended warranty shows that they are taking responsibility for it so I am understanding however dot dot dot dot dot dot the expected time I will get my Burke 360 back is over one month also did Microsoft say they have fixed the problem with the new Xbox 360s if so I intended to shell out for a new 360 instead the good point to my 360 dying is that I finally have dug out my old ps2 some of the games seem unusually unusual now and look bad graphics another thing is that the PlayStation controller seemed tiny if using the Xbox 360 controllers alone for five to six months dude you want to see tiny try playing with a dual analog controller for the Saturn and everything will look tiny to you trust me also a note on an email last week I fully support younger online players who are online I am now 15 I can truthfully say that I am definitely more mature than than other even 30 year old players who use the n-word and anyway I'm not going to let this go on really long so by necky PS this is good gramming speller lol's I'm not well I could point them out but I'm not going to because I'm not I'm too doped up to be a bitch tonight and PBS look for me in the chat room I saw you there I was gonna say something hi necky you're so lying you didn't look I did no I even voiced him all right and necky is one of our listeners from the UK so to be in our chat room right now dude your parents know you're up oh there was a question there but the Xbox 360 and and having three well have they fixed the problem on Xbox 360 I believe they have didn't they change the chips that were on in the Xbox 360 as part of to change that problem Loki am I wrong they didn't change chips they changed the heatsinks that were on the graphics chips and stuff and all the new ones um have been are being fixed I guess so then the new system shouldn't have this problem theoretically unless there's something else that goes wrong all right well we'll see what happens so that's it for email yes right right email the Rob D and chat confirms they changed the heatsinks so heat distribution is different there you go I have an email you have an email yeah I got it right here okay it says dear orange lounge radio what's up I'm going to comic-con it's gonna be awesome well I thought maybe if you need me to do something down there for you guys I could

sack and I want you to push Siler into the sack and bring them back to Sacramento video games and then have them here what it actually has nothing to do with video games but it has to do with the wellness and well-being of our program oh but I already said I want Siler here in my house when I get back I claimed Siler I'm sorry you suck and all the BSG people I like oh and the 4,400 people I just want so I'm totally I totally get here helo there you go so anybody going to comic-con have fun I'll be having fun for at least one of those days the heroes in Battlestar Galactica panel days

says me Galatav should get the comic-con only penny arcade poster for OLR yeah I want to do that what work on that what good penny arcade I hate them why they're really big jerks in real life when I was in line with that with one of the guys I'm buying a hamburger at e3 two years ago what yeah I've never had a bag so what did you what happened with you um I was in the one-up little party thing they had one year yeah that in itself is bad but they're just like all arrogant and cocky and not like the adorable kind like me but like the why are you sure no lie are you sure you're not getting that mixed up with mega 64 no I know those guys I thought were dick I know what penny arcade people look like okay so I mean maybe I just caught them at a bad time I didn't really talk to them my friend was talking to them but they were just arrogant and I didn't like like when I met those guys from a mega 64 I didn't know who they were and they were like offended because my friend I was with knew who they were and I was like who are these like why are you so excited and they were like offended I didn't know when all right anyway hey son of dad says comic-con will have a big Capcom presence if you like Capcom well there you go with the Phoenix Wright panel and everything is there other Capcom stuff um I don't know cuz there's like some Mega Man cosplay but once again I said I would punch them cry for oh that's gonna be there yeah I'll go play that I really wasn't planning on doing anything video game related except for some producer of the Ace Attorney series is going to be autographing things and so that's why I want to go over to their booth and I know Konami is doing something but I don't know if it's anything beyond Yugi crap so maybe some Silent Hill if I cross my fingers enough do you think there might be anything Disney related possibly that could show up I don't know wonder what you're hinting at I don't know I don't know what you could possibly be hinting at I don't go on the internet well I just happen to know that he is a very popular cartoon series and you know could possibly have a relation there I don't know all right let's go to a break
