and welcome to another week of orange lounge radio we are that internet radio program
dedicated to video games video gaming and gaming culture and the gamer
lifestyle that's a whole lot we've tried to fit a lot into this program but
that's why we're always split up into two parts when you listen to us on our
downloadable podcast or if you listen live on Sunday nights you get like three
and a half hours of radio just us here my name is Rob Roberts you might know me
as Sky out joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura Jamie Summers hi
and how are you hi hi are you high on drugs I am but legal ones yeah their
prescription we wouldn't endorse doing the other kind of drugs because that's
bad okay not publicly yes all right also joining us say hello to tech master
Loki low how are you doing okay fine had a good week yes sort of okay that's kind
of cryptic and also joining us tonight he hasn't been here for a little while
but he's joining us for tonight I know he's gonna be the whole show or what but
say hello to me let off how are you I'm fine it's been a long time since we've
had you on the show yeah like two weeks yeah so for those that have never heard
well you you haven't like actually sat in on a full show in a long long oh yeah
that's true and you're actually like really loud tonight I am that's kind of
something I'm booming that's right he's miklotov uses a very quiet voice we have
to like turn up the volume all the way yes um now for those that haven't heard
the show before miklotov works for konami and does DDR stuff yes that's all
we can really say but they're closing soon right yes so are you leaving or
what's going on can you say I don't know I don't know if I can say or not so I'm
gonna choose to not say anything all right all right I won't put you on the
spot I know that your co-workers might listen I want you get busted I don't
care if they listen all right well maybe thoughts here cuz he likes games he's
not just here to dish on I'm actually here because I was up here for Harry
Potter let's I suppose it's inevitable because somebody was noticing hi chat
room by the way our chair was available to chat orange laundry calm lots of
first-time listeners tonight I was noticing some folks saying it was our
first time listening so hello to all of you first-time listeners in chat it's
kind of a smaller audience in chat tonight though what I was thinking maybe
part of that is that people are reading Harry Potter right now they are they
should actually be done with it because it's been out for like two days so you
finished an hour before I before I left the house oh my gosh so you finished the
book about two hours ago so both of you finished the book yeah I finished about
this afternoon sometime and I don't read the books I would have been been done
last night but I had to play D&D I just wanted to get done with it because then
I could go back on the internet and not get spoiled by things I know I hate all
of you spoiler people yes and no spoilers in chat tonight don't even try
to be funny it's not cool so please don't ruin the book for those haven't
finished yet you know there's a lot to ruin I could kill I will Avada Kedavra
your ass I went directly to the spoiler page as soon as I found it you know I
don't know it's part of me I like to be spoiled and find out what's gonna happen
I don't even really read the book so watch the movies I haven't seen the
newest one in fact I didn't see the fourth one either but I like the first
three movies they're cool the fifth movie sucks now Jamie did you actually
go to the bookstore at midnight to buy the book no I was smart and went on
Amazon oh so you had to deliver to your house yes I went to Barnes and Noble
because I was also high on Vicodin I couldn't drive to the bookstore
although Dan said that he went to Walmart and almost bought me one the
Rob D says spoiler Jesus dies on page 681 oh you weren't looking for Bible
spoilers get it I think I saw that I think I saw that same joke on dig this
week failed I'm just kidding no but I went I went to Barnes and Noble at about
1030 on Friday and there were already a ton of people there because I wasn't
there to buy Harry Potter smelly people there was the fattest Hermione I'd ever
seen in my life was there actually so but I went bought the book for stardust
because I got to see a sneak preview of that movie that's coming out a couple
weeks stardust and I loved it it was like a video game I had Sky Pirates like
Final Fantasy 12 it was awesome and like magic and Michelle Pfeiffer was which it
was great so I I wanted to get the book that it was based on and they had it at
Barnes and Noble but then like I had to like go through crowds and crowds of
people it was crazy why did you go on Harry Potter night because I was there I
went to two Barnes and Nobles for Harry Potter night we went to eat at dos
coyotes was like right next door to Barnes and Noble so we just decided to
go there I was like I want to get the stardust book right now I was there too
waiting with my wife for the book and I was playing Final Fantasy well that
makes you a nerd too I waited in the Harry Potter line last year and I
already bought my British one online and I ended up the still wasn't as bad as
the Dreamcast line in 99 the Dreamcast line I sat and read books I just walked
into games or EB games when James came out so did I I just was like we did the
midnight thing at a GameStop I don't think Wichita is big enough for that
looking in chat room uninvited says we handed out cupcakes for our book release
at Walmart and this old smelly lady came up and ate like 12 one per person unless
you ordered 12 books or had a little sign or something but that just kind of
reminded me of the time the we came out and we were handing out you know the
soda and the doughnuts and smelly people it was some were smelly but not at the
target we ended up staying it was they were all well well-bathed it's too cold to be smelly cuz
when it's cold you can't really smell people as badly as when it's hot like
anime conventions I think that fanboy funk is worse in the summer if you let
it sit out for a little while all right boy funk does not take summer vacation
all right let's let's talk about video games we're like more than five minutes
in the show we haven't talked about video games just been that I said Final
Fantasy video games are video games too but they're not good cuz why is why
isn't there a good Harry Potter game cuz they're made by you haven't made me
design one that's not mean that it's a bad it should be a bad game if it's made
by you know it's the fact that they take franchises and and don't care about them
they're just like oh give me money on them yeah here was now here was the
nerdiest thing ever though we were at claim jumper last night or whatever and
we were going around the table going like what what house would you be in if
you were in Harry Potter probably in sparkly poo there is no sparkly poo you
have to read the fanfiction whatever anyway so we thought why isn't Harry
Potter like an MMO why isn't there an MMO set in the Harry Potter universe
millions of people would play it if they could be you could have like actual like
Quidditch and doing quests in the Harry Potter universe why isn't there actually
a game on ps2 is fun to exactly whatever it was I don't think the universe would
be that big I mean it'd be Hogwarts and well I guess you could you could have a
bunch of other school there are other schools so well now there's not gonna be
any more books why not have you know why not have an MMO in the Harry Potter
universe hmm who says it's not coming I mean look at Lord of the Rings online I
did the quiz that was on the Warner Brothers site and I got Slytherin I
didn't think I did the quiz I got Ravenclaw I was like what the fuck's a
Ravenclaw even smarter because they're also sneaky all right let's get to
actual like video game chat I will start with how was your gaming week dark
soccer how is your games what games I've been high on Vicodin all week so I
haven't played anything not even pinball I did well no I played World Cup soccer
see there's something but I am Ally so I can't really do much gaming all right
well that's all right Loki how was your gaming week I played paper Mario on the
virtual console not exactly like super paper Mario a little bit disappointing
but I don't know it's tolerable for right now I guess I think if I played
that right after I played Super Mario RPG I would have been greatly
disappointed then I played Final Fantasy I'm actually most the way through the
game now what else did I do gaming related I fully disassembled a PSP and
put it back together again because I was thinking I let me put this way I have
charge cables for my PSP but they're at work and I want to play Final Fantasy my
battery was low so I was going to make my own charge cable but then I couldn't
find this my car adapter cable that was going to hack apart for the second half
of it so I was like well I could just solder some stuff on to the USB port on
to the PSP and just solder that to the power port and then it should be able to
charge via USB so I took that all apart and got fascinated with that I'm like
crap this is not going to go back together again is it so I put it back
together and I think it's working now except for some reason though when I put
the USB charge cable I bought today on it it wasn't lighting up so I don't know
if that's just the battery that's in there that's so dead they won't charge
with that or what but hopefully it works otherwise that's my you know parts PSP
anyway so I gotta sell it so I can get a new one then other than that I tried
playing oh I played Super Rub-a-dub on ps3 crap is that one of those new
downloadable games the one with the Ducks or whatever yes it's the one the
Ducks it's actually a game rap yeah it's it's stupid what do you do in the game
you tilt using the six axis because that's almost every single game that's
downloadable on the PSP right now or ps3 you tilt the six axis to make the Ducks
go around you collect ducks and get to the drain it is crap is so fucking hard
to control it's not fun luckily I didn't download the full game I download the
demo so no money lost is it the Ducks from the old first PlayStation demo they
had from every single demo that they've done so far ducks have been all of them
she's running gag and now it's a game no the game still running gag it's crap
that's what it is gk 128 in our chat room agrees with you super rub-a-dub for
the lose he also gk 128 says the controlling super rub-a-dub is so bad it
doesn't even follow your movements right it doesn't and it's just way too
sensitive so no thanks I ended up selling a lot or I sold back
Motorstorm today you know now I'm just stuck with resistance which is you know
great game but I just you know my PlayStation 3 right now is being treated
like my PSP except my PSP has more gaming going along with it because I
don't buy games anymore for it if only they had that for the oh I thought I'm
thinking about modding my weight that might be something that's coming on mod
chips I can play some import games at times all right me go Todd you want to
share with us your gaming week if anything I've still been trying to think
if I played anything this week besides Wow and I don't think I did so I played
Wow what happened in Wow well it made me sad because I decided to level up my
tailoring and there's this one piece of cloth I can only make every three days
in 22 hours so I'm waiting for that time limit to be up I'm just being
disgruntled the whole time while I wait and that's it all right aren't you
exciting I am what's up it's something in the air and not a lot of game playing
this week well I do that at work so I guess that's true I could see that I got
a game what'd you get I got Marvel to moon Alliance for Xbox 360 but I didn't
get the gold one cuz Dan was being a cheap but and he said that I could just
download Hawkeye cuz it's really a character I care about okay so instead
downloading the uber thing that had everybody you can just get the one
character you want yeah I haven't played it yet also play Call of Duty 3
multiplayer for a little bit and there's one cool kill they had we were playing
on eater dam and I was driving the Jeep across it and about to jump the little
gap in the middle and then someone shot me in the head luckily for me I fell out
of the Jeep of course I was dead but my Jeep went forward and went over the
jump and ran them over so it was a double kill is hilarious and then of
course grant up that advice series stories still playing that's still
yelling at everybody nerd my gaming week I tried some of the new downloads that
are available on Xbox live marketplace like Bomberman live but I only really
played the demo for Bomberman about download full game so I don't really
want to give a full review but it definitely already right off the bat was
way better than act zero that's for sure even just the demo the free demo is
better than the $60 act zero so I was pleased with that it's like 20 bucks now
still $20 too much that's still $20 too much for that game but it's cool you
know it's it's it's classic Bomberman so if you remember Bomberman from Super
Nintendo days I did notice though that when you do buy the regular version of
it you're gonna be able to customize the game to hell like you know you just
customize like any type of environment you want to play in and different types
of power-ups that are available and all that it's highly customizable so
definitely a great tournament game I'm also played the ER kung-fu although I
didn't buy the full version because I can play the full version on my computer
because I have it through you know game to happen what have you I just checked
out I did like I thought the new graphics are pretty cool but otherwise
it's not really a game I'm very fond of from back in the day I mean like snow
those ones that's like stood up against the test of time yeah you know I've I've
I've I've defended time pilot and even Russian attack to an extent on this show
but I just can't find my love for ER kung-fu not when there's other fighting
games you know like Street Fighter 2 that are better and especially this HD
remix on the way and so that I'm sure gonna be pretty awesome they need to put
the grid on Xbox live pretty rad and the Rob Dean chat says a ER kung-fu is awful
JV Mon says it sucks ass back in the day back in the day I preferred it to kung-fu
master yeah I way perverted to kung-fu master but just now I just I can't you
know like sometimes I try to I find my retro game love for the simple games but
like ER kung-fu is not one of those games I can just find my love for again
because I guess I never really have there's some of these games on live that
they seem to forget about like you know oh yeah there's downloadable content
coming later and it never does like boom boom rocket I thought there's more songs
it's funny you should mention that because that's another game I got really
into this week randomly like I haven't played boom boom rocket in months and
then this week I was looking at my the high scores and I noticed that I'd
fallen not just to second place within my own friends list but third place
though my own friends list I'm like at one point I had a score in the top 100
okay so I was like alright I got to play this some more and try to improve my
score so I did and I'm back up to second place now within my friends and now I
gotta try and get back up to first place so I'm working on it playing some more
songs but yeah there's no downloadable stuff for boom and rocket at all it's
kind of sad because I'm not a big fan of the tracks that come with the game I
even went to GameStop today I was like I got to get me in another game because I
had I had like Forza 2, Shadowrun and like Tenchu Z and Monster Madness
Bell for suburbia all brand new copies that I got from work but it's like I
don't want to play any of this even Forza 2 I was like well I could maybe
design some cars or something like no that's no I'm not gonna get suckered
into playing this just like I did Project Gotham Racing 3 although Project
Gotham Racing 4 that looks pretty good too but I'm gonna get suckered in buying
that and hate it and then return it back either way to get one of those game
rental accounts doesn't matter I'm gonna get it probably you know Microsoft games
they usually get for free all right JV Mon and Chad agrees with me by the way
that the tracks that come with the game are pretty boring so you go that one I
like is really good I don't know smooth operetta yes smooth operetta yeah that's
a great surprise Konami hasn't done like well I guess they wouldn't want to do
that because of what a downloadable DDR something yeah because they would
compete with their own game so why can't they do a downloadable beat mania or
something even though you know I know there's a special controller comes with
it and all but you know why not do like a button friendly version I don't know I
guess I'm being stupid the other game I got really into randomly this week was
Carcassonne I finally went back and played the demo more fully for that and
I downloaded I ended up spending the cash to get the full game of Carcassonne
because I got more into it into it than I did Settlers of Catan but I'll tell
you this I suck at Carcassonne I am so horrible at that game like it took me
forever to get the strategy down to that game I finally beat the computer in a
match but I'm like in last place I've gone from boom boom rocket a game where
I'm second place amongst all my friends to Carcassonne where I'm in last place
amongst all my friends because I'm just not that good at it I'm still trying to
figure out the strategy to it but I'm having fun like I like the fact that
it's like a board game but it kind of has its own like you know the you
basically the way Carcassonne is is that you're building a puzzle every time and
that puzzle involves cities and roads and monasteries and all this stuff and
you draw out these cards in a random order and play them down and so you know
roads have to connect to other roads cities have to connect to other cities
and when you claim roads or claim cities and finish them you get a lot of points
for them so it's kind of cool like I've got to play it on Xbox Live and I'm
afraid to cuz I know I'll get my ass handed to me but I guess that's the only
way you're gonna get better at a game like that so but I've been having fun
playing it so yay Carcassonne that's it for my gaming week so we will move from
our gaming weeks to some housekeeping first off we want to thank or
congratulate I should say one of our longtime listeners DDR angel I don't
know if you remember DDR angel I should hope not at all I should hope so she was
here for the longest time she got married today so I'm gonna say
congratulations congratulations miss DDR angel and her husband who by the way
goes online I believe by big red pimp now she's DDR pimp lady yes now she's
DDR pimp so congratulations to DDR miss DDR pimp also no show next week we're
not gonna be doing any show next week there may be a best-ever something that
shows up on the archives that there's time but unfortunately just due to
other obligations there will be no show on July 29th so we're very sorry about
that dark soccer is going to Disneyland again but I am and I'm gonna be high as
a kite there too and usually we would just go ahead and do a show if one of us
is gone but also we're moving this is the very last show you're gonna hear
from studio number three which we've had you know a good couple of years here
we've been here for about two years in this tiny little room but the show
basically if you haven't caught on takes place in my spare bedroom and my
apartment and in a couple weeks it will take place in the spare bedroom or maybe
garage haven't figured it out yet at my new house so I'm very excited about that
kind of moving on up so we will be in the new studio soon that'll be studio
number four so yes the show has been a lot of places over the past five years
so we're excited about that so kind of like a whore what do you mean a little
bit well to use it to use a friend of mine's analogy we're like the house
broom everyone's had a ride I get it all right well here's the thing also we're
looking to kind of relaunch of sorts in a couple weeks like not like we're gonna
totally redo the show but maybe try some new things like some new album art some
new openings some new incidental sounds and stuff that play throughout the show
so if you are a artistic or audio editing type please shoot us an email
because we'd be interested in what you can do for us in regards to it new
intros and new artwork and all that good stuff so more to come in two weeks when
we return with more orange lounge radio for now though let's get to the gaming
news for this week and I believe Loki's gonna start us off tonight yes so this
week there is a bunch of news coming out of Japan during their PlayStation
premiere event in Tokyo and some interesting things coming out mostly
stuff that we're not going to see over here one of which is a TV tuner for the
PSP it's actually a one seg tuner device and kind of attaches to the top of via
the USB port much like the GPS receiver and camera and apparently you can tune
into different TV stations and one that's supposed to be coming out in
September and that's kind of cool wish it we'd get something like that over
here me something third-party I know why is it that we're not getting any stuff
over here yes never came out over here either and I don't think the camera did
either so maybe we're just not into all those things over here we I know we care
about high-tech gadgets over here but not like Japan does that's why we get
two colors of things sometimes three Japan gets a hundred and fifty eight
versions a week but TVs are kind of cool I don't know I might make the PSP a
little more lucrative it depends how much it costs how much does it cost in
Japan I was 6,900 yen that's about what $69 right I'm not mistaken yeah all
right oh by the way it's only compatible with the new PSP not the old one not
that it really matters because in September it's gonna be replacing all
the old ones anyways gee Sony likes to do that replace old stuff oh yeah like
they're the only company out there that redesigns their systems Nintendo I'm
looking at you all right but they make them better and in better colors speaking
of better colors there are more PSP color variations coming out in Japan you
know how we're getting what we're getting like three colors here two
colors in a in the Star Wars okay well over there they're getting piano black
ceramic white and ice silver but they're also getting the bloom series with rose
pink lavender purple and Felicia blue I want that blue one so bad but this
sounds like bubble bath salts colors it's so pretty this sounds like
something a housewife would pour in her bathtub and say Calgon take me away PS
Sony take me away have salt and bubbles because it would not make bubbles well
whatever but still it sounds like baths I'm getting bath salts and bubble baths
mixed up okay so that's six variants on the new PSP and they already had like at
least four of the regular PSP and so I can't help but feel we're really getting
shafted when Sony is doing better over here than they are in Japan well it is
launching in Japan on September 29th 19,800 yen and any of those colors that
you want there's also some new accessories coming out AV cable super
video cable D cable component cable now that's pretty awesome there's a
component cable coming out for the video out not just there is that's pretty rad
they'll do 480p god now I want one just for the video out so I can play Silent
Hill but not it was Silent Hill origins I can play the Akumajo Dracula
compilation game that's coming out what what nothing whatever all that I can
play all that crap on the TV I'm very excited playing that game for a long
time already but it's sexy sexy remake but the original is better whatever it's
pretty shush original has Maria's crappy singing in it well maybe one of her
weapons is a song book and she kills things by going wow I think I almost
died a little right that's exactly what her voice sounds like to you well
anyway anyway um I'm sorry I'm all giggly today no um there is a little bit
of good news for our friends in Europe the PSP will actually be out there it
beginning of September and in Japan it will be there on September 20th so you
guys get it first you can just go rub it in everybody's face so Europe actually
gets something first for once they got stuff first before remember a few games
well nami loves Europe for some reason they get a lot of the cool stuff this
has nothing to do with konami no but it's Europe does get stuff first
sometimes what's that wow but the the price is gonna be the same as the
current ones it's a 129.99 what colors are they getting it does not say oh also
and not much of a surprise since we're getting the stupid Star Wars PSP over
here that Japan would get something a little bit cooler in the special Final
Fantasy 7 system set which will be coming out bundled with crisis core and
has some fancy Final Fantasy 7 crisis core artwork on it also it's gonna be a
limited production there are only making 77,777 units you know why that is right
because it's Final Fantasy 7 and it's not because 7 is the most powerful magic
number is beside that actually there was in Final Fantasy 7 if you got I've only
heard of this happening if you got your hit points all to seven then you did
some special attack for in the game the special attack was called go outside and
buy more sequels of this game when it comes out I'm gonna find it so I'm
looking I'm just looking at chat room now and going back to some old comments
here the Rob D says I want to see Maria and Kirby in a sing-off and the dark
no cuz no dark Tatsuya wants to add jigglypuff to that no Maria sings worse
than all of them let's see and chainsaw juggling said I did that once it was
awesome in reference to the lucky sevens there see I knew it was in there
drunami says seven seven seven HP send your character into a constant attack
mode yeah it's awesome all right well even though they are getting that super
cool Final Fantasy 7 slim thing PSP in Japan everybody is hopefully getting
this it's an expansion to Metal Gear Solid portable ops course a lot of folks
are big fans of this game on the PSP because it wasn't Metal Gear acid and it
was actually more like the other Metal Gear games a lot of folks are really
into this your acid though had the cool 3d thing I cool is relative and that
cooler headache inducing I know if I wear that thing too long I would
definitely have to take some Vicodin for the headaches I'm gonna be getting after
using that too much so there you go now IGN is actually reporting from the
PlayStation premiere event in Tokyo that this new portable ops game is going to
have some online play and that's going to be kind of its focus there's going to
be some new characters possibly an older version of snake and there's only going
to be a little bit more as far as the single-player mode goes the infinity
mission otherwise it's the good old-fashioned Metal Gear Solid
portable ops that you're used to they do have old snake from Metal Gear Solid 4 in
there he's in the trailer awesome September 20th is the day that comes out
hmm I seem to remember something else is coming out that day in Japan as well
there it is probably take a little bit longer for it to come out here though
because you know Konami hates you and they did some little thing in the yes
and they did something in the video where it's like Power Rangers for the
trailer that makes me want to play it now dang it well other stuff for anyone
who cares is that there is actually going to be a Metal Gear Solid online
for ps3 they had a little demo of it out when they did the Metal Gear Solid 4
thing so if anybody cares there you go you can all wander around with boxes
over your heads I get you know and your truck can start to move could Metal
Gear Solid ever be like a first-person shooter someday it was when do you
remember the VR missions they came out with a first-person version of metal in
Japan it did came out with the first person version of Metal Gear Solid it
just kind of makes me think like with all this like online and all that stuff
could this be like a new halo I don't know for a certain audience I don't know
it's a little silly I would say it's more like Splinter Cell or you know
recon some but I don't know I think I'd play it a lot if it was I know Metal
Gear Solid is one of those series but I don't get into the Tom Clancy games as
much I don't get into them I don't get into that stuff either like the old-ass
Metal Gear I used to love house does I don't I don't get into those games as
much although the solid I it would be kind of cool to implement that into our
website the what the solid I for the you know
Melger acid to that that freaking headache inducing thing the thing though
but it makes it 3d so I'd be kinda neat a little silly it would be jvmon says
first-person shooters suck though that's an opinion that's an opinion some of
them are fun some of them do suck but some are fun I love hexen I love like
quake 3 that game was badass and Duke Nukem 3d hello why do you think so many
people are crazy about doing them forever
blaze says correction halo sucks Gears of War is amazing see I don't know I
think I could not get into Gears of War at all so I could not get into it
I try crazy fun I tried so hard anyways so of course last week you know there's
a whole debacle about you know the 68 system being phased out in the 88 system
coming into place
well there's some interesting commentary about the whole thing coming from Sony
Computer Entertainment Europe's president David Reeves in fact he's
actually been on record saying you know the difference between 60 and 80
gigabytes is very small we're just we just feel like going up 20 gigabytes is
not worth it you're gonna double it then it's worth it so basically you know
obviously he's commenting on the fact that I don't think the 80 system is
coming to Europe I think they're going to be doing something a little bit
larger but at the same time you see oh by the way yeah you probably don't need
to buy it for another extra 20 why doesn't he just admit we don't have 20
gigs worth of shit for you to put on here there really is not that much stuff
to download that's what I don't get I you know if I would think it now I don't
know I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner and I haven't been reading up very well but
does the PlayStation 3 allow you to play movies like from your computer yeah it
does anything like any type of movie it's limited but you can play stuff from
your computer you copy them to the PlayStation 3 drive or anything you can't
download them from your networking copy him but you can download some on there
like I have a rip copy of kung pao on my hard drive that can play off there but
nothing officially endorsed by Sony I don't think there's any movies that you
can download from Sony like let's say on my xbox 360 I can watch wmv files of a
certain type over the network and watch them on my TV right yeah but on the Sony
I can do that with certain other types of movies yeah why doesn't Sony just
blow the door wide open on that and just leave it unlimited to what you get like
put all the different codex in there to what you can watch and people would like
love that and they could copy movies to their drive and everything I don't know
my guy absurd I never understood why they bumped it up from 60 80 anyways
because I guess unless you know a lot of games really install themselves onto the
drive like I remember Ridge Racer did that and the oblivion I know does that
but I haven't really I don't have that many PlayStation 3 games so I can't say
if they all do that but if they did all do that then yeah that would fill up
pretty quick but at the same time as far as downloadable content that's available
on their PlayStation Store there's hardly anything on there I mean I check
maybe once every few months and there may be one or two things more on there
they're actually worth downloading Ravens Dolphin says what Sony is telling
the truth for once and the Rob D says MPAA sky but the MPAA you know what they
can't control what if I have a video I shoot on my digital camera that I want
to watch over on the TV you know they can't control that F the MPAA you know
those comments coming from our chat room chat dot orange lounge radio.com
something else maybe that could be a downloadable title I don't know the
early screenshots I'm seeing that this game look very simplistic it's from the
creator of Katamari Dimashii Kata Takahashi you might remember he said he
was taking a break to work on playgrounds remember that like he was
supposedly ended konmari Dimashii to go make playgrounds well I don't know if he
finished or what's going on but he is released information about a new game
for the PlayStation 3 no B no B boy now no B means stretch in Japanese so in the
early screenshots definitely look like this big stretching I don't know turdie
caterpillar thing stretching around so there's very little information on this
is right now but we do know that the creator of Katamari Dimashii is making a
new game for the PlayStation 3 that's about it so that's kind of interesting
because you know a lot of folks on PlayStation 3 were really sad because
there has been no news about beautiful Katamari coming out to their system in
fact now it looks like that whole project may have been scrapped so maybe
they'll get this new project instead which could be somewhat redemption for
them I don't know kind of interesting I think they're beyond redemption they
deserve to burn no thinking speaking of things that deserve to burn is a Gran
Turismo prologue is going to be available for Japanese PlayStation
Network in October we don't get it yet it will have online multiplayer and has
an undetermined price it is not free great you get to pay for a demo that's
awesome I just say it's more freaking cars so whatever project Gotham is more
fun why don't you release an actual game instead of all these demos that's what I
think another game that's coming out to PlayStation 3 at least was announced a
Disgaea 3 looks very similar to all the other Disgaea games and sadly enough the
graphics also look similar to the other Disgaea games meaning that they're not
that great but hey it's Disgaea it's another game hurrah yeah Disgaea was
never really about the graphics though it was a hilarious voice acting in the
stories and you know the game itself it was pretty awesome strategy it looks
okay I mean I don't know I would think though that if they're gonna step up to
PlayStation 3 they're gonna do something with the graphics make them uber sharp
or you know it does look a little sharper but then again the screenshots
so small I don't really know well there you go also coming for the PlayStation
3 at some point someday Tekken 6 Tekken 6 is going to be coming up I'm sorry oh
Tekken 6 is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and of course you know
Virtua Fighter is going to have online on the Xbox 360 so it just makes sense
that Virtua Fighter sucks PlayStation should have something going for it and
that's going to be Tekken 6 Namco Bandai answered at PlayStation Premiere in
Tokyo that they will have the online capability you know I don't think that
these should really be announcements anymore I think it should always be an
online game I mean this is what we Microsoft doesn't go out there and out
hey this game is gonna be online most of the games are online it's not something
that you really need to announce just get with it Sony or hell get with it
Namco I mean you should yeah because when everything online it's not Sony's
fault there was this big to-do about Soul Calibur finally going online too
and everybody's just kind of like yeah the last one really should have been
online right so I don't know that's like saying you know you know Tekken 6 is
gonna be in high definition okay great I thought it was supposed to be since it's
on you know the PlayStation 3 all right well whatever whatever it is you're into
we know that Dark Sakura is into this it's her website of the week and every
week Dark Sakura surfs the internet up and down and back and forth and finds a
website suitable of sharing with all of you it's called Dark Sakura's website of
the week and here it is my website of the week because I couldn't concentrate
long enough to actually pick a real site so I picked a version of the site I
picked before and it's ROFL cats calm it's more lol cats so there you go more
Caturday first to spread the badly grammar spelling cat captioning fun
because we've really not had any of that on this show ever not a long time this
is pretty funny stuff because it has like a couple my favorites on there like
like what show me one show me a funny one I'll be the judge at this site the
judge jury and executioner she's looking folks the justice system or fucking
screwed super cat I don't know I don't know I like going to kitten or dot-com
or whatever it's called that gets me through the day sometimes what kitten
war yeah cuz they put two it's like a like a rate your cat site and they put
two pictures of cats of you say which one's cuter it's adorable okay one more
oh now that's funny that's why I see it's a picture of Winnie the Pooh and
you're saying take up please yeah that's funny all right your psych is that
acceptable I will allow this site is Rob pleased with my offering I have it
ceiling cat is very pleased with your offering next story please I don't get
that crap anyways it's not surprising we talked a little bit about this last week
there was a survey that went out to all the attendees of e3 this year kind of
asking them their opinions on certain things that they're possibly going to
change for next year of the following they were offering new locations
including Santa Monica San Diego Laguna Beach San Francisco or LA also they were
prefer our question was do you prefer to see the summit held in multiple hotel
settings like it was this year or a convention center type larger facility
setting I know I'll probably speak for Bobby insane larger facility convention
center type setting instead of having to drive between hotels and says also
they're talking about what month you like you know options included May
through August and then of course if you didn't visit Barker hangar or the
Fairmount Hotel why not I hope it comes to because I was stuck in traffic I
wasn't invited he'll get a link to the survey so we can fill out I wasn't
invited I didn't visit it because it's eight hours away too far although I did
not find it interesting that you one of the choices was San Francisco and you've
been begging and pleading for it to come to San Francisco's that way cuz you're
lazy and you don't have to you know flyer anything you could just drive
driver to LA for a convention I will I swear I'll only fly to LA ever again
because I hate that drive so horrible I drive great on that drive is the most
boring drive is pretty boring you probably take the five yeah five is
pretty boring but 99 is not much better 99 has great truck stops on the way and
you meet all kinds of colorful people it's like five is like field field field
field mountain field field field smell and cow like by what was it that Marissa
called it a cow shwits cow shwits the town of Kohling a beautiful stuff
anyway the Rob D is saying they've never driven in Illinois have they hostile
on her miss here the people in Illinois don't know how to drive at all son of
dad says e-308 in Vegas for the win I would not mind e-308 in Vegas I don't
think Vegas would work oh why not but it's Vegas well they just did was it the
ESA thing there or EMA camera what is the video kind of their big convention
in Vegas and it sucks in Vegas everything's way expensive and act deaf
says e3 in Mexicali Mexico hell yeah e3 in Mexico let's have it in Tijuana that
would rock I'm gonna go to Mexico this year for what world pump finals they
moved it out of Korea this year and they're putting it in Mexico so I'm
gonna have to you know bring soap and something to keep the dirtiness away and
a water filter horrible and a water you guys are horrible I'm sure those
stereotypes are not true it's always gamer day at Easter Island it's so
fitting mmm blaze says e3 in Canada so Rob can get more maple cookies I like
that idea e3 in Canada requires leaving nothing
against Canada but they're not gonna have anything up there ever they have
red PlayStations I live Canada I wouldn't to Brad I will take California
drivers over Alabama drivers any day all right Florida drivers may I move on may
I do a new story no no one thing you might remember we were all giddy about
on this program about a year ago was the Silent Hill movie remember Silent Hill
came out we were all excited because his pyramid had like right there it's not
four times you know he cut the shit out of people and rip that lady's skin off
it was awesome and so of course we were excited about a Silent Hill 2 coming out
but now I don't know how excited this is gonna make people about Silent Hill 2
because Christoph Ganz has said I'm sorry I don't have the time to do Silent
Hill 2 so he's not gonna be doing this is good news to you yes why cuz I didn't
think he did a great job with the first one that's all right you know what you
know who's wrapping up filming on Far Cry ooh a bowl yeah god I hope he's
available somebody just needs to shoot that man in the head yeah careful what
you have to understand in Silent Hill now will be setting will be setting the
jungle on an island so be a rave there someone needs to strap that man down and
lobotomize the section of his brain that controls writing movies oh wait they
already did that explains his last few movies well anyway since Christoph Ganz
is not on the next film Roger Avery took a hike as well now see what's going on
is that Ganz has said to a French magazine DVD Rama that the sequel was
ordered by Sony but he's kind of too busy with other movies like Onimusha
which he's adapting that game as well obviously um so he can't do it he said
this quote if I cannot take on Silent Hill 2 myself the director who does
would need to continue in the same style as the first film and then make you
excited Jane one does not want that crappy did get the style right one does
not want to make a Hollywood style movie and I think that it makes sense if the
director of the sequel is European in the best case scenario French so there
it is and Roger Avery said if I'm not gonna do Silent Hill 2 if Christoph's
not gonna do it that's fine we don't need them they just go the way of the
Resident Evil movies I know Resident Evil is bad because they don't really
follow well anything it's kind of gone on its own tangent but it'd be cool like
if Silent Hill kind of took over the world and then you have people trying to
survive all these mutated evil things not everybody enjoyed the Silent Hill
movie though I know a lot of people did and I liked it those well then they can
just make a sequel from me exactly they should have me write it it's just it
just stars pyramid head seriously they should have me where I will write it's
pyramid head gone wild honestly they just need to look at the second game and
then take the dialogue and then add some scenes where the action takes place and
there you got you got your second movie but what I don't want it to turn into is
I don't want Silent Hill Silent Hill series to turn into like the Halloween
series where it's just like pyramid head kills everything you know a pyramid head
at summer camp killing lovely young ladies now if they wanted to spin off
series I'm all fine with that Freddy versus Jason versus pyramid head oh you
know they both die cuz pyramid heads awesome I'll be awesome because nobody
can kill a pyramid head he has to end up offing himself
son of dad says a Luca Besson Silent Hill would own wasn't he the guy that
did the fifth element I'd be pretty hot that would be hot hmm maybe maybe we
shall see Bruce Willis as pyramid head no Bruce Willis versus pyramid head that
would be fun cuz then no John McLean versus pyramid head cuz nobody would
die hard fun they just take out the whole fucking world between them okay so
so I guess what else keep speaking of you know weird bizarreness that episode
is South Park where they did the World of Warcraft thing which I finally saw
two days ago is up for an Emmy glad she's on top of it I don't watch TV I
have to either be really bored or high on Vicodin to watch TV and I was high
as a kite on okay for to explain to people who are listening I broke two
ribs so I'm currently medicated so that's why I sound like a goofball
tonight and I was bored enough tonight hey shut up and I was I was so bored
that I decided to watch the South Park episode of World of Warcraft what the
other way around you know what I mean did live up to your expectations it was
kind of funny but there was stuff that was wrong but I did think it was your
son's character is going to die I was like oh shit bathroom bathroom I know
people who get like that is so stupid so I thought it was funny but so does it
deserve an Emmy no what's the Emmy for I don't know this is nominated for one
it's just got nominated for one who cares the poop award for animated
defecation awesome well there's gonna be some good stuff coming out this week
not a whole lot but some pretty good stuff in the u.s. if you're a fan of the
NASCAR series you'll be happy to know there's a new game coming out from EA
NASCAR 08 on a PlayStation 2 360 and the PlayStation 3 also on PlayStation 2 this
week shimagane tensei persona 3 which I meant to play this week but never got
around to it that is also coming out and then a small little game called guitar
hero encore rocks the 80s that's gonna be making its way out on PlayStation 2
and then let's see here on the PSP we have Final Fantasy 2 which I'm trying to
finish Final Fantasy 1 so I can play this alien certain syndromes gonna be
coming out on the Wii and PSP also a weird game from Eidos called escape from
bug Island which you may know as a necron Asia wasn't very good in Japan so
now it's mediocre over here and I'm not really surprised of this but yet another
tycoon games coming out on PC ride carnival tycoon and yeah let's ride
friends forever yet another horse riding game yay horse riding games and dynasty
warriors DS on the DS I totally misheard that title by the way would you hear it
as miss let's what ride friends and I don't know let's ride friends let's ride
friends forever let horses ride friends that's that's wrong no where is your
where is your mind what are you sure you're only on by get in I'm sure and a
sieve and civilization for expansion pack will also be coming out this week
as well sieve for beyond the sword all right well coming out over in Japan are
some games this week on July 26th for the Xbox 360 Major League Baseball 2k7
and finally you asked for it the Elder Scrolls for oblivion is coming out in
Japan localized for Japan so you guys finally get that I know you're excited
about that July 26th on the Xbox 360 also coming out on some of the other
systems on the Wii Dewey's adventure makes its debut over in Japan which is
not a good game it's no really I don't like it one bit why don't you like it I
just don't like the controls at all I think it's a cute game and it's
definitely Ella bits ish but it's it's not fun to set the Wii's problem or is
that the game's problem because I noticed a lot of it's not the Wii's
problem I mean this could have been done with a 6-axis too I just don't think the
last time I played it the controls were tight enough also coming out in Japan
Mario Party 8 guilty gear double X accent core and some jigsaw puzzle games
coming out from Hudson Entertainment mobile suit Gundam and just for you
Jamie Puyo Puyo 15th anniversary I love on the Nintendo Wii yeah but seriously I
mean seriously how many of those Puyo Puyo games I have a bunch of Puyo Puyo
games I even have the PC Engine one coming out on the PlayStation 3 Major
League Baseball 2k7 Mina no golf 5 and one gun midnight is coming out on
the PlayStation 3 shit I want to practically import that game I was
awesome I love the arcade series screenshots for that and I thought that
was kind of interesting it looks like it's the first game though I don't know
how would you practically import it like just get the instruction book well cuz
PlayStation 3 is free order with all sorts of practicality like if I'm gonna
rationalize getting a PlayStation 3 that's one of the games that would
actually make me want to do it because I love that I don't know if it's region
free for the games though that's the only thing god damn it I'm not sure well
hold well this I thought it was region free for games not from the site says no
region protection well then awesome I'm gonna have to import that fuck yeah oh
yeah well me too well fuck yeah twice uh-huh anyway I don't want to fuck yeah
twice PlayStation 2 is getting a lot of stuff going into best hits but they're
getting some new games as well I believe this is new ikki tosen shining dragon is
coming out and then also the metal gear 20th anniversary collection metal gear
solid 2 Metal Gear Solid 3 and another your solid collection is all coming out
PlayStation our Phantasy Star Universe takes a price cut as it moves into the
best series and sanyo pachinko paradise 14 oh also another another game goes
into Sega ages this would be volume 30 galaxy force 2 in Japan you big fan of
galaxy force no I don't know Nintendo DS is getting a lot of games as well this
is a big release week for games over there a Taiko no Tatujin on the DS is
coming out over there and also this is great another Hello Kitty game this one
is called Hello Kitty no I shot a party Sanrio characters Zuka and DS isn't that
a mouthful it's an action game but it has all your favorite Hello Kitty
characters I see twin star I see kiropi but I don't see bats Maru so this game
fails let's see if there's anything on the PSP real quick alexa silvara and the
charm says Wangen midnight equals maximum tune to now not necessarily the
box art doesn't say its maximum tune to it just calls it when again mid get
midnight it's all-encompassing I don't know if it's all-encompassing or what it
is I would be the ideal I would think on the PlayStation 3 also look at more
information on this game with that up during the oh you looking that up right
now well I was looking at it is region free so it's not that expensive either
which is good I'm just like I don't know if it's all in Japanese or something
because some of those games can actually be in English as well I just I don't
have any careful well on the Sony PSP you finally get Grand Theft Auto Liberty
City Stories in Japan Capcom is bringing that to you I always think that's
interesting how that works intercontinental there how different
companies can bring the games see because the other game that I would like
to get also maybe would be folks all you know like folklore that's gonna be
coming over here well that's all I got for Japanese releases maybe I can get
well I have some European releases but only a few we have guilty your dust
strikers on DS guilty your judgment on PSP and they're finally getting the
pokey man's diamond and pearl which was also a print album I'm done wow I was
quick there's other games listed with with uh to be announced titles but you
know there's nothing really specific which I would assume that some of these
would already be out I would hope like Saints Row is listed for ps3 okay here's
the deal with Wangan midnight and all that is that I'm looking at Wikipedia
and apparently this is actually the third game in the series so this would
be like Wangan midnight maximum tune 3 it's going to be a simultaneous release
in the arcade PlayStation 3 and PSP hell yeah there it is that's pretty rad sign
me up that might be I might try that wouldn't it be amazing if they did that
for like a good series you don't like that game I don't care about I never
played it you've never played it then how can you knock it because the track
is amazing that's there I can knock it for that it's got a poetry song on it
why don't you know it's usual Shiro is she like getting one of the throat in it
maybe I doubt it it sounds like that in every song she sings I know but I doubt
it see drunami sets miklotov on fire in shed SSG 100 says lol Shane's being a
dick tonight tonight that's like I'm being a jerk again it never stops and I
know gosh I always have something negative to say I wondered why we hadn't
had you on this show in a long time and then I remembered why because I hate
things and stuff you hate things and stuff and stuff definitely and stuff and
stuff damn those things and stuff all right anyways move on to more news
please I want to end this segment so other things to hate x07s gone so where
are we gonna get some more news from Microsoft well yeah it's rumors around
the internet because they're always true exact eight and same goes with Sony
we'll get into that a little bit later but anyways um yeah there's no real x07
this year according to Microsoft exec Erin Greenberg instead they are going
to be trying to do some sort of other event that will be taking place in the
UK so yeah other event no already at Chuck E Cheese have Chuck E Cheese over
there I'm gonna Chuck E Cheese what are they I have Chuck E Cheese is nasty
pizza though but they do have this Mike's incredible or John's incredible
pizza or whatever it is yeah that new one here yeah we should go they don't
have that in the UK either do they have like Chuck E Cheese type places in the
UK what do they call you happy it's a time theater please please email me
right now I'm gonna go Chuck E Cheese to go play pump it up you know I was she
would know Jamie cuz you're like up on your British call but I don't care about
Chuck E Cheese all right I haven't cared about Chuck E Cheese since it was show
biz maybe somebody will email us and tell us let me know if you have pizza
time theater please all right in fact we give emails we're gonna get to the mail
bag very shortly here and I read the avalanche of emails that came into our
mailbox this week at mail bag at orange everybody but first this was a big story
here Peter Moore has left Microsoft that's right Peter Moore has been
become very well known lately it's kind of like the face of Microsoft and a lot
of these events and of course Peter Moore came to Microsoft from Sega which
drew all these comparisons about the Xbox 360 launch versus the Dreamcast
launch and so on well Peter Moore is actually left to move back to the Bay
Area so welcome back Peter Moore even though we're not technically in the Bay
Area we're close enough Peter Moore has come back to the Bay Area to be with his
family so what he's gonna do now he's going to head up EA Sports is what his
new role is going to be so even though he's gone from working for a giant you
know console maker to a publisher that's still nothing to blink at that's still a
very important role EA makes crap loads of money and if you're wondering who is
going to replace Peter Moore well it's going to be Don Matrick who comes from
EA he's coming from EA there you go and will be interesting to see if this has
any type of changes on Microsoft's PR but probably not probably not really
gonna be the same old stuff see a son of dad says Peter Moore quit to go work at
showbiz you know it's funny you know where Reggie Fils-Aime came from you
know one of the places he worked before he was at Nintendo Pizza Time Theatre
no Panda Express really yeah but I mean look at you know Panda Express is nasty
but it's everywhere now it's insanely popular so I don't know if that was his
doing or what but there you go no it was the doing it was people addicted to MSG
maybe all right anyhow I'll see we mentioned the mailbags coming up so
let's get into the mailbag dark soccer likes to read your emails that you send
this every week well dark soccer is forced at gunpoint to read your emails
that you send to us twice a week at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com so let's
get out the old gun and I'll just shine up the gun and point it to Jamie's head
all right let's read some emails or I'm gonna pull the trigger hey Rob what
STFU MF I'll shoot the kiddies I will shoot the
Caturday oh no okay we got two whole emails thank you people because I can't
really read very well right now I am heading to Anaheim California from
August 37 for Blizzcon okay everybody look for this guy are you guys going and
if you are want to grab some food and a restaurant I want to grab a restaurant
too and most likely other people from World of Warcraft radio I guess I hope
you guys don't think okay never mind this guy's just inviting us to lunch
who's that from speedy f40 speedy yeah I know he's plugged the Wow radio thing
before you know I'm not gonna if you weren't there um the last weekend of
this month then you can go to Disneyland with me if you pay how does that work I
am NOT going to Blizzcon none of us are going to Blizzcon but you know what you
know who is going to Blizzcon blizzard yes blizzard is going to Blizzcon so say
hi to them no so actually olr will have some representation at Blizzcon you're
gonna love this this is hilarious extra fur is going to Blizzcon he got he got a
ticket to Blizzcon for his birthday from his sister and her fiance who both also
play Wow in our guild so look for extra fur I actually want to send him with the
tape recorder a microphone to do some interviews at Blizzcon because I think
it would be hilarious sure so that's gonna be your olr representation at
Blizzcon right there but unfortunately because of the move and everything it's
it's too close to the finances for me probably doesn't help also that all the
tickets sold out within like a few hours that didn't help either and I was out of
town when they went on sale otherwise I might have bought one oh well so they
had interesting to see me go to Blizzcon because I have no interest in World of
Warcraft drunami says if we hang out with Wow radio we should say hi to total
biscuit I don't know who that is but I'm sure somebody listening does so there
total biscuit can I read the next you may okay hey olr crew it's me necky sorry I
haven't emailed in a while but I've been really busy been loving the show
recently by the way warning this might be really long no I've got longer sorry
you don't quite meet the the longest email category I've seen longer I've seen
plenty longer I've seen thicker can I read please yes you perverted people
what I was talking about emails shut up boo-hoo my 360 died earlier this week
and although it's a pain in the ass Microsoft is very good at cleaning this
up I had to I had to phone twice second because I forgot my original mobile no
but I was only on hold for a best ten minutes each call so things should go to
Microsoft for their good support the extended warranty shows that they are
taking responsibility for it so I am understanding however dot dot dot dot
dot dot the expected time I will get my Burke 360 back is over one month also
did Microsoft say they have fixed the problem with the new Xbox 360s if so I
intended to shell out for a new 360 instead the good point to my 360 dying
is that I finally have dug out my old ps2 some of the games seem unusually
unusual now and look bad graphics another thing is that the PlayStation
controller seemed tiny if using the Xbox 360 controllers alone for five to six
months dude you want to see tiny try playing with a dual analog controller
for the Saturn and everything will look tiny to you trust me also a note on an
email last week I fully support younger online players who are online I am now
15 I can truthfully say that I am definitely more mature than than other
even 30 year old players who use the n-word and anyway I'm not going to let
this go on really long so by necky PS this is good
gramming speller lol's I'm not well I could point them out but I'm not going
to because I'm not I'm too doped up to be a bitch tonight and PBS look for me
in the chat room I saw you there I was gonna say something hi necky you're so
lying you didn't look I did no I even voiced him all right and necky is one of
our listeners from the UK so to be in our chat room right now dude your
parents know you're up oh there was a question there but the Xbox 360 and and
having three well have they fixed the problem on Xbox 360 I believe they have
didn't they change the chips that were on in the Xbox 360 as part of to change
that problem Loki am I wrong they didn't change chips they changed the heatsinks
that were on the graphics chips and stuff and all the new ones um have been
are being fixed I guess so then the new system shouldn't have this problem
theoretically unless there's something else that goes wrong all right well
we'll see what happens so that's it for email yes right right email the Rob D
and chat confirms they changed the heatsinks so heat distribution is
different there you go I have an email you have an email yeah I got it right
here okay it says dear orange lounge radio
what's up I'm going to comic-con it's gonna be awesome well I thought maybe if
you need me to do something down there for you guys I could because I'm not

Galatav should get the comic-con only penny arcade poster for OLR yeah I want
to do that what work on that what good penny arcade I hate them why they're
really big jerks in real life when I was in line with that with one of the guys
I'm buying a hamburger at e3 two years ago what yeah I've never had a bag so
what did you what happened with you um I was in the one-up little party thing
they had one year yeah that in itself is bad but they're just like all arrogant
and cocky and not like the adorable kind like me but like the why are you sure
no lie are you sure you're not getting that mixed up with mega 64 no I know
those guys I thought were dick I know what penny arcade people look like okay
so I mean maybe I just caught them at a bad time I didn't really talk to them my
friend was talking to them but they were just arrogant and I didn't like like
when I met those guys from a mega 64 I didn't know who they were and they were
