487	19087	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19781	24403	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, July the 1st of 2007.
25063	36187	If you haven't heard Part A of our program yet, go back to wherever you got this episode, whether it be iTunes or Dig or wherever you got this, and look for Part A, because Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two parts every week.
36247	38948	It's the little announce in the beginning of the show told you.
39028	40248	So why am I repeating myself?
40648	41129	I don't know.
41209	42309	So let's get back to the gaming news.
43324	54111	There's an interesting little blog post I've seen pop up on Engadget showing someone that's modded a Wii Remote with a Zapper Gun from the Nintendo Entertainment System.
54911	65337	Now what they've done with this, and you might be wondering why the hell would they do this, is they've actually kind of repositioned the IR sensor that's in the front of the Wii Remote to the front of the Zapper Gun.
65537	69980	And of course the trigger on the Zapper Gun is now the B button for the Wii Remote.
70561	72203	Duck Hunt on Virtual Console already?
88665	90086	So we can really get some use out of this.
91326	96168	I think Dokkan's going to be a little harder because a lot of those gun games now, it's not going to be a straight port over.
96188	98629	They've got to rebuild the whole thing for the Wii Remote.
98829	100569	Oh, I guess that's kind of true, huh?
100609	109413	Well, can't, I mean, because basically these games run off of emulators anyway, so can't the Wii Remote kind of emulate a light gun in the same way that some Nintendo emulators let you use your mouse?
110153	115855	I suppose, but, you know, obviously the people that make the emulators aren't exactly the people that work for Nintendo either.
116075	117035	I would like me some Battle Clash.
141696	142976	and some SuperScope 6 stuff.
142996	143737	Good times.
144277	144577	All right.
145177	148538	The Doctor in chat says, I want some awesome 3D duck hunt.
149319	150479	That could be kind of interesting.
151659	155021	Shadow Charlie says, but isn't there supposed to be a Zapper adapter coming soon?
155141	158842	There is something that's officially going to come out at some point pretty soon.
158942	165204	I would imagine that, you know, because they were showing stuff at E3 last year that looked like a shotgun kind of attachment.
165304	167345	Obviously, that was, you know, more of a prototype.
168125	169206	You know, we might see something in E3.
169226	169346	I mean...
171022	172784	That's when they drop bombs like that.
173124	174465	Hey, this is going to be coming out soon.
194577	195118	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
214523	215444	Just like Castlevania.
231038	231799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
249215	254501	But certainly this is like a really high, you know, very highly anticipated A-list title, so to speak.
254641	254861	Oh, yeah.
254881	255662	So that's pretty cool.
256323	260007	But not the first time that Konami has gone to the Internet to find musicians.
260287	267596	Of course, if you follow the DDR series, the Ultramix and Universe series have previously had a competition to put indie artists in the game.
267996	268196	Yes.
270217	292235	Other thing that people might be looking for, I mean, granted the classic controller is pretty good for fighting games, but, you know, when you're looking for something just a little bit better and a little bit more like the arcade, well, you might be turning to a company like Hori, and they're actually going to be releasing a fighting stick for the Wii, which I imagine would be kind of hooking up to the Wii Remote, very similar to, like, the classic controller.
292735	296939	But, I mean, this is everything that you could possibly want in an arcade stick, and
297662	298303	It looks awesome.
298543	305028	Perfect for Street Fighter 2 Turbo or, of course, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core.
305048	308731	I was going to say all those original Wii fighting games that the Wii doesn't have right now.
308851	310093	I mean, they'll have Guilty Gear soon.
310253	313315	Well, virtual console stuff, and this will also be good for arcade games and stuff.
313636	314176	Hey, you know what?
315097	317199	Not a lot of people really pick up these arcade sticks.
317379	319541	It's the people that really are into their hardcore.
319561	320321	Fucking hardcore.
320501	322263	You know, games like that, so...
323069	327191	Can I use it backwards compatible with GameCube, like for Soul Calibur action?
328091	340697	Probably not, because this is going to be hooking up via the expansion port on the Wii Remote, so since you can't use the Wii Remote or Classic Controller on GameCube games, you're out of luck.
340837	345800	And you probably wouldn't be able to anyways, because there's really only one directional button...
346877	353542	Directional Joystick on there and eight buttons, so you wouldn't have all the analog sticks and stuff that the GameCube would have.
355584	355844	Oh well.
358786	361608	Sorry, I was just responding to some comments in chat there.
361648	366552	Somebody who just joined, who hasn't changed their nickname yet, says, why can't the PSP get Contra 4?
366632	368093	Why didn't Contra 4 go to the PSP?
368573	370875	And Ranma responded, because the PSP sucks ass.
371135	372777	And I was like, play FF1.
374574	381481	It doesn't suck ass, but I think that this game would work pretty good on the DS.
381581	392212	After all, the first three Contra games were on the Nintendo system, so only fitting that Contra 4 come to the DS.
393683	394484	Thanks for watching!
410233	410874	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
431632	441261	Radio Esther Nolan's show, and actually said here, "...I thought it was absolutely appalling that a word like this should be used to describe someone who has not achieved very well."
450850	458214	The three-year-old, by the way, to put this in perspective, her three-year-old suffered from cerebral palsy and was also severely brain damaged.
458574	460935	So she was kind of... That's not funny!
461595	463316	I'm just thinking of what the word was.
463616	465017	Not the situation.
465057	466577	That's really sad.
467498	476242	And the lady was very shocked because she performed poorly in this one stage and the game called her, quote, it rated her efforts in a manner derogatory to the disabled.
476962	478503	So I'm thinking the word is retarded?
480058	482339	I guess, which, you know, is a word.
482400	484721	I'll admit, we do it here on the program.
484801	488923	A lot of, you know, we throw that word around sometimes and not really think about what it really means.
488943	500850	But, you know, you have to understand that we, I mean, the word retard means to slow or, you know, to, I guess, I don't know, basically slow, you know, retarding something.
501230	504252	You know, retard your anger, you know.
504912	506253	That was in anger management.
506273	506353	Yeah.
508715	511858	I'm going to tell the Loki next time the subject of Apple comes up.
512178	513399	Retard your anger.
514200	516782	No, but seriously, that's how you... In music, you use that term.
517042	518263	That's how you use the word.
518523	519064	It's unfortunate.
519084	520585	It's just like, you know, what is it?
520725	521125	Fag.
521145	532234	You know, people... It isn't, you know, to describe a cigarette and stuff, but it's, you know, slang in the UK, but over here, you know, we use it as, you know, what I get called.
532574	533896	Yes, exactly.
533956	535457	Fag your anger, Rob.
537458	538739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
566536	569299	I think mine was by Ubisoft, so shame on them.
569579	570860	What do you think, Rice Princess?
571501	572482	Do you have an opinion on this?
573402	577206	Because you haven't really been talking the rest of the show otherwise, so I'm trying to encourage you to participate.
577226	579488	Yeah, I'm totally looking at my life journal.
582076	582396	I don't know.
582436	584117	It really depends on what the word actually is.
584157	586479	I just think that they should have included that in the article.
587099	592623	Otherwise, it could be something like, you know, I don't know, farty butt or something, you know, being the actual word.
592763	593763	I've never heard of farty butt.
593783	594744	You're so dumb.
596025	600207	I've never heard of farty butt be used for a derogatory term that is disabled.
600688	605531	I personally think it's the word Cali from Battlestar Galactica.
606069	609051	Dark Knight says it's the French Ubisoft
635871	638612	GirlBakura says, something with the word spastic.
638992	642734	Maybe like a spaz, or I don't know, maybe could be the word there.
643355	643895	Let's see.
646016	648518	Azurame says, I think she is right.
648638	652260	I work in the mental field, and they could get in some serious trouble if told to the right people.
652720	656662	Ranma also says, whatever happens, sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.
657603	658043	Interesting.
659044	659584	So there you go.
659604	661245	Sigh.
662498	665379	and ACHP says the word was spastic.
667159	670320	Is spastic really that bad?
672120	673780	Have I just been ignorant all these years?
673840	674160	Ignant?
674861	675681	Why are you so ignorant?
675941	676421	I don't know.
678181	680862	Spastic I don't think is a bad term.
681422	681882	I don't know.
682802	683762	That's stupid.
684262	685403	She's spastic.
685783	686643	Fucking spaz.
687489	696653	This frustration leaves me with no other choice but to bring on one of our very favorite segments because I'm just left confused and unsure with what else to do at this point.
707738	709318	It's the F-U's of the week time.
709618	714700	And just before we get started, AZHP says that spastic is a bad word in the UK but not in America.
714881	715841	Kind of like how fag...
716243	716964	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
735186	737548	It was nice to see that they've repaved the freeway.
738128	741591	The only problem is they forgot to paint lines on the freeway.
741991	747575	So there's this four-lane highway that all of a sudden becomes one lane because there's no lines on it!
748977	750257	Makes it a little unsafe.
751258	752459	Just a little, you know.
752639	757583	Especially when cars are like, well, I don't know where the lane ends, so... That's kind of bad.
758103	760065	Kind of something you should have, I don't know...
760908	763190	Done before you finish your project here.
763250	766212	At least put something that indicates where the lane ends and begins.
767173	770976	So, fuck them, because I know someone's going to get injured and hopefully sue for a lot of money.
772737	773137	My F.U.
773197	782124	of the week goes to the fact that I just put in my notice I'm going to move on August 1st today, and I have no place to live lined up just yet, so I'll be hitting Craigslist all next week.
782925	787048	Or it might be OLR, Live From Your House, a contest from the listeners, because I'll be homeless.
787528	788028	Wow.
788609	789149	Pretty fat.
789169	789529	Yeah.
789770	790190	Rice for toast.
791656	794217	F you to the weather because it's way too fucking hot.
794838	796678	And I don't have an air conditioner in my car.
796758	797939	Because I'm Poe.
799660	801321	And I can't afford a luxury car.
802821	803902	And that's pretty much it.
804762	805323	I'm sorry too.
807844	809384	Anyhow, what are you giggling at over there, Loki?
809845	810905	Shadows liar.
812286	813586	Fag your anger, Loki.
817756	822120	If anybody hasn't left a review on iTunes... Oh, damn it, they're going to block that word.
822140	824262	You're not going to be able to put fag in a review on iTunes.
825142	827064	Damn, because I was going to say... Oh, that's retarded.
829986	830487	That's horrible.
830527	833509	I apologize if you were offended by that and the fact that I laughed at it.
833989	836912	Oh, whatever, that's your automatic gut reaction.
837072	839694	You don't have to apologize for who you are, Rob.
839714	845238	But I really want to see a review on iTunes that says, these guys need to learn how to fag their anger.
847051	847792	That'd be brilliant.
847812	848752	Can someone make that happen?
849112	851054	Get around the word censor somehow.
851114	853215	Put P-H-A-G or something.
853655	859179	I'll give you the link in iTunes if you want to go leave a review there for our chatters, because I'm sure there's someone in there that hasn't done it.
859479	860160	Good idea.
860780	861941	Yeah, there you go.
862041	865803	And Sickester, Insanist, in the chat says, F-H-A-G, Fag Your Anger.
865823	869346	I really want someone in the chat to leave that as an iTunes review.
869386	871047	These guys need to learn how to fag their anger.
871067	873849	Oh, good times.
873869	874509	So anyways...
876761	877402	So, guess what?
877602	885046	There's this brand new, well, it's not brand new, but a racing series coming back to consoles exclusively to the Wii.
885206	898414	It's called Cruisin', and it's going to be exclusively coming to the Wii with licensed cars and whatnot, body kits, upgrades, turbos, all that fun stuff.
899335	902917	So, Cruisin', coming to the Wii.
903672	907053	You know, to be honest, I never was a huge fan of the Cruisin' series.
908574	911654	I always thought them to be kind of cheesy and stupid.
912835	916396	I seem to remember DarkSakura as a big fan, though, so she'll probably be excited about this.
917656	918276	I played the games.
918297	918937	They were pretty fun.
918977	920137	Did anyone remember Rush?
920737	921738	Yeah.
922078	923198	Rush 2049, San Francisco Rush?
923338	929920	No, I meant the last Rush game that they released that was basically... I don't remember if it was Rush.
930000	932241	I think it was just San Francisco Rush, but they redid it.
933937	935078	for the PSP and stuff.
935698	936439	It wasn't very good.
937859	938259	Interesting.
938600	940821	So you think this game might be a disaster as well?
941861	942581	I think it might be.
942721	946443	Just what we needed in this next gen of gaming or new gen of gaming, whatever you want to call it.
946863	948224	Another fucking racing game.
948404	948684	That sucks.
948704	952186	Even if it is a memorable one from the years past.
953527	954307	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
977344	979386	which was a TurboGrafx game there.
979606	980347	Bloody Wolf?
980707	982949	No, it's like a war-ish game there on the TurboGrafx-16.
982989	986092	So you get cutesy cutesy Kirby and Bloody Wolf.
986652	987113	There you go.
987793	988954	Kirby's Bloody Wolf.
990255	991156	What came out in America?
991216	991997	I totally missed it.
992317	993518	We got the F-Zero, didn't we?
993859	994379	I think so.
994439	994839	I don't know.
994859	998603	I haven't downloaded anything from Virtual Console since Zelda 2.
998663	999824	Wasn't that just two weeks ago?
999844	1000564	It wasn't that long ago.
1001365	1002826	It seems like a long time ago.
1002947	1003367	There you go.
1004169	1006130	Well, some other stuff you're going to be able to download soon.
1006290	1011613	And I don't know why this is a news story, because I always thought this was still on there in the first place.
1011693	1018857	But also a reminder, if you haven't downloaded the internet channel yet, you're now going to have to pay for it.
1018997	1020818	So screw you guys.
1020898	1021738	Not that it's any good.
1022298	1027221	Not that we don't have an OLOB site, because I never made one.
1027581	1028301	Because you're lazy.
1028401	1029362	Because I'm lazy.
1030067	1034912	But anyways, there's going to be a brand new service coming to have original downloadable tiles called WiiWare.
1035332	1043720	And if I remember correctly, that's already online with, I think, the internet channel and also the Wii Vote channel.
1044080	1044881	It's called WiiWare.
1045141	1047604	And hypothetically, there's Dr. Mario Wii, right?
1048204	1049085	Well, hypothetically.
1049105	1049926	2 plus 2 equals 4.
1050406	1055050	This, I'm not sure if it's going to be a brand new channel, but currently online right now, they do have a section for WiiWare.
1055090	1055631	It's been there.
1056158	1065422	Forever, but they just want you to remember that there is going to be a WiiWare service that's going to be kind of like Xbox Live Arcade or the PlayStation 3 PSN Network.
1065542	1067523	So, I don't know.
1067763	1075726	Going to be seeing some original titles, which will be cool, and I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to find out what exactly is coming there first.
1076406	1078967	Obviously, we're thinking Dr. Mario Wii.
1080148	1082349	I haven't checked the Everybody Votes channel in weeks.
1082409	1084270	Did they ever use the question I submitted to them?
1084970	1085250	I don't know.
1085858	1087719	Last one I saw was thank you or hello.
1088599	1091960	No, the question I submitted was which is funnier, clowns or rape?
1092440	1093600	I don't know if they use that, though.
1094701	1097522	I'm thinking they probably didn't because I probably would have heard something about it.
1097982	1099482	It probably would have made the gaming blog news.
1103424	1110446	Also making the gaming blog news this week is the launch of Three Speech because everybody and their fucking mom has to have a podcast.
1110886	1112506	And so Sony started one.
1112526	1114427	They have the Three Speech podcast.
1115314	1117535	And what did they do in their first podcast?
1117796	1122438	It might not have been the first episode, but definitely they're still early on in their podcasting life.
1122778	1124259	They've taken a shot at Major Nelson.
1126521	1137127	What's interesting, though, is that upon reviews of the new Three Speech podcast, Three Speech doesn't really let you know that they work for Sony, where Major Nelson kind of makes it no secret he does work for Microsoft.
1137387	1142670	But the interesting thing about Major Nelson, he'll say nice things about the Wii once in a while, and even PlayStation 3 if they deserve it.
1143430	1144411	So there you go.
1145477	1149599	and, sorry, I laughed because I'm reading chat here.
1149720	1153942	WonderDogHerald suggests everybody votes question, which do you prefer, cock or vag?
1156483	1157584	Yeah, I'm sure that'll get through.
1158924	1159965	They're dinner meats.
1161025	1161386	Anyhow.
1162886	1163907	What the hell?
1164847	1165708	Oh, they're dinner meats.
1167093	1168733	Great way to cover that up there.
1169013	1169454	You know what?
1169514	1170474	Forget the other story.
1170694	1173875	It's just a story about Sony making fun of Major Nelson.
1173915	1174335	Who cares?
1174495	1175175	Yeah, who cares?
1175555	1176695	Boo-hoo.
1176775	1179096	I'm seriously reading this going, who cares?
1180296	1180836	Boo-hoo.
1181697	1184517	They refer to Major Nelson as the unnamed blogger.
1184617	1185798	Oh my god!
1186178	1186598	No!
1186718	1188198	Why do they say he's unnamed?
1188238	1189919	He clearly has a name!
1190339	1191679	Major Nelson!
1192299	1195380	That is just pure falsity.
1195400	1195480	Yeah.
1196161	1199283	That's right, I made up a word, falsity.
1200804	1201485	I don't really care.
1201565	1206889	I've listened to Major Nelson once, not that I have anything against the guy, I just don't have time to listen to him.
1207329	1211392	And the three-speech podcast I'll probably never listen to, so you know what?
1211552	1213434	Listen to this podcast, it's all you need.
1213754	1220199	Major spoiler alert here, but I hear that the next three-speech podcast calls Leo Laporte spastic.
1223254	1226916	And then the next one, they tell Reggie if he's made of faggot's anger.
1229017	1229838	Anyways.
1230938	1233880	So, this is kind of interesting, actually.
1233920	1239483	We've been seeing a lot of these weird third-party adapters and stuff come out for the 360.
1240444	1246027	This one, though, is being created by XMN, and that's a mod company.
1246847	1251310	And they're actually creating an HDMI cable for the regular non-elite
1253373	1279035	and no word yet on how exactly it's going to work but apparently it's going to allow you to use HDMI cables obviously for 1080p on systems that may not be black and supporting a HDMI out on it so the speculation I believe is that it's going to be something that has to do with the VGA cable maybe converting the signal over to work on HDMI I don't know
1279611	1281852	But it should be interesting to see.
1281972	1287615	So if you want to keep an eye on that, check out xcm.cc.
1288456	1290577	And they have all the information on that.
1293058	1293398	All right.
1293938	1296920	Now, why would I want to get an HDMI cable?
1296960	1298260	Is it really that big a difference?
1298741	1299821	I don't think it's a big difference.
1299881	1305944	It's really, you know, if you want that kind of cable for your console.
1305964	1308666	I think they're maybe worried that later on when...
1310000	1311262	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1325093	1331778	Also on the Xbox 360, something you can see in this lovely new HDMI would be some of the new achievements in the NCAA Football 08.
1333460	1340525	Now, there's an achievement list, and what's kind of interesting about it is that there's actually some product placement in the achievement list.
1340565	1344848	They even use, for the little icons for the achievement, like Pontiac and Old Spice.
1344928	1346910	There are actual official logos there.
1347790	1350572	I'm trying to look at what some of these are actually called, some of these achievements.
1351133	1353134	You can get the list for yourself at Xbox360Achievements.org.
1355458	1355859	Let's see.
1356139	1356659	There it is, yeah.
1356999	1358760	Old Spice Red Zone Perfection.
1358840	1362162	Complete a Play Now or Dynasty Mode game with Red Zone efficiency rating of 100%.
1362202	1364203	You get 15 gamer points for that.
1364503	1367084	Pontiac Fourth Quarter Comeback, with a little Pontiac logo.
1367344	1371386	Win a Play Now or Dynasty Mode game when down by 14 to start the fourth quarter.
1371706	1380070	You know, I don't understand, but yet still with all these corporate sponsorships, and now they're going to throw their logos into my achievements list, these games are still $60!
1381935	1382976	Thanks for watching.
1382996	1383656	See you next time.
1406480	1406800	I don't know.
1407040	1410163	And Solid Goomba in chat says, remember the Fight Night achievements?
1410223	1411964	Like there was like a Burger King match and all that stuff.
1412244	1415186	But the interesting thing about that, I mean, yeah, it hasn't happened in a while though.
1415206	1419349	And the interesting thing about this is that these achievements like actually have the company's logos in them.
1419649	1425172	And remember that these things will show up on like your gamer thing in the Xbox and when you look on the internet and all that crap.
1425613	1427074	So it's just kind of interesting.
1427434	1430756	It's going to filthy up your profile with corporate logos.
1430916	1433458	Well, not a problem for me because I hate sports games, but...
1434127	1434988	I'm going to tell you this much.
1435428	1436389	But you love achievements.
1436749	1442153	I do like achievements, but I'm not going to buy a product because I see a fucking logo for it.
1442233	1449358	If it were that easy, then, you know, these people would be making billions upon billions of dollars just for having their logo out there.
1449398	1451360	It's just you don't automatically go.
1451500	1453381	Well, they obviously pay for this because it works.
1453441	1454662	I mean, it's like product recognition.
1454702	1455323	Like, I don't know.
1455383	1460867	Maybe somebody sees the little Old Spice logo and goes, oh, yeah, I need to pick up, you know, some deodorant.
1460907	1462088	I'll get, you know, get that.
1462108	1463129	And then that's like in their mind.
1463169	1463489	I don't know.
1464377	1464778	I don't know.
1466221	1467124	But, whatever.
1468735	1469335	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1499091	1500293	I knew you would like this news.
1502095	1502716	I love the game.
1502977	1506201	You can pick up a cow with your tractor beam and then hug it.
1506281	1507403	I notice there's a theme here.
1507443	1510166	You like these games where you get to play as aliens and do things to humans.
1510887	1511508	Not necessarily.
1511548	1512630	I like Grand Theft Auto.
1513010	1514132	I like sandbox games.
1515230	1515771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1538638	1544900	Alright, well, another very popular series that a lot of people like is Geometry Wars Galaxies.
1544960	1550342	Well, I'm sorry, Geometry Wars, but people are looking forward to Geometry War Galaxies because they like the old school one.
1550762	1552403	And GameSpot put up a video this week.
1552483	1555884	It was a demo of the upcoming Wii title, Geometry Wars Galaxies.
1556304	1559585	But what kind of caused some people to turn around and go, huh?
1560125	1565907	Is that during the demo, the developer actually pauses the game and the word achievements comes up.
1566653	1572560	So the question comes up, is this game actually secretly being developed for Xbox 360 as well?
1573581	1575704	Or are there achievements coming to the Wii?
1576585	1580910	Or is it because the game is early in development and it's a port and they just haven't gotten rid of that yet?
1580950	1584133	I mean, there's a million different theories, but it certainly has made some people go, huh?
1585942	1592188	I think it's just probably, you know, not necessarily... It doesn't have to have the achievement system from 360 in order to have achievements.
1592228	1593289	I mean, look at Resistance.
1593349	1596792	Resistance has achievements in it, but it's just for the game.
1596912	1598793	It's not anything... Like internal achievements.
1598813	1599294	Exactly.
1599474	1601756	It's just for unlocking bonus content and stuff like that.
1601836	1606120	It's not necessarily... EA has that even on the 360, like the Burnout games.
1606220	1608642	You get those stupid trophies for, like, everything you do.
1608982	1609423	Yeah, exactly.
1609463	1610704	You hit the gas pedal.
1610744	1611425	You get a trophy.
1611445	1612586	Exactly.
1612606	1612966	Exactly.
1613662	1622888	Another interesting thing, though, coming from Geometry Wars Galaxies is they're going to have download play in there as well.
1622988	1632835	So if you own the DS version of the game, you can actually transfer over and download play a full version of Geometry Wars Retro Evolved onto other stuff.
1633015	1639919	Also, if you have the Wii version, you can transfer over a full version of Geometry Wars Retro Evolved onto the DS.
1640019	1642321	So it's going to have cross-platform play that way.
1644195	1644639	It's Connie.
1644740	1644942	Huh.
1645484	1646485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1675583	1677706	The Animal Crossing Island is the thing I always think of.
1677726	1679828	Remember in Animal Crossing you could go to the island on the Game Boy?
1680289	1680789	It was awesome.
1681610	1681910	Awesome.
1683833	1690540	Now another thing that's super awesome, and it's because it's Grand Theft Auto 4, the brand new trailer came out.
1690821	1691481	It looks pretty cool.
1691722	1695326	They didn't show a whole lot in there, but definitely...
1697587	1700129	The graphics looked a little bit scaled down from what they were before.
1701390	1706273	Obviously, though, they're probably tweaking it to make sure that the frame rate is good.
1706453	1712978	But they did show some gunfights and, of course, car chases and all that fun stuff.
1713438	1717642	It's just more of a tease right now, and I'm sure there's going to be a new trailer coming out about once a month or so.
1718362	1722885	Especially with E3 right around the corner, you know there's going to be something that they're going to be teasing at least.
1724006	1724907	Only a few months away now.
1726656	1729919	All right, so are you still very excited about this?
1729999	1733982	I mean, was there any kind of revelations that the trailer had for you, or is it just more like mouth-wetting?
1734442	1735723	It was just mouth-wetting.
1735743	1749434	They did show the main character, Nico, actually holding on to the back of a truck, kind of being held on to that, and then also hanging from a helicopter, which looked pretty cool.
1749875	1751796	So, I don't know.
1751996	1753417	It looks awesome.
1753438	1755199	I think once we see this game in action...
1755987	1756989	It's just going to be phenomenal.
1757210	1763805	And I have the collector's edition on order, because I have to have all that crap that comes with it.
1766778	1767178	All right.
1767538	1774920	Well, we're going to get into another segment here, and we're going to go from something very, very new to a classic segment on Orange Lounge Radio.
1774940	1779681	It's a game we like to play, especially during slow news weeks such as this one, called Beat the Host.
1780281	1784442	And tonight on Beat the Host, we're going to be looking for a contestant to call us on our Skype line.
1784842	1786342	Go ahead and call now if you'd like to play.
1786702	1791783	However, for tonight's Beat the Host, you should know retro knowledge is really going to help tonight.
1792208	1799452	So 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to play, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
1799552	1804915	So go ahead and give us a call right now, and we will take the first person to call in on our Skype line.
1805475	1817401	And the way it's going to work, we're going to change up the rules again a little bit tonight, but it is going to have to do with identifying game music or game noise, and I will let you know a little more about that when we get into the game.
1817802	1819342	All right, we're starting to get some calls on the line.
1819422	1820343	Let's go to a call.
1821030	1822091	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1822112	1822512	Who's this?
1823213	1824014	Hey, it's Ranma.
1824895	1826317	Hi, Ranma.
1827138	1828680	Finally, a normal sounding call.
1830022	1830963	We have our contestant.
1831283	1832245	Stop calling everybody.
1832285	1833126	Stop calling everybody.
1833586	1836390	You guys can call later when we open up the Skype line for calls.
1837291	1839374	Ranma, you ready to play some Beat the Host?
1839946	1840246	Yeah!
1840486	1843088	Alright, tonight, you get to challenge Loki.
1843808	1850172	He's the only one, because I already know the questions, and well, Irene, you would just whoop her ass, I mean, no matter what the game is.
1850192	1851092	Wait, what is the topic?
1851132	1852153	The topic is Atari 2600 games.
1852173	1852733	Oh yeah, pick that.
1855600	1861742	Alright, so Matt, in part A, you may remember, seemed to be, he flaunted his Atari 2600 knowledge.
1861802	1865684	I just like playing Atari 2600, it doesn't mean I've played everything.
1865884	1866524	I like combat.
1866784	1867705	This is going to be tough tonight.
1867725	1870646	Because it's so tough, we're going to change up the rules of Beat the Host a little bit tonight.
1870666	1872687	Because you know every time we play Beat the Host, we change the rules.
1872747	1873207	Okay, Ranma?
1874287	1874427	Yeah.
1874647	1879169	Okay, so what we're going to do, I'm going to need you to speak nice and loud, or I might not hear you over the game music, okay?
1879189	1881470	Alright, hold on, let me, I'm going to leave the chat room.
1881840	1883301	All right, yes, you need to leave the chat room.
1883321	1883781	That's good.
1883821	1884841	That's very ethical of you.
1884881	1885561	I appreciate that.
1886262	1886542	All right.
1886922	1892124	Now, what's going to happen is that we're going to play some music from Atari 2600 games.
1892824	1897346	I actually recorded myself playing some Atari 2600 games earlier today, and you're going to hear some music from them.
1897706	1901708	The first one of you guys to shout out the correct answer gets a point.
1902188	1903129	Game number one
1939714	1949739	It's based on a vector arcade game, but the Atari 2600 couldn't support vector graphics.
1950399	1952560	No.
1952680	1957983	Since there was no separate hyperspace button, you used this by pulling the joystick down.
1960339	1961400	Galaxin?
1961660	1962300	Can I answer?
1962641	1962781	No.
1964602	1967964	When you shoot a rock, it splits into two smaller rocks.
1968044	1968425	Asteroids.
1968605	1969025	Asteroids.
1969345	1970446	Ah, Loki got it first.
1970526	1971407	Loki gets a point.
1971447	1972327	Good job, Loki.
1973068	1973448	Good job.
1973508	1973968	Yay.
1974088	1974449	All right.
1975429	1976350	One point for Loki.
1976370	1977191	That was Asteroids.
1977211	1979412	I just didn't remember the er, er, er, er part.
1979432	1979752	All right.
1980693	1981533	All right, here we go.
1981734	1983175	Let's go to, you ready for number two, Rama?
1983755	1983855	Yeah.
1983875	1986497	If you can get it like three seconds sooner next time, you'll be good.
1987117	1987578	No problem.
1987618	1989419	All right, here's song, or game number two.
1994585	1994965	Combat.
1995645	1998746	Oh, Loki got it without even a hint.
2000507	2004889	I knew he'd get it when he said he'd played all those Combat back in the day.
2005149	2007029	You're not looking at my computer screen, right?
2007409	2009030	I can't see anything on your computer screen.
2009730	2010430	That was Combat.
2010470	2010951	Good job.
2011511	2014092	That was the default packing game for the Atari 2600, by the way.
2014812	2015292	Alright, here we go.
2015312	2017013	You ready for number three, Ranma?
2017473	2017953	You can do it.
2017993	2018233	Come on.
2018493	2019514	You're losing 2-0.
2019754	2020594	Let's see what we can do.
2027509	2027709	No.
2030611	2031031	Tempest.
2031772	2031992	Nope.
2038436	2040697	There's a version of this on Xbox Live.
2043019	2043479	Centipede.
2044039	2044440	Millipede.
2050323	2052705	Pressing the button flapped your wings.
2053365	2053425	No.
2053445	2053645	Joust.
2057460	2058501	Oh, you got it.
2058561	2059001	Good job.
2059041	2060002	It was joust.
2061163	2062023	Nice job.
2062083	2062864	It was joust.
2063324	2064285	All right.
2064305	2064825	3-0, Ranma.
2065305	2066166	You're killing me here.
2067106	2067887	Sorry, dude.
2068307	2068787	It's all right.
2068807	2069528	I still love you, man.
2070248	2070508	All right.
2071029	2071429	Here we go.
2071789	2072950	Now, this one is a tricky one.
2073010	2073890	I'm going to tell you straight up.
2073910	2075231	This one is fucking hard, all right?
2075291	2075812	So here we go.
2075872	2078153	If either of you get this, I will be very impressed.
2079194	2079514	Boom.
2080635	2081335	Boom.
2081955	2082236	Boom.
2082516	2083556	Boom.
2092032	2094473	Evil Otto was a character that would chase you.
2095734	2096314	Robotron?
2097075	2097315	No.
2103879	2108741	Some people know this game from the big happy face bouncing creature that would stalk you.
2109021	2109802	That's Evil Otto.
2110622	2111043	Frenzy.
2111763	2111923	No.
2112804	2115905	Damn.
2116626	2118507	You shot robots in a maze.
2119307	2120148	Robotron 23?
2120588	2120708	No.
2126850	2127470	Ten seconds.
2128050	2131371	Evil Otto, Big Happy Face, Bouncing Creature, Robots in a Maze.
2133011	2133451	Galaxian?
2133551	2133711	Oh.
2133851	2134531	I don't know.
2135472	2136472	Berserk.
2137772	2139833	Berserk is the game.
2140453	2140853	Berserk.
2140873	2142573	I actually had the board game to that.
2142873	2143313	You what?
2143954	2145594	I actually had the board game to that, like,
2146388	2147508	Well, very long time ago.
2148028	2149029	Ah, good job.
2149069	2150829	You know, and, oh well, it happens.
2150989	2151489	Brain fart.
2151509	2153269	Frenzies just like that game, too.
2153369	2155250	Good job in the chat room, though.
2155330	2156470	Some folks there got bizarre.
2156510	2160271	Some folks were saying it was Sword Quest, which was a really good guess, but unfortunately not right.
2160291	2164152	All right, this next one's a toughie, too, and I'll also be impressed if either of you get this.
2174975	2193374	In this game, you are out to rescue Lady P. Lady P is being held by a jungle tribe.
2193975	2194295	Oh, wow.
2203877	2210501	You start this game swinging from rope to rope, then you fight crocodiles, then you dodge falling rocks.
2211282	2212382	Can I please answer?
2212542	2212743	Nope.
2213403	2214584	This wasn't Kongo Bongo.
2215044	2215204	No.
2216125	2216885	Ranma, you still with us?
2217485	2220207	Yeah, I know what the game is, I just can't remember the title.
2222148	2223549	It's not Donkey Kong Jr., is it?
2223849	2224630	Ten seconds, no.
2229488	2234110	Lady P, Jungle Tribe, Swinging Ropes, Fighting Crocodiles, Dodging Falling Rocks.
2235650	2237251	You do all that in Jungle Hunt.
2238631	2239372	Jungle Hunt.
2239612	2241472	All right, still 3-0 in Loki's favor.
2241733	2242693	You can still win it, though.
2243373	2243673	Okay.
2243853	2245714	All right, I got an easier one for you this time.
2245754	2246254	All right, you ready?
2247155	2247315	Ready.
2247615	2247955	Here we go.
2250196	2250576	Pac-Man.
2251676	2253857	Oh, my God, that was fast.
2255358	2257658	He knew it right from the starting tone there.
2257699	2258879	It was Pac-Man.
2259585	2264008	Let's play a little more of that, because I barely got to hear any of it.
2264028	2265529	Remember little ghost chasing noises?
2266329	2269291	Yeah, there it is.
2269831	2274774	Based on a very popular arcade game, but it was considered a disappointment, the home version.
2275595	2277196	I have a poster for this at my work.
2277536	2279917	You eat a wafer for bonus points in Pac-Man.
2280818	2281538	Look at that.
2281778	2282159	Damn.
2282939	2283319	All right.
2284200	2284700	That's all right.
2284740	2287282	There's four left, so Ranma, you can still tie it up.
2288202	2288723	Working on it.
2289023	2289303	All right.
2290029	2290629	It's alright Ranma.
2291010	2291910	It was a long time ago.
2292391	2294252	I barely remember these when I was playing through them today.
2294612	2295773	Alright, now this one is fun.
2295813	2297935	This one's a tricky one, but I love this game.
2299295	2299956	Burger time.
2299976	2300056	No.
2313374	2314795	Oh, Ranma gets one!
2314875	2315956	It was Popeye.
2316016	2316837	It sounded familiar.
2317237	2317638	That's right.
2317778	2320360	Of course, you can kind of hear a little theme being used in the game.
2321981	2324043	There was a movie out around the same time.
2324323	2328006	And remember, this was a really cool game at the time because the stages were so unique.
2328026	2334932	And in that first stage that you were hearing, Olive Oil was actually throwing hearts down that you had to catch before they sank in the water.
2335232	2336553	Ranma is on the board!
2336633	2337314	Good job, Ranma.
2338123	2338563	Pitfall 2 Pitfall 2
2366347	2367307	Oh, poor Ranma.
2367347	2368008	It is Pitfall 2.
2368788	2371229	It was one of the first games to feature a full soundtrack.
2371869	2375930	The sequel to another popular Atari game and the main character was Pitfall, Harry.
2376450	2377590	Ranma, so close.
2378071	2378491	You know what?
2378631	2381292	Just because Loki pisses me off sometimes, I'm going to give that to you anyway.
2381312	2382152	We're going to give it to you.
2382172	2382332	Sweet.
2382772	2383152	All right.
2384733	2385433	All right, so there we go.
2385493	2386633	So what do we have?
2386673	2388074	Four for Loki, two for Ranma.
2388654	2389174	All right, here we go.
2390614	2391415	Let's go to another one.
2391435	2392415	This one is also very hard.
2392455	2392735	Here we go.
2402375	2402575	No.
2407356	2410257	This game was also based on a popular movie series.
2410777	2411437	Star Trek?
2411877	2412097	No.
2412577	2413177	Star Wars?
2413517	2413717	Nope.
2414497	2414897	E.T.?
2415378	2415618	Nope.
2420919	2424459	You can walk into a phone booth to change from one character to another.
2424479	2424519	No.
2424779	2426239	Superman?
2426920	2427820	Yes, Ranma got it.
2427840	2428540	It was Superman.
2429060	2429140	Ah...
2430140	2431321	Remember the Superman game?
2431361	2432121	It was great.
2432202	2436545	It was so weird because, like, you could fly up and you would fly into another screen.
2437405	2439026	Like, you moved up, down, left, and right.
2439146	2439887	Like, it was weird.
2439927	2440607	It was very weird.
2441108	2441528	There you go.
2441588	2442789	Ranma's got three now.
2443049	2444130	Well, because you gave him one.
2444150	2444570	Yeah, I did.
2444610	2445131	I totally gave him one.
2445671	2445991	All right.
2446231	2446752	That's all right.
2447672	2448933	Let's see if we can tie it up, Ranma.
2448953	2449894	This is the last one.
2450314	2450795	All right.
2450815	2451635	And this is a doozy.
2452496	2453356	This is a hell of a game.
2453396	2453777	Here we go.
2455758	2459141	Miss Pac-Man.
2459541	2459681	No.
2461778	2461958	No.
2466960	2469442	This game was made by Mystique Entertainment.
2471343	2471763	Adventure?
2472263	2472443	No.
2478247	2478467	No.
2480228	2483730	It's a highly controversial game that shows up on lots of gag Atari 2600 lists.
2485310	2486712	Custer's Revenge.
2486832	2487694	Good job, Loki.
2487754	2489316	It is Custer's Revenge.
2489777	2491359	And of course, the object of the game.
2491909	2496352	Your naked ass has to fuck an Indian girl lots and lots and that's why the game is very controversial.
2496393	2498234	You were just playing that earlier.
2498314	2500215	Yeah, that's when I was recording the clips.
2500416	2501617	Oh my god, that was so funny.
2501637	2503878	That's why you couldn't play because you walked in here when I was setting it up.
2504078	2504899	Oh yeah.
2505279	2516308	Alright, well the final score Ranma, you got three points a very good showing and unfortunately Loki beat you with five so unfortunately you got beat by the host tonight but you made a damn good effort on a very tough topic.
2516974	2517474	Thanks, man.
2517534	2518195	I appreciate it.
2518335	2519616	No problemo.
2519676	2524559	Take any shout-outs or plugs you want to give as long as we have you on the air as a consolation prize.
2525520	2529343	Visit my website, www.djranmas.net.
2529563	2530023	There you go.
2531705	2532105	All right.
2532325	2532685	Sounds good.
2532705	2533246	Thanks, Ranma.
2533266	2533606	Take care.
2533746	2534026	Got it.
2534347	2534747	Bye.
2535928	2536508	All right.
2536908	2545635	Now, the audio looked a little low to me on the board here, but it seems like the chat room was able to play along just fine, so I'm hoping the audio was just fine there as far as...
2546857	2548061	Live radio, boys and girls.
2548101	2548502	Take it or leave it.
2556339	2556639	HURRICAN
2579128	2585895	and you can download Hurricane from the site hurrican-game.de because it's German.
2586035	2587296	It's a 40 megabyte game.
2587436	2593222	It's Windows compatible and if you remember gaming on the Commodore 64, you're probably going to love this.
2593622	2595304	So check it out, Hurricane.
2596345	2603672	Another game that's getting a sequel and it's long due, I think, and this is, I guess, a rumor for right now, but Parasite Eve is...
2604884	2608186	Slated on possibly coming out to the PlayStation 3 and 360.
2610027	2616351	And no word exactly on any details on that, but I don't know.
2616932	2623136	I guess people were thinking, because they originally announced Parasite Eve 3 as a mobile game, but they're thinking this is going to be something else.
2624737	2633883	It says also, I guess Quarterman from EGM is saying that they're going to be, Hideo Kojima is going to be...
2634684	2634924	I was?
2635024	2635384	I was.
2660074	2661055	Maybe I'm smoking crack.
2661475	2662996	I thought it was a good game.
2663076	2666118	I never actually beat it, but I played through a good part of it.
2666198	2668299	That was me in most Final Fantasy games.
2668920	2670281	I like the combat system in that.
2670301	2675644	The combat system in the first Parasite Eve reminds me much of what they're doing in Final Fantasy XII right now.
2676164	2681528	How that system, you know, kind of, you have a big dome or whatever that you can attack in and stuff.
2681908	2683669	It reminds me very much of that.
2684847	2688208	Well, before we get to the Skype line, I got one more story for you guys.
2688428	2694570	And since it is July 1st, also known as Canada Day, I thought those of you Canadians would appreciate this.
2695810	2699771	You can get a red PlayStation 3, and it's a special kind of Canada event.
2699791	2701052	You can only get this in Canada.
2701632	2706854	And it's actually a contest that's being held, and the contest is being run through July 15th at playstation.ca.
2708554	2715858	and you can actually win yourself a red PlayStation 3 or a limited edition Canada PlayStation 3 t-shirt there.
2716218	2719000	It doesn't have the maple leaf on it, but it has a 3 in place of the maple leaf.
2719020	2721261	Otherwise, it kind of looks like the Canadian flag.
2721781	2722261	So there you go.
2723002	2726904	Only three of those red PlayStation 3s, by the way, will be made.
2727624	2728404	So that's kind of neat.
2728825	2732747	Well, technically four, since there's already been a red PlayStation 3 out there custom made.
2732847	2733647	Well, that's different, though.
2733667	2737189	This is kind of officially endorsed, so to speak, by Sony, so...
2737762	2742323	I know you have some Canadian listeners there, so you might want to go enter that contest and brag to all your friends, eh?
2742723	2746564	This is completely random, but I feel that we should talk about this real quick.
2747105	2749985	We went over the fries the other day, because I had my motherboard.
2750466	2751446	There's a fan that went out.
2751486	2753726	My computer is kind of on the fritz.
2754467	2758828	But we saw, or Nelly picked up this USB stripper.
2759588	2761489	It's on a stripping pole that you can buy.
2761889	2766370	I've seen that before, because we were thinking about getting it for her for her birthday before we realized we were all freaking poor.
2767486	2768126	I thought that was funny.
2768426	2768726	I don't know.
2768846	2769527	That was great.
2769547	2771147	Did you guys actually see it in motion or what?
2772108	2773208	No, but we almost bought it.
2773648	2778810	And then, like, common sense kicked in and we said, no, we probably don't need a $30 USB stripper.
2779770	2780210	Why not?
2780670	2781070	I don't know.
2782851	2788973	Because she wanted to take it to work and, you know, her work wouldn't really, you know, think too highly of that.
2791733	2800975	Alright, well we're going to open up the Skype line if you'd like to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can call us on the actual program Skype.
2801455	2803276	Orange Lounge Radio is our username.
2803316	2809457	We always like to hear from our listeners and get your guys' two cents on what's going on in the gaming scene and the gaming community.
2809497	2816379	If you have any feedback to tonight's articles or what have you or you just want to tell Rice Princess to say hi to you and actually talk on the program tonight.
2817083	2819624	All of that you can do by calling our program.
2820104	2823446	So while we wait for some calls, because there's a little bit of a lag, do you have any last minute stories?
2823806	2823986	No.
2824666	2824926	No?
2825046	2826127	No last minute stories tonight?
2826407	2827067	Not at the moment.
2827167	2829068	Oh my gosh, it really is a slow gaming week.
2829128	2832850	I was looking for stuff, but I haven't seen anything.
2835491	2837632	Well... Should I pick up Project Silphid?
2837892	2842914	I haven't... I saw it scroll by your screen there, and I'm curious about that game, but I don't know.
2843516	2844056	It looks okay.
2844216	2845217	I want to get this t-shirt.
2845677	2864224	It looks like one of those Target t-shirts, like the don't bother me ones, and it says good, and it has, you know, the male, female, like almost looks like a restroom-like logo or something, and that's good, and then better has a guy with two girls, and then best shows a guy playing a video game.
2865165	2866525	We're finally getting calls, thank God.
2867245	2868286	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2868306	2868626	Who's this?
2872810	2874071	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2874131	2874511	Who's this?
2876752	2879614	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2880335	2880935	Who's this?
2882976	2883337	Oh, damn it.
2883357	2883837	It didn't work.
2883857	2886538	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
2887999	2888400	Wow.
2890601	2894663	If you always wanted to test your Skype line, you can do that by calling Echo123.
2894724	2900007	This is the username on Skype if you'd always like to test your connection in advance, which we highly recommend.
2900407	2901448	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2901468	2901808	Who's this?
2903100	2904141	Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.
2904381	2906363	Hey, what's up DJ Tyrant?
2906383	2906963	How you doing?
2908304	2909265	Hey, I'm doing pretty good.
2909526	2912008	I'm at Anime Expo 2007 right now.
2912328	2913209	Awesome.
2913249	2916912	Now you actually got into Anime Expo 2007 on behalf of Orange Launch Radio, right?
2917953	2918513	Yes, I did.
2918733	2921075	Alright, then you better have a good report for us.
2921095	2922537	What's going on at Anime Expo?
2924278	2926980	Lots of anime, fandom type stuff.
2927001	2929663	There's actually a lot of gaming stuff also.
2931854	2932835	What did I check out today?
2932895	2935777	I checked out the Naruto fighting game for the Wii.
2936818	2939880	Those are a little sloppy for that, though.
2939920	2940560	Wait, what was sloppy?
2940580	2941461	The controls are sloppy?
2942442	2942762	Yeah.
2942962	2943482	Oh, that sucks.
2945384	2951148	But there's Guilty Gear, the new one, XX, forget the subtitle for that.
2951488	2952069	Accent Core.
2953670	2954951	Loki says it's Accent Core.
2956552	2957532	Yeah, that sounds right.
2958873	2960835	I didn't get to play it, but it looked pretty solid.
2961960	2962260	Yeah, they are.
2962280	2963902	Apparently Square has a bunch of stuff for Eleven.
2963982	2966524	I didn't get to swing by their booth because I don't play Eleven, but...
2980498	2983459	I saw a lot of people with stuff from Final Fantasy XI Yeah, there's
3008919	3009699	Tons.
3010120	3015683	As the resident's wow addict, I found about three really, really good costumes.
3016243	3021726	And I'll post some pictures up when I get home, but they're, like, really well done.
3021766	3025548	They look exactly like they look in game, which I found really impressive.
3026949	3032031	Now, Ranma would like to point out, for those of us here, that Anime Expo is not an anime con.
3032391	3033491	It's a trade show.
3034032	3035652	And apparently there's a very distinct difference.
3035672	3039294	I guess because I don't follow the con scene enough, it kind of feels the same to me.
3042955	3044936	Well, what about, you said there was some gaming stuff there.
3044956	3045776	What about tournaments?
3045796	3046996	Has there been any big tournaments?
3047016	3048397	I know these cons usually have a game room.
3048417	3050118	What kinds of stuff have been around in the game rooms?
3050178	3053819	There's a pretty big console room with Guitar Hero and
3054707	3057149	The typical fighting type games.
3058050	3065277	There was a Pokemon tournament last night and there's been various fighting game tournaments for Guilty Gear and Naruto.
3066158	3067079	There's a Smash Bros.
3067099	3070862	tournament tomorrow that I will be playing in and losing in the first round in.
3070882	3074766	There's definitely a lot of stuff for gamers to do at the show.
3075762	3076242	Super Smash Bros.
3076262	3077483	Tournament Super Smash Bros.
3077503	3078543	Tournament Super Smash Bros.
3078563	3078803	Tournament
3106803	3108083	So how long is the con running?
3109344	3111985	How long is the con?
3112045	3112785	It ends tomorrow?
3113746	3113966	Yeah.
3113986	3117948	Alright, well make sure you go get your hands on Guilty Gear for us so you can give some impressions of it.
3118288	3120929	Definitely will.
3121029	3129212	Ranma would like to clarify, Anime Expo is a trade show because their board of directors are people from the anime industry and they use Anime Expo to promote new titles more than any other con.
3129533	3132034	Think of Anime Expo as the anime equivalent of E3.
3133194	3134355	and Insanus adds to that.
3134515	3136276	Also, Anime Expo sucks.
3136416	3137637	Well, that's an opinion.
3137877	3139639	But you sound like you're having a lot of fun at the con, right?
3140019	3140539	Right, Jimmy?
3140559	3143061	He just wants to kick you because he can't come to it.
3144242	3146944	All right, well, Jimmy, anything else you want to add about the convention?
3148865	3150587	If you can come next year, we can come hang out.
3150647	3151187	I'll buy drinks.
3151988	3153789	Oh, hey, if there's drinks there, I'm there.
3154309	3157512	But, you know, I will be in SoCal for E for All, so we'll see you then.
3158893	3160214	All right, have a nice night, guys.
3160334	3160894	All right, later, buddy.
3161334	3161875	Thanks for the call.
3161895	3162215	All right.
3162748	3163188	Bye.
3163428	3166589	Our roving reporter, Jimmy, also known as DJ Tyrant.
3167409	3168510	All right, let's go to the phones.
3169010	3169970	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3169990	3170370	Who's this?
3171490	3172391	It's GS68.
3172611	3173851	Hello, GS68.
3173871	3174811	What's on your mind, my friend?
3175792	3179653	First of all, that was me calling before Matt because my mic wasn't set up right.
3180533	3180973	That's all right.
3180993	3181613	We'll forgive you.
3181853	3185254	Could you hear us yelling at you in Spanish and everything?
3185874	3186174	Yeah.
3186554	3186855	All right.
3187795	3188635	That's got to be embarrassing.
3188675	3189615	All right, well, now you're on.
3189895	3190356	What's on your mind?
3191376	3192096	First of all, I have...
3192475	3197657	I was eating cup noodles when Rice Princess was saying fag or anger so I had to spit that out.
3200098	3201398	What else do you want to talk about tonight, GS68?
3217546	3224148	On the Guitar Hero message board, I've been talking about the hyperspeed code lately and how some people think it's a cheat.
3224468	3225348	What are your thoughts on it?
3225628	3227269	I do not know of the hyperspeed code.
3227309	3228329	Give me a little background on this.
3228369	3228889	What's this about?
3230549	3240052	On the Guitar Hero 2 title screen, you press orange, blue, orange, yellow, orange, blue, orange, yellow, and then it says cheat activated hyperspeed.
3241252	3242572	And what exactly does that do to the game?
3242612	3244533	Does it make the songs run faster or something?
3245357	3247378	No, it makes the notes scroll faster.
3247558	3252019	It's kind of like times two speed in DDR or high speed in Beatmania.
3253320	3254220	Oh, okay.
3254240	3255941	Well, I don't know if that's cheating or not.
3255961	3261302	I mean, I guess maybe the developers intended it to be a cheat if that's what they're labeling it as in the game.
3261403	3262303	But I don't know.
3262343	3264664	Like in Beatmania, I never considered that a cheat.
3264704	3267745	I mean, God, that's what you have to use to play some of those songs.
3267785	3268465	I don't know any other way.
3268865	3269365	But I don't know.
3269625	3271626	Maybe it is cheating even in Beatmania.
3271666	3274467	And for whatever reason, the community doesn't really look at it that way.
3275071	3279033	But I think they just never looked at it that way because it's always been considered a modifier.
3279694	3279914	Yeah.
3280874	3293681	Because, like, people whose music game experience is one of the Guitar Hero, like, have never heard of it being a mod, so when they saw that it was a cheat, they automatically thought it was a cheat because it has cheat activated.
3294102	3295342	What are your thoughts on it?
3296523	3297904	Well, I think it's legit.
3297944	3302767	I mean, if you think it helps you, just use it.
3302807	3303067	I mean...
3305769	3312014	I mean, it's still the same notes, right?
3312615	3312855	Yeah.
3312995	3315297	And it's not going to help you beat Jordan on Expert, right?
3316618	3317819	Probably, probably not.
3318080	3320482	So, what's the big freaking deal?
3322303	3326967	I mean, if you close your eyes and play the song, I mean, does Hyper Speed really make a difference?
3328668	3332151	Well, if you close your eyes and play the song, is that how you have to beat Jordan on Expert?
3332191	3332812	Probably, huh?
3338818	3346142	If you've actually gone to the great extents to memorize Guitar Hero 2 songs, instead of using the speed modifier, I would recommend you go outside.
3349163	3349804	I'm just messing.
3349824	3350884	Hypothetically speaking.
3351144	3352045	I know, I know.
3352325	3355386	Hey, people memorize the DDR songs, so why not the Guitar Hero songs?
3355786	3356147	It happens.
3357267	3358628	Alright, well, any other thoughts, GS68?
3358648	3358768	No.
3358788	3358828	No.
3361343	3362003	That's pretty much it
3390971	3391552	Nothing much.
3392132	3394213	Thought y'all would talk about Soul Calibur for a little bit.
3394714	3396975	I wanted to touch up on something I discussed last week.
3397236	3399837	Sure, Soul Calibur 4 online, good stuff.
3399897	3400258	What's up?
3401659	3404981	There's supposed to be like a sad story game, Soul Calibur Legends.
3406182	3409644	Yes, that was the game that's being created for the Nintendo Wii if I remember right, right?
3409784	3412366	It's not side-scrolling though, it's just kind of a hack and slash.
3415989	3419371	Wasn't that how Mortal Kombat, what was that, Shaolin Monks or whatever was kind of like that?
3419591	3419771	Yeah.
3420052	3420452	Oh, okay.
3421245	3437409	I was thinking more of Tekken Force I would say it looks more like the Immortal Combat Channel amongst games Because I know Tekken Force is more like Final Fight or something like that Here's the only thing I care about, is Ivy in it, yes or no?
3438130	3438890	Yes Sold!
3438910	3446632	I think it would be a multiple problem round 6 for you, I think, if I'm not mistaken Alright, well what else have you heard on the game?
3448579	3450880	Um, just early development details and whatnot.
3450900	3460385	They had a picture on it on Kotaku.com and it just looked like a test shot because all it saw was basically Siegfried swinging his sword around a bunch of mummies.
3462846	3467649	I mean, I like the concept and all, so.
3468629	3472291	Is it the type of game you think you're going to buy?
3472311	3473192	I don't own a Wii, so.
3473692	3474752	Oh, you don't own a Wii.
3475513	3478014	Is that because you don't want one or because you can't find one?
3479811	3480552	Um, both.
3481152	3483654	Um, I actually decided that I was gonna go get, um, 360.
3484254	3484794	Ah, okay.
3485235	3485535	Alright.
3485955	3488216	But that won't be until November, so that would offset itself.
3488336	3491158	Well, you never know, you might luck out, maybe the game will come out cross-platform.
3492699	3494540	Uh, yeah, give it time and whatnot.
3494801	3499003	Um, another game I had on mind, but I think I just totally lost track.
3500064	3502105	Uh, Guitar Hero 80s.
3502465	3505107	Um, I actually saw the, um, song list and everything.
3505549	3507310	And there are actually some decent songs in that list.
3507350	3510252	I don't know why some of y'all didn't like some of the songs.
3510412	3511732	Yeah, what's your problem, Rice Princess?
3511752	3513373	Why didn't you like Guitar Hero's 80s editions?
3513613	3515054	What's your big issue?
3515074	3518216	Well, if I knew any of the songs, I might like it better.
3518766	3520087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3548519	3549480	You're a baby.
3550481	3553264	Do you remember Friendship Bracelets and Garbage Pail Kids?
3553444	3555026	Yeah, do you remember Slap Bracelets?
3555146	3555687	Yes, I do.
3555847	3557269	Yeah, those were pretty awesome.
3557529	3558390	And Hypercolor shirts.
3558430	3559571	Yeah, anyway.
3559871	3560492	All right, anyhow.
3561133	3562975	Well, then I don't know what her problem is.
3563035	3564617	She was just listening to the wrong kind of music in the 80s.
3565523	3566724	The wrong kind of music?
3566804	3567184	No, I don't.
3567504	3570346	I have to admit, I'm not that excited about the track list either, Dark Knight.
3570366	3572187	There's some songs that made me go, woohoo!
3572567	3574428	But a lot of it kind of makes me go, hmm.
3575208	3576309	Not really a memorable song.
3576589	3579490	But what to you makes a song list great?
3579530	3580351	Convince us we're wrong.
3581892	3582532	Give me Stairway.
3583052	3584673	I mean, Turning Japanese might be one.
3585153	3588315	But if I had the power to add a song, give me Stairway to Heaven.
3588875	3589636	I know exactly.
3589816	3590896	No Stairway denied.
3592937	3593218	I know.
3593278	3593578	Wow.
3595455	3596416	Dark Knight, we gotta let you go.
3596456	3597737	Any last thoughts real quick?
3599698	3604581	Also, you need to start playing PSU again because, well, that's right, you have 360.
3604621	3605642	You probably already got it.
3606122	3608644	But they recently gave out Sonic statues.
3609444	3609704	Really?
3609804	3615288	No, God, I haven't touched the game in forever, but I think my membership's still active and I'm paying for it.
3615308	3616949	I just haven't gone into the game in forever, so...
3618049	3618429	We'll see.
3618469	3620211	Yeah, everybody got Sonic statue now.
3620371	3620791	You know what?
3621572	3623894	Pull me away from World of Warcraft, seriously.
3623974	3628037	And I feel like, I know I'm going to get so much hate mail like, Rob, play a real game, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3628377	3634602	But I can't explain how addicting this game is and it's the social end of it completely because the fact that a lot of my friends play it.
3635122	3637324	It's not even really the game itself that I'm in love with.
3637684	3638745	I'm in love with Ventrilo.
3639126	3640026	That's my problem.
3640627	3644370	I'm not going to go into detail about the Ventrilo thing.
3645611	3647312	But I think it's just right now the game
3648214	3651177	I think it's kind of winding down now because the expansion is coming.
3651998	3657683	Well, hopefully the expansion will give it a badly needed kick in the pants because I would like to get back into some PSU.
3659144	3659444	Yeah.
3659705	3668292	But anyway, quick plug for my show because I do a show on Disney Genius Radio, Dark Knight Ninja Dojo on Thursday nights.
3668553	3669694	Welcome to join if you like.
3671015	3673157	Basically going to be talking about this week, the iPhones.
3674023	3674884	Ooh, iPhone.
3674904	3675604	I saw one this week.
3675625	3676245	They're very pretty.
3676485	3680708	Well, I will try to tune in and I think I'm supposed to be on the show this week or very soon, yes?
3682089	3682450	Yes.
3682930	3683130	Yes.
3683470	3684892	Scott will be there, hopefully.
3685592	3687894	Yes, I just have to double check my personal calendar, but I should be there.
3689415	3689715	Okay.
3689815	3690156	Alright.
3690536	3691517	That's it.
3691777	3692617	Alright, take care, buddy.
3692637	3693218	Thanks for calling.
3694579	3694999	Bye, folks.
3695259	3695500	Alright.
3695700	3697281	Dark Knight here on Orange Launch Radio.
3697301	3697361	Bye.
3698263	3700524	and everybody's got their own show these days.
3700584	3701225	I swear to God.
3701725	3702245	Swear to God.
3702686	3703406	No, it's all good though.
3703426	3704026	I like Dark Knight.
3704747	3706948	Hi, you're on.
3708429	3710010	I'm going to punch that guy in the face.
3710130	3711110	You know who you are.
3711210	3711951	Punch him in the neck.
3711971	3713111	You told me you fixed it.
3716233	3717133	Now that's another edit.
3718594	3719095	Ah, forget it.
3719115	3719995	I'm not going to edit that out.
3720215	3721776	Podcast listeners, you guys can deal with it.
3721956	3722456	Way to be lazy.
3722516	3723617	That was DMN, by the way.
3723637	3727079	If you want to hate somebody for blowing your ears out, that was Insanest
3727520	3729161	DMM, whatever the hell your name is right now.
3730041	3730522	Love you!
3731502	3732423	Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.
3732443	3732763	Who's this?
3734484	3735104	Mushy Mushy.
3735765	3736485	Mushy Mushy?
3736505	3739647	No, it's relevant.
3740107	3741248	Oh, like you're saying hello.
3744570	3745210	I hear myself.
3746050	3746531	It's okay.
3746571	3747771	Sometimes there is a bit of an echo.
3748172	3749192	Identify yourself, please.
3749913	3751393	Oh, uh, Nintendo Maniac 64.
3751494	3752314	Nintendo Maniac 64.
3752974	3753915	What's on your mind, my friend?
3754895	3755716	Well, dealing with the
3756381	3759022	What was it?
3759062	3763384	You got a letter... Is this your first Japanese listener on the show?
3763784	3765665	A letter in the book?
3765985	3776570	No, I think Peker Uno is also in Japan from my following him on Twitter, because I actually have a Twitter account, and some of the listeners have me added on there as Sky on Twitter, and I picked up that he's in Japan.
3777050	3779692	So... Is he really Japanese, though?
3780392	3783733	I haven't the foggiest idea, but I'm sure I'm going to get a Twitter about it now.
3784194	3784334	So...
3786287	3789489	We don't even know if our guy's message is Japanese.
3789749	3791210	Actually, I've looked at the statistics.
3791270	3792631	We do have some Japanese listeners.
3792651	3795213	We have listeners all over the world, just not all of them are vocal.
3795253	3799516	But I understand, it takes a lot of effort to write an email, so no expectations.
3799936	3808261	But I don't think this guy's the first one, but he's the first email I can recall getting from Japan, but we have had emails from other parts of Asia.
3809322	3809582	Okay.
3809862	3815326	Other than that, oh yeah, you know how I was talking about earlier with the
3816078	3816238	Outro
3840521	3844023	So I don't know, well, I don't know, because culturally over here, that's not really a bad word.
3844084	3847826	But I suppose, you know, if the game had called me a fag, I may not have liked that.
3847866	3849527	Wait, you know who we could ask?
3849587	3850308	Wait, no, wait.
3850628	3851469	Where is it a bad word?
3851529	3851949	In England?
3852069	3852309	Yes.
3852870	3854170	We could ask Sasha.
3854190	3855071	I don't think he's listening.
3855111	3855932	I don't see him in chat tonight.
3855972	3856412	He's not listening.
3856432	3857293	No, he listens to your show.
3857353	3857953	He's sleeping.
3857993	3858233	Yeah, he does.
3858253	3858533	That's right.
3858553	3860855	It's kind of late over there in Britain right now, so we don't have a lot of time.
3860875	3862336	Yeah, but I'll ask him.
3862696	3862996	All right.
3863096	3863537	You do that.
3863797	3865858	Call him a spastic and see what happens.
3866059	3866679	Oh, no.
3866939	3868900	He might make me number two on his MySpace.
3869261	3869541	Anyway.
3871098	3877099	I love how Rice Princess' biggest concern in the world is that OMG, I might get demoted in the top 8 on Myspace.
3877299	3878180	Yeah, pretty much.
3878340	3879500	Get a life, woman.
3879720	3880320	I can't.
3880620	3882981	It's never going to happen.
3884841	3887602	Well, Orange Lounge Radio has a Myspace, so I can't complain too much.
3887882	3889422	Alright, Nintendo Maniac, anything else on your mind?
3890683	3893183	Yeah, I finally, finally got TimeSplitters 2.
3893343	3894484	I've been trying to find it forever.
3894904	3895464	Finally got it.
3895784	3900605	And that brick-smashing glass level, I got gold in it, and like
3904048	3908269	It gets harder as you pass through some of the levels in there.
3908309	3909669	What exactly do you do in this level, Loki?
3909709	3912670	Well, there's, like, they have different levels, like, breaking stuff.
3913030	3915790	Usually it'll be with a brick or something, and you have to smash windows.
3916530	3920771	And, um, you have to throw a brick through it, and it's pretty hard.
3920991	3924592	You have to go through and... I think it's a little shorter, actually, if I think of it.
3925152	3925693	Either way.
3925713	3926033	All right.
3928228	3932349	Well, we're going to go ahead and let you go, buddy, but thanks so much for giving us a call and enjoy TimeSplitters, okay?
3933330	3933550	Yeah.
3933790	3934410	All right.
3934770	3935050	Later.
3936111	3936291	Bye.
3937311	3937571	All right.
3938231	3940112	Well, that's going to do it tonight for the Skype line.
3940132	3941372	Sorry to those calls we didn't get to.
3941412	3945194	We did have a lot of calls coming through, but we have a lot.
3945414	3946554	We've been on the air quite a while now.
3946574	3947474	We've got to wrap things up.
3947775	3949875	So let's go around now.
3949935	3952676	Since there's no last-minute stories, we're going to go around and get everybody's... No, no, no.
3952736	3953396	That's not the case.
3953557	3954357	Oh, you found something.
3954377	3954797	Well, of course.
3954817	3957378	I was taking the time to pull up the stories.
3957558	3957918	Go for it.
3958564	3965568	And the rumor is, apparently, Beautiful Katamari is going to be skipping the PlayStation 3 and going straight to the Wii.
3966048	3970610	And it's supposed to be coming out next year on the Wii.
3971751	3974972	Although, to be honest, though, I would say it's coming out in both fiscal year 2008.
3975053	3977774	That's just my guess, though.
3978014	3979535	Didn't you get in trouble for that once before?
3979555	3981516	Uh, no.
3982396	3983677	Um, I'm guessing...
3984275	3987876	I don't know, but if I were to guess, I would say it's coming fiscal year 2008.
3988397	3990617	I honestly don't give a fuck anymore.
3990777	3991238	Who cares?
3991358	3993058	I don't give a fuck.
3993278	3998340	Let the game come out wherever it's going to come out, and maybe I'll buy it if it's not just a copy of the first game.
3998500	3998921	Exactly.
4000741	4004182	Anyways, so some other stuff that's going to be interesting.
4005603	4010725	This was kind of a surprise to me, although this is one of the only films of his I'm going to go see.
4011385	4013446	Postal is being called...
4014397	4014837	What the hell?
4014918	4016579	My microphone went out there for a second.
4016659	4018321	No, I turned the audio in the studio down.
4018341	4018581	Oh, sorry.
4018621	4018941	You're fine.
4019442	4031413	Anyways, Postal is being called one of the best films, and apparently it got standing ovations at Cannes, which is very surprising, but I don't know.
4031533	4035357	Everybody at the Cannes Film Festival is on ecstasy, apparently.
4036137	4037699	It says, anyways, it says,
4038784	4040965	Uwe Boll calls it his final statement.
4041065	4044226	He says, you can't make a more radical movie.
4044566	4046707	There is no way you can ignore Postal.
4046927	4051008	It's one of the funniest and most important films of the last decade.
4051708	4053769	It is one of the best films of all time.
4053809	4055410	Of course, this is Uwe Boll talking about himself.
4055530	4057710	Were they giving it a standing ovation because they got to leave?
4058331	4058531	Maybe.
4058951	4059271	I don't know.
4059491	4061192	I think it looks cheesy.
4061412	4062512	I know it's going to be offensive.
4063312	4064733	That's it.
4065825	4069107	DarkTetsuya says, or was Uebol just dreaming the whole thing?
4069687	4070848	Yeah, he might have been.
4072409	4073870	Some other interesting stuff.
4074030	4080574	A game that's been announced to be coming to the Wii is called The Blob, which apparently is going to be kind of similar.
4082535	4085437	There was actually a contest that was involved, a student project.
4085897	4091080	It's kind of a cross between Katamari and, I guess, I don't know, you paint buildings with this giant blob of paint.
4091833	4093234	and roll it around and stuff.
4093254	4094054	So it looks kind of neat.
4094374	4096135	Will the game also feature a boy?
4096155	4098276	Uh, no.
4098556	4099997	So it can be a boy in his blob.
4100057	4100337	Get it.
4101097	4101918	Yeah, I got it.
4101978	4102738	Oh my god.
4103838	4109441	Um, and then real quick, um, some of the virtual console games coming out here in the next few weeks.
4109481	4111122	At least it's TurboGrafx-16 stuff.
4111162	4112702	This ought to make Christopher happy.
4113243	4114983	But, um, let's see.
4115323	4116124	It's got to be Devil's Crush.
4116144	4116884	Devil's Crush.
4116924	4117344	I knew it.
4117785	4121006	Uh, Air Zonk, Drop Off, and Silent...
4121696	4122257	Debuggers.
4122437	4123579	Where the fuck is Splatterhouse?
4124420	4125822	Splatterhouse came out, I thought already.
4125922	4126242	Did it?
4126503	4126843	Yeah.
4127925	4128506	Well, shit.
4128566	4129607	I need to go back and get it.
4130268	4131129	It's been out for a while.
4131189	4132291	Actually, Splatterhouse kind of sucked.
4132451	4132731	Exactly.
4132751	4133613	Maybe I skipped over it.
4133713	4135135	We had this conversation before.
4135175	4135495	Did we?
4136336	4136697	Never mind.
4137664	4147907	And then, of course, if you are pre-ordering your Eternal Sonata at GameStop, you will be receiving one of these wonderful faceplates.
4148167	4149747	Oh, my God, those things are gorgeous.
4149787	4150307	Wait, what?
4150547	4151828	I want to see, I want to see, I want to see.
4151848	4152348	They are gorgeous.
4152368	4156309	Receive one of five custom faceplates for Eternal Sonata for your 360.
4156469	4158049	I never pre-order games.
4158089	4159350	This might make me do it.
4159390	4160490	Do you get to pick which one, though?
4160510	4160750	I don't know.
4160770	4161490	I guess you don't know yet, huh?
4162550	4163391	Those are beautiful.
4164691	4164951	All right.
4166038	4166979	That's it.
4167379	4167739	All right.
4167799	4170220	So now we can go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4170500	4173242	And we'll start with Rice Princess, who's been oh so quiet tonight.
4173882	4176243	But thank you for being here and for your moral support, nonetheless.
4176444	4177064	Oh, you're welcome.
4177324	4178345	And what's your final thought?
4182227	4182527	I don't know.
4183868	4184468	I don't have anything.
4185388	4186109	Fag your anger.
4186309	4186549	All right.
4186589	4186949	Thank you.
4187209	4188410	Loki, what's your final thought?
4189551	4192212	My final thought is I get a kitty this week.
4193654	4199298	My final thought is now I'm craving In-N-Out Burger after watching Rice Princess stuff one down her face.
4199738	4201399	So I really want an In-N-Out Burger now.
4201659	4203260	Thank you very much for making me crave that.
4203460	4204040	Totally welcome.
4204060	4204861	Because they're not healthy.
4205201	4205601	I know.
4206002	4206542	That's why I got it.
