0	5700	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5700	11700	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11700	15000	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19500	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19500	24900	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, July the 1st of 2007.
24900	29300	If you haven't heard part A of our program yet, go back to wherever you got this episode,
29300	33500	whether it be iTunes or Digg or wherever you got this, and look for part A
33500	36100	because Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two parts every week.
36100	38900	It's the little announce in the beginning of the show told you.
38900	41100	So why am I repeating myself? I don't know.
41100	42900	So let's get back to the gaming news.
42900	47800	There's an interesting little blog post I've seen pop up on Engadget
47800	54700	showing someone that's modded a Wii remote with a Zapper gun from the Nintendo Entertainment System.
54700	58500	Now what they've done with this, and you might be wondering why the hell would they do this,
58500	63600	is they've actually kind of repositioned the IR sensor that's in the front of the Wii remote
63600	65300	to the front of the Zapper gun.
65300	70300	And of course the trigger on the Zapper gun is now the B button for the Wii remote.
70300	75800	So I guess you could actually use that sort of as, you know, a first person shooter controller
75800	78500	or something kind of like that.
78500	81000	Pretty neat, I don't know.
81000	84000	Better than some of the stuff that's out there right now, that's for sure.
84000	84900	Huh.
84900	88600	Where's Duck Hunt on Virtual Console already?
88600	90500	So we can really get some use out of this.
90500	94600	I think Duck Hunt's going to be a little harder because a lot of those gun games now
94600	96100	it's not going to be a straight port over.
96100	98600	They've got to rebuild the whole thing for the Wii remote.
98600	100100	Oh, I guess that's kind of true, huh?
100100	103700	You can't, well can't, I mean, because basically these games run off of emulators anyway,
103700	109800	so can't the Wii remote kind of emulate a light gun in the same way that some Nintendo emulators let you use your mouse?
109800	116000	Um, I suppose, but you know, obviously the people that make the emulators aren't exactly the people that work for Nintendo either.
116000	119500	Well then again, maybe if the rumors are true about this whole Dr. Mario Wii thing
119500	123800	and the fact that the Dr. Mario is actually a new game being made for the Wii,
123800	126200	or, well I guess you shouldn't say a new game, but you know what I mean,
126200	129500	like it's something you haven't seen before, a redone version of it,
129500	132300	um, maybe Duck Hunt can get something similar.
132300	134100	I hope so, because I like, uh...
134100	138100	I guess you kind of saw that in Wii Play a little bit in that one game.
138100	143000	I would like me some Battle Clash, and some Super Scope 6 stuff.
143000	144200	Good times.
144200	146400	Alright, uh, the doctor in chat says,
146400	149300	I want some awesome 3D Duck Hunt.
149300	151500	That could be kind of interesting.
151500	155000	Shadow Charlie says, but isn't there supposed to be a Zapper adapter coming soon?
155000	158800	There is something that's officially going to come out at some point pretty soon.
158800	163200	I imagine that, um, you know, because they were showing stuff at E3 last year
163200	167500	that looked like a shotgun kind of attachment, obviously that was, you know, more of a prototype.
167500	169800	I, you know, we might see something at E3.
169800	173100	I mean, that's when they drop bombs like that, you know,
173100	174800	hey, this is going to be coming out soon.
174800	177100	I still say, if this Dr. Mario Wii thing is true,
177100	178800	I think you're going to see it at E3 week.
178800	181900	I think that would be a nice little bombshell, you know, that whole little like,
181900	184700	you know, now especially that you have the downloadable content, you know,
184700	186300	and all that to push things,
186300	188000	I think you're going to see that really used this year,
188000	190100	because Xbox did it last year in a great way, and, you know,
190100	193500	I think, uh, Wii and Sony are hopefully going to do it as well.
193500	196400	Anyhow, uh, moving on to other Nintendo related things,
196400	198600	a lot of folks are very excited about Contra IV.
198600	199600	Have you seen some of the videos?
199600	200300	Mm-hmm.
200300	201000	Looks pretty hot.
201000	201500	Oh, yeah.
201500	205200	I mean, it's just, it's like, okay, good, you kept what worked,
205200	208900	and that's just, you know, Contra, and just made a new Contra game on the DS.
208900	209900	Looks great.
209900	212300	They just don't need to mess with it anymore.
212300	213300	This is how you do it.
213300	215600	Well, just like Castlevania.
215600	217400	Well, hopefully the game will sound great too,
217400	220300	and, uh, it's all going to be in the hands of Vert.
220300	224400	Vert, also known as Jake Kaufman, will be the composer for Contra IV.
224400	231100	Now, the reason why this is kind of cool is because Vert also founded the video game remix site, VGMix.
231100	234700	So, it's kind of interesting that he's crossing over, so to speak, with a, quote-unquote,
234700	238700	legit game, if you want to say, and he's actually going to be composing for Contra IV.
238700	239300	Pretty rad.
239300	242400	But, from what I hear, though, is he's done some legitimate games before.
242400	246100	He did, um, some games actually by the developer that's making this game,
246100	250100	because they did some other games on the DS, and he's done some music for them, original stuff.
250100	254600	This is like a really high, you know, very highly anticipated A-list title, so to speak.
254600	255100	Oh yeah.
255100	256100	So, that's pretty cool.
256100	260100	Um, but not the first time the Konami has gone to the internet to find musicians.
260100	262100	Of course, if you follow the DDR series,
262100	268100	the UltraMix and Universe series have previously had a competition to put indie artists in the game.
268100	269100	Yes.
269100	272100	Um, another thing that people might be looking for,
272100	276100	I mean, granted, the classic controller is pretty good for fighting games,
276100	280100	but, you know, when you're looking for something just a little bit better and a little bit more like the arcade,
280100	283100	uh, well, you might be turning to a company like HORI,
283100	287100	and they're actually going to be releasing a fighting stick for the Wii,
287100	292100	which I imagine would be kind of hooking up to the Wii Remote, very similar to, like, the classic controller.
292100	296100	But, I mean, this is everything that you could possibly want in an arcade stick.
296100	298100	Um, it looks awesome.
298100	305100	Perfect for, you know, Street Fighter II Turbo, or, uh, of course, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core.
305100	308100	I was going to say, all those original Wii fighting games that the Wii doesn't have right now.
308100	310100	I mean, they'll have Guilty Gear soon, but, you know.
310100	313100	Well, virtual console stuff, and this will also be good for, like, arcade games and stuff.
313100	317100	Hey, you know what, you don't necessarily, not a lot of people really pick up these arcade sticks.
317100	319100	It's, you know, the people that really are into their hardcore.
319100	320100	Fucking hardcore.
320100	322100	You know, games like that, so.
322100	327100	Can I use it, uh, backwards compatible with GameCube, like, for Soul Calibur action?
327100	335100	Uh, probably not, because, you know, this is going to be hooking up via, you know, the expansion port on the Wii Remote.
335100	340100	So, since you can't use the Wii Remote or classic controller on GameCube games, you're out of luck.
340100	349100	And you probably wouldn't be able to anyways, because, I mean, there's really only one, you know, directional button, or directional joystick on there, and eight buttons.
349100	355100	So, you wouldn't have all the analog sticks and stuff that the GameCube would have.
355100	358100	Oh, well.
358100	361100	Sorry, I was just responding to some comments in chat there.
361100	364100	Somebody who just joined, who hasn't changed their nickname yet, says,
364100	368100	Why can't the PSP get Contra IV? Why didn't Contra IV go to the PSP?
368100	371100	And Rama responded, because the PSP sucks ass.
371100	374100	And I was like, play FF1.
374100	381100	It doesn't suck ass, but I think that this game, you know, would work pretty good on the DS.
381100	386100	I mean, after all, Contra, you know, the first three Contra games were on, you know, the Nintendo system.
386100	393100	So, only fitting that, you know, Contra IV come to the DS.
393100	399100	Well, one game that may not be coming out for the DS much longer, no, just kidding, these games sell like hotcakes,
399100	404100	but there was a brain game called Mind Quiz that came out for the Nintendo DS.
404100	410100	And the BBC is reporting that the game is actually being pulled by the manufacturer.
410100	418100	It was released by Ubisoft, and somebody got their panties in a bunch over a derogatory term that was used in the game.
418100	424100	Now, the BBC article never names the term by name, but I think I speculate I figured out what it is here.
424100	429100	But basically what happened, let's see, a Belfast woman actually called the BBC
429100	435100	and talked to Radio Astur's Nolan show, and actually said here,
435100	441100	quote, I thought it was absolutely appalling that a word like this should be used to describe someone who has not achieved very well.
441100	445100	Apparently, she was playing this game in the hospital right after she gave birth to her son,
445100	450100	and I guess she didn't do so well in one stage, and the game called her a derogatory name.
450100	456100	The three-year-old, by the way, to put this in perspective, her three-year-old suffered from cerebral palsy
456100	461100	and was also severely brain damaged, so she was kind of, that's not funny, why are you laughing?
461100	466100	No, I'm just thinking of what the word was, you know, not the situation, that's really sad.
466100	471100	Yeah, I know, and the lady was very shocked because she performed poorly in this one stage,
471100	477100	and the game called her, quote, it raided her efforts in a manner derogatory to the disabled.
477100	481100	So I'm thinking the word is retarded? I guess?
481100	485100	Which, you know, is a word, I'll admit, we do it here on the program,
485100	489100	a lot of, you know, we throw that word around sometimes and not really think about what it really means.
489100	497100	Well, you have to understand that we, I mean, the word retard means to slow or, you know, to, I guess,
497100	501100	I don't know, basically slow, you know, retarding something.
501100	508100	You know, retard your anger, you know, that was in anger management.
508100	514100	That's what I'm going to tell the Loki next time the subject of Apple comes up, retard your anger.
514100	517100	No, but seriously, in music you use that term.
517100	521100	That's how you use the word. It's unfortunate, it's just like, you know, what is it, fag.
521100	528100	You know, people, it is, you know, to describe a cigarette and stuff, but it's, you know, slang in the UK,
528100	532100	but over here, you know, we use it as, you know, what I get called.
532100	533100	Yeah.
533100	534100	Yes, exactly.
534100	537100	Fag your anger, Rob.
537100	540100	Well, anyway, I really don't know what to think about this.
540100	544100	I mean, on one hand I'm like, oh, this person's overreacting and ruining the fun for the rest of us,
544100	547100	but at the same time you kind of go, well...
547100	550100	Why did you buy a brain training game like that?
550100	552100	But I don't know, I don't know what to think.
552100	558100	I'm really looking for chatroom comments on this to see what you guys think of this story here,
558100	559100	because I don't know what to think.
559100	561100	I don't know if she's being too sensitive.
561100	566100	I don't know if, you know, maybe it is appropriate.
566100	569100	I think mine was by Ubisoft, so shame on them.
569100	571100	What do you think, Rice Princess?
571100	574100	Do you have an opinion on this?
574100	576100	Because you haven't really been talking the rest of the show otherwise,
576100	578100	so I'm trying to encourage you to participate.
578100	582100	Yeah, I'm totally looking at my life journal.
582100	584100	I don't know, it really depends on what the word actually is.
584100	587100	I just think that they should have included that in the article.
587100	593100	Otherwise, it could be something like, you know, I don't know, farty butt or something, you know, being the actual word.
593100	594100	I've never heard a farty butt.
594100	595100	You're so dumb.
595100	596100	Oh!
596100	600100	I've never heard a farty butt be used for a derogatory term that is disabled.
600100	607100	I personally think it's the word Cali from Battlestar Galactica, because she's retarded.
607100	611100	But you use that word in a derogatory manner.
611100	612100	I do, don't I?
612100	613100	I do, I do.
613100	614100	That's not nice.
614100	615100	It isn't nice at all.
615100	616100	Let's see.
616100	617100	I'm not a nice person.
617100	620100	Looking at chat room, Wonder Dog Harold says,
620100	623100	Heaven forbid the lady plays a You Don't Know Jack game and gets insulted.
623100	625100	Rama says, You guys are a bunch of fags.
625100	631100	Ross Steel UT says, A derogatory term for the disabled has no place in a brain training game.
631100	633100	Dark Knight says, It's the French.
633100	635100	You know, Ubisoft.
635100	638100	Girl Bakura says, Something with the word spastic.
638100	642100	Maybe like a spaz or a, I don't know, maybe could be the word there.
642100	645100	Let's see.
645100	648100	Azurame says, I think she is right.
648100	652100	I work in the mental field and they could get in some serious trouble if told to the right people.
652100	657100	Rama also says, Whatever happened to sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.
657100	659100	Interesting.
659100	662100	So there you go.
662100	666100	And ACHP says, The word was spastic.
666100	672100	So maybe, that isn't, like I would, is spastic really that bad?
672100	674100	Have I just been ignorant all these years?
674100	675100	Ignant?
675100	676100	Why are you so ignorant?
676100	678100	I don't know.
678100	681100	Spastic I don't think is a bad term.
681100	683100	I don't know.
683100	684100	That's stupid.
684100	686100	She's spastic.
686100	688100	Fucking spaz.
688100	697100	This frustration leaves me with no other choice but to bring on one of our very favorite segments because I'm just left confused and unsure with what else to do at this point.
697100	722100	Music.
722100	724100	Alright, Loki start us off tonight.
724100	728100	Fuck you to the state of California.
728100	729100	And why?
729100	738100	Because driving on our local Highway 50 over here, it was nice to see that they've repaved the freeway.
738100	742100	The only problem is they forgot to paint lines on the freeway.
742100	749100	So there's this four lane highway that all of a sudden becomes one lane because there's no lines on it.
749100	751100	Makes it a little unsafe.
751100	752100	Just a little.
752100	756100	Especially when cars are like, well, I don't know where the lane ends.
756100	758100	So that's kind of bad.
758100	763100	Kind of something you should have, I don't know, done before you finish your project here.
763100	767100	At least put something that indicates where the lane ends and begins.
767100	772100	So fuck them because I know someone is going to get injured and hopefully sue for a lot of money.
772100	782100	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I just put in my notice I'm going to move on August 1st today and I have no place to live lined up just yet so I'll be hitting Craigslist all next week.
782100	785100	Or it might be an OLR live from your house.
785100	787100	A contest from the listeners because I'll be homeless.
787100	788100	Wow.
788100	789100	Pretty sad.
789100	790100	Yeah.
790100	791100	Rice versus.
791100	794100	FU to the weather because it's way too fucking hot.
794100	799100	And I don't have an air conditioner in my car because I'm po.
799100	802100	And I can't afford a luxury car.
802100	804100	And that's pretty much it.
804100	805100	Yeah.
805100	807100	I'm sorry too.
807100	809100	Anyhow, what are you giggling at over there, Logie?
809100	811100	Shadow's liar.
811100	817100	Fag your anger, Logie.
817100	818100	Man, that's like the best word ever.
818100	820100	If anybody hasn't left a review on iTunes.
820100	821100	Oh, damn it.
821100	822100	They're going to block that word.
822100	824100	You're not going to be able to put fag in a review on iTunes.
824100	825100	No.
825100	826100	Damn, because I was going to say like.
826100	827100	Oh, that's retarded.
827100	830100	Somebody needs to leave.
830100	831100	That's horrible.
831100	832100	I shouldn't lie.
832100	834100	I apologize if you were offended by that and the fact that I laughed at it.
834100	835100	Oh, whatever.
835100	837100	That's your automatic gut reaction.
837100	839100	You don't have to apologize for who you are, Rob.
839100	844180	But I really want to see a review on iTunes that says these guys need to learn how to
844180	847100	fag their anger.
847100	849100	Can someone make that happen?
849100	851100	Get around the word sensor somehow.
851100	853100	Put P-H-A-G or something.
853100	857100	I'll give you the link in iTunes if you want to go leave a review there for our chatters,
857100	859100	because I'm sure there's someone in there that hasn't done it.
859100	860100	Good idea.
860100	861100	Yeah.
861100	862100	There you go.
862100	866100	In sickest or insaneist in the chat says F-H-A-G, fag your anger.
866100	869100	I really want someone in the chat to leave that as an iTunes review.
869100	872100	These guys need to learn how to fag their anger.
872100	877100	Anyways, so guess what?
877100	883100	There's this brand new, well it's not brand new, but a racing series coming back to consoles
883100	885100	exclusively to the Wii.
885100	892100	It's called Cruisin' and it's going to be exclusively coming to the Wii with licensed
892100	899100	cars and whatnot, body kits, upgrades, turbos, all that fun stuff.
899100	903100	So, Cruisin' coming to the Wii.
903100	909100	To be honest, I never was a huge fan of the Cruisin' series.
909100	912100	I always thought them to be kind of cheesy and stupid.
912100	916100	I seem to remember Dark Soccer as a big fan though, so she'll probably be excited about
916100	917100	this.
917100	919100	I played the games, they were pretty fun.
919100	920100	Did anyone remember Rush?
920100	921100	Yeah.
921100	923100	Rush 2049, San Francisco Rush?
923100	929100	No, I meant the last Rush game that they released that was basically, I don't remember if it
929100	935100	was Rush, I think it was just San Francisco Rush, or they redid it for the PSP and stuff.
935100	937100	It wasn't very good.
937100	938100	Interesting.
938100	941100	So, you think this game might be a disaster as well?
941100	942100	I think it might be.
942100	946100	Just what we needed in this next gen of gaming, or new gen of gaming, whatever you want to
946100	948100	call it, another fucking racing game.
948100	949100	That sucks.
949100	953100	Even if it is a memorable one from years past.
953100	957100	Speaking of years past, if you live over in Europe, you have some new stuff on the Virtual
957100	963100	Console, and a very interesting pair that came out this week, Kirby's Dream Course,
963100	965100	which is actually a game I really enjoyed on the Super Nintendo.
965100	966100	I had that game.
966100	967100	It was a lot of fun.
967100	969100	It's like a little miniature golf game, but you use Kirby.
969100	971100	You like miniature golf games, right, Loki?
971100	974100	You'll have to check this out when it comes stateside.
974100	979100	But the other game was Bloody Wolf, which is a turbo graphics game there.
979100	980100	Bloody Wolf?
980100	983100	No, it's like a war-ish game there on the Turbo Graphics 16.
983100	987100	You get Cutesy, Cutesy Kirby, and Bloody Wolf.
987100	988100	There you go.
988100	989100	Kirby's Bloody Wolf.
989100	991100	What came out in America?
991100	992100	I totally missed it.
992100	993100	Oh, we got the F-Zero, didn't we?
993100	994100	I think so.
994100	995100	I don't know.
995100	998100	I haven't downloaded anything from Virtual Console since Zelda II, right?
998100	1000100	Wasn't that just two weeks ago?
1000100	1001100	It wasn't that long ago.
1001100	1003100	It seems like a long time ago.
1003100	1004100	There you go.
1004100	1006100	Well, some other stuff you're going to be able to download soon.
1006100	1011100	I don't know why this is a news story, because I always thought this was still on there in
1011100	1013100	the first place.
1013100	1018100	Also a reminder, if you haven't downloaded the Internet channel yet, you're now going
1018100	1019100	to have to pay for it.
1019100	1022100	So screw you guys, not that it's any good.
1022100	1027100	Not that we do have a... we don't have an O-L-O-V site, because I never made one.
1027100	1028100	Because you're lazy.
1028100	1029100	Because I'm lazy.
1029100	1034100	But anyways, there's going to be a brand new service coming to have original downloadable
1034100	1035100	titles called WiiWare.
1035100	1041100	And if I remember correctly, that's already online with I think the Internet channel,
1041100	1044100	and also the Wii Vote channel.
1044100	1045100	It's called WiiWare.
1045100	1048100	And hypothetically, this is Dr. Mario Wii, right?
1048100	1049100	Hypothetically.
1049100	1050100	2 plus 2 equals 4.
1050100	1053600	This, I'm not sure if it's going to be a brand new channel, but currently online right now
1053600	1055100	they do have a section for WiiWare.
1055100	1056800	It's been there forever.
1056800	1060480	But they just want you to remember that there is going to be a WiiWare service that's going
1060480	1065580	to be kind of like Xbox Live Arcade or the PlayStation 3 PSN networks.
1065580	1071180	So I don't know, going to be seeing some original titles, which will be cool.
1071180	1076260	And I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to find out what exactly is coming there first.
1076260	1079820	Obviously we're thinking Dr. Mario Wii.
1079820	1082300	I haven't checked the Everybody Votes channel in weeks.
1082300	1084900	Did they ever use the question I submitted to them?
1084900	1085900	I don't know.
1085900	1088100	The last one I saw was thank you or hello.
1088100	1092420	No, the question I submitted was which is funnier, clowns or rape?
1092420	1094700	I don't know if they used that though.
1094700	1097540	I'm thinking they probably didn't because I probably would have heard something about
1097540	1098540	it.
1098540	1103620	They probably would have made the gaming blog news.
1103620	1108420	Also making the gaming blog news this week is the launch of 3Speech because everybody
1108420	1110960	and their fucking mom has to have a podcast.
1110960	1112600	And so Sony started one.
1112600	1115460	They have the 3Speech podcast.
1115460	1118060	And what did they do in their first podcast?
1118060	1122100	It might not have been the first episode, but definitely they're still early on in their
1122100	1123100	podcasting life.
1123100	1126660	They've taken a shot at Major Nelson.
1126660	1131900	What's interesting though is that upon reviews of the new 3Speech podcast, 3Speech doesn't
1131900	1135860	really let you know that they work for Sony where Major Nelson kind of makes it no secret.
1135860	1137480	He does work for Microsoft.
1137480	1140180	But the interesting thing about Major Nelson, he'll say nice things about the Wii once in
1140180	1143500	a while and even PlayStation 3 if they deserve it.
1143500	1145620	So there you go.
1145620	1149820	And sorry, I laughed because I'm reading chat here.
1149820	1156580	Wonder Dog Herald suggests everybody votes question, which do you prefer, cock or vag?
1156580	1159300	I'm sure that will get through.
1159300	1160300	They're dinner meats.
1160300	1161300	Anyhow.
1161300	1162300	What the hell?
1162300	1163300	Oh, they're dinner meats.
1163300	1169100	Great way to cover that up there.
1169100	1170100	You know what?
1170100	1171100	Forget the other story.
1171100	1174100	It's just a story about Sony making fun of Major Nelson.
1174100	1175100	Who cares?
1175100	1176100	Seriously.
1176100	1177100	Keep talking about that.
1177100	1181740	I'm seriously reading this going, who cares?
1181740	1184420	They refer to Major Nelson as the unnamed blogger.
1184420	1186060	Oh my God!
1186060	1187060	No!
1187060	1188260	Why do they say he's unnamed?
1188260	1190700	He clearly has a name.
1190700	1192500	Major Nelson.
1192500	1194660	That is just pure falsity.
1194660	1196980	That's right.
1196980	1200780	I made up a word, falsity.
1200780	1201780	I don't really care.
1201780	1204460	I've listened to Major Nelson once.
1204460	1205460	Not that I have anything against the guy.
1205460	1207660	I just don't have time to listen to him.
1207660	1209780	The three speech podcast I'll probably never listen to.
1209780	1210780	So you know what?
1210780	1211780	You know what?
1211780	1212780	Listen to this podcast.
1212780	1213780	This is all you need.
1213780	1219660	Major spoiler alert here, but I hear that the next three speech podcast calls Leo Laporte's
1219660	1232480	spastic and then the next one they tell Reggie if he's made of faggot's anger.
1232480	1234020	This is kind of interesting actually.
1234020	1239340	We've been seeing a lot of these weird third party adapters and stuff come out for the
1239340	1240540	360.
1240540	1247940	This one though is being created by XMN and that's a mod company and they're actually
1247940	1253900	creating an HDMI cable for the regular non-elite 360s.
1253900	1258220	No word yet on how exactly it's going to work, but apparently it's going to allow you to
1258220	1266900	use HDMI cables obviously for 1080p on systems that may not be black and supporting a HDMI
1266900	1267980	out on it.
1267980	1272460	So the speculation I believe is that it's going to be something that has to do with
1272460	1277780	the VGA cable maybe converting the signal over to work on HDMI.
1277780	1282040	I don't know, but it should be interesting to see.
1282040	1290260	So if you want to keep an eye on that, check out xcm.cc and they have all the information
1290260	1292060	on that.
1292060	1296940	Alright, now why would I want to get an HDMI cable?
1296940	1298460	Is it really that big a difference?
1298460	1299940	I don't think it's a big difference.
1299940	1305900	It's really if you want that kind of cable for your console.
1305900	1312540	I think they're maybe worried that later on when they start using the broadcast flag and
1312540	1315780	stuff that you might need an HDMI cable.
1315780	1319020	Although I would think though if you're using this converter it's not going to work anyways.
1319020	1320020	I don't know.
1320020	1323180	It's not anything that I think you need, but whatever.
1323180	1324180	Interesting.
1324180	1328860	Also, on the Xbox 360 something you can see in this lovely new HDMI would be some of the
1328860	1333460	new achievements in the NCAA Football 08.
1333460	1337180	Now there's an achievement list and what's kind of interesting about it is that there's
1337180	1340580	actually some product placement in the achievement list.
1340580	1345020	They even use for the little icons for the achievement like Pontiac and Old Spice.
1345020	1347260	They're like actual official logos there.
1347260	1351140	I'm trying to look at what some of these are actually called, some of these achievements.
1351140	1355540	You can get the list for yourself at xbox360achievements.org.
1355540	1356540	Let's see.
1356540	1357540	There it is, yeah.
1357540	1359180	Old Spice Red Zone Perfection.
1359180	1363580	Eat a Play Now or Dynasty Mode Game with Red Zone Efficiency Rating of 100%.
1363580	1364580	You get 15 gamer points for that.
1364580	1367420	Pontiac 4th Quarter Comeback with a little Pontiac logo.
1367420	1369300	Win a Play Now or Dynasty Mode Game.
1369300	1371740	Win down by 14 to start the 4th Quarter.
1371740	1375300	You know, I don't understand, but yet still with all these corporate sponsorships and
1375300	1380220	now they're going to throw their logos into my achievements list, these games are still
1380220	1381220	$60.
1381220	1386620	It's because EA is a fucking whore when it comes to advertising in game and stuff like
1386620	1387620	that.
1387620	1391300	And Transformers is another game with big Heliosigns.
1391300	1398820	In fact, there's achievements that involve using the Heliophone sign to kill one of the
1398820	1399820	drones in the game.
1399820	1401180	You get an achievement for that.
1401180	1407140	So it's not anything relatively new, but I don't know.
1407140	1410060	And Solid Goomba in chat says, remember the Fight Night achievements?
1410060	1412300	There was like a Burger King match and all that stuff.
1412300	1415120	But the interesting thing about that, I mean, yeah, it hasn't happened in a while though
1415120	1418660	and the interesting thing about this is that these achievements actually have the company's
1418660	1419720	logos in them.
1419720	1423780	And remember that these things will show up on your gamer thing in the Xbox and when you
1423780	1425660	look on the internet and all that crap.
1425660	1427460	So it's just kind of interesting.
1427460	1430740	It's going to filthy up your profile with corporate logos.
1430740	1434780	Well, not a problem for me because I hate sports games, but I'm going to tell you this
1434780	1435780	much.
1435780	1436780	But you love achievements.
1436780	1441700	I do like achievements, but I'm not going to buy a product because I see a fucking logo
1441700	1442700	for it.
1442700	1447060	If it wasn't that easy, then these people would be making billions upon billions of
1447060	1450020	dollars just when having their logo out there.
1450020	1451460	You don't automatically go...
1451460	1453660	Well, they obviously pay for this because it works.
1453660	1454660	It's like product recognition.
1454660	1455660	Like, I don't know.
1455660	1460380	Maybe somebody sees the little old Spice logo and goes, oh yeah, I need to pick up some
1460380	1461380	deodorant.
1461380	1462380	I'll get that.
1462380	1463380	And then that's like in their mind.
1463380	1464380	I don't know.
1464380	1466380	I don't know.
1466380	1468820	But whatever.
1468820	1472020	That is kind of ridiculous, but one thing that is pretty awesome.
1472020	1475020	It's going to be Destroy All Humans 3.
1475020	1480060	It's coming out soon, and it's going to be finally making its way to Playstation 3, the
1480060	1482480	360, and the Wii.
1482480	1485740	No word exactly on what exactly is going to be in the game.
1485740	1491380	Obviously, it's probably going to be shown at E3, but Destroy All Humans is fucking awesome.
1491380	1492380	That's all I need to say.
1492380	1497280	There's a perfect example of a game that's fun because you get to blow up things and
1497280	1498980	throw cows.
1498980	1502020	I knew you would like this news.
1502020	1503020	I love the game.
1503020	1506180	You can pick up a cow with your tractor beam and then hunt it.
1506180	1507460	I notice there's a theme here.
1507460	1510540	You like these games where you get to play as aliens and do things to humans.
1510540	1511540	Not necessarily.
1511540	1512900	I like Grand Theft Auto.
1512900	1514420	I like sandbox games.
1514420	1515420	Fair enough.
1515420	1516640	So that's what's fun.
1516640	1522100	So continuing our conversation from part A a long time ago, fun to you is the sandbox
1522100	1524140	type of games where you can do whatever the fuck you want.
1524140	1528140	Games where you can do whatever the fuck you want, and usually if the game sucks, like
1528140	1532480	Driver 3, there will be things that you find in the game that are fun to do, like mess
1532480	1539860	with the AI and stuff, or make your own instant replays that are ridiculous.
1539860	1546740	Another very popular series that a lot of people like is Geometry Wars Galaxies, but
1546740	1550300	people are looking forward to Geometry War Galaxies because they like the old school
1550300	1551300	one.
1551300	1552480	GameSpot put up a video this week.
1552480	1556660	It was a demo of the upcoming Wii title, Geometry Wars Galaxies.
1556660	1560140	What kind of caused some people to turn around and go, huh?
1560140	1565300	Is that during the demo, the developer actually pauses the game and the word achievements
1565300	1566700	comes up.
1566700	1573620	So the question comes up, is this game actually secretly being developed for Xbox 360 as well?
1573620	1576620	Or are there achievements coming to the Wii?
1576620	1580260	Or is it because the game is early in development and it's a port and they just haven't gotten
1580260	1581260	rid of that yet?
1581260	1584500	I mean, there's a million different theories, but it certainly has made some people go,
1584500	1585500	huh?
1585500	1591700	Well, I think it doesn't have to have the achievement system from the 360 in order to
1591700	1592700	have achievements.
1592700	1593700	I mean, look at Resistance.
1593700	1596980	Resistance has achievements in it, but it's just for the game.
1596980	1597980	It's not anything...
1597980	1598980	Like internal achievements.
1598980	1599980	Exactly.
1599980	1601900	It's just for unlocking bonus content and stuff like that.
1601900	1602900	It's not necessarily...
1602900	1608220	EA has that even on the 360, like the Burnout games, you get those stupid trophies for everything
1608220	1609220	you do.
1609220	1610220	Yeah, exactly.
1610220	1611220	You hit the gas pedal.
1611220	1613220	You get a trophy.
1613220	1614220	Exactly.
1614220	1621180	Another interesting thing, though, coming from Geometry Wars Galaxies is they're going
1621180	1623060	to have download play in there as well.
1623060	1627860	So if you own the DS version of the game, you can actually transfer over and download
1627860	1633060	play a full version of Geometry Wars Retro Evolved onto other stuff.
1633060	1638020	Also, if you have the Wii version, you can transfer over a full version of Geometry Wars
1638020	1640100	Retro Evolved onto the DS.
1640100	1644260	So it's going to have cross-platform play that way.
1644260	1645260	It's kind of neat.
1645260	1646260	Huh.
1646260	1647260	All right.
1647260	1648260	That should be fun.
1648260	1649260	That's kind of interesting.
1649260	1650260	Wait.
1650260	1651260	So you're going to be able to download it to the DS if you have the Wii one?
1651260	1652260	Yeah.
1652260	1655860	If you have the Wii one, you'll be able to download a playable version onto the DS.
1655860	1660180	That's great, because this is a great trend that we're seeing here now that you're going
1660180	1661180	to be able...
1661180	1663940	And a lot of us theorized this was coming, that the DS and the Wii were going to be able
1663940	1664940	to work together like that.
1664940	1666420	I don't know why they don't have it before.
1666420	1675620	However, with the GameCube, Metroid Prime 2, you can download the original Metroid.
1675620	1677900	The Animal Crossing island is the thing I always think of.
1677900	1680420	Remember in Animal Crossing you could go to the island on the Game Boy?
1680420	1682420	It was awesome.
1682420	1683860	Awesome.
1683860	1689540	Now another thing that's super awesome, and that's because it's Grand Theft Auto IV, the
1689540	1690820	brand new trailer came out.
1690820	1691820	It looks pretty cool.
1691820	1697620	They didn't show a whole lot in there, but definitely going to be an awesome game.
1697620	1701700	The graphics looked a little bit scaled down from what they were before.
1701700	1706580	Obviously though, they're probably tweaking it to make sure that the frame rate is good,
1706580	1713700	but they did show some gunfights and of course car chases and all that fun stuff.
1713700	1716460	Just more of a tease right now, and I'm sure there's going to be a new trailer coming out
1716460	1720220	about once a month or so, especially with E3 right around the corner.
1720220	1724100	You know there's going to be something that they're going to be teasing at least.
1724100	1725620	Only a few months away now.
1725620	1730260	All right, so are you still very excited about this?
1730260	1733380	Was there any kind of revelations that the trailer had for you, or was it just more like
1733380	1734380	mouth-wetting?
1734380	1736380	It was just mouth-wetting.
1736380	1745140	They did show the main character, Nico, actually holding onto the back of a truck, being held
1745140	1749940	onto that, and then also hanging from a helicopter, which looked pretty cool.
1749940	1753360	So I don't know, it looks awesome.
1753360	1757260	I think once we see this game in action, it's just going to be phenomenal.
1757260	1763220	And I have the collector's edition on order, because I have to have all that crap that
1763220	1765220	comes with it.
1765220	1770580	All right, well we're going to get into another segment here, and we're going to go from something
1770580	1774980	very, very new to a classic segment on Orange Lounge Radio.
1774980	1779020	It's a game we like to play, especially during Slow News Week, such as this one called Beat
1779020	1780380	the Host.
1780380	1783500	And tonight on Beat the Host, we're going to be looking for a contestant to call us
1783500	1784880	on our Skype line.
1784880	1786700	Go ahead and call now if you'd like to play.
1786700	1791040	However, for tonight's Beat the Host, you should know, retro knowledge is really going
1791040	1792260	to help tonight.
1792260	1799600	So 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to play, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
1799600	1803260	So go ahead and give us a call right now, and we will take the first person to call
1803260	1805540	in on our Skype line.
1805540	1808060	And the way it's going to work, we're going to change up the rules again a little bit
1808060	1809060	tonight.
1809060	1814100	But it is going to have to do with identifying game music or game noise, and I will let you
1814100	1817500	know a little more about that when we get into the game.
1817500	1819540	All right, we're starting to get some calls on the line.
1819540	1820540	Let's go to a call.
1820540	1822180	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
1822180	1823180	Who's this?
1823180	1824180	Hey, it's Ronma.
1824180	1825180	Hi, Ronma.
1825180	1826180	Finally.
1826180	1827180	Hi, Arnie.
1827180	1828860	Finally, a normal sounding call.
1828860	1831460	All right, we have our contestant.
1831460	1832460	Stop calling everybody.
1832460	1833620	Stop calling everybody.
1833620	1836980	You guys can call later when we open up the Skype line for calls.
1836980	1839700	Ronma, you ready to play some Beat the Host?
1839700	1840700	Yeah.
1840700	1843900	All right, tonight you get to challenge Loki.
1843900	1848420	He's the only one because I already know the questions, and well, Irene, you would just
1848420	1850220	whoop her ass, I mean, no matter what the game is.
1850220	1851220	Wait, what is the topic?
1851220	1853180	The topic is Atari 2600 games.
1853180	1855060	Oh, yeah, pick Matt.
1855060	1859100	All right, so Matt, in part A, you may remember, seemed to be-
1859100	1860100	I know, I am-
1860100	1862140	He flaunted his Atari 2600 knowledge.
1862140	1864220	I just like playing Atari 2600.
1864220	1865740	It doesn't mean I played everything.
1865740	1866740	I like combat.
1866740	1867740	This is going to be tough tonight.
1867740	1870420	Because it's so tough, we're going to change up the rules of Beat the Host a little bit
1870420	1873180	tonight because you know every time we play Beat the Host, we change the rules.
1873180	1874180	Okay, Ronma?
1874180	1875180	Yeah.
1875180	1877540	Okay, so what we're going to do, I'm going to need you to speak nice and loud or I might
1877540	1879140	not hear you over the game music, okay?
1879140	1880140	All right, hold on.
1880140	1881620	Let me- I'm going to leave the chat room.
1881620	1883500	All right, yes, you need to leave the chat room.
1883500	1884500	That's good.
1884500	1885500	That's very ethical of you.
1885500	1886500	I appreciate that.
1886500	1887500	All right.
1887500	1892780	Now, what's going to happen is that we're going to play some music from Atari 2600 games.
1892780	1896420	I actually recorded myself playing some Atari 2600 games earlier today, and you're going
1896420	1897740	to hear some music from it.
1897740	1902420	The first one of you guys to shout out the correct answer gets a point, okay?
1902420	1903420	Got it.
1903420	1907360	Now, in order to help you out, because Atari 2600 tracks were kind of vague, I will give
1907360	1911180	you some hints at certain time intervals to help you guys out and hopefully one of you
1911180	1912740	guys actually gets the right answer, okay?
1912740	1913740	All right.
1913740	1914740	Cool.
1914740	1915740	All right.
1915740	1916740	You ready, Ronma?
1916740	1917740	I'm ready.
1917740	1918740	Is that as loud as you get, Ronma?
1918740	1919740	Are you able to get any louder?
1919740	1920740	Hold on.
1920740	1921900	How's that?
1921900	1922900	Much better.
1922900	1923900	All right.
1923900	1924900	Because we're really going to have to strain to hear you over these songs.
1924900	1925900	Okay, here we go.
1925900	1926900	You ready, Ronma?
1926900	1927900	Ready.
1927900	1928900	All right.
1928900	1929900	Beat the host.
1929900	1939820	Here's song, or I should say game number one.
1939820	1949020	It's based on a vector arcade game, but the Atari 2600 couldn't support vector graphics.
1949020	1951020	Yars revenge?
1951020	1952860	No.
1952860	1958860	If there was no separate hyperspace button, you use this by pulling the joystick down.
1958860	1959860	Galaxian?
1959860	1960860	No.
1960860	1962860	Can I answer?
1962860	1963860	No.
1963860	1968340	When you shoot a rock, it splits into two smaller rocks.
1968340	1969340	Asteroids.
1969340	1970340	Asteroids.
1970340	1971340	Loki got it first.
1971340	1972340	Loki gets a point.
1972340	1973340	Good job, Loki.
1973340	1974340	Good job.
1974340	1975340	Yay.
1975340	1976340	All right.
1976340	1977340	One point for Loki.
1977340	1978340	That was asteroids.
1978340	1979340	I just didn't remember the part.
1979340	1980340	All right.
1980340	1981340	All right.
1981340	1982340	Here we go.
1982340	1983340	You ready for number two, Ronma?
1983340	1984340	Yeah.
1984340	1986620	If you can get it like three seconds sooner next time, you'll be good.
1986620	1987620	No problem.
1987620	1988620	All right.
1988620	1994900	Here's song, or game number two.
1994900	1995900	Combat.
1995900	1998220	Loki got it without even a hint.
1998220	2005220	I knew he'd get it when he said he'd played all those combat back in the day.
2005220	2007380	You're not looking at my computer screen, right?
2007380	2009820	I can't see anything on your computer screen.
2009820	2010820	That was combat.
2010820	2011820	Good job.
2011820	2014260	That was the default packing game for the Atari 2600, by the way.
2014260	2015260	All right.
2015260	2016260	Here we go.
2016260	2017260	You ready for number three, Ronma?
2017260	2018260	Yeah.
2018260	2019260	You can do it.
2019260	2020260	Come on.
2020260	2021260	You're losing two nothing.
2021260	2022260	Let's see what we can do.
2022260	2024260	It's on command.
2024260	2025260	No.
2025260	2026260	Tempest.
2026260	2027260	Nope.
2027260	2041260	There's a version of this on Xbox Live.
2041260	2050460	Centipede, millipede.
2050460	2053020	Pressing the button flapped your wings.
2053020	2054540	Yars event.
2054540	2055540	No.
2055540	2056540	Joust.
2056540	2058620	Oh, you got it.
2058620	2059620	Good job.
2059620	2061300	It was joust.
2061300	2062300	Nice job.
2062300	2063300	It was joust.
2063300	2064300	All right.
2064300	2065300	Three nothing, Ronma.
2065300	2066620	You're killing me here.
2066620	2068340	Sorry, dude.
2068340	2069340	It's all right.
2069340	2070340	I still love you, man.
2070340	2071340	All right.
2071340	2072340	Here we go.
2072340	2073340	Now, this one is a tricky one.
2073340	2074340	I'm going to tell you straight up.
2074340	2075340	This one is fucking hard, all right?
2075340	2076340	So here we go.
2076340	2092180	If either of you get this, I will be very impressed.
2092180	2095780	Evil Otto was a character that would chase you.
2095780	2097780	Robotron?
2097780	2109220	Some people know this game from the big happy face bouncing creature that would stalk you.
2109220	2111220	That's Evil Otto.
2111220	2112620	Frenzy.
2112620	2114220	No.
2114220	2116700	Damn it.
2116700	2119700	You shot robots in a maze.
2119700	2121700	Robotron 20.
2121700	2122700	No.
2122700	2124700	10 seconds.
2124700	2130900	Evil Otto, big happy face bouncing creature.
2130900	2131900	Robots in a maze.
2131900	2132900	Galaxian?
2132900	2133900	Oh.
2133900	2134900	Oh.
2134900	2135900	I don't know.
2135900	2136900	Berserk.
2136900	2137900	Berserk is a game.
2137900	2138900	Berserk.
2138900	2142900	You know, I actually had the board game to that.
2142900	2143900	You what?
2143900	2147980	I actually had the board game to that like a very long time ago.
2147980	2149100	Oh, good.
2149100	2150420	You know, and oh well.
2150420	2151420	It happens.
2151420	2152420	Brain fart.
2152420	2153500	Frenzy is just like that game too.
2153500	2155420	Good job in the chat room though.
2155420	2156420	Some folks there got Berserk.
2156420	2160020	Some folks were saying it was Sword Quest, which was a really good guess, but unfortunately
2160020	2161020	not right.
2161020	2163780	All right, this next one's a toughie too, and I'll also be impressed if either of you
2163780	2174980	get this.
2174980	2203940	In this game, you are out to rescue Lady P. Lady P is being held by a jungle tribe.
2203940	2209380	You start this game swinging from rope to rope, then you fight crocodiles, then you
2209380	2211380	dodge falling rocks.
2211380	2212380	Can I please answer?
2212380	2213380	Nope.
2213380	2214380	This wasn't Kongo Bongo.
2214380	2215380	No.
2215380	2216380	Um.
2216380	2217380	Rama, you still with us?
2217380	2218380	Yeah, sure.
2218380	2219380	I know what the game is.
2219380	2220380	I just can't remember the title.
2220380	2223980	It's not Donkey Kong Jr., is it?
2223980	2229540	Ten seconds, no.
2229540	2235740	Lady P, jungle tribe, swinging ropes, fighting crocodiles, dodging falling rocks.
2235740	2238980	You do all that in Jungle Hunt.
2238980	2239980	Jungle Hunt.
2239980	2240980	All right.
2240980	2241980	Still three nothing in Loki's favor.
2241980	2242980	You can still win it though.
2242980	2243980	Okay.
2243980	2244980	All right.
2244980	2245980	I got an easier one for you this time.
2245980	2246980	All right.
2246980	2247980	You ready?
2247980	2248980	Ready.
2248980	2249980	Here.
2249980	2250980	Here we go.
2250980	2251980	Pac-Man.
2251980	2252980	Oh my God.
2252980	2253980	That was fast.
2253980	2257720	He knew it right from the starting tone there.
2257720	2259700	It was Pac-Man.
2259700	2264220	Let's play a little more of that because I barely got to hear any of it.
2264220	2266220	Remember little ghost chasing noises?
2266220	2268620	Now here we go.
2268620	2270100	Yeah, there it is.
2270100	2274260	Based on a very popular arcade game, but it was considered a disappointment, the home
2274260	2275260	version.
2275260	2277620	I have a poster for this at my work.
2277620	2280940	You eat a wafer for bonus points in Pac-Man.
2280940	2281940	Look at that.
2281940	2282940	Damn.
2282940	2283940	All right.
2283940	2284940	That's all right.
2284940	2285980	There's four left.
2285980	2288460	So Rama, you can still tie it up.
2288460	2289460	Working on it.
2289460	2290460	All right.
2290460	2291460	It's all right, Rama.
2291460	2292460	It was a long time ago.
2292460	2294660	I barely remember these when I was playing through them today.
2294660	2295660	All right.
2295660	2296660	Now this one is fun.
2296660	2299860	This one's a tricky one, but I love this game.
2299860	2304500	Burger time.
2304500	2306500	No.
2306500	2308500	Popeye.
2308500	2314980	Oh, Rama gets one.
2314980	2315980	That's right.
2315980	2316980	That's right.
2316980	2317980	It sounded familiar.
2317980	2318980	That's right.
2318980	2322060	Of course, you can kind of hear a little theme being used in the game.
2322060	2326180	There was a movie out around the same time, and remember, this was a really cool game
2326180	2330300	at the time because the stages were so unique, and in that first stage that you were hearing,
2330300	2334500	olive oil was actually throwing hearts down that you had to catch before they sank in
2334500	2335500	the water.
2335500	2336700	Rama is on the board.
2336700	2337700	Good job, Rama.
2337700	2340580	See, now you don't get shut out, and that feels good.
2340580	2341580	So all right.
2341580	2342580	Yeah.
2342580	2343580	All right.
2343580	2344580	Well, keep it up, Rama.
2344580	2345580	All right.
2345580	2346580	Let's do the next one.
2346580	2347580	Three left.
2347580	2348580	Here we go.
2348580	2360700	I need a more specific answer.
2360700	2361940	Pitfall 2.
2361940	2364900	Yes, it's Pitfall 2.
2364900	2365900	Oh.
2365900	2367380	Oh, poor Rama.
2367380	2368820	It is Pitfall 2.
2368820	2371900	It was one of the first games to feature a full soundtrack.
2371900	2376420	The sequel to another popular Atari game in the main character was Pitfall Harry.
2376420	2378140	Rama so close.
2378140	2379140	You know what?
2379140	2381340	Just because Loki pisses me off sometimes, I'm going to give that to you anyway.
2381340	2383340	We're going to give it to you.
2383340	2384340	All right.
2384340	2385340	All right.
2385340	2386340	So there we go.
2386340	2387340	So what do we have?
2387340	2388340	Four for Loki.
2388340	2389340	Two for Rama.
2389340	2390340	All right.
2390340	2391340	Here we go.
2391340	2392340	Let's go to another one.
2392340	2393340	This one is also very hard.
2393340	2394340	Here we go.
2394340	2395340	Bump and jump.
2395340	2396340	Bump and jump.
2396340	2407500	No.
2407500	2410980	This game was also based on a popular movie series.
2410980	2411980	Star Trek?
2411980	2412980	No.
2412980	2413980	Star Wars?
2413980	2414980	Nope.
2414980	2415980	DC?
2415980	2416980	Nope.
2416980	2425340	You can walk into a phone booth to change from one character to another.
2425340	2426340	Superman?
2426340	2427340	Yes.
2427340	2428340	Rama got it.
2428340	2429340	It was Superman.
2429340	2430340	Ah.
2430340	2431340	Remember the Superman game?
2431340	2432340	No.
2432340	2433340	It was great.
2433340	2436660	It was so weird because like you could fly up and you would fly into another screen.
2436660	2439220	Like you moved up, down, left, and right.
2439220	2440220	Like it was weird.
2440220	2441220	It was very weird.
2441220	2442220	There you go.
2442220	2443220	Rama's got three now.
2443220	2444220	Well, because you gave him one.
2444220	2445220	Yeah, I did.
2445220	2446220	I totally gave him one.
2446220	2447220	All right.
2447220	2448220	That's all right.
2448220	2449220	Let's see if you can tie it up, Rama.
2449220	2450220	This is the last one.
2450220	2451220	All right.
2451220	2452220	And this is a doozy.
2452220	2453420	This is a hell of a game.
2453420	2455420	Here we go.
2455420	2459420	Ms. Pac-Man.
2459420	2461420	No.
2461420	2465420	Pac-Man 2.
2465420	2467100	No.
2467100	2470420	This game was made by Mystique Entertainment.
2470420	2472420	Adventure?
2472420	2474420	No.
2474420	2476420	No.
2476420	2485420	It's a highly controversial game that shows up on lots of gag Atari 2600 lists.
2485420	2486420	Custer's Revenge.
2486420	2487420	Ah.
2487420	2488420	Good job, Loki.
2488420	2489420	It is Custer's Revenge.
2489420	2494060	And, of course, the object of the game, your naked ass has to fuck an Indian girl lots
2494060	2495060	and lots.
2495060	2497060	And that's why the game is very controversial.
2497060	2498060	You were just playing that earlier.
2498060	2499060	Yeah.
2499060	2500060	That's when I was recording the clips.
2500060	2501060	Oh my God.
2501060	2502060	That was so funny.
2502060	2504060	That's why you couldn't play because you walked in here when I was setting it up.
2504060	2505060	Oh, yeah.
2505060	2506060	All right.
2506060	2507060	You got the score.
2507060	2512380	Rama, you got three points, a very good showing, and, unfortunately, Loki beat you with five,
2512380	2515580	so, unfortunately, you got beat by the host tonight, but you made a damn good effort on
2515580	2516580	a very tough topic.
2516580	2517580	Thanks, man.
2517580	2518580	I appreciate it.
2518580	2519820	No problemo.
2519820	2524300	Take any shout-outs or plugs you want to give, as long as we have you on the air as a consolation
2524300	2525300	prize.
2525300	2529660	Visit my website, www.djromas.net.
2529660	2530660	There you go.
2530660	2531660	Take us from Bonneville 7RL.
2531660	2532660	All right.
2532660	2533660	Sounds good.
2533660	2534660	Thanks, Rama.
2534660	2535660	Take care.
2535660	2536660	All right.
2536660	2541060	Now, the audio looked a little low to me on the board here, but it seems like the chat
2541060	2545220	room was able to play along just fine, so I'm hoping the audio was just fine there as
2545220	2547540	far as things went.
2547540	2549820	Otherwise, I'll have to fix that in post-production.
2549820	2550820	We'll see.
2550820	2552820	I think we're good, though.
2552820	2554500	Live radio, boys and girls.
2554500	2557060	Take it or leave it.
2557060	2558580	We're going to go back into some gaming news.
2558580	2560580	Let's talk about the game Turrican.
2560580	2565620	This is a game that was on the Commodore 64, kind of compared to an earlier version of
2565620	2568820	Metroid slash Contra.
2568820	2574140	Turrican was a game that was made for the Commodore 64, however, a German programmer
2574140	2576980	has made a freeware remake of the game.
2576980	2585340	It's called Hurrican, and you can download Hurrican from the site, Hurrican-game.de,
2585340	2586340	because it's German.
2586340	2587480	It's a 40-megabyte game.
2587480	2591780	It's Windows-compatible, and if you remember gaming on the Commodore 64, you're probably
2591780	2596540	going to love this, so check it out, Hurrican.
2596540	2601220	Another game that's getting a sequel, and it's long due, I think, and this is, I guess,
2601220	2607540	a rumor for right now, but Parasite Eve is slated on possibly coming out to the PlayStation
2607540	2616820	3 and 360, and no word exactly on any details on that, but I don't know.
2616820	2621500	I guess people are thinking, because they originally announced Parasite Eve 3 as a mobile
2621500	2625220	game, but they're thinking this is going to be something else.
2625220	2632900	This is also, I guess, Quarterman from EGM is saying that they're going to be, Dio Kojima
2632900	2638660	is going to be working on another PS3 exclusive title.
2638660	2639820	No word on what that is.
2639820	2646660	People are thinking maybe Zone of Enders or something like that.
2646660	2649380	That's pretty much it.
2649380	2652500	Well I would hope Parasite Eve is actually going to get the full-blown next-gen treatment,
2652500	2653940	not just some shitty cell phone game.
2653940	2654940	I hope so.
2654940	2656420	Weren't you a fan of Parasite Eve, Rice Princess?
2656420	2658580	I still remember you were the person that introduced me to that.
2658580	2659580	I was?
2659580	2660580	Or I'm smoking crack.
2660580	2661580	Maybe I'm smoking crack.
2661580	2663020	I thought it was a good game.
2663020	2666280	I never actually beat it, but I played through a good part of it.
2666280	2668820	That was me in most Final Fantasy games.
2668820	2670300	I like the combat system in that.
2670300	2674500	The combat system in the first Parasite Eve reminds me much of what they're doing in Final
2674500	2680820	Fantasy XII right now, how that system, you have a big dome or whatever that you can attack
2680820	2681820	in and stuff.
2681820	2685000	It reminds me very much of that.
2685000	2688960	Well before we get to the Skype line, I've got one more story for you guys.
2688960	2693860	Since it is July 1st, also known as Canada Day, I thought those you Canadians would appreciate
2693860	2695900	this.
2695900	2699860	You can get a red PlayStation 3 and it's a special Canada event.
2699860	2702060	You can only get this in Canada.
2702060	2704060	It's actually a contest that's being held.
2704060	2709740	The contest is being run through July 15th at PlayStation.ca and you can actually win
2709740	2716020	yourself a red PlayStation 3 or a limited edition Canada PlayStation 3 t-shirt there.
2716020	2719140	It doesn't have the maple leaf on it, but it has a 3 in place of the maple leaf.
2719140	2721860	Otherwise it kind of looks like the Canadian flag.
2721860	2723180	So there you go.
2723180	2727700	Only 3 of those red PlayStation 3s by the way will be made.
2727700	2728940	So that's kind of neat.
2728940	2733020	Well technically 4 since there's already been a red PlayStation 3 out there custom made.
2733020	2734020	Well that's different though.
2734020	2737100	It's kind of officially endorsed so to speak by Sony.
2737100	2740960	So I know we have some Canadian listeners there so you might want to go enter that contest
2740960	2742840	and brag to all your friends, eh?
2742840	2747120	This is completely random, but I feel that we should talk about this real quick.
2747120	2750580	We went over the fries the other day because I had my motherboard.
2750580	2751580	There's a fan that went out.
2751580	2754660	My computer is kind of on the fritz.
2754660	2759660	But Nelly picked up this USB stripper.
2759660	2761840	It's on a stripping pole that you can buy.
2761840	2764460	I've seen that before because we were thinking about getting it for her for her birthday
2764460	2766500	before we realized we were all freaking poor.
2766500	2768340	I thought that was funny.
2768340	2769340	I don't know.
2769340	2770340	That was great.
2770340	2771340	Did you guys actually see it in motion or what?
2771340	2776860	No, but we almost bought it and then like common sense kicked in and we said no we probably
2776860	2779820	don't need a $30 USB stripper.
2779820	2780820	Why not?
2780820	2781820	I don't know.
2781820	2788420	Because she wanted to take it to work and you know her work wouldn't really think too
2788420	2790420	highly of that.
2790420	2793900	All right, well we're going to open up the Skype line.
2793900	2801500	If you'd like to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can call us on the actual program Skype.
2801500	2803340	Orange Lounge Radio is our username.
2803340	2807580	We always like to hear from our listeners and get your guys' two cents on what's going
2807580	2809540	on in the gaming scene and the gaming community.
2809540	2813440	If you have any feedback to tonight's articles or what have you or you just want to tell
2813440	2817500	Rice Princess to say hi to you and actually talk on the program tonight, all of that you
2817500	2820140	can do by calling our program.
2820140	2822900	So while we wait for some calls because there's a little bit of a lag, do you have any last
2822900	2823900	minute stories?
2823900	2824900	No.
2824900	2825900	No?
2825900	2826900	No last minute stories tonight?
2826900	2827900	Not at the moment.
2827900	2828900	Oh my gosh.
2828900	2829900	It really is a slow gaming week.
2829900	2835580	I was looking for stuff but I haven't seen anything.
2835580	2837780	Well should I pick up Project Silpheed?
2837780	2842540	I haven't, I saw it scroll by your screen there and I'm curious about that game but
2842540	2843540	I don't know.
2843540	2844540	It looks okay.
2844540	2845700	I want to get this t-shirt.
2845700	2850140	It looks like one of those Target t-shirts, like the Don't Bother Me ones and it says
2850140	2859620	good and it has the male, female, almost looks like a restroom logo or something and that's
2859620	2864000	good and then better has a guy with two girls and then best shows a guy playing a video
2864000	2865000	game.
2865000	2867300	We're finally getting calls, thank God.
2867300	2872940	Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?
2872940	2874940	Hello you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?
2874940	2875940	Oh damn it, it didn't work.
2875940	2876940	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lawn's Radio.
2876940	2877940	Wow.
2877940	2894860	If you always want to test your Skype line, you can do that by calling Echo 1-2-3.
2894860	2898860	This is a username on Skype if you'd always like to test your connection in advance which
2898860	2899860	we highly recommend.
2899860	2901860	Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?
2901860	2902860	Hey it's DJ Tyrant.
2902860	2903860	Hey!
2903860	2905860	What's up DJ Tyrant, how are you doing?
2905860	2906860	Whoa.
2906860	2912220	Hey I'm doing pretty good, I'm at Anime Expo 2007 right now.
2912220	2913220	Awesome, how's Anime?
2913220	2917140	Now you actually got into Anime Expo 2007 on behalf of Orange Lawn's Radio right?
2917140	2918420	Yes I did.
2918420	2922940	Alright, then you better have a good report for us, what's going on at Anime Expo?
2922940	2932340	Uh, lots of anime and stuff, there's actually a lot of gaming stuff also, what did I check
2932340	2933340	out today?
2933340	2938300	I checked out the Naruto fighting game for the Wii, those are a little sloppy for that
2938300	2939300	though.
2939300	2942180	Oh, wait, what was sloppy, the controls are sloppy?
2942180	2943180	Yeah.
2943180	2944180	Oh that sucks.
2944180	2951780	But um, there's Guilty Gear, the U1XX, forget the subtitle for that, but.
2951780	2952780	Accent Core.
2952780	2955260	Look, he says it's Accent Core.
2955260	2957260	Yeah, that sounds right.
2957260	2962460	I didn't get to play it, but it looked pretty solid.
2962460	2967100	Interesting, so I don't usually go to Anime Expos where there's a lot of game presence
2967100	2971180	there, but it sounds like a few game companies are making their way out to Anime Expo to
2971180	2972180	plug their stuff?
2972180	2977980	Yeah, they are, apparently Square has a bunch of stuff for Oven, I didn't get to swing by
2977980	2982820	their booth because I don't play Oven, but I saw a lot of people with stuff from Final
2982820	2983820	Fantasy 11.
2983820	2986940	Oh my god, that was like E3 a couple years ago, we did nothing but play at the Square
2986940	2989940	booth on their Final Fantasy 11 events, that was when I was sadly sadly addicted.
2989940	2992980	I bet there's a lot of people still really addicted.
2992980	2994540	Remember, you won a hard drive.
2994540	2996140	I did, that's right.
2996140	3000220	My computer actually came from that Final Fantasy event in my first E3, but anyway,
3000220	3001220	that's another story.
3001220	3005620	I was going to ask, I was going to say, video game cosplay is very popular, have you seen
3005620	3008020	any cool cosplay while you've been there?
3008020	3015380	Yeah, there's tons, there's a while attic, I found about three really really good costumes,
3015380	3021820	and I'll post some pictures up when I get home, but they're like really well done,
3021820	3026980	they look exactly like they look in game, which I found really impressive.
3026980	3031380	Now Rama would like to point out for those of us here, that Anime Expo is not an anime
3031380	3036060	con, it's a trade show, and apparently there's a very distinct difference, I guess because
3036060	3043060	I don't follow the con scene enough, it kind of feels the same to me, but, I see.
3043060	3046020	Well what about, you said there was some gaming stuff there, what about tournaments, is there
3046020	3048940	any big tournaments, or I know these cons usually have a game room, what kinds of stuff
3048940	3049940	have been around in the game?
3049940	3056260	Yeah, there's a pretty big console room with Guitar Hero and the typical fighting type
3056260	3058260	games.
3058260	3063020	There was a Pokemon tournament last night, and there's been various fighting game tournaments
3063020	3069100	for Guilty Gear and Naruto, there's a Smash Bros tournament tomorrow that I will be playing
3069100	3073940	in and losing in the first round, and so, there's definitely a lot of stuff for gamers
3073940	3075980	to do at the show.
3075980	3076980	Very cool.
3076980	3080160	A Super Smash Bros tournament, man, that game's been out for how long, and it's still so,
3080160	3081160	so popular.
3081160	3087260	Yet I didn't hear you say DDR or Beat Mania or any of those games that we used to go to
3087260	3088260	all the time.
3088260	3093620	No, the DDR music games kind of, I don't know, they've kind of died off in popularity over
3093620	3094620	here on the West Coast.
3094620	3095620	Ouch.
3095620	3102260	Otherwise, there is an arcade, though, and they are pretty busy with Supernova and Extreme,
3102260	3106860	and I think Drum Mania V.
3106860	3109380	So how long is the con running?
3109380	3110380	How long is the con?
3110380	3111380	Tomorrow.
3111380	3112380	It ends tomorrow?
3112380	3113380	Yeah.
3113380	3117140	All right, well, make sure you go get your hands on Guilty Gear for us, and you can give
3117140	3118140	some impressions of it.
3118140	3119140	Definitely, definitely will.
3119140	3120140	All right.
3120140	3124620	Rama would like to clarify, Anime Expo is a trade show because their board of directors
3124620	3128340	are people from the anime industry, and they use Anime Expo to promote new titles more
3128340	3129660	than any other con.
3129660	3135340	Think of Anime Expo as the anime equivalent of E3, and Insanus adds to that, also, Anime
3135340	3136340	Expo sucks.
3136340	3140260	Well, that's an opinion, but you sound like you're having a lot of fun at the con, right?
3140260	3141260	Right, Jimmy?
3141260	3144820	All right, he just wants the QQ, give me a hand and come and do it.
3144820	3148880	All right, well, Jimmy, anything else you want to add about the convention?
3148880	3151860	If you can come next year, we can come hang out, I'll buy drinks.
3151860	3154420	Oh, hey, if there's drinks there, I'm there.
3154420	3157700	But I will be in SoCal for E for All, so we'll see you then.
3157700	3160140	All right, have a nice night, guys.
3160140	3161140	All right, later, buddy.
3161140	3162140	Thanks for the call.
3162140	3163140	Bye.
3163140	3164140	Bye.
3164140	3166700	Our roving reporter, Jimmy, also known as DJ Tyrant.
3166700	3168460	All right, let's go to the phones.
3168460	3170060	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.
3170060	3171060	Who's this?
3171060	3172060	It's GS68.
3172060	3173060	Hello, GS68.
3173060	3175060	What's on your mind, my friend?
3175060	3180100	First of all, it wasn't me calling before I met because my mic wasn't set up right.
3180100	3181100	It's all right.
3181100	3182100	We'll forgive you.
3182100	3185740	All right, you're the one, could you hear us yelling at you in Spanish and everything?
3185740	3186740	Yeah.
3186740	3187740	All right.
3187740	3188740	That's got to be embarrassing.
3188740	3189740	All right, well, now you're on.
3189740	3190740	What's on your mind?
3190740	3196700	First of all, I was eating cup noodles when rice persons were staying angry, so I had
3196700	3200300	to spit that out.
3200300	3203780	That is probably going to be one of those OLR taglines that's beaten into the ground,
3203780	3204780	but that's all right.
3204780	3205780	It is kind of funny.
3205780	3206780	I just hope nobody takes it the wrong way.
3206780	3209700	Like, I don't want, like, somebody who's, like, uninformed on this program to be all,
3209700	3212180	like, they use the word bag too much in their program.
3212180	3215100	Anyway, what else do you want to talk about tonight, GS68?
3215100	3221900	Yeah, I've been, like, on a Guitar Hero message board, I've been talking about the hyper speed
3221900	3224300	code lately and how some people think it's a cheat.
3224300	3225540	Like, what are your thoughts on it?
3225540	3227380	I do not know of the hyper speed code.
3227380	3228500	Give me a little background on this.
3228500	3230580	What's this about?
3230580	3236940	On the Guitar Hero 2 title screen, you press orange, blue, orange, yellow, orange, blue,
3236940	3240700	orange, yellow, and then it says cheat activated hyper speed.
3240700	3242580	And what exactly does that do to the game?
3242580	3245060	Does it make the songs run faster or something?
3245060	3247180	No, it makes the notes scroll faster.
3247180	3252060	It's kind of like times two speed in DDR or high speed in Beatmania.
3252060	3255940	Oh, okay, well, I don't know if that's cheating or not.
3255940	3260220	I mean, I guess maybe the developers intended it to be a cheat if that's what they're labeling
3260220	3264700	it as in the game, but I don't know, like, in Beatmania, I never considered that a cheat.
3264700	3267780	I mean, God, that's what you have to use to play some of those songs.
3267780	3268980	I don't know any other way.
3268980	3272660	But I don't know, maybe it is cheating, even in Beatmania, and for whatever reason the
3272660	3275220	community doesn't really look at it that way.
3275220	3278180	But I think they just never looked at it that way because it's always been considered a
3278180	3279180	modifier.
3279180	3280180	Yeah.
3280180	3286500	Because, like, people whose music gaming experience is one of the Guitar Hero, like, have never
3286500	3291260	heard of it being a mod, so when they saw that it was a cheat, they automatically thought
3291260	3294240	it was a cheat because it says cheat activated.
3294240	3295940	What are your thoughts on it?
3295940	3297900	Well, I think it's legit.
3297900	3302780	I mean, if you think it helps you, just use it.
3302780	3309380	I mean, it's been out of the money gates for years without question, so why call it cheating
3309380	3310380	now?
3310380	3312220	I mean, it's still the same notes, right?
3312220	3313220	Yeah.
3313220	3316020	And it's not going to help you beat Jordan on Expert, right?
3316020	3318140	Probably, probably not.
3318140	3322260	So what's the big freaking deal?
3322260	3326340	I mean, if you close your eyes and play the song, I mean, does Hyperspeed really make
3326340	3327340	a difference?
3327340	3331660	Well, if you close your eyes and play the song, is that how you have to beat Jordan
3331660	3332660	Expert?
3332660	3333660	Probably, huh?
3333660	3337820	Well, if you for some reason memorized the song, I mean...
3337820	3343220	I think if you've actually gone to the great extents to memorize Guitar Hero 2 songs, instead
3343220	3349020	of using the speed modifier, I would recommend you go outside.
3349020	3350020	I'm just messing.
3350020	3351020	Hypothetically speaking.
3351020	3352020	I know, I know.
3352020	3355780	Hey, people memorize the DDR songs, so why not the Guitar Hero songs?
3355780	3356780	It happens.
3356780	3357780	Yeah.
3357780	3359780	All right, well, any other thoughts, GS68?
3359780	3362020	No, that's pretty much it.
3362020	3365260	All right, well, thank you so much for the call, and have a great night, and thanks for
3365260	3366260	calling.
3366260	3367260	All right, thank you too.
3367260	3368260	All right, later.
3368260	3369260	Later.
3369260	3373140	All right, let's go to some more calls here on the Skype line, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3373140	3374140	Let's go to this call.
3374140	3375140	Oops.
3375140	3378380	If I can, go to the next call.
3378380	3382100	The call I was just about to pick up dropped, live radio, boys and girls.
3382100	3383100	Good one, Rock.
3383100	3384100	Geez.
3384100	3385100	It happens all the fucking time.
3385100	3386100	Let's go to this call.
3386100	3387100	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3387100	3388100	Who's this?
3388100	3389100	It'll be Dark Knight.
3389100	3390100	Hello, Dark Knight.
3390100	3391100	What's on your mind?
3391100	3392100	Nothing much.
3392100	3394300	Thought y'all would talk about Soul Calibur for a little bit.
3394300	3397300	I wanted to touch up on something I discussed last week.
3397300	3398300	Sure.
3398300	3400020	Soul Calibur IV online, good stuff.
3400020	3401020	What's up?
3401020	3405700	It's supposed to be like a side story game, Soul Calibur Legends.
3405700	3406700	Yes.
3406700	3409700	This is the game that's being created for the Nintendo Wii, if I remember right, right?
3409700	3410700	It's not side-scrolling, though.
3410700	3411700	It's just kind of a hack-and-slash.
3411700	3412700	Yeah.
3412700	3419340	Wasn't that how Mortal Kombat, what was that, Shallon Monks or whatever was kind of like
3419340	3420340	that?
3420340	3421340	Yeah.
3421340	3422340	Oh, okay.
3422340	3423340	That might be kind of cool.
3423340	3424340	I was thinking more of Tekken Force.
3424340	3428060	Oh, like one of the adventure modes that you get in the Tekken games?
3428060	3432020	I would say it looks more like the Mortal Kombat Shallon Monks games, because I know
3432020	3434740	Tekken Force is more like Final Fight or something like that.
3434740	3438020	Here's the only thing I care about, is Ivy in it, yes or no?
3438020	3439020	Yes.
3439020	3440020	Sold.
3440020	3444900	I think it's mostly reviving around Siegfried, I think, if I'm not mistaken.
3444900	3445900	All right.
3445900	3447900	Well, what else have you heard on the game?
3447900	3454340	Just early development details and whatnot, they had a picture on it on Kotaku.com, and
3454340	3459300	it just looked like a test shot, because all I saw was basically Siegfried swinging a sword
3459300	3462300	around a bunch of mummies.
3462300	3468660	I mean, I like the concept and all, so.
3468660	3472020	Is it the type of game you think you're going to buy?
3472020	3473500	I don't own a Wii, so.
3473500	3474500	Oh, you don't own a Wii?
3474500	3475500	I can't really answer that question.
3475500	3478620	Is that because you don't want one or because you can't find one?
3478620	3479620	Both.
3479620	3483780	I actually decided that I was going to go get a 360.
3483780	3484780	Ah, okay.
3484780	3485780	All right.
3485780	3488220	But that won't be until November's top with the office itself.
3488220	3489220	Well, you never know.
3489220	3492460	If you ever luck out, maybe the game will come out cross-platform.
3492460	3495900	Yeah, give it time and whatnot.
3495900	3501340	Another game I had on mind, but I think I just totally lost track.
3501340	3502340	Guitar Hero 80s.
3502340	3506980	I actually saw Dom's song, Glitz, and everything, and there are actually some decent songs that
3506980	3507980	I loved.
3507980	3508980	I don't know why some of y'all didn't like it.
3508980	3509980	Some of y'all wasn't liking some of the songs.
3509980	3510980	Yeah, what's your problem, Rice Princess?
3510980	3513980	Why didn't you like Guitar Hero's 80s editions?
3513980	3514980	What's your big issue?
3514980	3518380	Well, if I knew what any of the songs were, I might like it better.
3518380	3521300	I mean, listen to Butt Rock in the 80s.
3521300	3522420	That's just because you're a child.
3522420	3523420	How old are you, Rice Princess?
3523420	3524420	I'm a child.
3524420	3525580	I am not a child.
3525580	3527060	People in the chatroom are children.
3527060	3529060	How old are you?
3529060	3530060	72.
3530060	3532580	You're not 72, and you weren't born in 72.
3532580	3533580	73.
3533580	3534580	Come on, how old are you?
3534580	3535580	I'm 25.
3535580	3536580	25.
3536580	3537580	See, she's just a baby.
3537580	3538580	I am not a baby.
3538580	3540460	How could you call me a baby?
3540460	3541780	25 is not a baby.
3541780	3543780	How could you call me a baby?
3543780	3548660	If you're older than most of the people in the chatroom, you're not a baby.
3548660	3550540	You're a baby.
3550540	3553300	Do you remember Friendship Bracelets and Garbage Pail Kids?
3553300	3554300	Yeah.
3554300	3555300	Do you remember Slap Bracelets?
3555300	3556300	Yes, I do.
3556300	3557300	Yeah.
3557300	3558300	Those were pretty awesome.
3558300	3559300	And Hypercolor Shirts.
3559300	3560300	Yeah, I do.
3560300	3561300	Yeah, anyway.
3561300	3562300	All right.
3562300	3563300	Anyhow.
3563300	3564300	Well, then I don't know what her problem is.
3564300	3565580	She was just listening to the wrong kind of music in the 80s.
3565580	3566580	The wrong kind of music?
3566580	3567580	No, I don't.
3567580	3570500	I have to admit, I'm not that excited about the track list either, Dark Knight.
3570500	3575380	There's some songs that made me go, woohoo, but a lot of it kind of makes me go, hmm.
3575380	3576660	Not really a memorable song.
3576660	3579620	But what to you makes a song list great?
3579620	3581980	Convince us we're wrong.
3581980	3582980	Give me Stairway.
3582980	3585300	I mean, Turn the Japanese might be one.
3585300	3588780	But if I had the power to add a song, give me Stairway to Heaven.
3588780	3589860	I know exactly.
3589860	3592860	No stairway denied.
3592860	3593860	I know.
3593860	3594860	Wow.
3594860	3595860	All right.
3595860	3596860	Dark Knight, we've got to let you go.
3596860	3598860	Any last thoughts real quick?
3598860	3604500	Um, also, um, you need to start playing PSU again because, um, well, that's why you have
3604500	3605500	360.
3605500	3606500	You probably already got it.
3606500	3608700	But they recently gave out Sonic statues.
3608700	3609700	Really?
3609700	3610700	Everybody.
3610700	3614500	No, God, I haven't touched the game in forever, but I think my membership is still active
3614500	3615500	and I'm paying for it.
3615500	3617060	I just haven't gone into the game in forever.
3617060	3618060	So we'll see.
3618060	3620180	Yeah, everybody got a Sonic statue now.
3620180	3621180	It's you know what?
3621180	3624020	I pull me away from World of Warcraft, seriously.
3624020	3627540	And I feel like I know I'm going to get so much hate mail, like Rob, play a real game.
3627540	3632260	But I can't explain how addicting this game is and it's the social end of it completely
3632260	3635180	because of the fact that a lot of my friends play it.
3635180	3637620	It's not even really the game itself that I'm in love with.
3637620	3638620	I'm in love with Ventrilo.
3638620	3639620	That's my problem.
3639620	3646740	I'm not going to go into detail about the Ventrilo thing, but I mean, it is right now
3646740	3652100	the game is just, I think it's kind of winding down now because the expansion is coming.
3652100	3655340	Well I, it'll be, hopefully, hopefully the expansion will give it a good badly needed
3655340	3658460	kick in the pants because I would like to get back into some PSU.
3658460	3666900	Anyway, quick plug for my show because I do a show on This is Genius Radio, Dark Knight
3666900	3671700	Ninja Dojo on Thursday nights, welcome to join if you like, basically going to be talking
3671700	3673700	about this week, the iPhone.
3673700	3674860	Ooh, iPhone.
3674860	3675860	I saw one this week.
3675860	3676860	They're very pretty.
3676860	3680260	Well I will try to tune in and I think I'm supposed to be on the show this week or very
3680260	3681260	soon.
3681260	3682260	Yes?
3682260	3683260	Yes.
3683260	3684260	Yes.
3684260	3688460	I just have to double check my personal calendar, but I should be there.
3688460	3689460	Okay.
3689460	3690460	All right.
3690460	3691460	That's it.
3691460	3692460	All right.
3692460	3693460	Take care, buddy.
3693460	3694460	Thanks for calling.
3694460	3695460	Bye, folks.
3695460	3696460	All right.
3696460	3700580	Dark Knight here on Orange Launch Radio and everybody's got their own show these days.
3700580	3701580	I swear to God.
3701580	3702580	I swear to God.
3702580	3703580	No, it's all good though.
3703580	3704580	I like Dark Knight.
3704580	3705580	Hi, you're on.
3705580	3710220	I'm going to punch that guy in the face.
3710220	3711220	You know who you are.
3711220	3712220	Punch him in the ass.
3712220	3714220	You told me you fixed it.
3714220	3717500	Now that's another edit.
3717500	3719140	Ah, forget it.
3719140	3720140	I'm not going to edit that out.
3720140	3722020	Podcast listeners, you guys can deal with it.
3722020	3723020	Way to be lazy.
3723020	3724020	That was DMN, by the way.
3724020	3728100	If you want to hate somebody for blowing your ears out, that was Insanist, DMN, whatever
3728100	3729500	the hell your name is right now.
3729500	3730500	Love you.
3730500	3732500	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3732500	3733500	Who's this?
3733500	3734500	Mushy Mushy.
3734500	3735500	Mushy Mushy?
3735500	3736500	No, it's relevant.
3736500	3737500	Oh, like you're saying hello.
3737500	3746140	I hear myself.
3746140	3747140	It's okay.
3747140	3748140	Sometimes there is a bit of an echo.
3748140	3749140	Identify yourself, please.
3749140	3750140	Nintendo Maniac 64.
3750140	3751140	Nintendo Maniac 64.
3751140	3752140	What's on your mind, my friend?
3752140	3753140	Well, dealing with the Japanese thing.
3753140	3754140	What was it?
3754140	3755140	You got a letter.
3755140	3756140	Is this your first Japanese listener on the show?
3756140	3757140	Is that a letter in the book?
3757140	3758140	No, I think Peekers.
3758140	3759140	Peekers.
3759140	3760140	Peekers.
3760140	3761140	Peekers.
3761140	3762140	Peekers.
3762140	3763140	Peekers.
3763140	3764140	Peekers.
3764140	3765140	Peekers.
3765140	3766140	Peekers.
3766140	3767140	Peekers.
3767140	3771100	And also I think Peeker Uno is also in Japan from my following him on Twitter.
3771100	3772420	Because I actually have a Twitter account.
3772420	3775000	And some of the listeners have me added on there as Sky on Twitter.
3775000	3776820	And I picked up the He's in Japan.
3776820	3779740	Who is the really Japanese, though?
3779740	3786100	I haven't the foggiest idea, but I'm sure I'm going to get a Twitter about it now.
3786100	3789420	The message is Japanese.
3789420	3791320	Actually, I've looked at the statistics.
3791320	3792700	We do have some Japanese listeners.
3792700	3795220	We have listeners all over the world, just not all of them are vocal.
3795220	3796220	But I understand.
3796220	3800700	lot of effort to write an email so I you know no expectations but I don't think
3800700	3804940	this guy's the first one but he's the first email I can recall getting from
3804940	3811100	Japan but we have had emails from other parts of Asia okay so other than that
3811100	3817580	uh oh yeah you know I returned out earlier with the it was like a bad were
3817580	3821580	some wording that one like brain-age knockoff game or something yeah mind
3821580	3826900	quiz yeah did you see the image link that said you had the actual the phrase
3826900	3830860	and stuff in it I did thank you so yes we did find out and confirm that the
3830860	3835860	word is well I can't say it because it's bad spastic oh my god Loki now we're
3835860	3840940	gonna have to put an explicit tag on the show you bastard ah so I don't know
3840940	3844220	well I don't know cuz culturally over here that's not really a bad word but I
3844220	3848500	suppose you know if the game had called me a fag I may not like wait you know
3848500	3853260	who we could ask wait no wait where's a bad word in England yes we can ask

3857340	3860660	sleeping is red kind of late over there in Britain right now so we don't have a
3860660	3865100	lot of I'll ask him all right you do that call him a spastic and sees what
3865100	3871580	happens oh no you might make me number two on his myspace anyway I love how
3871580	3876060	rice princess biggest concern in the world is that OMG I might get demoted in
3876060	3880900	the top eight on myspace yeah pretty much get a life woman I can't with my
3880900	3885780	they're gonna happen you know you're instantly well orange launch radio has a
3885780	3888980	myspace so I can't I can't complain too much all right internal maniac anything
3888980	3893740	else on your mind yeah I finally finally got time splitters to I've been trying
3893740	3899580	to find it forever I got it and that smashing glass level it's like but I got
3899580	3904020	golden in like I think like an hour or something like what you think like how
3904020	3907980	it gets really hard like it gets harder as you pass through some of the levels
3907980	3910900	in there what exactly do you do in this level well there's like they have
3910900	3914180	different levels like breaking stuff usually it'll be with a brick or
3914180	3918700	something and you have to smash windows and you have to throw a brick through it
3918700	3928380	and it's it's pretty hard you have to go through and other way all right well
3928380	3930860	we're gonna go ahead and let you go buddy but thanks so much for giving us
3930860	3937540	a call and enjoy time splitters okay yeah all right black later but all right
3937540	3940940	well that's gonna do it tonight for the skype line sorry to those calls we
3940940	3945540	didn't get to we did have a lot of calls coming through but we have a lot we've
3945540	3949780	been on the air quite a while now we got to wrap things up so let's go around now
3949780	3952100	since there's no last-minute stories we're gonna go around and get everybody
3952100	3955980	no no that's not the case oh you found something of course I was taking the
3955980	3962420	time to pull up the stories go for it and the rumor is apparently beautiful
3962420	3965180	katamari is gonna be skipping the PlayStation 3 and going straight to the
3965180	3972420	Wii and it's supposed to be coming out next year on the Wii I'll be honest
3972420	3977100	though I would say it's coming out in both fiscal year 2008 that's just my
3977100	3983860	guess though didn't you get in trouble for that once before no I'm guessing I
3983860	3987700	don't know okay but I would if I were to guess I would say it's coming fiscal
3987700	3993420	year I honestly don't give a fuck anymore I sure I don't give a fuck let
3993420	3997020	the game come out wherever it's gonna come out and maybe I'll buy it if it's
3997020	4002260	not just a copy of the first game exactly um anyways so some other stuff
4002260	4008140	that's gonna be interesting this was kind of a surprise to me although this
4008140	4013060	is one of the only films of his I'm gonna go see postal is being being
4013060	4017580	called what the hell my microphone went out there for a second no I turned the
4017580	4021980	audio and sorry you're fine anyways postal is being called one of the best
4021980	4028180	films and apparently it got standing ovations at cans which is very
4028180	4034740	surprising but um I don't know everybody at the can film festival is on ecstasy
4034740	4041300	apparently it says anyways it says we've all calls it his final statement he says
4041300	4045700	you can make you can't make a more radical movie there is no way you can
4045700	4050140	ignore postal it's one of the funniest and most important films of lack of the
4050140	4054580	last decade it is one of the best films of all times of course this is a wee
4054580	4057220	bull talking about himself were they giving it a standing ovation because they
4057220	4061980	got to leave maybe I don't know I think it looks cheesy I know it's gonna be
4061980	4068060	offensive that's you know that's it a dark tetsuya says or was a way bold just
4068060	4073780	dreaming the whole thing yeah he might have been some other interesting stuff
4073780	4077980	on game that's been announced to be coming to the Wii is called the blob
4077980	4083020	which apparently is going to be kind of similar it was a there was actually a
4083020	4086700	contest it was involved a student project it's kind of a cross between
4086700	4090700	katamari and I guess I don't know you paint buildings with this giant blob of
4090700	4095000	paint and roll it around and stuff so it looks kind of neat will the game also
4095000	4104060	feature a boy no so it can be a boy in his blob get it yeah I got oh my god and
4104060	4108580	then real quick some of the virtual console games coming out here in the
